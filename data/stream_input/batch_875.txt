B000VI70WM|2.0|I have to totally agree with Josephll \\"Reformed Music Addict\\" although I think he gave this album one star too many. The songs on this album are missing guitars which technically makes this not a rock & roll album. The song \\"Tricked Out\\" would be great for Halloween though. I love Duran Duran, but this album is not Duran Duran. It could have been so much better. If you're a Duran Duran fan I would avoid this album unless you hate guitars and love synth music.
B000YXMMAE|3.0|In Rainbows by Radiohead is an album that made me think about how current music is digested nowadays. As not one to let hype get to me in way of opinions in any way, shape or form, I bought this album when it first came out in CD form, a time when their masterpiece, OK Computer, was yet again in heavy rotation in my player. Yet, the press praised this new album as if it was the next coming of music, and many placed it at the top of the year's 'best of' lists.     So, I began thinking that one has to wonder, that with all the online music review websites and downloading systems, that when a new album is released it usually does not have as much jubilation behind it, and sometimes even honesty. The sense of happiness ceases due to the way that many of the songs are leaked to the internet even before their release. The honesty is dying due to both this and how the music press now lays their opinion on thick before one has time to establish their own.     I believe one of the best things about music is when an album seems like it's your discovery, not someone else's. While many need a starting point to know at least what is good, the new way of musical digestion both tells you and lets you hear \\"the good stuff\\" before you can even have the album (with artwork!) in your hand and hear it how it is supposed to be heard: front to back and with booming stereo speakers.     So, a year ago, I listened to In Rainbows just a little bit, but never in full. I did not want my honesty to become nerve-wracking in having to decide if I was sincerely liking or hating it, if I was going with the flow or even trying to be different by not liking it.     Yet, now more than a year later the hype was sure to have left this album, and now all I had to do was listen. And listen I did to give you my honest opinion.     In Rainbows is an album that is not only Radiohead at their most mainstream, but also at their most ordinary. It is an album that has much of Thom Yorke's beautiful, signature vocal work as a focal point, yet not much of what makes his paranoid cry for clairvoyance seem as different from many of Radiohead's influences and knockoffs.     In this album, Radiohead subjects us to their more introverted and quieter side. In fact, much of the album plays out like Yorke's solo album, The Eraser, did. In Rainbows seems as if it is making a case for them as a more radio-friendly, alternative-sounding band, as if almost polite, in fact. Gone is much of the edgy experimentation that accompanies Yorke's they-are-out-to-get-me paranoid ramblings. The music here tries to be much too subtle and arty, thus bordering on indulgent dissonance, and sadly has a feeling of serenity breaking through the horizon. However, the album as a whole is not bad per se, because Yorke's voice sounds like a gentle breeze settling over an ocean wave. Though it can racket up in volume to an operatic rock-and-roll tortured scream, it also seems unfulfilled.     Songs like \\"Weird Fishes / Arpeggi,\\" do nothing to make it seem as if they want to again break barriers, while \\"All I Need\\" and \\"Faust Arp\\" rerun over ground that Yorke has demonstrated on prior, much more epic, experimental, harder rocking and simply better songs. He has shown that he is both a singer of superb passion, encapsulating emotional torment in a thoughtful way, and that there was not much farther to go in crystallizing his voice with both production and accompanying instrumentals by that standpoint.     In this album, his lyrics are poetically sensitive, high and clement, so much so that after a while it sadly rings like a cry for remorse, cut short by a tightened throat holding back tears. Songs like \\"Reckoner\\" and \\"House of Cards\\" are good as they are augmented by string arrangements, but nothing brilliant as the sound is actually too remote, quiet and stifled, undone because Radiohead seems like so many others, as if their sense of subversion has finally gone to the masses. It's as if the album is an annoying Jenga tower that crumbles when the player makes the slightest wrong move.     In Rainbows is at its best with \\"15 Step,\\" \\"Bodysnatchers\\" and the second-to-last-song, \\"Jigsaw Falling Into Place.\\" These songs may have been done before by Radiohead, but no one does it like them. These tracks are the saving grace of the album, and the only reason the album didn't receive only 3 stars. Yet, they also sadly still remind one of what once was.     Honestly, though, more than half of the songs here work in some way (six of the ten, to be exact); there is a certain point in which the listener gets its stifled sentiment, as In Rainbows is another note of alienation and non-subdued anguish, and is done not up to the band's often high standards, seeming like one of the lesser bands it influenced (Muse or Coldplay).     While some love the album, others would rather Yorke and the music to be so scared of itself with both its institutionalized behavior and subversive ethic that both the band members and listeners will be in hospital straps by album's end -- as that is the Radiohead that we all know and love.     *** 1/2 ( Out of 5)
B00000DG1R|5.0|When you talk 80's music you are talking Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, & Pat Benatar. Duran Duran are \\"the\\" band of the 80's and this album has all of their hits that made them \\"the\\" band of the 80's. The remastered mix on this album sounds clearer and more precise than the original albums. You'll love the quality of the audio.
B001ACH4DS|2.0|As a huge David Cook fan on the show, I was very disappointed with this album.  When I placed this order, I was eagerly awaiting my awesome hard rock, possibly metal, album to come in.  When I put it in an listened, I was outright shocked.  This album wouldn't (and in fact doesn't) even qualify to be played on our local rock station here.  This is popular music for the masses.    On track #4 (Come back to me), i wasn't sure if i was listening to David Cook or Neal Diamond.  Come-on- my (our) hard rock star from America Idol doing what is essentially a Neal Diamond impression??    Unless the next album is overtly portrayed as a rock/metal album - clearly what David C. does best per American Idol - I wouldn't even consider buying it.   2 stars was generous.

B001IBIQU6|5.0|I am so happy with this new DM album! I have been a lifelong fan (since age 6...older sister), and I have to say I am so impressed! This is NEW SCHOOL AND OLD SCHOOL DM at it's best! First of all, I actually downloaded this album about a week ago (don't ask me how I got it cause I am not telling), and I have not been able to stop listening to it.    If you notice, the beginning of the song \\"Peace\\" sounds like \\"See You\\"! A lot of the old synth sounds are re-invented classic MODE. I have noticed some beats which are similar to the beats on \\"A Broken Frame\\". Anyway, I will stop comparing this album to early 80's DM. DM went through a major guitar phase on Songs of Faith and Devotion and Ultra. Which were very dark but likeable albums. This album transcends with positivity and up beats...nonetheless down tempo beats like In Chains, Wrong etc.    I am very excited about this album, but more excited about the upcoming tour in which I will be gladly attending at MSG!!! I have seen DM at least 6 times. Can't wait to see Dave Gahan swing around to \\"Question of Time\\" YAY! :)
B001DZ9GRE|4.0|Great collection and a good assortment of rarities on the second disc. It's nice to finally have these videos on DVD! NOTE-This import DVD is NTSC and is  playable on US players. This was the main reason I bought the deluxe edition as the DVD is not available with the US release. The booklet however, is glued in by it's last page which warped it since it's not card stock, why bother?, I would have preferred it to be loose. The only thing that would have made this better would have been a few of the remixes that were done of some of the songs since not all of them were easy to get domestically over the years. Here's to Annie making enough new music to do fill another retrospective in the years to come.
B000BBOV8U|5.0|What does rock 'n' roll mean? I do not exactly know, but I think that this record is pure rock music.   Mr. Adams voice, guitars, drums and, especially his passion make this double CD a great purchase. All the songs are fantastic, my favourite is Please Forgive Me, one of the best love rock 'n' roll songs I have never heard.  Adam´s energy is incredible. His voice is perfect for a rock singer. And the rest of the musicians are a great complement. The lyrics are also fantastic. The pack is very generous: 36 songs and an correct book.  I highly recommend this product.
B001PA0FFO|3.0|I really expected it to be better overall.  I'm not Catholic, I was raised in a very religious home and went to a religious private school.  I rejected Chrisitianity as a whole, and maybe that's why this movie failed to touch me.  The acting was good, but it just seemed lacking.  Not for me.
B001M4YZ90|4.0|While this is a little less a keeper than Lock Stock and Two Loaded Barrels and Snatch it was still good enough to buy.[[ASIN:B001M4YZ90 RocknRolla (Single-Disc Edition)]]
B001IBIQU6|3.0|Rating: 3.5 stars<br /><br />My title says it all.  If you are a DM fan, you will like this album as well. The first three songs are my favs but they all blend together when listening from start to finish.  This is not a standout album but at least four tunes have been added to my permenant collection.<br /><br />I did not think this album was overly dark as noted by others.  I feel it stays true to their pop roots with their unique twist.  A good album to buy when on sale to have the complete DM collection.

B001FBSMW6|5.0|I was completely surprised by how much I loved Perfect Symmetry!  When you hear the beginnings of the first 5 songs you think, \\"Oh no, this sounds like really bad 80s pop music!\\"  But as the songs progress and you allow yourself to go with them, they turn into something much deeper and more interesting than any 80s pop song.  The piano is replaced by synthesizer, but the result is some really catchy synth-pop tunes that grow on you the more you listen to them.  I have to say that \\"Hopes & Fears\\" is one of those rare and perfect CDs that captures you and holds you the whole way through - each song as good or better than the last.  But I appreciate the musical risks Keane took with Perfect Symmetry to create something fresh and surprising rather than just repeat the dependable formula of Hopes & Fears.    My favorite tracks on this CD were \\"Perfect Symmetry,\\" \\"You Don't See Me,\\" and \\"Black Burning Heart.\\"  These three songs were a perfect combination of interesting and emotionally-driven music, passionate piano melodies, and heartfelt and meaningful modern lyrics!  Tom Chaplin's voice soars with passion and beauty and begs you to sing along.  Perfect Symmetry, and these three songs especially, will hopefully get you to feel something about modern life and relationships.  And isn't that why we listen to great music afterall?

B001GKJ2E8|1.0|My title says it.     The plot is ridiculous.  These assassins are given their hit targets as a result of some binary code that mystically appears in fabric that is woven by a loom.  Morgan Freeman, as the leader of the assassins apparently spends a great part of his day peering through a very strong magnifying glass as he looks for a thread here or there that is irregular.  Of course, seeing as he's old and already wearing reading glasses, some interpretation errors result.       The action is even boring because it's so far over the top that it's not even engaging.  A lot of the action involves the ability of the assassins to put a curve on the bullets they shoot.  The penultimate bullet happens to travel in a perfect 360 degree circle as it kills no less than 4-5 people.  And then there is the ability of the assassins to repeatedly hit the bullets of another assassin in mid flight, thereby blocking it, as they duel.  I assume, but don't remember if I ever saw them curving the bullet trajectories in the blocking bullets scenes.               As for acting, Angelina Jolie is almost cartoonish.  Look at her arms (on the cover) which are wimpy if not emaciated, and then compare them to her lips (which look inflated).  All she does during the movie is strike some poses and give some looks with eyes that look she hasn't slept in weeks.      A complete waste of time.

0743497465|1.0|To buy into this story you have to believe the heroine, who works in DC distilling intelligence reports into briefs, is so dumb that she constantly has to ask dopey questions because she can't grasp what is going on around her or what anyone is saying.  And she has to ask these dumb questions because the author thinks the reader is equally dumb and has to be lead by the hand to understand everything.  Cut out the excessive explanations, the perpetual reviews of the action, and the ever-present (bad) foreshadowing (i.e. \\"He wasn't worried. Yet.\\"  \\"If only she had known what was ahead.\\") and the book would be half the size but twice as good. I kept asking myself - how did he convince someone to publish this? Save your money.  Angels and Demons is much better than this.

0307269752|4.0|An international best-selling literary thriller translated from the original Swedish.  What could be cooler than that?  It certainly was enough to hook me and take me well past the point of no return.  It is a good thriller, but what sets it apart is the Swedish setting.  Swedish culture, Swedish politics, Swedish journalism, Swedish relationships, all a bit different from what the American reader is used to --- Swedish relationships in particular.<br /><br />  The book is billed as a literary thriller, and it is certainly well-written and contains commentary on the worlds of journalism and high finance worthy of that moniker.  After a promising start that seems highly realistic, or potentially realistic, however, the plot turns towards more low-brow thriller staples, such as the sadistic, sexual serial killer and the more-brilliant-than-anyone-you've-ever-known-or-will-know protagonist.  Even so, the pages keep turning, and I will certainly read the sequel.  The movie looks good too.  You can watch the preview here: [..]  Don't worry about spoiling the book; if you don't speak Swedish it will not give anything away.<br /><br />  One warning, the book's original title (i.e., in Sweden) was \\"The Man Who Hates Women.\\"  They were wise to change the title for American consumption (I doubt I would have bought it with that title), but some brutal violence towards women the title suggests, while certainly condemned, is still in the book.  If that upsets you, stay away.
B001UE276A|5.0|After three years of waiting, Depeche Mode are back with their 12th original studio release, the epically grand titled: [[ASIN:B001UE276A \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" w/ Deluxe Boxset 3CD/DVD.]]  The band came up with the name quite early on in the process. Songwriter, Martin Gore, has said that the title just felt like it summed up the eclectic nature of the songs and the sounds on the album.  While he feels there is no overall theme, the album tends to focus on different aspects of relationships, both positive and negative.  This is a lighter, more laid back `Mode, with the album a cross between 2001s [[ASIN:B00005BL2A \\"Exciter\\"]] and 2005s [[ASIN:B000B2YQX4 \\"Playing The Angel\\"]] with a little [[ASIN:B000002LK1 \\"Violator\\"]] thrown in for good measure.  In fact, while this isn't DM at their darkest, there are very noticeable moments of darkness on the album, as well as a retro feel.  This is due in part to the fact that, during the recording sessions, Martin would constantly be winning auctions on eBay for classic older electronic equipment, incorporating them into the productions.  As with \\"Playing The Angel,\\" Martin wrote most of the songs on \\"Sounds Of The Universe,\\" with lead singer, Dave Gahan, providing writing credits for three songs (*).        \\"In Chains\\" starts things off with a one minute intro, reminiscent of how a live orchestra sounds like when they're tuning up their instruments.  Only here it's a bunch of electronic equipment that's preparing to play a piece of music, with lots of strange noises and other odd sounds going off one after the other, until all is in readiness.  Then what sounds like an electric organ begins to play the main melody, which almost sounds like something you might hear during a funeral procession.  Until Dave Gahan's voice comes crying out with sexy allure, proclaiming his adulation for the seductive power of the woman he desires, (\\"The way you move, has got me yearning.  The way you move, has left me burning.  I know you know what you're doing to me.  I know my hands will never be free.  I know what it's like to be in chains\\") and the way she controls him (\\"I know I crumble when you are around.  Stutter, mumble, a pitiful sound.  Stagger, stumble, shackled and bound, in chains\\") with her sexual powers of persuasion (\\"You've got me dying for you.  It's you that I'm living through.  You've got me praying to you, saying to you anything you want me to...You've got me reaching for you.  My soul's beseeching me to.  You've got me singing to you, bringing to you anything you ask me to\\") that always wins over in the end.  Martin Gore adds a funky guitar riff throughout the song that gives it a bit more bite, along with his affective backing vocalizations that are always a crowd pleaser.        \\"Hole To Feed,\\"* which sounds more like a Nine Inch Nails title, opens with a cool little beat and an array of retro electric laser beam sounds, as it's formatted interestingly in a chorus-verse-chorus motif.  The song centers on the maintaining of a serious and meaningful relationship. (\\"We are here, we can love. We share something.  I'm sure that you mean the world to me.\\") But with all relationships, there are pros (\\"You opened my eyes to a world that I could believe.\\"...\\"The games that we're playing, they've left us hoping\\") and there are cons. (\\"When you get what you need, there's no way of knowing what you'll have is another hole to feed\\")  The real point here is that real love takes hard work and dedication, and it doesn't always turn out quite the same way we expect it to be.  It's a nice tune with a very poignant message that's rumored to become a future single.        \\"Wrong,\\" the first single taken from the album, immediately begins with a unified chanting of the title name, four times in a row, until Dave Gahan's voice explodes into the first verse (\\"I was born with the wrong sign, in the wrong house, with the wrong ascendancy\\") subjecting the listener to a torrent of negative outcries (\\"I tookthe wrong road that lead to the wrong tendencies\\") and self-deprecations (\\"There's something wrong with me chemically, something wrong with me inherently\\") that signify an essence of decay and hopelessness (\\"I was marching to the wrong drum, with the wrong scum, pissing out the wrong energy\\") yet is still able to retain that one bleak glow of hopefulness (\\"With the wrong tune played till it sounded alright, yeah!\\") that rings true. The word, \\"Wrong,\\" is actually used a total of 72 times (including backing vocals) on this original album version. It's got a fast groove with a heavy techno backbeat that'll have you singing along and dancing to your heart's content.        \\"Fragile Tension\\" is another excellent track from Sounds Of The Universe that also discusses the intricacies of relationships (\\"There's a fragile tension that's keeping us going.  It may not last forever, but oh when it's flowing\\") and the strength and power the right kind of chemistry conjures up between two people. (\\"There's a strange obsession that's drawing us nearer.  We don't understand it, it never gets clearer\\") Despite the problems and difficulties, they always seem be able to pull closer together in the end. (\\"Oh when we're teetering on the edge of collapse, nothing can keep us down\\")  The song has a strongly positive and powerful message with a great beat, a wonderful guitar performance by Martin Gore, as well as a beautiful vocal job by Dave Gahan. (\\"There's something radical in our hands, nothing logical to our plans\\") This track has \\"Hit Single\\" written all over it!        \\"Little Soul\\" is indeed a soulful little tune with an introspective, yet slightly vain, viewpoint. (\\"My little light is going to shine.  Shine out so bright and illuminate your mind.  My little soul will leave a footprint\\") The song has some nice vocal duo moments between Gahan and Gore, with a slow, quiet, and easygoing melody that, while sounding pretty, (\\"I'm channeling the universe that's focusing itself inside ofme...a singularity\\") still retains that usual DM melodic sense of melancholy. (\\"My little words are going to sting.  Haven't you heard the pain and joy they bring?\\") It's a pretty tune, which calms things down a bit.        \\"In Sympathy\\" picks things right back up again with its nicely moody up tempo sound, (\\"They're almost falling over you.  Why don't they call a truce?  Whatever they are trying to do, it's of little use\\") as Dave plays an onlooker to a beautiful and intelligent woman, whose physical attributes bring her much notice. (\\"They're drowning you in compliments, trying to furnish proof.  And though they speak with eloquence, there is little truth\\") The chorus is fraught with positive reinforcements, (\\"You're bright, you're strong, you know your right from wrong, at least to some degree.  You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough.  You smile, in sympathy\\") and coupled with the nice beat, Dave's great vocals, and Martin's alluring guitar work, it makes for a nice morality tale with some good-spirited heart and soul. (\\"And as the night begins to fade, you're heading for the door.  Followed by a sad parade; you're on your own once more\\") Longtime fans may recognize a swirling noise throughout the song that's reminiscent of a sound used prominently in the 1984 track: [[ASIN:B00004WSBM \\"People Are People,\\"]] which gives this new tune an added retro feel to it.  It's a lovely song that has the makings of another \\"Hit Single.\\"        \\"Peace,\\" the second single taken from the album, has an affirmation vibe about it, (\\"Peace will come to me\\") along with a bit of an Erasure-esque sound quality, as Dave goes through his positive mantra (\\"I'm leaving bitterness behind this time, I'm cleaning out my mind.  There is no space for the regrets I will remember to forget\\") which gives off this glowing ray of hope & happiness, (\\"I'm leaving anger in the past with all the shadows that it cast.  There is a radar in my heart I should have trusted from the start\\")something you don't usually find, on a regular basis, in a Depeche Mode album, (\\"Just look at me.  I'm a living act of holiness.  Giving all the positivity that I possess, I'm going to light up the world\\") that's nicely done.        \\"Come Back\\"* is one of those tracks that just get better, over time, with each listen.  Here we have Dave begging and pleading for that special someone to return into his life (\\"Come back.  Come back to me.  I've been waiting patiently\\") as he bares his soul (\\"Walking a thin white line between love and hate.  Wasting all of my time in another world...in another place.  I could use a little company, a little kindness can go a long way\\") and appears to be waiting in vain. (\\"Weeks turn into months, months turn into years.  Reaching the same conclusions, gathering up the fear\\") Gahan, always the hopeless romantic, evokes a personal, poetic longing and sweet sincerity, (\\"Light will always shine in the heart of you.  In truth and in reality, only blindness can hide it away\\") which gives the song its power and additional beauty.  Nicely executed by Mr. Gahan.        \\"Spacewalker\\" is a short, nearly two minute, instrumental interlude that's reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000SFJVZM \\"Easy Tiger,\\"]] from 2001's Exciter.  It has an outer-world, space age feel to it, with a moderate beat and an upbeat melody.  While the interlude ends all too briefly, it sets things up nicely for the next track on the album.        \\"Perfect,\\" again, continues the whole relationship motif of the album, this time with the idea of using other dimensions & realities to tell the story. (\\"On another world by another star, in another place in time.  In another state of consciousness, in another state of mind\\") And each reality has slightly different outcomes, (\\"Everything was almost perfect, everything fell into place.  The jury reached a different verdict, before the judge dismissed the case\\") some positive, (\\"In another lonely universe, we're laying side by side, and no one's hurt and no one's cursed and no one needs to hide\\") some negative. (\\"I didn't shoot, I didn't pull the trigger.  It wasn't me.  I'm just a plain and simple singer.  I heard the sound, I turned my head around, to watch our love shot down\\") But the true constant, no matter what reality we experience, is that people, and life in general, are never easy.  It's always a lot of hard work and dedication that make anything in this world worthwhile.  This track is already rumored to be a future single, and that's not surprising, as it's a great track and a definite highlight from \\"Sounds Of The Universe.\\"        \\"Miles Away / The Truth Is\\"* gets its odd name from the mere fact that when the band heard that Madonna already had a song out called \\"Miles Away,\\" they didn't want their song to have the exact same title, so it was altered to include \\"The Truth Is.\\"  It's a funky tune, with Dave discussing the mundane and repetitive aspects of getting to know someone (\\"It's one of those conversations we've, we've had them before.  The ones that leave you empty and wanting for more\\") and that déjà vu feeling of having done it so many times before (\\"Excuse me for my hesitation I've, I've met you before.  Your face seems so familiar and longing for more\\") you start to wonder if anyone out will ever be right for you. (\\"With all your superstitions and empty lines, I could be just like you, withdrawn but alive\\") Accepting the fact that we're not always given the things we want most in this world, (\\"Life, it has its limitations.  We all have our needs.  Love could be the only answer.  It lies underneath\\") the struggle to continue on, in the hopes of some day finding them can sometimes leave us feeling isolated. (\\"Your eyes, they tell me something that I understand.  Your eyes, they hold the truth and the truth is, your miles away\\")       \\"Jezebel\\" leads us to the only lead vocal track by Martin Gore on the album.  The song, which has an eerily dark calypso feel to it, focuses on the subject of female promiscuity, (\\"They call you Jezebel whenever we walk in.  You're going straight to hell for wanton acts of sin, they say, and that I'll have to pay.  But I need you just this way\\") and feels almost like a direct sequel to the song, \\"Lilian,\\" from \\"Playing The Angel.\\" (\\"They call you Jezebel for what you like to wear.  You're morally unwell.  They say you'll never care for me\\") But the biggest difference is perspective, whereas Dave had spoken about this topic in a much darker more objective tone, Martin's take is much more optimistic and forgiving. (\\"But what they fail to see is that your games are the key.  Open their eyes to the beauty.  Open their hearts to the fun. Open their minds to the idea that you don't own someone\\") Martin, as always, does a wonderful job with the song, and gives it an elegant flow with his beautiful vocal work.        \\"Corrupt\\" brings the album to a close with a dark and seductive take on the power struggle between men and women, (\\"I could corrupt you in a heartbeat.  You think you're so special...think you're so sweet.  What are you trying?  Don't even tempt me.  Soon you'll be crying and wishing you'd dreamt me\\") with finger pointing, (\\"You'll be calling out my name, when you need someone to blame\\") and sadomasochistic overtones galore. (\\"I could corrupt you.  It would be easy.  Watching you suffer, girl it would please me.  But I wouldn't touch you with my little finger.  I know it would crush you.  My memory would linger\\") Dave Gahan has always possessed those alluringly broody vocals of his, (\\"I could corrupt you.  It would be ugly.  They could sedate you, but what good would drugs be?\\") and they work in this song absolutely brilliantly. (\\"You'll be crying out in pain, begging me to play my games\\") It's arguably the best final track on a Depeche Mode album since \\"Clean\\" & \\"Higher Love,\\" with a nicely dark electronic tone, funky guitar riffs, and a groovy beat that ends the album perfectly.  But wait, there's an additional hidden track included later on: an instrumental version of \\"Wrong.\\"        The Deluxe Boxset edition of \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" includes a plethora of bonus content that the band personally curated in order to include as much as possible from the recording sessions.  It will make any DM fan satisfied.  The box itself is a custom made 2 piece box with foil blocking, plus an inlay, and is about the size of a small (thick) pizza box with a number of additional goodies inside that are very interesting, including:    3 CDs - Housed in Colored Cardboard Sleeves:  Disc 1 - the original album [Blue/Purple]  Disc 2 - Five B-Sides & Six Remixes [Orange/Green], including:    \\"Light\\" [4:42] - has a nice feel and flavor about it, with an additive groove (\\"It's clear we have a mission from above, a mission of beauty.  You know I wouldn't lie to you\\") that makes it a cool track and a worthy B-side.      \\"The Sun and The Moon and The Stars\\" [4:42] - Martin Gore's 2nd lead vocal track was deemed unfit for the regular album, but is still a lovely tune just the same. (\\"One subtle move, God help me, is all it takes to sell me.  One single word, unspoken, your name unheard and I'm broken\\")    \\"Ghost\\" [6:29] - showcases Dave as the ghostly spectre of your dreams, (\\"I'm the ghost in your house, calling your name.  My memory lingers, you'll never be the same.  I'm the whole in your heart; I'm the stain in your bed.  The phantom in your fingers, the voices in your head\\") which has a nice steely, seductive quality about it that really sounds great.      \\"Esque\\" [2:18] - is a haunting electronic instrumental with bells, chimes and other subtle electronic sounds.      \\"Oh Well\\" [5:59] - has a frenetic beat and urgency that pulls you right into it.  (\\"Oh, you've got a way about you.  Oh, I know so much about you, girl.  Life won't be the same without you.  Life will surely be the one to tell\\") It's a nice fast track that's fun to move to.  (\\"Listen to what she's trying to tell you.  She could be the one who's going to save you.  Oh well.\\") This song is also included as a bonus track on the Japanese CD.      \\"Corrupt (Efdemin Remix)\\" [6:28] - experimental mix that plays with phrases from the song and utilizes a weird sort of funky beat.      \\"In Chains (Minilogue's Earth Remix) [7:54] - has a bit of an erratic flavor, with a lot of different noises and echoing sounds going on as the opening first verse gets played around and distorted vocally.      \\"Little Soul (Thomas Fehlmann Ambient Mix)\\" [9:20] - gives the song a bit more kick this time, with a nice beat and some additional electronic riffs and an echo effect: \\"My little soul will leave a footprint (print) (print) (print...)\\" which is good, though the mix is long.      Jezebel (Six Toes Remix) [5:33] - is a wonderfully put together acoustic version, with a string accompaniment that really gives the song a whole different dimension and elegance that really works well.      \\"Perfect (Electronic Periodic Dark Drone Mix)\\" [5:25] - has a bit if an urban flavor to it, with a fast beat and mild distortion of the original vocals by Dave Gahan.      \\"Wrong (Caspa Remix)\\" [5:05] - is a sleeker version that almost sounds like an alternate take, with heavy drum percussion and additional electronic sounds & distortions.      Disc 3 - Fourteen Original Demo Tracks [Red/Green], including:  \\"Little 15\\" [4:15]  \\"Clean\\" [3:41]  \\"Sweetest Perfection\\" [3:24]  \\"Walking In My Shoes\\" [3:45]  \\"I Feel You\\" [4:02]  \\"Judas\\" [3:32]  \\"Surrender\\" [5:06]  \\"Only When I Lose Myself\\" [5:50]  \\"Nothing's Impossible\\" [5:05]  \\"Corrupt\\" [4:44]  \\"Peace\\" [4:36]  \\"Jezebel\\" [4:39]  \\"Come Back\\" [5:10]  \\"In Chains\\" [4:34]  (Except for \\"Nothing's Impossible\\" & \\"Come Back\\" every demo is performed by Martin Gore, and the sound quality is amazing...it's rumored that Alan Wilder provided some of the demos for this disc...Andrew Fletcher has stated that there will be more demos made available on future releases.)    The DVD [Brown/Red] includes theentire album (with B-sides) in Dolby & DTS 5.1 Surround Sound (compressed 48/24) along with the following extras:    \\"Making The Universe\\" [45:23] - a grand documentary on the making of this wonderful album, from creation to inception.    \\"Usual Thing.  Try To Get The Question In The Answer\\" [55:12] - 2nd grand documentary with more insightful stories and interviews with the band members.      \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" [a short film]: with a running time of around 10 minutes, this short but insightful film is highlighted by interviews about the album by Martin, Dave, & Andy.  It's a sneak peek into the creation process and there are some nice stories by all to be heard.       \\"Wrong Music Video\\" [3:23]: Directed by Patrick Daughters, the video portrays an unknown man (Julian Gross from American art rock legends Liars) tied and gagged inside a car that is slowly rolling backwards down a long road to his death.  The band only have a quick 5 second cameo, which is a little disappointing, but the video itself is eerily dark, bleak, and pure Depeche Mode.      Studio Session Performances of \\"Wrong,\\" \\"Corrupt,\\" \\"Little Soul,\\" \\"Stories Of Old,\\" & \\"Come Back\\" (These sound excellent!)      Also included are two 84 page hardback books; one with complete lyrics and photos by famed photographer, Anton Corbijn, the other with candid photos by Daniel Miller, Ben Hillier, Luke Smith, & Ferg Peterkin.    5 artcards (out of 14) sealed in collector's envelope with pics of all 14 on back.     2 enamel pin badges: one of the \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" cover logo, the other of the DM retro logo.      1 large poster of album cover artwork    Numbered Certificate of Authenticity with copied signatures of band members.        \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" is another great album by the best electronic band in the world.  Unlike other Deluxe Boxsets by other bands like U2, Pearl Jam, etc, this Boxset is worth every penny, with plenty of wonderful content for value and worth.  The album is a triumphand another milestone for Depeche Mode.  Pick it up and enjoy the magic of DM many times over.        \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" Deluxe Boxset: Give Into The Corruption.

B0014DBZY2|5.0|Good god!  I just happened to stumble upon this band and they are great!  This album just gets better and better.  What a pleasant surprise.
B001IBIQU6|3.0|I have to agree with the reviewers here that point out a lack of strong melody, hooks and catchiness. And btw I loved Exciter, so I don't have a problem with DM doing new things. My favorite DM disc is SOFAD, so use that as a reference if you want.    Does it just suffer from being under-baked? It seems it could have used a little more time in development to punch it up, to give it some memorableness, because as it stands its just OK.    Some say its missing the Wilder polish. Could be.    The bar was set so high by DM in the past that one can't help but feel a letdown here. And its not the same band anymore anyway.     'Wrong' is a good first single, the lyrics stand up well, though the repetitive 'chorus' (wrong) becomes a bit overbearing.   Dave's vocals are very good and the song does hold up.    Actually all of the songs are OK--but just OK. not great,not horrible.  Mid-level Mode.    That said, it is Depeche, so even a second tier effort is worth a purchase.     And do yourself a favor--listen to it w/ headphones. It def improves the experience.    Would give it 3 1/2 stars if that were possible. But 4, no.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a very well produced film on the life of John Adams. Most stories about our revolution center on the battles fought. This centers on the political strugles that went on to support the fight for freedom. The acting is fantastic! The scenes make you feel like it was filmed in Boston and Philly in 1775.
B001RTP48G|5.0|25 years into their career, the Pet Shop Boys release their best album .  A mix between \\"Very\\" and their classic 80s hits, \\"Yes\\" is filled with upbeat, pop, dance tracks with clever lyrics. Nearly every song on the album could be a single.    I was blown away when I first heard this album... it's so good!    Great Job!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I've discovered Madeleine Peyroux by chance- CD was a gift to soft jazz lover and I must say, it's a great one!<br />This Canadian singer has very unusually sweet yet &#34;throat&#34; voice, which is quite sexy. Way she pitches notes and carries melody, makes it pleasantly surprising and jazzy.<br /><br />Songs are being performed in english and french. Many of them were futured in the movies. CD on romantic side, can make great Valentine GIFT.
B001TCAT9U|5.0|After three years of waiting, Depeche Mode are back with their 12th original studio release, the epically grand titled: [[ASIN:B001TCAT9U \\"Sounds Of The Universe.\\"]]  The band came up with the name quite early on in the process. Songwriter, Martin Gore, has said that the title just felt like it summed up the eclectic nature of the songs and the sounds on the album.  While he feels there is no overall theme, the album tends to focus on different aspects of relationships, both positive and negative.  This is a lighter, more laid back `Mode, with the album a cross between 2001s [[ASIN:B00005BL2A \\"Exciter\\"]] and 2005s [[ASIN:B000B2YQX4 \\"Playing The Angel\\"]] with a little [[ASIN:B000002LK1 \\"Violator\\"]] thrown in for good measure.  In fact, while this isn't DM at their darkest, there are very noticeable moments of darkness on the album, as well as a retro feel.  This is due in part to the fact that, during the recording sessions, Martin would constantly be winning auctions on eBay for classic older electronic equipment, incorporating them into the productions.  As with \\"Playing The Angel,\\" Martin wrote most of the songs on \\"Sounds Of The Universe,\\" with lead singer, Dave Gahan, providing writing credits for three songs (*).        \\"In Chains\\" starts things off with a one minute intro, reminiscent of how a live orchestra sounds like when they're tuning up their instruments.  Only here it's a bunch of electronic equipment that's preparing to play a piece of music, with lots of strange noises and other odd sounds going off one after the other, until all is in readiness.  Then what sounds like an electric organ begins to play the main melody, which almost sounds like something you might hear during a funeral procession.  Until Dave Gahan's voice comes crying out with sexy allure, proclaiming his adulation for the seductive power of the woman he desires, (\\"The way you move, has got me yearning.  The way you move, has left me burning.  I know you know what you're doing to me.I know my hands will never be free.  I know what it's like to be in chains\\") and the way she controls him (\\"I know I crumble when you are around.  Stutter, mumble, a pitiful sound.  Stagger, stumble, shackled and bound, in chains\\") with her sexual powers of persuasion (\\"You've got me dying for you.  It's you that I'm living through.  You've got me praying to you, saying to you anything you want me to...You've got me reaching for you.  My soul's beseeching me to.  You've got me singing to you, bringing to you anything you ask me to\\") that always wins over in the end.  Martin Gore adds a funky guitar riff throughout the song that gives it a bit more bite, along with his affective backing vocalizations that are always a crowd pleaser.        \\"Hole To Feed,\\"* which sounds more like a Nine Inch Nails title, opens with a cool little beat and an array of retro electric laser beam sounds, as it's formatted interestingly in a chorus-verse-chorus motif.  The song centers on the maintaining of a serious and meaningful relationship. (\\"We are here, we can love. We share something.  I'm sure that you mean the world to me.\\") But with all relationships, there are pros (\\"You opened my eyes to a world that I could believe.\\"...\\"The games that we're playing, they've left us hoping\\") and there are cons. (\\"When you get what you need, there's no way of knowing what you'll have is another hole to feed\\")  The real point here is that real love takes hard work and dedication, and it doesn't always turn out quite the same way we expect it to be.  It's a nice tune with a very poignant message that's rumored to become a future single.        \\"Wrong,\\" the first single taken from the album, immediately begins with a unified chanting of the title name, four times in a row, until Dave Gahan's voice explodes into the first verse (\\"I was born with the wrong sign, in the wrong house, with the wrong ascendancy\\") subjecting the listener to a torrent of negative outcries (\\"I took the wrong road that leadto the wrong tendencies\\") and self-deprecations (\\"There's something wrong with me chemically, something wrong with me inherently\\") that signify an essence of decay and hopelessness (\\"I was marching to the wrong drum, with the wrong scum, pissing out the wrong energy\\") yet is still able to retain that one bleak glow of hopefulness (\\"With the wrong tune played till it sounded alright, yeah!\\") that rings true. The word, \\"Wrong,\\" is actually used a total of 72 times (including backing vocals) on this original album version. It's got a fast groove with a heavy techno backbeat that'll have you singing along and dancing to your heart's content.        \\"Fragile Tension\\" is another excellent track from Sounds Of The Universe that also discusses the intricacies of relationships (\\"There's a fragile tension that's keeping us going.  It may not last forever, but oh when it's flowing\\") and the strength and power the right kind of chemistry conjures up between two people. (\\"There's a strange obsession that's drawing us nearer.  We don't understand it, it never gets clearer\\") Despite the problems and difficulties, they always seem be able to pull closer together in the end. (\\"Oh when we're teetering on the edge of collapse, nothing can keep us down\\")  The song has a strongly positive and powerful message with a great beat, a wonderful guitar performance by Martin Gore, as well as a beautiful vocal job by Dave Gahan. (\\"There's something radical in our hands, nothing logical to our plans\\") This track has \\"Hit Single\\" written all over it!        \\"Little Soul\\" is indeed a soulful little tune with an introspective, yet slightly vain, viewpoint. (\\"My little light is going to shine.  Shine out so bright and illuminate your mind.  My little soul will leave a footprint\\") The song has some nice vocal duo moments between Gahan and Gore, with a slow, quiet, and easygoing melody that, while sounding pretty, (\\"I'm channeling the universe that's focusing itself inside of me...a singularity\\") still retains that usual DM melodic sense of melancholy. (\\"My little words are going to sting.  Haven't you heard the pain and joy they bring?\\") It's a pretty tune, which calms things down a bit.        \\"In Sympathy\\" picks things right back up again with its nicely moody up tempo sound, (\\"They're almost falling over you.  Why don't they call a truce?  Whatever they are trying to do, it's of little use\\") as Dave plays an onlooker to a beautiful and intelligent woman, whose physical attributes bring her much notice. (\\"They're drowning you in compliments, trying to furnish proof.  And though they speak with eloquence, there is little truth\\") The chorus is fraught with positive reinforcements, (\\"You're bright, you're strong, you know your right from wrong, at least to some degree.  You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough.  You smile, in sympathy\\") and coupled with the nice beat, Dave's great vocals, and Martin's alluring guitar work, it makes for a nice morality tale with some good-spirited heart and soul. (\\"And as the night begins to fade, you're heading for the door.  Followed by a sad parade; you're on your own once more\\") Longtime fans may recognize a swirling noise throughout the song that's reminiscent of a sound used prominently in the 1984 track: [[ASIN:B00004WSBM \\"People Are People,\\"]] which gives this new tune an added retro feel to it.  It's a lovely song that has the makings of another \\"Hit Single.\\"        \\"Peace,\\" the second single taken from the album, has an affirmation vibe about it, (\\"Peace will come to me\\") along with a bit of an Erasure-esque sound quality, as Dave goes through his positive mantra (\\"I'm leaving bitterness behind this time, I'm cleaning out my mind.  There is no space for the regrets I will remember to forget\\") which gives off this glowing ray of hope & happiness, (\\"I'm leaving anger in the past with all the shadows that it cast.  There is a radar in my heart I should have trusted from the start\\") something you don't usually find, on a regular basis, in a Depeche Mode album, (\\"Just look at me.  I'm a living act of holiness.  Giving all the positivity that I possess, I'm going to light up the world\\") that's nicely done.        \\"Come Back\\"* is one of those tracks that just get better, over time, with each listen.  Here we have Dave begging and pleading for that special someone to return into his life (\\"Come back.  Come back to me.  I've been waiting patiently\\") as he bares his soul (\\"Walking a thin white line between love and hate.  Wasting all of my time in another world...in another place.  I could use a little company, a little kindness can go a long way\\") and appears to be waiting in vain. (\\"Weeks turn into months, months turn into years.  Reaching the same conclusions, gathering up the fear\\") Gahan, always the hopeless romantic, evokes a personal, poetic longing and sweet sincerity, (\\"Light will always shine in the heart of you.  In truth and in reality, only blindness can hide it away\\") which gives the song its power and additional beauty.  Nicely executed by Mr. Gahan.        \\"Spacewalker\\" is a short, nearly two minute, instrumental interlude that's reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000SFJVZM \\"Easy Tiger,\\"]] from 2001's Exciter.  It has an outer-world, space age feel to it, with a moderate beat and an upbeat melody.  While the interlude ends all too briefly, it sets things up nicely for the next track on the album.        \\"Perfect,\\" again, continues the whole relationship motif of the album, this time with the idea of using other dimensions & realities to tell the story. (\\"On another world by another star, in another place in time.  In another state of consciousness, in another state of mind\\") And each reality has slightly different outcomes, (\\"Everything was almost perfect, everything fell into place.  The jury reached a different verdict, before the judge dismissed the case\\") some positive, (\\"In another lonely universe, we're laying side by side, and no one's hurt and no one's cursed and no one needs to hide\\") some negative. (\\"I didn't shoot, I didn't pull the trigger.  It wasn't me.  I'm just a plain and simple singer.  I heard the sound, I turned my head around, to watch our love shot down\\") But the true constant, no matter what reality we experience, is that people, and life in general, are never easy.  It's always a lot of hard work and dedication that make anything in this world worthwhile.  This track is already rumored to be a future single, and that's not surprising, as it's a great track and a definite highlight from \\"Sounds Of The Universe.\\"        \\"Miles Away / The Truth Is\\"* gets its odd name from the mere fact that when the band heard that Madonna already had a song out called \\"Miles Away,\\" they didn't want their song to have the exact same title, so it was altered to include \\"The Truth Is.\\"  It's a funky tune, with Dave discussing the mundane and repetitive aspects of getting to know someone (\\"It's one of those conversations we've, we've had them before.  The ones that leave you empty and wanting for more\\") and that déjà vu feeling of having done it so many times before (\\"Excuse me for my hesitation I've, I've met you before.  Your face seems so familiar and longing for more\\") you start to wonder if anyone out will ever be right for you. (\\"With all your superstitions and empty lines, I could be just like you, withdrawn but alive\\") Accepting the fact that we're not always given the things we want most in this world, (\\"Life, it has its limitations.  We all have our needs.  Love could be the only answer.  It lies underneath\\") the struggle to continue on, in the hopes of some day finding them can sometimes leave us feeling isolated. (\\"Your eyes, they tell me something that I understand.  Your eyes, they hold the truth and the truth is, your miles away\\")       \\"Jezebel\\" leads us to the only lead vocal track by Martin Gore on the album.  The song, which has an eerily dark calypso feel to it, focuses on the subject of female promiscuity,(\\"They call you Jezebel whenever we walk in.  You're going straight to hell for wanton acts of sin, they say, and that I'll have to pay.  But I need you just this way\\") and feels almost like a direct sequel to the song, \\"Lilian,\\" from \\"Playing The Angel.\\" (\\"They call you Jezebel for what you like to wear.  You're morally unwell.  They say you'll never care for me\\") But the biggest difference is perspective, whereas Dave had spoken about this topic in a much darker more objective tone, Martin's take is much more optimistic and forgiving. (\\"But what they fail to see is that your games are the key.  Open their eyes to the beauty.  Open their hearts to the fun. Open their minds to the idea that you don't own someone\\") Martin, as always, does a wonderful job with the song, and gives it an elegant flow with his beautiful vocal work.        \\"Corrupt\\" brings the album to a close with a dark and seductive take on the power struggle between men and women, (\\"I could corrupt you in a heartbeat.  You think you're so special...think you're so sweet.  What are you trying?  Don't even tempt me.  Soon you'll be crying and wishing you'd dreamt me\\") with finger pointing, (\\"You'll be calling out my name, when you need someone to blame\\") and sadomasochistic overtones galore. (\\"I could corrupt you.  It would be easy.  Watching you suffer, girl it would please me.  But I wouldn't touch you with my little finger.  I know it would crush you.  My memory would linger\\") Dave Gahan has always possessed those alluringly broody vocals of his, (\\"I could corrupt you.  It would be ugly.  They could sedate you, but what good would drugs be?\\") and they work in this song absolutely brilliantly. (\\"You'll be crying out in pain, begging me to play my games\\") It's arguably the best final track on a Depeche Mode album since \\"Clean\\" & \\"Higher Love,\\" with a nicely dark electronic tone, funky guitar riffs, and a groovy beat that ends the album perfectly.  But wait, there's an additional hidden track included later on: an instrumental version of \\"Wrong.\\"        The Bonus DVD included with this edition has some additional goodies that are interesting, including:     The entire album in Dolby & DTS 5.1 Surround Sound (compressed 48/24).      \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" [a short film]: with a running time of around 10 minutes, this short but insightful film is highlighted by interviews about the album by Martin, Dave, & Andy.  It's a sneak peek into the creation process and there are some nice stories by all to be heard.       \\"Wrong Music Video\\" [3:23]: Directed by Patrick Daughters, the video portrays an unknown man (Julian Gross from American art rock legends Liars) tied and gagged inside a car that is slowly rolling backwards down a long road to his death.  The band only have a quick 5 second cameo, which is a little disappointing, but the video itself is eerily dark, bleak, and pure Depeche Mode.      In Chains (Minilogue's Earth Remix) [7:54] - has a bit of an erratic flavor, with a lot of different noises and echoing sounds going on as the opening first verse gets played around and distorted vocally.      Little Soul (Thomas Fehlmann Ambient Mix) [9:20] - gives the song a bit more kick this time, with a nice beat and some additional electronic riffs and an echo effect: \\"My little soul will leave a footprint (print) (print) (print...)\\" which is good, though the mix is long.      Jezebel (Six Toes Remix) [5:33] - is a wonderfully put together acoustic version, with a string accompaniment that really gives the song a whole different dimension and elegance that really works well.        \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" is another great album by the best electronic band in the world.  If there were anything to criticize it would be the fact that only one Martin Gore lead vocal track was used instead of two.  Martin actually wrote and performed a second track, entitled: \\"The Sun and The Moon and The Stars,\\" which is another beautifully made music number.  But the band felt that it just didn't fit well with the rest of the album, so it was dropped.  It's included, along with 4 other non-album tracks on disc two of the \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" Deluxe Edition.  Even so, the album is a triumph and another milestone for Depeche Mode.  Pick it up and enjoy.        \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\": Give Into The Corruption.

B001IBIQU6|4.0|I am sure that there are tons of Depeche Mode fans out there who are still unhappy that DM's albums after Violator were not so terrific. The problem really is that in the late eighties, freestyle dance music was on it's way out. However to give it a grand exit, radio stations in the United States played bands synthpop bands like Information Society, and The Pet Shop Boys non stop. Maybe it was because club DJ's added them to their own playlists. Depeche Mode was a club favorite thanks to songs like Strangelove. Violator was their apex. Almost half of the album was on the charts.     This album I think is a step back into DM's past. It's better than Angel, and to be fair, \\"Peace\\" is a better song than \\"Wrong\\". \\"Wrong\\" is radio friendly and that is why it was their first single. Honestly, I did not like \\"Wrong\\" when it first came out, but the song grew on me.     This album shows that Dave Gahan has improved his writing skills, and of course Martin Gore of course is a master at his craft.    Love it, hate it, move to it, feel it.

B001IBIQU6|2.0|Gone are the multi-layered, textured, sophisticated songs of Music of the Masses and Violator.  The new songs on Sounds of the Universe are very basic, not a lot going on. They haven't progressed much from demo form. Some are decent, but I had high hopes since their last album Playing the Angel was a comeback of sorts since Alan Wilder left. You can hear the void that is missing in these songs that Wilder would have filled adding much more complexity to them.     I do like the bonus tracks Ghost, Oh Well    Good Album songs: Little Soul, Wrong, Corrupt, Peace    Overall a disappointement... Oh Well!
B001TOD92C|5.0|This movie should have won an Oscar for Mickey Rourke. He deserved it. His performance here is stunning and Marissa Tomei is equally stunning in what they bring to their roles. You aren't seeing actors...you are seeing real people.    Get it folks. It's a winner.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|After three years of waiting, Depeche Mode are back with their 12th original studio release, the epically grand titled: [[ASIN:B001IBIQU6 \\"Sounds Of The Universe.\\"]]  The band came up with the name quite early on in the process. Songwriter, Martin Gore, has said that the title just felt like it summed up the eclectic nature of the songs and the sounds on the album.  While he feels there is no overall theme, the album tends to focus on different aspects of relationships, both positive and negative.  This is a lighter, more laid back `Mode, with the album a cross between 2001s [[ASIN:B00005BL2A \\"Exciter\\"]] and 2005s [[ASIN:B000B2YQX4 \\"Playing The Angel\\"]] with a little [[ASIN:B000002LK1 \\"Violator\\"]] thrown in for good measure.  In fact, while this isn't DM at their darkest, there are very noticeable moments of darkness on the album, as well as a retro feel.  This is due in part to the fact that, during the recording sessions, Martin would constantly be winning auctions on eBay for classic older electronic equipment, incorporating them into the productions.  As with \\"Playing The Angel,\\" Martin wrote most of the songs on \\"Sounds Of The Universe,\\" with lead singer, Dave Gahan, providing writing credits for three songs (*).        \\"In Chains\\" starts things off with a one minute intro, reminiscent of how a live orchestra sounds like when they're tuning up their instruments.  Only here it's a bunch of electronic equipment that's preparing to play a piece of music, with lots of strange noises and other odd sounds going off one after the other, until all is in readiness.  Then what sounds like an electric organ begins to play the main melody, which almost sounds like something you might hear during a funeral procession.  Until Dave Gahan's voice comes crying out with sexy allure, proclaiming his adulation for the seductive power of the woman he desires, (\\"The way you move, has got me yearning.  The way you move, has left me burning.  I know you know what you're doing to me.I know my hands will never be free.  I know what it's like to be in chains\\") and the way she controls him (\\"I know I crumble when you are around.  Stutter, mumble, a pitiful sound.  Stagger, stumble, shackled and bound, in chains\\") with her sexual powers of persuasion (\\"You've got me dying for you.  It's you that I'm living through.  You've got me praying to you, saying to you anything you want me to...You've got me reaching for you.  My soul's beseeching me to.  You've got me singing to you, bringing to you anything you ask me to\\") that always wins over in the end.  Martin Gore adds a funky guitar riff throughout the song that gives it a bit more bite, along with his affective backing vocalizations that are always a crowd pleaser.        \\"Hole To Feed,\\"* which sounds more like a Nine Inch Nails title, opens with a cool little beat and an array of retro electric laser beam sounds, as it's formatted interestingly in a chorus-verse-chorus motif.  The song centers on the maintaining of a serious and meaningful relationship. (\\"We are here, we can love. We share something.  I'm sure that you mean the world to me.\\") But with all relationships, there are pros (\\"You opened my eyes to a world that I could believe.\\"...\\"The games that we're playing, they've left us hoping\\") and there are cons. (\\"When you get what you need, there's no way of knowing what you'll have is another hole to feed\\")  The real point here is that real love takes hard work and dedication, and it doesn't always turn out quite the same way we expect it to be.  It's a nice tune with a very poignant message that's rumored to become a future single.        \\"Wrong,\\" the first single taken from the album, immediately begins with a unified chanting of the title name, four times in a row, until Dave Gahan's voice explodes into the first verse (\\"I was born with the wrong sign, in the wrong house, with the wrong ascendancy\\") subjecting the listener to a torrent of negative outcries (\\"I took the wrong road that leadto the wrong tendencies\\") and self-deprecations (\\"There's something wrong with me chemically, something wrong with me inherently\\") that signify an essence of decay and hopelessness (\\"I was marching to the wrong drum, with the wrong scum, pissing out the wrong energy\\") yet is still able to retain that one bleak glow of hopefulness (\\"With the wrong tune played till it sounded alright, yeah!\\") that rings true. The word, \\"Wrong,\\" is actually used a total of 72 times (including backing vocals) on this original album version. It's got a fast groove with a heavy techno backbeat that'll have you singing along and dancing to your heart's content.  A music video, directed by Patrick Daughters, was released; portraying an unknown man (Julian Gross from American art rock legends Liars) tied and gagged inside a car that is slowly rolling backwards down a long road to his death.  The band only have a quick 5 second cameo, which is a little disappointing, but the video itself is eerily dark, bleak, and pure Depeche Mode.        \\"Fragile Tension\\" is another excellent track from Sounds Of The Universe that also discusses the intricacies of relationships (\\"There's a fragile tension that's keeping us going.  It may not last forever, but oh when it's flowing\\") and the strength and power the right kind of chemistry conjures up between two people. (\\"There's a strange obsession that's drawing us nearer.  We don't understand it, it never gets clearer\\") Despite the problems and difficulties, they always seem be able to pull closer together in the end. (\\"Oh when we're teetering on the edge of collapse, nothing can keep us down\\")  The song has a strongly positive and powerful message with a great beat, a wonderful guitar performance by Martin Gore, as well as a beautiful vocal job by Dave Gahan. (\\"There's something radical in our hands, nothing logical to our plans\\") This track has \\"Hit Single\\" written all over it!        \\"Little Soul\\" is indeed a soulful little tune with an introspective, yet slightly vain, viewpoint. (\\"My little light is going to shine.  Shine out so bright and illuminate your mind.  My little soul will leave a footprint\\") The song has some nice vocal duo moments between Gahan and Gore, with a slow, quiet, and easygoing melody that, while sounding pretty, (\\"I'm channeling the universe that's focusing itself inside of me...a singularity\\") still retains that usual DM melodic sense of melancholy. (\\"My little words are going to sting.  Haven't you heard the pain and joy they bring?\\") It's a pretty tune, which calms things down a bit.        \\"In Sympathy\\" picks things right back up again with its nicely moody up tempo sound, (\\"They're almost falling over you.  Why don't they call a truce?  Whatever they are trying to do, it's of little use\\") as Dave plays an onlooker to a beautiful and intelligent woman, whose physical attributes bring her much notice. (\\"They're drowning you in compliments, trying to furnish proof.  And though they speak with eloquence, there is little truth\\") The chorus is fraught with positive reinforcements, (\\"You're bright, you're strong, you know your right from wrong, at least to some degree.  You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough.  You smile, in sympathy\\") and coupled with the nice beat, Dave's great vocals, and Martin's alluring guitar work, it makes for a nice morality tale with some good-spirited heart and soul. (\\"And as the night begins to fade, you're heading for the door.  Followed by a sad parade; you're on your own once more\\") Longtime fans may recognize a swirling noise throughout the song that's reminiscent of a sound used prominently in the 1984 track: [[ASIN:B00004WSBM \\"People Are People,\\"]] which gives this new tune an added retro feel to it.  It's a lovely song that has the makings of another \\"Hit Single.\\"        \\"Peace,\\" the second single taken from the album, has an affirmation vibe about it, (\\"Peace will come to me\\") along with a bit of an Erasure-esque sound quality, as Dave goes through his positive mantra (\\"I'm leaving bitterness behind this time, I'm cleaning out my mind.  There is no space for the regrets I will remember to forget\\") which gives off this glowing ray of hope & happiness, (\\"I'm leaving anger in the past with all the shadows that it cast.  There is a radar in my heart I should have trusted from the start\\") something you don't usually find, on a regular basis, in a Depeche Mode album, (\\"Just look at me.  I'm a living act of holiness.  Giving all the positivity that I possess, I'm going to light up the world\\") that's nicely done.        \\"Come Back\\"* is one of those tracks that just get better, over time, with each listen.  Here we have Dave begging and pleading for that special someone to return into his life (\\"Come back.  Come back to me.  I've been waiting patiently\\") as he bares his soul (\\"Walking a thin white line between love and hate.  Wasting all of my time in another world...in another place.  I could use a little company, a little kindness can go a long way\\") and appears to be waiting in vain. (\\"Weeks turn into months, months turn into years.  Reaching the same conclusions, gathering up the fear\\") Gahan, always the hopeless romantic, evokes a personal, poetic longing and sweet sincerity, (\\"Light will always shine in the heart of you.  In truth and in reality, only blindness can hide it away\\") which gives the song its power and additional beauty.  Nicely executed by Mr. Gahan.        \\"Spacewalker\\" is a short, nearly two minute, instrumental interlude that's reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000SFJVZM \\"Easy Tiger,\\"]] from 2001's Exciter.  It has an outer-world, space age feel to it, with a moderate beat and an upbeat melody.  While the interlude ends all too briefly, it sets things up nicely for the next track on the album.        \\"Perfect,\\" again, continues the whole relationship motif of the album, this time with the idea of using other dimensions & realities to tell the story. (\\"On another world by another star, in another place in time.  In another state of consciousness, in another state of mind\\") And each reality has slightly different outcomes, (\\"Everything was almost perfect, everything fell into place.  The jury reached a different verdict, before the judge dismissed the case\\") some positive, (\\"In another lonely universe, we're laying side by side, and no one's hurt and no one's cursed and no one needs to hide\\") some negative. (\\"I didn't shoot, I didn't pull the trigger.  It wasn't me.  I'm just a plain and simple singer.  I heard the sound, I turned my head around, to watch our love shot down\\") But the true constant, no matter what reality we experience, is that people, and life in general, are never easy.  It's always a lot of hard work and dedication that make anything in this world worthwhile.  This track is already rumored to be a future single, and that's not surprising, as it's a great track and a definite highlight from \\"Sounds Of The Universe.\\"        \\"Miles Away / The Truth Is\\"* gets its odd name from the mere fact that when the band heard that Madonna already had a song out called \\"Miles Away,\\" they didn't want their song to have the exact same title, so it was altered to include \\"The Truth Is.\\"  It's a funky tune, with Dave discussing the mundane and repetitive aspects of getting to know someone (\\"It's one of those conversations we've, we've had them before.  The ones that leave you empty and wanting for more\\") and that déjà vu feeling of having done it so many times before (\\"Excuse me for my hesitation I've, I've met you before.  Your face seems so familiar and longing for more\\") you start to wonder if anyone out will ever be right for you. (\\"With all your superstitions and empty lines, I could be just like you, withdrawn but alive\\") Accepting the fact that we're not always given the things we want most in this world, (\\"Life, it has its limitations.  We all have our needs.  Love could be the only answer.  It lies underneath\\") the struggle to continue on, in the hopes of some day finding them can sometimes leave us feeling isolated. (\\"Your eyes, they tell me something that I understand.  Your eyes, they hold the truth and the truth is, your miles away\\")       \\"Jezebel\\" leads us to the only lead vocal track by Martin Gore on the album.  The song, which has an eerily dark calypso feel to it, focuses on the subject of female promiscuity, (\\"They call you Jezebel whenever we walk in.  You're going straight to hell for wanton acts of sin, they say, and that I'll have to pay.  But I need you just this way\\") and feels almost like a direct sequel to the song, \\"Lilian,\\" from \\"Playing The Angel.\\" (\\"They call you Jezebel for what you like to wear.  You're morally unwell.  They say you'll never care for me\\") But the biggest difference is perspective, whereas Dave had spoken about this topic in a much darker more objective tone, Martin's take is much more optimistic and forgiving. (\\"But what they fail to see is that your games are the key.  Open their eyes to the beauty.  Open their hearts to the fun. Open their minds to the idea that you don't own someone\\") Martin, as always, does a wonderful job with the song, and gives it an elegant flow with his beautiful vocal work.        \\"Corrupt\\" brings the album to a close with a dark and seductive take on the power struggle between men and women, (\\"I could corrupt you in a heartbeat.  You think you're so special...think you're so sweet.  What are you trying?  Don't even tempt me.  Soon you'll be crying and wishing you'd dreamt me\\") with finger pointing, (\\"You'll be calling out my name, when you need someone to blame\\") and sadomasochistic overtones galore. (\\"I could corrupt you.  It would be easy.  Watching you suffer, girl it would please me.  But I wouldn't touch you with my little finger.  I know it would crush you.  My memory would linger\\") Dave Gahan has always possessed those alluringly broody vocals of his, (\\"I could corrupt you.  It would be ugly.  They could sedate you, but what good woulddrugs be?\\") and they work in this song absolutely brilliantly. (\\"You'll be crying out in pain, begging me to play my games\\") It's arguably the best final track on a Depeche Mode album since \\"Clean\\" & \\"Higher Love,\\" with a nicely dark electronic tone, funky guitar riffs, and a groovy beat that ends the album perfectly.  But wait, there's an additional hidden track included later on: an instrumental version of \\"Wrong.\\"        \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" is another great album by the best electronic band in the world.  If there were anything to criticize it would be the fact that only one Martin Gore lead vocal track was used instead of two.  Martin actually wrote and performed a second track, entitled: \\"The Sun and The Moon and The Stars,\\" which is another beautifully made music number.  But the band felt that it just didn't fit well with the rest of the album, so it was dropped.  It's included, along with 4 other non-album tracks on disc two of the \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" Deluxe Edition.  Even so, the album is a triumph and another milestone for Depeche Mode.  Pick it up and enjoy.        \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\": Give Into The Corruption.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|It is a movie you will not forget. Almost perfection. The acting is sheer brilliance. Now I will checkout out the directors discography. soul piercing! I went through Catholic school for 8 years and this really tantalizes my memory of that.
B00005JLEU|5.0|You don't have to love anime to appreciate this film, but it helps! I consider myself a picky anime lover; not all will do but a few will blow me away, and this is one of those few. Spirited Away has a great overall moral to it's story: growing up and becoming selfless. In the beginning, our protagonist, Chiyo, is your typical teen. But when forces beyond her control leave her to fight to save her parents, she surprisingly steps up to bat. With each trial and tribulation, Chiyo discovers that perhaps there are more important things in life, a bigger picture if you will. Now, this is done in Miyazaki's crazy way of storytelling, but if you're open culturally, this film's for you.
B001JNND9W|4.0|This film shooted in 1971 had an excellent video transcription to blu-ray. Greate scenes on the road, a simbolic story, and that is all. You must see to compare with films shooted today and sometimes has a bad video quality.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|Having seen and enjoyed both the original and the subsequent director's cut, I can appreciate why both have their fans.  The longer director's cut fleshes out much that was left unspoken in the original, most significantly, it explains the mystery of what happened to Elena, the great love of the main character's, Salvatore, life.  For those who chafe at ambiguity and/or savor as much detail as they can get, the new edition will satisfy all of your desires.  But make no mistake, it creates a profoundly different residual feeling, knowing how everything turns out.      Personally, I have a fairly strong preference for the original version precisely because of its uncertainty.  Not knowing what happened with this central theme of the story lends a certain poignant authenticity: how often in life do we really know all of the background and details behind a tragedy?  The very mystery and incomprehensibility of a particular turn of fate is an important part of what makes it so heart-wrenching; if we rationally knew and understood everything that transpired in our lives, it would be far easier to accept an adverse turn of events.  We would no doubt still be disappointed, but endowed with the clear-eyed recognition of the circumstances and necessity of the development, it becomes comprehensible and therefore more palatable.  There's no longer any need to engage in anguished soul-searching, vainly attempting to fathom the mystery, to determine whether your own conduct in some way contributed to the unhappy outcome, to understand how something so sorrowful could come to pass, to make peace with the sort of world in which such cruel events take place.  That's a much more intense emotional experience than simply resigning one's self fatalistically to an unfortunate but understood circumstance.    Moreover, because Elena's fate remains shrouded in the original, it allows the viewer to better imagine him/herself in Salvatore's predicament.  Did Elena disappear because the extentof her feelings was not as great as Salvatore supposed?  Did she die tragically?  Did her family disapprove and forcibly prevent her from continuing her relationship with Salvatore?  Did she meet someone else who meant more to her?  Did she receive flawed information about Salvatore that somehow dissuaded her from returning to him?  In the original release, it could be any of these, all of these, or none of these, you simply don't know.  Again, not knowing allows virtually anyone to close their eyes and imagine themselves in that position and achieve genuine empathy.  The connection between the viewer and the main character is therefore much more intimate and powerful, albeit painfully so.    By explaining everything in detail, the new director's cut eliminates all of the mystery and uncertainty.  The specific circumstances are laid out in detail, and they're fairly unique circumstances, so you cease to be able to plausibly envision yourself in a similar situation.  Every question is rationally answered, so there's no longer anything to lie awake at night wondering about.    Depending upon your personality type and how much patience you have for not knowing, the original version may be simply exasperating and you will therefore relish the certainty provided by the new director's cut.  If you are the sort of person who longs to lose yourself in a story and identify intimately with its characters, then there is much to be said in favor of the original release.  Happily, the two disc deluxe set gives you both versions, so you can choose for yourself which you prefer, and both are excellent and have their strengths.  Just be sure to watch the original first, so that you can experience not knowing all of the details before having them all laid bare for you in the director's cut.
031606792X|5.0|I loved Breaking Dawn. It pulled the Twilight series of books together. For all the people who did not like it try reading the Cast books on vampires in Tulsa. Within the first 2-3 chapters in the first book you have the f word keep going a few more chapters then they talk about bj's and keep going you have a sex scene with a underage girl and a older vampire guy who aren't married. So back off people who are slamming Breaking Dawn. If you really read into it you find true love, strong family bond, no abortions, true friendship. Something that is all lacking in our society. Stephanie Meyer's nailed it on the head. Read it again and get you mind out of the gutter.

B000ZLFALI|2.0|So, i finally watched this movie a week or so ago with my wife. I had been wanting to see it for quite a while as i heard wonderful praise from all of my friends and the reviewers. Now, i've come to the point where i have processed and thought more about what i saw. Here is the deal, i am a huge movie buff, musical theater buff, beatles fan, love julie taymor's previous works, etc. This movie, at the turn of each plot change, did not work. The cinematography is wonderful, musical arrangements pretty solid, decent singing, etc. However, the plot seemed almost non-existent; everytime another part of the story began there was yet another seperation making me not care about the characters. i think the best way to sum up my perception of this movie is that it's a lot of \\"moments\\". there were many wonderful moments in the movie, but nothing to sentimentaly tie them together for me. I really did want to like this movie. It's worth giving it a shot, but definitely over hyped.
B001UW58YU|3.0|I rated CD/DVD version 1 star because I thought it's just another Live at the Greek, I just hope this Blu-ray version could add some video surprise to the boring concert  If must turn to Blu-ray, I will choose Josh's in Concert, it's millions times better than Awake live and Live at the Greek, but I thought it's just no chance
B00260HH3K|1.0|Wow. This movie was really, really bad. Don't waste your money on it.    I'll start off by saying that after the brief battle with Grandpa Gohan, Goku whines about not being popular. Goku does not want to be taught to be able to fight. He just wants to be taught to be like everyone else and he specifically asks to be taught \\"how to get the girl\\". There is a lengthy bunch of school scenes filled with Goku being called Geeko by bullies and a silly daydream about Chi Chi eating strawberries before the ever-so-cliche interruption of the teacher getting Goku to say something that sounds stupid to embarrass him in front of the class.    Remember all the hype from James Marsters talking about how deep Piccolo's character will be? Well it turns out he's barely ever in the movie for more than a couple of random one-minute segments that are supposed to build up to the ending...Wong totally fails at this as he could have used this time to explain Piccolo's motivations. Instead he shows Piccolo taking a Dragon Ball in a lake and he and Mai killing about two people. He also takes the time to tell that he was trapped in a jar by the Mafuba for 2000 years. Roshi 'helped' with the story explaining that Piccolo invaded Earth with Oozaru 2000 years ago. Why? Is it because he's the evil half of a Namek? No. In this movie, that good half (Kami) does not exist. Piccolo is just an alien who randomly appeared on Earth and for no reason wants to destroy and then rule it. But who would there be to rule? Mai, I guess.    Speaking of which. Mai's character is not developed either aside from her walking into a poor village with a woman and a girl that has the same hair style as Mai. They all speak Japanese (including Mai) in this scene. Nothing else is hinted at in this scene for Mai's origins. But you don't really ever end up caring anyway.    Wong then takes the time to show more of how this iteration of Goku is the complete opposite of the one we all know of in the manga/anime. Goku shows off to Chi Chi by blasting open her locker when it gets stuck and suddenly Chi Chi becomes attracted to him? Why? Because he can use ki I guess.    Wong again shows another opposite of what Goku should be by having Goku sneak out of his house to show off to Chi Chi at her party. Let's not forget to mention that Goku is skipping out on his birthday celebration with his grandfather and a big delicious, meal that includes cake. Hmm...I seem to recall Goku marrying Chi Chi in the manga/anime because he thought marriage was a type of food. I guess Wong decided to throw out that part of Goku's character as well.    So now Goku makes Chi Chi even more attracted to him by getting into a fight with Fuller and his goons and subsequently making them miss him and hit each other Why did Goku never swing at them once before or even in this fight? Because he is not allowed to fight. No reason is given here either other than it was flagrantly ripped off the Superman movie. Goku reveals to Chi Chi he knows nothing about his past or parents but that his grandfather would tell him. So he's been waiting all his life to find out who he is and on the day he is supposed to find out, he runs off. Goku skips a delicious meal and the story of his origins to show off to Chi Chi. This guy must be desperate for a girlfriend...yeah 'this guy' because that's not Goku.    So after Piccolo conveniently takes out Gohan while Goku's at the part, Goku senses something wrong and runs home...at the pace of a normal human I might add. Here's another extremely stupid part. Goku buries his murdered grandfather in his backyard. I could understand this is if this was the same Goku as the one in the manga who grew up away from civilization and the laws set forth, but this Goku grows up around normal people, goes to school, knows how to read, write, do math, knows the laws, etc. So the fact that he buries Grandpa Gohan in his back yard of all places is just ridiculous.    Queue Bulma's random appearance and letme tell you, this scene in particular has some of the worst acting I've ever seen. The annoying voice Rossum came up with for her character is annoying very distracting. Here comes another opposite. Goku suggests to Bulma that they go on a quest for the Dragon Balls citing to a reluctant Bulma that she may need backup whereas in the original story it was the other way around. So if Bulma suggested this would it make her seem like a weak female character? Who knows!? laugh Oh, and let's not forget Bulma and Goku coming up with the name for her Dragon Ball Energy Locating device or DBE (get it?!) I'm sure James Wong didn't think you would get the 'joke' if Bulma didn't literally spell it out for you and say '...catchy!'.    We are then put through more bad acting featuring the introduction of Chow Yun Fat as Roshi. Fat tries to be funny, but ends up acting as ridiculous and poorly as Arnold Schwarzenegger when he played Mr. Freeze in Batman & Robin. The fighting which was a flagrant ripoff of The Matrix and Spider-Man in these scenes didn't help with originality, which this movie completely lacks.    What is very annoying is the fact that Piccolo has this advanced airship yet manages to quickly fall behind in his search for the Dragon Balls.    Anyway, the film then establishes through Roshi that ki is nothing more than airbending. So instead of making the ki light-like energy, Wong goes the way of Avatar - The Last Airbender. Why? Who knows? It doesn't look like Wong or Fox actually like any of Dragon Ball though.    The next poorly-done scenes we come across feature Piccolo and Mai using Piccolo's blood to create rock-like monsters, much like Ivan Ooze's goons from the Power Rangers movie. The group then meets up with Yamcha the bandit, who in this movie for some reason has no idea how to fight even though the character of Yamcha has been established as one of the Earth's strongest/fastest fighters in the anime. After some drilling, the group somehow ends up in themiddle of a giant volcanic area. Here they meet up with Piccolo's rock-monsters and a Power Rangers fight scene occurs against the monsters who regenerate in poorly-done CGI. I mean this CGI is the kind of trash you'd see on a Sci-Fi channel movie.    The one thing that is quasi-DB inspired is when \\"Goku\\" beats up Mai (actually the only people Goku beats up besides Piccolo are women). Mai kicks him in the face and it just moves the skin on his cheek but does nothing to hurt him. Unfortunately, the fact that Goku is played by and represented as a whiny wimp like Chatwin fails to make it look believable. Goku never questions why Mai is at the volcano and doesn't even bother to mention her appearance to the rest of the group    Another thing that was pointless was Yamcha and Bulma's 'relationship'. They liked each other in the manga because their was a comical build up to it. In the movie, they had about a minute of screen-time together before they tried to make out with each other. Why? Because Bulma likes bad-boys. So it's basically a rushed version of the Han Solo/Princess Lea relationship, but poorly done.    This next part is just sickening because it basically involves James Wong taking a dump on the character of Goku. Goku is supposed to learn how to perform the kamehameha to light the torches. Roshi again stresses that the kamehameha is an air-bending technique, does the movements all wrong, then goes to bed. Goku for some reason cannot pull it off in the slightest, so he actually tries to CHEAT by using a lit candle to light the torch. Okay, when did Goku ever try to cheat during his training? He always wanted to get stronger. Anyway, Chi Chi catches him trying to cheat, and Goku complains in a whiny manner of why it's so hard to perform a kamehameha, so Chi Chi gives Goku a flirtatious incentive to light the torches. To this, Goku is suddenly able to light all the torches with ease except for the last one where Chi Chi teaches Goku to perform the move his own way. After that, Chi Chi just can't resist and she and Goku make out.    So then what happens is that poorly-done Chi Chi vs. Mai fight scene that we've all seen released awhile ago. The gun Goku is shot with doesn't just knock him unconscious, it nearly kills him. Queue a foggy ripoff scene of Peter Parker having a chat with Uncle Ben, except it's Goku and Grandpa Gohan. Oh, and Roshi uses the kamehameha (which translates in English to turtle DESTRUCTION wave) to heal Goku. Obviously, Wong did not do his research in this area.    The plot then rushes to the climax that involves Piccolo getting rattled by Yamcha's flying truck that is again a ripoff of the flying Delorean from Back to the Future. What follows is a very poorly-done scene and explanation of Piccolo and Goku's past. Marsters tried to hype up Piccolo, but he was barely in the movie at all. He had no motivation for why he was trying to destroy Earth. He wasn't the evil part of another Namek like he was in the manga/anime, he was just an alien who randomly tried to conquer Earth for NO reason whatsoever. Even more confusing is his story about Oozaru. He says to Goku that Goku is the Oozaru who he tried to conquer Earth with 2000 years prior before Piccolo was trapped by the Mafuba. He also tells Goku that Goku came to Earth on a meteor and hid amongst the humans until his 18th birthday. He then said and I quote \\"You WORKED for me!\\". So how did an 18 year-old work for someone 1,982 years before he was born? James Wong is an idiot!    The CGI for the Oozaru transformations was really poorly done. The camera kept cutting so they could skip on you seeing the transformation. The Oozaru ended up being about the size of a small bear and even kills Roshi in yet another poorly-done scene. Even though the Oozaru is choking the life out of Roshi, Roshi still manages to form coherent sentences with little trouble breathing, then suddenly dies. Oozaru then transforms back to human form in an even more poorly-done CGI scene than the initial transformation. This time it's literally four or five images, the last being the exact same camera cut of the first transformation but in reverse. Oh, and one more thing on this subject. Goku's gi gets stretched out like crazy and his belt is just gone when he's in Oozaru form, but when he transforms back into human form, his gi is magically folded up neatly and his belt is magically back in place.    And now the battle we've all been waiting for. Goku vs. Piccolo. They fight for about less than a minute before it cuts to the 'real' main even of two gunslingers, Bulma and Mai, the latter of whom is taken out by Yamcha when he shoots her (because Yamcha can't actually fight without weapons in this movie, remember?)    The fight cuts back to Goku doing a jumping kamehameha into Piccolo, knocking him out cold and saving the world in about 50 seconds. So added together, the Goku vs. Piccolo fight is about as long as the Goku vs. the high school bullies fight. Combine this with 'airbending' techniques that look like they have no power to them whatsoever. It just looks like gas spraying harmlessly through the air. After this 'intense' battle, Goku looks as clean as a whistle. No cuts, scratches, or dents to him or his outfit.    So...after wishing just Roshi back (so much for the 'perfect' wish Roshi and G. Gohan talked about - why is it perfect? Don't ask me.) instead of everyone Piccolo killed, Chow Yun Fat again attempts to be funny, but to no avail. And instead of more training, Goku decides to join Bulma and Yamcha on their quest for the Dragon Balls...but not before he goes back to Chi Chi to make out with her once again. They then have a dumb argument about why Goku knocked Chi Chi out and how she let him, so the movie ends off with some lame Matrix rip-off of Chi Chi drop-kicking Goku while Goku jumps and punches at her.    Chatwin made all this hype about Goku's hair 'evolving' through the movie the more he accepts himself. It does change, but at the end, Goku just gels it back to the style he had to start with, so so much for that.    Oh, and did I mention a native is feeding Piccolo soup and hiding him under her bed at the end? Yeah, an evil alien tries to destroy the Earth and you hide and rejuvenate him. That's brilliant!    All-in-all, the movie is bad. Very bad. It's not the kind of bad that's either so bad that you'll laugh at it or bad, but fun. It's bad and boring. tired    This movie gets a 1/10. The one point coming from the music of Brian Tyler who seems to be the only one who put any amount of effort into this movie. It's too bad that his music is drowned out by a bad story, whiny voices and bad name and special attack pronunciations the entire movie. That was all just as distracting as the eyeliner Chatwin had too much of the entire movie. I mean I know actors wear makeup when on-film, but geez. That was way too much eyeliner. It made him look weird.
0060989157|4.0|I won't re-hash what everyone else has already said, but I will suggest everyone read this book!  It's gritty and sometimes even frightening, but it's real and it rocks.    If you're looking for something a little different -- a \\"groupie book\\" so to speak -- my favorite is Blue Jean Baby: One Girl's Trip Through The 1960s L.A. Music Scene.  It shows the other side of the music scene.    Both are terrific books.
B001993Y2C|1.0|a real kick in the arse to the fans who made them rich. this set should LIST at no more than $200 tops  due to economies of scale, the pro-rated all-in-one-box mfg cost savings, and the fact that these episodes are now 'old news' so to speak. Unbeleiveable
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This was just a beautiful and sweet movie to watch. The music is emotional and well written. The performances suit it perfectly. It is a very simple story about a brief period in time drastically changing the perspective of the characters lives involved. a great romance in its easy sentiment and swooning indy music.
B00011RPB0|2.0|I hold Bill Murray in high regards.  He's simply one of the best comedic actors of the last few generations.  His timing and mannerisms are impeccable.  Similarly, Scarlett Johansson's young career has proven that her talent precedes her, and she's not a bad actress either.  Add in the concept and chemistry between the two, and this should have been a can't-miss movie.  Should have been a movie that actually deserved the praise and recognitions it received.  Instead, it's boring.<br /><br />The plot is as simple as the movie is boring.  Platonic love between an aging American star (Murray) and a bored, young girlfriend (Johansson) of a Canadian photographer on assignment in Japan.  When the two link up, they test the limits of an audience's attention span while dragging around this corpse of a movie like it's a sequel to Weekend at Bernie's.<br /><br />Oh, look!  It's Bill bored.  Hey!  It's Scarlett bored!  They're both lonely as well.  Yaaaawn.  Someone needs to hook these two up with an internet connection and a social networking website.  Or better yet, how about a Tokyo tour-guide!?  They're each disconsolate, not to mention lacking curiosity and imagination.  After a few chance encounters at a bar, they morph into pseudo-soulmates - the connection within the movie is never really established.<br /><br />The plot is underdeveloped at best, and the dialogue is so bad it causes aneurisms.  I think Murray and Johansson did what they could with the script they were given (because the acting is fine), but the writing/directing from Sofia Coppola is pathetic (no way she gets even a nomination if not for her last name).  The pacing of this movie is slightly slower than a glacial drift, and it's nearly as agonizing as being water-boarded.<br /><br />And before anyone leaves me the comment, I get it.  It's not that complicated.  It's simply uninteresting and undeserving of all the credit.  Somehow, a movie was created which caused my disinterest in not only the classically hilarious Bill Murray, but also the voluptuous vixen Scarlett Johannsen.  Before this movie, I would have thought it as likely as seeing Keanu Reeves hold an Oscar.  Speaking of which...<br /><br />The epitome of politically and financially driven recognition, the fact that this movie won an Academy Award is proof that the awards are grotesquely tainted.also the voluptuous vixen Scarlett Johannsen.

B001IBIQU6|4.0|I know there are a lot of angered people out there that will bash this album to no end. I am a life long fan of DM and while I will always think Playing The Angel is their best post- Violator work, SOTU is still a great listen. Other than Wrong (a fantastic, brooding dark track), most of these songs are not meant to be club hits or radio ready commercial tunes. I applaud DM for making the album that THEY feel best represents them after almost 30 years as a group. I personally love the analog feel of the album. I'm sure most people know by now about Martin Gore's rabid aquisition of vintage synthesizers and drum machines via ebay. It really has shaped the sound of this album. Highlight tracks are In Chains (very soulful song), Peace (great duet), Come Back, and Miles Away (I dig the fuzzed out sound of this song). Since I have the deluxe box set I will also say that the 5 B-Sides are really good. Particularly Light and Ghost which should have made it to the final cut. Esque is another instrumental and nothing special. Sun, Moon, & Stars is the other Martin Gore vocal track which has a very gypsy-like quality to it. Good track. The demo cd of random DM tracks of old are pretty bad quality, not sure why they wanted to include those. The box set has an amazing layout.<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend this to any and all DM fans as it is another side of the band. They just decided to tone it down this time around. I'm totally fine with that and will enjoy this album during times where I want to relax and reflect. For all the other times, there will always be Playing The Angel and Violator.<br /><br />Enjoy
B001TOD9VI|5.0|I have never been a wrestling fan, nor would I have ever put Mickey Rourke's name on my list of favorite actors. Until now. Despite the grittiness, the blood, the nudity and the heartache, this is a beautiful film. Because of all the pre-Oscar hoopla, I went to see this movie alone when my husband was at work and my child was at school. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I saw the film in January and I still find myself thinking about Randy the Ram. The character is unforgetable. In fact, Rourke played him so skillfully, so beautifully (sorry for the over use of that word, but it applies) that it doesn't seem as though it is a character at all. I feel as though he was a man that I knew at some point, though my life never came close to intersecting that kind of lifestyle. I have just purchased this on DVD because this is a great film. A classic. I can't wait for my [...] son to be old enough to watch this movie. I know he will be as moved as I have been.
B001RTP48Q|5.0|After the success of their first two 80s albums (PLEASE, ACTUALLY) established them as exquisite purveyors of hi-energy-fuelled POP, the PET SHOP BOYS rapidly started to experiment within the format of their music. That produced a series of works where new influences came to the fore: house (INTROSPECTIVE), electro and rock balladry (BEHAVIOUR, RELEASE), latin rhythms (BILINGUAL), disco-pop and euro-dance (VERY, NIGHTLIFE) all became part of their gleaming sound, sometimes leaving music lovers a bit surprised at these deft transformations.    It was only with FUNDAMENTAL (2006) that a return to their original style was signalled, although that album still experimented (beautifully) with techno and orchestral soul. It had been a long and fruitful journey, but it now seemed that the PSB were once again aiming at those dizzy 80s POP heights.    That is exactly what happens behind the mondrianeque cover of YES, their tenth, XENOMANIA-produced studio album. Eleven tracks, forty-eight minutes. Eleven singles, ready to triumph all over the world, if only the world were still a liveable place.    The rush and the truth of these songs is deep, intoxicating. NEIL TENNANT has now become the new COLE PORTER, his voice and lyrics striking a perfect balance between detachment and tenderness. The music glides along, serenely modern and impeccably melancholic, matching the glory of ACTUALLY to the sombre tones of BEHAVIOUR, not to mention the golden aura of that first ELECTRONIC album (JOHNNY MARR is on three tracks).    The ballads are moving and lush, courtesy of Mr OWEN PALLETT, who arranged the strings. The uptempo tracks are nimble, eminently danceable gems. Wit and elegance sparkle throughout.     Highlights? Every single track, but if we had to choose we would say: VULNERABLE, MORE THAN A DREAM and THE WAY IT USED TO BE, all breathtaking examples of pure, untouchable songwriting.    Yes, the PET SHOP BOYS are back at their POP sharpest. There is still one reason to live on this planet, after all.
B00028HBKM|5.0|i am no mel gibson enthusiast as i am no christian enthusiast, but i have to say that this is a wonderful movie. one can argue through and through either for or against the merits, validity, truth, historical accuracy, philosophy etc. of christianity, but if you put that aside and view this as a story then maybe it will hit you harder. fact of the matter is that if you look at jesus' story on a more mythological level (speaking to unbelievers) it is one of the most heroic and selfless stories in all history (or literature). this movie did such a good job portraying what it would have been like if we were to be witness to the written events. the acting is outstanding by all actors. to suit the title this movie has a driving passion to it to reveal a hero of humanity. there are so many moments in this movie that make note of the tragedy of mankind, in that hatred exists so heavily throughout the world and throughout history. however, there are central characters that exist in history to show peace and love like christ or buddha or ghandi, etc. there is a point to this story that is so much more important than religion.
B0018AK9RA|3.0|Actually, I give \\"Nostradamus\\" 3.5 stars. After living with this album for awhile, I've come to the conclusion that Priest have attempted a risky, grand musical experiment to stretch their wings. On that count, they have succeeded. But I don't honestly think Judas Priest intend this style of album to be the way they will write and perform for the rest of their now finite career.<br /><br />I see a lot of reviewer complements for the rich production and scale of this epic album, but I also see complaints about how they aren't making yet another album of crunching metal. To those people, I say -- it's about artistic growth, guys! ANY artist should not continually repeat themselves over an over again in a weak attempt to hold onto past glories: they should strive to create, create, CREATE; even if it doesn't turn out perfect.<br /><br />The only things I have to criticize \\"Nostradamus\\" for are thus: overlength -- distilling the best bits down to a single 75-minute album might have served this material and concept better. Also; the ballads work very well but the \\"heavy\\" songs are let down by a somewhat thin guitar sound. Trying not to frighten some new, possibly more mainstream fans, perhaps?<br /><br />The fact that this album can be viewed as a prog-rock anachronism by a band in the twilight of their very long and successful career is almost irrelevant: sometimes, one just HAS to get a big, creative urge off their chest to avoid stagnation. Perhaps Priest WILL make one more concise, hard-hitting, \\"pure\\" Heavy Metal album before they finally go out of business after 1 or 2 more tours. Because lets face it: you only have to SEE the sweat and exhaustion of these men during their epic shows to realise that music like theirs requires virtually Olympian stamina and skill to pull off. As always, Heavy Metal of this standard is, from a perfomance point of view, a \\"young mans game\\". And none of us live forever, eh?<br /><br />Let's cut them some slack and realise that \\"Nostradamus\\" will soon take a special place in their extraordinary legacy. Oh, and by the way: I have forgiven Judas Priest for cancelling New Zealand in 2008/2009. But please, guys -- I've waited more than 20 years to see you. PLEASE come to N.Z. or Australia before you end the band's career!!place in their extraordinary legacy. Oh, and by the way: I have forgiven Judas Priest for cancelling New Zealand in 2008/2009.

B00005JPTK|4.0|I AM LEGEND    When Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND came off the press in 1954, he had no idea that his story of the future would see three film incarnations.  In 1964 LAST MAN ON EARTH with Vincent Price premiered with its stark black and white images of a war torn European city. 1971's OMEGA MAN with Charlton Heston reflected the current society of the late 60's with its violent iconoclasts.    In 2007 Will Smith would bring a different take on the character of a noble scientist in I AM LEGEND.  With his faithful companion, Sam, a devoted German shepherd given to him by his daughter, he patrolled the desolate streets of New York City during the day.    Every day he broadcasted the same message to an apparently silent world.  \\"Food, shelter and security\\" were more than words to this Dr. Robert Neville.  For him and Sam over 1000 lonely days have passed since the end came. Sometimes, the desire for the past can  lead one to the verge of insanity, especially of the past is clouded by the mists of lost hopes.    Unfortunately, the end did not come for those humans who mutated after exposure to the miracle cure for cancer.  They became a new species who lived together like a hive in the shadows of dead buildings.  They became prowlers roaming the streets at night searching for fresh blood.    The only fault of this film is that the mutants both human and dogs are too super in their abilities.  Unlike the previous two films, the mutants are not really believable, especially the dogs.  It is difficult to have pity for them since every trace of humanity has been ripped from their souls.  However, there is a twist near the end of the film.    Neville's experiments on the mutants were his desperate attempt to find a cure, to bring normalcy back to a barbaric land filled with savages.  Of course, the mutants knew him and Sam all too well.  During the day they were ever watching for him from the dark shadows of their lives.  This day creature and his dog were their mortal enemies.    The story is well written.  Will Smith gives another A+++ performance. James Newton Howard adds another excellent musical score to his impressive library.    This DVD contains an alternate ending on disk two which differs from the first two films.  In many ways, I prefer this ending to the theatre version.    This is what the second disk offers: for there comes a time, when two evolving races must find common ground or face total annihilation.  This \\"controversial ending\\" gives a hint of hope that true humanity will never die.
B0013NAP2G|3.0|I got this DVD a week ago. Honestly, her singing is quite acceptable, though not at her prime. But what shocked me is, like some of the reviewers have mentioned, she really turned herself into a soprano diva of classical music, physically I mean. She was too huge, compared to all the others on stage. She should pay attention to that. Afterall, she is a performer and quite a good-looking one. She shouldn't allow that to happen.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This was one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen. The story, music, acting and cinematography were equally brilliant. Right from the beginning of the movie i was sucked in to its pleasurable mix of \\"reality\\" and \\"fantasy\\". I think the ultimate pay off was the fantastic collapse of both worlds leading to our protaganists new found understanding in life. What may have been the best of this movie though is that i typically hate child actors trying to be serious, but the girl in this film was outstanding and absolutely believable. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. It was immediately catapulted to one of my all time favorites.
B0000029DD|4.0|I really enjoy one of the songs on the album, so after downloading an MP3 of the song from Amazon, I decided to buy the complete album.  I like the other songs on the album as well.  What more can I say?  Sorry, not quite the 75 to 300 words you wanted.
B001G0MFOM|2.0|Ok...where do i start? Well the 6th season of the l word i think was a HUGE waste of time. Not only did they spend too much time on characters that weren't going anywhere as far as storyline. And they didnt spend enough time finishing up the story lines with great characters (ie. Bette and Tina.) which were probably the only characters in the end that you could take seriously. I found myself wanting to fast forward too many parts through out this season that were just a waste of airtime. *spoiler* I dont believe anyone killed Jenny. If you watched the series from the beginning, its just not in any of the girls to kill anyone. It would be sooo out of character.*   As far as the characters this season, they felt rushed, no depth anymore, no wedding,no really good cameos, nothing.    Alice: Funny as usual, great character.    Shane: Apparently she went insane this season and decided to date jenny and not believe any of her friends.    Kit: No depth to her character anymore, just a few \\"kittisms\\".    Helena: WHY was she in this season! wasnt she a strong working woman at   the very beginning? they turned her into a character with no point.    Max: IC turned Max into a joke this season. No depth to the character. once again, rushed.    Bette: Still the same strong character from season 1, she's actually grown as a person and she shows it in season 6. great job with her.    Tina: More of a stronger person this season. Her scenes with Bette makes the whole season 6 more interesting.    Tasha: umm what can i say. *Spoiler* the friend threesome thing was a very bad story line. IC trying to bring drama into places it shouldnt be. Why cant these characters just be happy?    Jenny: soooo Rushed. Season 6 made Jenny look like she really went crazy. We all knew she was a little off. But she just turned out to be a Snob,whiny, and sometimes acted like a 5 yr old.    *spoiler* Nothing was answered in season 6. Every character was left in the dark about something. And this show didnot end with a bang like it should have. season 1-5 are great! but season 6 was just a waste of airtime and a lot of disapointment. I'll buy it to complete my collection but it definitely is NOT going to be opened or watched.
B001RTP48G|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys are the Beatles of Electronic/Dance/Synthpop music. They write some of the smartest, bittersweet lyrics and combine them with lush moving electronic soundscapes that make you want to dance and sometimes cry. True artists with vision who show that electronic music does not have to be cold and shallow.     It's been said that they make electronic music for the thinking man and I have to agree. They also make dance music for people who cannot( and in my case don't want to)dance. Yes is full of upbeat songs with just a bit of melancholy and irony thrown in to keep it interesting.    Yes is without doubt a masterwork, one of the best they have ever done. Music that can make you think and ( if your so inclined ) dance! It doesn't get any better than this. Get the Special Edition with the Bonus Disc and the 7 extra tracks, it is well worth the extra buck or two it will cost you.
B000066744|5.0|This movie came out not too long after i was soarly disgusted by the horriblness that was the movie titanic. The point of my mentioning that is that titanic was a horrendous movie. this movie, similar in its epic sea bound struggles and beauties is a magnificent piece of work. Tim roth plays the role of 1900 in top form. Tornatore's direction is romantic, elegant and takes you in with the loneliness that is the charactor. I was in high school when this came out and it was my big introduction into the music of morricone. The score for this is one of the most beautiful cinematic compositions i have ever heard. For years i have said that this movie is possibly my favorite movie of all time and it seems as though it is staying there holding that title.
B001AQT0SG|4.0|I wish it was Lynch's version of Dune that could have been six hours long instead of the SciFi miniseries; although its inaccuracies with the complex story issues like spice-induced navigation and the weirding ways ultimately leaves it mildly flawed, the cast, the costumes, the sets, the production design are all excellent and are now what come to mind when I read the books. The voice-overs in particular are very reminiscent of the books' inner calculations and political maneuverings.    I hope this is being given a special-edition treatment, but I admit I would be happy if they simply took the HD transfer on the HD-DVD and slap it on Blu.
B001C4CI8A|5.0|Definitely purchase this title if you like the spy-thriller genre.  This movie holds audience attention from the beginning to the end.

B001NY42KQ|5.0|i am not going to rant and rave like a little girl about this as i am not one, but i will say that this movie is simply pure, easy fun. i give this 5 stars as i would give any of the astair/rodgers musicals. it is a very simple story line of the american musical genre (boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back). the music fun, catchy and well thought. the cinematography is appealing. the performances held their own. my wife and i are both performers and are nerds for simple musical films like this. it's great for kids of course. enjoy!
006135323X|5.0|I could not decide if I wanted to buy this book at first. I have always wanted to know what drives people to make decisions and where they come from. This excellent book helps describe where some of people decisions come from. The first couple of chapters will help sales people learn how to use pricing strategies or what kind of person to take with you to a party if you are looking to meet people. There is so much information in here you will be amazed.<br /><br />You will see that not all of your decisions make sense no matter how conscious you think you are.
1582701709|1.0|\\"The Secret\\" is the biggest load of garbage since Colin Powell stood before the world selling the idea that Iraq had WMD.  If you want to spend your time hearing a bunch of egomaniacal cretins spew hours of horse manure go ahead.  To suggest that such a thing as the \\"law of attraction\\" actually exists and then to go on about how to make it work for you is ludicrous. Basically what you have is a bunch of self professed experts pimping a science that does not exist.  The only secret about \\"The Secret\\" is that you can't see the feces eating grins on the author's and contributors'faces as they take their royalty checks to the bank.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I'm a huge P&P/Jane Austen fan, and I enjoyed how the movie (directed by Dan Zeff) changed much of the plot and dialogue while still capturing the period flavor and wit of P&P (on at least one occasion it also recalls \\"Emma\\"). I'm sure many of the female fans love the Darcy character, and the \\"Colin Firth wet puffy pirate shirt\\" scene (okay, it's not a puffy pirate shirt, but close enough), but for me, the wit of the movie is the charm; it captures much of the spirit of P&P without copying it, so that I found myself laughing often throughout the movie.     One caution is that if you are not familiar with 18th/19th century British culture and the Austen canon, you may not appreciate some of the humor.     I assume anyone reading this review is probably familiar with one or more of the P&P's on DVD, but my favorite is the BBC version with David Rintoul and Elizabeth Garvie, my favorite Darcy and Lizzie. I also liked the Keira Knightley version (Keira Knightley is one of my favorite actresses), although the 5-hour Colin Firth version is objectively even better. Also highly recommended is Bride & Prejudice (with Aishwarya Rai), the Indian takeoff of P&P which should not be missed if you like a good, fun spectacle with great music and dancing. Surprisingly, the 1940 version of P&P with Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson is probably the weakest of the major movie versions, although it is still quite entertaining. If you have seen one or more of these movies, or read P&P the novel, it should greatly enhance your enjoyment of Lost in Austen.    And now, having written this review, I am quite at leisure.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I truly wish that michael bay would have stopped making movies after this horrible excuse for a film.
B000YABYLA|2.0|Dear heavens, this movie just tried a little too hard to be indie, cutesy and edgy. Those things should happen naturally, not someone sitting down at a screen and saying hmmm, let me write something indie and cutesy. Utterly unbelievable look at teenage pregnancy, this movie still hurts my brain whenever I think about it. I give it two stars because the ending was oddly touching if predictable, and I love the song \\"Superstar\\" and have since downloaded the very cool Sonic Youth version featured in the film.
B00003CWPL|5.0|David Lynch's first film, Eraserhead, is a very odd beast, a cinematic experience on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey or 8 1/2.  The hype on this one is for real, this movie truly is odd and very dark, though it may not be scary for some, especially for people who are used to or merely find surreal, bizarre, creepy things extremely entertaining and awesome (raise hand).  Eraserhead is not a perfect movie.  It's heavy on the symbolism (one of most overrated aspects of art), but the images are creepy and quite breathtaking actually. it's one of the very movies that's heavy of symbolism that works.  It's not a mere crappy boring art movie made by some idiot.  It's still a little pretentious (as most Lynch movies, especially Mulholland Drive), but unlike the average \\"art\\" movie that has no atmosphere, this one is very immerse and creates a world that you will not want to leave, and will enjoy the whole ride for it's 90 minute running time.  From the creepy images, to the stunning atmosphere and immerse world, it's a great movie to watch alone, at midnight, with good speakers.  It will immerse you into the world of this movie.<br /><br />Eraserhead doesn't have much of a plot to speak of, and to be honest, I still have no idea what this movie is about 100 percent, especially after Henry's girlfriend leaves him.  Lynch himself hasn't give many comments to what the movie means.  According to him, this movie is what he was experiencing in Philly at the time, \\"a dream of dark and troubling things\\", and he has also added that this is most spiritual movie (as there was a bible verse that, according to him, fulfilled his own vision).  It's widely said that Eraserhead is about fatherhood (he began this movie when his first wife was pregnant), but Lynch has said that every interpretation has yet to match his.  Hopefully he might one day say what it is about, but for now, it just leaves us to make our own interpretation.<br /><br />This movie needs to be watched properly, as watching this in the day would probably diminish the impact greatly.  This movie isn't merely a movie, it's a cinematic experience.  Few movies out there have as much immerse atmosphere and surreal images, this is the reason why surreal can sometimes be breathtaking.  Unlike his other movies which would cross on boring and feel like any other art movie, Eraserhead never loses interest.  And really, how could you go wrong with the Lady in the Radiator, the head in the pool of blood, the baby, and the utterly ugly but strangely beautiful industrial decayed landscape?  Further backed by this is a fantastic sound design work, and the movie would be lost without it.  It's rife with howling wind, a machine-like ambiance, industrial sounds, and various sound effects, from the creepy tinging of a music box, sirens, the whiny cry of the baby, the splattering of a chicken spewing blood, to the delightfully creepy sparse dialogue. The black and white shooting only heightens the experience a great deal.<br /><br />And really, that's the final cement of Eraserhead's watch-ability, in my opinion.  Despite all of the symbolic elements of the film, taking the whole thing literately works extremely well, perhaps even moreso than symbolically.  Sure, you can find meaning in the decoder-ring symbolism that gives about the same \\"a ha!\\" satisfaction an ink-blot test (well, not quite.  But sometimes it feels like that.  And that's not good).  But literately, it just works like a surreal dream, an otherworldly world like no other.  Given all of the creepy images, the atmosphere, the sound design, and everything else listed above, taking it all literately gives you one of the most unique experiences ever put onto film.<br /><br />The DVD is kind of expensive, and the documentary is surprisingly nice considering it's just David Lynch talking for 90 minutes at length.  There really is no deleted scene, just a scene that was cut from the film that plays in the background.  However, even though it takes some thought of what you want this movie to be like, once you get into it, you'll find the 22 dollars will bring you a lot and lot of experiences in the world of Eraserhead.  And that is why this movie continues to compel to this day.kes some thought of what you want this movie to be like, once you get into it, you'll find the 22 dollars will bring you a lot and lot of experiences in the world of Eraserhead.

0756405890|5.0|The chapters are very short, so it's easy to pick up during breaks in your day. No time is wasted getting to the meat of story (within a story).  Author writes with a fluidity that makes for a quick and satisfying read.    Recommended if you like Lord of the Rings, Robin Hobb trilogies, and the ongoing saga of A Song of Fire and Ice.  Not as graphic/adult as George R. R. Martin books, but it doesn't need to be.      I found myself up all night reading, which is rare.    My only warning is that you will want the second (and third) books immediately after reading it.  This yearning is exactly what the first book in a trilogy should achieve.  I can only hope the wait for the next books is worth it...It must be a challenge to make sure the rest of the story is on par with this one.
B000P0J0B0|5.0|This movie was brilliant in so many ways. In satire it was unique and adventageous. In cinema it was risky and original. In acting it was over the top and on crack. Everything this movie offers is worth more than one viewing and multiple discussions on the importance and relevance of morality and common sense in pop culture.
1415926697|5.0|I listened to the CD on the way up north and thoroughly enjoyed the story, the telling (the author reads it herself), and the thoughts of this writer. It's not meant to be a travel book describing the various countries she visits; it's about her inner journey. I identified with her experience as a flawed human being (aren't we all?) and shared her success as she worked toward her goal. After listening to the CD, I went out and bought the book (and I usually borrow books from the library). Her words were particularly comforting to me during a very hard time in my life, so I thank Ms. Gilbert for that. Plus, in some places it's hilarious.
B000I0QM0E|3.0|I like this movie very much, I am a Tim Burton fan for years, that's the main reason why I bought it; but I must say that i was not impressed with this Blu-Ray vertion I got to say not the best DVD transfer out there these days.<br /><br />Still I enjoy the movie very much!
B000FS9FCG|4.0|This is a fun science fiction film.  Natalie Portman is great.  It is a new Brave New World big brother is here and it is not too far off.
B000001ES9|3.0|This album makes one thing very clear - Rush (in their early days) was a band very badly in need of Neil Peart.  The difference between this album and Fly By Night is significant.  This is a fun rock n roll disc, very derivative of Led Zeppelin, but isn't up to par for a band that would later create such classics as Moving Pictures and Signals (for example).  Fly By Night, however, does have that character.<br /><br />Neil Peart's arrival is what made all the difference.  John Rutsey definitely sounded good here, but didn't have the maniacal energy and mindbending virtuosity that Peart brought to the band.  Additionally, Peart's lyrics are sorely missing.  I'm not sure who wrote the lyrics on this album, but they are pretty rudimentary and at times amateurish.  Love 'em or hate 'em, Peart's lyrics were thought-provoking and often interesting (even when they may have been a little over-the-top as on 2112).  By the early 80s, they were often outstanding.<br /><br />I'm not sure what Rush's trajectory would have looked like had Neil Peart not joined the band.  Fortunately, we never had to find out.  This album goes a long way toward displaying how essential Peart was to the band's trajectory.<br /><br />In summary, a fun album definitely worth your time if you are already a Rush fan.  But if you're looking for one of the classic Rush albums, I'd start with Fly By Night.
B0015DROBO|2.0|As usual, I'll be brief.  This book came highly recommended.  I found the dialog to be \\"off\\", maybe because of a translation issue.  There is a ton of boring backstory.  There is one interesting character (the girl with the tattoo) but she is sporadically included and the stories do not mesh well together.  I finished it, but considered bailing several times.
B001N26GFM|5.0|[[ASIN:B001N26GFM The Boy in the Striped Pajamas]] I ordered this movie from Amazon for my mom. When it came, my dad accidently picked it up with some movies to be returned to Blockbuster. They bought it from him! So I ordered it, again, from Amazon. It arrived very quickly, both times, and is a very intrigueing story. You may cry at the end, but will enjoy the film.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|I have to admit, I thought this album was \\"okay\\" the first few times I listened to it. I'm a HUGE Smashing Pumpkins fan, so I was a little disappointed.    But then I listened to it a few more times over the next few weeks, and slowly began to absolutely LOVE IT. It's one of the best Pumpkins albums ever and I can't get enough of it!
B000FS9MV0|5.0|Skylark - Renee Olstead may be young but she shows great style and technique in her vocals. Easy to listen to, she sings with effortless grace. Had the privilege of seeing her on the 'Today' show 2 yrs. ago- have been a fan ever since. Down the road, I have no doubt she will be added to the list of GREAT vocalists, Sarah Vaughn, Ella Fitzgerald, Diana Krall, etc.
6305127646|5.0|I agree totally with reviewer \\"Ryan\\", so I won't repeat him. I'll just add that if you are a fan of Val Kilmer you can't get better than this movie. It's very Kilmerish in every way!
B000V86OKG|5.0|I don't have cable so I was introduced to Dexter by my sister when she bought me the first season for Christmas.....Fell in LOVE!!!  Season 2 was even better!  Can't wait to see what happens next.

1595141979|5.0|I will keep this brief...This book was fantastic! I caught myself wanting to leave work early and going to bed late just to get as much in as I could.(with all three books mind you) I'd definately recommend this book/series to anyone who is or isnt into vampire/fantacy style writing. The writing was captivating. The characters and relationships were easy to identify with and grow to understand. You'll find yourself cheering and crying for Dimitri and Rose. And in the end you'll be literally crying for more, and to just know...(I dont want to spoil) but Dimitri?!     Needless to say I have already ordered Book 4...But I gotta wait 4 months...UGH!
B000003TA4|5.0|Kurt Cobain wanted to take revenge on the Yuppie, Hippie, jerks, who are / were in constant control over the music of his time. He was mocking, filthy, irreverent, and would distance all who were in the box. His screaming was a laugh and a howl at those who could not see outside there own views. So, the critics called it grunge, which made him famous, and Kurt hated them for it.<br /><br />Where are we today? Rap and [...] roll is MTV. We are not seeing true punk bands, but emo kiddies; these days are worse then in the beginning of the 90's... Mr. Cobain and his love for the Meat Puppets, Pixies, and his most influential band Mudhoney, would form his sound. Kurt tried to down play his records, he failed at that on NEVERMIND... he sold OUT, went BIG on MTV. \\"In Bloom\\" was the video showing how Kurt even mocked his own fame and fortune. Yet, folks still listen too him still, sorry yuppies and JOCKS, if you don't like it, Nevermind!<br /><br />This was a tortured soul, a real scream, and a musician that did hate his depressive world. The tide was turning and he was looking ahead to a brighter future. But, this record is about not conforming, but he had to concede, thats just what happened. Kurt Cobain will have his revenge on yuppies! ! !

B0009Q0F5U|3.0|A nice CD (\\"Passacaglia\\" is a particular highlight), but not a patch on the soundtracks for [[ASIN:B000FCUYKO seasons two]] and [[ASIN:B000UZ4C4A three]], where many themes from this release are expanded. Of course, this is the one to get if you want to have the opening credits theme, be it the UK (and, from season 2 on, US) or original (season 1) US version.
B0001I561E|2.0|I ordered a video on line for the first time and was very disappointed. First it took almost a month to receive.  Then when I get it I open it to find that the DVD will not play due to all the scratches and some kind of film on the DVD.  This has been the worst experience for me and will not use amazon.com again.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Jeff Beck is in a league of his own. His musis style is unique and by far one of the best guitar players of all time. This cd captures the true Jeff Beck style of music.
0743454537|4.0|I'm not going to include a summary of this book, just simply my impressions.  I'll start off by saying this is by no means a feel good book.  But it is an honest look at human emotions, and relationships.  I appreciate that Ms. Picoult doesn't try to sugar coat complex, emotionally  charged issues.  I enjoy that this book is written from multiple viewpoints to really get to the heart of the issue.  My one beef with this book is the ending...which is kind of a cop out to me.  In spite of that I feel that this is a well-written, worthwhile novel.
0743290119|1.0|I love fun chick lit as a \\"breather\\" between the actual real books in my life, and I'm a few chapters into this and thinking of burning it. It is terrible, shallow, lame, and BORING.  The characters are barely elevated stereotypes. At least the Devil Wears Prada was very funny!    What a sad book. I actually ripped off the cover because I was embarrassed to be reading it on the subway. I think its ready for the recycle bin! Don't waste your money, buy something else.
B000FC2JTS|5.0|I have had several friends read this book and finally feel for the first time as if they have control and power.  They have for many years dated and not understood why someone would stand them up or forget to call many times.  They would listen to the reasons and give them chance after chance.  I would watch and it would drive me crazy.  I would try to tell them that they did not have to put up with this and that if the guy cared he would not stand them up unless he was hospitalized and he would always call.  When these same relationships would end my girl friends would need to have some type of closure while the men would just stop calling.  They needed some final conversation to get the picture.  I think this book is great.  You have to use common sense and realize that one missed call or missed date could have been an emergency, but two means he just is not that into you! Being stood up more than once should give you a clue but some women always ignore these events.  This books helps those that cannot see the messages.  I think most of us can tell if a guy is shy or awkward. But we need to understand the ones that are just playing the field with many women.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|This 1995 six-part production of Pride and Prejudice is easily my favourite of the four different films that I've seen which are based on the novel; really, it's a complete delight and I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen the series as of yet.<br /><br />The new Blu-ray release looks spectacular; this is a new scan taken directly from the original super 16 mm negative.  Now, I've heard some people commenting (in disparaging tones) that in this transfer the film looks extremely grainy, but I honestly have to disagree.  There is some very fine film grain visible throughout, which is inherent to the super 16 format, but it is minimal in my opinion.  I'm watching this on a fifty inch plasma set, and the grain is barely noticeable (I've seen 35 mm films which looked much grainier), so for me this is not an issue at all.<br /><br />One major difference between this release, and the earliest video transfers of the series, is that the aspect ratio of the image has been changed in the new version. (See the comparison photos that accompany Amazon's product information.)  I suppose I don't mind losing a bit of the picture off of the top and bottom of the frame, when so much more is added to the sides. Though the question is, why couldn't the ENTIRE frame be included? I suppose it's because people with wide-screen televisions want the entire screen to be filled with an image. Super 16 has an aspect ratio of 1.66:1, while high-definition televisions have an aspect ratio of 1.78:1----so, if the entire film frame was shown, there would be thin black bars on each side of the picture when viewed on a wide-screen television.  I personally would have preferred to see the film in the 1.66:1 aspect ratio, but as it is, the picture does not appear to be unduly cropped on the top and bottom of the frame.<br /><br />Okay, enough of the tech talk; let's just say the picture looks fantastic; I don't think anyone has ever seen this film looking this good previously.<br /><br />I have only a few minor quibbles with this adaptation... let's see.... Well, there's the fact that Julia Sawalha as Lydia is perhaps a bit too old for the part. And I think she plays the character a bit too much in \\"lusty serving wench\\" mode, as compared to just being an extremely thoughtless, selfish, and air-headed young girl... Susannah Harker is, I think, quite lovely and absolutely perfect as Jane, but physically she looks nothing at all like any of the other four girls who played the Bennet sisters; she's a completely different physical type, and it's difficult to believe that she is related to the rest of the Bennets... Miss Bingley and Mrs Hurst were perhaps not quite as well-behaved as they ought to have been; I've always had the impression that they would have had quite impeccable manners, even as they were cutting you dead... And I perhaps have a few other small reservations, but these are as nothing compared to the overall enjoyment I get from this picture; it's a fantastic film.<br /><br />(I always get a laugh out of how so many female viewers swoon over Mr Darcy. Oh, he's attractive enough I suppose, but I always thought that Crispin Bonham-Carter as Mr Bingley was far more appealing.)<br /><br />The Blu-ray has a few interesting extras, including an hour-long programme that contains a lot of interviews with members of the cast. It's interesting to see how people have changed in the years since the film was made---some people have aged very well indeed, and others terribly! My only disappointment is that the small amount of extra \\"behind the scenes\\" material that was on the old special edition DVD is not also included on this new release.h this adaptation... let's see....

B001RRX336|5.0|For some reason no stores in my area has the regular 2 CD set of \\"The Who Sell Out\\" and Amazon does not have one listed other than the overpriced SHm-CD version listed here. I recently got my copy from another online retailer for $20.00. So this is the one I am reviewing.<br /><br />The collection contains both the original stereo and mono mixes of the album. This is not a repackage of the 1995 release even though a lot of the extras that appeared there are here but in a different mix. The mono mix might be of more interest for fans since it has not been available in the U.S. since 1967. There are subtle nuances in the mix overall, the music and the commercial jingles meld more seamlessly than its stereo counterpoint in such a way that it does feel like your listening to a pirate radio station. On \\"Our Love Was\\" the solo guitar break is completely different than the stereo version.<br /><br />The stereo mix is a re-mastered version of the original Kit Lambert mix from 1967 so any embellishments that John Astley did in 1995 are now gone. In addition \\"Rael\\" is also presented with its original mix as well as a re-recorded version on disc one. Apparently, the original tape was thrown in the trash and a nasty edit had to be made in the songs first line. This track was re-stored by John Astley on the \\"Maximum R&B\\" box set and on the 1995 re-issue.<br /><br />Another bonus is more of the PAMS jingles that were intended for the rest of the album in-between the extra tracks. There are also early mixes of other tracks as well as a few hidden ones so this pretty much surpasses the 1995 edition especially if you were not a fan of the work John Astley did in cleaning up the recording.<br /><br />Again, if you do find this at your local retailer pick it up. This has to be one of The Who's best album pre-Tommy and probably the last when they actually used a lot of great vocal harmonies. Finally, a great re-issue of a great album. Oh, as a bonus there is a small re-print of the original poster that originally came with the albume with the album
B001IB63KQ|5.0|I'm kind of late getting this set, but better late than never.  I was excited to see a Live Album and DVD combo from my favorite band and I was not disappointed.  I'm a bit older than the majority of Paramore fans, but I felt like a kid again after watching this DVD.  I couldn't contain my desire to jump around my room (in Iraq mind you) and sing the songs even though I'll never be close to Hayley's amazing vocal range.    The DVD really made me realize how much Paramore cares about their fans, and how down to Earth they are.  I've not been able to see them live yet, but they definitely just got added to the list of bands I need to see next year.  Can't wait for their next album later this summer.    Go Paramore!!
B000FC1192|5.0|When I first saw the preview for Coraline I knew I had to see it. I love stop action animation and it makes me sad that not to many movies are  made that way now a days. I loved the movie. I just have to say that book is a quick and easy read (because it is a children's book) but the story is a lot of fun. Coraline is charming. I wish I had read it when I was younger because I am sure I would have liked it even more
0765348276|5.0|I'd mostly echo the positive things others have said about Old Man's War and add that I thoroughly enjoyed the entire trilogy. This is some of the best hard sci-fi I've read ever, and I've been reading sci-fi for about 30 years, from Asimov to Zelazny. If you like Niven, Heinlein, Pohl, ... you'll like Scalzi. Truly great sci-fi with some very cool ideas, plus wonderful characterization, humor and action and an engrossing plot.   Oh and as a counterpoint to the review that said it's not for younger readers ... other than one totally non-gratuitous sex scene in Old Man's War, and a fair bit of cussing, this series is very accessible to young adult readers. My 12 year old son, who is an avid sci-fi reader (mostly stuff like Artemis Fowl and Pendragon) says Old Man's War is among his favorite novels, and he's now halfway through The Ghost Brigades.  Highly recommended.

By the end I was saying \\"it can not be over\\"!  I was amazed how fast I was drawn in. If you liked the Buffy musical episode then just click buy now. You will not be disappointed. If you thought it was the worst of the series then you might want to rent it first.
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|The Terminator series is classic entertainment. This Blu-ray transfer is very good. The picture is good and the sound even better. I recommend this dvd highly, especially Arnold fans.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|We do not subscribe to HBO, so I never saw the TV series until it came on TBS last year (2008). I got hooked to the series and enjoyed the movie. This is definatley a \\"Woman's Movie\\" or one for a man who wants to understand women better ( the basic nature of a woman.) This movie is not for anyone under the age of 17 because of the language and nudity. I do hope they make a sequel to the movie.

B000022TSV|5.0|The 1984 Rosi film is a brillant and beautifilly photographed version of what is probably the best known opera.  A terrific way to introduce a novice to this musical form with wonderful performances by Placido Domingo and the very earthy and sexy Julia Migenes-Johnson.  A film classic that is sadly out-of-print in the U.S.    Now, about those outrageously priced collectors copies to which there is a resonable alternative.  For less than the price of several of the used copies, it is possible to buy an all-region DVD player from Amazon for around $100-$125. Then you purchase a region 2 copy of Carmen from Amazon's U.K. service.  You'll get the same great movie for $34.99 and have the ability to play DVDs from around the world.  An added advantage is that the region 2 import of Carmen is anamorphic, providing a better picture than the grossily overpriced U.S. edition.       Carmen is a tremendous film, but $175.00 for a used copy and $1495.00 for a factory-sealed edition?  What arrogance!
0756405890|5.0|This has to be one of the most well written novels I have read in years.  You find yourself unable to put the book down, unable to \\"skip ahead\\", and thoroughly enjoying yourself.  As a matter of fact I finished this book, turned back to page one and re-read it to make sure I didn't miss anything.      The character's come alive when you read, you find yourself cheering with them, holding your breath and hoping that it will never end. The only downfall is that the next book isn't out yet.    I have read Jordan, Martin, Tolkien, Hobb, Douglass, Goodkind, Rawn,  Berg, etc... Rothfuss work is among the top of them.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|I was reluctant to watch this film since I heard from several people that it was confusing, but I sucked it up and decided to rent it. This movie is not confusing in the least bit, everything ties in smoothly. Completely action packed, something you would expect from this film. But what I got that i was not expecting where the deep emotions and how you saw him being torn all the time. Great film, worthy of everybody's watching
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I'm not exaggerate when I say that the mere existence of this program should be considered reason enough to buy a Blu-ray player and a TV that will showcase every last pixel.  From incredible vistas to the small, private moments of the tiniest creatures, the colors and sights never fall short of amazing.  Its imagery is so astonishing even those who shy away from Animal Planet and PBS will be totally riveted.  The Episodes \\"Caves\\" and \\"Deep Sea\\" are personal favorites.    This version has David Attenborough's original British narration, which I prefer to the American TV version with Sigourney Weaver, but I suppose it is a matter of personal preference.    I previously owned the DVD set of Planet Earth, and, as others have mentioned, the Blu-ray is missing an interesting series of making-of featurettes about the crew who filmed this remarkable program, as well as Planet Earth: The Future, a bonus episode.  Even so, the Blu-ray's picture quality more than makes up for the lack of special features.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|If you are a John Mayer fan looking to test out your Home Theater system this is a great benchmark.  This was the first disc I popped into my system to test out my Definitive Mythos STS speakers.  There's some great tracks for testing out the high-end and mid-range of your system as well as the low end.  The Blu-ray version does a pretty good job of capturing the whole performance, and the audio quality is superb.  The guitars sound crisp and melodic, although you will hear some reverberation effect, especially in the vocals.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have always liked Coldplay. I had A Rush of Blood to the Head and played it to death. After watching the Grammy's and seeing that Coldplay won so much, I decided to catch up and buy X&Y and Viva La Vida. Even though radio hasn't given them much play, their music is fantastic! The use of instruments not usally heard makes their music both universal and worldly. Their rhythm, personalized vocals, harmonies and sweeping grand music makes them one of the greatest bands of the decade! I highly recommend their music.
B00026ZG10|5.0|From start to finish, `True Lies' is nothing short of engaging.  In fact, it is more than that.  It is funny, tense, gripping and even, get this, shockingly tender.  Yes, `True Lies' has just about everything you could ask for all rolled up in one nicely constructed package.  It is so `complete' that it doesn't even matter that the film is above and beyond ridiculous (that is to say that it makes no sense whatsoever and manages to be very, very unrealistic).  It makes up for every flaw with stellar performances, witty dialog, eye-popping visuals and endearing characters.<br /><br />One great thing about this movie is that, even when the action sequences are beyond unrealistic (the horse chase scene and the jet rescue ending are two of the more over-the-top sequences) they never look fake.  This isn't so CGI ridden that the film appears nothing more than a videogame.  Thankfully each and ever scene looks as if it is really happening and thus adds to the film a layer of credibility.<br /><br />It works even if it technically shouldn't.<br /><br />The film follows a seemingly boring family, the Tasker's, as their world unravels when Harry, the `computer salesman' husband, begins to suspect that his wife Helen is having an affair.  He overreacts and thus compromises his own identity (he's a secret spy, duh) when he uses his position to investigate his wife.  When a real case he's working crosses the line into his home life he finds that his entire family is thrown in the frying pan and he desperately tries to pull them out.<br /><br />The entire cast works wonderfully; even Arnold.  Well, I guess I should specify that, since there are two Arnold's here.  Tom Arnold is hilarious.  I really like him as the goofy sidekick (which he plays in EVERY film really, although he stretched himself with major success in 2005's `Happy Endings') and here he delivers each line with the right amount of comedic sarcasm.  The other Arnold, Schwartzenegger that is, is also perfect for the role.  He even emotes here, which I was shocked to see.  He's funny and debonair and moving at times.  He's not perfect, that's for sure, but he works far better than I though he would.  Bill Paxton has a hilarious supporting role as a used car salesman trying to put the moves on Helen.<br /><br />Speaking of Helen, Jamie Lee Curtis is above and beyond spectacular here.<br /><br />Curtis knows how to make this character feel human.  She has the right comedic touches to her general being to make her appear naturally out of her element, which adds layers of realism to her giddy nature and even her over-controlled side.  She also knows how to add enough heart to her character to make her tenderer and sincere moments feel genuine.  Her interrogation scene is a marvelous example of an actress adding so many layers and so many notes that her character becomes so much more than just a `housewife'.  She plays the funny, awkward, confused, desperate housewife with a tough-as-nails side to utter perfection.<br /><br />Director James Cameron is no stranger to special effects and action spectacles and so the action scenes are no real surprise.  Whether Arnold is galloping through a hotel on a horse or he's crashing into buildings with a jet or he's smashing dogs together by their heads, he looks in control because Cameron was in complete control.  What was shocking to me were the tender moments that Cameron was able to capture.  That interrogation room scene as well as Curtis's dance scene are two precise and appropriate sequences that elevate the film and give it a human feeling.  He found that humanity in `Titanic' three years later, but even still, what he does here surprised me.  When you factor in that he added so many wonderful layers of comedic perfection it makes the complete finished product all the more lovable.role.  He even emotes here, which I was shocked to see.

1400077915|4.0|The simple and everyday take on meaning and nuance in this collection of stories. Munro's style is dark, verging on maudlin, but she always seems to pull back at the right time so that the plots don't come off as completely overblown. The book's title takes its name from the introductory story that centers around a confused and weary runaway wife, but the better (to me) stories were the ones that followed, all of whom deal with the pathos of being female. If you're a woman between the ages of 20 and 65 you'll relate in some way.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This British production is of Jane Austen's final book. \\"Persuasion\\" was not published until after her death and Austen had written three alternative endings. This screenplay is as close to the book as any Austen production I have seen.     The film has a great feeling of authenticity and is the antithesis of the many Hollywood versions of her books. The characters are played by actors who have none of the glamour expected of film stars but all performances are very genuine. Together the cast create a truly enjoyable film of which, I can't help thinking, Jane Austen might have approved. It's still my favourite.

Dexter is funny, witty, smart, and full of surprises. Definately a show to watch if you have a wicked sense of humor and have always wanted to get revenge on all the evil in the world.
1591840562|4.0|The Art of the Start is well-organized, a quick, easy read, and every page has some useful tidbit of advice. Don't take it as literally as it sounds - there's no single formula for starting a company. But as a collection of thoughts and ideas, sage advice and simple tips, it's a fantastic read. I recommend it to anyone thinking of starting a business - inside or outside of an existing company.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Who hasn't thought what they would want to do if they had a chance to rid the world of true and unrepentant evil? Dexter does what people only think about. It is a dark comedy in all sense of the words. He is the ultimate anti-hero, you can't help but want him to suceed. From the first episode, you will be caught in Dexter's web. Michael C Hall pulls it off without a flaw. The supporting cast is incredible. You can't wait for more....
B001Y44F9S|4.0|There are worse things than living in Perfection, Nevada. For instance, thirty-foot-long burrowing man-eating worms with snake tongues.<br /><br />And sadly our heroes have both problems in \\"Tremors,\\" a dark-comedy/cult-horror flick that has no pretenses of being anything other than what it is -- a wonderfully twisted movie about big gross monsters that explode out of the ground if you step on it. Ron Underwood keeps the worm attacks going all the way to the end, along with splatters of monster gore, exploding floorboards, and lots of rock-paper-scissors.<br /><br />Hired-hands Earl (Fred Ward) and Val (Kevin Bacon) are intent on getting out of the sun-baked, dead-end town of Perfection, especially since they're the guys everyone hires for the grossest jobs.<br /><br />But then they encounter a pair of men who died under bizarre circumstances -- and when they rush back to warn the other citizens, a grotesque snake-creature is found on their truck. With the phone lines dead and the road blocked, Val and Earl try to ride horses to the nearest town -- only to discover that the snake-worm-thing is actually one of the tongues of a vast subterranean worm that sucks people down and eats them. Ew.<br /><br />With the help of grad student Rhonda (Finn Carter), the guys manage to elude the marauding worms and discover a foolproof way of staying out of their reach. Unfortunately staying indoors isn't enough to stop the worms: they're capable of detecting the slightest vibration, strong enough to rip the town apart, and smart enough to figure out a way. But how can Val and Earl get the Perfectionites out of the town without being eaten by worms? For this, they'll need a PLAN!<br /><br />\\"Tremors\\" is not a brilliant movie, nor is it a deep or groundbreaking one. It's just a thoroughly entertaining little movie about monstrous man-eating worms and how to avoid being eaten by them... which sounds like a rather dull concept for a movie.<br /><br />Fortunately Underwood has a fantastic sense of tension and suspense. At first, he drops in some wonderfully gruesome demises without actually showing the monster (jackhammer and orange blood! Buried station wagon!) and fakes out the audience with a \\"snake\\" on the axle. But when the graboids appear for real, all hell (pardon my French) breaks loose -- splatters of gore, some nasty deaths, vast ravenous worms, and a fun climax involving homemade bombs and (for once) a viable plan.<br /><br />What really sets it apart is the excellent writing (\\"Something to keep 'em busy, like a... like a decoy!\\" \\"Hey Melvin... wanna make a buck?\\"). Well, that and its extremely quirky sense of humor (money-savvy Chang setting up a \\"be photographed with the big gross worm\\" kiosk\\") -- you have to love how Earl and Val handle every problem, be it breakfast or suicide runs, by playing rock-paper-scissors. The only quirkiness that falls flat is the pole-vaulting scene.<br /><br />Bacon and Ward do an excellent job as a pair of very, very rural hired-hands who aspire to a better life (IE, not draining sewage tanks), and frankly their characters would be cartoonish or obnoxious in lesser hands. Carter makes a good down-to-earth love interest (\\"Why do you keep asking me?\\"), and Reba McIntyre and Michael Gross are absolutely brilliant as the kooky survivalists who are prepared for anything. Except graboids, of course.<br /><br />\\"Tremors\\" is a gloriously unpretentious little cult film, with many a confrontation between man and giant carnivorous burrowing worm.

B000JMKRKC|4.0|I liked this story well enough although not with the passion I have read others. I don't have any complaints really except one lingering doubt that will nag away at me until i put the story out of my head. Basically I never got one question answered... whose bones were buried?? I thought that was critical and unfortunately, not told.
031606792X|5.0|Ok, I'm a 56 year old woman but the Twilight books seem to appeal to all ages.  This last book of the series is the best, along with the first.  I couldn't relate to the movie but the books are great.  At work, we have women ages 25 to 60 reading them and we all love them!
B001PA0FFO|3.0|The story opens in 1964 in a neighborhood parish in the Bronx, where Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is the school principal.  She's tough and traditional and bristles at the friendlier, more outgoing attitude of the pastor, Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman).  A young teacher tells her that the priest may have acted inappropriately with one of her students, and Sister makes it her business to rid the parish of the dangerous man.<br /><br />This movie didn't live up to its hype for me.  I found the script dull and the actors competent, but not memorable.  The plot also draws upon the priest scandals of recent years and assumes guilt even though there is no evidence or trial.  There is no action at all and the overblown,  trite speeches lack real conviction.  I never believed Streep as the principal despite her scowls and knitted brows (and her accent that comes and goes); it all felt like play-acting.  Amy Adams is  way too saccharine and childlike as the young teacher.  I did like Hoffman as Father Flynn, however, and thought he did a good job of keeping us guessing.<br /><br />All in all, it seemed too stagy and tedious and ultimately pointless.  There were many things the Sister could and should have done with her suspicions but she did nothing except believe she was right.  It all  felt very unsatisfying to me.

B000QXDED6|2.0|Another mindless comics adaptation, which once again proves that comics that work very well for that medium, don't necessarily work in another.  The acting is bad in non-action scenes, and just posing in the fighting ones; the script is a mediocrity; some action scenes work well (in the post-Crouching Tiger/Matrix vein), but others don't, and none are realistic.  The cartoon violence and blood is bountiful indeed, but haven't we become numbed and dulled by now.  In order to shock or thrill, does each new action movie have to top the previous?  Certainly Kurusawa films STILL have more exciting and imaginatively shot scenes, with only a fraction of the blood.  And really, none of today's action flicks hold a candle to the use of balletic violence seen in the breakthrough films of Sam Peckinpah, Sergio Leone or even George Roy Hill's 'Butch cassidy and the Sundance Kid'.  Even though the violence of those films was decried and argued about for years, the point was never the violence itself, they protested violence (even while ironically celebrating it).  There was much violence for violence sake throughout the history of the movies, but rarely in big budget, or top studio projects, the gorey stuff usually used in horror, exploitation or Hong Kong martial arts flicks.  Today, these cinematic video games are the main fare of American movies!  I can't even compare a product like 300 (or the even worse 'Troy' or 'Alexander') to those clunky classical epics that Italy used to pump out (Hollywood too!).  Certainly 300 has more visceral \\"style\\", than those projects from the 50's and 60's, but there's little atmosphere, and the acting, plot and dialogue even worse.  This is certainly no 'Spartacus'.  If you want to see a much better film, a fantasy film full of graphic violence, but also with fine acting, dialogue, direction, photography, editing, costuming, music and non-CGI special effects, treat yourself to John Boorman's 1981 Arthurian epic, 'Excalibur' (and skip any of the recent Arthurian movies, and Beowulf).
B001IBIQU6|4.0|Almost thirty years and they continue to do new things! Traveling in new sounds without losing their foundation. Of all bands that are still trying, Depeche Mode is the only one that has achieved such success.<br /><br />Sounds Of The Universe is a mature album. A spiritual work ... With Depeche Mode's human side intact. Rich sounds. The production is beautiful! The letters with the same messages. An evolution for the new millennium.<br /><br />For the limited mental fans, one word: grow.
B001UOVP1S|4.0|I've been a fan since Louder Than Love.  At first I was disappointed in the style of music he's ventured into, but now after listening for a few days, I love this album! Some of his most singable songs I can remember.  Anybody who bashes this is closed minded and hasn't given it a fair chance.  You can't listen to a few seconds on Itunes and then ridicule.  I'm an even bigger fan because of this.  Not many, if any, artists can go 180 degrees like he has here.
B0015FHDRW|4.0|This is a good CD, easy to listen to and lots of fun, especially if you're a fan of 60s rock. The sound is reminsicent of the earlier Kinks and the songs cover just about every guitar riff from that era. The songs were even produced using 60s-vintage recording equipment to better capture the sound of that period. If you want a good rock CD, you'll like this, but if you're looking for a Green Day CD, you may be alittle disappointed.
B001RQ0SJO|5.0|UK songstress Natasha Khan, better known as Bat For Lashes, comes from the same line of females as Tori Amos, Bj&ouml;rk, Kate Bush, or PJ Harvey. \\"Two suns\\" is her sophomore disc, follow up to her Mercury prize nominated debut \\"Fur and gold\\".<br /><br />Opening cut \\"Glass\\" mentions the album title to insistent beats set against a sweeping New Age/Electro backdrop. She delicately weaves her breathy/desperate vocals around \\"Sleep alone\\", ranging from sultry lows to soprano highs against a throbbing soundscape.<br /><br />The piano-driven ballad \\"Moon and moon\\" has a goth feel, while \\"Daniel\\" is a gently cinematic song with viola over softly stomping beats. This is my favourite track.<br /><br />The mood throughout the album is dreamy and melancholic with her vocal histronics never stepping out of bounds. Every song is a standout really: \\"Peace of mind\\" (interesting vocal arrangements towards the end), the chiming \\"Siren song\\", the buzzing surreal-sounding \\"Pearl's dream\\", the breathy ethereal organ driven \\"Good love\\", the Bj&ouml;rk-like \\"Two planets\\" (with chiming bells, hand claps and insistent beats against a skeletal moody backdrop), the piano ballad \\"Travelling woman\\", and closing cut the piano ballad \\"The big sleep\\", a delicate duet with an Antony Hegarty-sounding Scott Walker.<br /><br />Intelligent lyrics set to simple, but catchy tunes. Stupendously stunning!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I ordered this with some hesitation as some of what has followed in the wake of the rising interest in all things Austen has been rather ugly.  I really enjoyed it though.  There was enough \\"real\\" Austen that you recognized the characters for who and what they were. Even when they deviated from the plot, it seemed to be quite in step with the way the characters had originally been written.  ****(spoiler alert) who couldn't believe it of Lizzie to want to head out on a big adventure in modern London ~ or that she would adapt very well once she found herself there?  To be honest, she was always way before her time in many ways.*****    Of course Darcy and Lizzy both were willing to do what \\"duty\\" called for -- but how much more fulfilling was the ending that was supplied.  There was also so much laughter and real affection between the characters (and who didn't love the water scene?)    I thought that this was just going to be my \\"girl\\" indulgence, but my husband and son actually joined me for the last two thirds of the movie and really liked it as well.  I am usually one who loves the idea of staying true to the book.  This is one of those examples that kept the spirit of the book - instead of the letter of the law (as it were.)    It was a wonderfully fun movie and I look forward to watching it again and again.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|\\"Sounds of the universe\\" is UK trio Depeche Mode's 12th studio effort, and I must say, it's my favourite after \\"Music for the masses\\". The new CD finds Dave Gahan doing more songwriting. Perhaps he grew more confident after his brilliant second solo disc \\"Hourglass\\". Whatever the reason, the results are truly great.<br /><br />Opening is the snarling \\"In chains\\", a sombre subdued affair. The synth-driven \\"Hole to feed\\" is glam rock, followed by lead-off single \\"Wrong\\", with Gahan singing how everything in his life was wrong.<br /><br />\\"Fragile tension\\" is more upbeat with grungey sounding guitars and melancholic synth strings, while the gentle \\"Little soul\\" is a dark-sounding ballad. Cranking up the tempo again is the buzzing \\"In sympathy\\", while the incredibly catchy \\"Peace\\" (a duet with Martin Gore) has an almost hymnal quality to it.<br /><br />\\"Come back\\" is a rather atmospheric ballad, while \\"Spacewalker\\" is an electro instrumental that could perfectly soundtrack \\"The X-Files\\". \\"Perfect\\" is another stirring ballad, while \\"Miles away/The truth is\\" with it's electronic buzzes and swirls is rather hypnotic. \\"Jezebel\\" is an erie sounding ballad with an almost Jazzy feel, and Martin Gore on vocals. Closing is the dark and sensual sounding \\"Corrupt\\".<br /><br />Much like fellow Brits the Pet Shop Boys' latest CD, Depeche Mode have managed to make another opus late into their career. Electro perfection!
B00012QM8G|5.0|This isn't much I can add to what hasn't been said or written some 15 years after this movies was released. It's still one of the most powerful stories ever put on film, mainly because it's based on fact. Since it's Hollywood, you don't know how much of this is true but the Holocaust certainly  is and that's enough. The little details don't matter when you're talking about killing thousands of people.    This movie features extremely good acting by the three leads: Liam Neson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley. Fiennes is particularly good as the Nazi villain.      Neeson's scene near the conclusion when he agonizes that \\"I could have done more,\\" is something all of us could say and probably will some day. That sentence by him haunts me after each viewing.    In addition to the moving story, the black-and-white cinematography in here is magnificent. Not many movies today are made in black-and-white and that's too bad because with today's cameras and knowledge, it can look tremendous. I hope this gets a sharp Blu-Ray treatment soon.    A lot of people would not watch this movie a second time and I can't blame them. It's tough to watch. There are some brutal, harrowing scenes in here with executions, naked people being led to the gas chambers....just some very disturbing stuff. It should be seen at least once, though, by everyone.

6305910340|5.0|Here's another one of those family-type stories that almost everyone likes because you care about the main character so much. In this case, it's a young boy, played very well by Max Pomeranc. It's also based on a true story which makes you care even more and root harder for the nice kid.    The idea of knocking pushy parents in kids' competition is fine but it's a little overworked here and you also get the normal PC angle in today's films where a black and white is concerned. In this film, it's Max's chess tutors. Those two teachers are the most interesting adults in here, but then again, where have you seen Ben Kingsley and Samuel L. Jackson NOT be entertaining?    Add Joe Mantegna and Joan Allen as the parents and you have a nice cast, along with an involving story and pretty nice photography. Interspersed in this story of a chess prodigy are film clips of the famous and very eccentric Bobby Fischer, whom the movie is named after. Young Pomeranc narrates those segments.    This was one of those truly solid \\"feel-good\\" movies of its year, which says a lot because 1993 produced an incredible amount of great pictures. Since it's so nicely-photographed, I'd like to see this get a good Blu-Ray treatment, too.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Walk the Line tells the story of Johnny Cash,one of the greatest musical legends of the 20th century.The film follows The Man in Black as he grows up/serves in the military/discovers music/falls into depression and then in love.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have wonderful on-screen chemistry and provide some of the most accurate voice and physical portrayals of the real music legends found on film to date.The cast,acting and cinematography are top-notch.Furthermore,the choice of songs performed by the actors during the film could not have been better.It should be said,however,that while this movie does chronicle most of Mr. Cash's life and show specific events that inspired some of his most famous songs,those looking for a History Channel style documentary need look elsewhere.All in all,Walk the line succeeds in telling one of the greatest stories in music history.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have given us a glimpse of these great musicians bound by love and music that will not be soon forgotten.If you are a musician or enjoy music in general than you should see this film.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I was glad to see this finally come out on DVD a few years ago because it's certainly deserving of a better transfer. As most people know, this is the story of World War I hero Alvin York, who went from drunken good-for-nothing to solid Christian man and war hero.    Gary Cooper was a great choice for the role. Few people in his era were better at playing modest, soft-spoken-but-manly heroes. When \\"York\\" makes no apology for his 100 percent belief in the Bible, no one challenges him because he's earned the respect from all, believers and non- believers. Cooper's status as an actor helps make that all the more \\"believable.\\" Sgt. York also gives one of the best examples of forgiveness I've ever seen on film.    Another nice feature of this movie is seeing Joan Leslie in the female lead. and Walter Brennan and Margaret Wycherly in supporting roles. I've always found those three to play interesting parts.    It was a shock to see a few things in this film. I'm just not used to seeing  true forgiveness, a hero citing Scripture, and military officers shown in a compassionate light (letting York, with his pacifistic views, decide what he anted to do).  What a shame so few films in the last 50 years have highlighted any of those values.  Thus, this is  a DVD to be treasured, particularly with all the features on this 2-disc Special Edition.
0385340990|5.0|Who says the epistolary novel is dead?  Although the letter format is old-fashioned, it absolutely works in this charming story, and I expect we'll see a revival of this eighteenth-century genre in the future.  (Please, no emails.  Not emails.)<br /><br />Think of this novel as \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran\\" meets \\"Island at War,\\" seasoned by a healthy dose of \\"84 Charing Cross Road.\\" The story, co-written by Mary Ann Shaffer and her niece Annie Barrows, takes place in 1946, as feisty thirty-something London author Juliet Ashton is picking up the pieces of her life after World War II.  Casting about for a subject for an article which morphs into her next book, she begins to correspond with several members of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society, an ad hoc book club formed in the Channel Islands during the five long years of German occupation.<br /><br />As they write to Juliet,the society members reveal both the hilarity and the horror of the war.  Juliet decides she can't get the full story unless she travels to Guernsey to interview these survivors, and of course falls in love with the people and the place and stays far longer than she intends.  There is a bit of a love triangle between Juliet, a London rake, and a shy but proud Guernsey farmer named Mr. Darcy -- er, Dawsey.  Sound familiar? But Jane Austen is not the only great writer whose work is honored here: Charles Lamb, Seneca, Oscar Wilde, Marcus Aurelius, Geoffrey Chaucer, the Bronte sisters, and others pop up like old friends.  If there is a theme to this story, it's that great books--and good friends--can get you through anything.  As one character says, \\"We clung to books and to our friends; they reminded us that we had another part to us.\\"<br /><br />Not only did I love this novel; it gave me Reader Rabbit trails to follow for months. It's chock full of enough literary recommendations for other novels, essays, and stories to keep bibliophiles busy.  This is precisely what Juliet loves about reading: \\"...one tiny thing will interest you in a book, and that tiny thing will lead you onto another book, and another bit there will lead you onto a third book.  It's geometrically progressive--all with no end in sight, and for no other reason than sheer enjoyment.\\"will interest you in a book, and that tiny thing will lead you onto another book, and another bit there will lead you onto a third book.

B001YV506S|5.0|This is a very good movie. I realize that, but Laura Hillenbrand's book, from which this movie is taken, is hands-down the best sports book I have ever read. So, I eagerly anticipated the movie. I found out what so many other people discovered when their favorite book was made into a film: it can't live up to it. In fairness, no two-hour film can do justice to a good book.    In this case, there were many things the jockey, owner and trainer went through that made the story so compelling, and they weren't in the movie. I won't detail them. Just read the book. But you can't appreciate what these men and that gutsy racehorse really accomplished just by the film. It only scratches the surface.    Having said all that, I enjoy this film  more and more with each viewing.  The movie's strength was its beauty, just magnificently filmed. Man, this is a gorgeous film, from the first shot to the last. Director Gary Ross and Director Of Photography John Schwartzman put a lot of loving care into this film and it shows. The actors were fine, too. No complaints there.    I'm anxious to see this on Blu-Ray, which is scheduled to be released at the end of May, 2009.
B001RTP48G|4.0|They had theit hits in the 80s, when everything was pretty much a novelty. The Pet Shop Boys added to that curio-laden era.  They've never been away,  but the last couple of albums never seemed to have that spark that earlier material seemed to have.  To some people, the duo's last studio release \\"Fundamental\\" suffered slightly due to political subject matter.  Having such a reputation as great musicians, it allows the Pet Shop Boys to call upon other musical geniuses to work on their album.  Johnny Marr who was in a band called the Smiths was called in to work his magic on guitar arrangements. Owen Pallett, who is well known amongst Arcade Fire fans, also lends a hand to work on various string sections. And Philip Oakey ( Human League) helps the proceedings as well.  For their 10th outing, Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe have hooked up with hitmaking production team Xenomania in an attempt to return to core values and reaffirm their pop relevance.  Thankfully, collaborating with Xenomania, the pop production house behind hits from Girls Aloud and Alesha Dixon, hasn't goaded the Pets into trying anything undignified. \\"Yes\\" sounds clean, fresh and contemporary.  It all starts promisingly: \\"All Over The World\\" samples a nutcracking snatch of Tchaikovsky to deliver a grand, mordant hymn to global pop songs and everyday desires.  But the heart of the album lies in more low-key numbers such as  the slightly delirious \\"Pandemonium\\",  \\"King Of Rome\\", an exquisite tale of post-break-up loneliness, and  the tortured  melody of \\"Legacy\\",  inspired by Tony Blair, which recall the windblown balladry of 1990's \\"Behaviour\\".  Maybe the characteristically titled \\"The Way It Used To Be\\" - is about a once brilliant love that disintegrates over time -  is one of the best thing here, defiantly struggling against easy nostalgia,  along with the gorgeous, string-filled 1960s fantasy which is \\"Beautiful People\\" with its  flamboyant Bacharach and David-like stylings.  It's a bunch of joyous pop songs. The real pop feasts are in the first half of the album . Although they are well received, nothing major ever surfaced to get people excited like the first single  \\"Love Etc.\\" Complete with a mesmerising animated video, it caught the balance perfectly of synth pop without being too sickly sweet.  \\"Yes\\" isn't perfect. \\"Does the union of Pet Shop Boys and Xenomania work as well on record as it does on paper? Are the middle-aged Tennant and Lowe, now in their 25th year as a hit-making duo, relevant in today's musical landscape? Will lapsed fans who enjoyed their triumphant performance at last month's Brit Awards find plenty to enjoy here? For the answer to all those questions, you need only glance at the album cover\\". - Nick Levine.  If \\"Yes\\" doesn't do well, there can be no such excuses. The timing couldn't be better for a Pet Shop Boys comeback, after all - synthpop is, inescapably, the sound of 2009.  Some people may say, at the end of the listening, that the CD is a little too predictable and boring, and that it's just their past legacy that continually keeps their fan-dom alive.  Well, certainly their achievements are not without merit in any way and the recent Brits award is a clear proof.
B000ICM5MG|4.0|After not seeing this film since it had come out in the theaters in 1976, I was almost shocked at how little action this movie had compared to what you see today....or in the Rocky sequels, for that matter.    That's fine. It was needed to give us character studies of the main players: Rocky, his wife, his brother, his manager, etc., people we would see in subsequent films. Also, the fight scenes in those sequels went on too long, anyway. Frankly, I've enjoyed all the Rocky movies, beginning with this one.    In this film, the romance between \\"Rocky Balboa\\" (Sylvester Stallone) and \\"Adrian\\" (Talia Shire) was a major subplot to the boxing saga. It reminded me a bit of the '50s film with Paul Newman, \\"Somebody Up There Likes Me.\\" If you enjoyed this movie, check that classic film out.    The DVD transfer of this 2-disc Collector's Edition is excellent, especially considering the movie is almost 35 years old.
1595141715|4.0|I saw this book and actually read it as a parent before giving it to my teenage daughter.  It's a well-written story that really makes you think about how your actions and words affect others.  I would recommend this to parents and their teenagers (over 14 or 15 years)and discuss the ramifications of hurtful words and actions.
B000OPOAJS|3.0|I actually saw Ronin in the theater when I was in high school.  I had no idea what to expect, but I ended up loving it.  It had such a great sense of style, it didn't spoon feed the plot to you, and featured fantastic action scenes.  To this day it has my favorite car chase scenes.<br /><br />So when I heard it was coming out on Blu-Ray, I was excited.  I love the high definition picture and high quality sound that Blu-Ray offers, as well as the ability to fit those and a slew of extras on a single disc.<br /><br />Unfortunately, MGM/Fox decided to treat this great movie poorly for its Blu-Ray debut.  The picture quality is improved, but not up to par with the more impressive Blu-Ray catalog releases we've seen so far.  It is a single-layered release (using only 25GB of the 50GB available on a dual-layered disc), and uses a compression codec (MPEG-2) that has largely been abandoned in favor of better ones.<br /><br />Worse, all the great extras from both DVDs are absent from the Blu-Ray.  Even the original DVD from 1999(!) had a commentary and alternate ending.  The 2006 DVD had those, a documentary, and a bunch of featurettes.<br /><br />All in all, this Blu-Ray takes one baby-step forward, and several big steps backward.  This disc is behind the DVD that is 10 years its senior.  Sadly I'll be waiting to purchase this until MGM treats this movie with the respect it deserves (the respect they gave it 3 years ago).
B001PPLIEG|3.0|I've waited until I have watched this a few times to review so I didn't just blurt out a first impression.<br />Repeated viewing improves it slightly but this still fails to rise above the average.<br />Casino Royale was very good, it re-booted the franchise and gave us a great new Bond and QOS needed to be a little more then just a follow up, having 're-booted' it would have nice to have got back to the slightly over the top stuff that is the essence of James Bond.<br />A bad start with QOS with the worst intro song of the entire series and then we are straight into the action. The action and fight scenes are gritty but the camera work is so quick at times you don't know what the Hell is going on. Although Craig and Dench are both on top form, nobody else really stands out with the main bad guy being very insipid.<br />There is a plot, but when you boil it down it is not that clever and the final sequence, stuck in a building in the middle of the desert, was far too obvious and by the numbers - you knew it was going to blow up as soon as one of the bad guys mentioned his concern about the fuel there!<br />No real stand out moments in what is a functional but not great Bond film. Of course Bourne, 24, XXX and so on have raised expectations but Bond has a unique market position and the film-makers need to remember this.
0930289234|2.0|I was interesed in seeing the movie. The reviews sounded interesting so I thought I'd read the book first. And with reviews like, \\"The greatest piece of popular fiction ever produced\\" and \\"One of Time magazine's 100 best novels\\" on the cover, how could I go wrong?<br /><br />I dabble in comics. I read the big collections. I have no figurines, no stickers on my car. I see the movies, but usually on DVD. I own precious few comic books, mostly borrowing what I read from friends or the library.<br /><br />On the other hand, I am a voracious reader. This is my 721st review and I like to think that I know a little about books.<br /><br />I appreciate the fact that this book was groundbreaking in its day. It offered a bleak, jaded and, frankly, more realistic look at the whole concept of superheroes. When it asks, \\"Who watches the watchmen?\\" that is an important question.<br /><br />Showing the Comedian committing atrocities in Vietnam is a nice twist on those Superman cartoon movies that show Superman fighting the Germans. Showing an all-powerful Dr. Manhattan literally not caring about the little people is an interesting but barely explored theme - what happens when the superhero realizes he doesn't care about the little people anymore because he is not one of them?<br /><br />But, the relentless dark nature of the book and the insistence on highlighting nearly every single watchman with his or her own volume just wore me down. I lost interest with the volume on Dr. Manhattan. He's just plain old boring. The parts that concern him feel like they were written by an unsure college freshman who is trying to sound philosophical. Tedious is more like it.  Rorschach is interesting and along with the Owl their combination of cool tools and psychological disfunction comprise the modern-day incarnation of Frank Miller's vision of Batman in [[ASIN:1563893428 Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]. Laurie is interesting, to a point.<br /><br />Veidt is tedious because his plan to unite humanity has no basis in history, which is a real hoot - the smartest man in the world does not know the history he claims to have studied? Invasions from aliens have happened, figuratively, of course. The Persians caused the Spartans and Athenians to unite. But, in two generations the Spartans worked with Persians to defeat the Athenians. Cortes had the help of several Indian groups to defeat the Aztecs. American Indian groups worked with the United States government to subdue other groups. This plan is comic booking at its worst - adolescent political theory applied to a big picture idea.<br /><br />Anyway, I won't be seeing the movie. I skimmed the end of the book. I'm glad the Owl gets the girl. Good for him, at least someone got something out of this overly-pretentious, overly-hyped read.humanity has no basis in history, which is a real hoot - the smartest man in the world does not know the history he claims to have studied?

B001PA0FFO|5.0|The only thing I can with certainty about John Patrick Shanley's \\"Doubt\\" is that it makes the grade for the best film of 2008.  Everything else is sort of up in the air, as I'm sure this playwright turned director would have it.<br /><br />Set in a Catholic School in 1964, right around the same time of Vatican II, one could make a good case that despite being set in an atmosphere of faith this is a perfect movie for an agnostic or a lapsed Catholic.  A really anguished agnostic and lapsed Catholic.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffmann plays Father Brendan Flynn in one of the most exquisitely ambiguous performances I have ever seen.  His character is seen, indeed, \\"through a glass darkly\\" though despite the ambiguity I don't think any viewer can come away without feeling a little slime rub off.  What is the exact nature of the slime?  Is it shame over a different sexual orientation?  Or is he in fact what the hawk-like, steely Sister Alyosisus suspects him to be: a sexual predator?<br /><br />While Meryl Streep gave a very entertaining performance as the classic Nunzilla, she wasn't really as bad as many viewers of the film hyped her up to be.  I've had more frightening teachers than that in public school.<br />Having attended Catholic school nearly my entire life, I can say that \\"living in terror of priests and nuns\\" is, by and large, a myth.  There was some discipline involved, but I don't walk around crying about it decades later.<br /><br />Though she laments the increasing use of ballpoint pens, transistor radios, and progress in general, she obviously has a heart.<br />Always eager to assist Sister Veronica, an aging fellow nun who is slowly blinding,  and patient with the starry eyed Sister James (Amy Adams).  There a few moments of absolute frigidity that occur mostly when her Absolutist nature is disturbed (telling Donald's mother that she will kick the child out if she does up her unfounded allegations against Father Flynn.)  When Father Flynn suggests \\"secular\\" songs for the Christmas pageant, she becomes really chilling, insisting that \\"Frosty The Snowman\\"  is a disgusting piece of pagan heresy.  Also, Frosty should be known as a heretic and it should be broadcast all over the airwaves during Christmas.<br /><br />There's obviously a lot of resentment on Shanley's part regarding the patriarchal nature of the Church.  When Sister Aloysius and Sister James confront Father Flynn their suspicions about his relationship with the only black student in the school, Donald Miller, he sets the tone very authoritatively by strongly \\"suggesting\\" they put sugar in his tea.  His explanation for Donald's absence and the alcohol on his breath is believable.  All too believable.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie in which you have to weigh and balance every word, every nuance, and understand the symbolism if you want to get to the root of it.  Personally, I got the very strong sense that Shanley is playing both sides to evoke a sense of justice: while Father Flynn represents progressivism and Vatican II, he is very probably a child molester.  On the other hand Sister Aloysius represents the desire for female liberation and absolute Conservatism at the same time, which is merely an unresolved complex and not appealing to most viewers at all.  But out of the two of them, she is the righteous one.  This movie has to be seen more than once.  A masterpiece.he becomes really chilling, insisting that \\"Frosty The Snowman\\"  is a disgusting piece of pagan heresy.

B001TOD92C|5.0|Mickey Rourke's triumphant return! `THE WRESTLER' is magnificently real, edgy and easily one of the best films to come out in theaters in 2009 thus far!  Rourke is just amazing in this film!<br /><br />\\"THE WRESTLER\\", a 2008 film (released in theaters in Jan. 2009) had faced a good number of challenges during its planning and production.  Under the constant constraints of trying to get financing and setting a budget and a film finding the right talent that would be perfect for a certain role was indeed a challenge<br /><br />Fortunately, the film was well-cast and well written, \\"THE WRESTLER\\" definitely succeeds under the wonderful guidance of Director Darren Aronofsky (\\"Requiem for a Dream\\", \\"The Fountain\\", etc.) and a convincing storyline by Robert D. Siegel.  Magnificent performances by Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood!<br /><br />\\"THE WRESTLER\\" is a film about consequences and the moment.  Showcasing the dark side of professional wrestling, it definitely gives us a perspective of knowing that Randy's story is just among the number of wrestlers...old and new, who faces aging, trying to keep fit and doing what they can to get them prepared for the ring, even if it may kill them.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"THE WRESTLER\\" single-disc DVD is presented in widescreen format 2.35:1 aspect ratio with English 5.1 Dolby Surround.  Picture quality is quite decent on DVD but I'm sure that a film with this much action in the ring should look much more better in High Definition.  But on DVD, it looks as if the film had a lot of grain but granted, the film was shot using 16mm<br /><br />As for the audio, \\"THE WRESTLER\\" is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Surround, the audience cheering and the constant blasts of 80's rock music from Quiet Riot, RATT and other 80's rock bands with music that definitely comes out strong through the front channels.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />The following special features for \\"THE WRESTLER\\" are included:<br /><br />  * Within the Ring featurette - (42:44) An indepth featurette with interviews with the Director and producers of \\"THE WRESTLER\\" discussing their challenges the film faced, budget problems but working with the various talent and how this story is not to far off from the lives of real professional wrestlers.<br />  * The Wrestler Music Video - Written and Performed by Bruce Springsteen - (3:59)  A music video featuring Bruce Springsteen performing in the middle of a wrestling ring and clips from the movie.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"THE WRESTLER\\" is just a powerful film and I have to credit that to the performance of Mickey Rourke.  The amount of work to get his body so toned and muscular is quite impressive but the overall screenplay and level of direction really made this film feel genuine.  I was very surprised of how much bulking up he had to do in order to play the character of Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson.  But you can't deny that Rourke looked perfect for the role and his portrayal of a man who's lost was just magnificent.<br /><br />I don't know if any other actor could have really pulled it off.  Rourke's determination and how he owned this role is just brilliant and he was definitely deserving of an Academy Award nomination.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei also had an Academy Award-caliber performance and she looked absolutely great in this film.  Definitely a role that I would never have pictured her for, but nevertheless, she did great.<br /><br />And Evan Rachel Wood, as the estranged daughter, she definitely brought the emotional element between father and daughter and how messed up things truly are between them.  Another fine performance for Wood, who was absolutely wonderful in her last film \\"Across the Universe\\".<br /><br />What makes \\"THE WRESTLER\\" work so well is its layers of believability.  The character living in a trailer park, the character of Randy still tries to live in his past relishing on the good years of when he was one of the mostpopular wrestlers. His mannerisms of dying his hair to continually working his various odd jobs.  He loves it when people listen to his wrestling war stories about his injuries, having the neighbor kids come over to play old school NES (with his character) and having fans and wrestlers continue to support him.  But knowing outside of his life and the persona he has lived, his life is just in shambles.<br /><br />What is very sad about this film, although the storyline features the life of one wrestler, is to know that in reality, Randy's life is a life that many professional wrestlers have lived.  Unlike other sports where an athlete can retire, many of these wrestlers in the 80's did not have the big money contracts of today, nor did they have film offers and aside from Hulk Hogan, the truth is that a good number of the pro wrestlers from yesteryear are poor, wrestling to survive and like the character of Randy, estranged from their own family members, abuse steroids, pain medications or drugs and having to wrestle to survive.<br /><br />How far these athletes will go to earn a paycheck which includes having their bodies battered decades after their prime as a top wrestler.  No health insurance for these aged wrestlers and what money is made from one wrestling match, would have to be spent in a hotel/motel in another state or city and really, are not in a good position to continually save. So, basically when they are in the ring, they are relying on their own wrestling smarts but if they get hurt or injured, it's on their backs and thus many use drugs or painkillers for their pain.<br /><br />Where a film such as \\"BEYOND THE MAT\\" showed to wrestling fans a realistic and dark and downside of professional wrestling, \\"THE WRESTLER\\" is obviously a film that has more visibility and will expose people to this side of life of pro wrestlers and thanks to its Academy Award  and critically-acclaimed hype (which is definitely warranted), I hope people give this film a try.<br /><br />Overall, I was really impressed with the film and how well emotions were captured.  And again, magnificent performances from Rourke, Tomei and Wood.<br /><br />\\"THE WRESTLER\\" is definitely recommended on DVD or Blu-ray!ople listen to his wrestling war stories about his injuries, having the neighbor kids come over to play old school NES (with his character) and having fans and wrestlers continue to support him.

B001RTP48Q|5.0|Pet Shop Boys always release good stuff, but 'Yes' easily surpasses anything they've done since 1993's masterful 'Very.' It's all here: expansive melodies, indelible hooks, shimmering production. There are any number of potential singles on 'Yes' (\\"Love Etc.\\" was a great place to start), though album tracks such as \\"King of Rome\\" and \\"Legacy\\" are no less rewarding than the more radio-friendly cuts.  These boys are now in their fifties, but the music they create remains fresh and vital.
B001R4KQDE|5.0|Frank Miller's \\"SIN CITY\\" graphic novels released back in 1991 and 1992 wowed readers when it first was released from Dark Horse Comics.  The stories were collected in trade paperbacks with seven graphic novel that revolve around the people of Basin City aka \\"Sin City\\".  Known for it's use of primary colors of black, white and red, the graphic novel would win many fans over for its dark and violent tone but storytelling crafted by Frank Miller known for his awesome work on the \\"Batman\\" and \\"Daredevil: The Man Without Fear\\" comic books.<br /><br />In 2005, Robert Rodriguez, a fan of the graphic novels wanted to make a film based on \\"SIN CITY\\" but if only Frank Miller jumped on aboard.  After seeing test footage by Frank Miller, it was enough to entice the creator to become co-director of the film and in the end, earned over $158 million worldwide in theater receipts.<br /><br />In 2005, two DVD versions were released and now, a special 2-disc Blu-ray version which includes the original theatrical and the \\"recut, extended, unrated\\" version is set for an April 21, 2009 and all I can say is that this release blows away the DVD versions and easily among the top 10, if not, the top 5 Blu-ray's produced thus far.<br /><br />So, does \\"Frank Miller's SIN CITY\\" achieve perfection on Blu-ray?  Read on.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Frank Miller's SIN CITY\\" is a film that is shot entirely digital via green screen.  The digital recreations of Sin City just look dark, grimy but in a technical sense, quite magnificent in capturing Frank Miller's dark and corrupted city with its blacks, whites and reds.<br /><br />The video which is presented in 1080p (with an aspect ratio of 1:85:1) is just absolutely beautiful as you can see skin pores to absolute detail on the talent but what is more impressive is how digital and realism comes together in harmony.  What was more shocking (which you learn from the special features), in certain scenes which you thought talent were acting with other talent, they weren't.  Footage of an actor may have been shot eight months ago and then the character that is interacting with another character is shot much later and all work done in post-production.<br /><br />A perfect example is in \\"That Yellow Bastard (Part 2)\\" in which Shellie (Brittany Murphy) and Hartigan (Bruce Willis) are interacting but in reality, the two individual scenes were shot months from each other.  It's just amazing how everything seems so fluid.<br /><br />The picture quality is just magnificent.  It's one thing to watch this on DVD and say how beautiful the film looks but when you watch it and see it on High Definition, it just blows away the picture quality of the DVD.  Granted, this film doesn't have as many colors as top tier Blu-ray films such as \\"Transformers\\" or even \\"Quantum of Solace\\" but using the dark grays and blacks with the whites and reds, this film looks great.<br /><br />As for audio, again this Blu-ray release meets perfection.  The English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48kHz/24-bit) is just incredible.  From the action scenes to the engines of the cars, you literally feel the noise around you.  And at the end with Alba and Willis's character, nice touch of the low level bass as your subwoofer just beats.  The audio is just great to listen to and the clarity of the dialogue, music and special effects were well done.<br /><br />If you think the theatrical and even the unrated, recut edition sound good, there is also an audio track to listen to a live recording of the audience at the Texas premiere which sounds great too (I can only hope more Blu-ray releases include that feature).<br /><br />Overall, \\"Frank Miller's SIN CITY\\" achieves perfection for picture and audio quality.  Just magnificent!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />With Audio and Video reaching perfection, this Blu-ray release does not slouch in special features at all.  You are definitely getting your money's worth with so many features included.  Features such as:<br /><br />DISC 1: Disc One (Theatrical Cut) Features: This disc gives you five different reasons to re-watch the original theatrical version of the film and all are worth it!<br /><br />  * All new Cine-Explore - Innovative Blu-ray technology allows viewers to experience a uniquely interactive visual commentary that pushes the envelope. When selected, see picture-in-picture green screen footage and original art synced with the filmmakers' commentary.  This is optional and a nice touch.<br />  * 2.0 Commentary with Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller - The commentary between Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller is pretty cool. Miller has lived \\"SIN CITY\\", he knows the ins and outs to the city and its characters, so it was great to have this commentary with both men.  But mostly for Miller's perspective and knowledge.  Very cool commentary.<br />  * 2.0 Commentary with Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino - Tarentino shot the burial/driving scene for \\"The BIG FAT KILL\\", so he's pretty much in and out for the commentary.  Most of the commentary is Robert Rodriguez.  Where the first commentary, it was Miller driven, this one is Rodriguez driven and when the the time comes, you hear Tarentino chime in.  But it's an interesting commentary as Tarantino doesn't like shooting in digital but because it's a Frank Miller film based on a popular Frank Miller story, he gave it a chance and enjoyed the experience.<br />  * 5.1 Audio Track Featuring a Recording of the Austin Audience Reaction - Definitely a fun addition as you watch the film with the actual audience track with people cheering, laughing and just reactions during the entire film.  Sounds great and really gave me another reason to watch the film again and enjoy it.  Great addition to this release!<br /><br />DISC TWO:  This disc includes the \\"Unrated, Recut Extended Version\\" which has 23 extra minutes and the bulk of the special features.<br /><br />  * All new \\"Kill `em Good\\" Interactive Comic Book - Dive into a visually stunning interactive game that puts you in the driver's seat. Exploiting the Blu-ray format in ways never before seen, you finish the story - with guns blazing!  For a game, I was quite impressed by the audio quality.  Very well done game and using the graphic novels and artwork for an interactive comic book.  Very nice addition to this Blu-ray release!<br />  * Four Chapters: The unrated, recut version are viewed as separate films.  There are no chapter stops, so you can watch these separate chapters with new, additional footage.<br /><br />o Chapter One- That Yellow Bastard<br /><br />o Chapter Two- The Customer Is Always Right<br /><br />o Chapter Three- The Hard Goodbye<br /><br />o Chapter Four- The Big Fat Kill<br /><br />  * Rodriguez Special Features:<br /><br />o 15-Minute Film School - (15 min.) Robert Rodriguez is known for his past DVD releases of teaching the filmmaker of tips of how he accomplished scenes on a budget.  This time around, Rodriguez uses \\"SIN CITY\\" to show how things are done via green screen but how he did certain things to stay within budget of the film.<br /><br />o All Green Screen Version - (12:33) This is the entire film sped up in 800% but a good way to see how everything was shot via green screen.<br />o The Long Take - (14:42) This scene shows how Quentin Tarentino shot the driving scene between Dwight (Clive Owen) and Jackie Boy (Benicio del Toro).  Very interesting how this take is long and these guys are just sitting in the car for long periods of time. Interesting perspective on filmmaking with these two talented individuals.<br />o Sin City: Live in Concert- (7:15) During a break in Texas, Bruce Willis & The Accelerators perform for charity and cast of \\"Frank Miller's SIN CITY\\" and \\"Scanner Darkly\\" hook up and enjoy the performance.<br />o 10-Minute Cooking School - (6:21) Director Robert Rodriguez is often working late in the early morning and when he gets the munchies, he loves his breakfast tacos.  So, heshows you how to make them.<br /><br />* How It Went Down: Convincing Frank Miller To Make The Film - (5:40) What it took for Robert Rodriguez to convince Frank Miller to make \\"SIN CITY\\" to a movie.  Interviews with both men.<br />* Special Guest Director: Quentin Tarantino - (7:19) Interviews with Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez.  How Rodriguez was able to convince Tarantino to direct a spot.<br />* A Hard Top With A Decent Engine: The Cars of Sin City - (7:34) Interviews with Cecil D. Evans (Transportation Coordinator) of finding the vehicles from the graphic novels for the film.  Miller owns hundreds of die cast vehicles and used those as reference for his graphic novels.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Any negative comments written on this has no merit.  This was absolutely wonderful.  Phase 1 then Phase 2 then phase 3 and each phase getting harder.  It is not too hard for a beginner and it allows you to take your time moving along each phase.  They even have a peson in the back ground showing you are to do the workout that Jillian is doing and a scaled back manner in case you are having a hard time.  What more can one say.  Excellent.
B00008V5VN|4.0|Having just heard the 52-minute Jerusalem version on XM Radio, my first thoughts were, \\"If only there was a longer version to give me a chance to really get into it.\\"  And as if my prayers were answered, a 63-minute version.      But what I was really hoping for was like a 24-hour version with even less variety... just kidding... give me Master of Puppets any day!
0060594896|5.0|An absolutely must read. For the most part, I only buy books after I check them out from the library and read them first and find that it is worth buying and keeping for future generations. This was one of those.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|These things are fantastic. They look a little awkward at first, but its not about looks. Soon as you put your hand on your controller you'll be asking yourself why this wasn't the way the controller was designed in the first place. These trigger add-ons are extremely easy to install and make a HUGE difference in the playability of the R2 and L2 triggers. A must have item for the PS3 gamer.
0743298039|5.0|This novel has a wonderful sense of old-fashioned mystery, as well as a finely developed plot that consistently delivers steady doses of new intrigue, keeping the reader bouncing back and forth between two worlds that are occupied by Vida Winter's past and Margaret Lea's present.  Fabulous plot twist, vivid attention to detail, quirky main characters and a study of the human relationship, this novel is a satisfying read.  A nice balance of catering to both the reader who loves a good story and the reader who loves to think outside the box.
B000OVLBHG|4.0|This is a review of the first movie of Starship Troopers.    Excellent parity of war and governments. Ironically it came out before the Iraq war.    Dina Meyer was nice enough to show her top in a coed shower. Just wish Denise Richards did not wait till later movies to show her top.
6305897786|5.0|The Ninth Gate was a wonderful four to five star film by Roman Polanski starring Johnny Depp and Frank Langella. It was a well paced film which metered out horror at a deliberately measured pace.  Direction and casting were all superb. Johnny Depp's performance was outstanding as a totally amoral book dealer on a mission to find none other than Lucifer himself.<br /><br />Many scenes contained fantastic imagry and appear to have been filmed on location. The final scenes were surprising and left me feeling a bit unfinished.  Then again, this ending (as in Rosemarie's Baby) left the viewer very interested in what happens next and several directors believe that a good way to go.  In any case, I really enjoyed this film and recommend it to all fans of Roman Polanski and Johnny Depp.
B000001F45|5.0|So I'm young, at least I like it/not hate it!(some say \\"38\\" ain't young or old)  In fact, I love it!  I know someone named Lorraine and the track kind of got my attention lyric wise. So I listened(Pink top 1976) these guys are incredibly better than music I preivously thought incredible(Rush, Floyd, UFO, ect) though eccentric, the music is talented with an eccentric lead singer.  Though David Byron's mic(not the man's singing) sucked in the concert, I heard this in the original recording and he sounds sharper and more cutting then that conecert, probably some tech glytch in the microphone.  Why did Ken Hensly get a superior mic?  A good organist though he is! The drummer is incredible in the concerts as is the organist.  The gitar/bass play in differing medolic/rythmns. In an interview, the group said thier concerts are more flippent and vigorous than thier bluesy albumns, yet I like it that way!  I do prefer Byron's voice on the albumns. Other tracks are just as incredible usually the gitar player(either Mick Box or Ken Hensly who plays it differnt) gets my attention especially \\"Spider woman\\" and mostly the distinct bass gitar playing in soulful upper end in the rest of these tracks(and in Sweet Lorraine) on par with the late sixties/early seventies(though rarely) also in the nineties one can develope a taste for bass listening and playing it if one listens to this wonderful \\"Ear candy\\" as someone pointed out.  Usually a blues element, the upper ended style(still referring to Gary Thain's bass gitar playing) is used in a lot of(real) rock and roll of this decade.  Lee Kerslake's percussive element is so fast as to seem to blend to one noise(as the front end of a car's engine in high RPM, w/o exhaust pipe sound) but you only notice his energy in concerts.  The albumns are more precice/less tempo. More drum element though.  If you have liked classic rock since teen hood(even if your young) you can adapt quickly and enjoy, if you don't(and this is in reference to what other people have said) Ken's heavy organ music will overwhelm you. You need to develope a taste for experimental music like this to like it at all!(like dark dark beer or something) When I was a kid I couldn't have.  Yes's Tony Kaye got me interested in Organ music when I was 21.  Geddy Lee in bass when I was nineteen or something. that was nearly 20 years ago!  Took long to develope a liking to music with such heavy elements of instrumentalists.other people have said) Ken's heavy organ music will overwhelm you.

B001IBIQU6|5.0|I pre-ordered SOTU & haven't received it yet, so I went ahead & downloaded it on here (too anxious, couldn't wait) - and I must say, it's worth every penny! I'm already in love with it. One of the things I love about Depeche is that there's never any filler on their albums, every track stands out on its own.       Depeche Mode has been one of my favorite bands for ages and still continue to amaze me. I have all their albums and trust me, this one is up there with the best of the lot. It's even better than their last album, Playing the Angel - which was the tops itself.     This band defiantly keeps getting better & better, I hope they keep making records for as long as possible.
B0013D8LCW|4.0|\\"Shelter\\" has a lot going for it.  An interesting and credible screenplay, an attractive and professional cast, some excellent surfing action footage and impressive outdoor settings.  Most of all, it succeeds in establishing characters that the viewer comes to care about a great deal.  The story goes well beyond some of the usual gay coming of age genre flicks.  It avoids soft porn titillation and sexual fantasy in favor of presenting the developing affection between the two lead characters--Zach and Shaun.  And it does not pretend that there are not other things going on in those characters' lives.  In the case of Zach, a major load of family obligations while facing of a bleak future.<br /><br />The film also demonstrates--pretty accurately in California, at least--the transition from rejection to unconditional acceptance that gay and lesbian people are seeing these days.  The unquestioning reassurance that best friend Gabe (Shaun's brother) gives to Zach is touching and, I think, not unrealistic for that generation.  This is repeated later by Torrey, Zach's girlfriend.  This kind of acceptance was unimaginable for most gay people 20 or even 15 years ago.  It is extremely touching and gratifying to see it expressed now.<br /><br />\\"Shelter\\" is a very good indie film that fully deserves its apparent success.  There have been many gay genre films that have covered the same material but without the skill and sensitivity that are present in this film.  \\"Shelter\\" sets a kind of standard that I hope will be regularly exceeded in the future as gay-themed stories receive the kind of mainstream production that they might deserve.

1592402690|4.0|I think this is a good book for recording artists and for bands as well as Beatle fans. Emerick brought up another angle to what broke up The Beatles - the trip to India, but he talks about the \\"Revolver\\" sessions as the first sign of problems. He also mentions the \\"Abbey Road\\" cover as the band walking away from a building they despised by that time.     I think this was also about the amount of credit George Martin has gotten over the years as being a great producer and Emerick wanting to let the world know what he did (and Elvis Costello, who wrote the foreward). Emerick was the one who had to figure ways around EMI's strict policies and give The Beatles what they wanted, even though it could have cost him his job.     I also think he did a decent job as presenting them as people and not icons, but kept at a professional distance. He comes across as someone who felt unappreciated and overworked at their peak because he just about fulfilled every idea they wanted to put on vinyl, but when he left for a while, it does come across that he was integral. Considering he'd work with them on solo projects and an in demand engineer for other bands, it's a valid statement. And even though he complains about George Martin taking all the credit, Martin also opened the position for him when he left EMI.     But when you hear about rock bands taking years trying to make the best album ever, when you read how \\"Pepper\\" was made, it wasn't about just getting every note right, but getting the perfect feel.     He does criticize the band's personalities (except Paul's), and I think his issue with Ringo was tied to one of the things that brought the recording studio to an end. And with that \\"peace and love, no more autographs\\" comment, what Geoff says about Ringo in the book isn't a surprise. And no mention of things getting that out of hand in the studio, except the part about a stolen biscuit.     But this book has given a pretty clear account of what may have caused the breakup better than most books. He doesn't let Paul off the hook, or say Yoko was the reason.  But you do see the change in personalities after the India trip, but as mentioned in other Beatle books, Alex is an unwanted presence in the studio.     Other than that, the best post-Beatles story is the recording session for \\"Band on the Run\\", which was plagued with a lot of problems, but one of McCartney's best selling albums if not the biggest one.
0689815816|2.0|As an Early Chilhood Educator for 27 years I was disapointed by the book.  It is not the storyline I have ever heard. The book is very small (6x6) and bulky for a child to hold.  The drawings are sweet but tiny on an already small book. I would never have purchased this book had I looked at it in the store.
B002708NAA|5.0|This album does a lot of things right.  As a long time PSB fan (I can't believe it's been more than 20 years), the album brings back a lot of the things that made me a big fan in the late 80s and early 90s.  Songs like \\"All over the world\\", \\"Did you see me coming?\\" and \\"Pandemonium\\" have that popish optimism that lifts you up and is a characteristic of many of their best songs.     The other good thing about the album is that there are songs that I may have not enjoyed as much when I was a teenager, but now I can appreciate.  \\"The way it used to be\\" is my favorite of the album and is one such song about a long-term love relationship.  The more I listen to it, the more I like it.  Another masterpiece is \\"Legacy\\".  This one takes a few more listens, but then you get it and it is brilliant. Just sit on a comfortable chair or lie in bed, close your eyes, and listen to it.    There are no duds in this album.  The other songs are also strong and the album feels very cohesive.  You'll also notice a lot more complexity in the songs than you would have found in their songs from the 80s.     Thank you Neil and Chris for another great album!  Please add US cities to your tour!
B001RQ0SJO|3.0|I first have to say that I loved Fur and Gold. I thought the music was refreshing and raw-something new. Natasha Khan has a great voice and loved her arrangements on this first album. Having said that, this second album seems like a bunch of money was thrown at her (a curse on a lot of second albums). It is too slick. Too many synths-where are the great eclectic acoustic instruments of the first album? Her voice now seems more of a wash than the focal point. I don't really understand the hype behind this album.  I think the magic is gone, but I have faith that she can get it back if she just listens to heart rather than her record company and management.
0446402397|4.0|This book starts off a little slow and the mystery doesn't present itself right away. However, once you get into it, it's very difficult to put down. And the slow start is more than adequately paid off by the end of the book, so all told a great read with many twists and turns along the way. The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating was that it wraps up just *a little too* neatly.
0316017922|5.0|The Outlier has some very good ideas. I enjoyed reading it even though I wouldn't have picked it out myself. Its an interesting mix of psychology, encouragement, facts and experiences. I definitely feel that I learned something from reading it.
B00007EDY5|4.0|I was so happy to find out that a product like this exists!  It's exactly what I needed to connect my old Sunpak flashes to my new Nikon D60, and it works like a charm!  It's a great price, too, even for the name brand, which, I've read, is worth the little extra.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Adorable movie not scary, just a few tense moments for the robots' safety.  I got this for my kids 12, 10, and 8.  We enjoyed watching it, and laughed at all the jokes, but I think they were a little bored.  If I had seen it before I bought it, I would not have paid full price. It is not a movie they will watch multiple times like others we have.
0517548232|4.0|This book is a fine introduction to how economic theory can dictate policies that promote the economic well being of society. The focus of the book is \\"The Law of Unintended Consequences\\", and the author brings in countless examples of how well meaning policies, such as price ceilings, rent control, etc have led to disastrous results.    In giving it 4 stars instead of 5, I'd like to point out some concerns.  1) The book, while a classic, is somewhat dated. The ideas are still pertinent, but many examples are not as relevant today.  2) I'm afraid that reading Naked Economics first spoiled me a bit. This book lacked the humor and pep that kept me engrossed in the former.     3) Most importantly, the book is strictly about economics, and is too simplistic in some ways. It fails to incorporate the complex real world political dynamics that determine policy. Today, most congressmen are sold on the benefits of free trade. But the barriers to economic growth are more nuanced in the real world.   Some will argue that this was not the focus of the book, and they are correct. Still, I fear that a reader will latch onto Hazlitt's ideas as a panacea, and fail to appreciate that in a world where \\"Keeping up with the Joneses\\" is as important, if not more important, than how much wealth one has, that policy decisions are more complex that the author would have us believe.
B001F7MSFM|3.0|I thought the first movie introduced some great characters, but I didn't care much for the story, which I barely remember now.  The sequel has more impressive visuals and action (particularly in the battle with the forest god), but again the story is pretty blah.  This is yet another movie that involves a legend, a magical object, and a magical army.  Once you learn that the villain and his twin sister are \\"linked,\\" it's not hard to predict how the film is going to end.    Bottom line: An enjoyable comic book flick, but it still feels like the Hellboy universe hasn't met its full potential.  This ill-tempered, wise-cracking, cat-loving, cigar-smoking, demonic crime fighter deserves better.    Richard Yee, author of [[ASIN:1441462163 Deliveries: A Collection]]
0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell is an out-of-the-box thinker who sees the world in a non-traditional way. He challenges your assumptions and gets you to think. I like that in a book. I end up penciling a lot of questions and comments in the book margins as I read Gladwell. We have been talking in our family about the ideas in this book for weeks. This book definitely sparks discussion.

Annika has done a fine job with this book, the proof in in how captivating it has been for my kids.   At first glance these examples look complex and near impossible to do, but the way the instructions are broken down and stepped through, what happens is a whole lot of fun.  What an excellent introduction to fine crafting - very well done!
B001B7CNXI|2.0|This disc is possibly not authentic BluRay original.  I have had audio problems, as well as noticed the image quality is not as sharp as BluRay should be.     This is possibly a burned copy.  The main menu and lack of previews in the intro to the DVD are clues.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|This complete series is not well organized.  The disks are packaged all together--ie. not by Season, and there is NOT a synopsis of each episode.  If you are looking for a particular episode, you will never find it the way this compilation is organized. Look for a Complete Series where the dvds are better organized physically, and have a summary of EACH episode.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|In Chains, Come Back, Miles Away/Truth is, Corrupt, Wrong - these are all GREAT tracks...And In Sympathy, Fragile Tension are also pretty good.    But in my opinion, 3 Awesome tracks that should have been on this release are \\"Light\\" (my favorite track on SOFTU), \\"Ghost\\" and \\"Oh Well\\"... but appear only on the expensive boxed set as Bonus Tracks.
B00006I53S|3.0|When I decided to upgrade, I chose this canon 28-135 mm os from the small letter below the original advertisement. The one that says \\"new:$319.95\\".   I thought that saving a hundred wouldn't be so bad. Well, first thing. This is a kit lens from a camera, taken and sent it in just a plain box, no warranty, no paper or any documentation whatsoever. After that, I realized that they advised about this in small print under the picture of the lens. The delivery was not definitely by UPS because UPS have you sign for any delivery and I found my box three steps from my door. I have a closed fence. Therefore, for my package to get there, it should be thrown over the fence. I have ordered other things from amazon and I've always been pleased with the service and the delivery. Next time, I'll buy strictly from them and not from any company that advertise through them.
B000BRNL12|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  So far it's one of my favorites.  The author does not expect the reader to believe all his theories, he just wants people to open their minds a little and question things more.  I don't really believe all his theories, but they are very fascinating. If you are a close-minded person then this book isn't for you.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|This 3 DVD set is great for young and old alike if you enjoy science fiction, especially the Star Wars series.  There is nothing like \\"The Force\\" to be reckoned with!  I would highly recommend these movies, although there is a high level of fighting and \\"droid killing\\" involved throughout each separate movie plot.
0525950079|5.0|The authors research on this time period is superb.  The way he weaves in a fast paced, gripping story makes it all the better.  You wish it would not end.
B00009NHC5|4.0|An excellent cast and plot makes this movie a compelling thriller. It's great to see Hepburn, Crenna, Zimbalist Jr. Weston and Arkin together weaving their magic. The cars in the scenes may show their age, but the movie does not. Good is good, and this film is definitely worth watching.

B001IBIQU6|1.0|Depeche Mode has just released their long-anticipated new album, \\"Sounds Of The Universe.\\"  Unfortunately, it does not live up to the hype AT ALL.  Now I was considering making a track-by-track review of this album, but I decided against it because I really don't want to waste any extra microglial cells thinking about it.  I realize that the following review of this album will garner some \\"not helpful review\\" tallies (particularly among those people who bow down to the \\"greatness\\" of Depeche Mode and will fanatically praise any material they put out), but to each his own.  My style of reviewing music has always encompassed a very holistic perspective, keeping in mind the group as a whole (their history, present, and future).  So with that said, here we go.    \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" is definitely like nothing Depeche Mode has ever done before.  They have completely broken from their past and embraced a new direction, which I congratulate them for being so bold and risk-taking.  However, that new direction is the wrong one, and that's CLEAR.  In the early 80s, Depeche Mode fully embraced the essence of synth-pop (catchy melodies as evidenced on \\"Speak and Spell\\" and \\"A Broken Frame\\").  Once \\"Construction Time Again\\" was released, they've certainly hit their stride, achieving a darker and more experimental tone while still maintaining their trademark melodious hook.     Depeche Mode's unique style exponentially re-invented itself and progressed to even greater heights as the years went on.  The \\"Violator\\" and \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" era was their highest level of achievement, and it's clear that Alan Wilder was VITAL to the band.  After he left DM, the band went through a slight mutation.  With the release of \\"Ultra,\\" we first start seeing the band evolve into a new direction.  And that album was GREAT.  It took on a more industrial tone, and DM pulled it off well.      After \\"Ultra,\\" we next have \\"Exciter.\\"  I really can't understand why Amazon reviewers gavethis 3 and 1/2 stars (see the review for yourself).  I really think that album was EXCELLENT.  It was the album that first got me into Depeche Mode, and I regret not seeing them on that tour.  Again, DM embraced an entirely new direction which worked:  songs with a slower tempo and great lyrics.  In fact, what made this album great was that it had a very \\"erotic\\" tone to it . . . very sultry and seductive.  Next time you listen to this album, see if you can pick that feel up.  The tone of \\"Exciter\\" really should be done again because the mellow feel to the album just works for this seminal band.    Next we move to \\"Playing The Angel\\".  At this point in Depeche Mode's history, they've adopted a new producer, Ben Hillier.  Ever since he came onto the scene, Depeche Mode has never been the same, and unless he's completely extricated from this band, DM will continue to falter.  Mr. Hillier is like an ever-mutating virus that will continue to evade any vaccine.  He has completely transformed the band into an experimental mess.  With \\"Playing The Angel,\\" we first started seeing (and hearing) the seeds of his metamorphosing destruction.  The first 5 songs of the album are TERRIFIC, harking back to the \\"Violator\\" days easily, and \\"Precious\\" was one of DM's best singles in years.  After \\"Precious\\" (with the exception of \\"I Want It All\\"), the album just goes way downhill.  Songs like \\"Damaged People\\", \\"Macro,\\" and \\"Nothing's Impossible\\" clearly show Ben Hillier's destructive damage, which is in full swing in Sounds Of The Universe.    With SOTU, the virus has completely taken hold and infiltrated the band.  The melodious hooks that Depeche Mode was so well-known for are COMPLETELY GONE.  The choice of \\"Wrong\\" as the first single definitely raised a few warning flags that this album would signal the end of Depeche Mode.  The songs on this album are full of experimental bleeps and space-like music.  I really can't understand why people would praise this album so heavily.  It'svery drony, and Martin Gore does use some of the old analog instruments from the 80s, but the WAY and MANNER they are being used is AWFUL.  And I have no doubt in my mind that Ben Hillier had a lot to do with this.    As far as I'm concerned, Ben Hillier will go down in history as the man who ruined Depeche Mode.  If \\"Exciter\\" got 3 and 1/2 stars on Amazon, and it's a clearly better album than this one, I can't wait to see what SOTU will receive as time goes on.  I guarantee you that it will also get 3 1/2 stars, and if not, less than that.  Everyone is giving this album rave reviews as soon as it's released, which is understandable because they're all so hyped up about the new Depeche Mode album.  They don't seem to have any foresight, which is what's needed here to review this album in a holistic light.      So in summary, I'm ready for those \\"thumbs down\\" feedback tallies, but I hope you all appreciate my viewpoint and see the truth of what's going on within Depeche Mode.  If you can sympathize with my views, great.  If not, to each his own.  There are two things Depeche Mode must do:  1) Get rid of the virus Ben Hillier and 2) Make their next album truly a \\"comeback album\\" (IF there will be a next album).   If those aren't fulfilled, then I really fear for the future of this seminal band.
B001SAHOBO|5.0|If you're looking for some excellent fighting sequences, this is the movie for you! I know others have said that the subtitles are of poor quality, and they are. I don't know any Chinese so the syncing/dubbing over was not a problem for me...I guess sometimes ignorance is bliss.     Donnie Yen (Ip Man) is amazing. I will definitely be purchasing more of his movies. My only problem with the movie is that it propogates the incorrect theory that Wing Chun was created by a woman. Being a woman myself, I wish that were true!! If you're curious or angry about that statement check out the Ving Tsun Museum in Huber Heights, [...]    Overall, if you love Wing Chun (gung fu in general), this is a terrific movie to add to your collection.
0307269752|5.0|Refer to an European Atlas for Maps of Sweden to follow this well written story a little better. The characters are fully and clearly developed so well that I felt I knew them by story end. I am a fan of crime novels, historical as well as modern-day, and this is well worth the time.

We also recommend Secret Birthday Message, Hungry Caterpillar, Head to Toe, all Eric Carle
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Picking up shortly after Elizabeth I left off the movie portrays the complicated life of one of England's greatest Monarchs. Elizabeth The Golden Age, shows us the balance which was required of Elizabeth, balancing the incredible tenacity and guts it took to rule England and her fears and longings for real love and security.<br /><br />  Elizabeth's life is a story of overcoming the odds. Born second child of Henry VIII and his second wife Anne Boleyn, she was supposed the be the long awaited and promised son of the King, yet Henry's wishes for a son were dashed upon her birth. In the first movie we see the growth of her strength which Elizabeth must muster to survive, and in The Golden Age we see the strength come into full bloom, the strength she will need to overcome the looming Spanish evasion and the always present question of marriage and producing a male heir.<br /><br />  Europe has become divided by Protestant and Catholic, and Elizabeth's own country and family has fallen along divided lines as well. Queen Mary of Scotland sits to the north imprisoned by Elizabeth, but Mary possesses something that Elizabeth does not have, the backing of Catholic Spain and France. For Elizabeth it is only a matter of time until she will be called upon to do something about the looming threat of Mary. When that time comes we find Elizabeth torn between what must be done to a trader and the rights of a sovereign Queen like herself.<br /><br />  It is this decision which leads to the climax of the movie. Mary is favored by Spain and with the outcome of Mary's fate, Spain steps into action to crush the Protestant [...] Elizabeth. Elizabeth faced with an impeding invasion of the Spanish steps forward to encourage her  countrymen in the battle and protect her beloved England.<br /><br />  However The Golden Age is not solely about the battles between countries but the battles of the heart. Elizabeth although known as the Virgin Queen is not without the need of love and passion. Yet Elizabeth knows that this could pose as big a threat to her and her country as the Spanish and French.<br /><br />This film is truly a feast for the eyes - incredible costumes and sets are only the beginning. I would recommend that one watch The Golden Age after first viewing Elizabeth I. It will assist in knowing where Elizabeth has been and the amount of growth in Elizabeth is amazing to watch.nows that this could pose as big a threat to her and her country as the Spanish and French.

B0000AYL17|5.0|I don't think so! At least not until the SACD gods release \\" Aja \\". The first song easily has the best dynamic range of any rock recording I've ever heard. Panoramic sound-staging and depth. Donald Fagan and friends spent, reportedly one million dollars, producing this album and it sounds it! After hearing great reproductions of lousy recordings (Dylan, Kinks, Creedence, ad nauseum), why doesn't someone release the entire Steely Dan catalogue?...and Donald Fagen's \\"Nightfly\\" as long as they're at it?
0064430227|5.0|Ok, the title of my review says it all. I'm biased yes, because this book won us over me and my 5yr old daughter both. We are pretty picky bedtime story readers. We favor the Jillian Jigs types of books and this hit the mark. Harold is so endearing, creative and simple that he is just impossible not to like. What a fantastic twist on words this book offers. We love it!

B001RTP48G|5.0|It has been over 20 years since the Pet Shop Boys have made there debut and Yes shows they are still going strong.  If I were to just play a friend the new songs I am pretty sure he would say that they were done in the early 90's as they have a very timeless feel to them.<br />Not sure how the songs of Yes will do in the clubs, but Love Etc sounds pretty catchy and could easily be turned into a hit.  The rest of the album is solid and in my opinion this is the best album out of the last 4.
B001DJ7PR8|2.0|We usually like Woody Allen.  But this movie lacked a point.  I would say it was a waste of talent but it was the type of movie that made me wonder if the actors WERE talented.  Scarlett Johansson always plays a cool, detached character and she was no different here. She is good to look at but there was no passion.  Javier Bardem is an attractive actor but his characters are easy to dislike. And there was no chemistry between most of them.  The Americans in this film are all archetypal.  Penelope Cruz deserved her award; she added a much-needed spark.  But this film went nowhere.  And to think I used to be annoyed when English teachers would say, \\"What is the purpose of this story?\\"      If one cannot really like ANY of the characters, it is very hard to like a film.  I don't like to accuse the truly great Woody Allen of self-indulgence but I think here he needs focus. The photography aspect (Cristina's) could have and should have gone somewhere.  I got the feeling that this was an old script, resurrected.  It was not, unless it came from the bottom of the writer's trunk, but it was anachronistic.       The scenery was delightful.  Wish there had been even more Gaudi.    So I'll give it two stars.
031606792X|1.0|I was really expecting so much more. She builds up the the fight scene, but nothing happens! I really expected to find love and romance, but all i found was out of character Characters. Edward was always love driven yet level headed. But in this, he goes to the extent of wanting to get rid of the crazy love child. I feel that he would have stood up for Renesmee instead of killing her and pay off Jacob to be a father to a child for bella so bella doesn't have to go through the pain. I find it extremely ridiculous. I hated this book....    I'm going to repress the memories of breaking dawn. The Twilight series ended after Eclipse.
B001C3KCSY|1.0|My first experience with Kings of Leon was with their very first CD. I heard that they had a \\"Southern Rock\\" sound (so, why were they played on my local Alternative Rock station?) and that they were an up and coming band. I bought their first CD and played it once...never to listen again. BORING!<br /><br />Several years later, I hear that KOL wins a Grammy Award for their latest offering. This time I sneak a listen at a local FYE and this one is even worse. SUPER BORING!<br /><br />It's not really fair, I tend to like music with a bit more energy than most alternative/college rock. I'm just always looking for something new that will get my blood pumping... KOL just give me the old flatline.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I read this book in a matter of days.  It was extremely entertaining, depressing, touching, and funny all at the same time.  Imagine what it would be like if Studs Terkel wrote a book about zombies.  This is it.  :)
B001R10BM8|4.0|Although this was not my favorite James Bond movie, and is basically a rehash of Thunderball, it did bring back Sean Connery. It also managed to outperform MGM's simultaneous release of Octopussy which starred a rather geriatric looking Roger Moore. (I think Connery looked more the part then Moore did at this point). It also had a better cast in my opinion. The blu-ray release looks and sounds stunning. I believe it is a must buy for any Bond fan

B001KPYNR0|5.0|I am more of a tradionalist when it comes to Christmas albums.  I prefer the sounds of Bing, Andy Williams, Brenda Lee, etc...    However, lately I have been wanting to find Christmas albums with a different sound rather then the same old same old that I am used to listening too.    Enya most certainly fit the bill.  Having been an Enya fan for a long time now, I was so excited when I saw that she was releasing a Christmas/winter album.  I was just hoping that it wasn't the \\"traditional\\" Christmas sounding music, and more along Enya's own personal style.  To my delight, her newest album is ALL Enya.  I love it, and I give it an enthusiastic thumbs up!

Ever since lateralus they began sucking and now this ? Rock is dead so il stick to my old records. laters, do skip this junk
B001RTP48G|5.0|I've seen a number of magazine reviews of Pet Shop Boy's new CD, \\"Yes,\\" claiming that it's their best since \\"Nightlife\\" (1999) or even \\"Very\\" (1993). I was skeptical at first; however, after repeated listens, I have to agree. Now, I love pretty much everything PSB do, but \\"Yes\\" is pretty spectacular, with a heavy emphasis on lush vocals and strings layered over dance beats, which is the sound that made me such a fan of PSBs back in the 1980s.<br /><br />The first single is the upbeat \\"Love Etc.\\" The song is about the hollowness of living the material life without love; certainly a well-worn topic, but the boys manage to craft a solid single. The song has a catchy if repetitive chorus - You need more/ you need more/ you need more/ you need loooooove. I prefer the verses, with background singers chanting phrases like \\"don't have to have\\" leading into Neil enumerating various trappings of money, such as \\"a house in Beverly Hills.\\" I have to admit that I don't find \\"Love Etc.\\" to be the most original PSB single, but I do like it. In the U.K., the boys continue to have solid success. \\"Love Etc.\\" debuted at #14 on the singles charts, continuing their trend of top 20 hits (only two of their singles have ever peaked lower - \\"Was It Worth It\\" in 1991 and \\"Numb\\" in 2006).<br /><br />My favorite song on \\"Yes\\" is the lush, mid-tempo \\"King of Rome,\\" which reminds me of some of their slower moments from the \\"Behaviour\\" era, such as \\"Only the Wind\\" or \\"To Face the Truth.\\" The melody is beautiful and Neil's vocals positively throb with melancholia. I also love the danceable \\"All Over the World,\\" which is probably the most stereotypically PSB song on the CD. Sampling Tchaikovsky's \\"Nutcracker,\\" the song is upbeat, joyous, and a bit over the top in the tradition of other great PSB anthems. It's another one of their (very successful) attempts to put \\"Debussy to a disco beat\\" - well in this case it's Tchaikovsky. The third song I'd like to highlight is \\"Beautiful People.\\" Not many fans seem to be talking about this song, but I think it's an amazing track.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|The word aristocracy comes from ancient greek \\"ariston\\", meaning \\"the best\\". It contains the Indo-European root \\"ar\\". The same root appears in the latin (and Lithuanian) words \\"ara\\" - altar - and \\"aratrum\\" - plow. Hence, civilization (that is the offspring of agriculture), spirit, and aristocracy. \\"Ar\\" also appears in sanscrit \\"Arya\\", \\"the nobles\\", who spread in the gangetic plane and documented their religion in the Vedic texts. Precisely their Vedas teach the meaning of action separated by its consequences. They teach to act not because of the outcome of action, but because of its significance. Because the action itself calls the noble into acting.<br /><br />Strange, isn't it?  This simple philological analysis, as well as a distracted look at any european mythology or at the life of illustrious romans, seems to suggest that civilization (\\"aratrum\\") did not come  from utilitarianism, from the carefully planned, greedy action, sharpened to optimize its consequences. Paradoxically, the founders of our civilization unconsciously believed it came from the generous action that had a value in itself, whatever the consequences: noble, great gestures. As if only that action could renovate the spirit and the universe. Action as a sacrifice to the gods, in the Bhagavad Gita. Action as the altar (\\"ara\\") on which the best ones (\\"aristoi\\", \\"arya\\") could sacrifice.<br /><br />I felt this sentiment reverberating over and over in this magnificent documentary, a true hymn to the meaning of nobility. I found it a powerful antidote to the lack of meaning, the greediness, the smallness of our world. Everybody witnessing the event or participating in it was deeply touched. While remembering it, many cried.<br /><br />In the action without apparent meaning, true meaning is found. In the calculating, greedy pettiness, meaning is lost. This is where we came from. From this we have fallen. One of Petit's quotes should be carved in stone \\"I had just done this incredible, impossible, magnificent gesture, and the only thing they could give me was this very american, very utilitarian *why, why, why?*. But there was  no why.\\"only thing they could give me was this very american, very utilitarian *why, why, why?*. But there was  no why.\\"
B001IBIQU6|1.0|Depeche Mode finally created their worst album ever.     David Gahan is finding himself into the disaster of metalic senseles flat sounds. The arregements in no way creates the atmosphere required to impulse the songs.     Probably the album should be called \\"Wrong\\" and I believe is the only theme that has some sort of efford but still far away from any other experimental Depeche Mode previous theme.     In other times or without the brand name that Alan Wilder and Vince Clarke created for the band this album wouldn't be aceptep by any record lable. It does not have nothing to give.     The only song I would consider good would be Come Back but not the album version, but the studio version you can watch on Youtube.

031606792X|3.0|Breaking Dawn is not a bad book, but really, does it need to be 753 pages? So much fluff could have been left out. For example. the part with the conflict with the wolves splitting into two packs. It got to the point where I was reading it to be done with it, just to see how it all ends, not so much because I was enjoying it. I did enjoy Bella's section more than Jacob's. The pages dedicated to her pregnancy and birth and subsequent turning immortal were exciting. However, I really wanted the ending to be more dramatic than it was. It wouldn't have been so bad to have Bella and Edward die in a battle to save their daughter.     So, would I recommend this book? Yes, if you've invested time in reading (and enjoyed) the previous books. But since Ms. Meyer has a problem with editing, don't be afraid to skim through the more boring parts of this book. Chances are you won't be missing much.
B000002UAF|5.0|After the group's appearance on the Ed Sullivan show on February 9, 1964, Beatlemania hit it's full stride.<br /><br />United Artists chose to make a musical comedy featuring the band in a pseudo-documentary style, showcasing a typical day in the Beatles lives, as they sang and played their newest songs.<br /><br />Considering the songs were written by John & Paul between shows and tv appearances, the quality is astounding, and produced the best album of \\"the early years\\".<br /><br />The Tracks:<br /><br />In typical Beatles fashion, the title cut, \\" A Hard Day's Night\\" was the last song written for the project, following Ringo's famous remark that became the film's title.<br />The song itself is one of the Beatles' all-time best, opening with an amazing chord (Dm 7 w/ G&C bass) played by George on his new Rickenbacker electric 12-string. That guitar would become the trademark sound of the entire album.<br />John's double-tracked lead vocal over the high energy rhythm section is joyous, and Paul's bridge vocals take it to another level.<br />George Harrison's 12-string and producer George Martin's piano double up for a thick kick-a** solo section.<br />After another middle 8 and another verse, George's Bach-inspired picking ends the song.<br /><br />\\"I Should Have Known Better\\" is another happy slice of pop fun, featuring John on vocal and harmonica, with almost a Bob Dylan feel to it.<br />George's 12-string solo is bright and chime-y. Could this have arguably been the first \\"folk-rock\\" song ?<br /><br />\\"If I Fell\\" is a classic two-part harmony ballad featuring John & Paul both singing on the same mike,to get an Everly Brothers type of sound.<br />Very sweet, with touches of 12-string here and there.<br /><br />\\"I'm Happy Just to Dance with You\\" was written for George to be his contribution to the film.<br />The hard driving punctuated rhythm has a lot of action for a song less than 2 minutes in length.<br /><br />\\"And I Love Her\\" is Paul the balladeer.<br />Originally conceived as an electric rock song (check out Anthology 1), they switched to acoustics and latin percussion for a softer sound.<br />George's nylon string solo is haunting and romantic.<br /><br />\\"Tell Me Why\\" is a very danceable number,with classic 3-part harmony by John, Paul & George.<br /><br />\\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" is the last of the film songs, and was actually recorded as a single that was at the top of the charts while filming was going on.<br />Essentially, it's an up tempo 12-bar blues belted out by Paul,and featuring a \\"superbly sloppy\\" guitar solo courtesy of George's Gretsch Country Gentleman.<br /><br />The 2nd half of the album consists of non-soundtrack album cuts.<br /><br />\\"Any Time At All\\" is one of the great underrated Beatles' classics.<br />Excellent lead vocal from John, nice chords and melody, and again, the 2 Georges combine their instruments to construct a distinctive instrumental section. A real rockin' tune.<br />\\"Things We Said Today\\" is another Paul number written around a major/minor sequence, with tempo changes in the middle to make it interesting.The aoustic guitar/piano combo on the A minor chord makes for a striking musical hook.<br /><br />\\"I'll Cry Instead\\" is the first of what would be later called John's message songs.<br />It's a country-rock feel backing John as he sings about \\"locking himself up today\\".<br />\\"When I Get Home\\", however, is a little rocker simply about getting home to the one you love to \\"get lots of lovin'\\". Simple message simply performed.<br /><br />\\"You Can't Do That\\" was actually recorded and had a sequence shot for the film, but didn't make the cut.<br />The actual first song recorded for this album, and the first song to feature George's Rick 12-string , it's John's tribute to Wilson Pickett, and actually features John on the strange middle guitar break.<br />Recorded on George's 21st birthday (2/25/1964), this song set the tone for the whole album.<br />\\"I'll Be Back\\" was conceived as a waltz, then moved to 4/4 time, is a fitting closer to the album,for the Beatles would most assuredly \\"be back\\"<br />The album and film were both very successful in chronicling the most happy period in the band's life.<br />Great film, great album. 5 Stars.period in the band's life.  Great film, great album. 5 Stars.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|I was a pretty good fan of Muse before hearing this album.  I had first encountered the band when I played Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, on when I got to \\"play\\" their track, \\"Knights of Cydonia.\\"  Instantly, I fell in love with the sound of the band, and was impressed by the difficulty by which they play.<br /><br />I first learned of this album when I was playing with my iPhone one day during a quick morning break.  I was looking through the YouTube App, and was checking out the \\"Featured\\" tab, of which was a video from the H.A.A.R.P. DVD - the video to \\"Knights of Cydonia.\\"  It was the first time I saw the band perform live, even though I was in my apartment here in the USA.  I was amazed at the quality of the recording.  I thought it was going to be a user-created video of the concert, complete with barely-audible music due to the screaming crowds, but boy, was I wrong.  The very stylish video opened with Matthew Bellamy coming out on stage in black and white, with his red jacket and pants colorized vividly.  He then played those three distorted notes and that chord, repeated, and broke down into the \\"surfer intro\\" to Knights of Cydonia.  I was sucked-in.  The whole stadium got colorized, and the song kicked -so- hard!<br /><br />I learned that the H.A.A.R.P. CD came with the DVD with footage of the concert.  I bought it.  I spent a whole weekend watching the concert and listening to the album.  I loved it.  I looked into their other albums and realized that because of H.A.A.R.P., I became a bonified fan of MUSE.<br /><br />If you like Muse, or alternative rock splashed with a little bit of techno, grunge, and classical influences, then you will _LOVE_ Muse's H.A.A.R.P. album.  If you want to know what Muse is like - look up one of their videos on Google Video or YouTube.  They can be best described as a mix somewhere between Radiohead meets Rage Against the Machine meets Gershwin.  I wish I would've been a fan sooner, and could've gone to this concert.  Hopefully I'll get to see them live one day!<br /><br />The album is great.  There are a few songs that aren't on the album that are on the DVD, and vice-versa, since concert took place over two days, and footage/audio is used from both concerts.<br /><br />I hope and pray that this album will get released on Blu-Ray, because it is truly worthy of it!  And if it does, I hope it includes complete footage and/or audio from both days of both concerts!  We should get the whole picture!  If anyone reads this who has influence in getting things moved to Blu-Ray - this is a -must-do!em live one day!    The album is great.

B001D2AYCI|4.0|Don`t get me wrong, I thought the remaster sounds great. Haven`t got to hear the bonus disc yet. My problem is with the Quad transfer. As well I thought I was having problems with my surround system. Not sure if this from the quad master itself and they just released it as is with no frills or a poor transfer from an old home retail tape that was laying around in somebody`s garage. Maybe the book will say what. All I know is you can barely hear Ozzy`s Vocals on \\"War Pigs\\". Had my surround speakers all the way up. And sounds muddy as can be.      The images for the dvd is a pretty nice change from just 1 picture but in my opinion got a little monotonous after awhile (Repeating pictures-but that`s not really an issue. This is DVD Audio).   I could rant on but I won`t. I`m stil giving 4 stars though.     UPDATE: After really listening to this mess a second time(the dvd that is) and finding out it was sourced from vinyl,My question now is \\"Why even Bother?!\\"  Why bother to even pull such a stunt if the quad masters don`t exist? I`m no professional but come on! Lets get real here!  I feel like I`ve been ripped off now. It would have been just fine if it was just released with the 2 cd`s by themselves and leave the dvd out.  Too bad I can`t get a refund otherwise this would be shipped back. What a way to treat a classic album and screw the Fans over! I Wonder if the record company reads these reviews. Maybe they would get the hint.
B001ECQ75A|1.0|I have been charged for this item and still not received it.  I have sent email after email to the shipper to no avail.  They have not even had the courtesy to respond or let me know if my money will be refunded or if I will receive the movie I ordered.  Any help Amazon can offer would be greatly appreciated.
1416550542|5.0|This is a big novel and will be added to my list of favorite books! There is so much to think about in THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN that it's difficult to write a short review, but I think, it's important not to reveal too much.    This is a story with many layers and it begins with a four year old girl who is on a ship that leaves England and lands in Australia in the year 1913.  The child is alone and waiting. She had been told by someone called the authoress to stay hidden until she returns to get her! The authoress never returned!  Upon arriving in Australia, the dock master takes her home until someone comes forth to identify the child. She has brought a small case with her which contains her clothes and a wonderful book of fairy tales. Since she's never identified, the dock master and his wife call her Nell and she's raised in a very loving family. When she becomes older, she's told of how she was found and that shocking information changes her complete outlook on life.    Over the years, Nell hires private detectives and begins to learn a little bit of information about her birth family. The book covers the years from the early 1900's  to the year 2005. The story is told in bits and pieces and not in calendar sequence. It covers Nell's search on the Cornish coast of England and her visit there brings back memories when she discovers a cottage that's almost a magical place! It contains a  secret garden that brings back memories to Nell that are deeply buried in her mind. The story is also revealed by members of her birth family. Finally, Nell's granddaughter, Cassandra, continues on with the search for the truth about what happened to Nell!    This book is rich with beautiful imagery and some characters that do seem to be from fairy tales!
B000002HGD|2.0|Being a big sopranos fan and having watched episode \\"join the club\\" where Tony is having his dreams while his on the e.r. from a gun wound from his crazed uncle. I heard the brilliant track titled \\" when its cold i like to die\\" by moby sang by Mimi Goese, who also sang into the blue. Both tracks are wonderfull but i realy hate  Mobys techno songs but his slow songs are realy great. Almost the whole album sounds pretty annoying, except for the two slow tunes. Moby stick to your slow songs : )
B001XJEKGC|1.0|I went to this show at MSG expecting an unbelievable show and all I got was 2 hours of the same annoying guitar solos. Thats all this is...guitar solos. No real music, no real talent. Worst show ive ever seen in my life, and a huge waste of $1000 on tickets for my family. I dont receommend this at all.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I really enjoyed this workout, I workout about six times a week for an hour and thought I would find this workout super easy (especially the level 1) I was pleasantly surprised that it is difficult and incorporates activities I have been neglecting in my workouts (like push ups). My only qualm is that it is only 20 minutes (at least there are three 20 minute workouts so you can theoretically do more)but I would prefer a 45 minute workout. All in all though I think this workout is really good, though I will do it in conjunction with about 45 mins on the elliptical just to get the calorie burn up. I would say that the difficulty is on par (if not slightly more difficult) with most of the turbojam workouts. I would definitely recommend this DVD!
B0007CNXUK|3.0|But Winslet and Christie are definitely in roles that could have been better written.  Winslet exists just to chase kids and get sick, and there must have been more to the relationship between her character and Depp's than that.  But it's a nice family film, even if a bit slow for the younger kids.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|Not much to say or review, this album is so different and creative !! ... is such a great album !!! ..... for those how rate this with one or two stars, get Britney Spears, Beyonce, U2 or something very very commercial.... cheers !!!!
B001N18HOQ|5.0|Pearl Jam's Ten was arguably one of the best rock albums ever.  When I heard that they were reissuing a remastered version, I was a little skeptical.  After listening to it, I can see why they went through the effort.  They were able to build on the legacy by adding in a few unreleased tracks and an awesome version of \\"State of Love and Trust\\".  Whether you are a hardcore fan, or just a fan of music, this is an awesome production, and a must have for any collection.
B00005S6K6|4.0|It is true, as one reviewer cites, that this movie glorifies infidelity; however, I'm reviewing this film from an acting stand point. It is, in a word, flawless. The portrayals given by DeNiro and Streep are so natural, without a hint of Actor' Studio tainting, that one is drawn into the lives of these two uncomplicated, yet driven, individuals. I'm sure many of us have been confronted with similar temptations but have resisted due to upbringing and cultural mores that condemn such behavior. This is at the heart of this film vignette. The struggle to do the right thing, so as not to hurt others, and the impulse to engage in that which is contrary to our marital values and ideals.    This film should, at the very least, be evaluated on the terrific nuance performances of two of the greatest actors in American film history. If for nothing else, it should be viewed and studied on that bases.
B001TOD92C|5.0|I can't think of Mickey Rourke and not remember his work two decades ago in films like 9 1/2 weeks and Angel Heart and The Pope of Greenwich Village.  He was a handsome \\"Bad Boy\\" and seemed to be on a career arc similar to Johnny Depp and Robert Downey, Jr.  The story goes that he was quite difficult to work with, and he lost acting opportunities.  He became a professional boxer and went undefeated in eight international bouts, but took enough of a beating that his handsome face is substantially different.<br />Darren Aronofsky (of the brilliant \\"Pi\\" and \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" and the not universally embraced \\"The Fountain\\") directs Rourke in a documentary-style film that positions Mickey Rourke perfectly in the role of Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, a professional wrestler who is way over the hill.<br /><br />The Ram was big - headline wrestler at Madison Square Garden big - but 20 years after his famous bout with \\"The Ayatollah\\", Randy wrestles small-time matches in little gyms and community centers surrounded by a crowd of a few hundred.  He lives alone in a small trailer park, and finds himself locked out early in the film, presumably because he's behind on his rent.  After he gets a few dollars into his hands from a wrestling match, he heads to bars and his favorite strip club.  Not long after he's locked out of his apartment he spends 60 dollars on a lap dance.<br /><br />Randy is over the hill in just about every way that a person can be.  He has a daughter who hates him for all the fathering he didn't do, and his heart, punished by his lifestyle and the pharmacy he pumps in so that he can wrestle, doesn't have that many ticks left.  After a heart attack his kindly Doctor advises him that he just simply can NOT wrestle any more.<br /><br />Randy is initially compliant and takes a more permanent job from a snippety little man who has been giving him part-time work.  The Ram pushes his flowing rock `n' roll mane up under a hair net and works at the deli counter, slicing cheese and ham and doling out pasta salad into little plastic containers.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei, another performer with a reputation for being \\"difficult\\", does amazing work here as the stripper with a heart.  She plays Pam, who has the stage name \\"Cassidy\\", and she has a soft place in her heart for Randy, even if he is beat up, ten years older, and tosses out young roughnecks when they're disrespectful to Cassidy, even if they were going to be paying customers.  But Pam also keeps Randy at arm's length, and for much of the film you don't know if it is because she was only pretending to like him or because she believes in the stripper's rule of not dating customers.<br /><br />Wrestling, we learn at an age slightly older than the age where we find out about Santa and the Easter Bunny, is fake - and some of the most interesting scenes in the film are seeing the buddy-buddy behemoth wrestlers backstage discussing the fake carnage they're going to enact in the ring.  Like much of the entertainment biz, \\"making it\\" in wrestling is not so much dependent on talent as coming up with a gimmick to hook the audience.  Randy has his famous \\"Ram Jam\\", diving off of the top ropes in the corner of the ring onto a prone opponent.  Before one match Randy's opponent asks him if he's \\"okay with the staples\\".  \\"Staples?\\" Randy asks.  \\"Staple gun.  Doesn't hurt that much going in, except a little scary, you know.  Gonna leave marks - a little blood loss.\\"  So, although we're reminded that the outcomes of the wrestling matches are fake - decided beforehand, usually in favor of \\"The Face\\" and against \\"The Heel\\", but the little details like staples and blood aren't faked.<br /><br />The best scenes in the film are when Randy is out in the real world, trying to find a foothold in the parts of his life he knows should be important.  But the choices he made that allowed him to become \\"Randy the Ram\\" have left gaping holes he is unable to repair, and Rourke's acting job makes this pathetic man a completely sympathetic character.  I found myself hoping that Randy's fragile heart would keep ticking long enough for him to reconcile with his daughter and break through Pam's façade.und myself hoping that Randy's fragile heart would keep ticking long enough for him to reconcile with his daughter and break through Pam's façade.
0307277453|5.0|i love this book. there are a few things which are new to me on genetics. the part about how gene turns on and turn off development of things and you can swap genes from different animals is just facinating. it inspires to feel my connections to all being and this planet.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Cool and hot all wrapped up in one! Diana's smooth, cool style with a sultry Latin flair, might be my new favorite album of hers!
B000Q6GX5Y|2.0|How can anyone like a movie with black computer-generated blood splatter ? This is one of those films where it seems the director can't decide if it should be in black and white or in color. This story was better done on the history channel with total animation. I did like the through-and-through spearings and the quick-slice decapitations in the battle scenes. Cool. A little creativity there. I didn't care about any grainy scenes on this blu-ray disc since I didn't like the movie anyway. Save your money. Rent or borrow it.
B000002KMV|5.0|One of the best concept albums that Prince has ever created is the truly amazing funk-fest that is Controversy. From the opening track which is, coincidentally, \\"Controversy\\", to the last track \\"Jack U Off\\", every song hooks you in to it's incredible funk groove and extremely emotional lyrics. Prince does EVERYTHING on this album. He writes the songs; he plays all the instruments; he sings all the lyrics; and it's even produced by him! Do yourself a favour, and listen to this rare work of original art, this brilliant piece of raw sexual energy, before you're engulfed by all the imitators doing the rounds.
1592289444|5.0|I'm not sure that every guy at McClintock Jr. High School read \\"The Long Walk\\" in 1958, but Slavomir Rawicz's 1956 book definitely enjoyed a cult following there. After all, almost every kid's old man had played some part in the War, South Pacific or Europe; and there was a ton of wartime pulp to be read, and I believe we must have read the better part of it. We read books like: \\"God is my Co-Pilot,\\" \\"Thirty Seconds over Tokyo,\\" \\"The Longest Day,\\" \\"Guadalcanal Diary,\\" \\"The Naked and the Dead.\\" The list could go on. There were the books with a slightly forbidden flavor by our former enemies: \\"Zero,\\" \\"Commando Extraordinary,\\" \\"The Road to Stalingrad.\\" But \\"The Long Walk,\\" stood in its own special category. I found it hard to put down at age fourteen, and, rereading it fifty jaded years later, I still couldn't put this one down.   Only now I'm wondering if perhaps I've just read a great novel by a certain Ronald Downing.  Back in '58 we didn't have the 1997 afterword in which Slav Rawicz uses the term: \\"read between the lines.\\" We didn't have the 1993 introduction to the Polish edition in which Slav writes, \\"If this little book has served in a small way as propaganda to understand the past years of our history under the Soviets, then my words will have achieved their purpose.\\" The structure of the book does make for the perfect road story, a framework upon which to hang a string of episodes: capture, imprisonment, torture, deportation, the camp, the escape, the journey. The assemblage of seven compatriots is reminiscent of the \\"Seven Samurai,\\" or \\"The Magnificent Seven.\\" Consider the character types of the escapees: the gentle giant, the little jokester, the American--and the girl Kristina. Add the superbly generous character of the Tibetans--by then weren't the Chinese kicking them around? In short: read this book and you will not like communists, but then, you didn't in the first place, did you?  Having said all that, what a pleasure it is to learn that Slav lived toa ripe old age, raising five children with a devoted wife, living to see Poland independent again, living to see the USSR dissolve. And if Slav and Ronald Downing chose to insert a few whoppers along the way, I say: who are we to let facts stand in the way of a good story?  Slav wrote in his 1997 afterword that he had received many letters over the years, and that he enjoyed answering them. I wish I'd been a little sooner rediscovering \\"The Long Walk.\\" I might have written Mr. Rawicz myself, and here's what I would have said:  Dear Mr. Rawicz, I know you have received many letters over the years and mine will probably eco much of what those others have said. However, if I might add anything, it is that since reading your book fifty years ago at age fourteen I have never to my memory left a plate of food un-cleaned; countless times I have been disgusted by the sight of unfinished plates being scraped into the garbage by others. Many times I have thought of you and your companions as I passed trash left by the roadside, trash that you could have used. (A few plastic soda bottles might have made all the difference on the Gobi.) I like to wear a thing out before discarding it. I do hate to be cold, but I try to refrain from complaining about it. So thank you, Mr. Rawicz, for inspiring the boy I was fifty years ago to take up frugal ways. I'm sure my bankroll is thicker for it. I would observe that, while you may have aimed a blow at communism, you also made a good hit at consumer capitalism!
B001CWOCV8|5.0|After reading the previous reviews, it was with trepidation that I ordered this anyway.  I am very glad I did.  I was ready to be disappointed when I popped it in, anticipating the disc would not play back per the other reviews.  I am using a PS3 with the latest firmware, and it plays back with no problem.  Plays the promotional trailer, brings up the menu, lets you select your options, etc.  BTW, I ordered through a reseller on Amazon, so not sure if that makes a difference which inventory you get the disc from.<br /><br />The disc itself displays in 1080i format, and I thought the picture looked pretty good.  It wasn't awe inspiring, as some 1080p discs I've seen, but pretty good picture quality nonetheless.  It was not grainy or anything like that.  As for audio, it does have a lossless audio option - DTS-HD MA.  All speaker channels worked fine with this option.  The concert itself features some great songs, including Commodores hits, I believe 22 songs in all.  Also has a behind the scenes special, as well as 2 music videos.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, give the BluRay a try.  If you get a working copy, it's a very nice piece to add to your music collection.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|I've always wanted to see Chris use his talents to explore many avenues of music, and he did it again. The unprecedented combination of Timbaland and Cornell make this album an innovative musical collaboration. Each song has the strong lyrical and vocal astonishment brought by Chris Cornell combined with the funky (if a tad overdone at times) beats and mixes that Timbaland is famous for. I love that Chris was willing to break yet another musical stereotype and explore new and innovative musical styles. Don't judge on the first listen (when you pick out your favorites), each listen through of the album gives me more appreciation of each song. Excellent album!

B000XYNFD2|5.0|This is an excellent watch for the money.    I thought I had it all when I first bought my 8926.  This watch has a Swiss 26 jewel movement which runs very smooth as compared to the 21 jewel Miyota movement.    Sapphire crystal is a huge bonus also, it will resist most scratches opposed to the Mineral crystal on the 8926 which got some really deep scratches for moderate use.    The bracelet on the 9937C is entirely different. It is much thicker and it actually has solid end links, a major bonus for me. The clasp is improved as well. I had  my middle links \\"brushed\\" to have it look more like a rolex. The polished middle links scratched too easily.    I prefer the coin edge (Rolex Style)  bezel, it has a far better grip compared to the scalloped bezel (Omega Style)...Although I own an Omega (\\"Bond\\" Seamaster 300M, Quartz) and love it.    Overall, This is a solid and elegant watch that is well worth the money spent. I would buy another one should something happen to mine.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a fantastic series that aired just recently.  Very informative with magnificent photography and seldomed seen events captured.  Narrative is slightly overridden by the 'background' music but a terrific documentary on our Earth.
B000WTLDPU|4.0|First, before seeing this movie please read the book (Stardust by Neil Gaiman).  This movie is a faithful adaption of the book.  It is a great fantasy and love story, with a twist of Adventure.  I really enjoyed this movie.  It has excellent special effects, and is fun to watch.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|What a nice DVD set! In my view this is Disney's best animated movie, at least until WALL-E. It's scary, and has some adult themes, but those elements give it great replay value. The extra features are good, especially the commentary.
0425170349|4.0|First, I enjoyed this novel.  It's garden variety Tom Clancy, including stereotyped characters that are all Overachievers, Republican, hold at least a Master's Degree in Something, and are Paragons of Physical Fitness...the story development and pacing, again, are typical Clancy.       All of that said...I wish one of his editors, preferably three or four novels back, would've had the temerity to say, \\"You know, Tom...that's the third time in as many sentences your character has clipped a pronoun or article in his speech...\\"  Here's a typical exchange between two of his characters  ( pick any one of his novels ):       \\"Hey, Bud; how's it hanging?\\"       \\"Good. You?\\"       \\"Been worse. Getting reassigned in May.\\"       \\"Going where?\\"       \\"Pentagon. Driving a desk. Could be worse.\\"  It would be so simple!  Just insert the pronoun 'I' about one hundred times throughout the typical, thousand-plus page book, along with a few articles such as 'the'...I served in the U.S. Army for more than a few years, and can personally attest to very few guys who actually talk that way, and ZERO females.  This may come across as cheap nit-picking to some avid fans, but it is my biggest pet peeve:  after two or three pages of \\"sociology block\\" narrative, you long for that \\"oasis\\" of conversation, and when it finally shows up, it's invariably two \\"Ranger Ricks\\" waxing macho!  I guess it struck me as a little ridiculous, too, when Clark's protege Ding Chavez, who early in this novel is depicted as running somewhere on the order of twenty miles a week is chided by his wife for eating a decadent breakfast of eggs, bacon and grits (!) Tom, you don't do women particularly well...especially one who's apparently oblivious to her husband's exercise routine.  Stay away from domestic/bedroom scenes, just as Stephen King should stay away from UFOs and the military. That advice, while certainly unsolicited, is free, since you've apparently long since cowed your editors into submission.        If the above criticisms don't get you wrapped around the axle, this one is a good read.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|This is a great movie that everyone should see at some point. It is so eye opening and is a classic story of the underdog winning out in the end. Highly recommended.
0156027321|1.0|I bought this book based upon the rave reviews here on Amazon.  I found the book to be tedious, the \\"message\\" to be highly derivative, and the storyline to be slow at best.  I had high expectations- clearly they were MUCH to high.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I was a POG in the Corp. years ago and a history buff, so maybe that's the reasons I enjoyed this so much.  I found it informative, educational and entertaining as well as bringing back memories.  The 7 part series was very well done from the \\"real grunts\\" point of view.  I rate it 5 stars and \\"R\\". I suggest watching 1 part then the \\"commentaries\\" for that part for fuller injoyment.  SemperFi
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|How bad can you get?  This was so boring, where is the story line?  He looks for his brother, they fall down a hole, sail across a ocean and gush up and are saved.  Where are the bad guys? One lame dinosaur? I was very disapointed in this movie, how about some action and they want to make a sequel?  Don't waste your money, buy the original [[ASIN:B00007JMD8 Journey to the Center of the Earth]] now that was entertaining.  Where's the duck?  Anyone who has seen the original knows what I am talking about.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Crossroads is an inspiring movie for all musicians. The character eugene martone has the passion for the blues but is torn by two masters. The blues and classical. By following his real calling he finds the one and only blind dog fulton(willie brown played by joe seneca) to help him record the 30th song that was missing on Robert Johnsons texas sessions. Although willie brown has his own reason to go back to the crossroads, eugene gets the mileage necessary to become the true bluesman he claims to be. The cast is solid and the music is amazing. Much coodos to Ry cooder and Steve Vai. I never get tired of watching this movie. I would highly recommend to all music enthusiast young and old.
B002708NAA|5.0|In years past, Pet Shop Boys have done albums that walked the fine line between pop and art.  This is due in no small part to combining addictive dance tunes to rather witty rhymes from Neil Tennant.  Not to mention, Tennant's a well read student of history, and his interests commonly creeps up into their songs, creating catchy little pieces of art.  This formula has worked for the boys since day one.    \\"Yes\\" is a little different, and not in a bad way.  After coming off of \\"Fundamental,\\" an album graced with a grandiose production whose content was frequently political, the boys take a breater with \\"Yes.\\"  The production is a little tighter, with the heavy strings chiming in only on \\"Legacy\\" and \\"All Over the World.\\"  This is courtesy of production team Xenomania.  The big difference however is the lyrical content.    Quite simply, \\"Yes\\" is a set of some of the most straightforward pop the Boys have ever delivered.  \\"Love etc.\\" is kind of the Boys take on \\"All you Need is Love,\\" containg a beat that is part electro, part swing -but all pop.  \\"All Over the World\\" is the album's most grand track.  It's a song about songs and the power of music.  It's one of the boys most upbeat tracks.    Highlights come in the form of experimentation, notably on \\"Building a Wall,\\" which is bridged by a spoken bit from Chris.  While the song might have a weaker backing track, the delivery makes it one of the more original tracks on the album.  This is all true with the \\"Way it Used to Be,\\" featuring Neil toying with vocal stylings on the end of the track.    Optimism lifts a couple other tracks here.  \\"Pandemonium\\" is a straightforward up tempo love song.  One of the most dancable tracks, it was written for kylie Minogue, though not recorded by her.  It sounds out of place on a PSB record, but works in this set.  It might be the happiest song the Boys have recorded.  Another great uptempo number hear is \\"More than a Dream,\\" which on a superficial level is about reaching potential, but as Tennant has stated, may have to do with the changing ranks in politics.    \\"Legacy\\" is probably the most topical song on the album.  It seems to have a very loose song structure, but features a string arrangement.  \\"Legacy\\" may apply to old politics, and the mark they've left on the future generations.  It contains all sorts of references to war, espinoage, neatly contrasting it with the ennui of daily life.  Not the most memorable melodically, but has some neat lyrical constructs.    While \\"Yes\\" may not be their best album, it may be thought of as the Pet Shop Boys best pop record.  As elder statesman of electronic pop music in Britain, they've been pretty consistent, as they are here.  This album is their most straightforward pop effort.  The bar is raised by Xenomania's production, giving a slick, tight sound that puts the Boys right up there with the best pop of today or in the past.
B0017KP93U|3.0|It's hard to tell... Is it a living music or a music for a living. It's a cold cold rock and there's no humanity in it. I was concerned by the title \\"Creep\\" but never though it could be so crap in the end. I can't figure out why so many people tells they're great. Yes, this is well produced, well played and recorded, but images that comes along are cold steel, dark cities and strong disturbance. Perfectly tight to this dying society.   Not my music at all.
B000I2IT44|5.0|The guy is simply a master, so are the other musicians. It is really a shame that this band is too often completely unknown to the average fan...   But wait: Wilson is 41 years old. So, let's hope that the best is yet to come!
B001IBIQU6|5.0|This album takes a while to get a hold of you, but once it does, look out!  The song arrangements are anything but typical; quite unique and complex.  I have a new favorite track every time I listen.  And I love that I can hear almost every other DM album on SOTU, which also sets a new standard for production of an electronic album using mostly analog sythns.  Leave it to DM to push the envelope.  And finally a BIG thanks to Martin and Dave for finally giving us a duet!  \\"Peace\\" is just wonderful.  Can't wait for the Tour!
B001TOD92C|4.0|I am no fan of wrestling. I find to be terribly tiresome and pointless. That said, I've enjoyed one other movie about the subject (\\"Beyond the Mat\\"), and was looking forward to this film due to the wonderful buzz around it.     The film itself is merely ok. It's not bad, but it's not anything special. It tells the story of a washed-up pro-wrestler (Mickey Rourke), whose body is finally giving out on him. He spends the movie just trying to get by until he get into the ring again, where he comes alive and exists as a person.     The direction is decent and the writing is good. It's quite fun seeing some of the \\"behind-the-scenes\\" stuff with the various wrestlers as they plan out their moves in an effort to keep it all as safe as possible.     As I said, it's not anything special, except that Mickey Rourke's performance is truly mind-blowing. Seriously, he disapears so completely into the role that you start feeling like you're watching a documentry, not a peice of fiction. I really cannot say enough about his work here; it's amazing, and along with \\"Sin City\\" shows that he's not just a pretty face. Er... well, you know what I mean.     Overall I'd recommend this movie, but it's one you'll probably watch more for Rourke than anything else.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Why are some people so unhappy with the ending? One review even goes so far as to say there is no ending. That's not true. The ending is just not the clear-cut, wrap-it-all-up-at-the-end type of climax that a lot of people are accustomed to seeing in today's cinema. The ending of \\"The Wrestler\\" requires you to THINK a little bit, just as other recent movies do, such as \\"Doubt\\". By movie's end, it's obvious that Mickey Rourke's character, Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson has nothing left to live for, except the adulation he receives from the crowd when he's in the ring. His relationship with his daughter has failed (again), and she doesn't want him in her life anymore. His desire to have a real relationship with Marisa Tomei's character (Cassidy, the stripper), also went unfulfilled and she basically dissed him in the bar. In addition, Randy is only a shell of his former self...he is forced to work at the deli counter of a supermarket and suffer verbal abuse at the hands of his supervisor. Wrestling is the only thing Randy has left. So he accepts the final match. And, while the ending requires some speculation on the part of the viewer, I think there are a number of indications as to what is going to happen to Randy. His doctor already warned him that his heart cannot take the pounding of another match, and if he does return to wrestling, he risks death. Sevearl times during the final match, Randy clutches his chest -- he even stumbles at one point.     The final straw is when he looks up into the crowd and sees that Cassidy has left -- you can see the hurt and disappointment in his face....and so, he decides to do his signature move, the \\"Ram Jam\\", where he jumps off the top rope and onto his opponent. Now, given all the \\"hints\\" in the final match which I just mentioned, I think it's pretty safe to assume that \\"The Ram\\" dies. Why do they have to show it? I think it leaves the character with some dignity to show him in the final frames doing what he does best, entertaining the crowd and being a hero to his many fans....rather than showing him in a crumpled heap on the mat.    As I mentioned, there is a similar situation with the movie \\"Doubt\\", which I just viewed last night. There is no clear-cut resolution in this movie either. You are not sure at the end whether the minister (Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character) has actually done what the nun (Meryl Streep's character) has accused him of doing -- had an improper relationship with one of the students in the school. Interestingly, in the Special Features section of this DVD, Meryl Streep talks about this exact issue. \\"Doubt\\" is based on a play, and Streep said that theatre-goers are a lot more open and accepting of endings which are not clear-cut. Movie-goers, however, are for the most part accustomed to seeing all the loose ends neatly wrapped up at the end.     Anyway, I loved this movie and it will stay with me for a long time. As someone who is also in middle-age and in the middle of a career change/crisis, and no longer employed in my chosen profession, I can totally relate to Ram's feelings of being \\"lost\\" and useless and that his glory days are behind him. I too have a daughter, and while we are not estranged like the characters in \\"The Wrestler\\" are, my daughter lives a fair distance from me and I can relate to The Ram's pain. Yes, he brought it upon himself, by making wrestling his priority over his family, but his failed efforts to restore their relationship (he screws up again), really tug at the heartstrings. He is just basically a nice guy who can't seem to do anything right -- except in the ring.
B001UE276A|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet because the first review is very good and in-depth.  Plan and simple a lot of thought and care went into this amazing deluxe edition.  The demo disc alone is worth it.  But the books and the DVD is what makes this really a great piece.  $72.50 the day it came out.  BUY IT NOW.  :)
B0011EU0NG|1.0|I read this book to my kids and we all loved it.  The movie, however, was cringingly bad -- I consider it a horror flick for kids.  Beware if you think your children would be disturbed by a character that goes around stealing children and putting them in a cage.
B000WMXZ4Y|3.0|All I can say about this album is that it is nice....(damning it with faint praise, really).  I simply hear a faded rerun of Cloud Nine with out much spark or punch.  Not bad, but certainly not great. There are much better picks out there unless you are a die hard George/Beatle fan. (And this is a far cry from any of George's Beatle works...)
B001QB9H1K|3.0|The movie itself wasn't worth it but the service was great...the item was pre-ordered and arrived within the next 2 days and wasn't expected to get to me until four days after it was purchased.
B0000042HV|5.0|Although a great symphonist it is Shostakovich's original and personal quartets that have always impressed me the most about this Russian composing genius.  Now we get all 15 in one compact and very well packaged set performed brilliantly by the Fitzwilliam String Quartet as well.  The sound quality is also very, very good thanks to a brilliant sound engineering and production job; the acoustics at the All Saints Church in Surrey, England where this was recorded must be fantastic to produce such a great sound experience!<br /><br />The Quartets here for those not already familiar with the composer's works can be an acquired taste for some as they bear little if any resemblence to the quartets one usually hears from composers like Beethoven and Schubert and can even sound extremely discordant at times reflecting the intended inner turmoil or moods the composer wants to portray.  In fact, at some points the soundtrack/score to the Hitchcock movie \\"Psycho\\" comes to mind.  Still, Shostakovich's work with his quartets is important in the new, unchartered waters he allowed this format to stretch out into reminding me a lot of how Ornette Coleman or even Thelonius Monk for example stretched the accepted jazz format at the time to discover new horizons at least in the expressiveness of the genre if not so much in making wholesale changes to the genre in itself.<br /><br />For this reason, I never tire of listening to this set of quartets and you'd be hard pressed to find a better recording and collection than what you have here.  Included in this very well put together cardboard box set is a 44-page booklet which contains the track listings together with an essay on all 15 quartets by Alan George in English, French and German.  Each of the 6 discs are well-housed in well-designed cardboard square sleeves as well making this overall my favourite classical music box set of my entire collection.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of \\"modern\\" classical music!
B001DO2N8Y|5.0|This album freed me from my Bach obsession decades ago and still is one of my favorites. With the richness of the orchestration, the wonderful darkness and the intros of Last Dance, Prayers For Rain and The Same Deep Water As You, this album's depth and beauty is almost painful. A timeless masterpiece, this is the Cure.
0790729725|3.0|This film is certainly one of Scorcese's best although to say it matches the calibre of Coppola's work on \\"The Godfather I &/or II\\" would be stretching it.  It's a good film though that's based on a true story and succeeds admirably in portraying a no-holds-barred story of what life in the mafia is like and is like a good adjunct to the whole \\"Godfather\\" franchise.<br /><br />This dvd version though isn't perfect as although the sound quality is good and sounded like it was a Dolby 5.1 Surround setup on my system but the picture quality hasn't been restored leaving a lot of frames with those irritating white spots.  I note that a Blu-ray version has been released and so here's hoping they took the opportunity to clean up the picture quality a little bit more.  No special features of note here as well but overall, if you don't mind the few picture imperfections and if you are not into the making-of documentaries or cast interviews then this dvd version should suffice.<br /><br />My recommendation though is to get the Blu-ray version but if you need to get the standard version, this dvd will do if you can do without the extras.<br /><br />Updated 17 July 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not let me review this separately I'll have to do this here: the blu-ray release is definitely an improvement over the dvd release I reviewed above but as far as comparison with other blu-ray releases that are out there this ranks as average.  The good thing is that they got rid of virtually all the white spots although the vertical scratch line on De Niro's face is still there but overall at least picture quality-wise we get a vast improvement over the dvd.  Sound-wise the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround is still good but not a great deal better than the dvd release.  The Special Features section is vastly improved over the dvd with making-of documentaries and even a short interview with the real Henry Hill.  Overall this is much better than the dvd release but it is not perfect and hopefully they will release a future blu-ray version in a nifty digibook format and a more perfect picture quality soon.<br /><br />Verdict: mixed bag but definitely better than the standard dvd release.blu-ray version in a nifty digibook format and a more perfect picture quality soon.    Verdict: mixed bag but definitely better than the standard dvd release.
B0000028M7|5.0|Exceptional album!  Solid riffs, amazing vocals and great meaningful lyrics!  Easily one of the best bands from that scene!
B001K3JF7K|2.0|I consider myself to be a serious Diana Krall fan. Her \\"Live from Paris\\" and \\"the Look of Love\\" albums have been played countless times in our home, for example. But I agree with many of the other reviewers here: she simply doesn't have the forte, if you will, to create a true bossa nova classic. Indeed, this is far from it.    I especially miss the truly exceptional talent she possesses for tickling the ivories. It's definitely not on display here.... Which was one of my biggest disappointments with this album.    The recording qualities of this album are, however, quite exceptional. I understand that there are others who have found the studio-recording qualities to be questionable; this has simply not been the case with my Rotel and Thiel setup. From the first few seconds of the first track there was quite a lush quality to the sound.
B001EXE2ZG|3.0|This review is for the November 2008 Centennial release. This issue is a mixed bag. The picture is sharp, but the contrast is quite a bit darker. In some scenes the effect is very good and in quite a few other scenes, I found it a bit too dark. The November 2002 release was done with the services of Lowry Digital, the same service that did the recent James Bond restoration work with excellent results. Comparing the two, The 2002 release done by Lowry Digital was very good and didn't really need any improvement since there was very little if anything to improve. Rather than re-shuffling the same product over and over, it has been quite some time since Paramount has done anything new with their classic catalog. Paramount has not released new product from their classic catalog in years. For those of you who have the 2002 release, there is no need to buy the Centennial, so keep the current copy that you have.
B000NIVJGI|3.0|Bought for my wife for Easter.  Classic movie.  However I didn't notice a big difference with this Blu-Ray compared to regular DVD.  If you like this movie, I would recommend for the price.
B001IBIQU6|2.0|If I was a lawyer and was trying to defend Depeche Mode in court as a fantastic, still-relevant band, I would not want this album introduced as evidence. As much I have grown to enjoy \\"Wrong\\", while listening to the rest of the album throughout the day, I just found myself wanting to listen to something else, barely making it through the first listen. I first got \\"Some Great Reward\\" over 20+ years ago and have loved Depeche Mode ever since, which is what makes this such a let down. Their last few haven't been their best, but this is a huge disappointment. I found myself wanting to instead listen to Dave Gahan's second solo album halfway through as it seemed more like what this album should have been.  It is as if they wanted to recycle themselves and become the band everyone who hated them or wasn't a fan thought they were. The album is mired in electronic noodling which was never really what made them who they were. I agree with a previous commenter's statement that a lot probably has to do with their new producer, so if they can hold it together for one more album, please let them find someone who can make up for this. Get Daniel Miller or Flood (or both) and give us one more we can smile into old age to.
B001QB9H10|3.0|Transporter 3 was pretty good, Not as good as the previous 2 though. There could have been more thought put into the story line.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I don´t want to expand too much in things you need to try for your self.    Just keep this in mind...... this is important and relevant.  The work Depeche just did will shut you up. It´s a personal ride.    This is one of the best albums of the band and a proud statement of what they are all about.    Enough!!!!!
B001PPGAIA|1.0|If this movie had been animated, or an anime movie, it might have been just bearable, but even then I doubt it. The script is infantile, the story is a collection of Clich&eacute;s of the worst kind, the cinematography has been digitally altered so much that it does not look real. The acting is horrendous, but this could be due to the comic book script. I can't believe this got made at all. I am in shock, it is that bad. I am an Australian, and this movie is nothing about the real Australia. Some Holly wood executive who has never stepped foot in Australia has taken 30 seconds to scribble this movie idea on a piece of toilet paper and has tried to make a cross between the corniest parts of The Wizard of OZ and an attempt at the humor of Batman (the old TV series), and has failed.
0374264260|5.0|I've never met a character like Pat Peoples before, and now that I have, I won't forget him.  This story is funny and sad, wonderfully endearing, slightly mysterious, and equal parts sacred and profane.  The author has a distinctive voice, one utterly without pretense.      We meet Pat on the day he is being discharged from a mental health facility into the care of his mother.  Pat is obsessed with reconciling with his estranged wife and everything he does has a single focus -- to bring about the end of \\"apart time\\" (as he calls it).      As the story unfolds, we begin to understand Pat and he begins to understand himself.  One has the odd sensation of helping him along as we read along. If we stop reading, what will become of Pat? (That feeling probably explains why I literally could not stop reading this book until, alas, there was no more to read.)      The descriptions of male friendship are brilliant, and the supporting characters equally vivid.  Buy this book!  It is a great read.
B000EQ47HC|5.0|Most of the time without question I go for a music that tends to be deep in thought or feeling. But there's no question this almost too easy to find album is still a lot of fun. What you'll find yourself getting here is 33 minutes of....pure classic hard rock. Big guitars,big singers,big harmonies and big anthemic hooks purely for the sake of it-no pretentious need to TRY make some big point-it's basic rock for the fun of it,THAT'S the point! \\"Don't Look Back\\" is just one of those tunes that you can really rock out to at a party.\\"The Man I'll Never Be\\" is the slower and more sensative of the two starting as kind of a ballad while \\"It's Easy\\",\\"Feelin' Satisified\\",\\"Party\\" and \\"Used To Be Bad News\\" are just all full of fun and the love of life. \\"Don't Be Afraid\\" is kind of a variation on the title but has this really nice,kind of funky drum breakdown at the end. I will not but this as part of the music that saved it's era from disco because there was nothing to be saved from.Disco was born of funk and funk NEVER sucks so how could disco? That's my view on that but for it's place in rock n roll history this is a great little rock album that's full of life;great to party two or get you up,roused and moving on a dreary day!
0060920084|4.0|Bill Bryson published this book twenty years ago in 1989.  Not long ago, and obviously many of the concepts about American culture and lifestyle described in \\"The Lost Continent\\" not only continue to exist to today, but are even more enhanced and pervasive.  In author Bill Bryson, I saw myself.  I have already looked through the eyes of Bryson.  My perceptions were not as negative as his, but I noticed many things the author did as well.      A lot of this book's focus, is subjective perception.  And these perceptions are after Bryson recently returned to the US.  Over time, his perceptions likely adapted and he got used to his surroundings.  I see Reverse Culture Shock in this book.  I've had RCS myself.      Bryson's perceptions and critiques are shared by many Americans that live abroad and then return to the USA.  Bryson perceived his native country in a different way, after having lived in Britain for years.  Such observations with \\"fresh eyes,\\" a different mentality, or changes of perception are very, very, common upon returning.  I've experienced this and know many people who have felt the same way.  Feelings of being a \\"stranger in a familiar land,\\" perhaps.  Being more critical.  Disliking certain things that you never even thought about nor considered, before you left your country.  These different perceptions about our native cultures would not occur if we hadn't left to live overseas.    Born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa, Bryson spends time describing life there growing up and also returning to observe the changes of his home-town.  He noted the staunch and loud political partisanship by a neighbor, when he was young.  Polarization that still exists, or is even more pervasive today, in the United States.  In this book the journey starts and ends in...Des Moines.  Symbolic perhaps, and sentimental.    One quote that summed up the author's experience on his journey through the US, focuses particularly on Des Moines: \\"There are three things you just can'tdo in life.  You can't beat the phone company, you can't make a waiter see you until he's ready to see you, and you can't go home again.\\"    Bryson has the knack to explain with appropriate detail and narrate with well-put wit.  One of my faves are \\"that's not true.  I made it up,\\" when he explains a joke he writes.  Few authors do this.    Bryson's Observations: not negative, just different.  And shared by many.    He spent time on the road in the US.  This means, eating out.  He would go to many franchise restaurants and notice particular things, perhaps moreso because he'd been living in Britain for several years.  He observed that \\"all around me people were eating pizzas the size of wheels....the menu was dazzling in variety.  It went on for pages....\\" (Page 63).  He noted how big people had gotten and how much they could eat, as the portions were so large.  And since this book was written 20 years ago, obesity levels have risen significantly.      He then observed the number #1 American pastime: shopping.     The author walked into large malls, department stores, and supermarkets.  Here is a description of K-Mart:     \\"K-Marts are a chain of discount stores and they are really depressing places.  You could take Mother Theresa to to a K-Mart and she would get depressed.\\"  He notes the stores themselves are not depressing.  It's the customers that shop there: Every woman there as has least 4 children and they all look as if they have been fathered by a different men.  The woman always weighs 250 pounds She is always walloping a child and bawling 'if you don't behave Ronnie, I 'm not gonna bring you back here no more.' As if Ronnie could ever give a toss about going to K-Mart again.\\"    Bryson seemed a bit negative towards the Southern part of the US.  He noted historical occurrences of the past and nuanced them to his perceptions of places and people in the region, on his journey.  He didn't particularly like Mississippi.    When a person lives away from the their home-country the length of time that Bryson did, there are often varying degrees and depths of Reverse Culture Shock.  Reverse Culture Shock is a phenomenon that does exist and has been studied extensively.      Contrary to many others that have read this book, I didn't laugh, and I didn't find it funny.  But I did find it good.  I've read other, more cheery works by Bill Bryson and he's still one of my favorites.
B001CQONKY|4.0|It's hard to mess up the product when buying it brand new. It was in perfect condition. However it was on back order, and it didn't tell me until after the order was processed.

B00008PW2D|4.0|The fifth season of the vastly entertaining \\"Sex and the City\\" features eight funny, sexy, and occasionally poignant episodes of New York chic-ness.  In other words, if you've seen the previous seasons, there's no reason not to keep plowing ahead to the series' big close in season six (well, the big close until the movie that eventually followed).  And contrary to some of the comments here on Amazon, season five is indeed priced lower than the other seasons due to its shorter length.  To be fair, maybe the price reduction is a recent development.  In any event, you can use the money you save to help spring for a good Chardonnay to sip while watching the girls confront dating troubles, baby issues (Miranda's little Brady sure is a cutie, endless crier or not), and engage in a memorable debate about whether Nathan Lane's lounge act piano player is gay or not.  All frothy and all fun.  After all, you can't just watch Henry VIII execute people on \\"The Tudors\\" all the time, as fun as fun as that can be, too.
1603580557|4.0|Ms. Meadows has written an intriguing book.  Some parts of it, like \\"A Brief Visit to the Systems Zoo,\\" were confusing for me, but that was probably just me.  Some chapters were fascinating and clear, like the one on Escalation.<br /><br />There's a lot in this book, some of it surprising, but try as I might I could not read it without wishing I had a degree in Systems or at least Sociology or at the very least Business.  I found the generalizations sometimes too abstract for my brain, which needs hard core examples, and graphs are not my favorite thing.<br /><br />I did take away from the book the thought that many of its ideas were important ones for those involved in dealing with how the world works in a techno-eco-political sense and more.  I did rather enjoy her asides, especially this one:  \\"If A causes B, is it possible that B also causes A?\\"  My money's on them both.
B0002DB52M|5.0|When I first uncovered the book, in it's packaging, I expected to find a rather used book.  I was, however, surprised to find that, not only was the book well protected in the mailing, but it appeared brand new. I am extremely pleased with this transaction, and thank everyone concerned in making this purchase worth waiting for.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|We were happy with the purchase of the \\"Rocky\\" DVD's and next gift time we will buy the \\"Rambo\\" series...Thanks    GYM
0553277472|5.0|It's a great book. And I was pleased with the condition that I recieved it in, considering it was quite old and used.
0316017922|3.0|Being new to this particular slant on the topic of success, I enjoyed gaining new insights from Outliers.  Gladwell shares how research appears to indicate that success can often be attributed more to a person's  background, opportunities, and time spent in practice (at least 10,000 hours), rather than innate talent, IQ, or anything else.      However, the books diverts annoyingly off-topic when Gladwell spends a ridiculous amount of time giving encyclopedic descriptions of micro-cultures, with related stories containing so much detail and explanation that you lose track of whatever point he is trying to make.      I don't think it's an over-statement to say that Gladwell succumbed to the need to create filler - in order for an otherwise 40-page book to somehow reach book length.  Perhaps he should have broadened the topic, or done more individual case studies, as opposed to spending an inordinate number of pages relaying information which does little to further one's understanding of his main points.     It's like watching a two-hours movie with 20 minutes of story broken into segments and spaced between an hour-and-a-half of background commentary. It's a great story, but sitting through the commentary almost ruins it.
B001TCAT9U|5.0|I bought this newest installation from the best band on earth the very second it came out.  Every single song is \\"ear candy\\".  One of the best songs they have ever done has to be \\"Miles Away/The Truth Is\\".  I've been a fan of Depeche Mode since 1983 and I can tell you, this CD doesn't disappoint whatsoever!!  I just ordered the Sounds of the Universe Box Set and I cannot wait for it to arrive on my doorstep.  Enjoy all you diehard Depeche Fans!!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|HOW WONDERFUL!  And I under-estimated, and somewhat let the reviews and description of this CD, make me DOUBT that I wanted to get this album.<br /><br />I am stunned, my jaw dropped, as truly Enya has done it again!  And I try to hear a loss of quality or a misplayed note.  Yet she is too perfect.  Sometimes I ask myself is she even human?<br /><br />People who have never heard anything about Enya will always turn, and stop what they're doing to ask: \\"who is that singing\\"<br />The least I have hear them say is \\"wow, pretty cool\\"<br /><br />And these are the everyday common people!  How can you NOT be touched!<br />I am a fan for life and of course I know that where I put my money is something that its WORTH my money.  This is REAL MUSIC.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I'm not going to write an actual review because it looks like everyone has commented on everything worthwhile pertaining to this CD.  I just wanted to suggest that everyone look up the lyrics to Rosetta Stoned... hilarious.  Only Tool could pull off something like that and make it sound so sincere.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Finally, I have been waiting on this for years.  All 6 classic TOS Star Trek movies on Blu-ray in sweet HD.  I thought fans would be thrilled!!...boy how I was surprised to hear all the DC whining.    Paramount could have really dragged this out, by releasing all 6 spread out over time instead of all in one set.  For anyone who got in at $75.99 or $79.99, great deal for Blu-rays at this time.  Only $13.33 a movie!!  Spreading this out with each movie being released separately would have nickel & dimmed us with greater prices per movie.    Note: Theatrical releases of movies are where it's at.  I give you Star Wars for example:  Only the LD definitive collection version is original theater cuts.  To never come out with them on DVD is very annoying.  Yes, I understand folks would like both versions available, but this set has 12 hours of extras & a 7th disc of new material.  Please give it a rest!    Maybe whining takes center stage all too often b/c folks have to be angry to post sometimes.  Also, funny how reviews are posted prior to anyone actually seeing the HD Blu-ray of Star Trek TOS.      Rumor is the picture & sound are great.  Let's all hope for that as fellow fans of Trek.    ---------------------------  Simple if you need to have DC then wait for it.  I don't understand why people are in such a tiff about 9 min of footage.  This is not, I repeat NOT, LOTRs with hours of adds and changes.    DC differences:  The Trek I net 4 min add.  Versions are so different as to make a list nearly impossible.  In general about 4 minutes of footage was cut from the theatrical in the Director's cut. Then about 4 minutes were added to the movie of mostly character bits (Spock crying, Kirk ordering destruct etc.) Some new FX were added to the Dir. cut along with a lot of new sound FX. A longer opening music entre' acte was added and the DC has longer end credits as well. The credits were changed from white lettering to gold. The DC is actually 4 min longer than the theatrical, but seems shorter because the scenes that were cut were mostly non dialogue FX flyby shots and the scenes added in were character driven dialogue stuff.    For Trek II their are 8 changes that amount to 3 min 30 sec.  1. Extension of Kirk/McCoy talking about glasses.  2. Intro of Preston as Scott's nephew in engineering alternate extended take.  3. Extension of Chekov and Carol talking about the order to take Genesis  4. Alternate extended take of carol preparing to hide Genesis from Chekov (Khan)  5. Extension of Spock/McCoy debating Genesis  6. Extension of Preston's death & Kirk/McCoy discussing Khan etc  7. Kirk telling Spock that David is his son in the 'Jeffries' tube.  8. Kirk & Spock telling Saavik about the 'human ego'.    For Trek VI there are 4 changes that amount to 3 min 26 seconds.  1. The Operation Retrieve sequence in the presidents office with Sarek Col West, the CinC & Ad Cartwright  2. Spock, Scott & Valeris in the torbedo storage bay discussing the new Klingon Chancellor.  3. Scott in the dining hall looking at blueprints (no dialogue)  4. The unmasking of the shooter, exposed as Col. West
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Movie came in a timely fashion.  Not one of the best James Bond movies but I liked it anyway.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|Don't listen to all the negative reviews on this album, it's a great album, and it really shows the bands desire to continue to grow. I really liked the lyrics and concepts in this album, and wrong kind of sets the tone for things to come.<br /><br />Invest in this and it will do the same for you, I assure you.
B0026GBIB6|3.0|I'm a DM fan, and they have their fair share of spots on my list of favorite songs. However, I am disappointed in this effort. The production is pretty good (as it always is), but the songs themselves tend to get boring, and the tunes just aren't there. I also just bought the Pet Shop Boys new album \\"Yes,\\" and I think it's a much better choice. The tunes are far better and more addictive. The last DM song I really loved was \\"It's no good,\\" and I was hoping this one would have one or two more good songs (\\"Wrong\\" is ok).
B00002DF4X|5.0|This is my second copy of this awsome CD. Its great listening and a nice mix of easy, relaxing music. I literally wore out my first copy. Often listen to it while driving and thoroughly enjoy the fabulous songs on it. I would highly recommend it.
B002708NAA|5.0|Pet Shop Boys have done it again. Their material was brilliant from Please through Very, but they lost their way a bit with Bilingual, Nightlife, and Release. Their last album, 2006's Fundamental was a return to form, and Yes is even better. It really is some fantastic music. Great songs, catchy production, a brilliant piece of work. These guys have to be one of the top groups of all time.
B00000IFP6|3.0|Like the period sets, Zinman plays with Beethoven's fast metronome markings. Beethoven was never a big fan of the metronome, he himself said (and I quote from wikipedia): \\"100 according to Maelzel, but this must be held applicable to only the first measures, for feeling also has its tempo and this cannot entirely be expressed in this figure.\\" Zinman is probably the first conductor following Beethoven's metronome markings to use his common sense and not follow the markings down to the dot. The result is a much better flow of music than the other period sets (for example Gardiner).    However, the low budget sound of this set is obvious: most HIP/semi HIP sets nowadays play with a smaller orchestral, but I have never heard a set which sounds as small as Zinman's. At times it feels like I am listening to chamber music, and the power that the orchestral provides is rather pathetic. This is especially true for the Symphony no. 9, which suffers too from less than stellar vocals.     For the price it's still a great set, I'll rather spend on this than crappy Gardiner who conducts as if he wants to finish the recording ASAP. However, it's still far away from the \\"reference\\" set that some here are making it out to be.
1416914307|5.0|Absolutely beautiful pretty much sums it up.  A perfect ending to a perfect series *well with the exception that i didn't want it to end and i could read for the rest of eternity about jace and clary* I laughed, i screamed, and I cried.  Move over Romeo and Juliet cause Jace and Clary are taking your place for the future!!    Fingers crossed that CC changes her mind and writes just one more novel about jace and clary!!!! *please please please please please*
0399246665|4.0|This is a great box set.  The kids love it!  Great teaching tool.
B000002KDO|5.0|Master of Reality is only 8 songs (2 of which are guitar solos: Orchid and Embrya). But the rest of the album rocks. There is one mellow song that I always liked: Solitude which is sung by the drummer Bill Ward. After forever is one of Sabbaths best rockin tunes and very underated as far as radio play goes.Tony Iommi really got his guitar set up just right as he comes through with some of his heaviest- pulsating guitar work of  his career.Master of Reality is my favorite sabbath/ozzy era album of all time. Crank it up to 10 !
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This vidcast was recommended to me by a dear friend, whose taste I trust.  I watched it on my laptop, then promptly ordered it on Amazon.com.  I grew up watching many mad scientist-themed movies, and this homage was adorable.  The songs are cleverly written; this is something I appreciated.  The cast displayed the correct amount of satire in their delivery, and the characters are likeable.  It is obvious that this little spoof was fun to work on.  If you like musicals, mad scientists and/or Neil Patrick Harris, you will want to get this DVD.
B000URWYTS|1.0|I am very surprised by all the positive reviews.  I found neither of the main characters the least bit sympathetic or interesting.   They were self-absorbed and selfish people.  Frank and Mamah not only deserted their children but Mamah used people.   She left her children with a friend who was in ill health and had just given birth, then relied on her husband and sister to raise her children.
B0009SOFGI|2.0|The remastered version sounds better than the first time around.  Still, Cale had no idea what he had here.  And there are still only 2 good songs here.  The rest is boring.  Seeing them live in 1969 wouldn't have been, I'm sure.  Fun House and Raw Power are probably the two greatest rock records ever.  Just listen to those and construct imaginary versions of I Wanna Be Your Dog and No Fun as recorded on one of those instead of buying this.
0446677450|1.0|I actually never got this book can you please reply why i never got this book thankl.

B001UE276A|4.0|Every time a new DM record comes out, I get that warm, comfortable feeling that for a moment, everything is okay.  Kind of like with U2.  And like U2, they've put out new music that covers a span of styles and moods from throughout their long and storied career.  \\"Sounds of the Universe\\" is far from breaking any new ground, but it's still a great record.  You have to laud them for treading the line between familiar and derivative; fortunately they lean to the former.  \\"Sounds\\" at one point reminds me of the old, old days and the next, a seeming leftover from \\"Playing the Angel.\\"  The hardest thing for a veteran band nowadays is retaining relevance; a band can come out with a new disc as an excuse to do a tour.  The disc does poorly, gets minimal airplay, but cleans up on the road. (Think: the Rolling Stones.)  DM is still relevant by giving us music that's different yet comforting.  And they do it without sounding too retro or kitschy.  Radiohead has been criticized for being all beeps and bloops the last few years but has made a distinct sound out of it and fans now love and expect it.  DM can't be catching onto that \\"retro\\" sound because, simply, they helped create the damn thing.        I won't bother with dissecting each and every song and its lyrical meaning.  That's up to you.  But I will tell you that overall, it's an entertaining and moving album.  \\"Sounds\\" is meant for longtime and/or serious fans, as there's not much here for today's rapid-fire churned out internet-downloadable junk that'll be forgotten next week.  And thank God for that.  I want something I won't be tired of a year from now.        All of this leads me to explain why (or why not) the uber-box set is worth buying.  I bought it for the b-sides, re-mixes, and demos.  They're easy to listen to and moody (DM wouldn't have it any other way, would they?) without being of the \\"ugh...b-sides...\\" persuasion.  Sometimes B-sides are better than the album, but they just don't fit flow with the other tracks.  Intrinsically they are wonderful to hear.  (The Cure's \\"Halo\\" is a perfect example.)  Think of deleted scenes on DVDs: almost all of us have watched one and said \\"Why'd they take that out? That was awesome!\\"  Well, they were good but just didn't work in the bigger picture.        The B's presented here, like the main disc, seem to span the stylistic breadth of DM's career.  Case in point: \\"Oh Well\\" sounded to me like it came from the \\"Violator\\" sessions but got lost like car keys, only to be found later and rejoiced.  The re-mixes are not the typical upbeat, dance-y technotripe that so many CD singles contain; these are just as moody and atmospheric as the originals, albeit longer and a bit trippier.  Like any good proper re-mix, they contain elements of the original for familiarity's sake but sound, for lack of a better term, different.  The re-mix of \\"Jezebel\\" slithers its way into an electronic version of a snake charming backdrop.  I liked it just as much as the original.        I'm a sucker for any group that puts out a disc of demos, old versions, remakes, etc.  They're fun from a serious fan's perspective of seeing how songs start and evolve to become the polished track we all come to know and love.  It all started with the Beatles and now it seems everybody's aping the concept.  Why DM?  One could accuse them of just filling out a box set with leftovers and rough tracks.  I said this box set was intended for superfans.  That's why I plunked down $80 for it.        To be honest, I didn't consider the DVD of videos and making of, or the two books when purchasing it.  The books feel like they belong on a coffee table to impress guests, with photos by longtime chronicler Anton Corbijn.  I perused, was impressed with the artistic value, and promptly put them back in the box.  There have been so many \\"making of\\" books, videos, pamphlets, kabuki plays, and papyrus scrolls relating to modern music that nothing's new here.  It's just DM.  The one funny highlight I got out of them was seeing how closely Martin Gore resembles the guy who played J.F. Sebastian in \\"Blade Runner.\\"        The most important thing to consider in buying this box set is simple: do you want to throw down the chunk of change to get b-sides, re-mixes, and documentation?  It's not about their value, really.  At first I fooled myself into thinking I could wait until they put out the same set sans books and DVD.  Then I realized I was too impatient for that and dove in.  I'm glad I did, because like I said the music is totally worth it.  I just wish they could have been a wee more compact about the packaging.  I need the free space for the next fan-friendly box set they release.
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|This is a great movie. Vampire movies are really hot now. Great quality movie. I recommend it.
0316010669|4.0|We are at a point in time when the interaction period between two people is shortening and information passes between two people at an increasingly rapid rate.  The global reach of individuals is now extensive and continues to grow with technology. Due to these advancement in interaction between people, first impressions are imperative.    In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell, composes an astounding analysis and study of first impressions.  Referred to as \\"thin-slicing\\", Gladwell cites dozens of examples of situations that, for better or worse, were greatly changed due to thin-slicing and first impressions.     This book is a must-read.  It flows very smoothly.  Gladwell has the ability to extend profound knowledge while keeping a conversational vocabulary.  This makes it interesting and educational to everyone, which is quite important because an underlying theme to this book is that thin-slicing is something everybody should consider.  Gladwell also keeps the analysis flowing smoothly by using dozens of everyday examples to which everyone can relate.    My understanding of the conclusion in Blink is that there are two types of quick decision-making that should be used in two different ways.  First, there is instinctive decision making.  This is often done subconsciously.  Gladwell argues that this should be used in very large, quick-decision matters, such as choosing a mate, deciding on a job, or even life-and-death decisions.  These also work best in areas where you have been trained and tested extensively.  If you are a policeman and have been shot at many times, when you are shot at again, you are better off trusting your instincts rather than thinking through the situation.     On the other hand, if you are not trained and tested to make an important decision (such as shooting back at someone shooting at you), you may be better off trying to think it through correctly.  Thinking it through carefully is the second type of first-reaction decision making.  Gladwells argument as I understand it is that if the decision is fairly simple and straightforward, then it can be of greater reward to think it through.  A decision such as what attire to wear to a job interview is probably best done after a bit of thought or even testing (what does your roommate think of your outfit).    While these two conclusions are important to understand, I do not give them the justice they deserve.  His book is written to explain every part of these decisions.  Most importantly, he dives into facial expression first impressions and social recognition, which is extremely interesting.  He even explains how most of us hold a racial bias, whether we think we are racist or not.  He studies the subconscious from a very broad, simple, research-proven stance.    This book will improve your life.  Although it may only be for breif periods of realized decision-making, it is worth understanding when those decisions are life-changing.
0307277453|4.0|I am, naturally, the kind of person given to spending hours at a time staring at my hand and wondering at its complexity, its formation, and how every molecule within me came from elsewhere, even the hearts of far of suns... etc. And, to a large extent, Your Inner Fish gave great insight into the workings and development of the human body.<br />However - and this is a big however - the use of allegory throughout the book was so poorly done and so often used that every time one came up I about screamed. In fact, of the nearly thousand allegories in the book, the only useful one comes where he's talking about the nerves in the brain and he sights an old house that's been updated with new wires and plumbing many times over. The rest are, largely, unnecessary to anyone with a high school biology course to their name and, as this book isn't likly to be targeted to middle-schoolers anytime soon, they can be easily removed.<br />Given all of this though, Your Inner Fish, especially the second half, is an amazingly detailed and highly interesting book well worth the read, even if it shows its faults by being a best seller...
1580084621|4.0|this is a beautiful book.  almost destined more for the coffee table than for the kitchen library.    recipes are there, but there seems to be a very strong emphasis on recipe context. not an exhaustive resource by far - but is very nice to have anyway.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is the most amazing vampire story.  Very subtle and creative.  I highly recommend it!
0312360266|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  And yes, I've read Twilight.  And yes, I'm reading the Black Dagger Brotherhood.  And I've read Interview with the Vampire.  I love vampires.  Really do.<br /><br />Zoey's character is charming and refreshingly positive.  I love the good girl vs. bad girl thing.  I love all the Pagan and naturalistic beliefs sprinkled in there.  I love a sweet little twist in this world where vampires have always existed.  And I loved cheering for Zoey while hating Aphrodite.  And the implications at the end with the vision.<br /><br />If you don't like the book you don't have to be mean.  You have to take the book for what it is, written for teenagers but fun for adults too.  A light but fun read, and I will admit my 27-year old behind couldn't put it down until I finished it.
0240810961|5.0|Each \\"lesson\\" of this major work will provide the reader/artist with what it takes to be successful in this field.  The more than 400 pages in Volume 1 are jam packed with easy-to-read information that can only help the artist learn,and improve.  It covers the basics of animation, anatomy, sticking to themes, action analysis, one picture is worth a thousand words, fine tuning, gestures, and much, much more.  You don't have to be an \\"artist\\" to find this work interesting. There is an addtional work by Mr. Stanchfield.  This first volume is \\"The Place\\" to start.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Writing a \\"critical\\" review of this movie would be an exercise in futility. This film is a throwback to the ensemble productions of the 1930s. A bunch of very talented people, some of whom are inconceivable in these roles, all coming together and having a great time together.<br /><br />  Everything works, even the parts that don't.<br /><br />  It's a silly plot line (a young girl on the eve of her wedding trying to find who of three men is her father), the singing is often - to be polite - strained, some of the veteran thespians couldn't dance too well - but who cares?<br /><br />  This movie is just plain fun.<br /><br />  Relax, enjoy, tap your toes in time with the music and forget about the world and its woes for a little while.<br /><br />Jerry
B001PPGAJY|5.0|Watching this film again made me realize just how good X2 really was. The story, which takes place after the events of the original X-Men, is no slouch. Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) is coping with his origins, Jean-Grey(Famke Janseen) has those nasty headaches, Xavier(played wonderfully by Patrick Stewart) is still the strong father figure, Cyclops still stands around, and we are introduced to one of the coolest characters to grace a film adaptation of a comic book series, Nightcrawler. The film also introduces a rather... \\"human\\" villain, Stryker, which has a dastardly plan to eliminate all of our heroes. The plot is complex, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, and the pace is fast, making sure all of the audience is kept intrigued. I personally enjoyed X2 far more than \\"The Last Stand\\", and for good reason. Director Bryan Singer has a knack to make some of the most bland scenes fun and tense, and all of the battles or actions scenes really never get old, specifically the beginning of the film with Nightcrawler. The Blu-Ray is one of the finest representations I have seen yet! The colors are spot-on, the black levels are inky, and the contrast is never blown out. The DTS-HD MA is also a great mix, with surrounds used to wonderful effect. Dialogue is never an issue, and the bass is definitely powerful. Skip to the scene where the \\"Invaders\\" go into the institute, and you will hear exactly what I mean. Overall, a great movie on an excellent Blu-Ray, boasting a beautiful, steely transfer, and a theater-like audio. IMO, this is the X-Men movie to watch and own on Blu-Ray!
B001R10BM8|3.0|For years I have had questions about Never Say Never Again that remained unanswered for lack of special features or director's commentary to explain some of the elements in this film. Finally, we hear from the director and a Bond historian about many of the backstories about how this renegade Bond film was made, and the many challenges the producers had to overcome to complete this film. I never realized just how much of a nail-biter it was for the producers to crank out a coherent movie due to all the script, logistical, budget, and legal issues that dogged the film every step of the way.   But most of all, I really wanted to understand how the AWFUL musical score got added to this film. It was really a by-product of the low-budget and chaotic schedule to get the film completed that such a counterproductive score was added. Irvin Kirschner did not approve of the score that Michel Legrand produced because it failed to convey the proper on-screen emotion, but it was too late in the production cycle and there was no money available to commission a new score. It was interesting to note that Legrand has more history and comfort writing songs than a theatrical score, and it showed clearly in this film. It was a huge editing challenge to mix and move the music that they had to scenes of the movie.     To my surprise and disappointment, the director and some other crew members had wanted Howard Shore to create the music, but some unnamed other producers were against it for reasons unexplained (probably money). If only a more mainstream composer had created the score, it would have lifted Never Say Never Again to a whole new level. The irritating music is a constant negative throughout the movie and undermines scene after scene. The opening title sequence is marred by the terrible title track, and the main NSNA theme is so melancholy and of such poor sound quality that it gives the whole movie a B-movie feel.     Another fact revealed in the commentary is how ruthlessly theBroccolis fought this movie in court. They literally dragged Jack Schwartzmann into court almost daily during production of NSNA to dispute script changes that the Broccolis claimed were outside the scope of the allowable screenplay. Somehow, the Broccolis were getting information about all the script changes as they happened to fuel their complaints in court.     I appreciate the candor that Kirschner relates in the commentary about the musical score issues, and some other production problems, that explain some of the forces that kept NSNA from being a truly great film. At least I feel better knowing they tried to make the best film they could, and indeed, made a better film than they had any right to considering the constant budget and legal issues that dogged the film.     With the exception of Kim Basinger, who looks great in this film, the actors did a superb job in this movie. I think this was Sean's best performance as Bond besides From Russia with Love. And as others have noted, he looked much more fit in this film than in Diamonds are Forever 12 years before. He deserves a lot of credit for returning to Bond and delivering a performance with the right balance of strength, wit, and acknowledgement of age.     Oh, and don't miss Rowan Atkinson as Bond's contact in Nassau. Mr. Bean was never so funny.
0307269752|4.0|Two very different problems are neatly blended in this well-written thriller, with a female protagonist who is both flawed and yet fascinating.  The author has created an intriguing character in Lisabeth Salander, who is antisocial and yet brilliant, wounded but capable of rising to acts of courage, bravery and sacrifice.  The two problems, one exposing corporate corruption on a grand scale, the other tracking the mystery of a girl who disappeared forty years in the past, are combined as an unfairly disgraced journalist teams up with the dauntless investigator Lizabeth Salander to tackle both issues.  The story moves at a good pace, never a dull moment, and the climax is very satisfying.  It is sad that the author of this excellent story died several years ago, and the translation of his work from Swedish is only now available. A debt of gratitude goes to the deceased writer, who saw to it that two more books featuring Lisabeth Salander were submitted before his untimely death.  I look forward to reading both of them when they are released.
B0000AOV85|5.0|I like to listen this album everyday, but knowing how they did to record it is amazing.
B001P5Q6FC|5.0|Three years ago, a friend gave me a copy of Ashes Of The Wake and I was hooked utterly. That said, I bought this album wondering if the evolution that had been prevalent in Sacrament would continue further down the spiral, losing me as a fan.<br /><br />No worries, as it turns out. This is not just my favorite Lamb of God album, it's one of my favorite metal albums of all time now.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, this is raw compared to Sacrament. Production levels that saturated the last album are nowhere to be found here - just blistering metal that will knock your molars out and make you scream for your mammy.<br /><br />These boys kick it off with a really gorgeous instrumental, but they don't overdo it. The first track, The Passing, is very brief and seques into Blythe screaming his f***ing lungs out on the next song.<br /><br />The drums are blistering as hell. Heavy, fast, sometimes even dipping down into the Thrash bucket. The songs are decadent in guitar work, offering fat melodies that will rip your scalp off. Blythe ventures into melodic screaming every so often, but mostly delivers the Pissed-Off-Demon-Lion roar that LoG fans love.<br /><br />The highlight of the album is a track called Broken Hands. If you have ever rocked out to metal, ever, this song will set you right the f*** off. It's a nuclear blast of rage and energy.<br /><br />All in all - buy this album if you like it brutal.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I cannot say anything but \\"AWESOME\\". These young men and their voices blew me away. A fan forever!
B000WIN7O6|5.0|Say what you will about the hype, what is important is the music and I can recommend it based on that alone.  From the fast moving \\"Not gonna get us\\" to the slightly slower \\"Show me love\\" something for everyone.  Standouts are the emotional and moving \\"30 Minutes\\", \\"Clowns(Can you see me now?)\\", and \\"Stars\\".  Also included are two songs in Russian for a nice change.  The whole feeling is very bittersweet with the songs revolving around the facets of love.
B0026GBIB6|1.0|I have been a fan of DM since the very beginning. I love nearly every song they have ever made...up until the last two albums. I am sorry, but it is just weak and boring now. Moving on now )-:
B001IBIQU6|5.0|This album is in no way a pop-commercial product but then again, isn't Depeche Mode an alternative, experimental and creative band? I think SOTU is the best CD the band has created since the departure of Alan Wilder! Sorry to those who find the 12th album a disappointment but maybe you should go listen to a CD put out by one of the American Idol winners. I admit, the first time I heard it, I didn't know if I like it or not. But now, I love it. It's not my favorite DM album but it is a good album. The Depeche Mode sound has never been exactly the same from album to album - Speak and Spell sounds nothing like Black Celebration, Some Great Reward sounds nothing like Songs of Faith and Devotion - and Sounds of the Universe is no exception. My advise is to sit back after having a glass or two of wine, put on the headphones and let the canvas of sound drift you away to an altered state of mind!
B0026GBIB6|5.0|I've been a DM fan since '83 and although I must say that I still miss their 80s and early 90s sound, I am nevertheless pleased with this current release. To top it all off, Amazon has the digital album for only [...]?! For a moment I thought it was all a mistake. If you're a devout Depeche Mode fan, you owe it to yourself to spend [...] on this album. C'mon!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I really have enjoyed this video. I am not very fit at all so level one (there are three total) kicks my butt! I honestly have a struggle just to make it through the entire 20 min workout. But it is a good struggle. I feel refreshed after her workout, though tired as anything. If you are serious about wanting to get into shape than this is a GREAT video to try. Each level is 20 minutes in length and gives you a great workout. She incorperates arms, legs, abs, strength, and cardio in each level to give a total body workout. She also keeps you motivated and with each move only being done for about 30 seconds it keeps you from getting tired of doing the same move for too long. I have only done this video about 4-5 times and I am already seeing a big difference in my endurance.

B001N26GFM|5.0|I saw this with my two older children, boy-13 girl-11. Before we saw it, they had many questions which I sought ot answer by going online. We found a site about Aushwitz, the camp in which the events of the movie take place. This was thier first exposure to the Holocaust. Having given them some of the horrific background surrounding those in the movie enabled them to understand better what was going on.<br /><br />It was a great movie and my kids agreed. They watched it a second time. The thing I liked about the movie was the fact that the film used the Holocaust as a backdrop, not as some politcal statement. It was there, just not in your face.<br /><br />The story was captivating, the ending completely unexpected. The three of us who watched it had a completely different ending envisioned. But I think as it unfolded, it made the movie much more powerful.<br /><br />Excellent, and I think kids could watch this without too much after affects. But an adult who understands what is going on needs to be present in order to explain what is going on.
B00006CXSS|5.0|It's a combination of documentary and movie.  The interviews with the men of Easy Company really make it come alive.  Otherwise you get caught up in the action and the story and it starts to feel like fiction.  Those men talking about their experiences and how they felt and how afraid they were, it makes it real again.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|I've never been a great fan of Depeche Mode. I have the greatest hits from the early years, dedicated to the pop hits and the turn towards industrial, and then I purchased the later day singles (enjoy the silence, behind the wheel, it's no good, etc). But I found that every time I listened to a full album, I was always skipping tracks and going straight to the hits. When DM reemerged on the music scene with Exciter, I was dissappointed to find that the group had done an \\"adult\\" album. A bit on the easy listening/starbucks side. But then they released Playing the Angels. It only had one true \\"hit\\", but the album itself was darker and heavier (more in tune with what I liked about DM), and I found myself actually listening to the whole thing.  Now, with Sounds of the Universe, Depeche Mode has made an album that I love from beginning to end. The songs are dense, atmospheric, and made to compliment eachother. With exception to the single, Wrong (which was stuck in my head since I first heard it about 2-3 weeks ago), the album boasts no \\"hits.\\" At least, not in the pop tradition. I could nominate several songs to be singles (Peace, Hole to Feed, Fragile Tension, In Sympathy), but I doubt any would reach the top ten. The songs still throb, and pulse (they ARE Depeche Mode), but I'm not sure if you could dance to it.  I've read the reviews since yesterday's release, and I've noticed that the people who don't like it are either stuck with the notion that DM stopped being good after Walking in my Shoes, or only just became a fan after Exciter. Keep in mind that I'm not a die-hard fan, I don't like everything that DM has released. But this album, to me, is one of their best.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have been a Depeche Mode fan since Some Great Reward.  Back when Mtv played Music Videos and People are People found it's way to America.  I am a fan, and have purchased everything they have put out before and after!  They are my favorite band, and thus I am a bit biased.  That said, I will offer my two cents.    Sounds of the Universe 2009    In Chains:  This song starts with an introduction that to some may be a bit annoying, but is a build up to the first track on the new album.  This is a slow moving brooding sexy ensemble and eases you into the album nicely.  Very Classic sounding DM!    Hole to Feed:  David Gahan's first songwriting effort on this album.  It is aggressive, and addictive.  Nice STOMP moving swiftly about.  This is a bit more ROCKY than some may like, but I love it!  I really like the guitar part in the middle around the 1:28 mark.    Wrong:  Most of you know this one already.  For a real treat, get ahold of the Trentmoeller Remix!  I am not normally into remixes, but this one is killer!  Great track.    Fragile Tension:  A little softer than the first 3.  This song has a good tempo, and nice arrangement with a little dirty guitar put in the mix.    Little Soul:  The album slows down on this track.  Not sure what to think of this track as of yet.  My Little Soul will leave a footprint.    In Sympathy:  Tempo is back again.  Dave's voice is really good here.  Lyrics are really clever, and I love the harmonies on the chorus.    Peace:  This one is starting to grow on me.  This is ANALOG BLISS with hymn like harmonies.  The song's arrangement is a little off to me, but the sounds in this one bring the atmosphere that have not been on many tracks over the last few albums.  Most people either love it or hate it.    Come Back:  Another Gahan effort here, it took a little time for me, but after seeing the Studio Session version of this, it has become a favorite!    Spacewalker:  This is Martin Gore playing around with a lot of old toys that he bought off ebay.  It is an instrumental that sounds like it could have come straight out of a sci-fi movie.    Perfect:  An excellent track and I must say has Dave sounding a wee bit like Simon LeBon.  Starts off a little like Suburbia from PSB, but this is a GREAT GROOVE.  I hope this is a single, as it is possibly the most commercial song that I have ever heard from DM!    Miles Away:  A very BLUESY Rock Stomp that is a lot of fun.  Very much like I feel you or Personal Jesus.  Very strong track.    Jezebel:  Oh Martin.  We love you, but this one is very similar to Damaged People from PTA only it isn't as good.  In fact, it reminds me of a track from the movie GREASE (Hopelessly devoted to you), but this just kind of plods along.  Martin has a great voice, but we need another Somebody, Sometimes, or A Question of Lust.      Corrupt:  This is what DM is all about.  Classic track with some very dark lyrics.  This may be my very favorite song on the album.  At the end, there is a very special treat.  Let it play, do not switch to the next track!    All in all, a very solid effort by the Boys from Basildon.  29 years after the release of Speak and Spell, they are proving all there critics WRONG!  Keep it up fellas!
1563890119|4.0|Even Neil Gaiman proclaims that this is his clumsiest and least favorite of all of the sandman titles. In that case this has to be the greatest series of all time because i thought the first volume was amazing. What lost it a star was it was a bit anti-climactic in places and the showdown with doctor destiny didn't  live up to my expectations. But this book will forever change how you sleep. Some find this book a little weird and rightfully so. But aren't our dreams trippy and crazy? This book is like nothing else I have ever read or experienced. I recommend it to everyone who is ready for a huge departure from your everyday superhero comic.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I love this movie. While I could continue just to watch it online for free, I chose to pay for this to view the special features. They did not disappoint. Brand new songs for the musical commentary, behind the scenes information, and plenty of hints of a continuation. Overall, definitely worth the money to purchase this DVD.
1416550542|5.0|Okay so far Kate Morton is 2 for 2.  I LOVED this book- even better than \\"The House at Riverton\\" I think.  I will say that I guessed the big twist/mystery halfway into the book, but I still enjoyed the way the story unfolded.  I did find it a little confusing the way each chapter would switch between time and character, but after a little while I was totally absorbed in the story.
B000001Y42|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I'm one of those who disses limp bizkit all the time and then goes to listen to death metal and other heavy genres. BUT!... after listening to this... I just gotta say that it's actually a cool heavy album and is nothing like the later commercial stuff they put out. Less of a hip hop influence ('ugh') and more of a rap metal thing if you know what i mean. I hate durst but musically the band is not bad unlike the other three cord kids but i am NOT a limp bizkit fan I just got a kick out of this cd even though they are the most hated band in the \\"fake metal\\" game. Unlike Rollin, this is raw has some great heaviness and actually great screams from fred (man am i gonna get dissed) but i don't care because this is not bad of course i hate the rap which is what they are known for but the other stuff is good. Not an essential album but think twice cuz songs like Stuck are great for the pit. Wes borland is a great guitarist no matter what. He shows pure aggression that tears everyone who hates bizkit even though the songs are easy lo learn.
B00000739N|5.0|These songs are harrowing but beautiful and ultimately rewarding if you can survive the album's labyrinthine descent into misery and despair. The most melodic songs include Caroline Says I and II, the wistful Oh Jim, the painful The Kids, the bleak The Bed and Sad Song which is soulful in its melancholia.<br /><br />Over these beautiful melodies Reed lays his vocals that are so authentic, apt and gripping that listening to them is like seeing snippets of a movie. Of course, they form a complete picture to create one of the most cohesive and searing concept albums in rock.<br /><br />From the jazzy intro of Berlin with its lounge piano & brief strains of Happy Birthday through [[ASIN:0140067620 Lady Day]] with its spoken & sung segments, right to the melancholy last refrains of Sad Song, the album holds one's ears & attention. Berlin is unique in Reed's body of work although tracks like Oh Jim & How Do You Think It Feels would have fitted well on [[ASIN:B0002PZMSS Transformer]].<br /><br />The sensitive production & sympathetic arrangements add gravitas to the somber mood to create a dark masterpiece of epic proportions. It's not really a rock album & therefore somewhat inaccessible to some fans. Berlin has in my opinion improved with time and remains one of Lou Reed's most singular achievements.
0152023984|5.0|Why is this called a Children's Book?  I just gave it to one of my grandchildren on their 12th birthday.  Some computer program may tally up the vocabulary, the grammar, the sentence length and say it is 9-12 year old reading level, but that IS NOT COMPREHENSION LEVEL! ! !    I had to think long and hard to decide this grandchild is mature enough to deal with this book now.  I know many adults for whom it all just slides off and leaves them with only the question \\"what's the big deal about this book?\\"
B000I2MRHE|3.0|this is a really nice looking product but my son isn't enjoying it as much as i would have hoped... he still doesn't like tummy time. it is getting better though and he does spin around easily and does enjoy (for a few minutes anyhow) the toys on the mat. just a warning - when we first used it, i guess he wasn't positioned on the ladybuy properly, and he slid off head first onto the mat. he didn't cry or get hurt, but just a warning!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I found this program on cox cable and was excited.  I have been on yo-yo diets and thought this is it, I have got to get this right.  I did this workout for 5 days straight and on the fifth day I was able to make it through the entire program, okay I made it to 25 min and then thought I was going to collapse.  My thighs hurt so much that I could barely walk down the stairs (hahahaha).  It was all worth it.  I decided that I had to have this video because it is only on cable for a limited time and then a new program starts.  I am glad that I was able to get it this.  You will not be disappointed.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|As a longime Diana Krall's fan I am extremely disappointed with the recent effort. She has become so predictably boring: sweet,sleepy sounds, strings--music that is just not jazz and obviously not what Mrs. Krall can do. Her music now is a cup of coffee with a pound of sugar in it. Kenny G anyone?  I have seen Diana Krall Live twice with the Quartet. She is an excellent JAZZ piano player and a great singer. I still consider \\"Stepping Out\\" one of her best efforts. Nat King Cole dedication album was great as well as \\"Love Scenes\\" and \\"Only trust your heart\\" are also great.  What drives Diana to make all of those string infused albums in past few years (except \\"Girl in the other room\\") is beyond me. I will not consider getting her next album before I find out what it is.   Meanwhile, I will turn my attention to real jazz singers of today: Patricia Barber, Lavay Smith, Madeleine Peyroux. Has anyone heart of Hope Waits ? Not necessarily a true jazz cd but what a fresh voice. Melody Gardot is another one to pay attention to. And if there aren't any modern female jazz divas to listen to, there is always time for Dinah, Sarah, Billie and Ella. Anita O'Day and Chris Connor are also a good jazz therapy.  I hope to hear some good music from really talented Diana Krall in the future.
0307269981|3.0|This is the second book in the Millenium series created by Stieg Larsson. The plot revolves around the human and sex trafficing industry in Sweden and the murder of three individuals with connections to the Lisbeth Salander character.<br /><br />I found this to be a pleasing (yet inferior) sequel to \\"Dragon\\". While one does not need to read Dragon, I would recommend it.  For my money it (Dragon) is the superior read.<br /><br />The Lisbeth Salander character is a very interesting protagonist. When Lisbeth is being written about in The Girl Who Played with Fire, the story seems to move - when she is not, the story drags.<br /><br />The Mikael Blomqvist, Erica Berger etc. characters and how Steig Larsson created and developed the characters seemed deeper, fresher and have more substance in the first novel. I thought the first book had a better focus, pace, fewer hanging threads, was more intricately plotted and had a better overall story.<br /><br />With that said, the sequel is a good, not exceptional, read. My recommendation is to read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo first, then this novel to fully appreciate the world that Steig Larsson created.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|For what it was meant for.  Most other Judas Priest albums have been alright, at best, or down right horrible at worst.      Nostradamus is Epic and Powerful and Melodic and well, just plain Great!  It has a couple of clunkers, most notably Lost Love, but overall it will keep you enthralled.  If you are a huge fan of Painkiller's over the top thrash metal on steroids sound, you will hate this, but then again, you deserve to. This is more of an art form than a cry for help, as was Painkiller.  Yeah go ahead and laugh you Leather Rebels!    Judas Priest finally got it right. They will be hard pressed to match this powerful masterpiece.  If this is the first time you are hearing Judas Priest, and you like this alot like I did, unfortunately the only album even close to this is 'Sad Wings of Destiny' and it is 33 years old.    Enjoy this for what it is, a one time master piece.
0525478183|4.0|In the course of three novels geared toward young adults it has become clear that there are certain things one should always expect in a John Green novel.  First, that it will feature at least two lovable losers front and center - intelligent, hyper-articulate guys who just can't seem to get it (or keep it) together.  One of the things complicating their lives is inevitably female trouble, usually in the form of a troubled girl whose indomitable spirit and rebellious antics have the power to save and destroy them.  Undoubtedly, she's got a screw loose (not to mention a wildly self destructive bent) but her power to captivate and seduce keeps them in her thrall.  And finally, one should always expect a wicked sense of humor; I'm not one to laugh out loud at books all that often, and Green gets me more than once in each of his books, particularly this latest novel, \\"Paper Towns\\" (there's nothing so subversively naughty as the sexual encounter in [[ASIN:014241221X Looking for Alaska]], but there is the typical abundance of one-liners, such as one character getting described as having \\"hit puberty but never hit it very hard.\\").<br /><br />Fans of Green's novels may be disappointed in \\"Paper Towns\\" because of its striking similarities to \\"Looking for Alaska,\\" and they would be right to be unnerved by the same-sameness.  Margo Roth Spiegelman, the indomitable female presence here, is essentially Alaska 2.0 (Margo's self destructiveness coming out in a desperate need to run away instead of Alaska's alcoholism being the key separation).  There are also similarities to [[ASIN:0142410705 An Abundance of Katherines]] - one of the lovable losers, for example, rather suddenly (and totally inexplicably) lands a hot girlfriend.<br /><br />It would be all too easy to worry that Green may have written himself into a box that he may never escape, but the fact of the matter is that \\"Paper Towns\\" is still quite an enjoyable ride - and while it may be very similar to \\"Looking For Alaska,\\" I for one actually think this novel smooths out some of the kinks that annoyed me about that previous novel.  I won't worry until I see what Green does next.  Because I will definitely be looking forward to it.<br /><br />Grade: B+<br /><br />PS: Do check this novel out, and be sure to pick up both of Green's prior novels (linked in the review above) as well.  You'll thank yourself later.ually think this novel smooths out some of the kinks that annoyed me about that previous novel.  I won't worry until I see what Green does next.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|The look of the board and cards has changed since I first played it, but it's still the same classic game.  My five year old is starting to play it (with a little help, of course) and really enjoys it.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|\\"The Reader\\" is an English-language film based on a German-language book, \\"Der Vorleser\\" by Bernhard Schlink, a novel in which the author explores questions of guilt and responsibility for the Holocaust in his parents' generation. He does so through the experiences of Michael Berg (David Kross), who, as a teenager in 1958, had an affair with a woman 20 years his senior, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet). Years later, when he is at law school, Michael finds that Hanna is a defendant in a war crimes case. She is charged with the murders of hundreds of prisoners who died in a burning building when she was a guard at a concentration camp. Decades later, when Michael (Ralphes Fiennes) is middle-aged, he still has trouble assessing how much guilt to assign Hanna and by this time is carrying around some guilt of his own.<br /><br />It's probably impossible to write any opinion or lack of opinion about the events of World War II in Germany without stirring controversy. But, in the rest of the world, people interpret these stories as morality plays that can be applied to a broader context. \\"The Reader\\" was a bestseller in the United States. The movie has a great cast and an interesting story, but it may owe its critical success to the fact that it lends itself to being interpreted differently by different people. The question of whether people should be condemned for doing what most people would do under the circumstances, that was acceptable behavior at the time, remains a sticky issue in Germany. \\"The Reader\\" views the trial of a group of SS guards whose commitment to duty resulted in hundreds of deaths through the eyes of the younger generation, which is deeply ashamed of the nation's past.<br /><br />The DVD (Weinstein 2009): There are 5 featurettes, 11 deleted and extended scenes, and a theatrical trailer. \\"Adapting a Timeless Masterpiece\\" (25 min) interviews director Stephen Daldry, screenwriter David Hare, and author Bernhard Schlink about the adaptation, themes, and the cast about the director's style. \\"A Conversation with David Kross & Stephen Daldry\\" (10 min) includes a few press interviews with the actor and director. \\"Kate Winslet on the Art of Aging Hanna Schmitz\\" (13 min) spends time in the make-up chair with Winslet and the make-up team as they age her 30 years.

My distant Cousin George at San Juan Hill. My 5th Great Grandfather Robert in the Revolutionary War. I would imagine dying a hero meant nothing when I'm sure he would have been much happier at home.<br /><br />I often wonder if they all understood the price of freedom. That sometimes pivotal events take place, and we can act. Or, we can stand on the sidelines.<br /><br />What if everyone wanted to stand on the sidelines? What would it really mean to our freedom?<br /><br />I wonder if the Spartans knew what their sacrifice would really mean almost 3,000 years later?<br /><br />Every once in awhile a historical event occurs that has the power to change the future forever. Such is the Battle at Thermopylae.<br /><br />In 480 BC, the Medes-Persian emperor Xerxes planned an invasion of the countries that now form the modern day Greece. He needed \\"earth and water\\" to continue his campaigns, and the Greeks stood in the way.<br /><br />Specifically, the Spartans. Sparta, like all the Greek nations of the time, was democratic and autonomous. They had no intention of relinquishing that autonomy to a tyrant like Xerxes.<br /><br />King Leonidas, one of the two hereditary kings of Sparta, decided the Spartans had to take a stand. Although he couldn't take the full Spartan Army with him because of a festival taking place in Sparta, he chose to take action anyway.<br /><br />He chose 300 \\"Sires\\" for his unit. Sires were men who had sons to carry on the family name, as well as assume responsibility for the families left behind.<br /><br />The king and his small army met Xerxes and his million at Thermopylae, a narrow pass that led to Central Greece.<br /><br />By taking a stand at the pass, Leonidas coul negate Xerxes's millions and hold off Xerxes's army indefinitely.<br /><br />The fighting was brutal. Xerxes's army suffered heavy losses, even when he sent in his elite troops, the Immortals.<br /><br />The Spartans were defeated on the third day when they were betrayed by a man from one of the local villages. He led the Persians through a goat path and around the Spartans.<br /><br />And so the Spartans lost, and they all died.<br /><br />But that's not the end of the story. On the surface, they did lose. They were wiped out. Xerxes's army got past them.<br /><br />Because of the sacrifice of the Spartans, it led to what happened next. And what happened next changed the course of history. Not only did it lead to Greek victory, but it preserved democracy.<br /><br />The Greeks rallied. One year later, they defeated Xerxes. He never recovered. 150 years later, Alexander the Great would defeat the entire Persian empire and become the dominant force in the world. Greek culture would spread over the known world, and any influence of the Medes-Persian empire would be reduced to ashes.<br /><br />Over 2,000 years later, democratic principles are still the dominant force in the world. The East has never successfully invaded the West.<br /><br />That's the history, and the backdrop for the movie.

1439136653|5.0|I read this book prior to watching the film and was very dissapointed in the movie.  The book was a page turner.  I could not put it down and finished it in four days.  There were several beautiful scenes in the book that brought me to tears.  I was looking forward to how the scenes would play out in the movie and was surprised to see the book characters not even included in the movie.  I would highly recommend this book if you are looking for a great story you cannot put down.  Keep in mind it is a completely different story than the movie, but in my opinion much better.

B001IBIQU6|5.0|What a very great and a strong album. It will be one of the masterpiece among Violator, Songs of Faith & Devotion and Black Celebration in the next few years. If you like Violator then this album will grow on you slowly and would be Violator 2. Here is my theory.     Miles Away / The Truth is = World In My Eyes   Jezebel = The Sweetest Perfection   Wrong = Personal Jesus   Fragile Tension = Halo   Little Soul = Waiting For The Night   Perfect = Enjoy The Silence   In Sympathy = Policy of Truth   Come Back = Blue Dress   Corrupt = Clean     Plus many great songs like In Chains,Peace,Light,Ghosts (the latter two are bonus tracks for the box set that you shouldn't miss at all!)
B001RTP48Q|4.0|Thou not as club friendly as the last 2 releases.....a solid release! Hope some remixes will follow. Just hope some NRG trax remixes will be following. Not the same lame tired hip hop/down beat! My fav. is the CD II track 1 (etc.) which features Philip Oakey and the dub of \\"All Over The World\\". Nice and makes me want more!
B000UD08HW|3.0|Low quality picture and sound.  Thought Gilmore would do better.  Yes at Montrose is the one to get.
B00005V1WO|5.0|This movie is one I could wtch over and over - it inspired me to read the original [[ASIN:0141439475 Frankenstein (Penguin Classics)]] (I had never read it until after I saw this  movie), I will warn those who do not want to see nudity that there is some in this film but it is not gratuitous and does have a bearing on the story or character development. All the people mentioned in this film are real historical figures and alot of what is said about there lives outside of the main story line are actually true (no one knows if the events shown in the film took place - but I like to think that it did)
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|I'm a fan of Hayden Christensen mainly from Star Wars and Life as a House, so I'm probably not completely unbiased, but I liked this movie. I thought it was entertaining and kind of cool to see what someone would do with this power. Some of the storyline is flimsy, like his quick falling-in-love with the heroine for no real reason, but Hayden does a nice job in the movie, as does Jamie Bell. Lots of great scenery (locations) and fight scenes, cool special effects. Definitely worth viewing, I've watched it several times and still like it.
0671015206|3.0|I'm surprised this book has such a good rating. Yes, it is informative and smashes the misconceptions people have about millionaires and how they spend their money. But it is also very repetitive, full of boring charts and statistics and overall a very dry read. I'm having to force myself to get through it.
B0012QCZ54|4.0|The \\"story\\" is a little weak and has been done a million times in other movies, but the dancing in this is fantastic, and Robert Hoffman is EXTREMELY charming. Adam Sevani (Moose) is a great surprise. The final dance scene is well worth watching the movie for, unique and immensely entertaining. It's not going to win Oscars but you will be entertained and probably want to watch it again just for the amazing dancing.
159102594X|4.0|It's always scary to start a new series of books.  I'm often afraid that I'll dislike the first, and then be mad that I don't want to finish the series so I know the end.    I don't have that problem here.  Although the basic elements of the story (setting, purpose of characters) are not very original, the way that they are conveyed, and brought to life in this book, are.  The characters all have their own individuality and problems, and the plights they have to deal with all seem very real.         The biggest problem I have with books of this sort, is that there are often times too many characters to follow, and things get confusing.  The author has done a nice job of separating everyone, and started to bring them so that their paths intertwine.  Overall I'm very happy with this book.  I have about 75 pages left, and have already ordered part 2.  I highly reccomend this book.
B000QXTF48|5.0|When I first published this review on Christmas night of 2006, I'd been thinking about Christmas of 1968-- I was 14 then. That was an awful year to live through for anyone, especially a kid. The Vietnam War, the assassination of public figures, and seeing part of my city burn the previous summer during riots-- it was a lot to handle.<br /><br />The song \\"Save The Life Of My Child\\" from BOOKENDS was in my head all throughout 1968. I identified with that frightened boy standing on the ledge, while a crowd below urged him to jump. His final thought as \\"he flew away\\" was \\"...I got no hiding place.\\" That was exactly how I felt in those days.<br /><br />What a powerful and unforgettable way to begin an album. The moods of BOOKENDS reflect so well the troubled times of the late '60s, with its anti-war sentiments (Punky's Dilemma), and its tales of love and love lost (America, Overs). The original first side of the record ends with the sad longing and fears of Old Friends, who sit on a park bench and reminisce together. But this bittersweet song has a deeper message. These old men were survivors-- if they were supposed to be elderly in 1968, then they made it through the Depression, and two world wars, and if they were the youth of 1968 projected into the future, well they too made it through trials by fire.<br /><br />And so have I made it through! I'm in my 50s now and headed for that park bench one day. The fears and sadness of 1968 are long past, but a final memory remains:<br /><br />As I lay in bed early that Christmas Eve, the colored glow of tree lights seeps into my room. Off in the distance are disembodied television voices of Apollo astronauts circling the moon-- they quote passages from the book of Genesis, and wish well the \\"people of the good Earth.\\" It's a peaceful and hopeful ending to a terrible year.<br /><br />Very few albums truly encapsulate a moment in time. Even fewer connect deeply with listeners in ways they may not realize until decades into the future. Simon & Garfunkel's BOOKENDS is one of those rare examples. It is paradoxically timeless and a reflection of its time.<br /><br />\\"Bookends\\" is available on [[ASIN:B0000024TQ CD]].

0312380852|5.0|I first encountered Annika through her blog \\"Annika's Atelier\\" right after I started my own blog on micro macrame. She makes all kinds of beautiful things (not just micro macrame). We corresponded a bit back and forth over the next couple of years, checking into each other's blogs upon occasion. I found her to be a delightful and talented woman.<br /><br />Recently, she contacted me to review her new book. I accepted right away and she sent me an advance copy.<br /><br />At first glance, I fell in love. What a lovely book with 30 projects in varying degrees of difficulty and a wide variety of projects - from bracelets to ornaments, from victorian to deco - Something for everyone!<br /><br />Then, this past weekend, I had a chance to delve deeper. You know, try one of the projects to see how the instructions worked out. (And, yes, I could not wait to make one of her designs for my own personal use!)<br /><br />I made the \\"Stained Glass Bracelet\\" without too much trouble.<br /><br />I had one question which she answered right away and said that anyone buying her book could contact her through her website[...] or her blog [...] and she would be happy to answer any questions.<br /><br />I really cannot say enough about this book. It has beautiful photos, is well written and would provide anyone (beginner or expert) with plenty of projects and inspiration for quite some time...and isn't that really what it is all about?
B001GQACGE|5.0|This is definately Beyonce's time to shine.  She managed to grow from a lead singer from R&B group Destiny's Child to a successful solo star.  I have listened to all three of her albums so far and her latest \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce\\" is her best!  It is divided into 2 discs.  The first one being called \\"I Am...\\" and the second album being called \\"Sasha Fierce.\\"  Disc one shows the soft side of the performer Beyonce with slow R&B jams.  The second disc shows off Beyonce's alter-ego known as \\"Sasha Fierce.\\"  While both discs are good, my favorites are on the first disc with just Beyonce.  This album is a really good listen when you play both seperately.  It has a variety of styles from pop to hip-hop to R&B.  This is definately the best R&B album released in 2008.  I didn't care for her last album \\"B Day\\" but her latest album is pretty good!  Out of all the R&B albums released in 2008, \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce\\" is probably the best!
B001TOD92C|5.0|Somewhere late in the Wrestler after many stunningly painful and true human moments,  Mickey Rourke the movie star takes over, we can see the young actor in those eyes again as tries one last time to woo Marisa Tomei and salvage some kind of a life.  What starts off as a quasi doc threatens to turn into full on Hollywood near the finale but the acting and directing are so sure fire that the course the script takes is overwhelmed by the talent onscreen and off.  It is great to see Mickey Rourke in a vehicle worthy of his talent again, I was reminded of another lost classic HOMEBOY, which is unsettling in the way it mirrors his offscreen boxing career.  Brilliant acting and directorial decisions make this the most real and underrated film of 2008, despite the accolades.
B0026GBIB6|2.0|I've been a DM fan since around 1988 & it seems like with each album they release their \\"spark\\" is just fading.  I think the last DM album I was totally into was \\"Violator\\", however I felt that \\"Playing the angel\\" was a pretty good DM album too.  These songs are very mellow & kind of flat for me.  I must say I've only listened to the album one time completely on release day but it's just not keeping my attention.  If your looking for a real up tempo album based off the single \\"Wrong\\" you will be pretty disappointed, that track is pretty much the most up tempo rocking song on the whole album.  Martin & Dave however still sound fantastic, it's just the music & lyrics are not their.
074322454X|5.0|Despite watching the series over and over again on the History channel, the book is still well worth the read.
B001FBSMF8|2.0|This music is not unlistenable. But it is not what I want from Chris Cornell. Maybe if I can just erase from my mind everything I now about him as a performer I can reset and get a fresh new perspective. I would guess that's what he wants us to do. But the change is to abrupt. I think I could've handled a few songs on an album featuring Timbaland, a mix of old and new. The other problem is that this is not original material. We already have enough radio-friendly creatively stale crap piercing the airwaves. It's a novalty act, the rocker and the hip-hop artist join forces, only Aerosmith and RUN-DMC did it better.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Made on a shoestring budget by the visionary director of [[ASIN:B00005Q4CS Requiem for a Dream (Director's Cut)]] and [[ASIN:B00005JPAR The Fountain (Widescreen Edition)]], The Wrestler marked the much publicized comeback of Mickey Rourke. Truth is that Rourke has appeared in many films over the last few years sporadically. This is a \\"comeback\\" in a much grander sense. This is an acclaimed actor giving the performance of his life, a performance that makes you want to cheer while never resorting to the obvious inspirational clichés. The Wrestler is one of the top five best films of 2008. It's not grand, technical filmmaking but it was one of the most profound movie-going experiences I've had. It's entertaining and powerfully moving, coupled with incredible performances, a raw script, and a perfect directorial style.    Rourke plays Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, once a famous professional wrestler now reduced to playing small, local gigs to a small, nostalgic crowd. Randy lives in a trailer, struggling to make the rent balancing wrestling with a part time job at a supermarket. With no friends, Randy finds solace and human contact with a stripper (Marisa Tomei), whose job isn't unlike his. While trying to reconnect with his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood), Randy sees one final shot at the top in a re-match with the Ayatollah.    It's worth noting that you don't have to like wrestling to love this film, although it does clear up some of the misconceptions about the sport. Wrestling is \\"fake,\\" in the sense that it's staged...But when you're getting hit with a chair or slammed to the ground, it's real. The film does a very good job of explore the thin line between \\"real\\" and \\"fake.\\"    What The Wrestler is really about is a performer who has no roots in the real world. He lives and breathes to be this character, it's all he knows. Only with a roaring crowd does he feel at home. This film is much deeper than its subject matter and title imply.    There's so much raw, real human emotion here. It could've easily strayed into familiar or predictable territory, but Robert Siegel's script does not allow it. This is not an inspirational film about a down-on-his-luck wrestler, on the verge of a comeback who falls in love with the stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold. The film takes a bleak look at these characters and shows them as people. They're flawed, they make mistakes, not everything turns out all right in the end. All of this is handled masterfully by director Darren Aronofsky; strange, since this is his most simplistic film in terms of filmmaking style. The musical score by Clint Mansell isn't mentioned much in reference to this film, but it's really terrific. It's subtle and underscores every scene perfectly, adding to that bleak simplicity.    As for acting, Wood doesn't seem far removed from her [[ASIN:B00013RC2K Thirteen]] character as Randy's estranged daughter, but she does a good job with what she's given. Tomei got an Oscar-nomination for her role. She's certainly a brave actress, who looks stunning at 40. This is not an easy character to play, but Tomei brings believability to the role that many actresses would not have. It's a 3-dimensional character that could've easily been a 1-dimensional one.    Now, let's talk about Rourke. What a performance! There's no hiding the parallels between Rourke's real life and the character of Randy the Ram, but don't think this is just Rourke playing himself. I can't express the level of disappointment I felt when Sean Penn's name was read as the winner of the Best Actor Academy Award. Sean Penn is one of the finest actors of his generation and he did an astounding job bringing Harvey Milk to life. But Rourke more than physically becomes Randy the Ram, he brings such life, such pathos to his character that I have no doubt in my mind who gave the superior performance of 2008. It's certainly the most affecting and most powerful performance of that year.    There's a scene near the end where Randy is talking to the crowd and says \\"...I ain't as pretty as I used to be...As time goes by, they say `he's washed up. He's finished. He's a loser. He's all through.' But you know what? The only ones who are gonna tell me when I'm through doing my thing is you people here.\\" This is the emotional climax of the film. This isn't just Randy talking to the crowd, its Rourke talking to us; the people who still care about him. I'm glad to have him back. He's not through yet and even though the film has ended...I'm still cheering.    GRADE: A

B000VSBX34|4.0|I friend of mine loaned this to our family since my 14-year-old daughter (drummer in her own basement band) has really gotten into the Beatles in a big way lately.  We sat down and watched it together -- what a hoot!<br /><br />It's definitely slap-stick humor with a thin story line tying the music together, which doesn't sound very positive, but it's funny.  We are still referencing scenes in the movie to this day and we watched it about eight weeks ago. It was great to see the \\"younger\\" version of the group and how each one was so full of personality.<br /><br />If you are a Beatles fan and have never seen this, it's about time -- really, really fun to watch.

0743297334|5.0|The Sun Also Rises, published in 1926, is Hemingway's great first novel about the aftermath of World War I on a group of Americans living in Paris in the 1920's. It's view of life is bleak to the very end, almost to a fault; but it has a kind of sparse poetic grace in descriptive language that carries one through the pessimism on a wave of aesthetic bliss.<br /><br />The greatness is a product of this original narrative style executed to nearly perfect emotional and tonal effect. It is a new kind of stream of consciousness: not flashy, jazzy and allusive like Joyce, Woolf, or (three years later) Faulkner; but instead a steady chain of observations from the inner thoughts of someone who is sane, experienced, and who looks to report reality with a kind of shell-shocked, bunker objectivity; and whose emotions come through in the cynical realism one might expect from a survivor of an apocalypse. At times the spare descriptions created insufficient clarity, so that some sentences cannot be definitively intepreted and so the meaning is lost or diminished, but such sentences are rare.<br /><br />The emotion underneath the cynicism is subtle, and its impact is cumulative. It develops as one comes to trust Hemingway as a truth-teller. The narrator and main character tells a story of aimless and pleasure-less indulgence, in which war trauma (physical and psychological) is the felt but unspoken source and context of all the emptiness in the characters' actions.<br /><br />Jake Barnes is the owner of the consciousness being so artfully described. But Brett Ashley, the woman he loves and can't get away from, is the vortex of all the emotional action. She is a woman who loves Jake and is not deceptive to him, yet because he can't satisfy her she uses several other men for sex. She seems to have some vague variety of intermittent idealism and moral pride, so she occasionally struggles to manage the side-effects of her cold impulsiveness.<br /><br />Brett is a remarkable character in that clearly she is damaged like Jake (psychically if not physically), and yet she has a unique power that none of the men do, and in watching how she uses that power, one cannot decide to the very end of the story if she is more or less of a person than Jake, or if she has courage, or is worth much sympathy, or if her conscience is fully developed, or if she even has a conscience. That is, one wonders if her apparent moral pride and idealism are actually just grief for having lost any moral pride and idealism.<br /><br />Her deep, enigmatic complexity (and how it makes the reader react) is the greatest accomplishment in this story, but given her place as the emotional center of the story, the emptiness surrounding this elusive complexity also makes perhaps the most cynical statement in a book filled with such cynicism, about the powerlessness that emotionally damaged humans have over their own will. The book has a great last line which sums up all of this tough-minded despair.<br /><br />It may be a matter of opinion as to whether 'The Sun Also Rises' is a classic tragedy or just a well-executed exercise in morbid masochism. In any case, it is unforgettable.d like Jake (psychically if not physically), and yet she has a unique power that none of the men do, and in watching how she uses that power, one cannot decide to the very end of the story if she is more or less of a person than Jake, or if she has courage, or is worth much sympathy, or if her conscience is fully developed, or if she even has a conscience.

B001IBIQU6|5.0|I have a hard time seeing how anyone can give this album one star.  I admit that it took me a few listens to really get into this album, but after a bit the songs really grew on me.  This is a mature band making the music they want.  These guys don't have anything to prove to anyone and I think that's reflected in their writing.  All in all a very listenable album that you'll appreciate if you take the time to digest it a bit.<br /><br />I'm really digging: Peace, In Chains, Wrong, Come Back, & Perfect.  The only track I'm not really feeling is Miles away.
1591791707|5.0|Life-changing.  NVC is a wonderful approach!  Highly, HIGHLY recommended!    I grew up in an environment of critical, angry, blaming and disrespectful communication.  So, that's what I knew how to do when my needs were not being met:  blame others for not acting the 'right' way and 'making' me unhappy.  Doesn't give much leverage for changing the situation, does it?  I don't like treating people that way, they don't like it either, and those behaviors don't work very well for meeting my needs!  I felt helpless, frustrated, guilty and angry, and learned to mostly withdraw and suffer in silence.  Very unpleasant.    Marshall's NVC approach shows me how to take responsibility for my emotions and reactions.  When I'm unhappy, NVC tells me that my needs are not being met.  NVC shows how to consciously figure out what I need, to distinguish which needs are my responsibility vs. needs that are reasonable to ask other people to help with, and how to connect with people in a respectful, loving and gentle way to get my and their needs met in a way that everyone is happy with.      NVC also helps me handle people feeling angry at me:  I work with them to understand and communicate their needs in a gentle, respectful way.  Then I'm generally glad to help.  Very win-win.    I LOVE this approach!  THANK you, Marshall!    Also highly recommended:  Pema Chodron's \\"Don't Bite the Hook\\".
B00005JPMZ|5.0|If you're not a fan of Ninja Turtles, or new to the franchise, this movie won't likely convert you. Very little background is given; unless you already know the turtles and their personalities, you'll be lost.     If you're a fan who grew up with the original series, or even became introduced to them with the newer television series, you will enjoy this movie. It's not as good as the first two live action movies, but it's better than the third. It does an effective job of developing the turtles, though the villains are mostly without depth. A very character-driven movie, which is surprising from the Ninja Turtles.
0792839730|1.0|This movie has a star-studded cast that probably intrigues everyone to watch it, but a lot of the American cast seems to be playing spot cameo roles rather than being significant in contribution or in memorable acting jobs.  Redford isn't seen until the movie is half over and he's most standing around.  Ryan O'Neal as a commanding general is improbable and he sounds like he's reading 3rd grade text books. James Caan's role is bewildering altogether.  Gene Hackman follows suit with the others.  After the movie was made he even commented that the individual roles of all these stars was minimal because of the story.     While I realize there were lots of sub-stories to this operation, the constant jumping around from area to area only worsened the hoped for continuity of the film. Liv Ulman seems to have been thrown in so there's at least one female star.  Her lines would not fill a typewritten page.  And so it goes... this film is no Patton, Battle of the Bulge, or Platoon.  If you have 3 hours to kill on a rainy day, perhaps you should pick up the book and read the story.  It _might_ be more enlightening.  Being a vet, I enjoy a good military novel/movie, and I checked this one out from my local library out of curiosity.  Big disappointment.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|David foster is very talented. He brings on many others who proforme very nicely as well. Good entertainment I highly recomend it. Please go to YOU Tub and put MrWm2800 in the You Tub Search box and you will bring up this, as well as several other DVD concert reviews I have done. There is 2 or more pages of concert reviews in You Tub by me
0060566108|4.0|Built To Last was published more than ten years ago, and some of its examples of \\"enduring companies\\" may seem a bit out of place when you think about how the companies are doing today [Citibank being perhaps the worst example].  But the lessons are still potent, and maybe even help explain the fall form grace of companies like Citi, they lost touch with their core ideology and enduring values; they chased profits without real purpose, and it cost them their legacy.
B00005JL1C|5.0|If you like this movie, it is great. If you don't, I would not recommend buying it. Personally, I think it is a great movie and bought it for that reason.
B000W91RUG|5.0|When I was first introduced to this show on the CBS line up, I was very skeptical due mainly to the long title, and I pretty much turned my nose to it completely, but since it was right in the mix of my favorite shows, I started to watch it and was very, very surprised. The combination of the characters and the social antic are ones that I can relate to, and thew constant back and forth offers a great laugh.... Not since \\"Friends\\"...<br />I recommend it to all who enjoy good comedy on TV...
0743298039|5.0|Diane Setterfield has a writing style that makes it hard to put this book down. The Thirteenth Tale is an excellent novel that has many twists and turns throughout, ending with an unexpected turn that makes your jaw drop open. I would definitely recommend that people read this at least once, if not again and again. I kept this book for my private collection instead of donating it to the library like I so often tend to do.
B001TH16DI|1.0|.  DO NOT BUY THIS.  PARAMOUNT WILL BE RELEASING THE DIRECTOR'S CUT VERSIONS OF ALL SIX FILMS ONCE THEY MILK THIS VERSION DRY.    STOP!!!   DO NOT BE A FOOL!!!   SAVE YOU MONEY!!!
B001PPLIFU|5.0|This is pure Bond.  Its got boat, car, and plane chases.  Great locations.  Original story. What more could you want.
B0026GBIB6|5.0|this is one very good album. the more i listen to it, the more i like it. the electronic sound of all the synths that mr. gore e-bay'ed is surprisingly coherent and i can honestly say the wait was worth it. it can be listened to if you are feeling jubilant or pensive...the whole thing just works. no dud tracks and nothing you'd skip over to get \\"to the good stuff\\".<br /><br />pretty awesome. hope you enjoy.
B001JFZ118|4.0|Maybe not in the traditional sense, but a classic all the same to any of us who saw the film when it originally played.  The subsequent films do not measure up by any stretch!  Not much in the way of extra features and the additional 6 minutes are hardly noticed, but one can hope that eventually there will be some sort of anniversary edition including MORE.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|Craig is just a great Bond.  I like what they have done with the franchise and the tone is pitch perfect for the times.  Bond is brutal and ruthless, he is also in a bad place after Casino Royal.  You are also starting to see glimpses of the tone Craig will be using in the feature.  His interaction with organization at the Opera portion of the movie is almost playful but efficient very fun to watch.  Bond(Craig) and M (Dench) interactions are a pleasure to watch, both high power actors that seem to enjoy playing of each other a lot.  Is a perfect film no but  it a huge improvement over almost any Bond movie in the very  long run on movies.  I sometime enjoy the Bond movies with Coney in them and one or two of the Roger Moore films, but over all i give the franchise a wide berth.  The producers with Craig and change of tone have start to make movies that most Bond fans he are not addicted to camp and like a little more meat on the bones of the spy films can enjoy.  The movie looks great the story movies along with very little fuss but gripping as it unfolds. The female lead Olga Kurylenko seems to have not fit the part and a little out of sorts in the big buck blow up but has a few good moments and does not throw the film off.   I refuse to say who the best Bond it but I will say who by far is the best actor to ever play the role and hands down that is Craig. He has made some interesting movies outside the franchise and hope he will continue.
B000GFLEAY|5.0|I saw the last half hour of Seabiscuit on television - enough to know I had to buy the DVD, which I loved. Recently I bought a new condition Toshiba HD-DVD player, as much for it's value in upscaling DVD's as for playing some of my brother's HD-DVD's. I then decided to import ten of my favourite films on HD-DVD from Amazon - most were at ridiculously low prices. \\"Seabiscuit\\" is simply magnificent in HD-DVD. There's absolutely everything to like about this film, and with each viewing I am more impressed. In fact I can't think of any reason to rate any of the thousands of films which I like and respect higher than Seabiscuit.    Tobey Maguire's flawless acting is probably one of the main keys to its success - and as one of the executive producers he deserves to be exceedingly proud.     HD-DVD's slogan \\"the look and sound of perfect\\" is proven true in this disc.
0674032810|5.0|Received an advance copy of this book.    Apart from the odd cover-art, this is a truly beautiful book, cloth bound in bold orange color with gold embossed title on spine, very well bound, well printed on heavy/creamy paper stock.    The preface is an excellent overview of CD's life & work, and the annotations are worth owning.
B001TK3XO0|5.0|This book could - or should? - be must reading to all those interested in the state of our world today.  Although it is a novel, I have learned enough about the culture so far to believe that the portrayal of the plight of at least some of the women in Afghanistan is quite accurate.  My heart goes out to my sisters there, as it does to my sisters everywhere, who find themselves in an almost impossible living situation that they did not choose - or even if they did make the choice, only to discover that it did not turn out as they had hoped and expected.  I found this book hard to put down.
0307388921|5.0|I love all this man has written, this has to be one of my favs.   I literally broke out laughing on the subway while reading.    CLICK ADD RIGHT NOW!!! you will not be disapointed!
B001UE276A|5.0|Get it, listen to it, watch it.  Depeche Mode has literally made the best album of the universe.  Fantatic 12th alblum.  Wrong is sharp.  Corrupt has snibits of Wrong.  Oh well is syntho for the 21st century.  Remixes are fantastic.  Great job, DM!
0812971825|5.0|Like Strout's first novel, [[ASIN:0375705198 Amy and Isabelle: A novel]], this is excellently written, interesting and a wonderful read.  One of the great pleasures of reading her books is that I hate to put them down.<br /><br />In this book, a young Congregational minister moves to a small Maine town with his wife and daughter.  Shortly after moving there, his wife has another child and then she dies fairly quickly from brain cancer.  It would be difficult for anyone not to question their faith after this.  Additionally, the loss of her mother is so traumatic for the older daughter that she stops talking and begins acting out and having tantrums in school.  The minister leaves his younger daughter with his mother and tries to care for his older daughter with the help of a housekeeper.  It is very difficult to accept the fact that his daughter is troubled.<br /><br />The book examines the meaningful, poignant and sometimes conflicted  relationships that the minister has with his congregation and his family.  It is also about the relationships between people in this small town.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for its beauty, lyricism and readability.
0762434279|1.0|i thought i was buying a real book. not a nic nak. it said no where that this was one of those small nic nak books. when i said something to the seller i got no answer. they ripped me off and im pissed!! want a big book not some stupid nic nak book that i payed 10 bucks for. not a happy person about that.[...]
B000000OAL|5.0|This album was my first exposure to Queen.  I was never to be the same.  This was the standard by which hard rock would be held from now on.  Two thousand albums and cd's later, and that is still true.  There were no hits on this album at the time.  Most of the people I know heard this album after one of the other, more popular, Queen albums.  Queen turned into a pop - top 40, act, after the commercial success of News of the World.  Some of the later stuff was designed strictly to produce top 40 hits, and cash in on the disco craze.  This seems to be the Queen most people know, but it is not the Queen they started out to be.
B001RTP48G|4.0|\\"Yes\\", the 10th studio album from the Pet Shop Boys, is a solid album and a pleasant surprise after the somewhat disappointing \\"Release\\" and \\"Fundamental\\".  Is it the best thing since \\"Very\\"?  Quite possibly.  There really isn't a bad song in the bunch.  Politics take a back seat this time around, and the lyrics focus on more personal issues - love and relationships (both the successful and failed variety)  Johnny Marr returns to contribute some guitar (and harmonica) work.  Some of you may be disappointed to hear that there is no huge, overblown production like \\"Go West\\" this time around (I confess to being mildly disappointed myself).<br /><br />My personal favorites (so far): \\"All Over The World\\" (reminds me of a more beat-heavy \\"Se A Vida E\\"), \\"King of Rome\\" (a somber ballad in the vein of \\"Do I Have To?\\"), \\"Pandemonium\\" (an upbeat stomper) and the odd closer, \\"Legacy\\" (as another reviewer noted, similar in feel to something off of \\"Behaviour\\").  I was a little disappointed with \\"This Used To Be The Future\\" on the bonus disc - it's nice to hear from Phil Oakey, but something about the song just didn't work for me.  The dub mixes are pretty much what you'd expect.<br /><br />A couple of notes about the package itself: the set comes in a folding glossy cardboard case that - for some reason - is 6\\" long rather than the standard 5.5\\", as I discovered when I tried to put it into the storage compartment in my car's dashboard and it wouldn't fit.  I can tell that the extra half-inch is going to cause me annoyance.  It also comes with a booklet containing the lyrics to all of the songs and the production credits.<br /><br />If you have stuck with the Pet Shop Boys to this point, I don't have to urge you to pick this one up - you probably already have.  If you are new to the Pet Shop Boys, you could do worse than start with \\"Yes\\".  Thanks Neil and Chris!
B001FOPODS|1.0|This is completely different from anything you would expect from a film entitled Peter and the Wolf - not so bad, but unexpected. More importantly I can only play it on my PC DVD player not the TV DVD player as I am in South Africa and it is the wrong region for the disc sent!!!!
0316017922|4.0|A friend reccommended \\"Outliers\\" to me when I was looking at a change in business focus......it opened my eyes to how I should make my move with my business direction and how I to identify opportunity.  Simply put, the best book I have read in some time.
B001UW58YU|3.0|I must tell you that Working for The Philadelphia Spectrum for many years we had Josh Groban Last year at our Wachovia Center for the first time and I was so pleased that he was so nice backstage to everyone something that many performrs are not.Just for that reason and a great voice to boot get this dvd.One Thing I must say is that I think Blu Ray discs were suppose to be so much more than regular dvd,s but as prices fall I find that the companies are skimping on the material that Blu Ray can Hold which is in excess of 7 times what a regular dvd can...Get with the program Motion Picture Companies Blu Ray is special lets keep it that way
B001IBIQU6|5.0|Trust me folks...give this album a few listens as many of the songs continue to grow and evolve. In Chains is amazing and I can't get it out of my head, as are Peace, Wrong, and Come Back. Quite stellar! Nice work boys!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|a couple of my favorite things mixed into one. anime and daft punk. this video is great to sit down and watch and also great to have on the tv while doing something else. what more could i ask for?
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout video was just what I was looking for. High intesity in a short amount of time.  When you don't have a lot of time to workout this is perfect!  I hope her other videos are like this one.  Level three is the hardest but also my favorite.  I worked out moderatly before this. Did level one the first 5 days level two for 4 days then moved up to level 3. It gets you sweating that's for sure!
B0026GBIB6|5.0|I have been a devoted fan of Depeche Mode since high school (in the 1980's), and of course own every album. They are musical legends! I agree that their most recent albums (since Exciter) are an acquired taste...they grow on you after several listens, but are extraordinary.    Sounds of the Universe is very atmospheric. After my first listen so far: Wrong, Jezebel, Corrupt, Little Soul and Fragile Tension are my favorites.  Dave and Marin's voices are simply gorgeous as always!    Can't wait to see them live on the Tour of The Universe this summer!
0743289692|5.0|This was such an incredible book.  It far exceeded my expectations for a memoir, because Ayaan Hirsi Ali has lived such an exceptional life.  To read this book is to realize how a girl from an exiled Somali family can experience what has transformed her into one of the West's leading figures for freedom.  She stands for the freedom of Islamic women in particular, and freedom of thought in general.    Anyone familiar with Ayaan Hirsi Ali will likely approach her book with pre-conceived notions.  Since she is a well-known opponent of Islamic radicalism and of ongoing Islamicization in Europe, one might expect a political treatise, with extended defense of theory.  Her own opponents might expect an angry diatribe against Muslims as a whole.  What makes Infidel a truly great book is that Ali's story illustrates how her beliefs arose strongly, and organically, from personal experience.      Most Westerners simply cannot relate to the circumstances she grew in, the hardships she and her family endured in three African countries and in Saudi Arabia, before she finally escaped to Europe.  It is there that she finally blossomed, became educated and, seeing blindness around her to the Islamist threat, was moved to venture into politics in the Dutch Parliament.  She does not demand pity for her early poverty or for the times when she or her family were refugees from turmoil.  Her story is multi-dimensional, full of interesting and often pathetic characters.  You will find angry, Islamic fundamentalists but Ali recognizes other good characters where it is deserved.  You will also find profile in depth, especially of her father, who encouraged her and led a resistance movement in Somalia for much of Ali's youth.     There is a great personal story here, made even greater by the writer's understated style, about how living with personal convictions eventually impacts political life.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali did not talk herself into her role, but she couldn't escape it either.  She reveals how persecution of young women and control of young minds is integral to life in the Arab world. Infidel is a testament to liberty, and reading it will inspire those who understand that individual freedom should be the most cherished of Western values.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was an excellent sequel to Casino Royale. Daniel Craig gives Bond the edginess that he has lacked for soooo long! 5 Stars!
1595141979|5.0|I got way more than I expected from this book. Honestly this series of books is better than any of them out there. If you like this type of book, buy this entire series, you will not be disappointed.
B001P9KR8U|1.0|I have to be the odd one out on this movie. I was emotionally drained by this film. I saw this with my neighbors and one person had problems with following from childhood to adulthood of the main characters, one person had a hard time with the sound and trying to read subtitles, one of the group had a nightmare. I personally, think it is an extremely violent movie. I don't care if it really happens in other countries, the amount and feeling like there was no time to recover between everything left me emotionally and physically drained. So, what is the happy good feeling? Two bad guys are killed, guy gets girl and wins his money. It isn't worth all the suffering you have to watch to get to this point which, almost all the good is the last 10 minutes after over 2 hrs of all the other horrors.
B000H6SXLU|4.0|I found this to be a very entertaining musical with some decent mixture of songs, comedy and romance. There are no less than three leading ladies and they all look good. Two of them are big names: Irene Dunne and Ginger Rogers.    There's Fred Astaire in here, too, so I guess we can call this another \\"Astaire-Rogers film.\\" If so, I think it's one of their best and certainly one of their most underrated. You don't hear much about this movie, and that's unfair.    Rogers and Astaire both have some funny lines in this film and I wish Ginger's role had been bigger. She and Astaire do a couple of tap dance numbers that are excellent - some of their best work together. Dunne's first two songs aren't bad but you have the rest. Her soprano voice almost broke my eardrums, especially with \\"Smoke Gets In Your Eyes.\\"    Randolph Scott, Helen Westley and Claire Dodd also star in this dated-but-generally fun movie.
B0026GBIB6|3.0|First of all, I am not, nor have I ever been a Depeche Mode fan. I love electronic music, but for whatever reason, never really listened to Depeche Mode. I was really excited when I heard \\"Wrong\\" for the first time on the radio. It was a fantastic song that got stuck in my head for days. When I saw that Amazon had the MP3 version of this album for $3.99, I figured I would give it a shot...I kind of wish I had not.<br /><br />\\"Wrong\\" doesn't fit in with the rest of the CD in the least bit, save for maybe \\"Corrupt.\\" The rest of the album just has a very generic, watered down sort of feel. Most of the songs except \\"Jezebel,\\" \\"Wrong,\\" and \\"Corrupt\\" sound like generic lobby music you would hear playing in any corporate building.<br /><br />In the end, unless you are a Depeche Mode fan, most of the album will be forgettable at best. It's not bad...it's just not...much.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Ms Swift's album has achieved what a lot of other albums could not - a disc full of great songs, in my opinion, \\"single\\" quality ones.    Ms Susan Boyle is a great singer, and I love her for who she is and her heavenly voice.  Ms Swift is definitely not at Ms Boyle's vocal level, but still, she holds her own. With her smooth saccharine voice AND beautiful appearance, it makes for a great package - looks and voice.   She's one artiste who makes you want to listen to her music AND look at her album art at the same time :)
B00006D295|1.0|be side the time warp the movie quit borning    recommend downloading it, ;)
0786838655|5.0|This book was a whole lot of fun.  The premise here is that the Greek gods are real and that they continue to have kids with mortals (half-bloods or demi-gods).  Percy Jackson is one such boy although he doesn't find out until he's 12 or so and even then he doesn't believe it and doesn't know who his father is.    We follow him as he learns who he is and what he can do.  He has to go on a quest and solve several mysteries.  The characters are fantastic, very well-developed and full of real emotion.  All of the original Greek gods and goddesses are here as well as some of their half-blood children.  There is a lot of humor and action and mystery.  I couldn't put it down.    I'm seriously thinking about using this during our study of the Greek gods as it helps you remember or learn who they all are in a very fun, very exciting way.  If we don't specifically use it for \\"school\\" I'll have them read it just for fun.    Do be warned that they say \\"oh my gods\\" a lot.  And they briefly talk about God, as in 'we're not even going to discuss whether He exists or not because He's on a totally different level than the Greek ones.'      If you're not a Greek god type person, you won't like this. But if you like mythology and/or really well-written books you'll love it.    *taken from my review at goodreads
B0000UJDLM|4.0|certaining different from the second one, as i own and seen the second first before buying this one.    it very good and i rather enjoy it, there are some great scene, and worth buying if you own the second one, as they are both completey different and worth comparing.
060601215X|4.0|I first saw the film version of this book in high school - and had been well-acquainted with the acting prowess of Jack Nicholson by then. So while the movie made me jump a few times, it never truly frightened me. Jack Nicholson never became anyone other than Jack Nicholson to me, and so this book never made it that high into my evergrowing To-Read pile. But after being surprised by the differences between the film and novel versions of [[ASIN:0451161351 Cujo]], I decided to brush off the dust and crack open this spine.<br /><br />And  I enjoyed this book quite a bit - much more than the movie, that's for sure! The \\"creepy\\" factor genuinely gave me some chills, which really surprised me - though not as much as the almost \\"fantasy\\" genre elements to the story that were not as fully explored in the film adaptation. Though my experience with King's writing is not extensive, I must say that I enjoyed this one much more than the rather tragic [[ASIN:0451161351 Cujo]]. It had a really interesting premise and some very tense pacing. It was hard to put down, and more than any other King novel that I have read, this one makes me want to immediately pick up another one by him!
6305311463|4.0|Earth is in trouble once again. An asteroid the size of Texas is headed straight for our planet. Life will be extinguished once it hits. Every plan that NASA or any government agency from any country seems futile. Except one. The plan is to drill 800 feet into the asteroid and drop a nuke down there to blow up the asteroid from the inside and hopefully ejecting the pieces far enough from each other to completely miss Earth. Though NASA is trained in many things and are geniuses at many things, drilling is just not their forte. So they look for the number one driller in the country... Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis). Harry runs an oil rig out in the ocean with his rag tag crew along with his daughter. Wherever he goes, they go. So when NASA proposes/begs for Harry to help them, he says he'll do it as long as the rest of the crew comes with. With only 17 days until the asteroid hits, they have 12 days to train and then launch into space along with actual astronauts to dig a hole into a rock and blow it up.<br /><br />Michael Bay, whether you love him or hate, can put some crazy action scenes together. Sometimes they are really good, and sometimes they are edited just enough to where you can't really see what's going on. I am a sucker for a Michael Bay film though. I'll watch them all. I might not like them all, but I will watch them all. I liked Transformers, yet I hated it also. And I'll definitely see Transformers 2. I know the man isn't the best director in the world but I'll go into his movies every time shutting my brain completely off and enjoy the heck out of some crazy intense action scenes.<br /><br />The first time I saw Armageddon was about 5 months after I had joined the military. Group of us went to see this in the theaters, and every one of us sat back and enjoyed the ride. All the action, the funny lines, the military/NASA scenes, space, explosions, and hot women were everything us boys were looking for in a movie. Even today, while I've grown up over those last 11 years, it's still a fun ride. Eye rolling yes, but fun ride none-the-less. To really enjoy a Michael Bay movie, you really do have to throw reality out the window. I'll give just ONE example of what I mean. While watching this the other night, me and my friend were commenting on the `things that just aren't right' in the movie and one was fire. There was fire in outer space. One of the space shuttles crash onto the rock and pieces of it were on fire. Really? There's no oxygen, but it was burning like a camp fire. I said it, my friend laughed, and then said \\"let it go.\\" And that's what ya gotta do with these types of movies.<br /><br />Though you can constantly pick out the bad from a Bay movie, there is just a lot that is usually good also, but people tend to try and ignore it, or just plain out don't care and just want to bash it anyways. Bruce Willis plays, once again, a great apple pie eating American hero. He's just made for it. And it works 100%. From his funny lines, to his `I won't take no for an answer' attitude, and to his sweet and protective fatherly moments... he's just the man. Liv Tyler is great as the `sort of angry at her father daughter, yet slightly shows it in her eyes that she loves him' daughter. She's great at the water works and definitely tries to pull the strings on mine when lets it go. Ben Affleck is definitely funny, but sometimes a little over the top. But it's ok with me because I'm a fan of Ben. Yeah I said it. I think he's funny. Watch some commentaries with him, especially with Kevin Smith (Silent Bob), on some movies he does, and you probably will bust out laughing. Because of his commentaries, and outtakes, and other little things he does, I've grown to like him more and more as an actor. Steve Buscemi is a god of course in just about everything he does and it's the same here. I didn't like the whole space madness thing at the end with him, but still, at least he's funny. It's not only the actors themselves that are funny, but the whole chemistry between them. Everyone just seemed like they were having a good time making this movie and it really shows when you see the groups of guys together doing whatever they are doing at that time.<br /><br />I didn't watch most of the extras on this Criterion, but I did watch the outtakes (I always watch those). It was pretty funny, but wow there were a lot of F bombs. I don't mind at all, but I'm sure most do, so be prepared. Most from Billy Bob...hehe. And the trailers were pretty good to. I like how you think Armageddon is going to be some love story between Affleck and Liv Tyler, and then all of a sudden, BOOM, meteorites are flying through NY tearing it to shreds. Funny trailer.<br /><br />In the end, if you like your popcorn summer action flicks where you don't really have to think that much, then step right up and watch Armageddon. I still love this movie to this day no matter how over the top and silly it can get.<br /><br />P.S. When I watched this in the theater I was without about 10 military guys. One of the guys, who was sitting a row in front of me, started to sniffle and turn his head. I said \\"Hey \\"enter name here\\"... you crying man?!?!\\" pretty loud and he said \\"NO!\\" with sniffles and tear wipes. Hilarious considering he's was one of those `I'm hard' types of guys. Also hilarious since all the people around us started laughing with us. Ah...memories.try between them. Everyone just seemed like they were having a good time making this movie and it really shows when you see the groups of guys together doing whatever they are doing at that time.     I didn't watch most of the extras on this Criterion, but I did watch the outtakes (I always watch those). It was pretty funny, but wow there were a lot of F bombs. I don't mind at all, but I'm sure most do, so be prepared. Most from Billy Bob...hehe. And the trailers were pretty good to.

I still love this movie to this day no matter how over the top and silly it can get.      P.S. When I watched this in the theater I was without about 10 military guys. One of the guys, who was sitting a row in front of me, started to sniffle and turn his head. I said \\"Hey \\"enter name here\\"... you crying man?!?!\\" pretty loud and he said \\"NO!\\" with sniffles and tear wipes. Hilarious considering he's was one of those `I'm hard' types of guys. Also hilarious since all the people around us started laughing with us. Ah...memories.
B001TOD92C|4.0|In a nutshell, the movie is about a wrestler still performing despite peaking 20 years prior.  He's completely bankrupt -- his relationships have failed, he's broke, and his daughter hates him.  He ends up working weekends at a deli counter until the ring calls him back for one match, a re-match with the Ayatollah 20 years after they last wrestled at MSG.      Rourke's performance was powerful, raw, and honest.  He had me convinced that he was Ram himself.   Of course, playing Ram wasn't much of a stretch for a burned-out, has-been actor who tried to make a living as a boxer, but Rourke took the natural advantages his life gave him and turned out the best performance I've seen in a while.      As others have said, this is not a wrestling movie. Although wrestling is the backstory, the movie is really about a flawed man still clinging to the one thing that brings him glory, despite its ugly and painful consequences.
1401203078|1.0|The first two volumes of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen are pure brilliance. Moore is simultaneously at his most clever and his most accessible - creating two adventures that both comic book lovers and comic book newcomers could enjoy. His spectacular literary wiles made for engaging and rewarding stories, more than ably backed up by the terrific art and coloring.    Unfortunately, the Black Dossier lacked the filter of accessibility. Rather than challenging and rewarding the reader, like Moore did so successfully with League, Watchmen and Top 10, Black Dossier spirals into vanity, madness and despair. Not only does he succumb to the seductions of world-building instead of character development, the majority of the book is so wildly experimental and devoid of plot as to completely alienate the reader (casual or devotee).    Clearly, the book has its fans, and, like all of Moore's work, it is worthy of some attention - Moore's intelligence, breadth of knowledge and writing ability are the best in the game. He normally, however, tempers his work with the audience in mind. The Black Dossier, however, is so aggressively weird that it should disappoint all but the most hardened fans.    Shame. I never thought I'd be one-starring a book by Alan Moore, but my disappointment after reading Black Dossier was palpable. Moore has enough venues for his vanity projects without having to shatter one of his staples as well.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I for one am pleased as punch to not have to sit through an extra four minutes of footage from the 2001 so-called \\"Director's Cut\\" of the first film.  I have long thought the new version contained many ill-advised and unnecessary cuts, gaudy CGI effects and a heavy-handed audio mix to boot.  Overall, the new version left me with a sour taste in my mouth, and the whole thing came off as being a bit self-indulgent to my tastes.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to be able to enjoy this 1979 film in it's original form, where at least it actually resembles a film that might have been made in 1979.  Furthermore, I've become a bit tired of this new \\"remaster\\" process they speak of.  It seems that these days \\"remastering\\" has more to do with rewriting and re-cutting than a simple clean-up.  Leave these films alone, and accept the fact that they're old.<br /><br />Wanna make fancy new CGI landscapes of Vulcan?  Then make a NEW movie, and leave my favorite old films alone.<br /><br />I for one will happily purchase this beautiful new blu-ray release of some great, classic films, and provide a reasonable four-star review to offset the load of BS coming from everyone else out there on this ridiculous thread.
B001UW58YK|4.0|Caught In The Act is the only good dvd Michael has ever put out. I hope there are some new stuff on the BLU-RAY version. Region one is not playable in Australia, so I'm waitimg for the right format.

B001FBSMF8|5.0|I am a big fan of Soundgarden and Audioslave and expected more of the same with this CD but was blown away by the first track. I wasn't sure this was actually Chris Cornell but the voice is one of a kind. Not only is it completely different but I am hooked by at least 7 or 8 of the 13 tracks and haven't stopped playing it for four days.  OK, absolutely not what was expected but if you like music outside the rock genre, you will probably really enjoy this.  I personally hope the next solo CD he does is in this same style.
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|Here comes Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, the prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark. This is where Indy (Harrison Ford), his sidekick Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan, credited as Ke Huy Quan) and nightclub singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) arrive at an Indian village attacked by Thugge troops that stole their Shainkara Stone and the children.         The trio finds their hideout in Pankot Palace. There they encounter the leader and main antagonist Mola Ram (Amrish Puri), which is where things heat up. This entry was dark and gritty unlike the rest. It was George Lucas' idea. He knew that in the Star Wars series, The Empire Strikes Back was the darkest of the original trilogy (and also the best in the franchise), and wanted the Indiana Jones classic trilogy to have the same feel. The really scary parts are the child slavery depiction, ripping out the heart, volcanic sacrifices, and the blood of Kali potion forced into Indy's mouth. The most disgusting part was the Pancot cuisine, consisting of snake surprise (with eels inside the skin), bettles, eyeball soup, and chilled monkey brain. Gross! On the other hand, the cast and crew were great. It has all the action. The underground sequense looks so real. This, along with Gremlins, helped spawn the PG-13 rating used in the more lighthearted and successful sequels. This can be handeled by kids when a parent is supervising them. This may be the darkhorse of the franchise, but still a worthy entry to the series.
B000A6T1JU|3.0|I am a pretty big fan of this film and had been wanting to see it again for several months before I purchased it from Amazon.  I got myself all ready to watch it...dark room, popcorn, Dots, etc.  I was pumped.  But the director chose to make some pretty serious changes to the movie.  He, apparently, always thought there was a comic book flavor to the film (which I can see) and so he added comic book scenes into this version of the movie.  I didn't care for them.  Throughout most of the film I was able to get over it (although I found them jarring), but the ending of the movie was JUST AWFUL.  One of my favorite parts of the film is watching everyone walk down the beach to \\"In the City\\".  He removed this part and just had it end with a comic book scene of them on the beach.  I hated it and am still very disappointed.  I wish I could get my hands on the original version of this film.
0743497465|4.0|Reading a Dan Brown book and giving it poor reviews based on its accuracy it like giving a Tom and Jerry cartoon a bad review becuase mice dont really hit cats with frying pans.<br />Yes, there are some really bad inaccuracies and \\"Could never happens\\"<br />Yes, the character development is not great<br />Yes, it follows the exact same plots as his other novels<br />But, you know what? I dont read thrillers for their accuracies. I dont care about the poor character development. I wanted a bit of action, a bit of suspense and a bit of imagination. I got all three. If youre looking for something taht can \\"truely happen\\", read Tom Clancy. If you just want something you can read and not have to think about and just enjoy the story for what it is, this will surely get you there.
B000J103PC|4.0|Look, I don't even know what \\"prada\\" is (nor am I inclined to take the time to find out).  What I do know is I've seen THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA several times, and I find it a clever and engaging comedy for two reasons:  Because Anne Hathaway is so absolutely delightful and because Meryl Streep is so absolutely good.<br /><br />Playing a New York newbie who's hired to be an assistant to an editor of a chic fashion magazine, Hathaway brings an innocent naivete that is appealing and genuine.  Plus she's easy on the eye; I find her to be one of the most beautiful actresses on the big screen today.  And then there's Meryl Streep as the beastly Miranda Priestly--the boss who won't take \\"No\\", or \\"I can't get that done\\" for an answer.  We've all had bosses from hell, but Miranda easily sets the bar as the most self-centered, diabolical, conniving--duplicitous.  And all the while, Streep plays this role in a soft-spoken manner; her Miranda may appear to be in control, but the volcano could erupt at any moment.  And is it ever fun to watch.<br /><br />Adrian Grenier, Stanley Tucci, and Simon Baker furnished the main male roles in this film, and none of them (count 'em) were interesting (okay, maybe Tucci's role as a frustrated fashion designer was a tad interesting); this, I think, was intentional.  THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is a flick made for chicks.  Speaking of, I enjoyed Emily Blunt as the stressed other assistant willing in an instant to fall on her sword for Miranda; Blunt gets more than her fair share of funny scenes.  But she doesn't tell me what prada is.  But that's okay.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]

0060557818|2.0|There really wasn't a whole lot to this book, and after seeing so many positive reviews of it, I had to give my opinion.    As the title of this review suggests, this book is overall forgettable and not worth the money to read. I liked the premise, but I didn't at all care for the characters, everything seemed rush and the 'villain' of the story and his reasons for being said villain come out of nowhere AT THE END OF THE BOOK.    The problem is that in the end, there's nothing that makes it stand out.

0156907399|5.0|--\\"The subject of this brilliant novel is the daily life of an English family in the Hebrides.\\" That's the copy description on the back cover of my edition of \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" I found it hilarious. I laughed for five minutes.<br /><br />--So it's an inadequate description of the novel?<br /><br />--Inadequate is an inadequate word to describe just how inadequate it is.<br /><br />--So what is \\"To the Lighthouse\\" about?<br /><br />--Well that's just the thing. To say it's about a family vacationing by the shore, about the delicate relationships between them and their friends, about how time changes them and their relationships between each other...is to miss the point entirely even if it is perfectly accurate.<br /><br />--As I understand it, this is a novel in which ten years passes in about fifteen pages, while the rest of the novel meticulously describes two days.<br /><br />--Yes, exactly. Like Proust, Woolf  begins with a childhood incident that will echo down through the years. Like Joyce, she concentrates on the epiphanic moment. Reading \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is a bit like viewing a painting in which the characters move...but very slowly. Woolf passes from character to character, inhabiting each of their minds in turn, seeing the world through their eyes. Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay and their flawed but enduring marriage are the central bodies around which the rest orbit and Lily Briscoe, a spinsterish amateur painter, ostensibly stands in for Woolf herself, but it is hard to say that any of the characters are less or more important than any of the others--this is essentially the genius of Woolf's handling of psychological perspective. Everyone has a point of view and each point of view is essential to attain a vision of the whole.<br /><br />--But it is a novel essentially about family relationships?<br /><br />--And relationships between men and women, men and society, women and society, human beings and the inescapable fact of their mortality. Again and again, Woolf asks the question, \\"What does life mean? What is it for?\\"<br /><br />--Does she have an answer?<br /><br />--Yes. And no.<br /><br />--It's ambiguous.<br /><br />--It's provisional. But it's enough to help Lily make it through the dark storm of life to use a perfectly horrible metaphor. It's her lighthouse.<br /><br />--Woolf has a reputation as a difficult author to read.<br /><br />--And it's well-deserved. She is a difficult read for the majority of readers, who, let's face it, are awaiting Dan Brown's new novel as if it were a major event in world literary history. What happens in \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" when anything happens at all, isn't as important as how it affects each character internally. That is to say, Woolf's focus is on the fleeting but all-important impressions that the world leaves on us and that ultimately make us who we are. Her greatest gift is to capture these gossamer-thin states in a language of exquisite accuracy--capturing in words the flavor of fleeting emotions seldom if ever described before, even as they evaporate on the tongue.<br /><br />--You would have to love language, then, to fully appreciate her work.<br /><br />--Indeed. Her sentences don't move the story forward; they move the story deeper. She writes a poetic prose that many contemporary readers might mistake for unnecessarily flowery and overwrought--when, in fact, it is sharp as a surgeon's scalpel and cuts to the heart. And yet for all its surgical accuracy, it is the sensuous prose of a writer for whom language is like a box of brilliant colors is to a painter, for whom sentences are like caresses to a lover, except that in this case what is touched are the most potently orgasmic areas of our brains--needles to say, the ones most difficult areas to reach.<br /><br />--But Virginia Woolf reaches them?<br /><br />--You might say she's a master masseuse.<br /><br />--Ha ha. Does she provide a happy ending?<br /><br />--No, not exactly. But it's a deeply satisfying experience all the same.
0312360266|2.0|This is an easy teen read, I would suggest it for a younger reading age of 11-13 except for the fact that it has vulgar language and sexual content. I purchased the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th books in anticipation of this one arriving in hopes that they would be good reads. I have read all 5 books since this one arrived a few weeks ago and the story line doesn't get any better. The plot is scattered and it's mostly a roller coaster of boy drama.

1401207138|5.0|I'd not read Watchmen since its debut 20 years ago but after seeing the movie I decided to purchase a copy.  I sort of accidentally picked the \\"Absolute Edition\\", but it was well worth it.  The price isn't too (maybe a little) much and the presentation is excellent.  I'm only a so-so fan though I love both the movie and the book and this edition is worthwhile for even a casual fan who feels like forking out a little extra cash.  The inter-issue extras are nice, though I'm not sure if you find those in a lesser edition.  Mostly what this has going for it is the quality of the binding and the quality of the paper.  The case also looks nice up on my bookshelf.<br /><br />As it says in the review title, I saw the IMax version of the movie and decided to purchase the IMax version of the graphic novel.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I will admit, I was disappointed through the first listen - but the album grew on me quickly.  The musical landscape is comprised of mostly chaotic analog sounds, mixed with some raw guitars, with random blips and bleeps thrown in for good measure. Hidden beneath the layers is a soulful connection to the listener that was somewhat absent on their previous album, Playing the Angel (still an outstanding effort), and dare I say, Violator. This effort is an evolution of Depeche Modes past. This is nothing like Violator, or Songs of Faith and Devotion, or Ultra, or Exciter, or PTA - just as Violator was nothing like its predecessors, this is a progression of a band that continually reinvents themselves while staying true to their roots of the sadness and hopefulness of reality.  Standout tracks include:  In Chains, Hole to Feed, Wrong, Perfect, Miles Away/The Truth is, Corrupt.    For this particular CD, one listen will not do it justice;  turn off the lights, throw on your headphones, and lose yourself to the chaotic melody that is Sounds of the Universe.
B001AP11KW|4.0|Although it's not as facinating as the White Stripes, you gotta give Jack credit for his versatility. Most of this is a late 60s time warp, with a modern edge. Some songs bring to mind the Beatles, Bad Finger and the Moody Blues - but again, with a current twist.
031606792X|1.0|I agree with the poster,  J. Martin \\"Librarian\\". What an awful conclusion to a series.<br />I liked the Twilight somewhat.<br />I really liked the beginning of New Moon until the author went on a tangent with the whole Italy and Volturi aspect. Then it went all downhill from there. Rushed through Eclipse as fast as I could (though it was so uneventful) and HATED Breaking Dawn.<br />I couldn't wait for it to end, but it ended sadly disappointing for me. I thought it was going to be better. I don't understand the author's choices for the story and characters.<br />How are they planning to make this book into a movie?!?<br />At least I got borrowed the books from the library and didn't waste money on them.
B000ETQR3Q|2.0|My son wanted this gun for his birthday...it is all he talked about. The neighborhood kids get together and play with their toy guns. My son was thrilled when this came in and quickly was disappointed when the nerf bullets kept getting stuck....as I have found to be a characteristic of the nerf guns. He now plays with the gun and has to pretend he is firing off bullets because they don't come out properly. What a let down. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone who expects it to work. I think it is a waste of money.
B001P5Q6F2|4.0|Lamb of God are one of the best acts out there with their unrelenting sound that pummels the HELL out of your eardrums. You need to buy this album if you are a real METAL HEAD!<br /><br /> Never has there been a band quite like Lamb of God.

B0026GBIB6|4.0|I am not a DM fan at all I just heard the Wrong single on the radio and decided to pick up the album. I think most of the tracks play and there are only a couple of disappointments. However I did hit replay after I listened to it for the first time so that says something. I would characterize the album overall to be mellow with some catchy riffs. Worth the money!
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|Odessa was the Bee Gees' fourth internationally released album, and their first double album. It was by far their most ambitious release and was had a red-flocked cover and included a poster and sticker. At a certain point the title \\"Masterpeace\\" was considered.<br /><br />The band was still a 5-piece band at the beginning of the recordings, but before the release of the album in 1969, guitarist Vince Melouney had left the group.<br /><br />Though not a direct concept album there are themes about the ship Odessa that runs though the songs. Apart from some long, mostly instrumental orchestral pieces, the music is not really that different from the group's previous releases.<br /><br />To be regarded as a real classic I find the album too uneven, with too many average songs. There are of course a lot songs, too, that ranks with the very best of their early works.  I have always liked their music best without the big arrangements that often burdened good songs too much.<br /><br />Simple songs with great melodies like, \\"Sudddenly\\", \\"You'll Never See My Face Again\\" and \\"I Laugh in Your Face\\" are still my favourites. I also used to like \\"Marley Purt Drive\\", but it seems the songs hasn't aged that well.<br /><br />Among the classic ballads \\"Lamplight\\" is outstanding, and \\"Melody Fair\\" and \\"First of May\\" are both great songs.<br /><br />This 3 CD version contains both mono and stereo versions of the original album, and the third CD contains some very interesting alternate versions along with some previously unreleased songs. Many of these are almost as good as the well-known versions, and a few maybe even better; I especially like the alternate mix of \\"You'll Never See My Face Again\\". The song \\"Barbara Came to Stay\\", is the same tune as \\"Edison\\", with different lyrics, and also one of the great additions. For fans of the group, this deluxe edition of one of their highly praised albums, of course is must.<br /><br />Great reproduction of the original cover and a fine informative booklet too.
B000001A3H|5.0|How the ____ did this band not hit it BIG? Maybe it's better that way but I'm angry at myself for not getting a hold of these guys sooner. I herd of Kyuss 8 years ago when I was learning how to play guitar & I remember a Guitar video from Daron Malakian of SOAD, and he was playing this riff that he said was from Kyuss. Well I never forgot that name just from that little riff and recently I thought I would check em out.<br /><br />Holy mother of God this Album kicks and it's one of the best I have come across in a long long time. I don't get some Metal Heads sometimes. As a Guitar player myself, you can have all the screaming in the world but if there's no \\"Hook\\" then it's just noise. The reason Sabbath was so popular was because it was simple and had HUGE hook. I wish more so called metal bands learned this.<br /><br />I remember when I was a kid & I first herd a Sabbath Album that was my Dad's, I felt like I was listening to something powerful that came from Hell and this album would of made me feel the same way. That's not easy to do.

B0010358CG|5.0|The original Appleseed, in my opinion, was a masterpiece. I had doubts when I heard of a sequel, and how it was being criticized. After watching Appleseed: Ex Machina, I almost wonder if the reviewers and I watched the same film. I found Ex Machina to take me into the neo-future of Olympus with it's new cell-shaded look and amazing 3D animation. The story, still deep and twisted, the action, mind-blowing, and the quality of work is top-notch. I have only praises to give to this masterpiece, and urge others to not miss out on the phenomenon that is Appleseed: Ex Machina.
B000N3ST7K|4.0|I only knocked a star off this because I had purchased it thinking it would please me as much as \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\".  It did. . . for the most part.  There seems to be a lot of songs on here that I didn't hear at all in the movie (irritating) or I had not noticed (equally irritating, since that means the song didn't pop enough for me to notice).  Other than that, not terrible in the least bit.
B000002H2H|5.0|At first sound, the opening song 'Fight Fire With Fire' sounds like a classic rock ballad. But listen just a few more seconds and it will hit you like a rock. This is true Metallica heavy metal. This album was only the second time I've heard of Metallica, but it was worth the wait. My favorite songs are 'Fight Fire With Fire' and 'Fade to Black'. All around this is a great Metallica album a must for any fan! You should also check out the Metallica cover song HATEBREED did!

B000CCBCAS|4.0|FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, made on a pauper's budget, is one of those little British films of which no one was expecting much. Surprisingly, though, it became the little engine that could and garnered much acclaim from fans and critics and cashflow in the theaters. It even shot up to the number one slot in the American box office. This was Hugh Grant's breakthrough film, the one which catapulted him to A-list prominence as a top flight comedic leading man. It made him a star.<br /><br />Thru the course of four weddings (and one devastating funeral), the movie chronicles the on-again, off-again romance of Charles, chronically tardy at weddings and commitment-phobic (his pals call him \\"a serial monogamist\\"), and Carrie, the lovely independent American girl. I got so into this movie that it wasn't until at the end that I realized I didn't even know what these characters - and those in Charles's inner circle - did for a living, only that they seemed to be fairly well-off blokes and girls and a tight-knit, fun-loving bunch of pals. But most of the story does take place within the confines of the weddings (and that one funeral), because those are the only instances in which Charles and Carrie ever interact. But for one exception, that being a sequence in which Charles accidentally bumps into an engaged Carrie and she invites him to accompany her as she tries on different wedding gowns.<br /><br />The screenplay is ridiculously good. And Mike Newell directs it, and I've always liked his stuff (ENCHANTED APRIL, INTO THE WEST, PUSHING TIN, and HARRY POTTER & THE GOBLET OF FIRE). The romance is nice enough, with Charles almost bemusedly wooing the ravishing Andie MacDowell. Back in 1994, when this movie was released, Andie MacDowell was the biggest name on this roster. At that time in her career, she was doing big things, what with GREEN CARD and GROUNDHOG DAY having done well, and this film only served to garner her even more notice. But if I were to nitpick, it'll be to say that we never do get to know her character as well as we come to know Charles. Even by the end of the film, Carrie comes off as enigmatic. But the love story is only one slice of a very savory pie. There's big heart in this terrifically fleshed-out supporting cast, these actors pitch perfect in their parts and most capable of winning over the audience. However, some are more pitch perfect than others, and so I point out Simon Callow as the gregarious Gareth, John Hannah who delivers a magnificent reading of W.H. Auden's \\"Funeral Blues,\\" and Kristin Scott Thomas who underplays it as the acerbic and sad Fiona. Meanwhile, Rowan Atkinson is simply hilarious as the flustered new priest who gets a chance at conducting his first ever marriage ceremony (in which he breaks out \\"the Holy Spigot!!\\" Hah!). But all the actors involved here are wonderful, and that I'd actually feel a measure of sorrow when one of their characters abruptly passes away is a testament to this little film's ability to affect the audience. Charles and his crew, they seem like a great bunch of folks, even if they teeter towards posh.<br /><br />But Hugh Grant owns this film. Hugh Grant wasn't really on Hollywood's radar before this picture, languishing as he was in forgettable made-for-TV films and overseas cinematic no-hopers. FOUR WEDDINGS is the film which, for the first time, showcased Hugh's comedic flair and impeccable timing. If you think he stammers and flutters those eyelids now, brother, he was a lot worse back in the day. But Hugh Grant oozes such charm and demonstrates such a quick and self-deprecating wit that the awkward habits somehow become disarming. For two samples of the man's dexterity with delivering convoluted lines, check out Charles's wedding toast and also his declaration of love for Carrie, with mad references to David Cassidy thrown in.<br /><br />What I have is the Deluxe Edition DVD, which offers these special features: Filmmakers' audio commentary, which is okay and sometimes interesting, although, frankly, I would've preferred Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell's two cents (and anyone else's in the cast, for that matter); 5 deleted scenes with optional commentary by the producer (including more with Rowan Atkinson's novice priest); \\"The Wedding Planners\\" and \\"FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL: In the Making\\" are two behind-the-scenes featurettes; \\"Two Actors and a Director\\" is a 5 minute segment of interviews with Director Mike Newell and Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell; a Behind the Scenes photo gallery; promo spots (pretty funny, actually, with Hugh and Andie each getting a 30 second spot to promote the movie); and the theatrical trailer. Not bad.<br /><br />I can't help but bring up Hugh Grant's later film [[ASIN:B000023VTP Notting Hill (Collector's Edition)]], and partly it's because it holds echoes of FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL. Both films feature an out-of-his-league Englishman romancing an American beauty, although NOTTING HILL is decidedly more fairy tale. Both films have wonderful supporting actors and that tiny whiff of elegance, and both films will make you laugh but then do a one-eighty and make you sad and make you reflect. Oh, but then NOTTING HILL doesn't trot out characters with names like Duckface, Vomiting Veronica, and Miss Piggy. For whatever bragging rights that's worth.etimes interesting, although, frankly, I would've preferred Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell's two cents (and anyone else's in the cast, for that matter); 5 deleted scenes with optional commentary by the producer (including more with Rowan Atkinson's novice priest); \\"The Wedding Planners\\" and \\"FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL: In the Making\\" are two behind-the-scenes featurettes; \\"Two Actors and a Director\\" is a 5 minute segment of interviews with Director Mike Newell and Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell; a Behind the Scenes photo gallery; promo spots (pretty funny, actually, with Hugh and Andie each getting a 30 second spot to promote the movie); and the theatrical trailer.

Both films feature an out-of-his-league Englishman romancing an American beauty, although NOTTING HILL is decidedly more fairy tale. Both films have wonderful supporting actors and that tiny whiff of elegance, and both films will make you laugh but then do a one-eighty and make you sad and make you reflect. Oh, but then NOTTING HILL doesn't trot out characters with names like Duckface, Vomiting Veronica, and Miss Piggy. For whatever bragging rights that's worth.

B001IBIQU6|2.0|I can't even begin to tell anyone out there who bothers to read this review how much it hurts to watch Depeche Mode crumble. Like a lot of hardcore fans, I have been listening to Dave and the boys since 1981 and for me, they were the equivalent of what the Beatles were to the previous generation. I followed every step of Depeche Mode's career with unparalleled enthusiasm - every new single and album seemed to build on the previous release and once Alan Wilder joined the party it all became, well, even more than a party...the marriage of Martin's lyrical and musical development with Alan's studio expertise made for an unstoppable combination. Cue 1995. Once Alan left the party, Depeche Mode ceased to be the Depeche Mode that I followed so religiously for 14 years. I have tried half-heartedly to stomach the adult contemporary feel of Ultra, the dreary (and ironically-named) Exciter, and the vaguely-enjoyable but ultimately perplexing Playing the Angel. Now comes the final insult: SOTU. Martin will always be a musical genius to me, but I implore him to stop with the faux-religion, the faux-blues, the embarrassing rhyming schemes. And please, please, please Dave and Martin, stop with the vocal affectations. I can't take it. I don't recognize this band as the same one that once created the synthetic masterpiece Black Celebration. When Alan walked out on Depeche Mode, he took the magic with him.
0312539517|4.0|In 1924, British climber George Mallory--famous for answering a journalist's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with the words, \\"Because it's there\\"--disappeared after having been last seen just below the summit of the world's tallest mountain. Whether he actually made it to Everest's summit before perishing has remained a topic for debate ever since. With his trademark storytelling flair, Jeffrey Archer has taken a stab at the answer.<br /><br />Though based on the life of a real person, the book is a novel, not a biography. One of Archer's gifts is the ability to blend fact, fiction, and legend so that even a careful reader might have trouble differentiating between them. With the same attention to detail and expert characterization that brought to life the world of high finance in Kane & Abel and the cutthroat competition of the news business in The Fourth Estate, Archer has given readers a potential answer to the question of whether Mallory reached Everest's summit.<br /><br />But the book is far more than simple speculation on the outcome of Mallory's final expedition. Archer explores Mallory's life in detail, including his service in the military and his romance with Ruth Turner, who later became his wife. Through it all, Archer brings Mallory's exploits to life in a way that allows readers to get to know not only the man but also the world in which lived.<br /><br />The book contains no significant objectionable content; if Archer's presentation of his subject's moral character can be believed, Mallory was a man of honor and integrity, and the story happily lacks any of the less savory material found in some of Archer's other books.<br /><br />Jeffrey Archer has been called one of the top storytellers in the world, and while it seems doubtful that anyone would Paths of Glory his best book, it will do nothing to detract from that reputation. Climbing enthusiasts and non-climbers alike will enjoy this account of one of the sport's early pioneers by one of the world's great novelists.velists.

B001TOD92C|5.0|I have never been a fan of wrestling. I had heard little of this film. I watched the trailers on YouTube and thought it might be ok. I went and bought it, if it sucks I sell it on Amazon.    This movie floored me. It is definately a keeper. It sticks with you for hours after you watch it. This movie isn't exactly about wrestling, though wrestling is the stage for this story. This is about a man, dedicated to the one thing he loves and when that one thing he loves is taken away from him and he realizes he is alone with nothing he sets out on a mission to find love and forgiveness.    The main core of this movie is Randy 'The Ram' learning about Robin..his real name. Trying to find love with a woman and make ammends to his daughter. Not very easy to do.    ------Spoilers Below!!!!!!!---------------------------    The last five minutes of this film were astounding to me. Turned away by everyone The Ram makes a suicide dive into the one thing he knows. In response to Marisa Tomei's pleas that he not go into his final battle because he might be hurt he tells her the only place he has been hurt is \\"out there\\" referring to the world.    Rourke was GREAT!!! He should have won best actor for this one. I highly recommend this film to all, even if you are not a wrestling fan..this movie ascends above that.
B001R4KQDE|5.0|This is a top notch blu ray release and will be the one I pop into my PS3 when I want to show off my system. The remastering is of the highest quality as is the sound.     There are a plethora of bonus features included. Some of the best ones are exclusive to the blu-ray version including an interactive comic book which is very creative in its execution.    I loved Sin City when I first saw it in the theater, but the extended cut is superior and the way the directors intended. Separating the stories into different films adds to the continuity of each tale and the added footage fleshes out the storylines. Once you see this version, you'll never want to see the theaterical cut again.    [...]

B001IBIQU6|1.0|To call SOTU \\"lame\\" is an understatement.      I consider myself a huge DM fan from Black Celebration forward.  However, every album, post-Ultra has taken more effort to enjoy.  This piece is the final chapter in letting true depeche fans down.  Martin & Dave continue to boast how this album's tracks are \\"less commercial\\" than past depeche songs.  The irony is, the commercial songs are what made this band great.  Experimenting with new sounds/styles is one thing, abandoning your roots is another.  It's almost as if they despise the commercial success of Violator and SOFAD.    The other irony is how much the band enjoyed working with producer Ben Hillier on PTA.  As a result, they chose him again for SOTU.  According to Fletch, DM has never used the same producer for consecutive albums.  Too bad the trend was not their friend for this release.  He may be gifted in the art of wacky electronic buzzing noises and odd sound effects, but give me Flood or Daniel Miller on their worst days and this band remains relevant, if not great.    Finally, the one staple that I felt would endure was Martin's song writing.  I think this is where the loss of Alan Wilder is most transparent.  According to Martin himself, DM's long standing formula included Marty turning over his demos to Alan for shaping and polishing into the final products.  Sorry Mart, but repeatedly rhyming \\"desire\\" and \\"fire\\" only goes so far.  SOTU discards any form of a classic DM loop, melody or anything that makes a song a song.  On top of that, I hope the cheesy analog synths Marty picked up on eBay did not cost him extra for shipping.  midi files have more depth than the sound quality put out by these things.    To repeat, I'm a long-time fan, not a DM hater.  So writing this review hurts, but not as bad as listening to the album.  For now, I'd rather enjoy the silence.

B001PA0FFO|4.0|The cinematography was wonderful. The acting was superb, definitely Oscar-worthy. Meryl Streep was at her finest, and Amy Adams proved she can do more than sing and dance with her role as Sister James. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was fantastic as usual.<br /><br />Doubt leaves you wondering and debating with your thoughts about tradition and liberalism. The ending made the movie for me.<br /><br />I think the best thing about this movie is Meryl Streep and all her dragon-lady qualities, but I really enjoyed the little compassionate nuances we get to see - most of all in the way she is about Sister Veronica.
0312944926|1.0|After reading (and loving) the DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons I figured Dan Brown is a great author and wanted to read his other books.<br /><br />Wow! What a disappointment it was to read this!<br /><br />This is the worst book I have ever read!

B001GSV3EC|5.0|I saw Beck in '07 with some old h.s. buddies and we were amazed that not only does he play better now than ever, but that he makes it look so effortless.  He used to make it at least look hard.  He was really one of my favorite artists during the \\"Blow by Blow\\" - \\"Wired\\" period.  I also wore out \\"Truth\\" and I still listen to \\"Rough and Ready,\\" which is a great, albeit underrated LP. I didn't care as much for his \\"machine\\" period.

B000N6TYLW|2.0|I loved Gilmore Girls, especially the first 3 seasons. This season just seemed to miss Amy Sherman Palladino and even Daniel Palladino. So much of the spark and great writing seemed to have disappeared. I hated instances such as the episode early in the season where Luke tells Lorelai they never really belonged together, that she belonged with someone like Christopher...that just flew in the face of him obviously having feelings for Lorelai going back to the first episodes of the show. Or later in the season when Luke's sister basically said (I don't know which episode that was, but I'm sure someone who has posted here does) she never thought Luke and Lorelai were right for each other, which went against what she had said in previous seasons. I couldn't quite figure out why Lorelai married Christopher.  I'm surprised this season got so many 5 star reviews from people here.
0486446859|5.0|I bought this while browsing through the illustration section of Amazon.com. The illustration on the cover captured my attention: the soft desaturated tones, the girl's pose and attitude, the flowing of the cards: everything was screaming excellence at me. So I instantly clicked on the buy button. When I recieved it, I was happy. It's not a hardback, but the print quality is excellent. The prints are full of gorgeous illustrations of all periods of Mr. Rackhams career. Some images aren't big enough for my tastes (i prefer the poster book variety), but they are still big enough to appreciate the fine detail that he put in the work. As an illustrator myself, I find the quality of the reproductions and the works worth studying. Highly recommended.
B000SINT52|3.0|The first half tells us the Bin Laden family was given free flights out of the country while planes were grounded after the September 11 attacks. Why? Bush's friend from the National Guard started his own business funded by the Bin Laden family. They became partners in energy and defense industries, and very wealthy. The second half goes into the war in Iraq. Now we might know why we were in Iraq instead of Afghanistan where Bin Laden hides out. A Special Force went in a few feet away from Bin Laden's location. Then the mission was abandoned. It is almost like the Bin Laden family is paying Bush to keep forces in Irag and profits going to defense contractor Haliburton while allowing Osama Bin Laden to get away.  The second half is a gritty depiction of the loss of life in the Iraq war and the way it effects ordinary guys and families from his home town of Flint, Michigan.  I liked it, but two parts are needed so that we don't forget the almost unreported events of the first half.

B000XXC070|5.0|I read Charlotte's Web as a child, and loved it.  Recently I had the pleasure of rereading it with my daughter, taking on a chapter a day. The descriptive phrases E.B. White uses while helping us to fall in love with the characters and their world are wonderful.<br /><br />I will admit I was concerned reading some parts of the story to a 4 year old, whether it be the \\"circle of life\\" comments by Charlotte or the fear of Wilbur being killed.  However, I took it slow, answered questions when needed and had no problems.  Like myself years ago, my daughter had a tear in her eye at the end.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to others, including adults.  Friendship and loyalty in the world today seems to be lacking, and we should all take a step back to breathe and appreciate what we have.<br /><br />J.R.

159102594X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I devoured it and the next two books in the trilogy in around two weeks (fast reading for me, since I don't have a ton of spare time).  Since I read them all in such quick succession, I won't even make an attempt to rate this book as a single piece of work; in any event, you should either buy the whole trilogy or pass on them all, based on your personal tastes.  There's not much point in just buying one.    I have to second what a previous reviewer said, that the author skillfully takes fantasy archetypes and breathes new life into them.  It sounds impossible, but by the end of the series you actually find these characters' personalities believable.  Often, we are guilty of showing characters who have waded through years of unrelenting slaughter and violence without growing dark or disillusioned.  You absolutely will not find that in Abercrobmie's books.  By the end of the third book, all of his characters have gone through significant and plausible developments, both physically and emotionally.  It is admittedly heartbreaking, and part of me was sad to see my beloved characters getting beaten down and changed (often for the worse) by life and its many troubles, but I can't think of a series that I have read recently that made me FEEL so much!  I can't say enough good things about it.    I find it interesting that most people found Glokta, the inquisitor, the most fascinating character.  Personally I found them all interesting in their own way, but my favorite had to be Logen Ninefingers.  I've always wondered why in fantasy novels these warriors with totally wicked reputations always turn out to be nice guys.  If you've ever wondered that, then Logen is your man.  This guy is simultaneously one of the most likeable characters I've ever read about, and the baddest mothertrucker on the planet.  He so desperately wants to be a good man, but events sometimes conspire against him - or it could be that, despite his wishes, he is at heart evil.  Like I said, pretty complex.  And keep in mind, this is just ONE character out of several that the author tries very hard to describe as completely as possible.    I just can't recommend this series enough.  If you are a fan of dark, gritty fantasy told from multiple POVs, you will more than likely enjoy The First Law.    ***ONE CAVEAT***  If you have a hard time stomaching realistic violence, foul language, or semi-graphic sexuality, you will probably be turned off by this series.  If that is you, I completely understand your squeamishness, but you should probably pass.  A lot of people appreciate what is generally termed high fantasy, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  It doesn't make them a less mature reader or anything.  For some it is perfectly satisfying for the author to write, \\"He rushed into battle and slew his enemies with a terrible fury,\\" and leave it at that, without going into all the gory and gratuitous details.  Me, I'm a little more bloodthirsty.  >:)
B000002ADT|5.0|My introduction to jazz was through this album. Now, almost 3000 songs later (and a whole lot poorer), I would make the argument that not only is this the best intro into jazz, it is also an album that no one (jazz fan or not) should be without. Folks, this is as good as music gets. Whether you prefer Mozart, the Beatles, or Rage Against the Machine (all of which I enjoy), you will take away something from this album. This is one of those magical moments in music history where a bunch of musicians at the top of their form tried to push past the boundaries of conventional music, and succeeded in spectacular fashion. This is some of the most soulful playing ever captured on a record. All the tunes are solid and interesting. The musicianship is so tight, and every note is played with such intensity and focus that keeps the listener on the edge of his seat in anticipation of the perfect (but never predictable) resolution that follows.<br /><br />Even if you don't consider jazz your thing, don't discredit this album before giving it a listen.  Kind of Blue is an experience you will not regret.
B00139W3NE|2.0|For those who are familiar with [[ASIN:0375842381 Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials Trilogy]] will be greatly unsatisfied with the adaptation of the fist book in Pullman's trilogy.  Much of the story is left told, some chapters along with characters and groups of character are completely cut out while others are rearranged or switched out, even rewritten. this gives the movie the feeling of being rushed and not fully completed before it hit the screen. Someone should have put more thought into this adaptation before trying to put it on the screen. There was only one thing about this movie that i did find pleasing and that was the casting of the characters.  All the actors preformed the part wonderfully in spite of the over all uncompleted feeling the movie leaves you with.  The actors are the only reason i am giving this movie 2 stars instead of one.
B0026GBIB6|4.0|Have them all. Used to Get all the singles. Their albums progressively changed their music in a different direction and this is the latest example of a difference from the past. Gahan liked the grunge/alternative movement. I never judge the first time I listen but on the second time it grew on me. I liked precious and nothing's impossible and lilian from ... angel but Violator I still think is their complete best album.     Wrong is simple rhyme and simple cliche message but still good. Some of the off standard music and lyrics are a interesting and enjoyable.     Anyway...for $3.99 it's worth a try for even the non-fan. I will probably never by a CD if they stick to this correct pricing for digital versus physical. Not sure what it is on I tunes...but now I will try Amazon first always.

B001CW7MFQ|5.0|I am a music fanatic. I enjoy music of all genres. I have a huge cd library. Out of all the music I listen to, this is an album I never tire of, and one I can honestly say is one of my favorite albums BY ANYONE, EVER. It was my introduction to the great talent of Mike Patton, whose many other works and collaborations are amazing as well, but back to Angel Dust. Angel Dust takes you on a dark, atmospheric journey, and one you will want to experience again and again. Each song is an amalgam of sounds and styles, making it indescribable. It is unlike anything Faith No More (or anyone else for that matter) have done before, or since. I realize I have not really said anything that would really tell someone what this album sounds like, but that's what this album does to you. It leaves you at a loss for words over how great it is. You really must hear it for yourself to understand. I could name a bunch of styles of music that it includes, but none would truly descibe or do it justice. If you like Faith No More, Mike Patton, many genres of music, interesting and unique music, or just music in general, buy this album! As for the remastering on this particular version, I think it is great. It is actually a bit quieter than the original, but this is because it is more dynamic and less compressed (if you don't know about compression, it is a technique used that makes the music louder, but also sacrifices more of the dynamic range--contrast between loud and soft parts of the music--the more compressed it is). This allows the listener to hear the album with greater clarity and detail than ever before and to notice elements that may have been missed. Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab makes remasters the way remasters should be made, rather than the common trend of putting out remasters that are simply louder than their older counterparts, but actually less dynamic. It is also on a 24 karat gold compact disc. While it is debatable whether or not that feature accounts for any improvement in sound quality, it does ensure a longer lasting disc that is resistant to oxidation. This version is also of a very limited pressing,as are all MOFI releases and will become a valuable collectible, worth more than the price you paid for it. If you already own and love Angel Dust, I would definitely recommend purchasing this remaster. If you have never heard it, you may want to purchase the regular version, as it is available for only $6.99. However, you will most likely love the album so much that you will want to get this version as well. It's that good.sound quality, it does ensure a longer lasting disc that is resistant to oxidation.

031606792X|1.0|OK. While I did love the first three books realizing this wasn't the best written series ive ever experienced, the last book was a catastrophe of massive proportions. In the first three books, the love story between Bella and Edward kept me yearning to read more wanting to find out if the star-crossed supernatural lovers would have their eternity together. In this book I got a completely detatched plot and a happy ending of sickening proportions!     Bella who from the beginning I found to be a pretty uninteresting, boring, and sulky character also stating a plain and common girl IS apparently the luckiest girl alive... or something Very interesting to everyone else??? Everyone is OBSESSED with this girl and her well-being to the point of disaster and we are all wondering why? Charlie, Edward, Jacob, the entire Cullen Family, boys at school, what is going on here??     Edward and Bella finally get married, go on a honeymoon, with NO details of their impossible night if sex we all waited for other than Edward eats headboards and feather pillows. Bella gets pregnant with a leachy monster fetus lovingly called (little nugder) who Edward wants to abort and have Jacob inpregnate her with a healthy child who wont turn her into the elephant man? WOAHHHH!!!! By this time I knew we were in trouble here. Looks like Edwards old fashion values went bye-bye!     Then came the bloodbath.... Texas Chainsaw massacre style smack dab in the middle of our Romeo and Juliet. First, human Bella drinks blood out of a cup with a straw for the baby. Enjoys it all smiles and thinks it smells good. Then Bella tries to deliver little nugder who they name (Renesmee?) and the blood bath really begins. Jacob is there too to see the love of his life look like the elephant man, naked, throwing up blood and watching edward give her an emergency c-section with his teeth. Ok Carlisle, is there a doctor in the house? Instead of the great moment of intimacy we all hoped for in Edward turing her into a vampire we get this with Edward shooting a syringe full of venom into Bellas heart. Romantic!    So...Bella becomes a beautiful unclumsy vampire with no concequences. Bella gets Edward, Jacob, and Charlie. Special powers, a baby and a cottage in the woods. Stephanie are you Bella maybe??? The Voturi decide they are ok with everything Wow is this conveniant or did the writer get a little lazy. This last installment was so badly written and all over the place. While i did want to see the love that crossed all boundries, I wasnt prepared for this low-bugdet, sci-fi channel night of the living dead! DISSAPOINTED!!!
B001BP4UJA|5.0|Having nothing new to say about such a landmark watershed of an album, I wasn't going to write a review. How can one even put into words the texture and scope of this album; it writhes and coasts through a tunnel of electricity, the signature Motorik beat behind. A longer introduction to Krautrock need not be given. \\"Hallogallo\\" (itself meaning \\"Hallmark\\") encapsulates the sound of Klaus Dinger & Co. with its 4/4 backing rhythm and mellowed synths and guitar dub. This is a ten minute track that is ever growing.<br /><br />\\"Weissensee\\" is a calm, sometimes brooding soundscape, very linear with small psychedelic touches. \\"Im Gluck\\" (\\"Lucky\\") never dreams too much further than its low, ambient drone, from beginning to end it is pulsing. A small swell of guitar is heard and it represents the \\"mu\\", the nothing. But yet, it is something.<br /><br />\\"Negativland\\" is another well known piece, itself giving name to another krautrock influenced group. It plods along with phased guitar lines and a throbbing pulse in its bassline.<br /><br />This album is beyond words, beyond improvisation, beyond thought. It needs to be listened to. It is a timeless work of experimentation inside the Afro-American aesthetic set up by rock music two decades preceding. For ANY fan of classic rock, this is a must hear.
B0001DMPVI|2.0|I guess I should listen to the rest of the album, & compare it to my worn-out LP copy to see if this is better, but...I bought this CD for the bonus tracks...specifically, for the \\"single version\\" of \\"Sky Pilot (pt 1 & 2)\\". The original 45 RPM release was a vastly different mix, with the \\"flanging\\" & echo used sparingly, instead of laid on with a trowel as on the LP version. Also the fade-out between parts 1 & 2 began at the guitar solo. The so-called \\"single version\\" on this CD is just the album track reduced to mono, with all the excess effects, & it doesn't even fade out/in at the correct point. All makes me wish I'd never let go of the 45 I bought back in December '68. I expected that someone would have dug deeper in the archives & remastered the (better) 45 mix to digital

B00006YXOX|4.0|This writer is deeply suspicious of the &#34;boxed set&#34; mentality and boxed sets in general : more often than not, they result in &#34;boxed set performances.&#34;  That is, whether or not a given conductor-and-orchestra truly have an entire &#34;cycle&#34; of works in their bones, nevertheless &#34;The Company (i.e., someone in Sales) wants to put out a complete boxed set; we've got, say,  three more works to go before the cycle is finished;  we have X number of allotted sessions, so let's get THROUGH them shall we.&#34;  Even if the recordings are spread across the years (and often they are not), still, in those conditions sense of occasion, discovery, or &#34;special-ness&#34;  can go to the wall.  (This renders Dorati's Hadyn cycle all the more amazing for being as good as it is.)  To put it another way, Jean Giraudoux once said that &#34;Only the mediocre are always at their best.&#34; And this certainly applies to even the greatest conductors who record &#34;representative,&#34; or even complete, cycles of works...Toscanini was revered as a Brahmsian, but he never quite got the hang of the 3rd Symphony...Kempe's Strauss cycle is essential, but his TOD UND VERKLARUNG, ZARATHUSTRA and HELDENLEBEN are, to put it kindly,  somewhat anemic...Solti's Strauss operas are essential, except for his disastrous ARIADNE, where (for all the world, as if he were conducting TRISTAN) he misses the irony, sense of fantasy and story-within-a-story and burns the music to a crisp...Most of Beecham's Mozart is treasurable, but he never bothered with the 33rd Symphony; his one commercial reading of the 29th has that notoriously slow first movement; and his ultra-slow EINE KLEINE NACHTMUSIK Finale is similarly plagued with an incompatibility with the work's other three movements...And, more to the point of this review, precious few Brucknerian conductors 'get' the 6th Symphony as well as they 'get' the 4th, 5th, and 7th through 9th ; Steinberg,  Klemperer and Horenstein were the shining exceptions...One could go on and on, but you get the idea.  Now, outside of the RING and  J.S. Bach's cyclical masterworks  - such as the liturgically-linked Cantatas of the CHRISTMAS ORATORIO and &#34;treatise&#34; compilations such as THE WELL-TEMEPERED CLAVIER and THE ART OF THE FUGUE -  most great music was not, in fact, composed in, and almost never intended to be performed in, &#34;cycles.&#34;  That being said, boxed sets can be a good, economical way to get to know a series of works - but they should almost never be the last word.  Still, if you MUST have a boxed set of Bruckner's nine &#34;canonic&#34; Symphonies, Jochum's DG box is one of the more reliable ways to go. (Haitink's Philips Concertgebouw cycle is another, but completely different option - see my review.  Strangely enough, in both sets the 8th Symphony is the least successful effort.)  I say &#34;reliable,&#34; because, with something like 50 years of hindsight since this stereo set was completed, it is hard to claim any one of Jochum's  symphonic Bruckner performances  as &#34;definitive&#34; as his way with Bruckner's choral works and Masses  (even if both the 1965 1st Symphony and the earlier 1949 Hamburg 8th - of which, more later -  come fairly close).  These stereo performances are not as spectacularly recorded as HvK's, but Jochum seems to have a better grasp of structure and the inner contemplative core of Bruckner.  Because this was the first widely available, stereo boxed set of Bruckner's First through Ninth, it was perhaps over-praised in its time.  And so to this day, in some Brucknerian quarters, it remains reactionarily fashionable to dump on it.  But even if other viable approaches to Bruckner have become better known, since this set's completion in 1967, it would be gratuitous - and ungrateful - to ignore the treasures herein.  The 1st is stupendous.  Jochum and the Berliners actually make it sound like mature or even mid-point Bruckner.  (Their discreet underlining of thematic links between several passages is one of the ways they accomplish this.)  The nearest competition,  Haitink's 1972 Concertgebouw version, is a bit more incisively played, and more consciously &#34;early-bold&#34;.  (Bruckner himself humorously claimed that the raucous introduction to the fourth movement resembles a loud bumpkin, pushing the door open and announcing &#34;Da bin ich!&#34; - &#34;Here I am!&#34;.) Of course, both approaches are valid, but  yours truly confesses a greater preference for the Concertgebouw performance  Jochum's DG 2nd and 3rd  are superb, if you accept the Novak / 1877 edition of the 2nd, and the Novak / 1889 edition of the 3rd (which this writer - rightly or wrongly -  does not).  In any case, in the 2nd Jochum makes a bit more of the pauses in this &#34;Pausensinfonie,&#34; but never to the point of Melodrama...Haitink goes about those pauses more discreetly, and seems to turn in an even greater performance. The 1877-78 3rd, and the 1889 3rd even more so, may indeed be more concise and &#34;symmetrical&#34; in an almost &#34;Brahmsian&#34; way,  but they have always struck yours truly as a progressive stylistic and structural backpedalling from the craggier, more potent 1873. (About ten years ago, a FANFARE or ARG reviewer,  writing of the 1889 3rd, put it succinctly : &#34;I love Brahms, but I want my Bruckner free of him.&#34;)  Jochum, of course, preferred the 1889, as did Szell and Bohm.  The 5th in this box is the 1958 Bavarian Radio version - possibly Jochum's best. The &#34;extra&#34; brass which Jochum always employed in the Finale, play with far better intonation, here, than in any of Jochum's subsequent 5ths. And the slightly &#34;rustic&#34; feel, which the 1950s Bavarian Radio players imparted to Bruckner, seems to fit the contours of Bruckner's orchestration AND counterpoint miraculously well. (The same is true of their 1955 Bruckner 4th and 1954 9th : no 'allowances' need be made for the quality of their playing.)This 1966 Bavarian Radio 6th strikes yours truly as Jochum's most convincing commercial effort with this quirky masterpiece, although he never had quite as sure a grasp of its &#34;DNA&#34; as he did with the 5th  - and (this is no discredit to Jochum !) not as much as in Steinberg's 1970 Boston 6th.  (The qualifying word &#34;commercial&#34; is used, here, because there IS a live 1980 Jochum 6th with the Concertgebouworkest, which this writer does not yet know.)  Jochum's stereo 1964 Berlin 9th comes across as deeper, more of a &#34;sound-spectacular&#34; and with a more manic energy, than his mono 1954 Bavarian Radio - which, however, to this writer's ears, seems fresher, more structurally balanced, and with even more clarity as to inner melodies and lines.  (The DG-Originals transfer reveals a sonic impact hardly less than the stereo version's.)  Regrettably, in 1964, near the end of the Adagio, Jochum &#34;softens&#34; the famous crunching, dissonant brass chord into a primly conventional diminished-seventh chord. Both recordings are marked as using the Nowak, as opposed to the Haas, edition; so it does not appear to be a textual issue, but one of Jochum later opting for a musical 'fig leaf'.  Nevertheless, Jochum's 1955 Bavarian Radio 4th and 1949 Hamburg 8th  (neither of which are in this box) are more intense and fresher in interpretative impact.  The Bavarian Radio 1955 4th & 1954 9th are in the DG SPRACHE DER WELT series (the 4th only available from amazon.de - that is, the German site). The 1949 Hamburg 8th - Haas edition ! - and the 1954 9th were available in amazingly good sound, on a DG Originals 2-fer, before it was unceremoniously axed.  As with Jochum's 1950s Bavarian Radio Bruckner discs,  no 'allowances' need be made for the Hamburgers' playing.  Never forget that these recordings date from a time when even so-called &#34;second tier&#34; orchestras had their own, inimitable sonic &#34;sheen&#34; - i.e., before the onset of the post-Karajan, post-Jet International Sound.  Jochum's 1952 Berlin 7th, briefly available on Tahra, is also worth finding (and since Tahra has ceased operations, finding it won't be a cakewalk).  This set's 1964 Berlin version (especially in the Adagio) exhibits incredible pianissimo playing, and such a different kind of underlining of themes and counterpoint that, for some first-time listeners,  the 1952 - which seems more vividly clear in melodic and structural outlines - could be the better introduction to the 7th.  In any case, this 1964 7th has its own kind of bedrock integrity and spirit, and it is anything but the &#34;bland stereo remake of a great mono version&#34; which is all too common in 'classical' recordings.  The mono DG 4th and 7th-9th are all worth seeking out,  not only for their greater interpretative freshness but for their greater &#34;flow.&#34;  With some exceptions, Jochum's later Bruckner performances are afflicted with a kind of  &#34;stop-go&#34; choppiness (especially the EMI Dresden Symphonies).  True, the Dresden cycle is indeed inspired and radiates an almost manic energy throughout,  but what spoils most of it (at least, for THIS listener) is the edgily-recorded, intonation-challenged brass.  The fact is, they played better for Rudolf Kempe in their 1970-76 Richard Strauss cycle. (As a brass player, yours truly can take &#34;edge&#34;, and some occasional pitch problems, but not both.)  This is especially noticeable in the Finale of the 5th, where Jochum - per his usual custom - reinforces the existing brass with &#34;extras&#34; which, to this writer's ears, play excrementally.  A Bruckner  / Jochum enthusiast will need to supplement this box with the earlier 4th and 7th through 9th. But this box is still a  spiritual treasure chest : do not hesitate.
B001993Y2C|1.0|I really enjoyed the series.  BUT, how can anyone rate a product that hasn't been released and doesn't tell you what you're getting? The advertised run time is only 180 minutes.  That's 3 hours.  I certainly hope it's a typo.  if it includes all 4 seasons and the movies, then it's worth it.  Otherwise, it's hard to tell what they will give you.  Remember what they did to us for season 2 and season 4?  I won't consider this product until they list what's really included.  Besides, is it just me, or has the cost of Blu-Ray movies  jumped up about $5 this past year (about 30%!)?  Somebody is getting awfully greedy out there ... and corporate greed is why our economy is nearly collapsing.

B001DCQI8W|5.0|This is the budget re-release of the greatest set of the complete Bruckner symphonies ever recorded.  I paid more than twice this amount when I purchased the set back in the early 1990s, but even at that it has been worth every penny.  If you are interested in a complete Bruckner set, do yourself a favor and without hesitation throw this into your shopping cart ASAP.<br /><br />I have posted an earlier review of the original set, but to summarize, Karajan is the greatest Bruckner conductor of all time, to my ears.  I am in total awe of what Karajan achieved with this set, and I can't think of any other recorded legacy that is more important.  Every single symphony except for #1 receives a compelling performance, and symphonies 2,4,5,6,7,8, and 9 receive *exceptional* performances (#3 is a fine enough performance, but Karajan uses the highly edited 3rd version, and I prefer the unedited first version in Tintner's exceptional recording).  Karajan's interpretations are magnificent and go right to the soul of this deeply moving music (and without disruptive eccentricities).  And the playing of the Berlin Philharmonic has to be heard to be believed--the balance, the tone, the beautiful sonorities--it's hard to not think that this represents their finest hour(s), so to speak.  The Berlin Philharmonic's playing in this set is the greatest orchestral playing I have ever heard--in any works.  What an achievement for Karajan and the orchestra, and what a great gift to all of us, to have this amazing set that goes right to the soul of this deeply moving music.<br /><br />There are some criticisms of the sound, mostly justified (except for #5 and #9, whose sound I would not touch).  The good news is that because the performances are so compelling and the orchestral playing so stunning, not only does your ear quickly adjust, but before long you are never even questioning that the sound is an issue.  Would this set have benefited from a remastering?  Without doubt.  Will the sound as it is prevent you from treasuring these recordings?  Absolutely not.<br /><br />In the end, the final bow must go to the master, Anton Bruckner.  It is almost inconceivable to me that any human being could have conceived of, let alone successfully executed, the creative ideas that Bruckner puts forward and then successfully resolves in his symphonies (particularly #2,4,5,7, and 9).  Hans-Hubert Schonzeler said it better than anyone ever will:  \\"Bruckner's symphonies are in reality one gigantic arch which starts on Earth amidst suffering humanity, travels up to the Heavens to the very throne of grace, and returns with a message of peace.\\"<br /><br />I hope this music provides you comfort, wisdom, beauty, and joy, as it has me.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|\\"Jaws\\" was really the first Hollywood film that started the tradition of Hollywood releasing blockbuster movies during the summer. The film, as many know, is about a great white shark terrorizing a seaside community in Cape Cod, and its up to the police chief, Sheriff Brody, played by Roy Scheider, to stop the killings and destroy the shark.<br /> I first saw this movie on television in the late '70s, and it terrified me to the point of not be able to sleep for nights, so I wouldn't recommend it to children under 12 because the film is extremely graphic for its time. It is however an excellent film in the horror genre.<br /> Steven Speilberg had his first hit as a director of this film, and it would be his work on \\"Jaws\\" that brought him to the attention of other movie studios. The haunting theme music, composed by John Willimas, still remains the most chilling movie theme in history, and it won Williams an Oscar for Best Original Music for a film.<br /> \\"Jaws\\" is also one of those rare Hollywood films that made the cover of \\"Time\\" magazine in 1975. It became a worldwide phenomenon and made millions at the boxoffice. It stayed in the Top 10 of the highest making films until 1997, when \\"Titanic\\" became the biggest grosser.<br /> There have been many sequels to this blockbuster, but only one is worth watching and buying: \\"Jaws 2\\", released in 1978. Nowhere near as great as the original, \\"Jaws 2\\" is a worthy sequel, also starring Scheider. Forget about all the other \\"Jaws\\" films out there: they are cheaply produced and horribly written and directed.<br /> This DVD comes with a ton of bonuses, but the jewel here is the documentary on the film, with neat info and great anecdotes.
1606800019|5.0|In this 1910 story of Edwardian England, Forster illustrates the conflicts between the superior attitudes of the aristocracy and a developing feeling of obligation toward the \\"lower\\" classes which World War I will soon bring into sharp relief. Margaret and Helen Schlegel are intellectual and sensitive to the arts, with compassionate hearts for those less fortunate.<br /><br />When Margaret, at age twenty-nine, is affianced to Henry Wilcox, the much older, widowed husband of a friend, this conflict of attitudes is brought to the fore. Henry, insensitive and believing himself actually entitled to his family's privileges, is cold and reserved, though Margaret believes that \\"Henry must be forgiven and made better by love.\\"<br /><br />Helen, her sister, a 21-year-old with an enthusiasm for the life of the imagination, has no sympathy for Henry's failure to pay attention to the people \\"below him\\" who are dependent upon his whims. Eventually, a casual remark by Henry leads to the loss of a job for Leonard Bast, a penniless young clerk, but Henry refuses to accept any responsibility whatsoever and refuses his wife's entreaties to give the destitute Leonard a job.<br /><br />Immensely sympathetic to the economic position of the poor and women, Forster illustrates their financial dependence on others. Margaret, who secures the reader's total sympathy, is charged with educating a close-minded dolt like Henry to be kinder and more empathetic towards the people he considers below him, but she achieves only limited success.<br /><br />Filled with incisive observations and great wit, the novel follows the narrative pattern of a melodrama, but Forster's sensitivity to both sides--the practical and conservative values of Henry vs. the emotional and idealistic sides of Margaret and Helen--elevates the novel above the tawdry. Henry is a product of his time and his class, but though times are changing, he is too dense to realize it. The Wilcox home at Howard's End is a microcosm, and its conflicts are those of the nation at that time. Thoughtful and entertaining, Howard's End still draws in readers after almost a hundred years.

1933492279|4.0|7 years into pursuing my craft I generally don't buy books by other artists. It's mainly so that my work won't be influenced by anyone else, but when I came across Daniel Simon's work and website, my jaw dropped. Yep, anyone can be an automotive designer, but Daniel does it with style and attitude. This is one of those books that you don't want to end. It doesn't really have any wire or clay renders, but then would you want your work to look like someone else's? His work is tight. This is not a \\"How-to\\" book, but more like a \\"This is my stuff...\\" And I'm fine with that. It's transportation design at it's extreme. I hope we see a part 2. Great job Daniel.
B001IBIQU6|1.0|I am SO disappointed.    Depeche Mode has been one if not the favorite band of mine for over 20 years now.  After how awesome the last album was, including the song Martyr which was held off the album and put on the Best Of album later, I was expecting so much more from this CD.  Heck, I really like the first single, Wrong, and had hoped that it was a good sign.  It wasn't.    Like Exciter, the first single is the best song from the album.  There are a couple other songs from Exciter that some people like, but after listening to it a few times, I pretty much gave up on it.  This one...I listened to it once and that may be it....and Wrong might be the only good song on it (which is mostly how I felt about Dream On from Exciter.)  I dunno, maybe I'll try and revisit it at some point, but it made such a poor impact, that I really know if or when I will give it another listen.    Wrong is really the only \\"up tempo\\" song.  All the rest are mid-tempo and are VERY melodramatic.  Words are dragged out to where one syllable words now have 3 syllables.  Also, Martin sings under Dave on most of the songs, but rather than being harmonic, it's like a bad echo.  Martin went out and bought a bunch of old late 70s and early 80s synthesizers, and that's where the name of the album came from...the sounds that they made.  He should have focused more on the song crafting than the retro synths.  They not only made the album sound retro, they made it sound cheap.  There were synth pop albums in the 80s that sounded more modern and polished than this.    The lyrics are mostly bad, and the arrangements are poor.  They needed a better album producer...which is odd since it's the same guy who produced the last album.  I wish they'd hire Alan Wilder (who used to be in the band) to produce.  I hear they are still friendly.  He'd have fixed this album, that's for sure.  He'd probably have had Martin go back and write some better songs...and told Dave to do the same thing.    To make it worse, Ibought the \\"Special Edition\\" that comes with the DVD (but since I haven't watched it yet, my review is just for the CD and that's why it's here and not with the CD + DVD set.)  I figured, why not, I have all of their stuff and it could be interesting some of the additional materials.  The album was so disappointing, that I probably won't even get around to watching any of the stuff on the DVD until the Holidays.  Also, it just about sucked any desire I have to spend all that time and money to go see them on tour (their closest stop for me is Lollapalooza.)     My cousin, also a huge DM fan, called me to ask my opinion, and after I told her how much I disliked it, she decided to not buy it yet, but give my CD a listen for herself first.    All in all, I am very disappointed.
B000002KHB|5.0|Deep Purple was an English band, known as much for the technical expertise as their sheer volume.  Singer Ian Gillam shows amazing ability to hit clear high notes, and was also selected as the lead for the \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" album.  His screams on \\"Highway Star\\" are unbelievable, as are organist Jon Lord's Hammond runs, Ian Pace's thunderous drumming and Ritchie Blackmore's shredding leads.  \\"Smoke On the Water\\", the classic hard rock anthem, first appeared on this disk, but \\"Lazy\\", \\"Maybe I'm a Leo\\", \\"Pictures Of Home\\", and \\"Never Before\\" are also great cuts that were overshadowed by the hits that received radio airplay.  The closing cut, \\"Space Trucking\\" has even higher, more urgent, vocal screams near the end, which are the perfect dynamic conclusion to another racing heavy metal standard.  This is one of the definitive hard rock albums, a must own for every collection.

B000000XB9|5.0|This is a single disk that accurately captures one of the great American groups of the time.  Creedence Clearwater Revival was born in California, but managed to grab a taste of Southern culture through the songwriting and playing of front man, John Fogerty.  The original tunes tell tales of riverboats in the South, Tin Pan Alley, washboards and hand clapping tales, as well as serious political commentary, like \\"Fortunate Son\\".  The hits are amazing, from the earliest cover of Dale Hawkins' \\"Suzie Q\\", through the Screaming Jay Hawkins song, \\"I Put a Spell On You\\", where Fogerty wails like a man possessed.  \\"Looking Out My Back Door\\" is a humerous tale fueled by imagination.  \\"Down On the Corner\\" is story about four guys on the corner singing harmonies for the sheer love of it.  \\"Bad Moon Rising\\", an ominous tale of forboding has a chugging guitar that supplies rhythmic fill.  \\"Up Around the Bend\\" begins with a searing guitar riff that flies into a powerful song.  There is a second disk that is a good companion greatest hits, and a great box set that is more comprehensive, but this one of the best and most affordable \\"Greatest Hits\\" collections you can get.

0143036556|2.0|I enjoyed Jared Diamond's book when I first read it, but am nevertheless astonished that he fails to mention the probable cause of the impending collapse of our own society - 'peak oil' or the peaking of world oil 'production'.     Industrial society depends on fossil fuel for everything that we eat, move, and make, yet the fact that this once-only gift from nature is finite seems to have been ignored. There is now increasing evidence that we are within a few years of peak oil - yet our politicians, CEOs, Wall Street and the media are seemingly blind to this fact.     In 2005 the Hirsch Report, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy, was published. It made the point that mitigation of the effects of peak oil would require action on a massive scale 20 years before peak. One would have thought that this would have galvanised governments to action, but those in a position to initiate the urgent action needed remain wilfully blind.     One would hope that part of Diamond's reason for writing the book was to help to avoid repeating one of the cardinal mistakes of other societies, over-exploitation and depletion of the resource base. It appears that even Diamond has failed to learn this lesson.     History may not exactly repeat itself, but it certainly rhymes.
B001G0MFOM|5.0|I was really intrigued by the story line and for the idea that Jenny gets killed off. She was a girl from the mid west, come out to the west to venture a new life with her boyfriend, fiancee, ex husband then to have realized her sexuality isn't what she had thought because of her misconstrued nature of life.  she was an excellent character, and she acted very well, she was the one character that i just wanted to pull her hair off, not just chop it off.   I loved the story line with Bette and Tina, and i'm glad to see them back together again.  Shane wished she had Carmen come back into her life, but instead went crazy for Jenny.  Alice should not have shared her idea with Jenny, already knowing how caniving and devious Jenny is.  But there is, and always will be a character you will have to base who is the good guy, and who is the bad guy in order to know the difference between the two. Tasha is excellent.  I don't know what's running through Max's head.  Helena, i despise that she wanted to return to Danny's girlfriend. Boo on that part.  Overall story line, honestly with the time that was permitted, the budget they were limited, was very excellent, only because they had intended to have a spin-off. Which i do hope the spinoff makes it to television, and not just online.   The L word was and is, always going to be a monumental historical epic for lesbians and bisexuals and transexuals in televison entertainment. I heart the L word!!!
B001UAVNVO|5.0|I am a new convert to the Lamb of God Experience. I have been hearing enough of the new album on XM and musically they have come miles from their older albums of beating fast on drums and screaming.  Randy Blyth still takes some time to get used to, but the background music is straight up metal in you face.  Catchy grooves and grinds that get your blood pumping. For me, this version of 2cd's, 2 lp's, and the 500mg USB drive was the perfect choice. Like the deluxe edition, this has the bonus disc of the tracks broken down into drum, bass, vocal, and guitar, so I can filter out the vocals if I want to.  I really think the USB drive is worth the price I got this for (on sale during new release week), because it has the whole album+2 bonus tracks, and all the songs (including the bonus tracks) broken into the 4 parts. The USB is black and silver with the Lamb of God logo on it.  I just put it right on my phone and mp3 player and off I went.  And what can I say, having a vinyl copy is the icing on the cake.  Take a look at this in stores and online.
B000TGCR38|3.0|To begin with, I did enjoy watching this movie, but there were quite a few issues.    The main issue is that you just don't care: you don't care when anyone gets killed, you don't care when Tim is tortured (by the way, he did NOT start bickering with Franken; and his shirt must have had at least one tiny speck of dust on it), you don't care when Rachel/Ellis is being humiliated, you don't care when her family and friends are gunned down.    The only character I cared about remotely was Theo, and I loved his scene when he shot Van Gein. Johnny de Mol was great in that.    The next issue is that I can pretty well guarantee that this movie would not have been made, say, 20 years after the war. The whole \\"nice Nazi officer\\" concept would have been ridiculed in the Netherlands, let alone a big romance between a Gestapo highup officer and a Jewess. It's a fantasy, and a badly done one --- Rachel/Ellis must have a stomach of steel: you could skin a live puppy in front of that woman and she wouldn't move. I don't know if this was intentional or just lousy acting, but it kind of detracted.    The next issue is that none of it really made any sense, and sometimes it just went too far: I mean there is NO WAY she got that painting back up on the wall before Müntze walked in. The movie was full of problems like that.    The torture was minimal --- the scene lasted less than 2 minutes. In certain scenes, there really wasn't enough blood (really, if you kill a guy via firing squad, there is going to be blood). It also was annoying that you already knew that Ellis/Rachel was going to survive it all, and that the whole movie was basically all a flashback --- any suspense that the movie might have had was defused completely.    I did enjoy watching the movie, but it was definitely below my expectations.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I have to admit that I have never been a huge fan of Depeche Mode when it comes to listen to their whole albums. For example, \\"Playing the angel\\" (2005) was good enough for me just at its half and the same happened with \\"exciter\\" (2002) and even \\"ultra\\" (1997). But \\"Sounds of the universe\\" finds the band at its peak. Every single song has something to offer and something to be remembered by. I would even say that \\"Wrong\\" (which I love BTW) it's one of the weakest songs of the album. My personal favorites are \\"In chains\\" (this sounds a la Depeche in the 90's), \\"Fragile tension\\" (a brilliant song in every way you see it...love the singing from David Gahan and the guitar parts that Martin Gore nailed here), \\"Peace\\" (this one does sounds like the universe...amazing) and \\"miles away/the truth is\\" (another classic from DM that will be a single in a near future and will be must-song to remember Depeche Mode). Get the album and enjoy the ride with Depeche Mode when they take you to space to listen the sounds of the universe.
031606792X|5.0|As a very ancient lady, I have compared Twilight to eating cheezies, although as the bookstore lady said, the books are much healthier than the bright orange things.  Stephenie Meyer is a great storyteller, and that is a rare thing.  She makes you want to know, \\"what happens next.\\"  And the last book ties everything up neatly, so all we can do is go back to the beginning and start over.    I found \\"Midnight Sun\\" (on her site) very illuminating:  our Edward the Vampire is a dork.  He is a virginal type who is in the throes of his first love... as is Bella, so he makes many of the mistakes made by a dorky first lover, all complicated by the vampire-human thing of course.  It is charming and, as the story unwinds, dreadful, when it becomes clear that this First Love is the Only Love for the two young people.  Thus we are in the death scenes of Romeo and Juliet, and all the darkness of Heathcliffe and Catherine.  (I admit, I have totally avoided the beginning half of New Moon)      However, the movie and its upcoming sequals are complicating matters for Twilight book fans.  This is a good thing for the actors as they will be able to eat regularly for the foreseeable.  However,  the sensual aura around all of them, and particularly around Robert Pattinson, is quite different from the book itself.  As the latter has (somewhere) said, many people (like moi) have noted the abstinence/true love/ innocence ethos in the book, but HE comes across 10 year old girls who announce to him that they would like to have his baby;  and then there is the whole biting thing from the more frantic fans.  Eventually, I believe that especially the male actors might want to have a chat with Colin Firth, who has dragged around the Darcy persona like Marley's ghost for some 20 years now.      To be optimistic, I foresee that, because of \\"Twilight\\", lot of young people will read Wuthering Heights, Pride and Prejudice and Anne of Green Gables, and finding great joy in doing so.      Congratulations to all of you, then, especially Stephenie Meyers... who has an accountant for a husband, lucky woman!
B001TOD92C|4.0|For starters, if for no other reason at all, watch this movie for the performance by Mickey Rourke.  This is one of the deepest and overwhelming/powerful performances you will ever see.  In a one hour and forty five minute span, Rourke makes you like him, hate him, feel sorry for/pity him and possibly even cry for him..it is simply one of the best performances I have ever seen.<br /><br />I have not seen 'Milk' but am looking forward to watching it.  I hate to say this without seeing the performance by Sean Penn, but I can't possibly imagine it is even a quarter of what Rourke pulled off, here.  Everyone knows the Academy and the Hollywood Liberals, in general, are going to give the nod to a peer who plays a physically/mentally handicapped person or a character who is of the non-traditional sexual orientation.  Those are just the facts...you add the fact Rourke is not a mainstream type of personality who intentionally tries to speak out against global issues as if he was the Dalai Lama of humanitarianism, and Sir Mick really had no shot....it's a crying shame (but again, I look forward to seeing Penn's performance).<br /><br />To boot, 'The Wrestler' is a very good movie.  Of course, Rourke's performance has a lot to do with that, but this movie proves that pretty depressing subject matter can make for an extremely entertaining film when there are actual layers to the story (not the artsy films where it's Joe Miserable sitting around feeling sorry for himself).<br /><br />In a nutshell, Randy Robinson is at the end of a successful wrestling career.  He's still hanging on and performs in smaller vanues along the east coast.  His lifetime of prescription drug abuse, steroid/HGH use and the sheer pounding his body has endured over a 20/25 year span has caused severe physical, mental  and emotional damage.  'The Wrestler' is essentially this character study as he tries to hang on, give up, reconcile, find companionship, and figure out what it means to try and lead a \\"normal\\" life when he realizes that there has to be a life after the ring at some point.<br /><br />I'm sure there are millions of people out there whose careers are much closer to the end than to the beginning and wonder just how in the hell they're going to survive outside of a lifestyle they've lived and loved for so long, but their bodies and minds just can't allow them to do it anymore.  Can they survive?<br /><br />Darren Aronofsky made a terrific movie.  I'd give it four and a half stars if they allowed you to add a fraction in here.  It's very well made and paced perfectly...and I couldn't have asked for a better ending.<br /><br />A movie like this gives me hope for movie making, because it's been really, really lousy lately (I hope they don't remake this in 20 years).zes that there has to be a life after the ring at some point.

If you are a big medieval and action fan, you will like this, but it is depressing.

630522885X|5.0|\\"Lola Montes\\", the last movie from French director Max Ophuls, is about a courtesan's colorful but tragic life. The fact that she is displayed and marketed in the circus shows society's contempt for her lifestyle. The movie is colorful and the sweeping camera view is a sight to behold. It reminds me of a novel by Kafka, about some people being displayed at the zoo, and others go there to see them. She is at once celebrated and degraded at the circus, but definitely more humiliated. I don't know if it is the best movie, \\"Casablanca\\", \\"Citizen Kane\\" probably are winning that race. But it is a very fascinating movie. Maybe we  are all displayed in the circus like Lola Montes, we just don't know about it. Highly recommended to all.
B001TCAT9U|5.0|I never write reviews on anything, but I felt obligated to tell everybody that this is one of the albums, which sounds very dull in mp3 format, no matter what bitrate. It came as a huge surprise to me, but when I listened to 320k mp3 version of this album, I totally hated it. But when I listened to either CD version or DTS version on DVD, I simply loved it. This comes from a long time Depeche Mode fan. On mp3 I can hardly hear some of the instruments. DM is also using an interesting combination of high and low frequency sounds, which are very clear on CD, but aren't defined well in mp3. Long story short - try a non-compressed version of this album before you make your opinion about it. There are still issues with oversimplified lyrics and lack of a common style in the album, but the sound will win you over.
0446402397|1.0|ye gods, what a silly book! Every detail is so flatly one-dimensional that the book reads like a smoothly written cartoon. I could see that this story was based on the bare fact of the existence of the Russian serial killer Chikitilo, but that merely supplies the plot point. There seemed to be no first-hand knowledge of life in the Soviet police state. Each poor citizen was an automaton wound up to run at maximum paranoia & all people are set against one another, to the point of uniformly being willing to turn in others for ideology or profit. In the midst of this hell on earth, a love story grows between those whose eyes have opened (or were always opened). No person's character is plausibly developed, male characters are linked by love or buried desire, and the story falls apart into a painfully absurd, hackneyed solution.   The book seems to stitch together political anti-communist tracts, movies, and thrillers (Hitchcock did it so much better!) with detective novels and paranoid fiction of every sort. Slick writing à la TV plots, a lack of concern for human beings, and voilà: a novel.   There is neither social reality nor social redemption in this shallow book.

0446402397|1.0|This book is seriously flawed and if it were not for its stale anti-Russian propaganda it would probably go unnoticed.  Your time and money would be much better spent reading George Orwell's \\"1984\\", which paints an excellent picture of the potential danger of the absolute power of a totalitarian state.  The characters of Child 44 fall apart in the middle of the book and their escapes from danger are ridiculously unbelievable.  For instance the main character Leo kills a villain with a telephone cord and then just a few pages later a switchblade knife suddenly appears from nowhere in Leo's possession, which he uses to pick a lock.  If Leo had a switchblade knife wouldn't that be the weapon of choice for killing instead of a telephone cord?  Just as mysteriously, the switchblade knife disappears and is never mentioned again.  A little later in the book a peasant gives Leo a kitchen knife for self-defense.  The end seems rushed to meet a deadline and to wrap it up with a happy ending.  Very sloppy, only worthy for beach reading.
0374139563|2.0|This brief book has received a lot of attention since it was published just a few months ago earlier this year. The author attacks development aid to Africa with a vengeance, calling it the \\"silent killer of growth.\\"  Despite the billions of dollars worth of development aid to Africa provided by Western governments over the past four decades, poverty and inequality have in fact increased on the continent. This is not the first book to criticize aid, but the fact that the author is an African woman (instead of the usual white males) has struck a chord with many reviewers and the audience. Dambisa Moyo is livid about what she sees as not only wasted money but as an active hindrance to economic development. All the well-meaning but naïve celebrities campaigning for more aid to Africa get an earful from Dr. Moyo, an academic economist who has made her career in the financial sector in the West.<br /><br />Moyo states the goal of the book in the Introduction: \\"This book is about the aid-free solution to development: why it is right, why it has worked, why it is the only way forward for the world's poorest countries\\" (p. xx). The book is divided into two parts. The first third, `The World of Aid,' provides an history and critique of development aid to Africa and more broadly. Unfortunately, her training in economics--and this being her first book to a general audience--comes through as overuse of numbers and statistics, resulting in numbing and sometimes impenetrable sentences:<br /><br />\\"Local debt returned investors 15 per cent in 2006, and 18 per cent in 2007. In the last five years average African credit spreads have collapsed by 250 basis points. What this means is that if a country issues US$100 million in debt, it is saving itself US$2.5 million per year relative to where it was five years ago.\\" (p. 4)<br /><br />\\"Among the top five aid recipients from the Marshall Plan were Great Britain, which received the lion's share of 24 percent, and France, Italy and Germany, which receive 20, 11 and 10 per cent, respectively. In per capita terms smaller European countries received more support: Norway received US$136 per person, Austria US$131, Greece US$128 and the Netherlands US$111.\\" (p. 12)<br /><br />Also her indignation about aid is so rabid that her writing often turns to hyperbole or in other places is painfully simplified:<br /><br />\\"This is the vicious cycle of aid. The cycle that chokes off desperately needed investment, instils a culture of dependency, and facilitates rampant and systematic corruption, all with deleterious consequences for growth. The cycle that, in fact, perpetuates underdevelopment, and guarantees economic failure in the poorest aid-dependent countries.\\" (p. 49)<br /><br />\\"In an aid-dependent environment, the talented--the better-educated and more-principled, who should be building the foundations of economic prosperity--become unprincipled and are drawn from productive work towards nefarious activities that undermine the country's growth prospects.\\" (p. 50)<br /><br />All of this makes especially the first part of the book rather tedious. She definitely is no match to more established aid critics, such as New York University professor and former World Banker Bill Easterly whose books The Elusive Quest for Growth and The White Man's Burden make for thoughtful and entertaining reading.<br /><br />The second part, `A World without Aid,' luckily lifts the book to a higher level, as Ms. Moyo focuses on the positive rather than bashing what she sees as a crime against Africa. She definitely does not lack in ambition, stating that:<br /><br />\\"This book provides a blueprint, a road map, for Africa to wean itself off aid. ...  What follows is a menu of alternatives to fund economic development across poor countries. If implemented in the most efficient way, each of these solutions will help to dramatically reduce Africa's dependency on aid.\\" (p. 75) and \\"The Dead Aid proposal envisages a gradual (but uncompromising) reduction in systematic aid over a five- to ten-year period.\\" (p. 76)<br /><br />Here she launches her `Dead Aid strategies' that, \\"if embraced wholeheartedly, will not only turn the economic tide in the short term, but also promise longer-term growth\\" (p. 143). Her blueprint for indigenous economic development in Africa focuses on a set of solutions, notably the development of capital markets, foreign direct investment, trade, and various forms of microfinance. She does also recognize the role of remittances from the overseas diaspora that are so important to many developing countries. Although the remittances are a type of aid--an influx of unearned money into the country from abroad--Ms. Moyo believes this to be less harmful than government to government aid.<br /><br />Although the solutions presented are basically free-market oriented, the author is principally concerned about how to finance development, rather than the development model itself. She even suggests that it matters little whether the country in question has a capitalist or socialist development strategy. Quoting the Scandinavian experience, she recognizes that governments can raise money on the free markets while using it on a \\"socialist agenda\\" of free education and health care (pp. 72-73). In fact, she considers that for such governments using free-market tools to finance development is particularly important.<br /><br />Furthermore, despite her call for \\"uncompromising\\" reduction of aid, she shows certain flexibility in allowing that \\"more-modest aid programmes that are actually designed to address the critical problems faced by African countries can deliver some economic value\\" may have some room to be part of Africa's development financing strategy (p. 76).<br /><br />And all of her ire is not directed towards aid and the Western nations that provide it, more for their own interest than in Africa's, in her opinion. She frequently chastises African policymakers for corruption and red tape, reminding us that it is not accidental that FDI avoids Africa.<br /><br />Dambisa Moyo dedicates an entire chapter, entitled `The Chinese are Our Friends,' to the role of China in Africa. With poorly disguised excitement she describes China's rapidly emerging engagement on the continent and goes as far as claiming that \\"in the last sixty years, no country has made as big an impact on the political, economic and social fabric of Africa as China has since the turn of the millennium\\" (p. 103). She is particularly enthusiastic about the fact that the Chinese involvement is all for commercial purposes--whether FDI or trade--unlike that of the West, which has for long given Africa \\"something for nothing.\\" In earlier parts of the book she has fashioned China and other East Asian countries that have developed through their own efforts as role models for Africa. She is well aware of the risks of the relationship with China: that the Chinese companies might underbid local firms or would not hire Africans or that they would have lax safety standards--all the standard issues that worry concerned Westerners when they think of China's growing influence in Africa. However, Moyo correctly points out that, while Westerners are outraged by Chinese support for Africa's corrupt and rogue leaders, these same \\"notorious plunderers and despots\\" have risen and thrived \\"under the auspices of Western aid, goodwill and transparency\\" (p. 108). Furthermore, to her, the pros of Chinese involvement far outweigh the cons:<br /><br />\\"Bartering infrastructure for energy reserves is well understood by the Chinese and Africans alike. It's a trade-off, and there are no illusions as to who does what, to whom and why...To continue to grow at its extraordinarily rapid rate China needs fuel, and Africa has it. But for Africa it's about survival. In the immediate term, Africa is getting what it needs--quality capital that actually funds investment, jobs for its people and that elusive growth. Theseare the things that aid promised, but has consistently failed to deliver.\\" (p. 111)<br /><br />In the case of trade, Dambisa Moyo is equally harsh on the West as on Africa itself. She rightly reminds us the \\"elected Western politicians have remained keen to protect their agricultural markets, and win the backing of the powerful farming lobby. The net result is a protective world of trade restrictions and barriers up around the West, to keep African (and other developing regions') produce out\\" (p. 115). Yet at the same time she finds that the \\"most egregious examples come from Africa itself. African countries impose an average tariff of 34 per cent on agricultural products from other African nations, and 21 per cent on their own products\\" (p. 117).<br /><br />Regretfully, the many good points that Moyo raises are again undermined by her style. The text is littered with cringe-inducing similes (\\"seduced by the siren call of aid, African governments sink their ships on the rocks of development demise\\" - p. 88). And in her fervour she again resorts to hyperbole:<br /><br />\\"The West can choose to ignore all of this, but, like it or not, the Chinese are coming. And it is in Africa that their campaign for global dominance will be solidified. Economics comes first, and when they own the banks, the land and the resources across Africa, their crusade will be over. They will have won.\\" (p. 152)<br /><br />Quite unnecessarily, in an apparent attempt to liven up the discussion, she invents and uses a fictitious country, the Republic of Dongo, as a dummy against which she places her proposals. Dongo is supposedly some sort of hybrid displaying many of the characteristics of various African countries. However, the decoy adds little more than an additional irritant to the book.<br /><br />All in all, I read 'Dead Aid' with mixed feelings. Early on, the angry prose and doctrinaire perspective really got to me. Having worked for most of my adult life on international development issues (unlike Dr. Moyo), I was also taken aback by the wholesale dismissal of virtually all development cooperation. Then later when focusing on the alternatives to aid, the book significantly lightened up and the solutions that were proposed started to be much more convincing. There is no denying that the East Asian countries, like China, Korea and Singapore, all experienced rapid development that was not based on aid, at least over an extended period. Surely there are lessons for Africa to be learned there. How countries develop is not straightforward or simple. Each place has its own dynamics and idiosyncrasies to which complex geographical, historical, political and economic factors contribute (see for example Paul Collier's recent book 'The Bottom Billion').

0198534469|5.0|Warning!  This book is NOT meant to be a rigorous, traditional math text.  I don't believe Needham made any claims that the material he is writing is meant to be.  That's why he footnotes all of his \\"claims\\" and encourages the reader to go deeper into subjects if need be.  If your sole purpose is to find a textbook on complex analysis, this is NOT the book for you.  That said, this book did more to help me UNDERSTAND complex numbers, beyond equations and proofs, than any other text.  He addresses math the way someone who thinks visually needs him to.  (This is an issue I have taken with American mathematics pedagogy in general.  Not everyone \\"gets\\" math via algebra and symbology alone.  Some of us need pictures, analogies, etc. to figure out whats going on.)  Before any mathematicians take exception to this, remember that Einstein developed special relativity using thought experiments that relied heavily on visualizations.  In any case, this books treatment of how complex numbers resolved third order polynomial solutions and why they are necessary for the fundamental theorem of algebra ALONE warrants praise.  And presenting the history of the development of any mathematical (or scientific idea) is an excellent way to help students model their own thought processes.  When you can see where the roadblocks were for others and how they were resolved, it becomes easier for you to do the same.    Yes, buy Lars Ahlfors, Churchill and Brown, etc. but keep this book handy to really open your eyes.

B001TOD92C|4.0|I was very curious to see this movie.  I heard an interview with Mickey Rourke on Howard Stern, and I was intrigued with Rourke's love for the part and his work on the movie.  This movie chronicles the fall of a once famous professional wrestler Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson through ups and downs, injuries and victories, steroid abuse and drug abuse, sex and rock and roll.<br /><br />Let's be clear on what this movie is right up front.  This is a tragedy.  It has elements of a documentary in that it follows Rourke's character closely,so closely in fact that the pace drags at times.  However, the feeling of being behind the scenes of the wrestling world sparks the curiosity that overpowers the boredom for the most part.<br /><br />The insight one gets on the world of wrestling is very interesting.  There is a counter culture there that many of us are not exposed.  The steroids, pain killers, growth hormones, tanning, medical treatment and all of the injuries that go along with the world of wrestling.  Much of this is taken for granted by the average fan.  I know I didn't even consider or think of this when I was a fan of wrestling as a preteen.<br /><br />The message in this movie is very clear.  Many sacrifices have to be made to pursue your dreams, and sometimes those sacrifices are more than we can bear.  To be truly successful, one must remember to keep those sacrifices in mind and choose wisely.  In this movie the character of The Ram chose wrestling over his family, and he even sacrifices his body and long term health for immediate satisfaction and justification of pursuing wrestling.  Hence the tragedy that ends for The Ram on a high point...literally when he climbs to the top rope to finish off his opponent while having his second heart attack and probably his final blow.
B000UX6TRK|5.0|I thought the concept of the show was outstanding. A lot of energy at the right time and an ease into performing the ballads that did not bog down the show. Glad he did not have recorded tracks. Live should mean mean live! The crowd was into it.  I would love to see him live now because I know he can still perform and sing good enough to put on a good show. We need more real music not this jump around the stage with recorded music crap these kids today pass off as show business. This show should go to Vegas and add the old commodores to it in spots! I would surely go see it.
B000GFLAI0|2.0|I'm a HUGE Dylan fan and really just don't get this and all the hype. \\"Time out of Mind\\" was a mood, songs were generally good...same with \\"Love and Theft\\". On Modern Times it just seems that there are re-worked blues songs. Bob Dylan KNOWS what he's doing...he has songcraft ability. He can do much better. He can even sing much better...he just doesn't choose to. Dylan himself said never to give the public your full 100% effort. On this album he's giving about 25%. Of course, I bought the deluxe edition....that just means he has my ear (and my wallet). Honestly it just isn't that great.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Boy oh BOY. I saw all the originals on TV. i didnt see any extended versions or anything like that. I was happy just to watch them on TV. I never heard such a bratty Audieance in my life over Star trek. I saw the theater motion picture along time ago and I LOVED EVERY SEC OF IT!!!! this will be alot cheaper than the other version anyways so i will buy it NOW!!!
0553582038|2.0|I LOVED the first 3 books in A Song of Ice and Fire.  Like many readers of this series my favorite characters are Jon Snow, Daenyrs, and Tyrion.  The problem is they are not in this book.  After dedicating 3 volumes and 3,500 pages to create some of the most fully realized and entertaining characters in the fantasy genre, George RR Martin inexplicably decides to omit them from this story and subject us (ad nauseum) to  Brienne, the swordwench of Tarth.      Now my complaint about Brienne isn't that she is ugly (although she is) or stupid (she is); the problem is that she is NOT INTERESTING.   Her multiple chapters do not advance the larger story one iota.     She is searching for Sansa but since we have known Sansa's location since the conclusion of \\"A Storm of Swords\\" there is no suspense.  Becuase Brienne is utterly grim and without humor you'd think Martin would at least pair her up with some interesting and witty travel companions.  Nope -- Brienne, Poderick and the Sept stumble about aimlessly (and humorlessly) chapter after chapter.  Brienne is the Jar Jar Binks of ASOIAF.      When I was a little kid I went to see a Lakers exhibition game.  Magic, Kareem and James Worthy played for about 3 minutes combined.  The game was unmemorable except as a boring disappointment.  Sadly, the same holds true for \\"A Feast for Crows\\".  Martin has relegated his all-star  characters and plotlines to the bench.      I pray to the old gods and new that Martin can resuscitate this series  in A Dance with Dragons.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My DVD series arrived surprisingly quickly and was in fantastic condition (BRAND NEW!). No complaints here, just praise! Thanks!
0440237688|1.0|This book freaked me out as a child, and gave me nightmares.  I love to read, and this is one of the few books that I hate, even to this day.  I'm sure if I read it again, I would get more out of it, but I can't bring myself to do it!
B000000YG5|5.0|I have never been in love with music before. Since hearing \\"Saxophone Colossus\\" for the first time in 2004 I am. His tenor sound is unique and very physical and all but not sentimental. His love of melodies and his melodic creativity kills you like an arrow. His musicality is an experience one cannot put in words. I recommend this album to everyone who looks for an extraordinary musical experience.
1439138311|3.0|The descriptions and the writing in Colm Toibin's novel, Brooklyn, are beautiful; however, the d&eacute;nouement was severely lacking and the character development of the female protagonist was too obviously written by a man. Our main character, Eilis Lacey, begins the book as an eminently sympathetic young Irish woman who has suffered great loss and commits to a life changing journey in spite of her fear, youth, and, for the time, delicate sex. But, as the story progresses, she becomes harder and harder to like as she makes extremely bad choies. Her final decision could have saved her in the reader's eyes if the d&eacute;nouement had given us a chance to forgive her; however, the ending is abrupt and incomplete feeling. Still, this book is worth a read.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|I attended the LA concert, and this DVD completely captures the joy and magic of Barbra Streisand singing LIVE! What more can one say? She is the one true Diva living today. What an honor it was to have been able to see her in person, and what pure ecstasy it is to be able to see her again whenever I wish! You rock Barbra; don't ever let anyone stop the magnificence that is You!
B000R8YC1S|5.0|[[ASIN:B00000K3D4 Labyrinth]] Well made flic. Archetypal, and it ain't easy to sit down and create something that feels like myth. Sarah comes of age when she realizes that 'It's not fair!,'but that's not the point: you deal with it.
B001IBIQU6|1.0|I have now listened to this disc over two dozen times trying desperately to let it grow on me. Unfortunately it is only becoming more apparent how bad an effort this latest mess from Depeche Mode is. I really loved this band at one time but that was when Alan Wilder was part of the band. Once Alan Wilder left, it seemed as the catchy beats, melodies and hooks that crafted Depeche Mode's best songs vanished with him. He was obviously due more credit for their success than he ever received while in the band. Time to bring him back into the fold guys. Otherwise you will just continue with one weak release after another. With maybe one decent song per CD it's just is not worth forking over the cash to listen to the disappointment anymore.
1416562605|5.0|A profound, literary page-turner about the soul, entrepreneurship, murder and transformation. Especially entrepreneurship! The rich imagery and deep metaphors are written simply and without pretense. Adiga conjures poverty and wealth, loyalty and corruption, dignity in filth vividly and with grace.
B001QWBM62|5.0|This product is great. You can record your gigs and even practice with it. I love it. You can not go wrong with this and the price is reasonable. If you are a musician and looking for a recorder to record your gigs, studio work or even practice at home, this is a great buy.
B000286S8S|4.0|I echo what other reviewers have said here. I am no Van Halen zealot, but I do enjoy the band's music. I had a couple of discs, but I bought this one for storing lossless on my AppleTV. Like others, the live tracks seem a bit out of place, but I take no points off for inclusion of unnecessary items. But there is--for me--one glaring fault: the exclusion of \\"Intruder\\" from its role as predecessor to \\"Oh Pretty Woman.\\" I mean, it is that incredible lead up to OPW that makes the song combo such a rocker. The OPW rendition is pretty good on its own, but with Intruder, it is killer. Its absence costs one star for me.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|When I was 16 years old, trying to record my band, I ran some line level inputs into a microphone mixer.  The result was an overly compressed, poor sounding signal, as I was overdriving the mic inputs with the line level, and the signal was \\"clipped.\\"  I considered this recording session a failure, and learned a valuable lesson about audio levels.<br /><br />I find it disturbing that sound engineers these days are intentionally recording music to sound compressed and distorted using brick wall limiting that literally chops off waveforms over a certain level, and then the overall level is maximized on the CD during mastering.<br /><br />The sound of this album is akin to the volume knob on a stereo being turned up too loud, beyond the ability of the amplifier.  The trouble is, when you turn the music down, it still has this same distortion.<br /><br />This is a shame, because this album represents the best performances we have heard from Metallica in years.  If I could give separate ratings for performance and recording I would give five stars for performance, however the clipping on this album bothers me so much, I can't really enjoy it.  The loudness war continues.
B001M7AGBS|1.0|So I figured this was just a bonus version of \\"cross\\". It is a live show. Who in their right mind produces a live techno album? Really? I admit that I rarely enjoy live albums, do to the diminished sound quality. But at least with a standard band there is ambiance and subtle variance in the vocals. That's all.
B001RFIGQ2|4.0|So, I felt a little weird buying this cd because I felt like I was too old to be listening to her (I'm 23). But... I really liked 'La La Land' so I went for it. First of all, her voice is really good. She doesn't really sound like anyone else out there that I have heard. Her voice is very distinguishable if you hear it. I should also say here that I am not a fan of Miley Cyrus or the Jonas Brothers.   So, here's my breakdown of each song:    1. La La Land - The reason I even bought the cd. I listened to some samples online after hearing this song and decided to be open-minded. Very fun, catchy song. Her voice is awesome. This is one of my favorites--just like the beat and how she sings the song.     2. Get Back - A song about wanting to be with someone when you're not. A universal theme if you ask me. She kind of sings the chorus in the way that Kelly Clarkson sings hers--with a lot of emotion and really kind of belts it. Good song.    3. Trainwreck - A song she wrote on her own (she co-wrote most of them). About a guy who is, as the title says, a trainwreck. But that is part of the appeal in him and why she loves him, flaws and all. Another good song.    4. Party - Has a pop-rock beat to it, and she sings appropriately here. Just a fun song, suitable for summer. Her voice sounds really good.    5. On the Line - This song features one of the Jonas Brothers, which it would be better without him. She sounds good, and the song really would be much better without him (in my opinion). About having a fight or breaking up and not wanting to take blame at the time, but feeling bad about it later.     6. Don't Forget - This song has a very vulnerable sound to it, especially the beginning. This song is about being forgotten and having your heart broken. About 2.5 minutes into the song, she really breaks it down and the beat picks up, before slowing down again. Another good song.    7. Gonna Get Caught - A little more upbeat than Don't Forget. About a guy who is basically playing games (that is something any girl can relate to). The chorus is very catchy and upbeat and sticks in your head (which is something that reminds me of Kelly Clarkson's songs). A good one.    8. Two Worlds Collide - A song about a friendship. This is kind of a typical song that teenagers tend to sing. It's not a bad song, but it's not super either. It reminds me somewhat of Ashlee Simpson's 'Giving It All Away' on her first cd (obviously with very different sounding voices).    9. The Middle - This is one that she didn't write on her own. The song starts out a little slower, then it picks up. I actually really like this song. It's really fun to sing along to.    10. Until Your Mine - The grammar freak in me hates that she uses the incorrect form of 'your' (it should be 'you're'), but besides that... The song is a little slower, but the chorus picks up. The chorus is very catchy and she gives it a lot, like most of her other songs. This song is about wanting someone and being willing to do whatever it takes to get them.     11. Believe In Me - A little slower, but the chorus, once again, is catchy, a little more upbeat, and fun to sing along to. About self-esteem and trying to be yourself and believe in yourself. This is something I think many people can relate to, but especially young people when they're trying to find themselves. I really like this song.    12. Behind Enemy Lines (*bonus track) - A different beat. Good song. She sounds a little more soulful when singing this song. I really like this song, which is good since I bought the deluxe edition for this bonus track (the other is in spanish, which I don't speak).      All in all, I really enjoy her voice. It is very good, and she can really belt it out, but doesn't do that too much on this cd (which disappoints me, but I know that some people don't like that). She co-wrote most of the songs, which is awesome. She is 16 and sometimes that is reflected a little bit, but I think that she will definitely havemore to show in the future as an artist as she and her music mature. Just think, Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake started out on the Disney channel. And Britney, who is a great entertainer (maybe not as musically gifted as Christina and Justin)... Anyway the cd is definitely worth checking out.
B001UW58YK|5.0|I've seen all the other Buble DVDs and this is far and away the best. Great Bluray HD presentation with DTS-MA audio makes for a top notch experience as Michael performs his interpretation of the standards. Wonderful band and Wiltern theater setting adds to the experience. Highly recommended.
B0000024RZ|4.0|Recently I reviewed \\"The freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\", and after having listened to more Bob Dylan albums in the meantime, I'd say that that album is his best...it's upbeat, and has a masterpiece on it (Masters of war). Separating some of Bob Dylan's other albums is a bit harder. I'm going with \\"The times they are a changin'\\" as my pick for his second best album. If you like his upbeat albums, there are a few to listen to there. But, for something a bit gloomier, there's less to go around. Dylan does gloomy here, very well indeed.        The title track opens this album, and it is perhaps his greatest song. I was late in discovering \\"Masters of war\\" (which I found out about through hearing bits of it played on one or more documentaries on Dylan), but maybe hadn't appreciated how good this song was until I bought this album. As with all the songs on this album, the instruments used are accoustic guitar, or accoustic guitar with harmonica bursts. This song features the harmonica.  It's not usually mentioned, I don't think, but the lyrics to this song cut both ways...in the movie \\"Bob Roberts\\", I think, there is a parody of this song, of sorts. It takes a more conservative view of things. In any case, there is nothing necessarily left-wing about this song, I don't think. The simple strumming on this song is a pleasure, but if I am to find fault with this song, there is a point towards its end, where you feel Dylan falls too much in love with his words, and he perhaps uses too many of them. Minor flaw, in any case.     Only a pawn in their game: my pick as the albums second best song. Again, this is a song which I only found out about by watching a documentary on Dylan (I've seen two...one from the late 60's I think, and Martin Scorcese's one, I think). Surprisingly, this song, like many I consider to be his best (like \\"Masters of war\\"), don't appear on \\"Best of\\" compilations.  It has political analysis of race politics during the time of America's own Apartheid. The names invoked in this song were lost on me, as an Australian, but I got the gist of the song's intent.     Other songs I liked well enough:    North country blues: I'm a huge fan of Billy Joel, and I consider \\"Allentown\\" one of his greatest songs. This seems to be Bob Dylan's own \\"Allentown\\", without that later song's catchy poppiness. Dylan's song is just him on his accoustic guitar, with no harmonica. Languid style, with a grungy word picture painted by the man. His plaintive vocals work well.     The lonesome death of Hattie Carroll: Dylan as a chronicler of a miscarriage of justice, due to class factors. Probably based on a true story, but, again, the American references are lost on me. Dylan's harmonica playing here is a treat at times. Features harmonica to good effect.    Restless farewell:  This song, and Dylan almost sound Irish here. The guitar sound in this song is quite interesting...occasionally stuttering, and sounding a bit like a harp or some such.     A couple other songs of interest:    With God on our side: longest song on the album, at 7:07 minutest long. Every now and again people I interact with on the web would quote this song. It seems to be the song which holds a mirror up to American society, and reflects back a harsh reality on it. As far as I can tell, this is the only song you could perhaps infer had a Jewish writer from Dylan's catalogue. Dylan is in fact Jewish, but I think this is the only song where Jewish history gets a mention.  Quite a scathing critique of what invoking God allows one to do or get away with. Features harmonica to good effect.     Ballad of Hollis Brown: again, could be based on a true story. An affecting word picture of quiet desperation.       Watching those documentaries on Dylan, he'd often protest that he wasn't a protest singer. With many songs on these albums, you'd have to say that he was fooling himself. Dylan protests all manner of subject here: uses/abuses of religion, social injustice, racism etc. PerhapsDylan saw himself as more the artist than a protester. One can ponder on the rights and wrongs of naming names in many songs in here...people who have died tragic deaths, and whether turning their songs into art is fair on their loved ones. If Dylan wrote these songs not too long after some of the tragedies mentioned in his songs, you could view that as being exploitative of the victims.       As an Australian unaffected by some of these tragedies, I can't say that these rights and wrongs have much to do with me.        Even though Amazon lists this unremastered cd as out of circulation, I recentlyish bought it new in a chain store in Australia. In some cases, for some albums, I'm not sure that a remaster is a clear winner (as for \\"The freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\"). In other cases, maybe there is something to be said for the remaster (as for \\"Blonde on blonde\\"). In the case of this album, I'm inclined to think saving money on an unremastered cd is the smarter choice...just because the sound is so sparse and not given to the more wider sound-scape of albums like \\"Blonde on blonde\\".        Anyway, if you are inclined to the moody, this album's downbeat themes and occasionally plaintive vocals could be a revealation for you. Dylan's guitar playing tends sometimes to plucking notes, and sometimes to softly strumming.  This album is a good antidote to Dylan's more upbeat albums.       Some recommened Dylan albums:    For accoustic guitar: especially \\"The freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\", which is quite upbeat. His self-titled debut is not without interest either.    For upbeat albums: try \\"Blonde on blonde\\", though this does feature electric guitar.    If you like \\"The times they are a changin'\\" for the general mood of the album, I tend to like \\"Blood on the track\\" for similar reasons...although it has a different mood to this album. It's more \\"chill out\\" music. A Dylan for every mood.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|**update, August 2009**    I had \\"reviewed\\" this CD shortly after it came out, but admittedly, it was mostly a response to other comments.  It's been several months, so I thought I'd give it another review after it sunk in for a while.    First, I'm taking one star off my previous ranking, after some of the hope/enthusiasm has worn off.  It's not worst-album-ever-I've-been-in-tears-since-Alan-Wilder-left-16-years-ago, but \\"meh\\" could sum it up well.  In short, the production dragged it down.  I curse Ben Hillier, for making everything way too flat and compressed, hiding all the good musical bits behind vocals, quieting the drums so much they're almost non-existent, and bringing out sound effects when they make little sense.  Many of the songs also sound like Dave and Martin are fighting to be the lead on the microphone at once.  Dave vox, good, Martin vox, good, both through a whole song, a little cacaphonous.    In Chains - Well, the past few albums have typically started with some kind of noise, so I guess it's nothing new.  But the song itself is allright, and one of the best for Dave.  A little repetitive, maybe.    Hole To Feed - a bit brave to try a swing tempo, but it gets messy, and it's not at all catchy or emotional.  I don't see it as a single, but I guess others do.  Reminds me of Exciter tracks like Sweetest Condition.    Wrong - Hands down my favorite on the album.  A brutal, Pimpf-style buildup, and Dave is solid from start to finish (must've helped that half the words were the same :) ), and Martin only needs two words to finish it right.  Backing music is more classic Music For the Masses/Black Celebration era progression, and the strong electro pads and effects all fit better here than the other tracks.    Fragile Tension - One of the catchier tracks on the album, I could possibly see this as a single.  Granted, it sounds a bit like a U2 track at times and shows their VH1-era maturity.    Little Soul - doesn't quite resonate with me, but I admire the (relative) quietness and background guitars.  Because it's so flat nothing really stands out.    In Sympathy - tries to be catchy, but there's just not enough substance to the tune.  By the chorus you're waiting for each syllable to come out already.  Nice listening, but after 3 minutes it gets dull.    Peace - OK, I'm going to go against the praise of many reviewers by saying I do NOT like this song.  The retro synth at the start brings in old fans (cough*See You*cough), I'm sure, but the vocals immediately take over everything else.  Then, it ends up sounding like three different songs mashed into one.  A strong buildup, then poof, back to the drumless song.  I cringe each time Dave belts out \\"I'm going to light up the world!\\" in falsetto like in an Apple iPhone ad.  Peace is nice, but it doesn't mean you have to drown out everything else when you sing it.    Come Back - And again, I'll go against the grain and say this is a real gem!  Dave's blues style fits in perfectly (a bit like Songs of Faith and Devotion era), and the guitars give off almost an early-90s \\"shoegazing\\" vibe.  It runs out of energy toward the end, but it's good background rock.    Spacewalker - a cute interlude, too much compression as usual..    Perfect - a simple (too simple?), enjoyable pop track.  Like others, it's a bit too short on percussion, and the guitar effects in the chorus don't fit too well with the rest of the tune.  Martin provides good background vox though.    Miles Away - The Truth Is - one of the more awkward Depeche Mode song titles.. like Hand to Feed, it's too messy.  Pitch bends all over the place, to the point of dissonance.  Just weird, I don't know.. maybe I'll appreciate it more in five years. :)    Jezebel - another very underrated tune.  Martin absolutely shines.  By chance, the darkest track on the album (a leftover from Playing the Angel, maybe?).  Only complaints are, the bathroom-like reverb on the vocals is weird, and the compression flattens out what could be a great melody at the end.    Corrupt - Has the potential to be the second strongest track after Wrong, but the guitars sound tired and rhyming sounds forced (ugly-drugs be? your hips-your lips?), with no single sound standing out.  Then at the end, a quick reprise of Wrong to remind you it was probably the best track on the album.    I find it interesting that there are so many different opinions of what the good/bad tracks on the album are.  But there is more consensus that it's a mixed bag, some good, some not so good.  And I'd prefer it all be good.. or some great, some good.  If someone could do an actual proper mix of the darn thing, and not make it sound like it was someone's first production job ever, maybe I'd put it on play a bit more often.  I guess the cover art is a representation of the songs - trying to be different, but really a bunch of same sized sticks thrown together in a messy fashion.    **original review, April 2009**    \\"The 80's are over. Deal with it.\\"    If you are looking for 80s synthpop, buy an 80s synthpop CD, it's that simple.  Depeche Mode have evolved over the past 30 years, and if they didn't, they would probably no longer be making music.  You don't have to like the current style, but the fact that you don't does not make it the \\"Worst. Album. Ever.\\".  This is a very confident, solid album.  If Playing The Angel was about pain and suffering, SotU is about dealing with it and getting over it.  Not quite as happy-lovey as Exciter, but two melancholy albums in a row would be overdoing it.  The album title makes it sound like another Music For The Masses, but it's really closer to Songs of Faith and Devotion, if you can really compare it to any previous album at all.  There are some vintage synths used, but the sound is fairly new, bringing in much blues-soul inspiration from Dave Gahan's solo work into electro-rock tracks.  Dave hits some higher notes than usual and his voice takes front and center on the album.  Martin only hasone lead track on the album, \\"Jezebel\\", but it is a very good one.  \\"Wrong\\" remains the same as the single version, and my personal favorite on the album.  The production is still too compressed (i.e. everything is close in volume), and the drums are weak.  There's not much creative or profound in the lyrics either, but, after a few listens, the music really gets soulful and inspiring.  There are no pop-radio singles like Precious, but there is plenty of remix potential.  While it's not my favorite DM album at all, it irks me to see people rate it one star because it doesn't sound like their favorite 80s or 90s synthpop album.  These are probably the people who cried when they first heard the guitar in \\"I Feel You\\".  DM should be admired for keeping up with the times and staying relevant in the music world.

Until Your Mine - The grammar freak in me hates that she uses the incorrect form of 'your' (it should be 'you're'), but besides that... The song is a little slower, but the chorus picks up. The chorus is very catchy and she gives it a lot, like most of her other songs. This song is about wanting someone and being willing to do whatever it takes to get them.     11. Believe In Me - A little slower, but the chorus, once again, is catchy, a little more upbeat, and fun to sing along to. About self-esteem and trying to be yourself and believe in yourself. This is something I think many people can relate to, but especially young people when they're trying to find themselves. I really like this song.       All in all, I really enjoy her voice. It is very good, and she can really belt it out, but doesn't do that too much on this cd (which disappoints me, but I know that some people don't like that). She co-wrote most of the songs, which is awesome. She is 16 and sometimes that is reflected a little bit, but I think that she will definitely have more to show in the future as an artist as she and her music mature. Just think, Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake started out on the Disney channel. And Britney, who is a great entertainer (maybe not as musically gifted as Christina and Justin)... Anywaythe cd is definitely worth checking out.
0446618306|2.0|After all of that development of how much they loved each other, Parts II and III just ruined it.  It skimmed through 9/11 and the war, and why he stayed in the military longer.  That was put in the story just as a little interlude of why he didn't come home at the end of his service.  There was no depth or feeling about what that meant for anyone.  Then, all of the sudden she found someone new, and when he returns, low and behold, she's married to Tim who happens to be dying?  Wait, what just happened here?  I didn't find what any of them did as a sign of true love.  John, Savannah, and Tim suddenly became victims of their own selfish thoughts in the name of loving the other too much for their own good.  Selling his Dad's coins for that?  Stealing John's girl?  Dumping John because he hasn't come home yet... to be with your best friend instead?  I give it 2 stars because the love seemed like it had great promise to mean so much more, and it fizzled at the end.
B00022TPSO|3.0|A while back I reviewed Black Sabbath's two cd best of compilation (\\"The best of Black Sabbath\\") and found it wanting. Having listened to their debut album, I think I can point the finger at why I found that to be the case: when you buy a greatest hits albums, well, you want many of the songs to sound like greatest hits. To me, their compilation lacked that, except for a few songs.        So, whilst the greatest hits experience was underwhelming, it's when you buy a studio album and have no expectation of the songs having to measure up to some ideal, that you can appreciate the music more.       Last week I bought this album, and Led Zeppelin's eponymous debut album. This was because I wanted to explore the origin of heavy metal. Both these albums can be considered the foundational heavy metal album, according to whatever music critic you listen to. Just posted up a revew of Led Zeppelin's debut album today. Not for Black Sabbath:       Unlike Led Zeppelin's album, I can't really point to this or that song as being worthy of a spot on a greatest hits album.  I can say that this is not necessarily a bad thing. That's because the entire album has a sense of unity of purpose. It's an album experience you get, in other words, not a great (or lame, as the case may be) 'greatest hits' experience.       Some songs of interest include:    Black Sabbath: I liked the ambient introduction to this song...rain, thunder and bells. It has a melodramatic, gothic guitar riff to it. This riff maybe has some overlap with a track from that Led Zeppelin album I reviewed today. This is a band where they don't drown out the bass player, which is good.     The Wizard: I enjoyed the harmonica playing on this, by lead singer \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne. It has an other worldly quality to it. The guitar riff is quite heavy.    Behind the wall of sleep: bluesy lead guitar (blues is an influence on this album, and Led Zeppelin's). Bass guitar. Grinding guitar. Viking melody, so to speak, and an intersting drum outro.    N.I.B: funky bass intro, heavy, jarring hard rock riff. Another nursery rhyme type vocal style by Ozzy. The lead guitar solo does have a whiff of heavy metal.     Evil woman: bass run all the way through. Short, sharp and nasty riff. Actually, the intro reminds me of a Boz Scaggs song! Can't remember which...\\"Lido shuffle\\" for the bass?    Sleeping village: I like the introduction to this song-very reminiscent of a later song by heavy metal outfit Helloween, specifically their terrific song \\"Immortal\\". Helloween have a good pop/melodic sensibility with that song...a trait not shared with by Black Sabbath so much.    The warning: longest track at 10 1/2 minutes long. Bluesy lead guitar, bassy, bass runs. Near the end of the track, there is guitar playing which I guess could be described as \\"shredding\\". No expert on this though...I know that metal fans often talk about \\"shredding\\" with approval. I like the lead guitar playing near the end of the song.    Wicked world: has a jazzy drumming intro. Bassy. Vocals seem unintentionally distorted. Quite a riffing track, and sometimes bluesy.       Hmmm...seem to have discussed every track on this album!       I'm giving this album 66.6/100. Mainly for the occultish reference signified in this score. The album is occultish at times...which may signal that this album was the first heavy metal album...at least as far as that aspect of metal goes (I mean the fascination with the occult).        Seeing as I tend to like songs which fit better into the 'greatest hits' kind of mould, I can't say that I like this album enough to give it more than what I have scored it here. In fact, pretty much the only songs that I really liked on that compilation of mine came from their album \\"Paranoid\\". If I get around to reviewing that, I think I may be inclined to give it a much higher score than I have for anything else that I've reviewed by them here.        Lastly, must say how pleasantly surprised I was by the sound quality on this album. Not exactly sure which version of this album I have-the one with all the songs I've listed here, obviously (other versions have slight variation in track listings)-but this album SEEMED to sound cleaner than on my compilation. Was expecting this album to maybe be not proper stereo, as stereo was a new invention around this era. The ambient noise on the title track here seemed to be much better in quality than my compilation album. Just going on memory here...haven't listened to that compilation for a long time.       A solid album, and more heavy metal, taken as a whole, than Led Zeppelin's debut album.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Please refer to Hanna Arendt's book Eichmann in Jerusalem from whence the above phrase is coined.       Was the woman in this movie a monster, a clown, or just a tiny cog in the wheel of slaughter who refused to open the door to a burning church because it was her job to oversee the jews who were burning inside and if they got out she wouldn't be able to round them up?  Her defense (just as Eichmann's in his trial) was that she was just doing her job.  Thus the banality of evil because in the end evil on such a scale can only be accomplished by thousands of people who are only doing what they're told.  And we feel for this woman a bit because she likes to be read to from Homer which makes her all too human.  She's sort of like us in a lot of ways.  But then there's one thing at the end that's hard to wrap your mind around;  she tells him (her former lover) she never thought about the night of the burning church until her trial 20 years later because she never had to.  Think about it.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I've read many reviews and first impressions about Sounds of the Universe, and I've seen thoughts that range across the ratings. I'm going to throw my hat in on the 5-star rating. Simply, I think this is the best Depeche Mode album of their career, a career my wife and I have followed closely from the beginning as a band that has defined every stage of our lives from high school to middle-age. I believe this album represents both a synthesis across the DM career and an evolution in sound and mood. In Chains is a great opener, soulful and building. Hole to Feed pushes into the trademark DM sexy with layers of sound and riffs that are reminiscent of the early 90's DM. Wrong is marching ballad that reminds me of of the Playing the Angel crossed with their early syth (and the video is positively creepy!). Fragile smooths into a wistful, romantic groove that frankly is my favorite song of the CD. Little Soul really takes me back to Violator with a extra fresh and positive vibe mixed with early DM sound blurbs and the ever-lovely layers of vocal melody. Sympathy is a positive and uplifting song that reminds me of my previously favorite album, Exciter. Peace starts with sound right from early DM then blossoms into relaxing hymn. Come Back is another romantic song that will most definitely end up as movie soundtrack. Spacewalker is a nice little interlude with a very DM sound, although I might have like to see it expanded as a full song with Martin's great lyrics. Perfect is a good song, although I'd probably rank it as the weakest of the album--still, it's great! Miles Away / The Truth Is surely is one of those songs that David will end up grinding to on the stage. I really love the song Jezeble--it's so typical DM mood. Corrupt is a great album closer and has a lot of DM sounds from the 90's and 2000's twisted together in a sexy groove that is a must for the concert this fall. And, yes, I'm seeing DM this fall--I can't wait to hear Sounds of the Universe in concert along with other DM standards I hope they play such as Personal Jesus, Get the Balance Right, Enjoy the Silence, and I Feel Loved. Enjoy SOTU! Tora! Tora! Tora!with other DM standards I hope they play such as Personal Jesus, Get the Balance Right, Enjoy the Silence, and I Feel Loved. Enjoy SOTU! Tora! Tora! Tora!
0553381687|5.0|I was lent this book by a friend and numerous recommendations, I settled down to read it. I was drawn into the violent and vivid world of Westeros. I followed the voyage of Ned Stark and his family from the cold reaches of the North and enjoyed the tangled web that permeated the world he found himself in. I sped through it, falling in love with several characters and crying bitterly when one failed to make it.<br /><br />An excellent start to the song of ice and fire series.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|It's a slight edge over TV On the Radio in a weaker year, but this brilliant album gets my vote, for what it's worth. It's so damn truthfully heartfelt that you can't help but love it. It also seems to get better and better as it progresses... a big plus for me. I hate front-loaded albums. Will easily make the decade's Top 50.

0618680004|2.0|Dawkins book has a number of strong points.  It is easy to read, clear and no ambiguity as to what he thinks. The book is humorous in many places, some of them appear to be intentional. In one place he creates a Bob Newhart style dialogue between God and one of the subjects in an experiment to test the efficacy of prayer in curing illness.  The subject is a cardiac patient in the placebo group.  It's very funny.  Aside from this the book seems to operate at a junior high school level.  First there's the manic tendency to generalize.  Religeon, a subject about which he seems to know as much as the taxi driver who sneers a quantum mechanics, he treats as a vast yet fairly uniform phenomenon.  In order to address the question of God's existence a person should know quite a bit of philosophy, theology, archaeology, studies of the bible, koran etc., the various kinds of religeous experience, ethics, psychology, cosmology, and many other disciplines.  You wpould also want to be the kind of person who could be reasonably objective and intelligent enough to evaluate all this in conjunction with your personal experience.  A person in this situation might still be left  unsure.  Now a writer might not have these kinds of qualifications, and still write something which added to the  discussion.  Still it points up the absurdity of making it all sound like a breeze and anyone disagreeing must be deluded. A couple  of examples: Dawkins characterises faith as belief without evidence or even in the teeth of negative evidence.  But faith can mean many different things.  A physics professor had a large round metal ball suspended pendulum style from the ceiling.  He or a student, standing on a platform would be asked to hold the ball a couple of inches from their face let it go and remain imobile as the ball swung out and then back  toward them.  This was a sort of test of faith in the laws of the physics they had learned.  A person who has known and had good reason to trust a friendor spouse gets some evidence that the person has done something scurrilous.  The evidence is of fair quality, but hardley conclusive.  If the accusation can neither be confirmed or rebutted, is it irrational to have faith in their friend? Moving on, Dawkins likes science.  He reifies it then deifies it.  He also charachterizes people who believe in God as deluded and even as a symptom of mental illness. In other places he says they are quite stupid.  When I applied this test to Copernicus, Pascal, Descartes, Bacon, Galileo, Kepler, Kant, Linnaeus, Faraday, Maxwell, Lyle, Kelvin, Pastuer, Planck and many others I was astounded by the result.  They were all deluded.  Poor delusional Newton wrote more on theology then science.  This book is pretty bad, though it does have flashes of mediocrity.  Hume and Russell did it better.

0321543726|5.0|I had just finished reading Herbert Schildt's book C++: The Complete Reference and had resolved not to read another door stop before devoting much more time to practising the new techniques I had learned. Then I got wind of Bjarne Stroustrup's new book for beginners: Programming Principles and Practice Using C++. Now Dr Stroustrup occupies a very elevated position in the panoply of C++ deities; his words are cast in stone and he is often referred to as \\"the creator\\" of C++ (read: he invented it). Most programming tutorials have shortcomings of one kind or another, so I was intrigued to discover what sort of a job BS had done. I was not disappointed.    Firstly, his approach is not to treat learning C++ as a purely language-technical issue, but to talk about programming as a means to the solving of problems, and use C++ (the most versatile and widely used programming language we have) as a vehicle to do this.    After a dedication to Lawrence Petersen, his collaborator on this project, there is an interesting chapter concerning the place of computer systems in modern life.    Programming is introduced in the conventional way with the simplest concepts, then the learning curve becomes progressively steeper (a feature which is required of a reasonably complete introduction to the subject, even given the 1264 pages of this book).    BS uses several techniques that I had not seen before. All the code is printed in a bold typeface in blue. That makes it easier to distinguish code terms from other, possibly similar words within the body text. He does not use unnecessary spaces in his code. This helps to clarify where spaces are actually required by the syntax as opposed to merely beautifying the code. It also allows more characters per line, but the downside is that the code tends to look more crowded.    Nearly every chapter ends with a set of drills (short exercises), a review of all the new material introduced in the chapter, a list of the new terms, a very comprehensive and well thought out set of more substantial exercises and a postscript giving final thoughts. If students were to take on these exercises in a conscientious way I have no doubt that the learning curve would be flattened to a great extent and they would rapidly gain proficiency in programming.    Having prepared the ground thoroughly, BS raises the level of activity by introducing programming techniques which produce graphical output, and devotes 160 pages in five chapters to it. An independently produced lightweight graphical user interface package called FLTK has to be downloaded and installed for this purpose (its free of charge). FLTK was chosen partly because it is a cross-platform system (cross platform functionality being one of BS's hobby horses, although one which is justified). I found this part of the book a bit tedious, mainly because I am not greatly interested in graphics at present and partly because I did not have the time to play with the system sufficiently.    Two thirds of the way through the book is a refreshing and fascinating chapter dealing with the history of programming and some of the personalities involved; something I had not thought of investigating in any detail before. Colour photographs are another feature of this book which adds to its appeal.    An important theme of the book is the idea that its all too easy to make mistakes when programming, but there are ways to mitigate this. BS owns up and highlights many mistakes he made (some of them deliberate, for pedagogical reasons) when writing programs for the book. I find that both endearing and encouraging. Major sections deal with debugging and system testing, including the recording of run-time.    The last chapter is an introduction to the C programming language. I was very pleased to see that since you cannot go very far in the world of C++ without tripping over branches of C code, and it helps a lot if you can understand it. There are five appendices which provide useful reference material and some extra ideas for anyone who has stayed the course.    The book is supported by some excellent web pages with supporting material including an errata list and well designed tutorial materials for teachers.    I found this book generally very revealing and rate it not only excellent, but inspiring. It provides the means to become a good programmer if you are prepared to do the work, and the encouragement to do so.

1416550542|4.0|In 1913, an Australian dock master found a solitary child on a disembarking ship, seemingly all alone. She wouldn't - or couldn't - tell him who she was, who she'd come with, or why.    As he could hardly leave such a tiny little girl on her own, the dock master took the child home. Before he knew it, he and his wife had adopted little \\"Nell,\\" and it was as if she'd always been their natural daughter -- even in the years after, when their own many daughters joined the family. In fact, young Nell never remembered differently -- until her father made the mistake of telling her the truth on her 21st birthday.    Suddenly, the world as Nell had known it collapsed. No longer did she feel worthy of, or equal to, the people who had cared for her and loved her most of her life. All she wanted was to solve the mystery of her origin, find out where she had come from, who had abandoned her and WHY.    Yet despite her best efforts, Nell died before she was ever to find the answers. It's now up to her granddaughter Cassandra -- herself deeply troubled and grieving, desperately trying to find her way in life again -- to take on the cause of the woman who raised her. Thus Cassandra embarks on a memorable trip to Cornwall, England, visiting the tiny village of Nell's birth, speaking with family and descendants of people who were present when her grandmother was born. With each person, Cassandra learns a tiny bit more of the agonizing secrets.    The one downfall of this book, perhaps, is her choice of voices -- the author fluctuates between present-day Cassandra, little-girl and middle-aged Nell, AND the mysterious \\"Authoress\\" Eliza Makepeace, in various stages of her life (it isn't revealed until much later what her connection to Nell and Cass could be). The jumps between the various characters' voices -- not to mention the time periods -- is quite jarring for readers, as they must struggle to remember after each chapter who's speaking now.    Don't let that put you off, however.Morton's story is an intriguing read, very real and hard to put down.
B001K3JF7K|3.0|Ok I \\"like\\" it...to a point because it is Diana Krall...but...oh I'm sorry I dozed off. Everyone has the same thoughts very sleepy. And I don't care for gender switching i.e. \\"I've Grown Accustomed to His Face\\" and \\"The Boy from Ipanema\\" (I mean Astrud sang that as \\"The Girl...\\" originally right?)   Someone else mentioned ever since Elvis she hasn't been right. Well, that's an interesting idea. But I must admit I loved \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\" the majority of which she wrote with Elvis. Ya know if she had done more songs like those I'd be way more happier than \\"Quiet Nights\\". Like it's been said, what's happened to Diana?     What I wish she would do is back off on the bossa nova and do an album of Joni Mitchell songs. Her renditions of \\"Case of You\\" and \\"Black Crow\\" are awesome! Anyway if she can't sing like herself anymore, she should sing more like Joni M. and never like Nora J.!

The story revolves around a set of twins, Rahel and Estha, and the family secrets and scandals that lead to the death of the twins' cousin, Sophie Mol.<br /><br />I expected to like this book more than I did, given all of its critical acclaim. However, although the core of the story is intriguing and the writing itself is good, the author spins off in many different directions and weighs down the book with excessive verbiage, which caused me to severely lose interest. Also, I never felt fully vested in any of the characters, which is unfortunate given the high emotional stakes in this novel.<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed. I expected much more from a Booker Prize winner.

Well since I seen this film I went back and watched the series and it makes a lot more things that take place in this series add up. While it's not truly set in the series time line I at least knew more of what was going on. So I decided to buy this movie on blu-ray.   So with the story being abit confusing to those who've not seen anything related to the franchise since the 80's its still a good film with great visuals and a pretty interesting story .  blu-ray makes it even better with crisp picture and sound.    Well worth watching .

Lisa Genova skillfully compresses the many microevents in the life of a person experiencing the onset and progress of Alzheimer's and hands us a picture in words of what may lie ahead.    My copy, a gift from a friend, currently is making the rounds of the forty- and fifty-something (and more!) women in two extended families, both touched by AD. There's a sense of comfort and unity in knowing our hands and eyes and tears touched the same pages.

Then Blood Mountain came out and I fell in love with this band's impressive musical abilities and diversity.  Needless to say I re-evaluated their entire back catalog.  I truly love everything they have to offer now.  This album is no exception.  This album is easily their softest, thus their most accessible.  If you have an interest in Mastodon, or are into this kind of music...you should definitely check this out.  Even if you aren't into this kind of music and you just appreciate good music...you should definitely check this out.

It's actually pretty lame even w/o the [...] talk. The girls who are reading Twilight are anywhere from 10 on up. Do you want your 10 year to read about a girl's private area being pierced? Or reading about a girl going down on a guy in the hall way in the House of Night? Granted the character is 17 but Zoey Redbird is no Bella Swan.
0143038419|5.0|Not only is this book thoroughly entertaining, but it also chronicles the author's personal and spiritual growth, which I found to be both thought-provoking and personally relevant. Part 1 is a savory journey of self re-discovery, a delicious reading of Italian culture, blended with just the right amount of honest confession, and topped with a froth of humorous observation. As the author's journey continues to a spiritual Ashram in India, and then on to a world of sensory delight in Indonesia, the reader is vicariously and intrepidly at her side, experiencing every longing for a leap of faith, a moment of transcendence, a deeper transformation. A perfect read for cold winter nights--best enjoyed in bite size chapters and paired with a glass of Valpolicella, a cup of hot chai, and a dash of coconut ice cream.

B000UL61D4|3.0|Anyone who has an interest in Eastern European cinema probably knows the label Facets, the grin-and-bear-it, necessary-evil company that distributes most major titles of Czech and Polish classics in the US in barely tolerable (or intolerable) releases that skirt bootleg quality. They distribute DVDs for PolArt, which issues \\"unauthorized\\" releases of Polish films -- whatever that means.    The two PolArt Zulawski releases, The Devil and On the Silver Globe, are pretty much the only available releases of these films here or in the UK. It could be worse -- these are not unwatchable, and fans of the filmmaker will want to catch these films in whatever form they can get them in.     But I wouldn't buy these releases. Mondo Vision has been issuing superb editions of Zulawski films (La femme publique, and The Most Important Thing: Love is coming soon), and apparently holds the rights to almost all of the Zulawski catalogue, including these two films. I would hazard a guess that its only a matter of time before these two films get a beautiful, worthy release for about the same price as these shoddy pseudo-bootlegs.     Just hold out a little while longer, Zulawski fans.
0312383320|1.0|I was afraid I was the only person out there, in the cyber void, insisting that Janet Evanovitch was capable of better.  Her books are on a downward trend almost equalled by the upward trend of the styling of her back cover pictures.<br /><br />My analysis is that as she get richer, more successful and stylish, her books get less well plotted, the people we have come to know and love get less well defined, she is getting sloppy with her writing.<br /><br />Please Janet dear, you hooked us with your talent and wit, it is still there somewhere in between the appointments with your manicurist, hairdresser, stylist, business manager etc etc etc.  I know how distracting this life can be, having lived it myself (once upon a time).<br /><br />So, thank you \\"happiness is reading, c.lyn panovitch, samurai_sally, J.K. Waldron, Lanae, k. Bui, A.

B000FBJAF0|1.0|Intrigued by the alternating one and 5 star ratings of this book, I downloaded a free sample. I am not familiar with Forsyth's work, so you could say it was a fairly objective first cold read.<br /><br />I read the first sentence. I shook my head then read it again. Then I nearly fell on the floor laughing. This is so over the top It reminded me of the type of wretchedly excessive, histrionic stories a freshman boy with an excess of testosterone running rampent through his veins might  turn in. Once. The teacher and classmate's reaction would, one would hope, persuade the lad to take a pin to his ego and deflate it a smidge.<br /><br />For what it's worth, it seemed most of the 5 star reviews came from USA. Too much testosterone and too little taste?<br /><br />I gather Forsyth has written some top notch stuff in the past. Could it be the august author is a tad  off his trolley and no one has the balls to edit him properly?<br /><br />I did enjoy that first sentence but I'm afraid it's a one joke novel and the rest would not be nearly as fun.<br /><br />by  the way I am from USA

B0006GANOQ|5.0|Speed is a great action movie. It's got a cool set-up, it wastes no time jumping directly into the action, and it's got excitement that never lets up.    Keanu Reeves plays Jack Travern, an officer with the LAPD, who along with his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) saves an elevator fill of people from a mad bomber (Dennis Hopper). By the end of it, it seems that the bomber is dead and the two are awarded medals for their bravery. Soon after, a bus blows up before Jack's eyes and the bomber calls him to give him the set-up. There is another bus with a bomb on it. The bomb will be activated once the bus reached 50 miles per house. If it drops below 50, it will explode. Furthermore, the bomber wants 3 million dollars by 11 a.m. Once on the bus, Jack meets Annie (Sandra Bullock), a loud-mouthed, charming passenger who ends up driving the death trap while the bomber watches the action play out on TV.    The idea isn't very original, but screenwriter Graham Yost kicks the thing into overdrive the minute the film begins. He also throws a few curveballs every couple of minutes to keep the audience on their feet. The excitement, tension, and suspense the film creates does not die down until the credits finally roll.    With that said, Keanu Reeves isn't very convincing at times. In the first few minutes he appears fidgety (no joke) and confused. Physically, he fits the role pretty well but the man endlessly struggles to deliver his dialogue convincingly. You'll know what I mean when he says \\"there's enough C4 on this thing to put a hole in the world.\\" Luckily, Reeves doesn't need to be very good because (A) it's an action movie and (B) it is so well made that everyone else is good enough to offset the man.    If Bullock's role has been cast differently, many of the scenes on the bus (roughly 85% of the movie) wouldn't have worked as well. Her charm, even when her character gets rather is annoying, is what really counteracts some of Reeves' more annoying acting qualities. I'll take it a step further by saying I don't think Bullock has been more charming. She's cute and gritty enough to pull off her role perfectly.    Hopper could sleep walk through this role as he's accustomed to playing it at this point. He's still appropriately diabolical. Finally, Jeff Daniels turns in strong supporting work as Jack's partner.    It's funny though; despite my paragraph about Reeves, I can't really picture anyone else in this role and I'm not sure I'd want anyone else. But, moving on, the movie is one long, great action scene and it's unlikely you'll find an action film more entertaining. Some of the dialogue's not that great (or maybe it's just Reeves' delivery), but everything about this movie makes it so superior to other movies in its genre.    GRADE: A-
B001IBIQU6|4.0|With the promise that \\"Wrong\\" delivered as a single, would the whole album be as good? I have to honestly admit that as the first song of the album (In Chains) started, I ended up being disappointed. I listened to it, but longed for a better follow up. Then came \\"Hole To Feed\\" and my faith (and devotion) to Depeche Mode and their music was restored. Where the first song lacked spark, this one got the fire going. Followed by \\"Wrong\\" I was feeling pretty good. Listening to the remainder of the album left me feeling satisfied and anxious for the upcoming Tour of the Universe. I know some of these songs are going to be amazing live! Other stand out songs for me are \\"Come Back\\" (which along with \\"Hole To Feed\\" and \\"Miles Away/The Truth Is\\" was written by Dave Gahan), \\"In Sympathy\\", \\"Peace\\", and \\"Fragile Tension\\". Of course everyone will have their opinions on whether this is a good album, a disappointment, or just okay. I say it's a good album. I say Depeche Mode will always be a crowd pleaser. And I say everyone should give this album a chance - the die hard fan, the casual fan - I think it will appeal to a very wide range.

B001TOD92C|5.0|When I was a little kid, I used to stay up late on Saturday nights with my Dad to watch WWF matches.  Those were the days of Hulk Hogan, Roddy \\"Rowdy\\" Piper, Iron Shiek, Andre the Giant, Capt. Lou Albano, Jake \\"the Snake\\" Roberts, Randy \\"The Macho Man\\" Savage, Hillbilly Jim, Junkyard Dog, and Sgt. Slaughter.  My grandfather told me that the wrestling we watched was all fake, but it didn't look fake to me. I was enthralled by the matches, the battles, and the spectacle of it all.  It was thoroughly entertaining.  However, my Grandpa was right. Most of it was fake.  The majority of those matches were staged and the winners and losers were decided long ahead of time.  I've long since outgrown watching \\"professional\\" wrestling, but those old stars of the WWF hold a special place for me and will hold my interest.<br /><br />Enter THE WRESTLER, the latest film from the director wiz-kid who is a master of cinematography, Darren Aronofsky.  Aronofsky became a star with the movie PI and cemented his place on the echelon of top directors with his follow up feature, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. For a casual film watcher, those movies are difficult to follow and at times even difficult to watch.  However, the cinematography of those pictures is amazing and both those movies ask huge questions about life and its meaning.  Aronofsky's last movie, THE FOUNTAIN, was a bit more flashy, but was also full of philosophy.  Illustrating that he really is a director with a lot of talent, THE WRESTLER is a movie that is completely different from anything Aronofsky has directed so far.<br /><br />Shot mostly on hand-held cameras, THE WRESTLER follows Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke).  Molded after the wrestlers I passionately followed in my childhood, Randy used to be the top of his field.  In the 1980s Randy was a hugely popular \\"professional\\" wrestler. He was so popular that there was an action figure of him and he was a popular character on a hot-selling video game.  Randy had to have made a lot of money during his career, but the movie never explains what happened to his fortune.  Instead, when we meet Randy he's still wrestling when he can, but he lives in a rented trailer that he often pays for late and is works part-time in the loading docks of a grocery store to make ends meet. He spends most of his evenings at strip clubs and at one in particular he has a favorite girl, Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) that he finds himself developing feelings for. One night after a particularly physical grueling match, Randy looses conscience in the dressing room and when he awakes he finds himself in a hospital.  It turns out that Randy has had a heart attack.  The doctors say he will recover, but tell him he can't wrestle again.  His heart attack leads Randy to do some soul searching.  He attempts to let Cassidy know how he feels and reaches out to his college-aged daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood).  Randy really is a likeable guy who, like many people, makes mistakes and ends up hurting those he loves.  He knows the wrestling and the life of the ring, but outside of that he is lost.  He really does make an effort of changing, but the odds are still against him.<br /><br />I really enjoyed THE WRESTLER. Mickey Rourke gives the acting performance of 2008 (even though he didn't win the Oscar) and is unbelievable.  Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood also give some excellent supporting performances.  THE WRESTLER is not a movie everyone will enjoy.  It's a very good movie, but it's also very dark, brutal, and at times violent.  There were times that a few tears came to my eyes while watching THE WRESTLER and there were other times that I was cringing in my seat and trying not to look at what was happening on the screen. Still, everything that happens in the film is so compelling that I couldn't look away and at the end found myself on the edge of my seat hoping that somehow through it all, \\"The Ram\\" would survive.y during his career, but the movie never explains what happened to his fortune.

B001IBIQU6|5.0|I love Depeche. The boys did it again with a killer cd. Get it now!!
B001IBIQU6|4.0|I write this review not just to add praise to the album (I think it's great, and grows on you with every listen), but to wonder how we find that many of the fan reviews of this album have been oddly negative, yet the \\"professional critics\\" (who all music lovers have always thought have no taste) are the ones who love this album the most. How any fan of Depeche can dis this one is beyond me. It's not like they went out into left field and produced something so earth-shatteringly different, so universally BAD, that no fan could ever wrap themselves around it. No, they made a Depeche album that sounds like a Depeche album, a little bit different than everything before it, but alike in many ways. And the icing on the cake is that Dave Gahan's vocals are better than they've been in years! Unfortunately, as with the latest, excellent U2 album, it seem to be the \\"fans\\" who dislike it the most. Perplexing! Well, I'm glad I'm in the \\"they can do no wrong\\" camp, cuz this will be giving me many years of listening pleasure like everything else they've done.
B001GM28HO|2.0|I find it amusing that Lady GaGa calls her album \\"The Fame\\" when no one knew who she was before her single \\"Just Dance.\\"  She hasn't been on the airwaves for even a year and yet has the nerve to call her first album \\"The Fame.\\"  The 2008 hit \\"Just Dance\\" is pretty enjoyable.  Think of it as a mix between Gwen Stefani and more limited Christina Aguilera-wannabe vocals.  Too many of the songs on \\"The Fame\\" sound similar.  I didn't care for her most recent hit \\"Poker Face.\\"  It kind of sounded like \\"Just Dance Part 2.\\"  I did enjoy some songs on here like \\"Brown Eyes\\" and \\"Beautiful Dirty Rich\\" but I was still dissapoined with this album.  I understand what direction Lady GaGa was going with her new album but I just wasn't feeling a lot of her songs.  I hope her second album will be better because I actually think she has potential.  Her voice is decent and her style is unique.  Here's hoping for a better second album!
B000002UAO|5.0|I had this on tape and wanted the cd. I was so happy to find it on amazon.com. Thanks
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Boy, talk about bad press.  This movie was panned by all the critics, or the great majority, but before seeing it I had only heard good reviews from friends, and I have to say overall the movie was great entertainment.  Love the setting and the story, and the great acting by the young fella.  The movie reminded me of an old classic, and they certainly don't make them like this anymore - Well done Baz for a job well done.  I've wanted to watch this again, but the only limiting factor is the movie's length at nearly 3 hours. It's not a negative, it's just that you have to find 3 hours in the day to watch it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|One of the best TV shows ever, if not the best. Very educational and awe-inspiring as you watch how beautiful the planet is and how great the vast difference of life is on this planet.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|Remastered quality is great! Lots of cool trivia in the box for hardcore Harry fans. Even a plastic police badge.  I'm not hardcore, but I still found it interesting.  I loved the DVD documentary on Clint's career, discovering surprising facts from his earlier years in showbiz.    Bottom line, if you're a fan of Dirty Harry, buy it!  You won't be disappointed.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I have been a DM fan since they were putting out albums like Speak And Spell.  I have to say that this is the first one in a while that actually reminds me of the original DM.  Ultra and Exciter were real disappointments for me.  I thought they lost a lot of the pop synth in favor of the more trendy grunge sound.  This is a return to their synth pop roots and I'm quite pleased to hear the very 1984 sound this album has.<br /><br />Great job guys.
B000000W6F|3.0|I got the album because of \\"I am one\\". It's one of my favourite alltime tracks.
B0012DOOF6|5.0|After 40 years, The Beatles' double disc collection, \\"The BEATLES\\", also known as \\"The White Album\\" is as exciting and refreshing as it ever was. The group were never any better than on this set, right here. With 30 tracks spanning across 2 albums and a running time of nearly 95 minutes, it has a lot to offer, especially considering the scope and variety of the songs which are included. Opening things is the rocker \\"Back In The U.S.S.R.\\", which has a slight Beach Boys feel to it. \\"Dear Prudence\\" is a tribute to actress Mia Farrow's sister, Prudence. \\"Glass Onion\\" plays almost like a menagerie of Beatles trivia within one song. \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" sounds as if the group is going reggae. \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" is the shortest track on the album, clocking in at under a minute. \\"The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill\\" has the texture of a children's adventure story. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is the first of 4 George Harrison tunes, with special guest Eric Clapton. \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" is noteworthy for changing tempo at least 4 different times. \\"Martha My Dear\\" is dedicated to Paul's English sheepdog. \\"I'm So Tired\\" could have easily been the prequel to \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\". \\"Blackbird\\" is a simple song, complete with chirping birds. \\"Piggies\\" is the 2nd George Harrison song, featuring his unusual sense of humor. \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" is another story-teller set to music. \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" marks Ringo's first composition on a Beatles album. \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road?\\" has a repetetive rhythm to it. \\"I Will\\" is a beautiful ballad that has a sweet quality. \\"Julia\\" is lovingly dedicated to John's mother. \\"Birthday\\" remains one of the Beatles' best rockers. \\"Yer Blues\\" is gritty and brilliant, as well. \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" could almost work as a folk tune. \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey\\" holds the distinction for having the longest title of any Beatles song. \\"Sexy Sadie\\" is another charming tune from the creative genius of John. \\"Helter Skelter\\" could serve as the first Heavy Metal record ever made. \\"Long, Long, Long\\" is George's 3rd song in this album as well as the quietest track the band ever made. \\"Revolution 1\\" is a clever mid-tempo reworking of the original recording of \\"Revolution\\" which appeared as the b-side to the \\"Hey Jude\\" single. \\"Honey Pie\\" continues the great tradition of Paul's old-style musical heritage, following \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" and \\"Your Mother Should Know\\". \\"Savoy Truffle\\" is the 4th George Harrison song on the album. \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" sounds like it could be a variation on a children's melody. \\"Revolution 9\\" is the longest recorded track released by the band, clocking in at over 8 minutes. \\"Good Night\\" is a fitting way to close this album with a charming lead vocal from Ringo. This remains the group's best album of all time. Even after the dramatic stylings during 1967, The Beatles continued to grow.
B001RTP48G|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys new album \\"Yes\\" is fantastic. Full of lush sounds, and clever lyrics, one can't help but be inspired to \\"dance like no one's watching\\" and sing along to their toe tapping tunes. I want to say that this is a return to form, as this is pure pop excellence, but that would suggest that the Pet Shop Boys have been gone - when in truth they are one of the handful of groups that I have been following and listening to for years. They have upped the ante, as almost every track on this album stays with you long after you have moved onto something else. \\"Yes\\" should expose PSB to a new generation of fans and this album is pure joy!
B000088E6D|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to this CD. I received it quickly in the mail. Michael Buble's voice is just wonderful to listen to. If you are in the mood for easy listening, or music to relax to, I would recommend this CD to anyone.
B001UE27X8|5.0|This issue combines all of the alternate takes that were previously available on three separate issues, and adds just one new alternate take that was not on those issues (the last track on Disc 2 - Who Can I Turn To). The first 5 alternates on Disc 2 were available on the 2006 reissue of the Tony Bennett-Bill Evans Album (which did not get much distribution), all the rest (except the last track) were spread across the 1999 Rhino reissue of Together Again and the 2003 Concord Reissue of Together Again. This may seem frustrating to have yet another reissue, but it pulls everything together in a more logical arrangement, at a bargain price and remastered as well. Given the presence of one of the greatest pianists ever to touch the ivories, and Tony Bennett in his \\"later period\\" peak, this is a must, even if you have the earlier issues. If you are a Bill Evans completist, there is that last track too. Nearly every singer is jealous of Tony Bennett having the legendary Bill Evans as an accompanist.
0316286850|4.0|I bought this book recently as required reading for a make up artistry course I'm doing. It's quite helpful. The photographs are awesome...full colour with great detail. It's a very good buy for any aspiring make up artist as there is a wealth of inspiration for possible creations! Aucoin is very engaging in his writing making the overall book quite a refreshing experience. Great buy at a good price. Definately worth every penny.
B000002UCN|2.0|The Beatles were an amazing band, no doubt about it, but this compilation is supposed to be the best of GEORGE.  There is no need to fill half the album with Beatles tracks; that's what Beatles Greatest Hits are for.  George had so many good album tracks that were not included, such as \\"Isn't it a Pity\\" and \\"All Things Must Pass.\\"  I would much rather have those songs than yet another reproduction of Beatles-era songs.    My advice is to pick up \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Cloud 9.\\"  Those two, to me, are the best albums of George's solo career.  And you can find the Beatles songs on their \\"best of\\" CDs.
1572816112|3.0|Online I thought the deck was too Gothic and creepy but when I saw it in person, I was drawn to it.    The back of the cards are nice because you cannot tell if they are reversed or upright form.  Therefore you're not tempted to draw an upright card all of the time.  The cards are of a slightly unusual shape where its slightly on the long side.  This can make shuffling a little difficult.  Other than that, the cards feel wonderful in your hands as you shuffle.  There's a nice sheen and they feel almost waterproof.  They feel very durable in your hands.    The cards are easy to read, even for a newbie to tarot like myself.  They're quirky in expressing an idea- but it works.  There's a lot of detail that can be missed if you're not looking for details.  For example, 2 of Cups is an awesome card.  Where a male skeletal \\"bot\\" and female \\"bot\\" are drinking at a bar.  The man has his free hand braced up against the wall, blocking in the female- such the typical bar scene!  What's more is that the garment of the male \\"bot\\" starts to wind itself onto the leg of the female \\"bot\\".  Its like entrapment, lust, a romantic relationship in the beginnings with the clock striking midnight.  What I don't understand is if there's blood at the feet of each bot or if its their drink that's spilled on the floor.    These cards speak well of the basic, traditional, tarot language with minimal editing and changes.  Which is nice, if you're looking for a straight dry read.    There is the crescent moon theme throughout the deck, always reminding you of the dimly lit scene of life, probably around 11 or 1pm where things are kinda quiet and the glow of the moon casts a different light of reality onto things.    At first the cards gave me nice precise reads, but after a while it seems like the cards and I just didn't know each other.  I don't know what happened?    If I could get consistent and accurate readings from these cards I would give this deck a 5.  But because we're not really relating, I have to give it a 3.  I think what one can do is just use your favorite deck of cards for a reading and if you want to look deeper, pull out the same cards in this deck and see what additional insights you can get.
0385474547|5.0|There are far too many criticisms being thrown at this novel. It is true, the book is written in a simplistic style (in fact it even says so right on the back cover). However, this style does not detract from the overall story. The inevitable colonization of Umuofia and other villages by European missionaries is not portrayed in such a way as to criminalize the Europeans. I don't understand how anyone saw it as a attack on a particular group of persons. \\"Things Fall Apart\\" centers around the life & culture of Okonokwo; most of the book is concerned with painting a vivid picture, though short in words, of a great warrior. It is a very good read, though the ending was not as satisfying as I had hoped. All the more reason to purchase the sequel, \\"No Longer At Ease\\". Unfortunately, I'm sure most of the negative reviews come from people are read this novel as a requirement for some educational course. If you can, read this novel with an open mind and on your own leisure (as with all great literature).
B001UE276A|5.0|Great album.  The album keeps much of the darker sound of their later albums, but has the vintage electronic sound of their earlier stuff.  It really shows that they went out of their way to get a bunch of retro electronic equipment (the box set even includes a picture showing all the stuff Gore got of ebay).      The bonus songs included on disk 2 are amazing as well, many should be album tracks.  They include more trakcs sung by Martin Gore (Jezebel is the only song fronted by Gore on the main album).       The quality of the boxset is outstanding.  The box itself is made from heavy-gauge cardboard stock and is rock solid, finished with foil lettering/graphic.  Everything fits tightly into the box, so I was at first tempted to turn it upside down to get the stuff out.  But they include little ribbons that secure to the bottom of the box that snake through the items.  You just pull up on those to get the stuff out.  Small detail, but it just goes to show the care they put into it.         The pins are indeed enamel, have a nice quality luster, and were made exclusively for the boxset.  There are \\"5 art cards\\", interpretations of the Songs Of The Universe logo by various artists in a sealed envelope.  The 5 cards are a random sample out of a total set of 14.  If you're a completionist, you're going to be annoyed at having to track the rest of the cards down.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|The movie is about this chic (Amanda) who is a huge Pride and Prejudice fan. One night while reading, she hears a sound in her bathroom, only to walk in and discover Lizzy Bennett standing in her shower! Lizzy explains she came through a door in the wall (One which was originally home to pipes and such) but when they open it this time, you see into the upstairs of Longbourne! Amanda wanders in out of curiosity, and the door shuts. She's trapped in P&P, and Lizzy is in her world.<br /><br />Amanda quickly learns she's essentially landed in the beginning of Pride and Prejudice with the arrival of Mr. Bingley in town. Amanda introduces herself as a friend of Lizzy's, saying they did a swap and Lizzy is at her house. The family takes her in, and she accompanies them through all of the events of the story.<br /><br />Amanda desperately tries to communicate with Lizzy to get the door back open (Which has sealed itself). Due to the lack of Lizzy, much of the story is being altered. Characters are falling for the wrong people, events are changing, and much more. Amanda makes and effort to influence the story to keep in on track with the writings of Jane Austen, but is overwhelmed by how badly the story has gone awry.<br /><br />I won't give away anymore! I will say this though- I laughed A LOT, and I loved the movie as a whole! It was 3 hours long, but worth every minute. What P&P fan hasn't fantasized about actually meeting Mr. Darcy??? I wish... How awesome would it be to read oneself into our favorite stories? Too cool!
B001IBIQU6|4.0|The first time I heard this I was disappointed and thought \\"What the...\\". Most likely I was expecting something more brash. But this sounds like a band that's settled into its shoes quite well, is still playing with new sounds, and still has hooks.  Yes, this album does reveal itself to be melodic...more than you'd expect. The retro-synth production is an acquired taste, and some of Gore's lyrics are clunkers ('They've heard your lies enough'?!?), but the album is intriguing, melodically satisfying, and shows that band still are stretching themselves in a positive way.  The thing about Depeche Mode is they rarely do what seems natural, or what fans would expect next. That leaves a lot of people shocked and disappointed. Take this album as it is, not as an attempt to do \\"Another Violator\\" or \\"Another Music for the Masses\\" or \\"Another Playing The Angel\\" and it's pretty darn good.

I listened to their stories, and stories they told about their parents who knew the Stalinist Terrors.  Anyone of them could have told parts of Sashenka's story, but there is so much more to be told.  Simon Montefiore has created a masterpiece.  An incredible love story plays in front of unspeakable terror and inhumanity.  I read the first two sections slowly, savoring the craftsmanship of his story, wanting to make it last, but when I reached the final section, I read it in one sitting, needing to learn the resolution.  Powerful!
1416914307|3.0|I enjoyed the first two books in this series, but I had some issues with this one. I FELT all 500+ pages, unfortunately. It seemed to take forever to get to the point of the book and then once we got there it was just okay. I was getting into the book a bit more toward the end, but I found myself thinking, geez, how many more pages do I have to go. I was annoyed with the death in the book. I felt very much that it was a death just to have a death and it didn't really add anything to the story.     I also found myself skimming a lot in this book. Clare really likes describing scenery and that's not a problem but when it seems to go on for pages then it's just too much. I never really connected with Clary either. That has been a constant throughout the series. I felt like she was just there to allow Clare to explain her world and we never really get who she actually is. Simon said she was fiesty or something like that, but I never really saw it that way. She was mostly passive and after a while I lost her completely.     I did think there were some creative things in the book. The world building, the biblical/angel details, all of that was very interesting to me. I am not familiar with alot of the things that people were saying the books resembles so I can't complain about any lack of originality. But with that said, I wasn't really suprised by anything that happened so maybe it did read like something I'd read/seen before.     And was it just me or was the epilogue longer than it needed to be? I Some of the information didn't seem at all needed. The scene with the Faery Queen was totally a waste of a page and a half. So many different pov's that didn't really show us anything we needed closure on.     All the same, I didn't hate the book, and I didn't want to throw it across the room like I did with Eclipse, but I don't see me reading it again. I will probably pick up the next book Clare releases because I do like aspects of her storytelling.
B00006JU7T|4.0|This is a fairly long film but, like Al Pacino, it's rarely boring. The name of Pacino's character, \\"Serpico,\\" has become synonymous with \\"honest cop.\\" It demonstrates what a strong impact this movie had on millions of people.    There have so many crooked-cops-themed films in the past 30 years that this film has lost a lot of its shock-and-awe. The long hair, wild clothes, beads, etc. really date this film, too, it being so early '70s in looks. It's almost become a \\"period piece\\" as if it were the Roaring Twenties except its the Hairy and sleazy Seventies.    What hasn't changed over the years is Pacino's acting, of course. There have been very few films in which he starred that didn't display his talents to the fullest. This film, along with Dog Day Afternoon and few others, put him \\"on the map,\\" making him a big star. He's been a \\"star\\" ever since.    Gritty?  Yes. Profane? Yes; Memorable? Most definitely. When you speak of modern-day film classics, \\"Serpico\\" is one of them.
B000EHSVQ4|2.0|As an avid reader of the medieval period I was excited to see that Ridley Scott was doing a film based on this subject. Boy did I have a hard time watching this movie.    The movie is about the crusades which were religious wars fought over Jerusalem, but its amazing that this movie completely sidesteps attitudes about religion of the timeperiod... If you can imagine current hollywood policital correctness set during the middle ages then you can imagine how this movie will go.     And is it any surprise that all the crazy religious nuts are christians and all the muslims are all honorable and good people that handle themselves with class? In real history there were good and bad people on both sides of the conflict.    The main theme of the movie seems to be that if you are a good person and do good deeds, then religion really doesn't matter. As a big reader of the middle ages, I don't believe the Christian leaders of this time would have ever thought this way. It would have been unthought of to think this way, or it would have been considered blasphemy and heresy.    Here are the good points;     The movie looks great, costumes look good, acting is pretty good and the battle scenes are well done. So, if your looking for a pretty looking movie with knights and swords set during the 13 century that completely gets the feeling of the period wrong this movie is for you.    I guess if your a casual fan that doesn't care about the movie getting the real point of the crusades right you might like this movie but if you want a story that is at all accurate to the attitudes of the times run far away from this film!
0792163710|5.0|This was the first film I remember seeing in the theater so it has some sentimental value. Now on DVD seeing it decades later, it certainly doesn't have the impact it did back then, but it will always be considered by me and many others as one of the great classics in film history.    These classics, particularly the westerns, were good vehicles in promoting values and definite good vs. evil stories. The evil here is personified by Jack Palance. He doesn't have many lines but he doesn't need them. His body language in this film spoke volumes, and he was one scary dude.  However, an unsung role (eighth billing in the credits) in here was the one by Emile Meyer, who played the real villain in this story, \\"Ryker.\\" (Palance was just called in at the end.) A young Ben Johnson plays a member of his Ryker's gang.    Alan Ladd, meanwhile, is the hero, the man who comes to the aid of family man Van Helflin, his wife Jean Arthur and young son Brandon De Wilde. The kid, De Wilde, steals the film and made himself into a young star with his role here. Whether feverishly chewing on his candy while witnessing Ladd fighting the bad guys or his plaintiff cries for \\"Shane!\\" at the end of the film, he made a memorable impression.    The only overdone part - as seen in so many old-time westerns - is the amount of punches people took, blow after blow, when in real life they would have knocked unconscious right off the bat! But, that's part of the genre, I guess.    \\"Shane\\" was a forerunner of many of western that copied its successful formula. This movie was so famous that a lot of newborns were named \\"Shane\\" for awhile.    \\"Powerful\\" is another adjective that describes this film - back then and still now. This story will get your blood pumping!
B001IBIQU6|4.0|The other people who bought this cd obviously were not Depeche Mode fans to begin with.  Although this is not their best CD this is a very good cd in the DM mode.  In Chains, Hole to Feed Wrong and Fragile Tension are great songs.<br /><br />LISTEN TO THE CD 4 OR FIVE TIMES BEFORE YOU GIVE A REVIEW!
0783226845|4.0|This was a different type of story with excellent acting by Al Pacino, who makes a speech at the end of the film that many people think is one of the coolest speeches they've ever heard on film.    Pacino's character, \\"Lt. Cl. Frank Slade,\\" is a turnoff for awhile because he's so gruff, but he grows on you and becomes fascinating to watch as a blind man who doesn't act like a blind man. Chris O'Donnell, as \\"Charlie Simms,\\" plays the opposite: a nice, young college kid whom Pacino winds up taking under wing.     Overall, this is a different kind of story, marred only by a little too much profanity for family viewing. If you haven't seen it, I recommend checking it out. You'll enjoy it
B001TOD92C|5.0|a deeply affecting drama. tremendous acting from Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood. the writing is just teriffic and the directing is nuanced and beautiful. this is one fantastic film.

B000VJ271A|3.0|I will admit, as I write this review, I feel spoiled. Having viewed Villazon/Netrebko in the Salzburg Festival's 'La Traviata' release on DVD, I come to this production still reeling from the other.<br /><br />First things first, the singing is incredible. Dessay and Villazon both have incredible range, they sing, they are controlled, they project confidence. The staging I felt was in keeping with the tone of the era and Prevost's book. This is France before the Revolution, the lasciviousness of the background characters, the motley crue of the elite with their predisposition for dissolution. This was illustrated well. So in fact, the overall tone (of the singing) and the tone (of the stage) were bang on.<br /><br />Despite how beautiful everything comes off, especially with the addition of the dancing and the waving of fans to symbolize the steaminess of this decadent world, there is a lack of chemistry between Villazon and Dessay. Dessay started out strong, playing the wide-eyed girl about to enter the convent before being whisked away by de Grieux's character. But when she appears later as a the bourgeois woman of the world, I felt she lacked credibility and stage presence. My interest waned and I found the remaining acts punishing to watch.<br /><br />Again, I am spoiled but I truly feel an opera's success nowadays can depend on the acting and chemistry of the leads. Joan Sutherland couldn't act, she could sing and she had a certain presence. If her facial expression always remained the same, there was still an emotion in her voice. Villazon sings and acts with heart. Dessay moving from the innocent to the femme fatale simply doesn't work. Her voice is beautiful but I couldn't feel her voice the way I could Villazon. Manon is a powerful character but Dessay simply doesn't offer what her role demands.  While Villazon comes through, his role in many ways doesn't benefit from Dessay's lack of credibility. We hear his pangs of love, we feel his heart beating in confusion for Manon but when we see Dessay's Manon, we wonder why he would feel a certain way. I felt sympathy for his character and not hers.<br /><br />This production on the surface is faithful to Massenet's Manon (the singing, the staging) but when it comes to the heart of the matter, I found it lacked.hen we see Dessay's Manon, we wonder why he would feel a certain way.

B001NY42KQ|5.0|I think this is the best of the \\"High School Musical\\" films - mainly because of the detailed dance scenes. I like the extended additon because of the special features and the sing-along. Worth the price, especially considering the regular prices in the stores.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|All I will say is that I am officially obsessed with seeing them perform live - before the end of the year!  Matt Bellamy is an musical genious that has graced the world with his talent on piano and guitar, and with his amazing vocal range.<br /><br />Even if you are only minimally familiar with Muse, this is a MUST own Concert DVD for any live music lover!
0375842209|5.0|Normally when I stubble upon a book that I love, I cannot read fast enough. I'm storming through it, completely emerging myself in a world that is not my own. Some people say that this shows a book disrespect, au contraire I'm giving this book a piece of my life that is completely and utterly theirs.       But that was not the story with this book however. This is a book to be reading to escape a for free ten minutes you find yourself having. In pieces and in parts that never cease to fully leave you when you aren't reading it. Pull out of it and continue on, and ignore the gossamer threads still spun around you, enticing you even when you aren't aware of it.     Your heart will break as you read the last chapter, tears welling in your eyes and you desperately want to put it down and say no, no. But you won't. You will read on and your heart will break just the tiniest bit more with every word that you read, and you will love every nanosecond of it. That is the beauty of The Book Thief. Devastating and elevating at once, born of the same fragile thread that you won't even realize is twine around you until you look up and see the cocoon that you're now in.     I read this after my sophomore class was learning about WWII, and I'm glad for that. The back story of these events allows you to fully comprehend the masterpiece that the author has written, it allows you to see beyond the portrait of a fictional girl and see the mural that is entire story in which she lives.     I realize that my appreciation for this book will be lost in the infinite river of praise that it receives, but I do not believe I could live with myself if I neglected to put into words the amount of love I had for this book, the book and the author deserve better than that.
B001E0FRD0|5.0|A new book as described.  Promply shipped, I am reading it now and am so proud of our military and definitely the Navy Seals!
B001N26GFM|5.0|This is a wonderfully powerful, sensitive, and painfully realistic story.  Watch it with a pack of tissues.
B00002E224|5.0|A couple of twenty-somethings -- one a French girl heading back to Paris, the other an American guy killing time before catching his plane back home -- meet by chance on a train in Austria. They get to talking and he convinces her to delay her trip, to get off the train with him in Vienna. He has very little money and was planning to just wander around the city all night, but now he has company. Naturally, before the night is over, they've fallen in love -- but not in the usual way. And when they finally part in the morning the viewer doesn't know whether they'll ever meet again or not. No sappy-happy ending here. The plot is very nicely done indeed. I don't care much one way or the other about Ethan Hawke, who plays Jesse, but Julie Delpy is perfect as Celine. She's ordinary-pretty this time out (as opposed to elegant or drop-dead gorgeous, which wouldn't work here) and sweet and very human. The chemistry between the two really works, as they stroll the streets, wander in and out of clubs, talk to a poet, listen to a harpsichord, ride the trams, and talk and talk and talk. They talk about everything under the sun, telling anecdotes from their lives to illustrate their semi-sophomoric philosophical debates. This is, in fact, the best sort of \\"talky\\" movie. It's very honest. It's also very romantic in a laid-back and believable sort of way. And you get to see a whole lot of Vienna.
B001E2JNA6|1.0|I bought this as an upgrade to blu ray of  the original version of the BBC P&P.  DON'T DO IT!  OMG, they left in the episode transitions (4 on each disk!) -- credits etc included.  It's a dvd, for heaven's sake, leave those out and let the consumer decide when to turn it off and on.  The menus and remote interfaces are poorly done as well.<br /><br />And I honestly can't discern an appreciable difference between the non-blu ray and the blu ray picture quality, even though on other movies I certainly can.<br /><br />So, I'd save your money if you have the regular DVD already.
B001IBIQU6|2.0|I've been a Depeche Mode fan since \\"Some Great Reward,\\" and my 115 Mode CDs prove my continued following. When I heard \\"Wrong,\\" I was floored...in a good way. I was hooked and believed that Mode was continuing what it started to \\"rediscover\\" in \\"Playing the Angel\\" - they could be urgent, impressive, and have our souls stomping and yearning all at once. Since Alan left, the band has had moments of brilliance (uptempo and ballads), but like R.E.M. after Bill Berry left (until last year's \\"Accelerate\\"), or the Chili Peppers, Depeche Mode seemed to be falling into the familiar trap of becoming a middle of the road, boring, adult-contemporary band who felt that their core audience didn't want to be asked to rock or dance too much any more.    A lot has been said about Mode's choice of soundscapes here, using older analog systems to create sparse worlds full of noise and voids. There are moments it's wonderful - like the chaotic, ominous machinations of \\"Wrong,\\" or in \\"Miles Away\\" - but on the whole it leaves an album that's sparse and lacking the lush production and emotional depth of their best work.    It also makes for an album that seems to cry for remixes. I don't need Depeche Mode to always make dance music - I would really dislike that - but I need to feel a beat rush through my chest now and then to bring me back to life in an album that seems to want to put me to sleep the moment you start to sink into it.    If you're looking for an album to tap your feet to or have that familiar Mode rush of driving to any number of pulsing songs with the windows down on a dark summer night, there's little of that here. Most of what they seem to be interested in are slow, bluesy songs that seem to accompany so many once relevant musicians into their 50s.    Maybe next time...maybe...
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Unlike many of the reviewers here,\\"The Snowman\\" was NOT part of my local TV seasonal line-up during my youth,nor did I see it as a child.I'm an Australian of early middle age who has never even SEEN snow.  In 1992,I was a twenty-something aspirational filmmaker who only saw the film's flying sequence as part of an animation theory class at art college.But the feelings I experienced during those few minutes were so intense & complex,& the images I saw so achingly beautiful,for years I wanted to track down a copy of the whole film.Even my comic-mad younger classmate,rather more cynical & worldly than I was,who never used superlatives about ANYTHING said simply,\\"It's so beautiful it makes me want to cry.\\" Indeed.  Well,last year,thanks to the wonderful twin technologies of DVD & internet,I finally ordered a copy.Well,it did not disappoint.Being some 15 or so years older,the joys it celebrates are even sweeter and more painful.(no,that isn't a contradiction.)Childhood's idealism sometimes seems farther away than ever.But for 30 minutes,you CAN go back in time.  Like most good art,it's based on a deceptively simple premise:little boy builds snowman.Snowman comes alive.They Have An Adventure.The rest,as they say,is magic.  The animation is flowing & lyrical,and as someone trained in animation myself I can only marvel at the many months of toil it must have taken to produce the sensitive,softly rendered drawings in coloured pencil.This is pre-computer animation,folks-all of those drawings were done by hand,and they're absolutely faithful to the source material.(Raymond Briggs' original picture book,which is a delight in itself.)When somebody argues that the time-consuming nature of animation dictates that a simplified character design is a necessity even when based on a well-known literary character(And yes,Yoram Gross,I AM looking at you & what you did to poor Blinky Bill),show 'em this film as a response.  A review of this film would be remiss without mentioning the extraordinary music,which is absolutely integral to the magic it weaves.You can HEAR the whale's tail slap the sea in the percussion,FEEL the chilly air in the young boy's falsetto,SEE the reaction of an overanxious house cat.(FWIW,there is a wonderful audio version of the story narrated by Stephen Fry,who uses the same music in this very manner to paint a vivid aural picture of the scene) Howard Blake's soundtrack is haunting & full of emotion,yet never corny or sloppily sentimental.Peter Auty,who sings the memorable \\"Walking In the Air\\"( often erroneously attributed to Aled Jones,who,had the hit single) must be given full credit for the sense of nostalgia & longing that his perfect soprano voice provides.  And yes,the scene where after the Snowman repays his young host's hospitality by grabbing his hand and flying to the North Pole (for a Snowman party,no less!) still makes me quietly weep like a tap.(At my age I can blame it on peri-menopause,so getting older has its perks.).Maybe it's the amazingly beautiful little set pieces in it-the dazzling northern lights,the majestic sweep of the whale's tail,the way the ground revolves as if in a dream,it's hard to say.Perhaps it's a return to a time when you believed anything was possible if you believed earnestly enough:I don't know.I try not to analyze it too much.But if you can watch it without turning into a puddle,you're either made of tougher stuff than I am or a card-carrying member of The Heartless Bastard Club.(Take your pick.)  For a few minutes,all the cynicism borne of the hard knocks of adulthood dissipates,and the world is a wonderful place full of magical potential.And you realise:you never REALLY forsook that idealism of youth.You merely forced yourself to forget to function in the 'sensible' real world.And when you realise it has never really left you,you cry.  Not that the film is maudlin.There are plenty of giggles to be had,whether it be the little boy's bare bum as he hurriedly changes into outdoor clothes,or the Benetton ad-like Snowman party,where large white fellows dance the jig in every national costume from the kilt & sporran & African fez to an Australian bush hat.(Well,my sister built a snowman in the Victorian snowfields once,maybe it's him!) :-).Even Santa makes an appearance.And it all warms the spirit without being trite.(After watching this film you'll NEVER be able to stomach that crappy stop-motion 'Rudolph' film from 500000000 B.C. again)  Another reviewer expressed consternation about the suitability of the ending for young souls(he melts) but having seen my sensitive 3 yr old niece cope quite well with it(\\"Where he go,Aunty Sette?\\"),I think it's a wonderful introduction to the themes of transcience & loss.Besides which,this is a film for families to watch together.Anyhoo,we don't REALLY know if he melted,do we?You can always tell your little 'un he went back to the Snowman party if their screams threaten to make your Xmas pud stick in your chest.  Joking aside,this is a wonderful film that celebrates innocence,friendship,laughter & the joys of childhood.It also could be seen as a reminder to express our affection for loved ones before they are gone & to enjoy transient happinesses without judgement.Or,it can be seen as a marvellous fantasy kids of all sizes can enjoy.  I have talked to people from many works of life,who live in varying climes,and have yet to find someone who didn't find some real value in it.(Does the lady who bought the book & griped about the ending count?)Anyhow,add it to your holiday viewing list this year & you'll have a lovely seasonal memory to cherish.  Heck,watch it any time of the year.Such a tribute to Idealism,Kindness & The Imagination should NEVER be out of season.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|First of all, I can't believe the mixed reviews this album is getting.  Some of the reviews are outrageous. Really, everyone needs to get over the past and move on.  This band will never make another Violator, so stop waiting for one. Gone are the DM anthems like, Never let me down again, Strangelove, Enjoy the Silence, Blasphemous Rumours, etc... Depeche have recorded many classics in their time.  Songs that they will always be associated with and remembered for.  This album doesn't really contain any of that.  But what it does have, to me at least, is many elements of their past work.  This album reminds me a lot of Black Celebration, and as an album, I think it is their best \\"album\\" in years. I prefer DM when they are a little more mellow.  The one thing that I am thrilled about is that there are no loud obnoxious songs on here with that dreadfull guitar and Dave Gahan screaming, like I feel you or John the Revelator.  Highlights for me are, \\"Peace\\", \\"Jezebel\\", \\"Perfect\\", \\"IN Sympathy\\", \\"Miles Away\\". One of my least fave songs on here is \\"Wrong\\".  I just don't like it.  I think \\"Jezebel\\" is gorgeous and is Martin Gore's best vocal since \\"A question of Lust\\".  That entire song, from begining to end, is perfection. \\"Peace\\" is brilliant and would be a huge song for them with the right remix. This sounds like DM's most happy song since...well, ever.    I love the analog synths used through out this album. My favorite thing about this album is the way Martin Gore sings along with Dave through out most of these songs.  I think their vocals compliment each other and sound amazing together.    One thing, I do have to agree with, is these other reviews about Alan Wilder.  He is sorely missed, at least to the fans of this band. We can hear the difference.  I know I can.  To me, ignorantly so, Martin Gore was Depeche Mode. I realize that now I was wrong. Alan did a lot of great things for this band. His work is missed and obviously gone.     So, congradulations to Depeche Mode for an excellent album.  I hope many people get to enjoy it as much as I do.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|This album flows like a river and there is not one weak track on it.  It did take me a few listens at first to grasp it, but after the second listen I was in love. And this is now my favorite Depeche Mode album so far, and I have been a fan since 1984 when I first heard 'People Are People' on the radio.       1. IN CHAINS: I love the opening, I hear a switch flipped on, baggpipes, a symphony of synths in THX proportions. Perfect way to open the album.  This song is great, it becomes what 'Higher Love' never was.... it's a sort of \\"Depeche Mode does soul and Gospel track\\". Although I can never see it being a single, it is a great opener for the album.      2. HOLE TO FEED: It took a few listens to grasp this one, I knew it was good, just was expecting something closer to the leaked Demo I had heard, yet this album version is entirely different. The demo had more buzzy synths washing over it, yet it kinda trailed off into never never land... this album version is TIGHT and ROCKS and I can hear it on the radio, so if it does become a single then I find that exciting. I would love to hear the remixes. 'HOLE TO FEED' is a song I had always visioned Depeche Mode doing, almost like an imaginary track inside my head and it came true. It's a very blues and rock type track, with it's Bo-Diddly beat, it really grabs you by the balls. I prefere this album track to the Demo.   The demos are just that to me: demos. They are unfinished songs, an idea to work on and bring to harvest.      3. WRONG: This is an instant classic most seem to agree. Great choice for a 1st single. I almost feel no need to write about it because it's so well known already. This is Depeche Mode's Rap song, complete with attitude. The crunchy synth really surprised me when I first heard it. I thought \\"wow, an electro-rap song by depeche Mode, all dark and yelling and chanting and angry and powerful\\". It is very In Your Face.      4. FRAGILE TENSION: When I first heard this as a demo version, and I loved it,the album version was not much different, except it sounds a little more polished and fuller of course. I like the electro synths on this track mixed with guitar that reminds me of The Cure, U2 and R.E.M.... or something... this is very different for Depeche Mode, it's a new sound for them, almost has a punk/Goth/Alternative energy that really works. Great track. Not seeing it as a single, but it's a great album track. faster in BPM than the other tracks. And I like that Dave sings off track, at strange moments throughout the song. What a cool song.      5. LITTLE SOUL: this is the track that made me sit up and say \\"wow, this is a great album as a whole... so far\\". It has a warm sound that is pure classic Mode, with harmonies between Dave and Martin that are blissful. What a beautiful song, and unusual in it arrangement, with it's stop and go moments, and the metal clangging in the background. What detail they paid attention to on this album. This song is beautiful, the other beauty on the album is 'JEZEBEL'. This one sealed the deal for me on this album. I think when this track comes on it gels the album together and gives it that Depeche Mode seal of approval, and it also has a creepy quality to it as well. An underlying secret, something not right, something sinister.  I love the vocals. LOVE it.      6. IN SYMPATHY: This track took me a few listens to \\"get it\\", but once I got it couldn't stop playing it. I first described it as a \\"techno track\\", with it's techno type synths throughout the song, it starts off with classic retro Mode sounds with it's 80's drum machine beats, and yet it also has it's 90's techno synths burping away. But it turns into a classic Depeche Mode dance track with almost a \\"club remix\\" feel to it, but yet again surprises us with it's chorus in classic Depeche Mode style. The end result is a catchy college radio track that could be a single, yet remains kinda almost \\"too cool\\" to be a single. It's almost as commercial as 'PERFECT' yet is way cooler in my eyes, and more dangerous.      7. PEACE: Here we go, the controvertial track that most fans seem to love, yet some find \\"embarrassing\\" because it might sound too lightweight or simple in it's lyrics and sound. When I first heard this chorus following 'WRONG' from a video at the press conference back in December I instantly knew I would love this song and it got me very excited about this album. It has classic Depeche Mode vocal harmonies between Martin and Dave. The sound is pure Retro 1984, but with an electro twist. And the chorus sends shivers down my spine, giving it a religious, Electro Hymn vibe to it. Dave's vocals are refreshing, and it's the first \\"happy\\" and \\"feel good\\" and \\"positive\\" track to come along in a long time.  This will make a classic single. I am interested in hearing remixes of this.      8. COME BACK: I first heard this as a Demo that was leaked, and I was not impressed. It did not sound finished, and kinda weak IMO. Then I saw and heard the \\"Live In Studio\\" version and was blown away. It is truly beautiful. But then I finally heard the album version and WOW! I was amazed! They took the song and balanced it out with some serious industrial and epic sounds. All the clanging metal and guitar fuzz and buzzing synths really add more depth, washing in and out at just the right moments. I still feel that this album version could easily be a hit on the radio, and a HUGE at that.  This is an instant classic track, with new sounds from the Mode.   A step up and forward.       9. SPACEWALKER: I like it. It's an instrumental, and it works on the album.      10. PERFECT: What a lovely song. Well it starts off sounding like something straight off of 'SOME GREAT REWARD\\", with it's retro beats and synths and vocals, but it rushes into the chorus that reminds me of 90's alternative rock. Think: Smashing Pumpkins or something along those lines... all college radio/alternative sugar pop, complete with guitars and pretty vocal harmonies. This for sure could be a single, all over the radio, and it is a different style for Depeche Mode, yet it works.  I love the remix for it on the Box set.       11. MILES AWAY/THE TRUTH IS: I like this song. It took a few listens to figure out what is going on in the mix. This may very well be my least favorite track on the album, yet I do like it. When it comes on I enjoy it, so that says alot about how I feel about the album. I think it adds a nice balance to the album, not making it strictly an all electronics album.  I rememebr thinking I thought it had a \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" sound to it, which I think is funny. It really just sounds like a bluesy, rockin' Depeche Mode track. There is no way this would be a single though, as some have said.      12. JEZEBEL: This is one of my favorites on the album. Simply gorgeous and beautiful. Very well sung by Martin and the arrangement is stunning.  I love the lyrics to this song. It's a classic Depeche Mode ballad. I love the meaning of this song and I feel sympathy to it's meaning. This is one of the greatest songs Martin has ever written IMO. And the Music! My god! How perfect, the way it flows and draws you in and creates an atmosphere. The synths are classic retro style, and really sets the mood. Every time this song comes on I enjoy it every time, and it is always beautiful to hear. Such a sad song, the lyrics and meaning.       13. CORRUPT: The sinister, dirty, sleazy, seductive, dangerous, sultry and sext swagger that is 'CORRUPT'. I love this electro sound on this. Very retro. When I first heard this I thought of a faster version of 'CLEAN', yet more sexy and sinister and sultry.  It's about time Depeche Mode recorded a song like this, the last time I remember hearing any sort of track like this was maybe 'SEA OF SIN' or 'DANGEROUS' or 'A QUESTION OF TIME', or even 'MASTER AND SERVANT' as far as energy goes. This is a fun way to end the album. I love it, yet I do not see it as a single. It's surprising to hear a track like thisat the end of an album. What a nice surprise.       I figured I would review the bonus tracks from the Box Set real quick:      LIGHT: Great song, reminds me of something from 'SOME GREAT REWARD' in it's feel and energy, not so much sound... I didn't like the first vocal's from Dave at first, but it has grown on me, it sounds kinda silly the way he sings at first opening, almost like a nursery rhyme, LOL, but it works and this song could easily have been on the album, as all these extra track could have. I Love This Song, a highlight for sure!        THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE STARS: I prefere this original to the remix everyone is raving about. The sounds are mystical and earthy and very old-skool retro synths were used. It gives a very natural, and organic sound to it, with the guitar licks and vocals. Martin sings well. I love the big loud drum machine beat that marches throughout the song off and on.  Beautiful. Reminds me of a summer afternoon. Wind in the trees.        GHOST: Whoa! This is great classic Depeche Mode track. It should have been on the album. It is one of the reasons to buy the box set. Classic style and retro sounds once again, great lyrics and vocals and arrangements, all dark and mysterious. This is an instant favorite of mine.        OH WELL: Another great song, this time hard-core electro. Retro sounds mixed with modern digital synths. The vocals between Martin and Dave are awesome and I do not think they have done anything like this before. I hope their next album follows along these lines. strictly electronic.   This is a dark electro song, Dark Wave as they call it. Almost sounds like a remix. They should do more like this! I absolutely LOVE IT. Classic mode with a new twist.
0739321005|4.0|Although written before Obama's political career took off, it's hard to listen to this book and not hear Obama the president. But it was the fact that this book was written early in Obama's career, before he was a guarded, calculating politician, that drew me to it. He is very frank about everything from his disappointment with his father to his drug use, from his take on race relations and search for an identity to his dealings and disillusionment with Chicago politics and community leaders. His early life would be an interesting story for any man--considering that he's now the president, it's really interesting.<br /><br />As a president, Obama is a top class writer and orator. As an author, he tends to overwrite a bit for my taste. And as a reader of audiobooks, he's so-so. He has a commanding voice, but his accents slip in and out when he does dialogue and he comes across a little stiff. Still, I wouldn't have anyone else read this book. And overall, it's a great and insightful look into a living historical figure.

Her name is taken from the Queen song \\"Radio GAGA\\" and you'll be every bit as GaGa over her and her catch tunes such as Lovegame, Paparazzi as well as the hits Just Dance and the ever popular Pokerface. She even throws in a few ballads which are not bad but it's her signature dance beats and catchy hooks that will find in your head in the middle of the night and first thing in the morning.
B0010V4TZU|3.0|When a band calls themselves something like Vampire Weekend, I expect the music to reflect the name. Some groups are aptly named like Black Sabbath or AC/DC. The name Black Sabbath tells you what you are going to get! I expected a bit more than what I heard out of Vampire Weekend's debut CD. While this debut is nice, it's not ecstatic. It doesn't bite you in the neck. It never goes over the top. It does make for a pleasant listen. It does have a consistent pop feel from beginning to end. However, if a group is going to name themselves Vampire Weekend, then please bare your teeth and spill some blood. This doesn't do that. These vampires are out for a midnight stroll in the moonlit sky. That's okay, but I was expecting that certain something extra... that never arrived.

This Lebanon born, Paris raised British citizen is Europe's best kept secret and the closest we'll ever get to another Freddie Mercury but he is in no way a replacement for as he holds his own with his self written tunes that will leave you feeling good and wonder why he hasn't crashed the American music scene yet. From his smash hit \\"Grace Kelly\\" to his anthem to the big girls of his life \\"Big Girls You Are Beautiful\\" he finds his way into your heart and head.
B0000004WM|4.0|WELL TOO MANY WORDS HAVE BEEN SPOKEN AND TO MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID SO I WILL PUT IT IN ANOTHER SIMPLE WAY: ''JUST ONE NIGHT'' ALBUM BY SAMANTHA FOX WAS A GREAT ALBUM BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DIDN'T TOP THE CHARTS BECAUSE FOR  S O M E   P A R T I C U L A R   R E A S O N   IT HAD NO PROMOTION FROM THE SINGER'S RECORD LABEL! ITS SOUND WAS EXTREMELY FRESH AND MATURE (SAMANTHA WORKED WITH THE HOTTEST GROUP AT THAT TIME, C&C MUSIC FACTORY, AMONG ALL THE OTHERS PRODUCERS) AND IT WAS SIMPLY MUCH BETTER THAN SOME OTHER R'N'B ALBUMS THAT WERE RELEASED AT THE SAME TIME BUT HAD A BETTER PROMOTION AND THUS A BETTER LUCK TO THE CHARTS....

B001TW68P4|4.0|It was a relatively short but highly successful run.  Between 1965 and 1970 a five man group from Los Angeles known as The Turtles produced some of the biggest and brightest pop records of the decade.  All told, The Turtles would place a total of 17 singles on Billboards \\"Hot 100 Singles\\" chart.  Five of these would become Top Ten smashes.  In 2009, founding members of The Turtles Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan regained control of their catalogue and decided to release a brand new collection of their hits on their very own label.  \\"Save The Turtles:  The Turtles Greatest Hits\\"  offers up 20 of The Turtles biggest hits and best recordings.  For Volman and Kaylan this project was quite obviously a labor of love.<br /><br />The Turtles came out of nowhere in the summer of '65 with their debut single \\"It Ain't Me Babe\\".  The song was written by Bob Dylan who seemed to be all the rage that year and it climbed all the way to #8 on the national charts.  Most folks just presumed that The Turtles were a folk group  and were a bit surprised that a number of the groups subsequent releases were pure pop.  The group continued to release singles such as \\"You Baby\\" and \\"Can I Get To Know You Better\\" with varying degrees of success until early 1967 when they finally struck paydirt with a tune called \\"Happy Together\\".  This would prove to be their biggest and best remembered record.  \\"Happy Together\\" spent a total of 3 weeks as the #1 song in the land.  Over the next couple of years the group would continue its highly successful run with 3 more Top Ten hits including \\"You Showed Me\\", \\"She'd Rather Be With Me\\" and a personal favorite \\"Elenore\\".  All are included in this fine collection.  Also included on this disc are several more of the groups most popular tunes including \\"She's My Girl\\" , \\"You Don't Have To Walk In The Rain\\",  and the lush and lovely \\"You Know What I Mean\\" from the late summer of '67.  As the 60's drew to a close interest in The Turtles seemed to wane.  The Turtles disbanded in 1970 but Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan re-emerged in 1972 as Flo & Eddie.  They are still performing today and have managed to keep the music of The Turtles alive for all these many years.<br /><br />All 20 of the selections on \\"Save The Turtles:  The Best of The Turtles\\" have been lovingly remastered under the personal direction of Mssrs. Volman and Kaylan from the original master tapes.  As I recall the fidelity on those original White Whale 45's that I purchased back in the day left a lot to be desired.  Great music and fond memories at a very nice price.  Highly recommended!ded in 1970 but Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan re-emerged in 1972 as Flo & Eddie.

1577314808|1.0|This is probably the most disappointing read I have had in years.  I read a lot of books and usually research them before hand.  Amazon books reader reviews are usually a good source.  But this book is an exception.      The Power of Now offers nothing new.  Anyone who has done even a minor amount of research on spirtuality and wellness knows the values of living in the moment, not dwelling on the past or the future.  Focusing and being totally aware of what is going on all around you, enjoying nature, etc, etc, its all been written about before.  What people are really looking for is how to get there, how do you do it?  This book instead focuses almost exclusively on what it is like.  The author repeatedly states the importance of letting go of your ego and yet also repeatedly mentions how very few are enlightened (LIKE HIM!).      Usually when reading books I get into a zone where I am focusing only on what I am doing, namely reading.  Ironically, this book was written so poorly, that my mind was continually wandering while reading it. His writing style is just plain awful.  He is boring, repetitive and suprisingly shallow.  I am totally baffled at the user ratings for this book.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Trekkies have been so abused by Paramount over the years, that crying about the price of another incarnation is their learned reaction. I think they actually enjoy the pain. I did not let Paramount rip me off before. I may wait until all 3 seasons are put into a condensed-packaging set, but that will be the end of the wait for this fan. I will jump on this set when the complete series is released. And Paramount did good by putting BOTH originals and re-special-effects versions out in the same set. Why did the price-conscious nerds all neglect to mention that coup de grâce, and the fact there are finally extras with a Trek set.
015204907X|4.0|My grandson and I read at least one book each night before bed. I like this book because it gives us a lot to look at and talk about. There are just enough words to create an interesting story and not so many that we can't use our imaginations to make the story our own. We can easily spend 30 minutes playing with this book and the pictures, or we can read it in 10 minutes on those nights when he can hardly keep his eyes open. My only complaint is that the colors are not really bright or definable enough. I've actually colored some of the pictures myself, so that my grandson can really see the colors the story is talking about. Over all, it's one of our favorites.
0439813786|5.0|I got this out from the library for my 8-year old daughter, but then had to buy it for her because she loved it so much!  She read the entire book in about 6 days....she could not put it down, and I caught her reading it in the middle of the night in her bed, and in the wee hours of the morning.    This is a truly unique and beautiful book, so much so that I read it myself.  I really enjoyed it too.  It is incredibly aesthetic, and the story is interesting and beautiful enough for an adult, without being too esoteric or difficult for a young reader.    I highly recommend it for anyone over the age of 6.

B00004WEJZ|4.0|Just got my DVD. The scene is there and intact.     This is a non-remastered DVD. Still in 2.0 stereo sound and with minimal extras.    The movie is great. Good to see Connery back and in charge. One of the funnest rides I've had in a long time.     If not for the aged print and stereo sound, this could easily be a 5 star product. Highly recommended for any fan of 007 or the action/spy genre in general.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|The benefit of Real Triggers isn't so much that your fingers don't slip off the trigger, although that is true. The real upside is that your grip is more balanced, easing fatigue and making all of the buttons a more confident reach. I wouldn't have bought these if I'd had to pay for shipping, but free Super Saver shipping (or two-day, if you're a Prime member), made it worth the gamble, and worth buying a 2nd set, now that I've tested the product.
B001RTP48G|5.0|What can I say?  This latest outing by the Pet Shop Boys deserves more than 5 stars.  \\"Yes\\" is true pop perfection at its finest, and the Boys haven't lost their touch in over 20 years.      You know, it amazes me how these guys continuously put out excellent music.  They are probably one of the few bands out there who remain consistent and true to their roots.  Unlike other artists (Morrissey and Depeche Mode come to mind), the PSB never forgot where they came from.      I am in total awe over this album, and it really should be the Album of The Year.  \\"Love Etc.\\" is just a perfect single.  What a way to begin this Magnum Opus...a melodious hook, great echoing chorus, and just a nice beat.  The political undertones that the PSB are famous for evoking are ever-present on this awesome track.  The remainder of the album just synchronously flows, never losing its touch.  Exceptional stand-outs include \\"Did You See Me Coming,\\"  \\"Vulnerable,\\" \\"More Than A Dream,\\" and \\"Pandemonium.\\"  Although \\"Legacy\\" is the least dancey of all the tracks, it works as a great closer.    Oh, and I HIGHLY recommend buying the Limited Edition 2-Disc set.  \\"This Used To Be The Future\\" is a great track, featuring Philip Oakey from The Human League.  The PSB made such an intelligent choice for collaborating with this pioneer of synth pop.  Awesome voice from another seminal band, and I hope they come out with a new album also.  In my opinion, the \\"All Over The World\\" mix on that second CD takes the cake.  What a pulsing rhythm!  You gotta buy this album.  I can't praise it enough, and the PSB totally deserved the 2009 Brit Award.      As evidenced on this album, the Pet Shop Boys are definitely not done yet.  They're still adding to their legacy.  Let's hope for many more years of great music from these Boys!  YES!
B0024Y7H10|5.0|This show is just simply amazing, great character development, great action, beautiful filming, and powerful captivating plots. You will enjoy this show, because it has everything you need, just watch it from beginning to end, the story-telling is a masterpiece. I've seen all the new FOX shows lately, I watched and enjoyed Fringe, I watched and enjoyed Lie to Me, and I watched and enjoyed Dollhouse, all are new shows, and trust me, TSCC is the best out of all of them.    Like you, I too was at first hesitant because of the whole \\"remake\\" idea of another terminator show, but trust me, it is truly an amazing show. It's like a movie you want to watch over and over again. I have done that with my blu-ray season 1.
B0024F08RO|1.0|I like a lot season 1 of PB, it was interesting, well-written and exciting, season 2 was a little worse but still good, season 3 was a lot worse, it was simply very bad, and this season 4 it is so bad, that I don't find any words to describe it.     Don't buy it, It is a good advice I give you, watching an entire episode of season 4 PB is really hard but watching the whole season can be a torture.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I don't believe Shangri-La is something easily defined.  I would contend that those that have blasted this effort figured it was a new Dire Straits album - it isn't.  It is something different in every respect.  I think it is definitely a cultivated taste as the more I hear this the finer it gets.  Someone reviewed it negatively here, putting it in the fine cheese and wine category - it is in many ways.  Perhaps a bit more fine scotch whisky...      I believe it to be Knopfler's best to date.
0316286850|2.0|I was disappointed with this book. Simply put it does not contain nearly enough information pertaining to technique or application. It is mostly a tribute to Kevin's artistry and the man was a true artist. However it provides little in the way of instruction or guidance when attempting to replicate these looks yourself.       The book is filled with pictures of celebrities and supermodels wearing over the top makeup, makeup that the average woman will never attempt or come close to achieving. In fact, most of the applications shown in this book are best left to true make up professionals unless you wish to look like a clown (or like you just left the MAC counter after the sales girl finishes applying every product they have to your face).    Stunning pictures of already stunning women with little instruction.

B001GZ6QBU|5.0|There are enough reviews here so there's little point in talking about the movie. I liked it. Five stars. Enough said.<br /><br />Instead, let me say you should save movie and buy the single disk version. There are no deleted scenes in the two disk version and you gain very little insight (or anything else) from the extras. Heck, go to Wikipedia or imdb and get a whole lot more information for free.
B001HN697M|2.0|Okay, so the first two UNDERWORLD movies weren't gold; in fact, I didn't like the second one at all.  But at the least first was what you expected of it: pure popcorn entertainment, with dazzling special effects, little in the way of real acting, a predictable plot, and a bunch of action (with some gratuitous sex thrown in for good measure).  It's not gonna win Oscars, but damned if it will ever bore you.<br /><br />Well, UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS doesn't bore, either...but it's never what it could be.  Or, rather, what it SHOULD be.  We won't discuss the acting too much; Bill Nighy does the best with what he's given (talk about a great actor in a limited role), and Michael Sheen doesn't even seem to be trying much (can't blame him; watch FROST/NIXON to see this actor at his best).  Again, it's nothing to lament; you didn't expect Shakespeare, did you?  We even get the gratuitous sex, the dramatic violence, even a final \\"hell yeah!\\" moment between Sheen and Nighy.  And there's definitely a good story here, the clash between vampires and lycans.<br /><br />The main default here are the special effects, or lack thereof.  This movie seems like it was made in the 80s, mid-90s at best.  It's such a disappointment; with better effects, the movie would at least have been engaging to an extent.  As is, UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS can't even seem to muster up that main prerequisite of horror/action shlock: dazzling special effects.  Without that, it's little more than a film that we WISH was better than it is.
1596912863|5.0|I first found this book at the library and loved the story so much that I had to buy it.  It's a very fun story for anyone who loves Jane Austen novels and thinks about what it would have been like to live in that era.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Here's the problem with THE WRESTLER: it is rather formulaic, following a script that, though well-written, doesn't throw the audience too many unexpected turns.  It's a run-of-the-mill drama about a washed up entertainer, the kind of story that's been made into multiple biopics and mockumentaries.<br /><br />Then why, you may be wondering, the five stars?  Two reasons.  The first is Aronofsky's filming style--it is direct and humble, \\"realistic\\" if I must use a film cliche.  It is engaging and helps draw in the audience.  The second, and most important reason you should see this film: Mickey Rourke.  In THE WRESTLER, Rourke either redefines acting, or shirks acting altogether.  His portrayal of Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson is dead-on, lived-in; it's hard to tell if Rourke is trying to be someone else, or is simply being himself.  This does have one negative effect--the stellar performances of Marisa Tomei and Even Rachel Wood go largely under-appreciated.  It's just so hard not to focus on Rourke, whose performance in this film should be standard-viewing in acting courses.  THE WRESTLER is a powerful, if predictable, film, elevated into the status of \\"classic\\" by the fantastic Mickey Rourke.  Plus, that Springsteen song ain't too shabby.

B001FBSMF8|1.0|That's right. THis album makes me wanna \\"scream\\" because of how bad it is. Carry On wasn't great but at least it had the amazing song he did for Casino Royale. After a minute I took the CD out to see if I was listening to Chris Cornell or Michael Jackson. Anyways, after 5 songs, I threw the CD across the room in disgust. Shame on you Mr. Cornell for selling out, and also shame on you for compromising your sound.

0312360266|4.0|I know people who wonder why on earth teenagers are fond of vampires, and I think a close reading of this book pretty much answers that question: the teen years are scary and confusing, as the child going through them changes and develops into an adult, and it can feel like you're turning into a whole new creature and entering into a completely different world.<br /><br />Which is just what happens to Zoey Redbird on the morning she crosses paths with a vampire and discovers afterward that she's \\"Marked\\", that the moon-shaped sign of Nyx, the goddess of the night and proto-vampire, has appeared on her forehead. She's already felt like something of an outsider in the life she's known up to this point, now she has become a vampire fledgling and she must leave her family and move to the House of Night, a finishing school for fledgling vampires. But once she arrives, she finds herself in a world almost as alienating yet inviting as the life she left, but thankfully, she falls in with a gang of fledglings who are glad to help her adjust to her new life -- and help her square off against a queen bee fledgling who's using her vampiric powers for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />I've heard people call this book \\"a cross between Harry Potter and Twilight\\", and while the Harry Potter similarities are noticeable (Zoey's family is just as critical about her going to the House of Night as the Dursleys were about Harry going off to Hogwarts), the Twilight similarities are only cursory: P.C. and Kristin Cast were meticulous to a fault in developing their vampire mythos, making it much more satisfying to urban fantasy readers who know there's more to vampirism than drinking blood and shunning the light.
B000EBD9TY|3.0|Its funny how everyone defends the movie with the \\"because of the play\\" mentality. The movie does not detail Blanche's relationship with her husband which led to her downfall. This movie is put together well enough but there are holes in the plot and characterizations which make it lacking complete coherency. Also the play's lovers speak of how the ending is different, which after listening makes more sense to me than the movie's ending.<br /><br />As usual, I judge a movie in the context of its genre. It seems people award 4 and 5 stars out of nostalgia and \\"because of the play\\". Since I the viewer really cant understand Blanche's inner demon very well, which at oft times is an annoyance, 3 stars.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|I like to look up the albums of the year, then check out the previews on Amazon until I find something I really really like on first listen.   Bon Iver, a mauling of french for good winter, has an appropriately wintry, haunted, hushed sound. Either you can deal with the falsetto or you can't. If you can, this album will creep under your skin and make a place in your soul. There's both great sweetness and great heartbreak, longing. Give it a week and watch yourself get addicted. I needed more Bon Iver after a month together, so I got Blood Bank too. It's like a reunion with my most beautiful long lost boyfriend. Enjoy.
B001TOD92C|5.0|You have to see it to appreciate that Rourke finally lives up to his early promise - and delivers the iconic performance of the decade. The Method Actor graduate of the Actor's Studio now gets his PhD (when will Lipton have him on?). Surprised that Rourke did not win the Oscar; but it was a close two-way race with his friend Sean Penn. Rourke did win the BAFTA, Golden Globe, Independent Spirit and Venice Golden Lion best actor awards. Aronofsky shows his versatility; directing a film even better than the sublime Requiem for a Dream. Tomei is fantastic and beautiful. And don't miss Boss Springsteen's soundtrack song - another Golden Globe. Check out youtube for the Golden Globe acceptance speeches; notice the only standing ovation of the night by his fellow actors.

After opening it a couple of months ago, I couldn't put it down.  I have read all the Nicholas Sparks books, and although it is not the best one, it is still a very good read.  I was inspired to read it one day when it was raining and I had nothing better to do.  I also wanted to compare and contrast Lucky One to Nicholas Sparks previous novels.     While serving on a tour in Iraq, Logan finds a picture of a beautiful woman.  The picture was not claimed by anyone so Logan began to feel a pull towards the picture.  With the picture came luck.  He won a poker game the night he found the picture, and was very lucky on several occasions.  Logan became convinced the picture is what saved his life, so he began to search for the woman.  Logan applies for a low paying position at a dog training facility.  The woman, who works there, Beth, ends up being the woman from the picture.  However, her ex-husband tries to push him out of Beth and her son Ben's lives.    One of the problems I have with Nicholas Sparks is his storylines.  The first time you read his books, they are very good and exciting to read.  However, after reading many of his books, the plot becomes repetitive.  Lucky One, in my opinion, is not one of his best books.  However, it is not the worst either.  Additionally, the book is very predictable until the end. Basically, I was able to predict what would come next, which isn't always thrilling.     On the other hand, there were very many aspects I enjoyed about the book.  The novel was very intriguing.  I had trouble putting it down because it makes you want to read more.  The novel also had a great climax and ending.  It was original, dramatic, and touching.   I would recommend the book to people who love romances and people who need a good read on rainy days.  It is also a great idea for a book club.
B000FP2Z0S|4.0|I'm really not familiar with punk music, so this is the first punk album I bought (except for the pop-punk artists like Green Day). Although I enjoy the energy and enthusiasm in live shows, I never fully really liked punk music because it just sounds like 3 chords and shouting to me.    However, what I like about Rise Against and what convinced me to buy their album was that they were able to write great hooks, thumping riffs, dynamics, tempo changes, and melodies to keep the music interesting while still maintaining the energy and socially conscious lyrics of punk music.

B001IHJ97E|5.0|I was so glad to reclaim this under admired classic. It's talented actors \\"Christopher Walken, Louise Fletcher, Natalie Wood (in her last movie, no less)\\" and such an innovative and and thought-provoking story line make me have to lable it a \\"Sleeper\\", but undeniably worth viewing.
B00122V0IG|5.0|While I always enjoyed the mystically wheezing viols of Concentus Musicus (heard them at Amherst College in the 70s), I had not caught up with N. Harnoncourt's recordings of post-Baroque music till now. What a glorious discovery! The smaller orchestra lends intimacy, reveals details, brings the winds to the foreground, yet still packs a wallop for the fortes. Add to that the fact that you pay a third of what you do for the other reputable Beethoven symphony cycles (owing to the CD being out-of-print?) and you are getting more for less twice over.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|With Viva La Vida, Coldplay has reintroduced the world to the concept album, though it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what the concept is. Its dark, militaristic lyrics (\\"Cemeteries of London\\") and electronic instrumentation render the album stark and often impenetrable, though obvious singles \\"Viva la Vida\\" and \\"Lovers in Japan / Reign of Love\\" lighten the mood considerably. The former is especially notable for its lyrical content; a reflection on kings and revolutionaries rarely tops the Billboard charts. Nonetheless, its the band's powerful instrumentation and Chris Martin's theatrical vocals that raise this track to heights above any of Coldplay's previous hits. \\"Violet Hill\\" includes powerful lyrics and a surprisingly memorable chorus, while \\"Strawberry Swing\\" is a final, breezy moment before the send-off \\"Death and All His Friends.\\" 3.5 Stars.
0783225733|5.0|Great movie.  Fast-paced, great character development, plus you get the feeling about how important (or not) the space program had become by this time.  Very interesting to see how this flight affected the family, as well as how it affected the actual astronauts.  Kathleen Quinlan as Mrs. Lovell is outstanding.
B00004ZDVQ|5.0|Stevie Wonder's Original Musiquarium I is a compilation of his best material from the 1970s, with a handful of excellent new tracks added to the mix. Classics like \\"Superstition,\\" \\"Isn't She Lovely,\\" \\"Sir Duke,\\" and \\"Master Blaster (Jammin')\\" simply speak for themselves as some of the biggest hits from one of history's most talented and diverse musicians, while \\"Do I Do,\\" \\"That Girl,\\" and \\"Ribbon in the Sky,\\" three of the songs recorded for this compilation, have become classics in their own right. There isn't a dull moment on this essential record. 5 Stars.

0525951113|4.0|Suarez has written a great novel here about a computer program that manages to take over the world. Twenty years ago this would have been considered science fiction, but Suarez makes you believe it could be true. Don't get me wrong, the computer-controlled motorcycles and other techno oddities help you understand this is purely fiction, but he manages to keep it grounded in just enough reality to make you think.<br /><br />My only complaint is the rampant profanity throughout the book. Suarez uses it so much in spots that it turns his characters into caricatures instead. You don't know anyone who talks like that, and neither does Suarez. I think it was just something to add to try and \\"toughen up\\" the book a little. It could have been cut down 90% and had a bigger impact when it happened.<br /><br />Other than that, the story is good. It continues to twist and turn and keep you guessing until the end.

B001PPGAIA|3.0|Australia was meant to be an epic showcase of the Australian countryside, love, and varying degrees of social injustice decades ago.  The result was a very long film that at times was enthralling, and at others hideously dull and tedious.  To best convey the pace and tone of this movie, the rest of this review will be in the staccato style with which Morse code is delivered, mirroring a dreadful scene at the beginning of Australia that almost made me comatose.<br /><br />English aristocrat Lady Sarah's (Kidman) husband is in Australia. Break<br />He's not making money on the cattle ranch. Break<br />She flies to Australia. Break<br />She thinks he's cheating. Break<br />Oops.  Arrow to the back.  He's dead. Break<br />Magical Aboriginal chief is suspected.  Break<br />Beautiful Australia.  Break<br />It's all good, the rugged Drover (Jackman) will work with her. Break<br />Everyone tells her to sell to the local cattle-king, King Carney (Bryan Brown). Break<br />She's a STRONG woman who won't bow-down to any man. Break<br />Half-aborigine, half-white kids are called creamies. Break<br />Introducing Neil Fletcher (David Wenham), bad guy extraordinaire.  Break<br />THWACK!!  Break.<br />Nearly all of her employees quit. Break<br />No worries, mate.  The Drover will drove. Break<br />Romanticism during the drove. Break<br />Danger during the drove. Break<br />Beautiful Australia during the drove. Break<br />More droving. Break<br />WWII. Break<br />The Japanese are coming. Break<br />Who will provide the Allies with Australian beef? Break<br />Who will take care of the creamies?  Break<br />More romantic feelings, more droving.  Break<br />Drama, tension...creamy happy ending.  Break<br />Creamy. Break<br /><br />Just like the movie, much of the above could have been edited out.  Overall, however, Hugh Jackman was stellar.  He stole the show, but a great supporting role was turned in by Brandon Walters, who played an interracial child in the middle of every single story arc (except, of course, the romance).  Kidman was average and unconvincing.  Expectations remain unmet, and only the scenery truly impresses.  If faced with the decision, I might actually fly to Australia rather than watch it again.he scenery truly impresses.

B001W63DX2|5.0|I saw this movie on Tuesday in Chula Vista with my wife.  This was our Anniversary present to each other.  This movie was awesome.  We saw three shows on Maiden's S.B.I.T. Tour, and this movie was like reliving those shows all over again.  My wife & I were headbanging to and singing along with the all the songs in the movie.  Not just us, but everyone in the theater was doing the same.  A great time was had by all!!  The last time we had that much fun at the movies was the Opening Night for Star Wars Episode III.  When the movie was over, we pre-ordered it there at the theater.  Hell, we wanted the DVD right then and there!!  6/09/09 just can't come fast enough for us.  UP THE IRONS!!!! \M/ \M/

Well worth the money.  I'm going to buy two more for other vehicles.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout - you'll work up a sweat, the moves are easy to learn and best of all, you feel like you've done a complete workout in just 20 minutes. I'd recommend it for all fitness levels.
B001AQR3E4|4.0|A great film with problematic picture and sound quality on Blu-Ray. The source transfer for \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" has obviously not been re-done for Blu-Ray, and appears to be the same source transfer used for the older DVD edition of this film. Although the superior medium and capabilities of a 1080p Blu-Ray disc make this an upgraded way to view this material, the limitations of an aging source transfer abound and call attention to themselves. Detail is good in well lit scenes, much less so on indirectly lit surfaces and shadows. Blacks are unstable and milky, and there is motion judder and blur of in motion detail in shadows. Skin tone and texture show the waxy effect of DNR (digital noise reduction). Grain appears to be tele-cine noise, more than actual grain in the original material. Bandwidth is moderate at about 15 mbs. The sound is mediocre with only a Dolby 5.1 48k mix provided. This is hard to understand, as a previous DVD edition of this film boasted a DTS sound track. All in all a better view than the DVD version. But only worth renting, or if it can be purchased used or on mark down at $10 or less. A fine film. But this Blu-Ray edition is certainly not worth $20.
0385751893|5.0|This book was able to take a heavy topic and see it through the eyes of a 9 year-old.  It reminded me that children have an extremely different point of view on so many subjects.  Very interesting and well-written; it was also entertaining and hard to put down.
159102594X|4.0|I saw Abercrombie mentioned in other reviews as a rising new author, and decided to give this book a shot. Wow. Joe Abercrombie is remarkable, and for a first novel, this is an extremely well written and well realized book. The characterizations are mostly fantastic - now and then perhaps a little over the top, and a couple of minor characters may not feel completely fleshed out, but that is nitpicking. I love the dark humor that suffuses the writing - that reminds me of Glen Cook, one of my all time favorites. Like Cook, Abercrombie tells his tale with primary characters who are all too flawed and real. Inquisitor Glokta is certainly one of the more unique and morally ambiguous protagonists I've encountered; a crippled torturer is obviously not the typical hero, and Gene Wolfe's Severian is one of the few comparisons I can come up with. Add an arrogant, drunken lout as the \\"dashing hero\\", a wizard who's an egomaniacal blusterer, and several other well drawn characters - ALL of whom get their own well voiced point of view - and this is quite an impressive feat.     The characterization is not the only well done part, either. The prose is wonderful to read; turns of phrase, Abercrombie has a real ear for dialog. The plotting is tricky enough to have some surprises but not so far fetched to veer into deus ex machina territory. A couple of things might seem that way at first glance, but are simply all part of the master plan.     The Blade Itself was so good I dashed out to grab the next two books in the series, and am happy to report that More Good Stuff ensues. This series overall is one of the best reads I've had in years. VERY highly recommended. (Note that I wouldn't recommend this for younger readers, as the writing is quite adult on several levels including psychological themes and graphic violence and sex.)
B000EYK2GE|5.0|This is just a great CD. It will get you up and moving. It is very obvious that all of the participants are having a ball.
B001RTP48G|3.0|To sum up my thoughts on this record - I thought the production was excellent, but the songwriting was mediocre.  Much of the album is made up of lush ambient synth stylings which seem to be delivered without a whole lot of personality or passion.      There is very little variety in what's here, and even less to suggest a group which is still growing.  I've heard better from PSP, so I admit my expectations were probably high.  Some of the corny psycho-babble lyrics don't really help either, but I'm not about to throw away a good album over some bad poetry.    The album starts out with an ambient pop number set to a 3/4 swing beat and morphs into the strutting upbeat pop of \\"All Over the World\\".  Lots of lush electronic orchestration expertly produced, as one would expect from this group.  The uplifting picturesque mood is maintained through \\"Beautiful people\\", which speeds things up to mid-tempo, has a nice chorus - picking up still more even in the clubby \\"Did You See Me Coming\\".  Unfortunately, the whole affair so far seems a bit sterile in it's emotive grandiosity.  There was obviously a lot of work put into the production, but the melodies are simplistic and there's very little that hits you between the eyes.  I can't say why really.  It's just my initial reaction.    \\"Vulnerable\\" takes us right back into the Euro-pop territory - which is to say mid-tempo lite pop with a simple mediocre melody and computer-tech beat.  The world does not need any more of that thank you.    More than a dream is another up-tempo dance-pop piece. Has a nice hook and some nice breaks.  Helps to recover a bit from the mediocre \\"Vulnerable\\".    \\"Building a Wall\\" has a corny hook that sabotages it to a point and almost wrecks the song.  Reminds me a bit of the 80s new wave social commentary tracks where members of the band shout things to demonstrate their passion - \\"Detection... Prevention... \\" - please.    \\"King of Rome\\" I can only describe as a typical Pet Shop Boys slow-song, but without the passion of some of their better slow-songs.    \\"Pandemonium\\" has a \\"Personal Jesus\\" style beat, but set to the same simple melodies and lush synths.    The whole album to this point is just - respectable, nothing more.    \\"The Way It Used To Be\\" - goes back to ambient-lite bouncy synth-pop.  However, unlike the album to this point, this song actually seemed more atmospheric and relaxed and drew me in more than the previous tracks.  The spartan vocals play well in this song to the lush panarama in the background.  This leads into the most interesting song on the record by far - \\"Legacy\\".  This is a full-on ambient track in the most definitive sense - lots of Depeche Mode stylings in here, which is a compliment.
1594481938|3.0|While the premise of this novel was certainly intriguing enough - four disparate individuals meet on a popular London rooftop on the night each has individually decided to kill him/herself - enjoying it hinges on connecting with the characters in some fashion, whether it's emotionally or otherwise.  Their troubles vary, but it's hard to be sympathetic for characters you genuinely don't like.  Half the time, I felt like these characters had brought all this hardship on themselves (well, not Maureen), and listening to their constant whining over their situations grew thin halfway through the book.  I liked the way the book was structured, with short sections dedicated to each character in that character's 1st POV, which gave it a theatrical quality, like each sat on a stool on a stage and when it was their turn, the spotlight would come on him/her while they told their tale.  But enjoying a story's structure and premise isn't enough to make it a keeper.  I needed to connect and care about the characters in some way to do that.  And I didn't.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|As most people have stated that this album is a \\"grower\\", I wanted to wait a few days and really listen to the CD before I gave my opinion.  And yes, the songs have grown on me and revealed their nuances.  So in the end I would still say that while SOTU is enjoyable, it falls in the same category as Exciter and Ultra - good albums that have a few great songs and a lot of decent songs, but not of the same caliber as the albums from the mid 80's to early 90's heyday.      Nothing wrong with that...there are only a handful of bands that have multiple CDs where pretty much every song is awesome.  Depeche Mode just happens to be one of them, and it's a little unfair to pan SOTU just because it's not the next Violator or Black Celebration.  The best bands grow and change and experiment while still containing songs that can appeal to the general public.  And Depeche Mode has done that with SOTU.    I cannot believe that any real longtime fan of DM would be disappointed.  There are some really great songs on this CD - starting with Wrong (an excellent choice for the lead single), a thumping cacophony of attitude and swagger that sticks in my head and is their best single since the early 90's and destined to be a big hit.    Even the casual fan will love Peace as well, a fantastic electro-pop tribute to their early days.  It's catchy as hell and is a gret foil to wrong.  A natural choice for single #2.  But its other soulful, slinky numbers like In Chains (although I can't stand the first minute of noise, I generally skip it) Fragile Tension, and Little Soul that show off Depeche Mode's versatility and growth as an artist.  It's why the remain vital as musicians even after 30 years.    Really the only knock that I have on SOTU is that some of the songs, while pleasing enough when I listen to them on their own, when bundled together have sort of a generic, same sounding quality to them...which some fans speculated may partially be due to the \\"compression\\" issue in production.Whatever the reasons, songs like Hole To Feed or In Sympathy or Jezebel end up sounding just kind of there when compared to say Wrong or Peace.  It's a minor issue (one that I had with Exciter and Ultra as well), but it's why SOTU cannot be a classic.    In summary, it's well worth my money and I look forward to blasting it in my car for weeks to come.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|These latest two James Bond films are really drifting away from what we expect from a 007 adventure.  This Daniel Craig is just way too serious and kinda dark and mysterious.  Perhaps that's how Ian Fleming wanted him to be, but in the past 40 years, we got use to more humor and some suave womanizing from James Bond.  It's really hard to care at all if this new James Bond fails a mission and dies.<br /><br />And another thing:  I think that they wanted to hurry up and get this film over with, too.  Even though it dragged, it still only ran about an hour and 40 minutes.  Most all the other James Bond films were at least two hours long or more.  For as short as this film was, it still seemed rather tiresome and endless.  Of course, it's hard for another actor to follow Pierce Brosnan because I'm sure many may agree that Pierce Brosnan was probably the second best James Bond in the industry.  Sean Connery being the ultimate best Bond. Roger Moore was pretty popular but I felt he was rather stiff and boorish.  He wasn't too impressive as a fighter, but all the Roger Moore Bond films had the best stories and the most interesting filming locations.  And, I'd even say that Timothy Dalton was a more screen-friendly favorite for a James Bond than this Daniel Craig is.  Now that I've seen this film, I don't think that I'd want to buy it.  In fact, I may just go ahead and get rid of my copy of \\"Casino Royale\\" too.  I'll just say that my James Bond library ends with \\"Die Another Day.\\"
006135323X|2.0|Another example of an interesting subject being dumbed-down and packaged in a hokey, homespun narrative.  The limited amount of real \\"meat\\" here could be condensed down to 5-10 pages.  Instead, it's printed with wide line-spacing, is often repetitive and padded with needless filler material.    You can learn a lot more about this subject by simply looking up \\"cognitive biases\\" on Wikipedia for free.    The author's smugness also grated throughout.    The only role for a book like this is a last minute purchase at an airport bookshop ahead of a long flight where limited brain power is required.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|I Love this CD. Especially the song titled, \\"The Only One.\\" It has a strainge haunting melody, fused together with Skull Blistering Metal! Clear and enchanting. This song will have you drifting off into another dimension! The female rock vocalist are awesome! The band blows you into a dimension of sound. A dimension of sight. A dimension mind and shadow!<br />Try it.
0375842209|5.0|This was a very well-written book.  Its style was different than any other book I've read and I enjoyed it.  Death has a cynical way of telling its reader what is going to happen and for some reason I kind of liked knowing what was going to happen and the suspense of not knowing when it was going to happen.  The characters will forever be imbedded in my mind.  They were all likeable and quirky!  Thanks for a good read!
B001N18HO6|5.0|I love the reissue of Ten! It is so cool. The only thing that sucks for me, is that I don't have a record player. So, I cannot listen to the Live Drop in The Park record. I'm sure it's good though. Most of Pearl Jam's things are good. Granted, I don't have all of their material. The reissue makes me think about an old art teacher I had in high school. She loved Pearl Jam. She had all of their cds and had poster after poster of them on the walls in her room. Excellent reissue! Love it!!
B000063DIH|4.0|A solid effort here with a gem - it shows that there is still some magic left.    Childhood's End, The Fugitive, Judas Be My Guide - these tracks hold up with any classic Maiden album.     Afraid to Shoot Strangers starts off slow and initially did not grab my attention but as the song plays it finally hits its stride, although it takes 2:45 to get there.     The title track 'Fear of the Dark' ranks as one of their finest songs, ever.    Weekend Warrior, Wasting Love, and 'From Here to Eternity' are solid tracks. Apparition and 'Fear is the Key' are the weakest tracks on the album, enjoyable but not up to the classic Maiden standards fans have come to expect.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Definitely one of the Pumpkin's best! Every song jams and I can listen to the whole album and feel complete enjoyment! Awesome!!

Well done Ka-Bar.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|After being used to the Xbox 360 remote for so long, using the PS3 remote for extended periods of time was not very comfortable for me.    I have fairly large hands and the position I would have to keep my fingers in on the R2 & L2 triggers was not very comfortable. After snapping on these triggers, I haven't had an issue since.    They are also the same color and texture of the original buttons which is a plus for me.    It might only be 5-10 cents worth of plastic, but they are still worth it for $5.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|The world is split into three groups of people: those who have adored Leonard Cohen for the past 40 years; those who discovered him recently (say in the last ten years), and those who have yet to find out about him.  I'm in the second group of people.    This is unquestionably a 5* DVD, but this is no fawning review.  From end to end this concert is a blast.  The songs are fantastic; the singer is fantastic, and the supporting band is fantastic.  What makes it so?  Well, aside from the quality of the songs (and that alone is worth the price of admission), the whole thing comes across as hugely entertaining, and can I say, fun.  I've never seen the man (I wish I had), but I keep thinking of Frank Sinatra when I see Leonard in his fedora hat.  Let's put Leonard Cohen up there with Frank - one of the greats!    I saw this gig live in Australia a couple of months back, and the DVD is a faithful reproduction of what I saw, then and how I remember it now.  And therein lies a problem I have with the whole thing.  In going to the gig I read various reviews and such like, each of which was glowing in its praise, and each of which regaled us with a quip that Leonard came up with during the respective concerts under review.  Live in concert, as on this DVD, Leonard came up with the same quips at the same time.  This leaves me with a mild feeling of being short changed - the spontaniety one associates with live concerts is missing.  It's no big deal, and it shouldn't impair your enjoyment of what is otherwise a wonderful event, but I offer this view in sincerity.  In equal sincerity, I believe that it is still a 5* gig.  If you have $20 left on your credit card you have to type in those numbers now.    For those of you in the latter group of the three types of people (those still to discover Leonard Cohen), this DVD is a good starting point.  If not this, then the double CD, The Essential Leonard Cohen, is well worth considering.  It offers a few songs not on the DVD (A Thousand Kisses Deep, for example) and is a great place to start.  What the heck - do yourself a favour and put $40 on the plastic - buy them both.
B001PL4HZW|5.0|It was a great purchase at a great price! Perfect way to feed my Twilight obsession!
B000001ELP|2.0|I'm really shocked at all the positive reviews posted here about \\"Elder\\"? While not a complete travesty...it's definately not a 4 or 5 star album.<br /><br />If you are looking for some early 80's Kiss, then pick up the underrated \\"Unmasked\\" or the superb \\"Creatures of the Night\\".<br /><br />While \\"Elder\\" is interesting...it's not really a Kiss album. Bob Ezrin, who produced this album, knows a thing or two about theatrical rock albums, just look at his work with the Alice Cooper's early releases, or his work with Pink Floyd. But where \\"Elder\\" fails (and I do lay most of the blame on Ezrin)is that the album doesn't capture the band at all. When listening to Cooper's \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\" album, or Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", you know without question that you are listening to either Alice Cooper or Pink Floyd, both albums capture what is so great about each band. With \\"Elder\\" anything that resembles Kiss is basically left off the album.<br /><br />Paul's falsetto vocals rob him of any power on the opening track, and he is basically a non-entity on most of the tracks.<br /><br />Gene's bass slapping is buried under orchestration, or minimized so it barely stands out. Interesting to note that the one bass heavy track on the disk \\"Mr. Blackwell\\" features Ezrin playing bass in place of Gene?<br /><br />Ace was barely involved in the recording of this disk, so while his name appears on several tracks apparently he only played on \\"Dark Light\\" and that is the only track on the disk that comes close to capturing the feel of a Kiss tune.<br /><br />I will say Eric Carr's drum work is the overall reason to give this album a listen. Though only considered an employee by the other members of the band, Carr does a stand-out job on the disk.<br /><br />Overall, the biggest regret I have the \\"Elder\\" is that the film was never made. Imagine these tunes set to a film starring Chris Makepeace? That would have made for one hell of a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode!!
0525951113|3.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about \\"Daemon\\" well not much really but I can give my opinion of the book. It was a well written book but felt like it was missing something. I read it. I liked it, but I did not love it. That being said it is hard not to recommend it...so i guess I will even though it fell short of greatness.
B001EO2UKO|1.0|I LOVE Dido's first two albums, but this is one of the most boring albums I have EVER heard, up there with R.E.M.'s Around the Sun. All of the songs seem to have about the same tempo; they all sound the same with nothing to break the monotony. There's no Here With Me, Thank You, or Sand in My Shoes - nothing I even want to sing to. I've been waiting for this album for years and all I can say is - how disappointing. She sounds bored. I hope her next one is better.

B000NA1OXY|4.0|I like Avril Lavigne because she has her own sound and writes her own material. Her voice is distinctive, and she's not out there copying everyone else in order to go along for the ride. She's unique and original. It's nice to see young artists attempting to keep rock music alive in an era of hip-hop and rap. I have all her CD's, and will be a fan for life.

B001IBIQU6|5.0|I guess when you're a great group like Depeche Mode to release anything shy of perfection justifies knee-jerk negative reviews ;)    First time listening only 3 songs really \\"grabbed\\" me: Wrong, Fragile Tension and Peace.  Next few listens the rest of the songs finally took me.  Yea In Chains has a needless 1 minute intro, yea Spacewalker is a non-vocal minute long filler.  Easy skips if you just want a single song, in the context of the whole album though they fit.  I recommend a few headphone listens and the album will grab you also.    Don't really write Amazon review but with so many needless negatives here I wanted to give this album a boost!
B000WCN8SC|5.0|Hats off to Rhino Records for putting together a box set that truly does this legendary group justice-You get all six of the band's studio releases:\\"The Doors\\" (1967) \\"Strange Days\\" (1967) \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" (1968),\\"The Soft Parade\\" (1969),\\"Morrison Hotel\\" (1970) & \\"L.A.Woman\\" (1971)-Each of the CD packages contains a bonus DVD of the group performing their material in various venues-Whoever did the audio remastering deserves to be commended-The sound on the individual CD's is far superior to that of the original LP's-If you're looking to upgrade your Doors collection,toss out those worn out LP's & purchase \\"Perception\\"-It's money well spent.

0470449748|5.0|I started GMAT Club - online MBA community; my GMAT score is 750 (49, 42), and here are my thoughts about this book:<br /><br />Strengths:<br />1. 907 real GMAT questions retired from past tests<br />2. Practice questions are organized by level of difficulty<br />3. Practice questions follow actual GMAT test patterns (it's great to have one's ear trained, esp. in verbal)<br />4. Contains a 100-question diagnostic test<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />1. Does not include any test-taking strategies<br />2. Though it has a few short review sections for each area, they are weak and very unfriendly<br />3. Questions are predominantly low to medium in difficulty which is often not representative of questions one encounters on the test<br />4. There is a 66% overlap with the previous version (11th edition)<br /><br />Contents (number of questions per section):<br />1. Diagnostic Test - 100 questions<br />2. Problem Solving - 230 questions<br />3. Data Sufficiency - 174 questions<br />4. Reading Comprehension - 139 questions<br />5. Critical Reasoning - 124 questions<br />6. Sentence Correction - 140 questions<br /><br />* Why is this book valuable/must-have?<br />The Official Guide is published by the creators of the GMAT and therefore it is the only source of actual GMAT questions representative of what you will see on the test.<br /><br />* Why is the book not sufficient by itself?<br />This Guide contains only questions and lacks insightful information about the test, a math/verbal concept review section, or any test-taking strategies. To get up to speed, you will need to get a study guide such as Kaplan Premier Program or Princeton Review's Cracking the GMAT Cat.<br /><br />* How should this book be used?<br />This book should NOT be used as a study-guide. It is a collection of questions - think of it as a way to practice your test-taking strategies but not a way to learn them.<br /><br />* What if I own a previous edition of this book?<br />If you have the 11th edition, the only difference between the two is 300 new questions, or about 30%. Most test-takers agree that 300 new questions is not a compelling enough reason to own both editions, as the 11th edition offers enough practice. If you do need additional practice questions, get the Math or Verbal workbooks instead as they each have 300 questions.<br /><br />* What is a recommended study plan using The Official Guide?<br />There are a number of approaches that work - here is one that most find reasonable:<br /><br />Step 1: Buy a GMAT Guide from Kaplan or Princeton Review. Get familiar with the test and brush up on fundamentals (math and grammar); also these books will give you a good base for test-taking and timing strategies.<br /><br />Step 2: Take a GMAT Prep (2 free tests downloadable from MBA.com) - but don't waste these; these are free but very valuable tests. Take 1 after you go through the Guidebooks and save the second one for later. These tests will be representative of your GMAT score (plus/minus 40 points).<br /><br />Step 3: (Optional - if you want a 650+ score) Get a specialized Math and/or Verbal workbook from Kaplan, the 8-book set form Manhattan GMAT and do a deep dive into the fundamentals - this is what will help you crack the test - solid knowledge of Math and Grammar.<br /><br />Step 4: By now you should have a good understanding of question patterns, strategies, and timing. Start working on the Official Guide and honing your skills - this is especially important for Critical Reasoning questions that have certain unspoken patterns and rules that only the Official Guide offers - work through the questions to train your ear. Keep in mind that these questions are on the easier side if you are aiming for 650+.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|This is a package that delivers everything promised.  The original album is a classic in it's own right.  The remix by Brendan O'Brien gives a new spin on the album without neglecting what made it so great in the first place.  The guitars are a little more prominent, the vocals are a little less muddy.  On a couple of tracks, the bass line is brought more to the fore.  But nothing's done with a heavy hand and you never think you're listening to a different record.  It just has a little different sensibility to it.  As for the DVD, I had the band's MTV Unplugged appearance on an old VHS tape, but this puts it into 5.1 and gives you a clean video.  I always wondered why Pearl Jam wasn't given a full hour on Unplugged.  I'm still wondering.  This is marvelous!
0316017922|4.0|The book has really good story telling packed with analyses, examples, and explanations largely on sociology front.  The totality of the style is somewhat lost, with one chapter offering concrete implications, and another without, and the book does not tie together as one story.  However, it does raise a few interesting points, and I will disagree with some of the reviews that the book shares the same view as the EQ book.  This book is basically founded in a theory that one does not achieve alone, and hard work and persistence do matter; and calls for a social support to help individual to achieve success by leveling the field, and by recognizing or reforming cultural legacy.  Lest not to say, I wish the book would be more thought out in terms of implications.  As a whole, it is a capturing book with a few good thoughts that are truly worth your time.
B000OHZJLY|5.0|Almost 27 years since its initial release, I find I keep coming back to this album.  I must confess, it was the 1st Costello record I bought (we're talking 1985 here) & it made enough of an impact for me to tear through everything that came before it with relish & abandon.  In short, it made a fan out of me.<br /><br />Among Costello devotees there is obviously a healthy, ongoing debate as to which albums deserve \\"classic\\" status. By & large, most agree Imperial Bedroom is on that list.  The Costello admirers who hoist their fickle disdain on the likes of \\"Man Out Of Time\\" are few & far between. The fact that legendary Jazz trumpet great, Chet Baker covered \\"Almost Blue\\" to his dying day might also make one think twice as to it's merit.<br /><br />A lot of ink has been spilled on the \\"Beatlesque\\" production, courtesy of Geoff Emerick (The man who twiddled the nobs on a little album called \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\"). But one thing that seems to set Bedroom apart from its predecessors is the fact that this is an album Costello pretty much composed on the piano, rather than the guitar.  More than anything that preceded it, Cocktail Lounge Cabaret & Rogers & Hart musical stylings take precedence over 1-2-3-4- Rock & Roll. All of which, might just account for any cries of \\"he's lost his edge\\".<br /><br />Yet, regardless of the lavish, chirpy production or the absurd \\"Gershwin\\" comparisons Bedroom received, the sentiments of the songs are as dark & jaded as ever. Here domestic unrest meets morning-after malaise. The infectious \\"insult & flattery\\" of \\"Beyond Belief\\" soon gives way to the eviscerating self-portrait of \\"Shabby Doll\\".  The best way to sum up might be: all the strings in the world couldn't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.<br /><br />Personally, I don't find a single dud among Bedroom's 15 tracks. And while, \\"Man Out of Time\\" & \\"Almost Blue\\" are usually on any given Greatest Hits compilation, lesser known greats like, \\"Human Hands\\" & \\"Pidgin English\\" need not be overlooked.<br /><br />For all its seemingly sophisticated studio trickery, Costello's liner notes reveal it actually took 3 Attractions to play the 1 accordion on \\"Long Honeymoon\\"...One to hold it in place, another to work the bellows, while Steve Nieve played the keyboard. So perhaps Punk is not dead after all.<br /><br />Despite this little footnote, Imperial Bedroom is without a doubt one of Costello's most elegant & concise albums.  I suppose a case could also be made for it being one of his most self-obsessed. But for me, he rises above the fray of his own self-conflict in a way we all can relate to.<br /><br />While a bit of a flop in its day, Columbia advertised the album with one word: \\"Masterpiece?\\"(much to Costello's embarrassment).<br /><br />For this discerning fan, the answer is simple: Yes.mingly sophisticated studio trickery, Costello's liner notes reveal it actually took 3 Attractions to play the 1 accordion on \\"Long Honeymoon\\"...One to hold it in place, another to work the bellows, while Steve Nieve played the keyboard.

B000OCY7JE|5.0|\\"After the Wedding\\" was nominated for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 2007 and is directed by Susanne Bier [whose other credits include Brothers]. The story centers on human relationships, and the tangled webs that connect one individual to another, as well as family ties.<br /><br />Jacob [Mads Mikkelsen, more familiar as the villain from Casino Royale] has devoted his time and many years to establishing humanitarian projects in India. He is told that the orphanage he is working in is running low on funds and is persuaded by the director of the orphanage to return to Denmark to negotiate a possible deal, a large donation from a prominent businessman. When Jacob arrives in Denmark, he meets Jorgen [Rolf Larsson] who seems almost uninterested in the details about the orphanage and doesn't give an immediate answer as to whether he will bail out the orphanage. Jorgen then insists that Jacob attend Jorgen's daughter's wedding, and Jacob reluctantly agrees.<br /><br />At the wedding, Jacob is stunned to discover that Jorgen's wife is Helene, a woman from Jacob's past. Soon after this meeting, the drama escalates, as Jacob begins to feel he is some sort of pawn in a game orchestrated by Jorgen. Needless to say, all is not as it seems and Jacob questions Jorgen's motives, as does Helene.<br /><br />There are plenty of twists and turns in this movie, and at times, it does appear contrived, but the excellent acting, especially by the actors playing Jorgen, Jacob and Helene, as well as the assured direction elevates this movie above a regular melodrama. There are some truly poignant moments that had me all weepy, but this is after all a drama about human frailties and the complex ties that bind people to one another.<br /><br />The DVD comes with extra features such as a 2006 interview with the director [in Danish], 8 deleted scenes,and an eight-min featurette that has a movie critic discussing the deleted scenes with the director. Total running time is 1 hr 59 mins, and the language options are:<br />Danish 5.1 Dolby Digital<br />English Subtitles<br />Spanish Subtitles<br />English Captions for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing<br /><br />Conclusion - excellent Danish drama with substance.ish 5.1 Dolby Digital  English Subtitles  Spanish Subtitles  English Captions for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing    Conclusion - excellent Danish drama with substance.
B000002H4Q|5.0|I bought this as a tape back in... 1988? 87? 89? who knows... I was 13 or so and this tape did not leave my stereo for years. Then the tape got mangled and replaced with a CD (yay technology!) and that was blasted out of my speakers for ages... until the CD died as well. Now I just listed to the mp3 of it... until my computer dies I guess.  Anyway, this CD has spanned the last 20 years of my life well. it fits my many moods, and it says a lot that I am still listening actively to this band (and this cd) at 34 years old. Still love it, and I'm sad I missed them at Coachella.  The reviewer above said that this sounds like a collection of \\"b-sides\\". you wouldn't know that unless he said it. Every song fits a mood perfectly; from poppy to angst to mellow to sad to depressed (what? the cure? depressed?) to elated and everything in between.
B0000041LO|5.0|The music in this box set is absolutely beautiful! I am a huge fan of Haydn - He really does deserve more attention then he seems to get. What hasn't Haydn written? Quartet music (check), Symphonies (104 check), Piano Trios (check), Opera music (check)... well you get my point.     I own both the Beethoven Piano Trio set by the Beaux Arts Trio and of course this one. They are both sublime - but the recording for the Haydn Trios is my favorite - seems more balanced among the three instruments to my ears.     I wanted to give this set a 5 star rating - If the music were the only factor that's what I would give it. Here's my gripe - the cheap paper sleeves the cds are stored inside-What the hell was Phillips thinking?  I mean I want to make sure my cds are pristine. Personally, I prefer the cardboard sleeves - seem more hearty to me. I know my Vinyl records (yes, I am in my 50s) are sleeved in paper. But I am more comfortable with the cardboard sleeves for the cds.     In the end, I am very, very satisfied with this 9 cd set from the Beaux Arts Trio - What a great job! Ok, I am giving this set a 5 cd sleeves be damned the music is just so beautiful! It's a 5 folks.
B000006Y4E|4.0|Pyromania was the huge break out album for Def Leppard, but High N' Dry put them on the map. Still young and hungry, the boys recorded a seriously rockin' album here. There's an energy that is undeniable throughout this entire recording, even in how there's about a split second between songs. While they went on to become even better songwriters, High N' Dry showed a huge leap from their debut and is full of some great rockers. The most recognized, of course, is Bringin' On The Heartbreak, which goes directly in to one of my all-time favorite rock instrumentals, Switch 625. The guitars sound mean and raw and the drums sound great, with lots of punch; great production, overall. The band had opened for AC/DC, the year prior to recording this, and it's not hard to hear some of that influence. Before the big ballads and huge stadium tours, five young guys from Sheffield, England straight-up rocked and High N' Dry is testimony to that. It's one of the best rock recordings from the 80's. It's almost impossible to listen to, without some head-bobbing or a little air guitar breaking out.
B001KL3GZO|5.0|this cd open my world to really nice jazz, some songs i didnt realize was from miles davis, what a great jazz artist, i really enjoy this music
B001TOD92C|5.0|This film was so sad as it depicts a has-been wrestler that has made wrestling his whole life and when told he can no longer wrestler due to his health tries to figure out where he belongs.  Rourke is so believable in the roll, and with the manner in which the movie is filmed feels like reality TV or a documentary.  I like underdog stories that have triumph at the end, that was missing in this film.  I am giving it 5 stars because sometimes in real life there just isn't a happy ending.  This movie is for adults due to violence, and adult content.  Wrestlers, wrestling fans, Mickey Rourke and/or Marisa Tomei fans will all enjoy this film.  Or anyone that needs a good cry!
1594489505|5.0|This is a beautifully moving story.  Very heartwrenching and beautifully written.  The author is one of my most favorite authors ever.  I think his writiing is important.  It is full of humanity and complex and changing characters.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|It only took one listen of this cd and I was hooked. I don't think there is one song of Keith's that I do not like. They're all amazing and every song on Defying Gravity is just as good. From his love songs to his party songs, I'm always finding myself signing along and hitting repeat! Defying Gravity is already one of my favorite albums of the year!
B00005KK19|5.0|The Wailers had been playing and recording in Jamaica for many years already. But it was their 1973 major label release on Island that brought the band onto the international stage. The Marley cuts are strong, especially \\"Concrete Jungle\\" and \\"Stir It Up\\". But Peter Tosh's two numbers, \\"400 Years\\" and \\"Stop That Train\\", are actually my favorite songs on the album. It's a shame that Tosh and Marley (along with Bunny Wailer) had to go their separate ways as they truly were the Lennon and McCartney of reggae music. Also don't underestimate the contributions of the Barrett brothers. Emphasis on bass and drums is one of the distinguishing features of reggae music and no rhythm section was more powerful than the Barretts.
1563899426|4.0|Honestly, I have read quite a few good graphic novels where I put them down fulfilled but then was in no rush to read the rest of the series. I think it's because the story and writing are good but the world itself just isn't that interesting and so I don't want to invest time in it. Fable is completely different. I've just read this first one but I am sold. I really want to know more about the characters, their history and the world they live in.    I gave this book four stars because it's very set the tone-ish. The detective story does not really give you clues where you could actually guess who the villain is in the end. It's more of a way to go around questioning all the big name people in the world so we know who they are.    I don't think you'll be disappointed when you read this book.
B001IBIQU6|2.0|Depeche Mode has always been one of my favorites, so it pains me to say this, but as I listen to this CD for the 20th time, hoping for it to grab me, I'm realizing that it's a lost cause.  I want to like it...I want to love it...I want it to stick in my head so I listen to it over and over and it just isn't happening.  Wrong is good and so is In Sympathy.  Other than that, nothing else really comes to mind.  I've tried.  Released the same day was the Pet Shop Boys' new CD, Yes...try it out.  That CD is doing for me what I wanted this one to do.
0810970686|4.0|OMG. My seven year old loves this book. It has helped get him more interested in reading and he can't put the book down now. It is wonderful to see him pouring over a book and laughing as he reads. Excellent.
B001RTP48Q|4.0|So i've always liked the PSB's, but they were never truly a favorite of mine and about 6 months ago, I rediscovered them and went back thru their catalog and was pleasantly surprised.  I picked this up the same day Depeche Mode's new disc dropped as well, and I have to say that I can not stop listening to this album.  From Love Etc, to The Way It Used to Be, they are all great.  Did You See Me Coming?, More Than A Dream and Building A Wall are my favs though.  I have to say too, that I am very surprised at how good this CD is.  I was thinking that Depeche Mode was going to take my interest away from this but it has totally been the other way around.  I highly recommend it.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Watching the wrestler I sometimes forgot that this was actually a movie. It has a documentary feel and I found myself thinking \\"The Ram\\" was a real person! This is a very rare occurrence and makes this a special film. Rourke's private life mirrors the man he portrays and makes the film feel all the more real! There are few movies when an actor gets a role at the right time to create such a character!<br /><br />If Rourke's performance isn't enough to make the film great, we have two other wonderful performances in Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood to put this film in a best picture category. Tomei's character is also heartbreaking as a stripper who's past her prime, but has still got it! I'm usually not into this style of film, but it feels so real it's irresistible.<br /><br />The DVD transfer is very good and there are some interesting extras.
B001RTP48G|5.0|Wow, I really love this disc. There are only 2 songs I don't really dig. The first song \\"Love etc..\\" would be a radio hit if any stations actually play it. The song \\"King of Rome\\" is a gorgeous slow melody. I hope some people who have not listened to PSB since the 80's rediscover them.
B001QWBM62|4.0|I'm very impressed with the HRn.  I purchased this to record my worship band & have easy access to a quality multi-track audio file that could then be easily converted to MP3 for email dissemination.  A few downers have been the lag when it starts up... 20 - 30 secs with Patriot 16GB card and frequent problems with the unit not acknowledging the card until its removed & reinserted, while on.  This might be the SD card make... Kensington may be a better choice there... never saw a problem with the supplied 1GB card.
0312383320|2.0|This book is mildly amusing.  I am really tired of  the usual three-hunky-men-want-me-and-think-I-am-cute-as-a-button.  I still enjoy Lula and Connie and Vinnie, Grandma and the three men, but...sigh -- Stephanie herself is getting a little old.  The mystery part is interesting enough.  (I'm not quite through the whole book yet.)  Carl is cute.  I think maybe it is time for a new female heroine.  On the whole, though, I am glad this book series exists and I sure couldn't do it!
B001IBIQU6|2.0|The first thing I did prior to listening was read the lyrics.  I have always enjoyed Martin and Daves prose, but this read like a bad high school drama written by young students, not \\"masters\\" of a field.  Every lyrical cliche has been played out by these two on PTA and SOTU.  I liken it to watching Twilight with my daughter when the lead vampire asked \\"do you want to see what I look like in the sun?\\"  As I was waiting for something terrific, he just sparkled...big deal.  I am an obsessed DM fan and have an extensive collection of rarities etc, but im not deaf.  This is just awful, which pains me because like so many who have written, I was a fan in my youth and now have hit middle age.  I even like \\"Boy Say Go!\\" which says so much about SOTU.  I listened to it for seven hours straight just to try and feel something, but I decided to put on Glasvegas instead. The truth is this album is miles away from good.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|Before the release of \\"Cabaret\\", Liza Minnilli was known as a curisoity by the general public: people knew her as Judy Garland's daughter who had an impeccable voice with stage presence, but she wasn't known as her own person-she was attached to the image of a daughter of a showbiz legend. When \\"Cabaret\\" came out everything in Liza's life changed: she became her own person, well regarded by film and music critics as a wonderful entertainer who could hold her own on stage and in film. She became the icon she is now known as.<br /> \\"Cabaret\\" was based on the original Broadway production of the same name. It's set in 1931 Berlin, where Liza plays Sally Bowles, an entertainer at a bar called the Kit Kat Club. John Kander and Fred Ebb, who would write the score to another amazing Broadway musical, \\"Chicago\\", penned all the songs in this picture and would become two of Liza's favorite music writers. \\"Cabaret\\" is probably one of the greatest musicals in film history, and it's widely regarded as the movie that brought back the musical to films. The picture won a total of 8 Oscars, including wins for Liza for Best Actress, one for Joel Grey, who won for Best Supporting Actor, and a win for Bob Fosse for Best Director.<br /> This particular DVD is loaded with bonus features including the original theatrical trailer, interviews with the cast, including Miss Minnilli, and extensive production notes.<br /> Liza's career went into overdrive with this film. She made the covers of both \\"Time\\" and \\"Newsweek\\", and would continue touring and appearing in film and televison projects. Two other amazing works of Liza's are her NBC special called \\"Liza With A Z\\", that is available in an exquisite DVD set, and her 1964 British special with her mom called \\"Judy and Liza-Live at the Palladium\\".
B001UW58YK|4.0|First off, im wondering why would people end up ranting, complaining about Buble not having more concerts, more this and that and place them in the review section, when it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ITEM ITSELF? do you even own the said item? if not, then why bother ranting about it? send a letter to your congressman if you'd like, and tell em about it.     Here we go...a bit disappointed, but here are the collected details about this blu-ray    Video Codec: VC-1  Video Resolution: 1080i and not P by the way  BD-25 and not the full BD-50  Total run time 120 minutes, just like the original dvd.    Audio Codecs  Linear PCM Stereo 2.3Mbps  DTS 5.1 48kHz at 1.5Mbps    Great concert, and for those who arent familiar with the dvd version, its a must purchase for any buble and/or big band act out there, for both its sonic and visual qualities.    Its a sharp upgrade from the original caught in the act dvd, but audio side is a tad softer. cleaner, yes, but noticeably lacking that 'heft' in it i was used to in the original. I could hear a difference using both formats, on a ps3 as well as a stand alone blu-ray player.    Picture quality, considering that theres only a few out there that still use a BD-25 disc compared to the better BD-50, they couldve maximized what PBS used in recording this show. Definitely couldve been better using a 1080P signal instead of 1080i.    Am i happy about it? lets just say, this ones great for a 120inch projection screen when the friends come around, and the DVD would be great for my standard collection.    Worth a double dip? only if you're planning on displaying this on a larger screen.     Solid concert, mediocre processing in my opinion. a blu-ray thats worth the price i initially paid for.

160459201X|4.0|After 50 years Power of Your Subconscious Mind is still a classic and is the book other books are compared to.  This is an important book for anyone desiring to tap into his or her powerful subconscious mind.  I highly recommend it.  The content of this book is more eye opening and motivational than it is instructional.

031606792X|4.0|I've read the entire Twilight series.  It's an entertaining book, but it does lack real character development, and eloquence in writing.  The only story line I actually was engrossed in was whether or not Bella turned into a vampire which is why I had to keep reading.  Other than that, the book is a bit cheesy and predictable.  But if you are just looking for an easy read, or are a romantic at heart, this is an enjoyable book/series.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Great job.  DVD arrived exactly as it should've.  In fact it sooner than expected.  8-D
B001TODCII|5.0|This movie hung together very well, from both a human interest and an action perspective.  After a bit of a slow start, which introduced the characters and got you interested in them, the director then ramped up into overdrive and didn't let up for the rest of the movie.  You rooted for the hero and rejoiced whenever a villain got creamed.  The suspense never let up and the ending was very satisfying.  Do real life kidnappings end this way?  Not usually.  But they should.

B000BYA5GO|3.0|Funny to read the 'righties' and 'lefties' searching for political messages and hidden agendas... PEOPLE!!!!! This movie is ENTERTAINMENT!!!!  So, with a grain of salt, realize this movie is SATIRE and BLACK COMEDY with gun running as the vehicle.    With that disclaimer out of my system, let me say, i really enjoyed the movie.  Nicholas Cage, when allowed, has an incredibly wry sense of humor.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Great job.  DVD arrived exactly as it should've.  In fact it sooner than expected.  8-D
B001TOD92C|4.0|I believed this movie.  The lack of redemption by any of the characters is true to life in most cases.  We make decisions and are bound by them.  And when we do this for long enough, there is no other path to take.  The 'Ram' said it best when faced with death... I only matter in the ring.  We all only matter when we are doing what feel destined to do.  Mickey Rourke is back and I hope we'll see more of his style of gritty acting.

0439023483|4.0|I'm not a sci-fi or fantasy lover and this book appealed to me for it's balance of realism with the bizarre world the author created. The end is a total nailbiter. Recommend for older YA readers because it's graphic in some places and images might be too much for middle graders.
0810970686|5.0|The book I read was Diary of a Whimpy Kid The Last Straw.The author was Jeff Kinney.

B000HEWEE4|4.0|I really loved that this movie was connected with Jane Austen's Persuasion.  Big Jane fan.  I really enjoyed watching Keanu and Sandra act together. I know Keanu gets a bad rap for being totally devoid of emotion or character. But this time was different. He was in character and was able to portray the love and lost important to this role. A+

0385340990|5.0|I picked up this book on a whim.  Needing a break from bleak histories of battles during the American Revolution, Texas Revolution, Civil War.....you get the picture..........I just wanted to read stuff.  Of course, I didn't realize that I would now be reading about a different conflict and a different time period.  I didn't hold out much hope that the format of letters, notes and telegrams would hold my attention.  I never put it down.  Finished it in one evening.  What a delight!!!!<br />It is interesting to read some of the other reviews.  Everyone talks about Juliet and the ones she corresponded with, but seldom does anyone mention Elizabeth who is the heart and soul of this book.  Elizabeth.  The very, very brave Elizabeth who was courageous to her end.  The only one Juliet never meets, but everyone loves and remembers.  Here is to Elizabeth.  Thank you to the authors for her and her never wavering courage.
0596522347|5.0|I started applying the techniques written in the book while still reading it. My team had to prepare presentation for a offsite that was supposed to set the context for our development over the next few years. Structuring the presentation as described in the book and allowing people to concentrate on the presenter instead on the slides we managed to make the biggest impact among the teams presenting.   This book is great practical guide for every person who plans to present in front of other people. It will teach you how to structure your slide deck, what parts are in abundance and what is necessary; how to chose colors and words and most importantly - how to tell your story.
B000001I0K|5.0|Since Lux Interior passed away 2/4/09, I've been buying all the old Cramps stuff on CD to complement the vinyl I have of the original releases.  On hearing \\"Lonesome Town\\" on this CD, I was overjoyed and saddened to hear Lux's spoken-word intro, speaking as Ricky Nelson (who popularized this song) - this wasn't included on the original track on Gravest Hits and I'd never heard it:<br /><br />Some people call me a teenage idol<br />They smile and say they envy me<br />I guess they got no way of knowin'<br />How lonely it can be<br /><br />...followed by the Cramps' incredibly sad and desolate version of this great tune.  Hearing this brought tears to my eyes.  Long live The Cramps!
1416914307|5.0|Este book es el final de la historia d \\"Clary\\", y es el final perfecto.Me encanto, es un poco predecible, porque, (SPOILER) desde el segundo libro ya se sabia que habia algo raro con que \\"Clary\\" y \\"Jace\\" eran supuestamente hermanos, pero, como ya estaba in love with the characters, no me importo. Me encanto, lo recomiendo!  obviamente tienen que leer city of bones and city of ashes!  pero, leanlo, super bueno!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I LOVE this entire CD. I bought it when it first came out and when I listened to it for the first time I really enjoyed all but 2 songs. After a couple more times listening, I became a huge fan of one of the songs I had previously not liked. After listening for awhile longer I even came to appreciate the other song so that I now listen to the CD everyday all the way through. Not sick of it yet. This album really has something for everyone though, lots of different sounds to it IMO. I can only hope his next album is as great as this one.
0920236162|4.0|This is a good, fun story for children. It can be used to talk about values and traits that we should value in others.

B00008YJH5|5.0|i could listen to this cd straight through a thousand times and still love it.  this is one of those great ones you dont ever consider skipping a track on.  i listen to this all the time.  i love popping it in while im doing a painting and i used to love listening to it driving through downtown baghdad getting shot at lol...perfect cd.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I just purchased and finished watching all 5 discs of \\"the godfather\\" restoration gift set. After reading through a lot of the reviews posted I hope that I may clear up a lot of the confusion and critical comments that may be discouraging anyone from buying this classic and timeless film of iconic characters. The 2 special features disc were very interesting, enlightening and enjoyable! I own the \\"the godfather\\" on VHS I bought a decade ago and I was under the impression that the special features from my VHS would simply be transferred to the DVD. I was completely surprised to discover everything on both discs are all never seen before features! I felt like for once a DVD that advertised never seen before special features which actually lived up to the promotion.     Ok I've been hearing some viewers complaining about the color in the film. They added a bit of a tangerine color to give the movie a more warmer and updated feel which looks good in my opinion. Some people are giving the implication that the added coloring is consistent throughout the movie and its only in the scenes where its really dark or there's lighting with a shade that gives off that particular color. If you look in the area where the light shines you'll see the tangerine color and if you look at the window the coloring is very natural as daylight would look in any window. Reviewers must remember this is a movie that was filmed in 1972 and resurrecting it I'm almost certain was a difficult and delicate process, so if this is your favorite film give the studio credit for a good job in refining a film shot with old technology 35 years ago. So for the complaints about the color, I can only say to those critics to try adjusting the color settings on your TV.     Complaints about noise, I did not hear any loud subway or train like noises that overwhellmed the dialogue, except the one scene where Micheal was mentally preparing himself to kill Solotso and that was done purposely. So again to those complainting about noise try adjusting the sound settings on your TV or maybe you got a defective copy.     I read a couple reviews about something being on the camera midway in \\"the godfather II\\". I found nothing at all that was on the camera and not a part of the film, again maybe you have a defective copy. I honestly have no criticism for this gift set and in my humble opinion this film still looks like the masterpiece that it is and I strongly recommend it to anyone pondering purchasing it!!! Also to all the other complaints I've read about the special features I think its nonsense and your expectations are far too high. I hope that my genuine and honest feelings about this gift set will serve anyone who reads this review. Purchase it and enjoy it as I have and will continue to.
B00000IREA|5.0|this is one of the greatest b-movies ever.  its goofy, sexy and surreal.  other than \\"she\\" (good luck finding it), this is my favourite.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was wonderful!  It was the perfect mix of romance and suspense.  I highly recommend this book, especially for all of those Twilight enthusiasts!
B0018SWA56|5.0|I read Something Borrowed and liked it well enough, so I went out and bought Something Blue. I was a little disappointed when I found out that this book centered around Darcy, but wow was I wrong. Something Blue is actually ten times better than its predecessor.    Something Blue follows Darcy as she goes through a life crisis, which somehow makes her more interesting than the sometimes-whiny Rachel.    One of the more interesting parts of the book is seeing the way Darcy perceives the same events differently from Rachel. But more than that, Giffin creates really realistic, interesting characters that, unlike some chicklit heroines, are totally fleshed out and dynamic. Also unlike some chicklit, she doesn't give them any easy solutions to their problems.    This was a surprisingly satisfying read. I'll definitely be reading more from Giffin.

B00006LSM3|5.0|I love this album, Rising Sun and Marwa Blues are standout tracks!    The song Brainwashed is a little preachy (though right on target!)    Very Good, and very sad at the same time!  (knowing that there won´t be any more)
B00005K1ZH|2.0|3/27/15  Just bought the sacd and played it in as sacd player - still sounds like crap. Steven Wilson, HELP!  9/20/13  I wish to God they would have fixed the awful sound of the recording in the remaster, but they did not. The out takes sound so much better than the main course, letting you know that there is a good recording of this album out there somewhere. I wish someone would care enough to release a remix. I was fooled into thinking this release would sound better. It does not. I love Yes and there are no bigger fans out there than me, but it is just so frustrating to listen to this CD. It is so tinny, harsh and distorted with Chris Squire's bass lost in a fog of low end rumble. There is no cranking this up without hurting yourself.

B001ER4CNY|4.0|I used to watch I Dreamt of Jeanine when I was young, and I've loved it ever since. I must confess, every episode is warm, funny and surprising! I would love to give it a 5 star, but the cheap cardboard \\"bottle\\" needs a makeover. Perhaps if they invest more in material, it would be more sturdy (e.g. use plastic or at least woodply) So, I'm not displaying the bottle, and keep it in the case.     I know my family enjoys every Friday night watching this series!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|The Complete Series Collection of the Gilmore Girls is fantastic.  Not only because everything comes in a fantastic package, but because the show is awesome.  The witty banter between Rory and Lorelai and all the other characters is wonderful.  This is one of my favorite tv shows because it really pulled me in, and I wanted to know what was going to happen.  Only shows that make me cry are the ones that are worth buying and this is definitely worth the purchase.
0312356854|4.0|A most fascinating but disturbing story about the atrocities to the Jews in France and French involvement.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Gran Torino is one of the best movies I have ever seen!  Clint Eastwood is a genius with his fantastic portrayal of a racist old man that you cannot help but love, this movie makes Eastwood a legend in my mind.  All the other actors and acresses were fantastic and I was in awe at how powerful the movie was.  I can't express how great this movie is.
B001SMC91M|5.0|It is impossible to listen to this album and not want to dance around.  There should be a warning on this album not to listen to it in the car, because I can't really contain myself.  I haven't seen such energy and such a fun performer in many years.  Black Joe and the Honeybears are a strange mix of funk, soul and rock and roll.  I think the reviews call this \\"garage funk\\" or \\"garage soul\\" and that seems pretty accurate.<br /><br />My favorite song from the album is \\"I'm Broke\\".  I can't get the song out of my head, but it's not a bad thing.  But \\"Sugarfoot\\" is a close second.  I absolutely love the horns.  There really isn't a bad song anywhere on the album.<br /><br />It is ridiculous to think that this is the first record from this guy.  The music is raw, high-energy and will absolutely make it impossible for you to stay in your seat.
B000DN7X5Y|4.0|This is one strange story.  The English patient is being cared for by anurse in a broken down villa in the hills of Italy in 1944 or 1945.  The war has passed by here and is being fought further on..  You become familiar with those two and their history, then a family friend of the nurse hears of her and  comes to stay.  A bomb disposal expert, a sapper, comes for the beauty of the churches he has seen and wanted to show to his friend.   The story is told as if from a distance.  You are not really intimate with the characters.  You do get to know all about them, but you just do not feel like you are being told everything.  It may be the back and forth from one character to another, from here and now (1945) to the past of one or the other person that makes for the distance you feel.   An odd point is the love of one for the others.  They each love each other for different reasons.  They are each working through their own hecks created by the war.  In the end they have all worked out their shell shock, except the sapper: he has found a new, permanent heck that no one can help him get away from.  They end going their own ways, but you get the feeling that they will always carry within themselves a bit of each other.

B002501AGG|4.0|I'm a new runner and after running the Shamrock Shuffle in Chicago this year, I think I'm addicted.  I even registered for the 2009 Chicago Marathon, I still can't contemplate running a full 26.2 miles.  But if I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do this right.  Running on nearby trails, I never really knew how far I've run or what my pace was (there aren't any mile markers).  I wanted a way to track my distance and pace.  I have friends that own both the forerunner 305 and 405, and I was impressed on how accurately they tracked distance and pace.  I researched the reviews on both, and even though I like the looks of the 405, I was leaning toward the 305 since it's half the price and the reviews were much more positive.  However, I couldn't get over the notion of looking like I'm running with a computer on my wrist.    Along came announcements of the 310xt and 405cx.  Initially, I was set on getting the 310xt because of it's large screen and waterproof capability.  However, it wouldn't be released till mid May and that model wouldn't even include the HRM.  Originally I thought the 405cx wasn't available until mid May also, according to Amazon's 405cx preorder.  But to my surprise, I found it available for free overnight shipping from the Clever Training website for 369.99.  I got mine for 314.95 with free ground shipping, so do your research and you might land a \\"premium\\" deal on this heart rate monitors in USA  ;-)    I'm getting side tracked here, I decided on the 405cx because I was hoping Garmin would have ironed out all the flaws of it's previous iteration.  I've never owned the 405 or 305, so I can't say how much better the 405cx is.  After reading the 405 reviews, a few complaints caught my attention:    - Poor satellite reception  - Clumsy bezel interface  - Locks up when sweated on  - Inaccurate heart rate monitor    1.  Satellite reception is excellent.  It's able to track satellites indoors! (though accuracy is degraded)  2.  The bezel interface, although very sexy, is a pain in my arse to use.  It's overly sensitive at times and not in others.  Lock it often.  It's going to take some time for me to get use to.  Oh well, it's the price I have to pay for sexiness...  3.  In the 2 days I've had this unit, it's never locked up on me.  I want you to know, I sweat profusely to the point where it looks like I just took a shower (I wish I was exaggerating, but I'm not...).  I don't just sweat when I'm working out either, sometimes I sweat sitting idly in a chilly room.  It's so embarrassing during meetings!  So trust me, sweating does not cause the 405cx to lock up.  4.  The heart rate monitor is superb.  This is my first HRM though, so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.  But it doesn't spike to 200 bpm or drop to 20 bpm like the treadmills in the gym do, so I'm happy.  On a side note, the 305 loves the HRM that comes with the 405cx.  The one that comes with the 305 is utter garbage, it stays at 65 bpm regardless of what you do.  It was probably defective, but it's something to think about for anyone thinking of getting the 305 instead.    This review is getting really long, and I need to get back to work.  Garmin Connect is the online software that manages all your running data.  Use it, it's hot.  Just be aware, at default all your activities are shared with the Garmin Connect online community (think of what you put on your descriptions).  I love how you can \\"play\\" your run on Google maps.  It's hard for me to explain, check out this link for yourself    [...]    Please don't make fun of my slow pace, I'm a new runner!  Here's a tip before I end this.  You can delete activities.  Just click on the red \\"x\\" next to the pencil and lock.  This was a little frustrating until I figured it out.  Good luck deciding on a watch, I hope it makes your runs more enjoyable.  It does for a gadget geek like me.

B001N18HOQ|5.0|Pear Jam is the last truly great rock band.  Their legacy started here with this album.  I don't care if it's nostalgia that causes you to buy this again for the tenth time and I don't care if you're brand new to Pearl Jam.  This album succeeds on every level possible.<br /><br />Remixed, remastered, nice DVD show......whatever the reason you need to buy this, just make the purchase.  Rock is dead, but Pearl Jam is immortal.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|This film is not particularly interesting as for the story which is that of a gangster who is captured by the police along with thirty members of his family, and decides to help the police corner the whole drug dealing system in New York, and particularly the rotten cops who are getting some kickback money for closing their eyes. It is not either the case of a clean cop who arrests all those gangsters and then turns lawyer and takes as his first client the fink of a gangster he arrested first and has his prison term reduced to 17 years instead of 70. The real point here is that this gangster is black. He becomes the dominant drug dealer in New York in the early 70s. He uses direct buying in Vietnam during the last war years and has that drug flown to him in military cargo planes, the last time in the coffins of dead soldiers. The only interesting thing here is the fact that he is black and no one can believe that famous gangster who no one knows can be black in New York, in spite of the ethnic and racial cleansing practiced by the mafia. But the film proves nothing, except that those who are anti-black racists are also anti-jew racists. Anti-Semitism goes along with racial racism. But that is nothing new under the sun. The film is well done and shows cruelly well how a cop from New Jersey has better not come and hunt on the land of the police of New York, on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge, or whatever. But that still does not make it a great film. A good film indeed but flat as for the plot.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID
B000002LLC|5.0|I never thought that Madonna could sing as a serious singer. I always considered her mostly a great Pop showwoman.<br /><br />But in fact, Madonna SINGS in this album. And SINGS OUT LOUD!<br /><br />Just sit down, relax, and go through these songs: \\"He's A Man\\", \\"Hanky Panky\\" (what a Boogie!!!!  Great song!!!!), the funny \\"I'm Going Bananas\\", and of course \\"Vogue\\".  You can also try with \\"Now I'm Following You (part 1)\\", but the overlooped sounds may distract you from listening her WONDERFUL voice.<br /><br />I became surprised to listen to this album for the first time. In an unspecified moment, somebody got it 'borrowed' from my precious personal CD collection (and never brought it back!). Luckily, I got it again for a 'super-sale' price (on a German edition, with outstanding sound quality even when originally it's an 'AAD' recording).<br /><br />Now, it's one of my favorite albums!! Hope it will be yours too!!!!

B001IBIQU6|5.0|Very good CD!!! The more I listen to Depeche Mode's \\"sounds of the universe\\" the more I love it!!!  Any true Depeche Mode fan knows they don't half-a@# it!  They--without a doubt--put a lot into this CD.  There are layers upon layers in many of their songs.  Just when you think you've got the regularity in comes a hook out of nowhere!  I love that!  That's one of the things that make Depeche Mode different.  They have a unique sound you just don't hear anywhere else.      The guys definitely made the right choice with \\"wrong\\" as the first single.  It surely made a statement and it's very catchy.  If you haven't seen the music video for \\"wrong\\", try to catch it...it was so unexpected!!  I'm wondering if there's a part two.  Another DM quality; their ability to take you there--long before you even realize where you ended up.      Some of my favorites:  wrong, peace, in chains, perfect, miles away /the truth is, hole to feed.  I can't wait to see them live in September!  South Florida lucked out during Depeche Mode's last tour due to a nasty hurricane.  Fingers crossed, 2009 will be \\"right\\" for South Florida!!
B001TODCII|5.0|Awesome movie,This movie is my new very favorite movie.A lot of the action scenes seems familar from the Born identity.But this movie takes the born identity and turns it up ten notches,But yet its more in a mystery thriller suspence mode.It takes a movie about a daddy and daughter relationship and thrusts it into high speed killing action once his daughter gets ubducted.awesome movie take my advice if you love the born identity and action movies,dont rent this movie,BUY IT.Youll love it..

0385340990|4.0|This delightful book deals in a very light-hearted manner with a serious subject, the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands, Guernsey in particular.  The light-heartedness is made possible by the fact that the narrative time-frame is 1946, after the end of World War II.  The seriousness of the time discussed--i.e. during the war--is never undercut nor the issues trivialized, but the focus is on the individuals who write the letters that make up this epistolary novel and their interactions.  And, of course, the society that was created during the war to permit the people of the island to interact and to meet after curfew, the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.
B001CDLATE|4.0|This is one of those movie either you love it or hate it.    I liked it for excellent image quality and pretty decent audio.  In some scenes, it would be better to have subtitles showing  where shot was taken.    I think this movie was shot more than 15 yrs ago?  Maybe they can do Baraka 2 and improve on few things.
0143038419|5.0|Several people had suggested that I read Elizabeth Gilbert's<br />EAT, PRAY, LOVE. . . yet<br />I kept resisting the recommendation, in large part because<br />it sounded like a \\"chick lit\\" type book that would only<br />appeal to women.<br /><br />Even the subtitle didn't grab me: ONE WOMAN'S SEARCH<br />FOR EVERYTHING ACROSS ITALY, INDIA AND INDONESIA . . . I<br />could perhaps understand why the first country was<br />there, but the other two?<br /><br />Was I ever wrong!<br /><br />This was the best book I've read in quite some time . . . though<br />based on the author's actual journey, it read like a novel . . . I<br />nearly couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Several parts had me laughing out loud; e.g., when she described<br />her signing-up for Italian lessons:<br /><br />* Studying a language is something you can actually do. So I signed<br />up for classes at one of those continuing education places (otherwise<br />known as Night School for Divorced Ladies). My friends thought this<br />was hilarious. My friend Nick asked, \\"Why are you studying Italian?<br />So that--just in case Italy ever invades Ethiopia again, and is actually<br />successful this time--you can brag about knowing a language that's<br />spoken in two whole countries?\\"<br /><br />Other parts moved me, such as when she talked about her divorce:<br /><br />* The fact that I can even write calmly about this today is mighty<br />evidence of time's healing powers, because I didn't take it well<br />as it was happening. To be losing David right after the failure<br />of my marriage, and right after the terrorizing of my city, and right<br />during the worst ugliness of divorce (a life experience my friend<br />Brian has compared to \\"having a really bad car accident every<br />single day for about two years\\") . . . well, this was simply too much.<br /><br />Lastly, I found myself reading certain passages more than<br />once--something that I rarely do--because they contained<br />such wisdom . . . for instance:<br /><br />* In a dark moment of confusion about David, I'd once confided<br />my heartache to this monk. He listened respectfully, offered up the<br />most compassionate advice he could find, and then said, \\"And now<br />I'm kissing my robes.\\" He lifted a corner of his saffron robes and<br />gave a loud smack. Thinking this was probably some super-arcane<br />religious custom, I asked what he was doing. He said, \\"Same thing<br />I always do whenever anyone comes to me for relationship advice,<br />I'm just thanking god I'm a monk and I don't have to deal with this<br />stuff anymore.\\"<br />I was so interested in Gilbert's story that I researched whether<br />she was still with Felipe, the guy she met in Indonesia . . . it<br />turns out she is, and they're now happily married in New<br />Jersey where they run an import business together.the   most compassionate advice he could find, and then said, \\"And now   I'm kissing my robes.\\" He lifted a corner of his saffron robes and   gave a loud smack.

B00012QM8G|5.0|While watching Steven Spielberg's masterpiece I am faced with a most curious dichotomy:  I enjoy watching this film; I am repulsed watching this film.  Which, I suppose, is as it should be; SCHINDLER'S LIST depicts humanity at its best--inhumanity at its worst.  Spielberg wanted to stress authenticity when he made this film, and he didn't cut any corners.  Summary, wanton executions, beatings, herding scores of naked men and women before stern Nazi physicians, hiding in human waste--this is easily one of the most disturbing movies ever.  Yet the naked brutality is essential in the telling of this story of the Holocaust; only by showing the depths of pain and despair can Oskar Schindler's selfless goodness come to the forefront.<br /><br />When we first meet Schindler (Liam Neeson, who is magnificent), he is a self-confident, playboy profiteer looking to make some serious money manufacturing goods for the German army in Poland.  Schindler is gregarious, generous, greedy, even a tad corrupt; he has no trouble making fast friends with the Nazi leadership and getting his factory off and running.  Hiring an astute Jewish accountant (Ben Kingsley), Oskar is making more money than even he anticipated.<br /><br />But then the Nazi extermination progroms are implemented.  The Jewish ghetto is cleaned out, its population shipped to concentration camps.  And we see Oskar Schindler begin to transform, from a gregarious womanizer to a humanitarian horrified by what he sees happening before his very eyes.  By bribing the Nazi officials at a nearby camp, he is able to employ hundreds of Jewish workers, thereby giving them at least a respite from the daily horrors of the camp.  And finally, upon learning the camp will be emptied and its prisoners taken to the gas chambers of Auschwitz, he and Kingsley's character comprise a list of 1,100 names--people he will take with him to his new plant in Czechoslovakia. . .people who will escape certain death.  He spends every last dime he has amassed to \\"buy\\" these workers, then laments during this film's moving climax, \\"I should have saved more.\\"<br /><br />This is one incredible film; the story is extraordinary, the acting phenomenal.  I was the most impressed by Ralph Fiennes playing the commandant of the Nazi camp sending workers to Schindler's factory.  With a cold, almost listless, expression, Fiennes is brutal, diabolical--chilling.  It's an unforgettable role for an unforgettable movie; SCHINDLER'S LIST is one of the all-time greats, and most deserving of all its awards and accolades.<br />--D.

0140032193|5.0|the novel is a great read, but i need to make a few notes. You definately need to understand, or have nearby a translator(website or dictionary), basic russian and proper english. otherwise some of the meanings of words will get lost, of course use the sentences as context for the meaning, but it helps to have it by nontheless. the russian words were put in as a political reference to communism and russian, and how the author felt it would have moved into english culture.
B000063UR1|3.0|\\"Silent Running\\" had its theatrical release in 1972 - about two years after the first Earth Day and seven years after the publication of Rachel Carson's environmental landmark book [[ASIN:0618249060 Silent Spring]].  So this movie was part of Hollywood's contribution to the blossoming of the American Environmental Movement.<br /><br />In the early 1970s \\"pollution\\" was among the top environemntal buzz words of the day.  And that's what this movie is about.  The premis is that the earth had become so polluted that plant life was no longer able to survive there (don't ask me where peoeple on earth got their food when the plants were gone), and the last surviving forests were launched into space, housed in transparent domes attached to space cargo vessels.  Then the unthinkable happens - an order is sent to destroy the forests and return the vessels to their original cargo duties.<br /><br />The protagonist is faced with the immediate destruction and thereby extinction of the last of earth's forests...what do you do?<br /><br />I believe that the message of the movie is well worth 5 stars...that is, the need to be good stewards of the earth and of its resources.<br /><br />The movie and its theme music, however, now comes across as being sadly aged and dated, i.e., painfully 1970s.<br /><br />In 1972 the three drones were the hit of the show...people for some reason really like cute, little robots (e.g., R2-D2), and they remain a plus for the movie.  The acting, however, does not rival even made for TV-movies, and the special effects now appear anything but special.<br /><br />The movie, based on the acting and technical merits, probably now rates only 2 stars.  So, on average I'd have to award this show only about 3 stars.  It's watchable, but you'll probably be happier renting rather than owning this DVD...that is, unless it holds some special sentimental value for you.
1423113497|5.0|I am a 24 year old married woman, and like many Harry Potter fans I have been reading unfufilling series after unfufilling series for the last few years trying to find something to fill that void. Percy Jackson and the Olympians is fantastic. I have to say I did like the second and third books a little more than the first. They were more colorful and funny than the Lightning Thief. Everything that you loved about Harry Potter is in this book, but not in the haphazard, copycat, money-maker way that some other series have tried (*cough cough Charlie Bone and Septimus Heap to name a couple). This is totally original and you will find yourself with the same love of Camp Half-blood that you had for Hogwarts. While this book is for children it is meaty. It has substance, thoughtful characters, interesting plots, and an intricate world I cant get enough of. I had a hard time putting the books down. I cant wait for the next book to come in so I can start right back up again. My cousin recommended this to me and I just cannot thank her enough. Thanks again Debbie!
0316017922|5.0|Malcom Gladwell is rapidly becoming one of my favorite<br />authors . . . his brilliant first book, THE TIPPING POINT, was<br />followed-up with an equally compelling second effort, BLINK . . . and<br />his most recent effort, OUTLIERS, is perhaps his<br />best to date.<br /><br />Subtitled THE STORY OF SUCCESS, it gets you thinking<br />from the very beginning about why some people succeed<br />far more than others . . . for example, I never imagined<br />that when you were born could affect whether you'd be<br />a success in sports or even in school . . . but as the author notes:<br /><br />* Hockey and soccer are just games, of course, involving a select few.<br />But these exact same biases also show up in areas of much more<br />consequences, like education. Parents with a child born at the end<br />of the calendar often think about holding their child back before the<br />start of kindergarten: it's hard for a five-year-old to keep up with a child<br />born many months earlier. But most parents, one suspects, think that<br />whatever disadvantage a younger child faces in kindergarten eventually<br />goes away. But it doesn't. It's just like hockey. The small initial<br />advantage that the child born in the early part of the year has over the child<br />born at the end of the year persists. It locks children into patterns<br />of achievement and underachievement, encouragement and<br />discouragement, that stretch on and on for years.<br /><br />Gladwell then goes on to dissect the greatness of pro athletes<br />and entertainers, explaining that while it is important to have<br />natural ability, much  hard work is every bit as important:<br /><br />* The Beatles ended up traveling to Hamburg five times between 1960<br />and the end of 1962. On the first trip, they played 106 nights, five or more<br />hours a night. On their second trip, they played 92 times. On their third<br />trip, they played 48 times, for a total of 171 hours on stage. The last two<br />Hamburg gigs, in November and December of 1962, involved another 90<br />hours of performing. All told, they performed for 270 nights in just over<br />a year and a half. By the time they had their first burst of success in 1964, in<br />fact, they had performed live an estimated twelve hundred times. Do you<br />know how extraordinary that is? Most bands today don't perform twelve<br />hundred in their entire careers. The Hamburg crucible is one of the things<br />that set the Beatles apart.<br /><br />And when it comes to success in mathematics, Gladwell contends that<br />we need to revisit out entire thinking about schooling in America:<br /><br />* Suddenly the causes of Asian math superiority become even more obvious.<br />Students in Asian schools don't have long summer vacations. Why would<br />they? Cultures that believe that the route to success lies in rising before<br />dawn 360 days a year are scarcely going to give their children three straight<br />months off in the summer.

B001N18HOQ|5.0|Ok, I have been a Pearl Jam fan for ages, since 1992 I bought every Pearl Jam record I could find. This re-edition of Ten is great. For a very low price you got 2 cds and a DVD. The packaging is beautiful, is a sort of little book with pictures from the time Ten was recorded. You got the original Ten, the remixed version of the album and the dvd of the famous unplugged played in 1992.  Of all the versions available I think this is the best, the super deluxe would be a great choice if you're a collector but the price is a little high. So if you want the best price/value relation this version is the way to go.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|First of all, I know that there are people out there that think that this movie is the absolute greatest.  It does appeal to many of the senses, but in my opinion, it lacks the makings of a classic movie.  It, however, may qualify as a sort of cult classic, but not a movie classic.<br /><br />The acting is clearly back-seated to many beautiful cars, hip music, and, surprisingly, big-name actors (e.g., Cage, Jolie, Duvall).  I found the storyline to be quite predictable, as was the outcome.<br /><br />You know the drill...there is an evil bad guy and developments endanger a family member of a good bad guy, thus forcing the good bad guy to bow to the evil bad guy far enough to try to save the other family member.  There is also a street-wise cop that has a history with the good bad guy, but their interactions exist primarily to provide a situation for a high speed chase that is included in the movie mainly to total as many cars of as many innocent drivers as possible.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong...this kind of action movie is amazing...it's got plenty of, well, ACTION. If that's what you are after, \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" will give it to you.<br /><br />If you are, however, looking for character development, a story you could watch again and again, and more that digital candy, then this movie is probably not for you.<br /><br />For those reasons I give this movie 3 stars.  You'll probably enjoy watching it, but when you're done there's, alas, not much reason to watch it again.<br /><br />3 stars...fun action, but it's quite predictable and then forgetable.

0061119725|5.0|This is my 14 month old's favorite book.  It is a real joy to watch her learn these movements.  It started at around 10 months with the hand clapping, and now she's bending her neck, wriggling her hips, stomping her feet, and just last week she started raising her shoulders.  I plan to make this a staple birthday gift for 1 and 2 year olds.  As many reviews suggest, this can be a favorite for many years.  You truly can't go wrong with this one!  I should note that we have the board book version which is great for the younger page-tearing set.
0880389052|3.0|I promise not to spoil anything in this review. My goal is to help you decide whether or not you should read it.    This book is littered with dark, evil happenings. You spend every chapter of this book amidst evil slayings, murders, and cruel events. The author certainly has no problems denying the reader a happy conclusion to every event. There is no comic relief to break the intensity. If you can bare that, and if you are looking for a fun adventure story rather than a philosophical endeavor, then this book is surely for you.    The ongoing unhappiness in this book was the only thing that bothered me; sometimes I would need to stop reading and go do something fun to cheer myself back up. Other than that, it was fun to get into this truly evil underground city and see what it's like!    Salvatore truly paints a clear picture into your mind, of this abstract and magical underground realm! Well written.    I subtract 2 stars. -1 for SO much unhappiness in the book without any comic relief to break it up, and -1 because there were several times that the author really makes you want something, and it just doesn't happen, leaving you unsatisfied several times.

0385340990|4.0|What a nice story, told in part through letter exchanges between old friends and new friends. Much of the book's setting is on the isle of Guernsey during the occupation by the Germans in WWII.  It's so refreshing to read a book where, in spite of rough times, people are survivors and care for one another......mostly. The author uses wonderful themes to tie the story together; the letter exchanges, the power of books in one's lives, mystery and intrigue, compassion, friendship, humor and the loving capacity of the human heart.

B001E2JNA6|5.0|This review is of the Blu-ray version of this classic film.  If you're reading this, you probably already love this adaption, but might be wondering why Blu-ray.  Here's my answer:<br /><br />I've been a fan of the BBC's 1995 version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" for at least 10 years now, and have owned the mini-series on both VHS tape and DVD.  When I saw that a Blu-ray version of the film was being released, my first thought was why would I want this film, which has always looked like poor quality TV at best, or downright grainy at worst, on Blu-ray, which you buy for films with a high level of visual detail?  But then I started researching what had gone into the production of the Blu-ray disc, including a full restoration of the film and a new transfer from the 16mm film.  I looked at stills online which showed the difference between the DVD and Blu-ray versions--generally a clearer picture and brighter colors--and I was convinced that it would be worth trying this version.<br /><br />After watching the entire miniseries on Blu-ray, I am shocked at how good this film looks after the restoration.  It's no longer the grainy, dull colors production that you're used to seeing.  My husband walked in while I was watching it, and thought that this must actually be a new production because it looked so crisp.  This is hands down the BEST presentation of this classic I have ever seen, so if you're a fan and you have access to a Blu-ray player, do yourself a favor and upgrade.  It's totally worth it to see the film as it was originally intended to look--making a great movie absolutely gorgeous.
B000FC1192|5.0|Question:  What would you get if Alice Liddell married Jack Skellington?<br /><br />Answer:  CORALINE<br /><br />CORALINE is a deliciously creepy odyssey which starts with a young girl's boredom and ends with her being appreciative of her own backyard. Figuratively and literally. It is a well-told tale reminiscent of Through the Looking Glass, The Wizard of Oz, and Hansel and Gretel. What I particularly liked about the tale was that CORALINE's parents are alive and remain so from beginning to end. Yeah for living parents!<br /><br />When first we see CORALINE(not Caroline, as she has to remind folks), she's bored. She lives in an apartment with her mother and father, both of whom work from home but can't give her the attention she craves. She tries visiting the old Vaudevillian ladies who live upstairs as well as the crazy old man who trains the mice, but she just doesn't understand them. Huh. Then she finds the key and the door, and the passage beyond that's sometimes there and sometimes not. The old man says that the mice have a message for her: don't enter the passage. If only CORALINE had listened.<br /><br />What CORALINE finds beyond that passageway is what makes this story interesting. It's what makes all classic fairytales interesting. Temptation, morality, determination, and heroism, all wrapped up like a spooky burrito with a side order of eerie dipping sauce.<br /><br />The story is nicely edited, keeping the reader turning pages and wanting to know what happens next. In fact, once I finished the book, I went looking for the movie. Unfortunately, it has already left theaters and not yet made it to store shelves. I'll just have to keep my button-eyes peeled for it!

B0036EH3U2|5.0|Im writing this review on the series and not specifically the Blu-Ray release (as I have not seen the product myself). Of all the shows and series Ive watched over the years, this is by and far one of (if not THE) best I have seen. Its a wonderful series start to finish, even if you didnt end up quite where you thought you would in the beginning. One of the best things about this show was that its a great character study of the human condition. The story truly transcends being a \\"scifi\\" show and becomes something much more. Even my girlfriend (who tends to dislike scifi simply for being scifi) ended up loving this show. This is a must see series.     And if all that wasnt enough of a reason to watch it, the series finale was. Rarely does a series with this much following end in a truly satisfying manner. It may not have ended exactly as I had hoped, but the quality and depth of storytelling in the finale MORE than overcomes any disagreement in the end of the story. I cant say that Ive ever actually enjoyed a series finale before this one, and this one was so good I actually was ok with the show ending. All in all 5 stars isnt enough of a rating for this series.     The addition of The Plan to this collection fixes the complaint I had about the original release of the \\"complete series\\" as it hadnt even aired at that time.  Ive read a number of complaints about how \\"unwieldy\\" the box is to this set, but from what Ive seen it isnt any bigger or ungainly than the boxes for other collections like The Matrix trilogy, Band of Brothers, Rome, or Generation Kill.  In some ways thats neither here nor there, but I thought I would point it out.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Another stellar performance by Diana and her group.  Love it.  Ron Pearson, Venice FL USA
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Modern psychedelic classic-rock feel. Vivid, meaningful lyrics, excellent structure and soloing. Highly recommended for fans of the genre.
0739368435|5.0|I just loved this audiobook.  There are five narrators who really bring these characters to life.  I have bought four copies to give as gifts, and I am sure I will buy more.  This really is one of the best audiobooks I have ever heard.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this dvd!  I have been doing this workout for about a month, almost everyday with 10 days on each level.  I am on day 5 of level 3.  My legs and arms are so much smaller than what they were when I started and I actually have visable muscles in my arms now.  My stomach muscles have gotten so much stronger and I have lost inches all over.  I've lost about 10lbs so far, but I feel and look like I have lost way more than that because I have lost so many inches.  This is such a great workout.  Highly recommend!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian will kick your butt! This 20 min workout is awesome! It keeps you entertained the whole time!
B00081912E|3.0|I bought this base on my memories of having enjoyed it back when it was first released and, to be honest, it hasn't held up quite as well as I thought it would.      Jim Carrey is brilliant!  He really \\"gets\\" the whole cartoon comedy aspect of his character \\"The Mask\\" but the story is very, very weak and, surprisingly, is a bit of a drag to sit through.    Overall, it's still a funny film but not a classic.  Thanks goodness they had Jim Carrey on board or the film might have fallen flat on its face.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|What a beautiful movie.  The Australia scenery is spectacular.  Hugh and Nicole make a super couple.  Very moving story with great history. This is one I will rewatch again and again.
B00164KYV4|4.0|I really wanted to see this movie. I did briefly peruse the book, though I personally never needed someone to slap me and say \\"He's just not that into you!\\". The pessimist in me always assumed the worst anyway. But none the less, the book was definitely funny.  I had seen the preview for this and like a lot of people in it. I was not disappointed! It seems people either liked or hated this movie, I fall into the like category. It kept my attention from beginning to end, which is very hard to do, I inevitably will be reaching for my computer to browse around online 8 times out of 10.<br /><br />Some people find too many characters confusing, but these ones all were very distinct and no one over shadowed the other. Some of the relationships are fun and flirty, others seem destined to end. People have compared it to 'love,actually', though I personally didn't see any similarities besides the multiple 'relationships'. 'He's just not that into you' centered more around late 20's and 30's age people, I think 'love, actually' spanned a larger age range and not only were dating and married, but deaths, divorce and families. No one in this flick had families with their partner yet.<br /><br />I think it's definitely worth checking it out, especially if you've dated and gotten mixed signals. You'll find lots of \\"oh god, that's just like me!\\" moments, both embarrassing and just plain true to life. Gigi, the narrator, is constantly reading too much into the actions of her dates and always convinced, sure maybe they like her but they're just getting side tracked from calling her. This story line alone was very cute and funny, on the other end of the spectrum there's a married couple having issues as well as a couple who has been together for 7 years and the girl is wondering \\"why won't he marry me??\\"<br /><br />Great, fun movies to check out with the girls. If you're not a perfect in every way couple, some of this might be uncomfortable to watch together.
B00260HH3K|2.0|There's surprisingly little evolving going on in \\"Dragonball: Evolution.\\" If anything, it de-evolves, taking an archetypal hero's journey and stripping it down past the bare minimum. So many details are either quickly alluded to or altogether overlooked, which essentially leaves us with a fairly bland action adventure story that throws in a little self-discovery for good measure. Based on the \\"Dragon Ball\\" graphic novels written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama, \\"Dragonball: Evolution\\" is an airy, innocuous fable with a minimalist plot that doesn't require the audience to use their brains. It's really just an excuse for impressive visual effects and intriguing costume designs, and even then it doesn't quite work because not enough time is spent on them.    First, a little back story: During a solar eclipse 2,000 years ago, the evil alien warlord Piccolo (James Marsters) and his henchman, Oozaru, came to Earth with the intent to destroy it. Fortunately, a group of monks were able to imprison Piccolo with the aid of a spell. No one knew what happened to Oozaru, but it seems he's useless without his master's influence. As time goes on, Earth goes back to normal.    During this introduction, we also learn about dragonballs, billiard-sized spheres that glow like fire. There are seven in total, and each have a specific number of stars floating over the surface. When all have been collected and brought to a hidden temple, they have the ability to bring forth a magical dragon that can grant one wish.    Now, the story proper: We meet a teenage martial arts student named Goku (Justin Chatwin), who's picked on at school and always fumbles his words when around attractive girls. He was raised his whole life by his grandfather, a martial arts instructor named Gohan (Randall Duk Kim). As we meet them, the two are engaged in hand-to-hand combat while balancing on a pair of elevated ropes, which must be some kind of pale reference to the gravity-defying stunts of films like \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" or \\"House of Flying Daggers.\\" As they fight, they draw strength from their Ki (in other words, they conjure up balls of light out of thin air and hurl them at each other). After the fight, we get a real sense of the film's dialogue; for Goku, this means an awkward series of one liners, and for Gohan, this means hopelessly cliché proverbs about having faith in yourself. Goku knows nothing about where he came from or why he never knew his parents, although Gohan insists that he'll get all the answers come his eighteenth birthday.    And lo and behold, his eighteenth birthday arrives. So does Piccolo, and while we never learn how he managed to escape, we do learn that he plans to track down all seven dragonballs and use them for his own sinister purposes during a solar eclipse. As he flies through the clouds aboard a strange metallic ship, he relies on a young and deadly servant girl named Mai (Eriko Tamura) to actually retrieve the dragonballs, which are apparently scattered all over the world.    When Goku inherits a dragonball from his grandfather, it becomes his mission to track down the remaining dragonballs and save the world from total destruction. Along the way, he meets: Muten Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat), the martial arts master who instructed Gohan; the ridiculously named and technologically well-equipped Bulma Briefs (Emmy Rossum, who I remember much more affectionately as Christine from \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\"); and Yamcha (Joon Park) a desert bandit whose sole motivating force is a share of the profits. They're eventually joined by Goku's high school crush, the sweet-natured Chi-Chi (Jamie Cheung), who competes in martial arts tournaments in her spare time.    Never once does this movie pause to offer an explanation for anything. For starters, where exactly does this story take place? The exotic temples and village names hint at somewhere in Asia--a nighttime shot of a neon-drenched city skyline suggests Hong Kong. But since there's absolutely no language barrier, not even for an alien that's thousands of years old, it's hard to know for sure. Revealing that Yamcha talks like a surfer dude will probably be of no help, and don't get me started on the fact that the movie was filmed on location in Mexico. Moving on (and I alluded to this earlier), how exactly did Piccolo escape? How did Mai come to be in his service? What exactly is this Capsule Corporation that Bulma works for?    The ending is a nightmare unto itself for two very specific reasons: (1) it relies on a plot twist that the story wasn't building up to; (2) it culminates with an act of charity so PG-rated that it's downright anticlimactic. And what of the PG rating? Could that be the reason why a story about the threat of annihilation seems so unthreatening? It's probably the reason why I wasn't able to take Piccolo seriously--his pale green skin, dome-like bald head, and muscular black suit make him look more like a goofy invader from Mars than a frightening warlord from beyond. I know it's the reason why Chow Yun-Fat's dialogue was laughably bad. If there's one thing this man shouldn't have to do, it's recite lines that mention the collectability of a swimsuit magazine. I could be mistaken, but I have a feeling that most audiences will not expect such dialogue from a film like \\"Dragonball: Evolution.\\"
0756405890|5.0|While I do not consider myself a well-read fan of the fantasy genre (I'm more of a literary/horror follower), I picked this book up at random in a grocery store because I'm an English major with over a thousand books I've ALREADY read, and I needed a new one. So it was a complete gamble. Who is this Patrick Rothfuss fellow? I had no clue.    After reading The Name of the Wind, I can say without a double that this is one of the best books I've ever read. Each of the characters ends up feeling like a well-loved friend by the time you're finished, and when it does end, you wish you could stay in the Four Corners of Civilization longer. You'll probably reread the book to do just that.     And the emotional connections in the book are amazing - everyone from professional musicians to broke college students will find something to relate to. The writing style is lyrical and the relationships are moving. Descriptions of grief, desperation, and curiosity are set forth in loving detail and authenticity. Kvothe's journey from child prodigy among the gypsy-like Edema Ruh to his stormy adolescence among the alchemists and warlocks of the University is enthralling all the way through. Don't be surprised if you devour this tome in one sitting. I did.    Better than The Lord of the Rings for the poetic brevity of its prose, and miles above Harry Potter with its much more skilled rendition of the \\"young magician goes to school\\" theme. Kvothe is, literally, too cool for school, destined to be one of the great literary heroes of our time.     To sum it up: This book is the real deal, whether you're a fan of fantasy or not. Go buy it. Now. What are you waiting for?! I said now!
0385340990|5.0|The book was in outstanding condition and was received in a timely fashion.  I am very pleased.
1401923119|2.0|Although interesting, even fascinating at moments, a non-scientist reader has to read through chapter after chapter of too much, too detailed scientific jargon, anxiously waiting to get to \\"the point\\"...and how this applies to changing lives.  Around Chapter 4 Mr Lipton eludes to the fact that he is going to get to it, but frustrating to the reader, never does!  So much potential to truly change lives, but comes up disappointing. Not worth the price.
0525951113|4.0|I finished reading this book a few days ago after my father had told me what a great book it was. I have to say that Daemon was a good book but it was not as good as he made it out to be.<br /><br />The story is fast paced and the beginning of the book is very strong. Others have already mentioned this. Then \\"ending\\" -using quotes for emphasis- is frustrating. There are a couple of twists but there is really no resolution. Others have noted that this is likely due to the planned sequel called Freedom. What ever the reason, I feel like I was cheated an ending.<br /><br />Some critics have also pointed out how absurd the events in the book are. There are several parts that are highly unlikely but definitely possible for someone with enough money. One example provided in another review mentioned the ridiculous unmanned motor bikes with blades attached. In the context of the book, this was not absurd at all if one takes into consideration the unmanned Humvee described in the very early parts of the book. Saying the unmanned Humvee is plausible yet claiming the unmanned motorbikes are stretching the realm of possiblity is sort of... well, stupid.<br /><br />Anyway, the book is good not great. I suggest it for anyone who likes a good ride but isn't too concerned about the destination.
0307278255|2.0|Same old story but without strength of Interpreter of Maladies.  The characters are weaker and the story lines are less interesting.  She is getting dangerously close to being a one-trick pony.
B0019X3YXM|1.0|This film is billed as a romantic comedy, but it is neither romantic nor funny. It is the story of a \\"nice,\\" but bored, college boy who falls in love with a destructive girl. We learn at the end that Jordan's destructive behavior is due to a \\"painful secret,\\" but the most painful part of this film is the film itself. Jordan's (Elisha Cuthbert's) \\"hotness\\" doesn't make up for this lousy movie.<br /><br />There are no likable characters, and none of the characters make any sense. Ostensibly, Charlie's reason for falling in love with Jordan is that his parents are so nice and conventional that he craves people who are the opposite. For her part, Jordan has her own sick reasons for liking Charlie, and all the maudlin sappiness at the end doesn't redeem this story; if anything, it makes it worse. I can't tell you what Jordan's painful secret is without spoiling the movie (as if I could spoil it!), but I can tell you that her pain doesn't explain her behavior. By the middle of this film I felt convinced that Charlie loved Jordan not in spite of her destructive behavior but because of it, and there's nothing romantic or funny about that! Maybe Charlie also has a \\"painful secret\\" that could explain away his actions? I'll look for that in the sequel.<br /><br />In the end, I was left wondering why Charlie felt so strongly attracted to an incredibly rude, destructive, selfish, irrational alcoholic who, even after she has pulled herself together, is still completely irrational with silly talk about \\"destiny.\\" Take destiny into your own hands and avoid this movie!

B001W63DX2|5.0|Just after enjoying two Iron Maiden Concerts in Costa Rica, I saw this movie last Wednesday 22nd in San José and definitely it was the best way to close a successful world wide tour, an amazing present for all Iron Maiden's Fans. By far, the best rock documentary I had ever seen. This is a must have DVD for anyone who appreciate REAL bands, REAL musicians. In his first documentary \\"The History Of Iron Maiden - Pt. 1: The Early Days\\"...the beginning and the process of conforming the best metal band of all times and now in Flight 666... other sides of the band and the evidence of Iron Maiden's positive and permanent influence. SCREAM FOR MAIDEN...COSTA RICA!!!
B0011Z3DK2|5.0|I could choose pretty much any LepZep album, (I'm showing my age, obviously). \\"Houses\\" definitely ranks right up there at The Top. I was there in West Berlin for their very last concert; two weeks before Bonham unfortunately died. Yeah, I was in the the USAF (Ret.) What a Trip it was...<br /><br />Imagine being inside a converted Ice Sport Halle. A tiny place, wooden and perhaps holding 200 people (SRO). Sweat, Alcohol, other Aromatic delights (gotta love those West Germans), and last but not least: Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />I was also a photographer using my Olympus OM-10 35mm camera with primo color slide film. I am the proud owner on many Zep slides but my favorite and most tragic pic is, well, what is now looking into the eyes of a dying man. Tragic indeed. However, all things pass as they always do, such is the human condition for centuries & centuries. I never sold the picture although many offered many dollars - I just can't.<br /><br />My current \\"Plan\\" is to contact his son. This is not to SELL it, mind you, but perhaps work out some insane deal to encourage and help support Music in our Schools. If I do not get a single Penny or Pound, it's fine with me. It isn't about the Almighty Dollar, but basic human decency. I am not Holy (Pun, get that? Hehe). That's my Zep Story and I hope you enjoyed reading it.
B000EULJLU|1.0|My God is Tool an awful, awful band.  This is officially a band that has absolutely *nothing* going for them.  They have NO interesting guitar riffs, NO interesting vocal melodies, and absolutely no reason to create an album like this.  It's an insult to people with good taste in rock music.    What's up with the lead singer?  He's not even singing most of the time- he's just obnoxiously talking over the guitar playing, many times even whispering for an *incredibly* long period of time.  Every song is like this- talk or whisper over an unmemorable guitar riff, make the song 10 minutes long, and repeat the same formula again for the next track.    If it wasn't for the lyrics this band would mean absolutely nothing to anyone.  Musically, this is commercial rock at its most generic.  What's even worse is how Tool insists on writing lengthy songs with every release which is probably a deliberate attempt to annoy everyone.  Writing lengthy songs certainly doesn't show me any talent from the members of Tool.  These guys definitely aren't an important art/progressive rock band.  For the most part it's just the same guitar riffs recycled over and over, and even if it's not, it sure *seems* like it.      One thing's for sure- I don't recommend this band to *anybody* with a pair of ears.  The music has grown on me after repeated listens to the point where it doesn't annoy me as much as it did upon fist listen, but honestly, the music has grown on me because it's not the most annoying thing out there; just completely mediocre.  It has grown on me enough to remember what some songs are like, because I was forcing myself to try and accept this kind of rock by clearing my mind assuming that would be the only way to get into it.  It didn't work.  I just don't have the strength to do it, sorry.    The appeal of a band like this is a mystery to me.  How about this?  Just look up the lyrics for the songs, read them, admire the band for their lyric-writing abilities, and don't even waste your time with horribly generic commercial alternative rock such as this.
B001FB55MG|5.0|Now few movies can claim to be entertaining for both adults and children but this one was. I could end the review there but Adam Sandler often annoys me with his squeaky little voice when he's trying to be funny but in this movie he reminded me of Dick Van Dyke who also annoyed me at times but who seemed to just gel with those Disney movies and come alive for childrens and adults alike.<br /><br />If Sandler stays in this genre he might do well to emulate the career of Van Dyke who more or less is remembered for his role in Mary Poppins even more so, I would venture, than the lady herself ;)<br />Excellent movie that I wouldn't mind watching over with children... and over.... and over....
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Just three comments to add to the other reviews:  [1] I haven't spoken with Anyone who has not liked this show immensely;  [2]  I almost stopped watching initially because I thought it was going to be too gruesome for me;  however, there wasn't, and there is no gratutious violence or gore, and much less generally than one would expect;  and [3] I credit Dexter with helping me lose weight : )  I watch whilst on the elliptical and I just keep going ..,,,    Each season is like a book, so it's best to start at the beginning of a season, and ideally season 1.  The DVD set is great for that.
B0011Z8SHK|5.0|There I was in Minot, stationed as a Airman Security Policeman. My friends and I sneaked (snuck?)into the Windmill at the tender age of 18. Fake ID's, of course and for the sake of security, I shall not divulge our Tactic for nasty fakes. (I know, a lot of you are laughing right now...)<br /><br />The first song I heard was from Deep Purple and a great evening ensued.<br /><br />Oh, the stories...<br /><br />This is simply a CLASSIC!
B0012Q732O|3.0|I like it but not enough to buy it, but my son wanted me to buy it.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|So, I bought this cd quite a while ago (when 'I Kissed A Girl' started getting really popular and mainstream), listened to it once, and tossed it with another pile of cds to collect dust. Then recently for some reason (not totally sure why... maybe because her singles keep coming and are awesome)... Anyway--after another listen I found that I like it more than before. And after a couple listens, I'm loving this cd, always want to listen to it. Her voice is very unique today, yet there is something familiar about it. It's like there is some retro hint in the sound of it mixed with something new... If that makes any sense... She wrote or co-wrote every song on this cd. She is very tongue-in-cheek in her lyrics, and they are very fun. Her lyrics definitely don't sound like some of the recycled themes playing on the radio all the time. She might be telling the same story sometimes, but it sounds new. After getting hooked on this, I even found myself searching for more music from her on iTunes and found some great stuff there as well (check out her stuff with The Matrix).     - 'One of the Boys' is the first song on the cd, but is not really my favorite. I usually skip over it, but she mentions spiders and belching. I can't really get on board with that personally, but I'm sure many others will love this song.  - And obviously 'I Kissed A Girl' and 'Hot N Cold' are very fun and catchy songs, with her first single being a little on the risque side. 'Hot N Cold' is co-written by Max Martin, who is always churning out pop hits with popular singers out there (Kelly Clarkson, Britney Spears, etc), but it seems like her music is in a category of pop all itself. And there are other great songs on here that are so Katy Perry sounding (you'll get that after listening to her cd), but sound different than the singles.  - 'Waking Up In Vegas' is another fun song, where she's telling a story about making some mistakes in Vegas with a guy friend... Hmmm... Good lyrics, catchy beat, and gotta love her voice.  - 'Thinking of You' is another single, but I felt that it doesn't quite fit into the same category as her other singles before this. This is a slow song that is raw with emotion. Great lyrics. Her voice really gives this song the emotion it needs for the lyrics and is a big part of what makes the song so good. The video for this is really great too, but grab a tissue or two. And I've been playing this song so much--it's even my ringtone!  - 'Mannequin' is a song that is about a guy who just doesn't seem to feel anything. Haven't all of us ladies experienced this? An example of her lyrical talent: \\"I keep knocking on wood/Hoping there's a real boy inside\\"    Love it!  - 'Ur So Gay' is definitely a sassy song. It's in reference to a guy she's dating/dated who is metrosexual and apparently annoying. The song is very catchy with some funny lyrics, although unfortunately a couple get blanked out even though this said nothing about being edited. The songs are so good I can't hold that against this cd! Sample lyric: \\"I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf\\"  - 'If You Can Afford Me' is a fun song about money being important in a relationship, but she never sounds snobby or pretentious in this song. You can tell it's just in fun. It's a song that will ruffle some people's feathers if they take it too seriously (like many of her songs I think).   - 'Lost' is another slow song. I almost like her slow ones better, but then I listen to her upbeat, fun songs... and I like those too! She is really great at pulling off both styles effortlessly. She really sings with passion on these songs. This is a very good one, but not my favorite slow one (that would be 'Thinking of You').   - 'Self Inflicted' is about a relationship or relationships that leave scars, but how we allow them to happen. Sometimes you know something or someone is bad for you or that it won't work out, but you go for it anyway (hence it being self inflicted). Good one, but not my favorite... Although the songs keep growing on me.  - 'I'm Still Breathing' is another slow one. It is a really good one. You can feel the emotion in it. It sounds like a suicidal song at first, but then you realize it's about the death of a relationship and that pain. \\"Say something funny/Say something sweet/But don't say that you loved me/I'm still breathing/But we've been dead for a while\\"  This song has such a haunted sound to it--amazing. It's quickly becoming one of my favorites. This one really shows her talent.  - 'Fingerprints' is the last song. A song about leaving her mark on the world (I think she has already). It has a good message. The song sounds a little punk, but still pop. The chorus is upbeat. Not my favorite out of all the others, but still good and it's still growing on me too with each listen.    This cd is one you need to listen to a couple of times before you realize how much you love it, and then it just hits you when you find yourself wanting to listen to it all the time. After becoming addicted to this cd and other songs I've found of hers or featuring her on iTunes, it's clear that she will have a good career. I can't wait to hear more from her.   Highlights: I Kissed a Girl, Thinking of You, Ur So Gay, Self Inflicted, I'm Still Breathing... but all are worth a listen (or a couple...).
0061537934|5.0|I find it hard to describe why I enjoyed this book so much. I think you have to have loved a dog at some time in your life to understand. It is a lovely book with many memorable characters. I look forward to reading more from this author.
B001TOD92C|4.0|I had heard that this was a very good movie.  In spite of that, I almost did not watch it as I am not a wrestling aficionado.  I am glad that I decided to see it.  It is really very good.<br /><br />It features Mickey Rourke as Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, a one time star professional wrestler who is well past his prime.  As with many who are used to the limelight, he is having great difficulty giving it up.  He has been reduced to competing/performing in very out of the way places.<br /><br />He is offered a chance to have a rematch of his biggest ever match from 20 years earlier against The Ayatollah.  While preparing for that, he continues to wrestle in the periphery of the wrestling game.  He is also experiencing health problems (has open heart surgery), is trying to re-establish his relationship with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), and is attempting to forge a relationship with a stripper, Pam (stage name Cassidy) played by Marisa Tomei.<br /><br />The story is very well done and the acting by Tomei and Wood is top notch.  Rourke's portrayal of The Ram is simply outstanding.<br /><br />This is very well done and is worth watching.  I would not recommend it for younger viewers as it contains several adult themes.
B000HR1YHE|4.0|You know, I watched all of the original series when I was too young to understand what was going on.  The past two or three months I watched all 3 seasons and The Cage.  They are so much better than I remember.  Most of the dialoge is pretty good.  If you watch The Menagerie, you see just about everything in The Cage.
B0024F08RO|5.0|the 4th season isn´t the best season of prison break , but much, much better than the short 3rd.  its a rollercoster ride and really cool to watch. can´t wait to by the dvd with 2 extra episodes !
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I read the entire book series in like 2 weeks (I know, nerd alert!). I did so AFTER seeing the first season and I am so glad I did! It was fun picturing the actors as I read the books, especially Alexander Skarsgard as Eric in book 4, by far my fave.    Show is different from books and I think that might keep it a bit more exciting, not knowing everything that will happen. Both are addicting and worth every minute!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Favorite show of all time!!!!!! Too bad it was cancelled before it had a chance to be seen by the masses, if it would've been allowed to run a little longer, it probably would still be airing, even now!!!!!!
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|One of the best financial calculators out there.  I already have a different version of this same calculator and use it for work all the time.  I also know people who have had their HP12c for 20 years and still use it so you know they can last awhile.  And once I got used to the RPN method of using a calculator, I always have to think twice about using a regular one.  There's also way more functions on this calculator than anyone would ever need.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I was actually getting used to mediocre to poor DM releases (though I did like PTA).<br /><br />So I wasn't expecting much here, but I gotta say...YES!  This is no Violator, but it's no Exciter either.  If you even kind of liked ANY album after Songs of Faith and Devotion, just get this.<br /><br />I loved it on first listen, which hasn't happened to me in a long time.<br /><br />And Gahan's voice apparently never ages.  Jeez, he's no spring chick, yet his voice sounds as full and strong as it did in the 80's.  Amazing.<br /><br />I am shocked at people panning this one though.  Exciter?  One star.  Ultra?  One star.  PTA?  3 t o 4 stars.<br /><br />This imo is a step in the direction back to the \\"old\\" DM sound.<br /><br />I love it.  Will be listening back to back for at least a week.

0316067598|5.0|I am a reader of many many soldier's true stories and this book (among many) is just absolutely the best yet I have read.  I couldn't put it down and have loaned mine out and recommended it to many others.  I highly recommend getting the book and be ready for a day devoted to reading as you will not want to put the book down.  Highly recommeded!!!  Need I  say more?    VF in IL
B000JBWWBK|5.0|The soundtrack for the movie is spectacular. It is perfect for a lonely lazy afternoon or for a night out with the lady after a candlelight dinner. It's inspiring, romantic and adventurous without being too much of either of them...in short, blissful!    If you've liked the movie like i have then you might be a little disappointed at not having a few songs on the OST such as the track that plays in most trailers of the movie and that plays when he's driving the tiny Smart car (Moi Lolita - Alizee) or the song that plays in the open air restaurant just before it starts raining down (Boum - Charles Trenet).    Overall though, the score is perfect!
B001TODCII|5.0|Released in the U.S. in January, 2009, \\"Taken\\" is one kick-axx movie! In fact, it's the best I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />THE PLOT: Liam Neeson plays a retired CIA agent whose 17-year-old daughter is abducted by Albanian sex-slavers while vacationing in Paris. Neeson immediately flies to Paris and utilizes all his skills to find his daughter and mercilessly punish anyone involved in the sex-trade who gets in his way.<br /><br />\\"Taken\\" plays out like a James Bond flick but without the goofiness and boring parts. Once Neeson gets on the trail of the sex-slavers it's non-stop suspense and action until the end.<br /><br />What makes the film work so well is that, like Neeson's character in the story, the viewer is left totally outraged by the sex-slaver's abduction of his daughter; hence, you're passionately rooting for him throughout the rest of the flick.<br /><br />It's true that Neeson is a veritable one-man-army in the film but it's presented in such a way that the viewer is able to suspend disbelief. In other words, it SEEMS believable. More than that, you WANT it to be believable because you want him to get his daughter back and annihilate the scumbags. Besides, Neeson is realistically portrayed as a father ruthlessly driven and pulling no punches. He has the emotional edge and determination that the slavers lack. He's an unstoppable force pure and simple.<br /><br />The film addresses a scary subject -- the sex-slave trade. This really happens. I know of two beautiful young girls locally who have disappeared while vacationing abroad; one was in Cancun and the other in Africa. The parents and siblings are left devastated and scarred for life. What happened to the girls? No one knows, but the sex-slave trade is a very real possibility. Not to mention the Natalee Holloway case; Urine Van der Sloot confessed in an interview that he sold Natalee for $10,000 and a boat came and picked her up. This would explain why no remains have been found. Although he later retracked the statements the strong possibility remains that Natalee may have been sold into the sex-slave trade.<br /><br />The moral of \\"Taken\\" is simple: Anyone involved in the sex-slave trade deserves nothing but instant and merciless obliteration from this plane of existence.<br /><br />Incidentally, I read Roger Ebert's review before seeing the film and he gave it a mediocre 2.5/4 Star rating. Nothing could be further from the truth. \\"Taken\\" pulls you in and and takes you on an enthralling thrill ride throughout its runtime. Not to mention it's well made on every level. But let's remember that Ebert gave the overrated and pretentious \\"No Country for Old Men\\" a perfect 4/4 rating. Unbelievable.<br /><br />The film was shot on location in France and runs a short-but-sweet hour and a half.<br /><br />PERSONAL GRADE: Apossibility remains that Natalee may have been sold into the sex-slave trade.

B001EOQWFI|5.0|I really liked the message of this movie and was pleasantly surprised by the animation and glimpse into the future of Earth.  GORGEOUS on Bluray.  HIGHLY recommended for those whom have children or want some of the best visuals on BLuray today.  Eye cnady for 2 hours and the supplements are plentiful.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|For those unfamiliar with Dario Argento may not realize how big an influence he has. It was thanks to this incredible Italian director that Romero's Original Dawn of the Dead came into flesh eating life, helping with funding, music and even European Distribution of the original film. He even flew Romero to Rome, Italy where the first drafts of the Original Dawn of the Dead began.     Specializing in Giallo (Italian for yellow, from which the term was coined from books of a seedy or horrific nature printed on God-awful yellow paper), the director's best known venture for tormenting your mind is Suspiria. The film has an uneasy and foreboding atmosphere from the get go, even the music reeks of something horrible is about to happen. But that's where it gets you, you don't know when it will happen! When it does it makes most slasher film deaths look incredibly tame by any measure.     Watching Suspiria is like watching a painting come to life, except it starts to grow into an nightmare ever so slowly. Filled with beautiful sets and vivid colors, this film at times has the feel of a musical from how lavish the backgrounds the horror takes place in. Also the lighting, much like the color reference as a visual cue in the Sixth Sense, has a lot to do with what will happen next. Violent is a relatively soft term compared to how brutal some of the death sequences are, which surprisingly is the norm in Italian horror which is often way more over the top than a U.S. production would allow. Compared to today's standards, if Suspiria were a U.S. movie, it would be banned for not being P.C.(i.e. the blind man being mauled to death by his own seeing eye dog) or severely edited for a more PG-13 audience.      All else aside, fans of Saw will appreciate the scene in which one gal takes a twenty foot plunge out a window into a pit of barbed wire and crawls through it to escape. OUCH! Makes me hurt just thinking about it. Most definitely this one will find ways under your skin and mostlikely into the darkest corners of your mind long after the lights go out....
B001FB55N0|4.0|I did not expect this to be as good as it was. Has a very good story to it and is a great family movie.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|I had stumbled upon this product by mistake looking for any new peripherals for the PS3.  I really like to play Call of Duty 4 and this makes the controls much better for people who have adult hands and can palm the PS3 controller.  I like the XBOX controllers since they have triggers and these Real triggers fill that void for the PS3.    For five bucks, its a great purchase despite it may sound silly on paper.  Highly recommended!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I've had this set since it came out, so I decided to add my two cents on it. I know there are fans who hated the fact that Lucas changed things from the original, but I say what he did made them better. I like the way they look now, and it also helped them since he made the prequels. For me, it was awesome to see some my favorite movies from my childhood come back to the big screen and have things added and enhanced. I really thought the extras did the movies a great deal of justice and made them look better. It made them look less fake, and more real. So basically, you either like it or you don't. So if you don't like it, don't buy it, and let those of us who do like it, enjoy it.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Looks dated with the special effects and the music could be worse than the soundtrack to Al Pacino's Scarface but still lots of fun to watch for an action movie.  A modern classic.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|I thought it was a very funny movie.  I'm glad I bought it.  It was funny when that one dog got his teeth brushed, oh and their big dog bark.  Really good.  I think every one should see this movie.  It's a feel good movie,'
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|I have taken a different view on Tom Cruise's persona; life however this movie is one of my favorites... Great addition to a bluray collection modestly priced at $14.99.   The sound in 5.1 is great, video is pristine considering it was made in the 80's.      Any fan of Top Gun should rent or buy this.  One of my personal favorites.
B000YJ54DU|1.0|Normally I enjoy whatever story Lee Child has dreamed up for his character Jack Reacher at least enough to ignore the anti-American asides and to overlook that fact that the military police are not, unfortunately, considered elite by anyone other than Mr. Child.  And even if that last point does blow his premise out of the water from the very start of each book, Mr Chold usually tells an engaging enough story for me to forgive him for it.  But I actually slogged my way through 100 pages of Nothing to Lose before my frustration caused me to set the book down, to only be picked up again when I put it in the recycling bin.  It was so bad that i couldn't bring myself to donate it, springing that awful story line on some other Reacher fan.  There was absolutely no reason for him to continue going into that town that Mr. Child enjoyed describing as bleak and hopeless.  Yes, I understand Reacher's need to save everyone, as it is one of the reasons I read Reacher books in the first palce; that hope that there are good guys out there who might come to aid me or my loved ones should trouble ever come our way.  I get that.  And I get that Reacher is supposed to be unusually resourceful.  What I don't get is why Mr. Child couldn't come up with a better reason for Reacher to keep going back into that town.  Was he really that incapable of coming up with nothing better than Reacher's stubbornness?  And why did he torment us by repeatedly pointing out that reacher really had NO reason for going back time after time?  I can overlook a great deal when suspending disbelief but this was a rare book for me.  Once I pick up a book I almost never put it down, slogging my way through almost anything to follow a story.  This slog was simply too hard and too pointless.  And I realized that I had Nothing to Lose by throwing it out after beating my way through 100 pointless pages.  You can be sure when Child comes out with his next Reacher book, instead of hitting the &#34;buy&#34; button, I'll be careful to hit &#34;sample&#34; instead.  And if one little thing in that sample irks me, I won't be buying any more Reacher books.
B001DSNF8C|4.0|I had recently purchased the Collector's Edition Bluray and its a fantastic package for 19.99 but I found the extras were dated since they were crafted towards the new Bond film.  This a gritty Bond film but for those looking to start a good bluray collection, this is a good start along with Batman Begins, Planet Earth, Kill Bill 1 and 2, and Band of Brothers.
B0006L0LNY|5.0|I am so happy with this movie.  I had great luck with ordering and then I got it home and watched it.  I love this movie.
B0017TYPIG|1.0|The Blu-Ray Cool Hand Luke is MONO!!!!!  Not even a feeble attempt at stereo or 5.1.  One great movie, but don't waste your money on the Blu-Ray!  Buy it on standard DVD if all you get is MONO.  I was foolish enough to assume that there was no such thing as MONO on a Blu-Ray.  I'm so angry over this purchase, I CAN'T EVEN SEE STRAIGHT.  Truth be told, I didn't even check before buying because I wouldn't have believed that such a thing could even exist!
0375826726|5.0|Paolini does it again! The books hold my attention like few others have. The characters have depth and the story is well thought out. I don't know what else to say. I can't wait for the last book in the cycle. Read if you enjoy fantasy, dragons, or elves.
B000002LAC|3.0|I bought this CD for the song \\"Wildflowers\\" which I love!  However, the \\"remastering\\" of this older CD/song leaves much to be desired.  But, that said, at least I can hear the song!  The song I give 5 stars, the quality of the CD, barely 3 stars.
B001LYD2JU|4.0|i bought this album in 1980 when it first came out, and the songs are excellent, but i've always felt the production was pretty weak.    i think roger glover is a good producer but i almost feel like he sabotaged michael's first album because it was competing with rainbow's \\"down to earth\\" record which he produced shortly before this came out. (that album sounded great!)    anyway, this is worth picking up just for the extra songs. the live versions of \\"armed and ready\\" and \\"into the arena\\" are awsome, as well as the other live songs. the studio songs are demos i guess but are pretty interesting.    this album was a great start to a career that kind of got side tracked by poor management, line up changes, and substance abuse problems.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|The Blue Ray is beautiful!  The colors and detail are excellent and the story is classic.  The bonus material is also excellent in the making of Pinnocchio.  GET IT!
B00008WT5C|5.0|this is one of the most \\"in your face\\", live sounding rock n roll records ever made! i love every song on this album, every song from the bon scott era for that matter. but \\"let there be rock\\" just sounds like they plugged in in a large room and just cranked everything all the way up.     i've heard live versions of most of these songs and the studio record has as much energy as one of their live shows!    truly one of the greatest rock groups ever!!!
B000IVW25M|4.0|One of the greatest animated films of all time. What a pleasure to share it with my daughter. She loves it!
6304698690|5.0|I saw the original movie as a very young child and have always wanted to see it again.  This remake was great and I got another DVD to give to my sister.
B000REZ446|5.0|I STARTED RECENTLY READING CLASSIC NOVELS. EVERY THING FROM THE BIBLE TO ULYSSES. THIS BY FAR WAS THE BEST AND FUNNIEST BOOK I'VE READ. I ALSO BELIEVE CATCH-22 MUST HAVE BEEN THE INFLUENCE FOR THE MOVIE AND TV SERIES OF M*A*S*H. EXCELLENT AND VERY EASY TO READ
193413712X|5.0|Harding's prose is alive and brilliant. You'll find yourself reading aloud and wishing that you were the author. In fact, the writing is so beautiful that Harding could tell you any old thing, and you'd probably consider your time well spent.  But Harding's fine words are not merely beautiful; they unfold and lay bare and put flesh on the lives of his characters. He offers them to you as intimates, unobstructed and luminous. Your distance from story falls away, and you recognize something that's true.  That is Harding's accomplishment, and it is a remarkable one.
0810970686|5.0|I purchased the whole series for both my 13 yr. old & 10 yr. old.  They loved the books, couldn't put them down.  Even had discussions about them.  It was great to see that enthusiam in both of my children.  GREAT STORY TELLING!!!  Hope more are made.
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|It is best to watch this back to back. First Casino Royale and then this one. It picks up directly where the other left off. It will leave you exhausted afterward, wanting more. Big Thumbs Up! Sean Connery was my favorite and he instantly comes to mind when JB's name is mentioned. Daniel Craig is the next best thing as far as I am concerned. He is tough, quick, dresses up classy and maintains an air of masculinity that was missing since Sean Connery was replaced.
1569242739|5.0|This collection of recipes is absolutely fantastic!  Even our non-vegan friends adore these.  There are also delicious gluten free recipes, and so many fun variations of each cupcake you will love creating them.  If you love cupcakes, whether you are vegan or not, you must buy this book, you will thoroughly enjoy it!
0316066524|1.0|It always stings just a little more than usual when I hate a book I want to like. Nobody wants to dislike Infinite Jest (or to admit it, anyway, for fear of seeming too dumb to follow brilliant writing). So I guess I'm too dumb for Infinite Jest--and I read it on Kindle so I had quick access to the definitions of his big, often obscure words.    Now my confession: I only read about four percent of the book. I took my time, tried to process each word, sentence, and essay-long paragraph, but in the end it none of it said anything to me. Here's what I took from my time with Infinite Jest: A tennis prodigy interviews with an admissions board, they question his test scores, he says a bunch of stuff but he was actually having a seizure and had to be restrained ... ? Now a character is waiting for a girl to bring him some primo dope so he can smoke it all and not share and ... yawn ... sorry. Then a kid thinks he's going to the dentist but it's really some sort of counselor and they have a long battle of wits to see which one of them is the bigger booger-eating nerd, but then it turns out it was his dad in disguise. I tried to go on, but there comes a point in a man's life where he realizes that his ten bucks is gone forever.    When the author dumbed down his vocabulary (a happening seemingly exclusive to similes and metaphors), it was, in fact, brilliant. Too bad he used the other 99.5 percent of what I read to show off his amazing vocabulary and his equally stunning ignorance of communication skills. It was like he looked in a thesaurus for the most unusual and least-known words he could find and flooded his story with them. And if you could get past that, the content itself was boring.    Call me undereducated or dumb or whatever you like, but I'll stick to books that capture the reader's attention and interest in the first chapter or two and that keep readers turning pages because they care what happens to well-developed characters in interesting plots.
B001TH16DS|4.0|7 Dual-Layer BD-50s.    Those aren't cheap by any means (price any blank ones lately?) and there are 7 fully-loaded discs in this set.  I'm not a Trekkie (my friend is) but this is certainly a good value for what is offered.  I'll probably check it out for th 7.1 HD audio--not going to get that on DVD or HD-DVD.
0312944926|5.0|This book is amazing. I had to buy it for my dad so he could read it because I liked it so much!!! I can't wait untill the next book to come out because I'm sure it will great too.
B001CW7MD8|5.0|Opeth have created yet another masterpiece to add to their unbelievable collection of epic and breathtaking music. Deliverance is definitely among the best they have ever done, with tracks like \\"Masters Apprentices\\", and \\"Wreath\\", and not to mention the title track \\"Deliverance\\", they impose such feeling and emotion upon the listener, you can't help but listen to them over and over. This album, along with all of their collection, is not to be missed.
B000000993|3.0|Undertow is an amazing flat out Progressive hard rock which some called it alt. rock...whatever though, the band's hit song Sober was a big hit from the band and with Adam Jones's art work also got them high on the Billboard charts. Undertow was certified gold in 1994 and Their song Prison Sex struck up a whole world of censorship the song has nothing to do with the words in the song, its more like a Maynard/metaphor lol. Overall Undertow is a great Tool album.
B0013FBS20|4.0|When I first heard the concept of this will was a man(Played by will smith) who is left alone in a city over run by monsters, I feard it wouldnt have enough to hold up to films such as the re-make of Dawn of The Dead.      However as I watched it I was plesently surpised about the pure depth of the story and all that came with it. There was some nice action and surpises as well.     Only real flaw is at times some of the special effects are poorly done. They look some what fake. but if you can look past that you will find a wonderful movie . Well worth buying.
B00004YA66|4.0|Looks like everybody enjoyed this film.  Totally implausible but fun to the max. Dennis Quaid warm, comfortable, charming, as usual.  Loved it!
B000MZHW4A|3.0|I really like this movie, it's one of the few I've enjoyed enough to consider watching more than once.. BUT the movie also tries to hammer home african unrest and turmoil, child soldiers, enormous refuge camps, \\"conflict\\" diamonds, mindless violence, mercenary military actions based solely on profit and monetary gain, etc. until it becomes annoyingly heavy handed... nearly to the point of interfering with the movie itself... I watch movies to distract myself from real life, not to be scolded for some of horrible and inhumane things that happen in this world..       The three stars I gave this move would be closer to five if not for the guilt trip that results from watching it.
0743455967|5.0|There is no magic formula, if you want to succeed in writing \\"you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot... in waiting rooms, at the checkout, on the treadmill, and in the john.\\" Without a doubt, Stephen King has a gift for storytelling that has captivated millions of readers, but as the author points out himself: it took time, perseverance and a modicum of luck to get where he is today.<br /><br />\\"On Writing\\" is part biography and part guidebook on the craft of writing. First part of the book covers Stephen King's childhood and early career; second part talks about the mechanics of writing, with many references to Strunk and White's \\"Elements of Style\\"; third part provides King's view on his close encounter with death and how it has affected his life.<br /><br />The book is filled with great tips, perspectives, and pearls of wisdom that any aspiring writer, blogger, or entrepreneur can put to good use - after all, the ability to craft a story is useful in any trade. Highly recommended and a captivating read, irrespective whether you read King's work or not.
B001RTP48G|5.0|A great outing from the Boys and I am in that camp that thinks this is their best since Very.  It is certainly one of their most consistent albums and from track 1 made me smile.  Some of this is just perfect happy (yes, happy) bouncy pop songs. The others are beautiful, slower ballads.  Beautiful arrangements, great guitar and strings, Neil in fine voice - this is a great treat timed perfectly for summer.  Enjoy!
B00000JZIK|2.0|I thought I bought the DVD.  Ended up with the authors rendition of this movie.  I need to re-order with out all the commentary.    Thx.  Debbie
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Another great album by Keith Urban, if you are not a fan, you are missing a lot.  Check out the album.
0786715103|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I think Dallaire's writing style is under-rated and perhaps un-appreciated. The bulk of the account of his time in Rwanda is written in a documentary, almost overly-efficient style. But I think this adds to the credibilty of a story that is almost beyond belief. The style gives the impression of a very reluctant unwilling story teller who has no choice but to tell it. The first part of the story gives a lot of auto-bigraphical material that at first seemed to be a little self-glorifying. But after reading  it the relevance, and even ironies, became clear. The book is extremely well researched as you would expect. I was very appreciative of the accronym glossary near the end of the book. The book was long but I didn't think long enough. I usually read books on the train during my commute. But I had to take this one home to finish.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|I happened to catch an episode of Breaking Bad on AMC one night while flipping channels. As it ended, I was immediately trying to find the episodes I had missed and set my DVR to record the ones coming up. When it hit DVD, I ordered it immediately and got all my friends, family and co-workers hooked on it as well.    I have watched Season 1 three times and am sure I will watch it again. Cranston heads up a stellar cast of likable and relatable characters telling a story of discovering who you are and what you are capable of when it comes to the ones you love.    Looking forward to Season 2's release...  ~Blu~
B000002UA9|5.0|this is a great album early beatles great songs like i saw her standing there, and the classic twist and shout. i highly reccomend.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I have waited many years to get Pinocchio on DVD.  This was one of the last great classic movies to finally reach my home on DVD.  I watched this as a child and my children (esp my sons) loved it.  \\"MONSTRO\\" was a villian whale. They loved to cheer for Pinocchio as his \\"family\\" is finally freed and Pinocchio becomes a real boy for saving \\"Father's\\" life.<br /><br />My grandson is 3 1/2 and loves this movie and we watch it over and over.  He has learned NEVER to trust a stanger and NEVER go off with stangers and that's a concept learned from this movie made 50 plus years ago!<br /><br />I recommend this movie to everyone adult or child!
B001UJ6IJC|5.0|I'm sure the book is just as good, but since the whole premise is \\"an oral history\\", I think it works best as an Radio drama. Can't wait for the movie. Apparently Brad Pitt's production company bought the rights.<br /><br />Here's a list of just a few of the cast: Max Brooks, Alan Alda, Carl Reiner, Mark Hamill,  John Turturro, Rob Reiner. I would have bought this for Alan Alda alone. I was listening to this on a flight, and wasn't expecting to hear all of these people, it made the time fly by. (I hate being on a plane.)<br /><br />The only down side is that some of the accents are really fake, like video game fake, and the narrator (Max Brooks) ends up being the worst of the voice actors. Every time he interrupts to ask a question I said, \\"Oh no not him again!\\". That being said, it is still one of the best Radio-drama/audiobooks I have listened to. Enjoy!
1433502410|5.0|The ESV has made reading the Bible easy and captivating.  I look forward to digging into God's Word each night, to see what else there is to learn and apply to my life (with God's help).  There is so much helpful information; in the text of the Bible, before each book and great reference material at the back of the Bible.  I love the online access to the Bible as well. Go for it, heavens knows we need people in our world who are digging in and learning and applying real truth that will last for an eternity.
B001TOD9VI|5.0|Everyone seems to have given the whole plot away In their reviews, as usual on here.  What more can I say?  That I am not a fan of wrestling either but heard Rourke's performance was great and thought I see what all the fuss was about.  Let me tell you folks that are not wrestling fans to forget about the wrestling part and just rent or go see this.  I don't think I ever knew what Compelling meant, right down to the bone until I saw this movie.  It could have been longer even!  Yes I believe this performance by Rourke to be his finest hour. He does make the movie!  And worthy of the Oscar nods It got!  As for being In Blue Ray well that only made It better. The DTS surround Is perfect for this movie!
0240810961|5.0|Although Stanchfield's book (I have Vol 1 only) is about Disney cartooning, it's a wonderful primer for any artist interested in giving life (animation!) to figures. Besides the great techniques discussed, and the clear step by step instructions, his writing is both clear, concise and at the same time very entertaining and personable.<br /><br />I'm an artist; for me, this will be a valued reference. My husband is a fan, and he was also fascinated by the discussions, the insights into how a great artist developed and 'saw' the world. We will both return to this book again and again.<br /><br />This is a book for the artist and collector/fan alike, with a strong emphasis on techniques - so if your admiration doesn't extend to HOW things were done and why they were done that way, a lot of this won't interest you. Stanchfield does include a fair amount of personal information, though, which expands the 'art lesson' feel tremendously. For those who draw, and those who love the 'fine art' of the top of the line animation, this book is a treasure.
0307474275|5.0|The Da Vinci Code has sparked numerous theories and controversy against most of what Catholic (Christians) believe in. This is part of the reason why I picked it up as well. I had heard a lot about this book in the news, through my library, school, and through my family. I decided to read this just for fun not realizing how contradictory it was towards the Catholic Church; I had thought originally that the book was \\"over talked\\" about. I mean really, how bad can one book be? So I decided to take a chance and I picked it up and dove into the ancient history Leonardo and his followers.  In the end, the book took so many twist in turns in history that it was definitely worth the read.<br /><br /> Premise of the story basically follows along  the lines of a certain group of people believe that Jesus has had relations with one of his disciples, Mary Magdalene producing children. Based off that, Robert Langdon is called to investigate a murder that will change his life. A Jacques Sauni&egrave;re is found murdered in the basement of the Louve in Paris, The police believe that he is the number one suspect because he was the last person to see him alive. Robert works with the Sauni&eacute;re's granddaughter in order to solve the case and to find the Holy Grail. In the end, we learn that Sauni&eacute;re had been protecting Sophia because she had been carrying the bloodline of Jesus. This thrilling novel will take you through some of the most darkest history known to man.<br /><br /> There were not many things that I did not like about the book. The only thing I would say that was bad, was that it went against my knowledge of what I had known about the Catholic Church. The book bended your knowledge what you thought you know and what they were trying to tell you what was true. It is true, after reading this book, it brought up many questions to my mind about what really happened back in the life time of Jesus. I did think to my self, saying that this is only fiction.<br /><br /> Overall I really enjoyed this novel. Mainly because it was an action novel, it seemed every second there was something going on. Every time you turned the page, you did not know what to expect. Dan Brown did and excellent job tying in facts into his story line as well. He would use Robert Langdon's thoughts to express information based off of history. Also, to weave such an intricate story line in with all of the action, I thought was superb!<br /><br /> I would recommend this book to any one who is looking for a thrill and to gain and test your knowledge as well. If you are willing to open up your mind to new ideas, then this book is defiantly for you. I would recommend thou, reading Angels and Demons  first because you can get a better perspective on Robert Langdon before reading the Da Vinci Code. With all said, this book is perfect for anyone looking for an adventure!Mainly because it was an action novel, it seemed every second there was something going on.

B001P3SA94|4.0|I happened to reach adolescence at the same time we moved to a virtually all Black pocket of poverty known as Marin City, CA.  There, I heard a type of music that immediately addicted me.  KDIA in Oakland, later KWBR broadcast an unending stream of genuine blues, R & B, and soul, not aimed at Whites, or caring what they thought.  Big Don Barksdale and Bouncin' Bill Doubleday held court, filling me with a love for the music that I have never lost  It was everywhere, in every home, every car, every place, and I couldn't get enough.  Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, John Lee Hooker, Sun House and all the all Delta Blues and Chicago Blues were my gods.  Not old enough, nor well-heeled enough for the club scene in SF, the radio was my connection that fed my addiction.  I knew all about the difficulty of life for those men and women as they struggled just to survive and make their music heard, and seethed with fury when slick White boys like the Beach Boys and Pat Boone started to steal the real music and get air play while my heroes were seldom heard.  I agree large parts of this movie are fictional, but the rough life and the hardship are not.  I believe racism will blight this movie, and it will never get the play it deserves, just as the \\"race\\" music didn't.  Yes, it is fictionalized, yes, it does leave out some great players, and yes, the music is not perfectly reproduced.  How could it be, considering the actors aren't the originals?  They do a pretty damn good job in my opinion.  They also have not had to live the abject poverty and open violence of the virulent discrimination of the times that informs the original men.  I think many of the Greats would be bemused to find that every great musician now pays tribute to their influence and true genius; I think even the incredible Keith Richards never fully understood why an angry and hostile Chuck Berry was so brusquely dismissive when he agreed to play with Keith.  If you weren't there, if you didn't live through it, no amount of book larnin' and movies are going to truly make you understand just how bad it was, and just how hard it was.  Or just what a miracle it is that the music still endures.  Accept Cadillac Records for the tribute it is, and absorb what you can.
1400049628|5.0|This is a very funny book as only Max Brooks could pen. You'll learn everything you ever wanted to know about how to hunt, attack, and kick the living dead. If you ever watched a zombie movie and thought to yourself, \\"Hmmmm, what would I do if I was that character?,\\" then this is the book for you.<br />Brooks covers all aspect of surviving in a zombie infested world like building a fortress, the best place to be during an outbreak, and the best gun to use.<br />I really enjoyed the last section that showed how zombies have existed throughout history and are still around today.<br />A great book that just may save your life someday.

B001FSDOZO|2.0|How many songs can be written about fighting guys that paw your stripper girlfriend while she's at work, or about how crappy your life as a kid growing up in the trailer park with your divorced parents throwing emotional barbs at each other. Your time in the lime light is running short. Find some better lyrics or get off stage.
B0018CWWLE|5.0|What can I say? Well, 15 years was worth the wait, but especially if you watch the VERY well done documentary disk...\\"Why the hell did they wait so long???\\"     I saw this tour in Toronto which was actually, the next live show after this was recorded. What a blast to re live it!  The cinematography is EXCELLENT for a live concert DVD and the sound is nearly flawless.  I was a bit worried that GENESIS would mail this performance in, but boy was I wrong!  Right off the bat w/ \\"Behind the Lines\\" they grab you (it's not really \\"Dukes End; they do more of it!)    Some of the key changes MAY catch some of the musicians off guard; but when you see that on some of them they are actually playing in the new key instead of 'tuning down' that is impressive; it means they basically had to relearn their own songs!  As for highlights??? Yikes! It's one big long highlight!!!! Let's see....The opening medley from \\"Duke'....Land Of Confusion kicks; (the bass isn't synthesized like previous tours or the studio album)   I Know What I Like is still a hoot ...esp w/ old footage behind them.....Home By The Sea is an AWESOME live version.....enjoyed the video 'album ' behind Genesis during \\"Follow you...\\", Ripples is fantastic and very different; new lower key, shortened middle section (which made sense), \\"In The Cage\\" always great, but i missed the slippermen!....Afterglow and Carpet Crawlers weer  very moving...Los Endos was phenominal...esp 'conversation w/ 2 stools\\"    Maybe too much from \\"We Can't Dance\\".....Other than that, it was fantastic....    The documentary was great too.....it shows a lot about the group; their love for each other and their music,a reticent awareness of their place in music history; yet just regular guys.....(Tony suffers from vertigo, Mike has a 'going' problem, and Phil justs wants to be a family guy.    The last part about the rain just shows why a Genesis show is so much more than anyone realizes.  They probably won't tour again because they always feel they have to top themselves and this one is hard to top, but man, do I want more!  Genesis, you are truly a great group and you owe us all NOTHING .....but....C'mon guys....one more!

B000JLSLZQ|5.0|This is just a great DVD. The story and music are really put together just perfect. I have it on Blue-Ray and I'm more then happy with the way it shows and sounds on my 52 inch Sony HDTV with Bose speakers and a Sony blue-ray player.The quality is perfect and could not be any better.
0736063684|5.0|My  brother is a weight lifter (enters constants) and I gave him this book for his birthday. He had never seen a book like this and thought it was an excellent book representing and diagraming all the muscles along with what exercises work each muscle.  I am a runner and have recent added weight lifting to my training program- so I bought a book for myself.  Excellent book for beginners like me and long time weight lifters.
031606792X|5.0|Really, if you have bought the other three in the series, this review is futile to you.... If you have not read the other three books in this series, start with Twilight and proceed forward.  You HAVE to read this book to get any type of closure of the ongoing relationship between Edward and Bella and of course Jacob, and even after you finish, you will still be wanting more and more of this beautiful couple and their story...
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Anyone who has read the book or seen the 1995 tv adaptation of Pride and Predjudice should not bother with this.  Some of the central characters in the story are given about 5 minutes screen time, the costumes were totally wrong and the ending was totally stupid.  My advice to those who haven't bought this yet - use your money for the book or the 1995 tv adaptation instead.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I totally understand why Stephenie Meyer says that the goup MUSE is her muse.  I can't stop listening to their song (which is #1 on the CD).  #5 is also one of my favorites by Mutemath, and of course #10 is just beautiful mostly because Robert Pattinson sings it, just have to hear his voice at least once a day.... Great CD !!!

0316017922|5.0|Book Review submitted by: Stephen J. Hage, SteveH9697@aol.com    Gladwell has a way of looking at the world that's different from the way most of us do.  A large part of his talent lies in his ability to see things that, even though they're there, we tend to miss.  He displayed that unique ability in The Tipping Point and in Blink and delivers, in spades, once again in Outliers.    The book explores people who do things out of the ordinary by delving deeply into how and why they were able to do what they did.  Using his unique way of looking at the world, Gladwell offers surprises few would even think to look for.    In dealing with who gets to the top in the hockey world in Canada, Gladwell looked at the player roster of the 2007 Medicine Hat Tigers.  The salient feature of the roster is that seventeen of the twenty-five players were born in January, February, March or April.  Looking deeper, he shows why that's so.  The eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey in Canada is January 1.  \\"A boy who turns ten on January 2, then, could be playing alongside someone who doesn't turn ten until the end of the year--and at that age, in preadolescence, a twelve month gap in age represents an enormous difference in physical maturity.     This being Canada, the most hockey-crazed country on earth, coaches start to select players for the traveling \\"rep\\" squad--the all-star teams--at the age of nine or ten, and of course they are more likely to view as talented the bigger and more coordinated players, who have had the benefit of critical extra months of maturity.    And what happens when a player gets chosen for a rep squad?  He gets better coaching, and his teammates are better, and he plays fifty or seventy-five games a season instead of twenty games a season like those left behind in the \\"house\\" league, and he practices twice as much as, or even three times more than, he would have otherwise.  In the beginning, his advantage isn't so much that he is inherently better but onlythat he is a little older.  But by the age of thirteen or fourteen, with the benefit of better coaching and all that extra practice under his belt he really is better, so he's the one more likely to make it to the Major junior A league, and from there to the big leagues.\\"    Turns out that in hockey, in Canada as in so many other endeavors, besides talent, timing, circumstances, and luck play a big part in separating winners from losers.    The book is filled with similar stories chronicling what elements, in the lives of people like Bill gates and groups like the Beatles, illuminate how and why they became so spectacularly successful...such outliers.    To be sure, talent is an important and necessary ingredient but, in and of itself, it is almost never enough.    Gladwell's singular strength is the way in which he sees the world.  His writing ability then creates a lens through we get to see the same things he sees.    This is a good read and I recommend it without reservation.

1594201927|5.0|Book Review submitted by: Stephen J. Hage, [...]    In THE ASCENT OF MONEY Niall Ferguson illuminates a universal truth: Everybody is familiar with money but very few truly \\"know\\" anything about it.  This is interesting and, viewed from the appropriate perspective--frightening.    If you don't believe that, think about the recent global financial collapse.    Adoption of and adaptation to the innovation of credit and debt was as important to civilization as any technological innovation and, even though that's as true today as it was when the ideas first germinated, money, for all its power and majesty is a myth.    The only reason money or its legal representation in the form of stocks and bonds has any value at all is because we choose to believe that's true.    Ferguson paints a vivid historical perspective of what money is, why it's so important and how it has come to define civilization.    More than anything else money is an idea writ large; as transformative as the renaissance and the industrial revolution and more dangerous than the atomic bomb.    It is and always has been representational.  In ancient Babylon, money was represented with clay tablets.  Today it exists primarily as ones and zeros residing on disk drives scattered around the globe.    Large financial transactions be they personal, national, international or global rarely involve the exchange of anything physical.  Certainly pieces of paper come into play but, more often than not, they simply serve as a receipt which represents ones and zeroes writ small on the iron oxide substrate of a hard disk drive.    The power and fragility of the money myth are what enable civilizations to prosper and to go horribly wrong through the creation of bubbles that create enormous wealth when they inflate and dystopian devastation when they burst.    In this book Ferguson helps us to understand why this is so.  The key benefit of reading it is, after you have, you truly will \\"know\\" a lot more about money than you did before you read it.  Read this book and dare to know.
B000FS9MV0|3.0|This young lady has a wonderful full voice.  This CD has been in the works for a long time and now I wonder if it is the fact that it pales in comparison to her earlier works as to why they held it back.  Still has a great voice, but there is definitely something missing.  Hopefully there will be another CD soon that will offer, the listener, a much greater chance to hear that beautiful voice.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|I bought Pyramid and I Robot by Alan Parsons Project and have really enjoyed them both.  But I have got to say that Eye in the Sky is the best CD out of these three.  The music stands strong on its own even with all the new groups that are out now.  I love the guitar licks!  The words are even more appropriate today in regards to what is going on in the world.  It is like they had the gift of seeing into the future when you listen to \\"Children of the Moon\\".  I love the chorus in \\"Eye In The Sky\\" as the words and tune really stay in your mind.  Also, 1/3-1/2 of the NBA plays or used to play the instrumental song \\"Sirus\\" when they  introduced their teams.  The Bonus Demo Tracks are quite good too.  So, you won't go wrong purchasing this CD.
B00003CWL6|4.0|My intial reaction of American Beauty was not really.  It took me a long while to think this movie over, and I must say that American Beauty is a movie that will deliver again and again.  It's not as realistic as people make it out to be, but American Beauty easily transcends these petty complaints with acting, themes, film making.<br /><br />The acting is top notch, and a joy to watch.  Kevin Spacey is brilliant, this is the one that made me always keep my eyes out for any movies that he is in (of course, not all of them are good, but that's not the point).  Just watch the facial expressions, the anger, and the bite that these people put into their lines.  Few movies include such stirring performances, which is just one reason why I can never stop watching this movie.  The fantastic acting is further driven by a script crammed to the brim with top notch dialogue to boot.  Oh sure, it's not Quentin Tarantino, it's better (well maybe not, but it's brilliant).  It's not as rich as his dialogue, but pretty much every line on this is biting, sad, angry, and emotional.  Of course, there's plenty of lines thrown in, to well, you know, add a sense of realism, lines necessary to communicate.(come on, there is no such thing as a person who speaks in non-mundane his whole life).  Thank god, thank god.<br /><br />American Beauty is not a visually striking film in the vein of Fight Club or Eraserhead (especially on first viewing), but once you study the movie a bit and listen to the INSIGHTFUL commentary, the film making aspect will impress.  The camera angles, the lighting effects, the use of all of these is a testament to the expansive pallet of film-making.<br /><br />Another extremely strong point that adds to the movies emotional effects is the absolutely fantastic soundtrack.  I'm not talking about the soundtrack of other artists, which doesn't exactly feature a soundtrack on the par with Quentin Tarantino's mix tapes (though it features some good songs).  I'm talking about Thomas Newman's brilliantly exotic, maudlin, and sentimental score.  It's rife with exotic percussion instruments, and it transcends the movie into a somewhat mystical aura that's utterly jaw-dropping at it's best.  If there's anything that makes the pretentious paper bag scene stike a chord in the firm believers (it's a nice tune to listen to on my own without the paper bag scene _______ up everything).<br /><br />American Beauty really a movie that, despite it's out-there protagonist and psycholigcal leanings, delivers again and again, thanks to fantastic direction and entertainment.  The film can be critized, but it's hard to ignore the many assets this movie has.  And of course, the bonus features only add to the movie, especially that commentary.  It's one of the best movies of the ninties, especially coming from a decade with such movies as Pulp Fiction and Silence of the Lambs.  Absolutely worth watching.<br /><br />Also, the Boston Celtics logo rip-off is probably the worst thing I have ever seen in my life.  Give me a break. Can you at least rip the logo off of the Sacramento Kings or the Los Angeles Clippers, or even the Utah Jazz (Lakers will be NBA champions!!!!!)?  Celtics deserve more respect than that (Being a Lakers fan, I respect and even like the franchise and it's players.  Some of the fans are a different story).<br /><br />B+illiantly exotic, maudlin, and sentimental score.

0446581348|3.0|This book is pretty and for the average person looking for a solid makeup primer it is problably a good buy but, as a new makeup artist looking for instruction on contour and highlighting and other advanced techniques I found it lacking. The section on concealing and color correcting was useful and some of the more creative looks at the back of the book were good for creative inspiration but beyond that I found myself skimming through most of the applications because they were things I already knew. I was also suprised that there was no mention of foundation primer as from what I understand most artists carry a basic moisturizer and a couple of primers to prep the face rather than a whole bevy of skincare for diffrent skin types. I think i'm going to buy a copy for my teenaged niece because she loves makeup and would love something like this, for myself however, I found the older but suprisingly timeless books by the late Kevyn Aucoin to be much more helpful.
B001GAOY5U|2.0|The movie was just plain boring. I need to watch the original again to compare but this was just painful to watch. I was hoping something striking was about to happen. Don't waste your time. No hit on Brenden Frasier who is a great actor; this is just a bad movie, in my opinion.
031606792X|5.0|The final book in the series is the best yet.  It is very long, but I wanted it to be longer.  I'm reading it again as soon as I can.  Thanks, Stephenie Meyer.  You are an awesome writer!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is probably the best comedy series on tv - EVER! It makes me smirk, laugh out loud and even (bless my husband) snort into his dinner!    It is witty, sarcastic and charming in equal measure. The characters are loveable and you get invovled in their lives very quickly. Their complete lack of social understanding is great to watch (particularly Sheldon).    I look forward to the show being on every week and think series 3 is the best yet - Leonard's mother is brilliant and the friends link between Penny and the lads develops nicely.    Hope there are many more to come!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I received my Dvd 2 days ago. The first day was hard, the cardio being the worst, but once you figure out that its only 30 seconds per workout and dont count the seconds, they fly by. The second day I found that doing the workouts actually made my sore body feel better and now (day 3) I cant wait to do the workouts because it makes me feel less sore while doing them. I was weak after the first one, but besides just being sore, after the second workout I wasnt nearly as shaky. It feels great! I recommend this DVD to all my co-workers that are wanting to lose weight. I dont know about her promise to lose 20 lbs in 8 weeks, but we'll see in 8 weeks!
B000025H0Q|5.0|What can I say about Nick Drake that hasn't been said?<br /><br />It was very late one night. I was writing at my computer with the radio on. Suddenly there was this beautiful song by a woman. I was instantly captured by it. So I got the phrase \\"gonna see the river man. Gonna tell him all I can.\\" I typed it into Google and discovered the amazing Nick Drake. The radio song was a cover version.<br /><br />Funny it took seconds for me to become a fan. And within minutes I was here at amazon.uk ordering his albums. What a amazing song writer and singer. Then I discovered his recordings were some 40 years old... and it broke me to learn he died back in 1974 in a (accidental) suicide.<br /><br />How can someone like Nick die? It does not enter my mind that the man who wrote all those beautiful and unique songs can simply die. And that was back in 1974! Those songs could have been written today. They haven't aged a month.<br /><br />I would say this one is my favorite album... from a man who never wrote anything below brilliant. ONE OF THESE THINGS FIRST and the sweet SUNDAY are my favorite tracks. I cannot grow tired of this. On the other hand, I'm very happy to know he is getting today the recognition he deserves.<br /><br />The songs are so sharp and intimate you can almost recreate the feeling (if such a thing is possible). The singing is so full of truth. The arrangements are so tasteful. Nick Drake is the rare kind of Artist who really connects. There's no noise. Just the full experience.<br /><br />God bless you, Nick!<br />You did it!
B001F7MSF2|5.0|Guillermo Del Toro has become the new master of dark fantasy -- first with the quirky clockpunk \\"Hellboy,\\" then with the Oscar-winning \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" Not to mention forthcoming travels to Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So you know he has the skills to pit Mike Mignola's scarlet anti-hero against an army of fairies and elves, and not make it silly. Instead, it's a spectacular dark fantasy full of humor, action, quirky appeal, romance, and some truly astounding special effects. But what really shoves this movie over the top is Del Toro's brilliant direction, and the stunning performance by Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Decades ago, Professor Broom (William Hurt) told a small Hellboy a yuletide bedtime story about the Elf King Balor and his unstoppable Golden Army, and how the crown that controls the Army was split into thirds and divided among fairies and humans. Well, you can't really expect that kind of power to never be revived.<br /><br />Cut to current day. Hellboy (Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) investigate a strange supernatural attack on an auction house, where the archeological curiosity known as the Crown of Bethmoora was being sold -- only to be attacked by savage tooth fairies. Turns out the crown was stolen by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), a resentful young elf who is determined to take the world back from humanity -- using, of course, the Golden Army.<br /><br />And while Hellboy chafes against strict new commander Johann Krauss (a suit filled with ectoplasm), Abe encounters Nuada's sister, Princess Nuala -- who also happens to have the last third of the crown. But Nuada will not allow anyone to oppose him as he searches for the Golden Army's location, and Hellboy and his friends must venture into a strange, ancient kingdom to stop him from destroying all of humanity.<br /><br />The worst you can say about \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is that it sticks to the formula of the demonic outsider with a dark destiny, and his continuing romantic woes. There's some retreading as Hellboy realizes anew that he'll never fit into the world of humans, because he's big and red and has horns and a tail. Okay, we got it. Next big psychological issue!<br /><br />Fortunately those flaws are relatively minor ones. Del Toro is still able to spin a dark, twisted story with some truly bizarre creatures (the utterly alien, eye-winged Angel of Death), clockpunk robots, trippy underground goblin markets and a new BPRD agent who is basically ectoplasm in a suit. And for the action scenes, Del Toro does not pull punches when it comes to the smashing action scenes -- giant thrashing vines and a one-on-one duel with Nuada are among the highlights.<br /><br />With all this going on, it would be easy to neglect the characters. But Del Toro packs the script with solid snappy dialogue and some poignantly romantic moments -- including some pretty startling actions from dear ol' Abe. And he also adds little moments to this epic story that remind us that these are supposed to be people -- such as Hellboy's bickering with Krauss, or Abe and Hellboy getting drunk and having a little Manilow singalong together. It's just so cute.<br /><br />But what really sets this movie apart is the \\"children of the Earth.\\" No flitting Victorian sprites -- these are creatures that are weird, grotesque, dangerous and immensely powerful, from nasty little tooth fairies up to vast rock monsters and plant gods. There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of \\"big Red\\" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable. There are more hints of his potentially dark future, and he faces some delicately-handed temptations. But Big Red's good heart is still very much in the forefront, no matter how much human beingsfear him.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, while Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom. Pretty good villain, since he clearly isn't trying to be bad.<br /><br />This is the ultra-mega-super-whatever edition of this movie, which basically means that you get a giant cube crammed with stuff. Aside from the blu-ray (with its wealth of features and behind-the-scenes stuff) you also get a nice poster, a Del Toro \\"journal\\" of inspiration and thoughts on the film, and a little statue of a Golden Army robot. The statue seems a bit flimsy, but otherwise the Limited Edition is pretty good.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision.z, who also has some surprising developments in store.

The statue seems a bit flimsy, but otherwise the Limited Edition is pretty good.    \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision.
B001IMFHTS|4.0|First, about the music: the performances here are totally solid and first-class. For the first 8 symphonies Abbado uses a small orchestra to mimic what was used in the Beethoven days. Just some members of each section of the B.P. appear in each symphony, which gives the music a very coherent tone and dynamics as well as purity not heard when over 100 musicians perform these same pieces. (We must always remember that Beethoven never intended his symphonies to sound Wagnerian.) Abbado's style is very easy on the eye, unlike Toscanini or Karajan.<br /><br />However, as with all these classical concert DVDs, the camera angles are very limited and poor. 95% of the time the camera focuses on just a few members of the orchestra. Granted, not all classical musicians are video-genic, but it's a total sin in a classical music video when, as an instrument or section of instruments take center stage in the music, our attention is diverted to other parts of the orchestra, or only to the conductor. (Several symphonies feature an additional \\"conductor-only\\" angle.) I find it much more satisfying to enjoy these DVDs with my TV monitor turned off!<br /><br />A worthy addition to any Beethoven lover's collection.
0783226837|4.0|There are worse things than living in Perfection, Nevada. For instance, thirty-foot-long burrowing man-eating worms with snake tongues.<br /><br />And sadly our heroes have both problems in \\"Tremors,\\" a dark-comedy/cult-horror flick that has no pretenses of being anything other than what it is -- a wonderfully twisted movie about big gross monsters that explode out of the ground if you step on it. Ron Underwood keeps the worm attacks going all the way to the end, along with splatters of monster gore, exploding floorboards, and lots of rock-paper-scissors.<br /><br />Hired-hands Earl (Fred Ward) and Val (Kevin Bacon) are intent on getting out of the sun-baked, dead-end town of Perfection, especially since they're the guys everyone hires for the grossest jobs.<br /><br />But then they encounter a pair of men who died under bizarre circumstances -- and when they rush back to warn the other citizens, a grotesque snake-creature is found on their truck. With the phone lines dead and the road blocked, Val and Earl try to ride horses to the nearest town -- only to discover that the snake-worm-thing is actually one of the tongues of a vast subterranean worm that sucks people down and eats them. Ew.<br /><br />With the help of grad student Rhonda (Finn Carter), the guys manage to elude the marauding worms and discover a foolproof way of staying out of their reach. Unfortunately staying indoors isn't enough to stop the worms: they're capable of detecting the slightest vibration, strong enough to rip the town apart, and smart enough to figure out a way. But how can Val and Earl get the Perfectionites out of the town without being eaten by worms? For this, they'll need a PLAN!<br /><br />\\"Tremors\\" is not a brilliant movie, nor is it a deep or groundbreaking one. It's just a thoroughly entertaining little movie about monstrous man-eating worms and how to avoid being eaten by them... which sounds like a rather dull concept for a movie.<br /><br />Fortunately Underwood has a fantastic sense of tension and suspense. At first, he drops in some wonderfully gruesome demises without actually showing the monster (jackhammer and orange blood! Buried station wagon!) and fakes out the audience with a \\"snake\\" on the axle. But when the graboids appear for real, all hell (pardon my French) breaks loose -- splatters of gore, some nasty deaths, vast ravenous worms, and a fun climax involving homemade bombs and (for once) a viable plan.<br /><br />What really sets it apart is the excellent writing (\\"Something to keep 'em busy, like a... like a decoy!\\" \\"Hey Melvin... wanna make a buck?\\"). Well, that and its extremely quirky sense of humor (money-savvy Chang setting up a \\"be photographed with the big gross worm\\" kiosk\\") -- you have to love how Earl and Val handle every problem, be it breakfast or suicide runs, by playing rock-paper-scissors. The only quirkiness that falls flat is the pole-vaulting scene.<br /><br />Bacon and Ward do an excellent job as a pair of very, very rural hired-hands who aspire to a better life (IE, not draining sewage tanks), and frankly their characters would be cartoonish or obnoxious in lesser hands. Carter makes a good down-to-earth love interest (\\"Why do you keep asking me?\\"), and Reba McIntyre and Michael Gross are absolutely brilliant as the kooky survivalists who are prepared for anything.

0307454894|4.0|This is a fairly simple easy reading. I wasn't involved with the characters. The author told his story and I felt very distant from everybody. I could understand where he is coming from, but I didn't relate with the author's drive.     Everything was gelid. Gelid way of love, gelid way of killing people, gelid way to live in general. But it still caught my interest. There are some interest topics as, for example, the post-war German generation having to come to terms with what their parents did.     I liked the book. Not spectacular, but readable and above the average.    PS. I haven't seen the movie yet.
0553381687|5.0|This is an awesome book, an inspiration in the genre. It's powerful, complex, compelling, intelligent, and a solid read. In short, it's one of the best fantasy books you can buy.<br /><br />What's good about it? It introduces a very interesting and unique sort of plot that breaks convention, the morality is complex and ambiguous, the prose and mechanics of the writing are top notch, the style was gripping and sometimes humorous, dialogue is top of the line, the characters were very three-dimensional, and the sheer complexity of the work alone is an interesting element.<br /><br />Lastly, I liked the vast number of POV characters that the author introduced, rather than simply one. George Martin did a good job at showing the different viewpoints from different people and giving them all their own unique voice. Be ready to concentrate and remember while you read, though, because you'll need to keep track of a lot of different characters, not to mention the backstory, worldbuilding, and minor characters. The outline of the great houses at the back of the book is helpful for this.<br /><br />The pacing of the story wasn't extraordinary, but still good. If anything bothered me, it was the rather slow movement of the story. Though not bad, it would have benefitted by having things happen faster and having a little less detail. As it is, I think the author is enjoying himself too much as he writes the interaction between the characters, and wants to do it as much as possible. I also a minor quibble that Bran was a bit bland and lifeless, so his chapters seemed like a bit of a waste.<br /><br />A few words of warning: If you like your heroes and want them to live, this book may not be for you. There are enough characters that any of them might come out on top in the end, and Martin doesn't seem to think his books complete unless he kills at least two of them in each novel.<br /><br />There is also quite a bit of violence, language, and sexuality in this book. Though not quite as graphic or nasty as Terry Goodkind's series, it might turn off some readers, especially more sensitive ones.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's hard to go wrong with this book, which is currently one of the best in the genre. It's probably the best in the series, too, considering the direction the sequels go.it might turn off some readers, especially more sensitive ones.

B000001G8R|5.0|This release by Claudio Abbado is  a complete set of overtures, some of them rarely recorded and as such,valuable for any lover of Mendelssohn. At least four of these are of exceptional beauty and much favoured by the great conductors, notably Sir Thomas Beecham who excelled in playing them.<br />Although the playing of the London Symphony is beyond praise, I still have some issues with this disc. Abbado is a very serious conductor, perhaps too serious for some of these works. For example Beecham's playing of Fair Melusine is light hearted,relaxed and easy going and the overture ends in beautiful pp, like a breeze. A memorable performance.<br />But Abbado, although thoroughly musical, drives the piece too seriously and I find the performance less genial. Midsummer Night is even more controversial with the breakneck speed Abbado dictates. I don't think I ever heard it played that fast. The result is very unMendelssohnian,rushed and uncomfortable. Again great credit goes to the Orchestra whose strings can cope with this tempo in steady pp!<br />Abbado however does create some great moments, a sense of mystery in the development section with the faraway accented wind calls.<br />The Hebrides is beautifully done with capturing the undulating wave motion<br />right at the outset and elucidating all the contrasting moods of this, the best of Mendelssohn's overtures.<br /><br />As an afterthought after a hiatus of over two years I should like to modify my opinion in a more positive direction.<br />In fact Abbado's performance of the unjustifiably neglected 'Meerestille und Gluckliche Fahrt' Overture is a revelation, it's so magnificent that it instantly became a favorite of mine! In addition there are two rarities, one for wind orchestra where the London woodwinds and brass are simply amazing in virtuosity.<br />All in all, this is an outstanding disc emphasizing Abbado's unusual ability to bridge over lesser quality music and making it more integral to the whole:  a rare gift in a conductor.gift in a conductor.
B0014CQNTK|5.0|This is a rare kind of movie where almost every character is like a real person and not like a pre-baked stereotype. When I watch most movies, the motives of the characters are painfully predictable because they follow certain prescribed guidelines. Juno, much like Clerks, is the opposite. You know more or less what the characters are like but you don't really know what they'll do until they do it. There are not nearly enough movies like this. Highly recommended!
B0013FSL3E|4.0|I enjoyed this movie with my son when it first came and he was happy when I purchased for him on DVD.    The DVD did skip at one point but he did not mind too much; this why I am giving it four stars.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|What could be!!Family entertainment at it's endearing best.  There's a little Wall-e in every one's heart.  Well done Pixar /and  Disney
B001V9LRTM|5.0|The director's cut adds approximately 45 minutes to the film--a landmark documentary with Martin Scorcese showing his chops as a film editor and Michael Wadleigh lovingly retooling his masterpiece.  The 'times' are evoked with precision, humor and objectivity.  This is not a pure gush.  The balance between music and interviews/commentary/vignettes is approximately 60/40, with standout performances from The Who,  Joan Baez, Santana, Jimi Hendrix, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Ten Years After, Canned Heat, Joe Cocker, et al.  It is not a 'greatest hits' compilation, since some of the greatest hits did not yet exist, but the editing, the split screen images and the atmospherics are superb.  This is not an ode to hippiedom, though some might see it as that.  It is a beautifully shot, loving documentary, with the love bestowed on the music and the strange attractions of human behavior.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I'm in my 60,s and I just sang my heart out with the story.  Top actors, top songs .Well put together
B001TOD92C|5.0|I wasn't going to review this because there are already so many other reviews giving praise to the film but what the heck, I'll put in my 2 cents worth as well.  I rented the movie from Blockbuster on Tuesday, April 21 when it came out for rental.  I had heard great things about it but wasn't certain what to really expect, after all, it is a movie.  I no longer watch wrestling but I was a big fan of it back in the 80s when it rose to great popularity.  I could not imagine any other actor in Hollywood who could have outdone Mickey Rourke'e performance as Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson.  He had the look, the talk, the bleached blonde long hair, so prominent in 80s wrestling and not only the superficial things but the depth of emotion displayed by the actors Rourke, Marisa Tomei (Randy's love interest who works as a 40 something stripper - although she still looks great) and Evan Rachel Wood (Randy's estranged daughter) whom he has abandoned most of her life.  The acting abilities, the real, heart-felt emotions the actors display are spot-on superb.   Randy was a big star back in the 80s and fast forward 20 or so years and he is no longer the main-eventer that he once was.  His body is not what it once was so he reverts to some steroid use.  He still wrestles but mostly at small indpendent shows and also works on the side at a grocery store deli counter where he is totally disrespected by his boss, a balding nerdy-looking jerk who loves to rib Randy about his wrestling career.  Randy lives in a run down trailer park but the local kids appear to love him and he even has one young fan who is still willing to spend time playing an old Nintendo wrestling game (featuring none other than \\"The Ram\\" himself).  After suffering a heart attack, Randy visits Pam (known as Cassady at the strip club) and tells her of his plight.  He also tells her he doesn't want to be alone.  She encourages him to talk to his daughter telling him that he needs to be with his family at this time.  At first, things don't go well with his daughter, she disses him and tells him to get lost (putting it politely).  Once again he talks to Pam and tells her he thinks a gift for Stephanie (the daughter) might be helpful.  Pam agrees and they go shopping together and share a beer and reminisce about the good old days especially the rock music (the 80s) at a local bar.  Things seem to get better with Stephanie until Randy is put off by Pam because she doesn't want to get emotionally attached to him for fear of upsetting her plans for a better life.  She tells Randy that she has a young child to look out for and responsibilities but inside she is really fighting her own feelings for Randy.  He forgets the dinner date he has set with his daugher and needless to say she is not happy about it.  I am not going to say any more because I have already given away a good bit of the movie, so you will need to watch it to see the rest and the \\"surprise\\" for lack of a better term ending.      I saw an interview with Mickey Rourke where he stated that he did many of the stunts himself and even actually \\"gigged,\\" (I always heard it called blading) or cut himself in the forehead with a razor blade.  That surprised me greatly because most actors don't go to those kinds of extremes to make a movie look realistic.      In summary, it is fine film with a lot of raw emotion from the three main characters, Rourke, Tomei and Wood.  The movie is about love, love/hate, sacrifice and a man trying but not always succeeding in redeeming himself against some pretty big odds.  You don't have to be a wrestling fan to enjoy this movie. And...I would have given it 10 stars if possible, it's that good. Enough said.

B0015XASFS|4.0|The Cd was shipped quick and was brand new. I liked the cd very much.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|Upfront caveat:  I have never listened to the music of Metallica, yet I consider this an excellent documentary that brings us into the heart and soul of how a band works together (or not) and creates music.    Maybe because I've never heard the music of Metallica, and know next to nothing of the band is precisely why I found this documentary so insightful and moving.  I would say enjoyable, except that parts of it where the band members really bare their soul and open up to each other are like having a bandage ripped off a healing wound - very painful and exposes the raw nerves beneath it.      I am a fan of documentaries, and one of the things that fascinates me is how people work.  Most work is boring, but not making music.  In this film, you can actually see how a song is built from the ground up that starts with just a phrase or riff, and how the song slowly takes shape and morphs into something new and alive.      I thought the band members were fairly spoiled and self-indulgent, but then, who wouldn't be if you were adored by millions of fans and had millions in the bank?  I was a little surprised that given the tensions within the band that they had even bothered to stay together - kind of reminding me of the Beatles last days, when they could barely stand to be in the same room together.      The drummer's father, an eccentric-looking avant-garde artist in his own right, makes a short appearance in the film, but he is truly one of the film's highlights.  He listens thoughtfully to a new song the band has just completed.  He frowns, then says in his heavy Danish accent, \\"I think with this song, just push delete\\".  His son Lars looks at his father in a bewildered way and says plaintively, \\"But this is our best song\\".  Very funny stuff.     In short, I think you might enjoy this film even if you are not a fan of Metallica's music.
B001SN78JO|2.0|Basically, Yes Man is a rip-off of Liar,Liar, so I won't bother you with the transparent attempt to recycle the script using a different situation. Not only that, but unlike Liar, liar, the script itself was terrible. There was nothing Carey could have done to salvage such bad material other than write it himself. Why he accepted the project at all is beyond me. It was embarrassing, really, and I love Carey's work...which is why it got the two stars.
0930289234|5.0|There's little I can say that hasn't already been said about this brilliant piece of literature - yes, literature.  The story is as deep as anything written by Tolstoy or Dostoevsky, as good as \\"War and Peace\\", or \\"Crime and Punishment\\".<br /><br />I've read it three times and am nowhere near figuring out all the meanings, layers, and sub-layers within this story; although I'm fairly sure that some of the key themes include the important, eternal issues: \\"What is good and evil?\\", \\"What is the best way to do good in the world?\\", and \\"How do I know if I am doing good things or bad things in a world this complicated?\\".<br /><br />I am not a huge graphic novel fan, I tend to read classic literature and non-fiction.  However, this book is as compelling as any book considered to be great literature.  Heck, it's even better than most of Shakespeare's plays.  And I'll admit, the artwork is pretty great as well.
0879309210|4.0|Overall a very good guide. It took some practice, but I did a complete setup for the first time in a few hours using this book. It explained anything that could (and would) go wrong, how to fix or compensate for the problem, and get the most out of the guitar. This is opening a whole new guitar hobby for me--fixing them up.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I agree with some of the other reviews I've read... when I first watched this, I just could not get enough.  I saw the same tour in 1994 at the Rose Bowl, and it's just as amazing now as it was then.  This is hands down my favorite DVD.<br /><br />There's been a couple versions of Pink Floyd in recent years, and I'm sure the PF purists out there may have some problems with this line-up.  I do not.  This is the David Gilmour version, seamlessly blending newer tracks from The Division Bell and A Momentary Lapse of Reason, with the older classics.  Great to see Nick Mason and the late Richard Wright, along with an amazing band.  This one's a must!
B001676320|5.0|I have never enjoyed a concert on DVD such as this one! The hits just keep a coming!!! The best part of the concert is when Chicago and Earth Wind & Fire get together on stage and play on each other's songs. You can tell that they are having a great and fun time together. I was bummed that I missed this concert in 2004 BUT they are gonna' do it again in Summer 2009 and I will be there baby!!!!...Sweeeeeeet!

B000B8657S|5.0|When I started collecting the Hyperion Schubert recital or program disks back in 1987 or '88 with the Janet Baker and Stephen Varcoe programs, I wonder whether it might be just another of those well-intended, ambitious, \\"complete edition\\" projects, whether in music or book publishing, that never quite sees its way to completion.  Still, nothing would be lost in acquiring thees well-produced disks one by one, even if the series never reached the end -- great music, fine performances by stellar interpreters.  In fact, it was a pleasure (sort of a game of anticipation) to check the Hyperion adverts in Gramophone magazine each month to see if a new disk was to be issued the next month.      Hyperion's and Graham Johnson's dedication saw the project through 37 program/recital disks, plus the Schubert friends and contemporaries set.  And then came the chronological set forecast by Johnson in notes an earlier program/recital disk (he and Hyperion proved good as their word).  (Since then, he's completed his Schumann series too.)    Enthusiasm has led me acquire both complete Schubert sets:  the program/recital disks and the chronological set. If I were forced to do so, it would be hard to choose between them:  each gives you a particular view of Schubert.  The individually issued disks focus on a theme Schubert explored (classical mythology, Schiller, Goethe, the annus mirabilis 1815, etc.) and usually (though not always) a single singer.  Three generations of Schubert interpreters have participated.  Some budding Schubert singers made early appearances in the series and later flowered into the current ruling generation of performers.  Ian Bostridge for example appeared first in a Schubertiad disk and later, joined with Fischer-Dieskau as reader, scaled the peak of Die Schoene Muellerin.  Mathias Goerne is another, who appeared in a recital disk and then moved on to Die Winterreise.  There were also beautiful performances by voices now no longer performing (e.g., Peter Schreier or Edith Mathis) or, sadly, silenced by death (Arlene Auger or Lucia Popp).      Hyperion has seen through a grand project, grandly realized.  To cap the climax, I can't wait for publication of Johnson's companion volume, encompassing and supplementing the research evident in his CD-booklet notes:  enquiry with Yale University Press indicates it will be issued in 2010.  (It should be a worthy companion to Johnson and Stokes' A French Song Companion, Oxford:2000.)    If you can afford the $1000 or so needed to get both sets, take a deep breath and do so:  you'll be glad you did.  (I had the good fortune to be able to do expense it in dribs and drabs, so it's easy to say \\"get both\\" I realize.)  But, if Schubert's historical development is what interests you more, then the chronological boxed set is a wonderful experience, available nowhere else.  On the other hand, acquiring all of the individual issues, dating back to 1987, gives you the astonishing experience of recitals by the cream of Schubert lieder singers for the last half of the 20th Century.  In either case, you get the governing genius of Graham Johnson, worthy successor of the great Gerald Moore.  I own thousands of lieder and French, English, Slavic, Spanish, and Italian classical song recordings, the two Hyperion Schubert sets, taken together, are the centerpiece.
B001DU8T6S|4.0|And yes, I know it was never intended to be Queen as they were. Overall I think it's a solid classic rock album by a talented group of journeymen rockers. I just miss the soaring heights of fancy and passion that Queen rose to with Freddie at the helm. Paul is an awesome singer and writer, but, it's just not the same kind of magic. I hope with the next release they stretch a bit more and push to capture some of that magic again. Bring in more sidemen if necessary to make it happen. Gotta remember not only Freddie is missing from the recipe, but John D. as well. As a fellow bass player I miss him maybe most of all.
B000OHZJKK|5.0|Someone else may have mentioned this already, but if not, I think many have overlooked a most important component of the genesis and passion of this album.  Let me see if memory serves...    As I recall, this album was indeed the boom following the lit fuse dynamite of the first album, but where did all the intensity come from?  Very much like Frank Sinatra's masterpiece recording In the Wee Small Hours, which was born of a broken heart, This Year's Model was the result of the breakup of Elvis' love affair with famed international model Bebe Buell.  The cover says it all and it's right there staring you in the face.    Frank nearly lost his mind over the breakup with Eva Gardner, the absolute one and only love of his life.  The pain and misery he felt drove him to a level of intensity and passion in his delivery and arrangements never before heard from the Chairman of the Board.    Like Frank before him, Elvis too suffered deeply when Bebe chose her career over him - just listen to the words of Lipstick Vogue.  Most of the album was a love lost song to Bebe.  It stands out in my mind as truly one of the great albums to come out of the '80's and remains one of my very favorites.
1416550542|5.0|Part of The Forgotten Garden is reminiscent of Frances Hodgson Burnett's, The Secret Garden published in 1911. An unwanted cousin finds herself at her uncle's manor house, where she develops a bond with a sickly and lonely cousin. The similarity between the two novels ends there.     Like Morton's, The House at Riverton, The Forgotten Garden shifts back and forth through time and attempts to solve a mystery that occured over a hundred years ago. The House at Riverton's mystery was the death of poet, Robbie Hunter. The mystery in this novel is why Ivory Walker, a four year old year old girl from a wealthy and aristocratic family, was abandoned and placed on a ship to Australia.     Ivory Walker grows up to be Nell. On her eighteenth birthday, her father revealed a secret which ended her life as she knew it - not only was Nell not his real daughter, neither he or his wife knew Nell's real identity. She was found on the docks when she was four years old. The only link to her past is a little white suitcase the child carried on her when she was found.     Cassandra, Nell's granddaughter, inherits the mystery surrounding her grandmother's lost identity. After the elderly Nell dies, Cassandra embarks on an adventure in the Cornish countryside in an attempt to put together the pieces of Nell's past. Crucial to the mystery is a childrens book author by the name of Eliza Makepeace, who Nell not only vaguely remembers was the last person she saw before she boarded the ship, but her little suitcase also contained a book written by the mysterious authoress.     I loved the way the author scattered subtle clues throughout the book. I guessed the big mystery long before it was revealed, but it didn't make the novel any less compelling. Ms Morton knows how to write a mystery that will grab you from the start.     The only gripe I have with The Forgotten Garden was the way the author jumped back and forth across generations. The story didn't transition as smoothly as in her previous book. In fact, the decade jumping was downright confusing at times. Still, I cannot bring myself to give this book any less than five stars. Ms Morton has proved herself a master storyteller. I will gladly pre-order any future books this author publishes.
0060594896|2.0|I got this book a couple months ago. It is a mixture of logical principles on how to be succesful with the major principle being \\"Set Goals\\".<br /><br />You could get Earl Nightingale's tapes for free on the internet that will tell you this and much more.<br /><br />Half this book is filled with this phrase: \\"When I wrote Chicken Soup for the Soul, which became a multimillion bestseller...\\", again and again and again.<br /><br />This book reads like a big advertisement to Chicken Soup for the Soul \\"And now we have a CSFTS fom Farmers and one for Pets and one for Mothers...\\".<br /><br />It is boring and slowly paced.<br /><br />Anyway, Jack Canfield belongs to the Bob Proctor school, so I guess it should make more sense to read Bob Proctor instead, or James Artur Ray which is his best student.
B000JKA0B0|5.0|I love the item.  I knew about the shows, but don't get that many chances to see them live since I live in the states.  It was a great oppertunity to watch the brilliant theatre and amazing music that Rammstein brings to a live show.    The photobook was interesting, it was largely of fans, but again I am a huge fan, so just seeing the backstage pictures of the set being put up and the band sitting around in the dressing rooms was worth it.  I think the average fan could live without the limited edition with the photobook and all, but for a fanatic it is a must have.

In the end, Emma though learns the beauty of true love, when'd not meddling in the affairs of others.

1587613379|5.0|The Ethical Slut is incredible!     I first read The Ethical Slut (first edition) as part of a college course. As an undergrad, I was already well on my way to being a proud slut - I did the usual versions of short-term college dating, hookups, friends-with-benefits, threesomes, and the like, with or without a committed partner at various times. It all felt natural and right, but there were invariably awkward moments of poor negotiation, misunderstood communication, and mis-handled jealousy.  When I read The Ethical Slut, I found an amazing wealth of information and suggestions on how I could make my various relationships work better and more smoothly. I wished I'd had this book all along - it would have saved so much trouble! If only I'd known that an agreement to \\"see other people\\" wasn't nearly complete enough! The Ethical Slut lays out all the things to think about in having open relationships of various sorts. I've been called a slut since I was 14, but it was this book that gave me the idea that being a slut could be a good thing - and now I couldn't be happier with my fabulous life as a proud slut.    The Ethical Slut is an entertaining, readable, real-life explanation of all the options in relationships. Whether you want to be single or partnered or grouped, poly or monogamous, or whatever else, this book helps you figure out all the possibilities better. It's THE relationship book for anyone who wants more options than a \\"leave-it-to-beaver\\" relationship.     If you're just starting to explore open relationships, or you're even just thinking about it, there's no better place to start than with this book. And if you're already immersed in poly life, it's got the \\"advanced level\\" information you need. For those who know and love the first edition, the second edition is definitely worth adding to your collection. There's a ton of new information on the really crucial details of how to make all sorts of poly and open relationships work.     The second edition now has exercises exercises, taken from Dossie Easton's work as a therapist with poly folks, that you and/or your partner(s) can work on together. I loved the new section on living as a single slut - which makes the point that sluthood and open loving can be an identity that doesn't require a conventional partnership to secure or ground it. It also offers ideas on how to get one's needs met from a network of friends and lovers - useful information for pretty much anyone. The new segments on handling jealousy and conflict are especially good for those of us who have been involved in poly relationships for some time and need the more detailed info, from the voices of experience, to help through the rough spots. I feel like I'm always learning in poly relationships, and every time I go back to The Ethical Slut, there's some tidbit that helps with the complicated, hard, or unexpected parts of a generally fabulous poly life.     Whether you've read the first edition or not, this is definitely a book you should own. I've read it 3 or 4 times now, and I keep going back to it to check out certain sections that become more relevant as I encounter new poly challenges.     Rather than offering generalities and theories, The Ethical Slut speaks from many people's experience over many decades. It's the real-life information that you need to make all your relationships amazing!!     (and, speaking of making sex and play and relationships amazing, check out some of Dossie Easton and Janet Hardy's other books - The Topping Book, The Bottoming Book, When Someone You Love Is Kinky, and Radical Ecstasy!)
B0026GBIB6|3.0|There are many, many of us that are freakishly devoted DM fans who own every album and thought they were the best band ever. I still buy all the albums. This album is like a good friend: warm, comforting, recognizable. I think this record is the best since 'Ultra' which I loved. These songs are well-structured, sometimes even dare I say \\"simple\\" for Martin. Simple can be a good thing.  The layering is there, the industrial crunchiness is there, the synths are rich and heavy.  The vocals on this album are fantastic, especially the harmonies with Dave and Martin.  But what is disappointing is that they are still doing relatively the same music.  Their sound is now so immediately identifiable because they haven't changed in years. This band used to WOW us every time an album came out because the sounds and the layers and the sampling were all used to maximum affect to create something no one had ever done.  I haven't had the WOW effect now since the first time I heard \\"Never Let Me Down Again\\" from Music for the Masses. Still, there are some gems on this record and after a few listens they get better and better.  It's always nice to have a good friend so close.
0679735909|4.0|Possession is a completely original story, subtitled \\"A Romance,\\" about two scholars who pool their resources to uncover the secret romance between two fictional writers that happened a century before. It is fine drama and detective work, and as the clues accumulate and the pieces begin to fit together, we get a well-rounded sense of who these people were, as well as beautifully-written moments of perception that heighten the reader's awareness of the world around them. It is aided by some of the most gorgeous writing I have ever read, beautiful country settings, and a simple and sweet ending that ties everything together in a neat bow.    However, I would be remiss if I didn't grudgingly admit that this book is oftentimes an absolutely painful bore.     Byatt has a masterly control over the different devices used to tell the story, and as such each different form is unique and pitch-perfect (the fact that Byatt wrote the book straight through speaks of her incredible talents). However, Maud and Roland did not stand out as characters, and were difficult for me to relate to, or even care about. The narrative often halts for countless pages of poetry, or diary entries by peripheral characters, thus laming the story's momentum. Supporting characters like Cropper, Blackadder, and even Val were not very distinct, and tended to gel into eachother as the story progressed. Also, the story seemed ultimately very predictable, making the eleventh hour revelation lack a real punch for the reader.     Still though, I was constantly taken aback by the writing, and oftentimes asked myself \\"How did she think THAT up?\\" Recommmended for readers up for a unique challenge.

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Batman and the Gotham City police have had their hands full trying to take down the mob and now there's a new villain in town, a grotesquely scarred and made-up madman called the Joker.<br /><br />This is a superhero movie that isn't cartoonish or childish; it's complex and intense and thoroughly enjoyable.  Heath Ledger plays the deranged Joker with frightening delight and I couldn't take my eyes off him.  Even though the movie was well over two hours long, I wanted more time with the Joker.  Ledger really found his niche as a super-villain.  Christian Bale is fine, if somewhat bland, as Batman, while Aaron Eckhart shines as the heroic district attorney.  Maggie Gyllenhaal is a disappointing love interest for both Batman and the DA; she has no appeal whatever.  It's fun to see Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman as Batman's confidants; their scenes are riveting.<br /><br />The story moves at breakneck speed with lots of subplots, a huge cast of characters, and explosions and killings aplenty.  The script is literate and even noble and it really is the best Batman movie I've seen.  Highly recommended.
B000094HMU|4.0|For those who are familiar with 'Madame Butterfly' and 'Tosca', 'Turandot' is a considerable hurdle for some opera viewers and lovers. Puccini was the great heir to Verdi, he had established himself with 'Manon Lescaut' and created hits with his verismo works such as 'Il Tabaro' and 'La Boheme'<br /><br />So why is 'Turandot' a hurdle? First it was left unfinished. Puccini died in November 1924 succumbing to throat cancer. Alfano, under the great conductor Toscanini finished the opera. The composer had left behind sketches and notes for the last act. (When you watch the opera, everything is Puccini until Liu's final aria in Act III, scene 1.) So what begins as Puccini ends as what others believe Puccini wanted. Of course it is excellent, true to form and as good as its going to get. Secondly, despite Calaf's and Liu's moving arias (especially 'Nessum Dorma' made famous by the NFL and 'Moonstruck'), the music is getting closer and closer to the modern styles of Strauss, Berg and the atonal crowd of composers of the early twentieth century. Where before we hear the beautiful motifs of Mimi and Rudolfo, flowing in and out of the music, 'Turandot' offers a musical circus of expressions, medleys, tempos. It is a richer Puccini, diverse, eclectic, multicultural but not as endearing.<br /><br />In consideration of the performances, I feel strongly it is Leona Mitchell as Liu that steals the show. As an audience we are drawn to the hero because he challenges Turandot, he wants to solve her three riddles and marry, all at the risk of losing his life. Yes, it is captivating and it keeps us bound to the story. But Domingo as Calaf and Eva Marton as the Princess, although we are satisfied with their performance, not completely moved. Perhaps it is the role of Liu but I'm sure, very positive it was Mitchell's delivery - her singing gave me shivers. This also has to do with Puccini's style at the time. When Domingo and Marton are given the chance to sing, they are closer to the modern whereas Liu's arias feel closer to the earlier Puccini most of us know and love. I fell in love with Mitchell's voice.<br /><br />Domingo's strongest role, I feel is Otello. Here, he is just a little too close to not pulling it off. His 'Nessun Dorma' doesn't have the gravity and power of Pavarotti's. If there were any other weaknesses, it doesn't show until he sings at night about how none shall sleep. Impressive, obviously but it won't shatter through your soul. I still think Domingo is a better actor and his love for the princess is heartfelt.<br /><br />This opera is a satisfying challenge. The staging is excellent, the sets incredible, all the exotic notes are there, the chorus delivers. Zeffirelli's direction is a must-see. It is a visual splendor matched with a haunting fairy tale story. Well worth the time and dedication to know it but truly, keep your eyes and ears open for Mitchell. She makes this production shine.u's arias feel closer to the earlier Puccini most of us know and love. I fell in love with Mitchell's voice.     Domingo's strongest role, I feel is Otello.

B001IAOEXU|4.0|All I have to say about this product is \\"WTF\\" Sony? Why didn't you design your Dualshock triggers THIS WAY to begin with? I only wonder how secure they'll hold in the long run, though.
B001F3FUK6|5.0|I recently re-purchased this movie because mine was just Dolby 5.1. You just can't have that with a movie like this.  Dolby 5.1 sounds like you're watching a movie at home, while truehd audio sounds like you're at the theatre.  Obviously, the better your home theatre system, the more apparent the difference.  Yes, though, this is in fact dolby truehd, and is worth buying again.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|I like this Bond, and he is the epitome of the harshness and down and dirty attitude of what a Bond character should be. Not entirely lacking in the proper British procedure, this Bond is fully knowledgeable in the art of full departure of authourity. I liked the movie, but I was just a little annoyed by its super fast pace and the story line, which I felt could have been punched up with the magic that most of the Bonds acquired from Q division. Each Bond actor has given their all to this worthy character and Mr. Craig is definately a keeper. I look forward to well thought out plots, filled with the gadgetry and the confident and intelligent, \\"James Bond.\\"
B001TOD92C|1.0|Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood, in fact everyone in this movie performs beautifully. I was taken in from the opening shots of the back of Mickey's head, but about two-thirds of the way through the film, I realized that the plot was going nowhere and stopped caring about the character. The script was coming full-circle to where the movie started, and honestly, I'm sick to death of this kind of unfulfilling story writing. I want to see a deadbeat's character switch, even if minutely. I do not want to watch a deadbeat remain a deadbeat for two hours and end up a deadbeat. This plot goes nowhere but back to the beginning, and you would do well to watch Nacho Libre instead (which, incidentally, has an actual plot with a beginning, middle and end, and you will actually have a laugh. At the end of The Wrestler, you'll just want to slit your forehead open with a broken razor blade.).
B001PPLIEG|1.0|I've viewed most of the Bond flicks, I wish I hadn't seen this one.  The 20 movie precedent is meaningless to this director, who feels that he can add the name 007 to any character he likes and get away with it.  The fact that I spent to money to support this man makes me sick to my stomach.  The car chase scene (which was the intro to the movie) though well shot, and had a good action feel, did not embody the liveliness of a bond movie.  No gadgets or add-ons were on this car.  Probably because there was no 'Q' or 'R' character in the movie.  My guess is John Cleese read the script and said there is no way he would ever credit his name to this film, and Desmond Llewelyn is probably rolling in his grave. (god rest his soul)  In addition to this opening, this director felt it unnecessary to feature the classic walkout to his movie (You know where he looks down the barrel of the gun and fires, turning the screen red), instead he added it to the end of the movie, maybe he thought he was being metaphoric, but he really just crapped on the 20 movies before the two he made.  This film offered few puns (a staple of James Bond's character), and the few that he did have sucked pretty bad.  Bond had no gadgets, (not even a watch laser, or cigerette lighter knife, nothing), and really no emotion.  I can't blame Daniel Craig, he just played the character the director told him to.  This director is good at action sequences, which he has a powerful 'over the top' approach to, though not sufficeint to save this film.  If your image of James Bond is an emo kid in high school who goes home and cuts himself, this film will be great for you.  But if you ever saw a 007 flick before Casino Royale, don't waste your money on Quantum of Solace.

B000LF73ZE|4.0|Being intrigued by the movie, I read the translated book.  It is a very small book, but written well. Very simplistic, without the build up and climaxes of most fiction.  Rather, it takes the reader to: \\"what-the-heck\\" and then \\"Now it makes sense.\\"  This teenager becomes involved with a mid-thirties bus conductor.  At her insistence, he reads to her, constantly.  She suddenly leaves and then shows up, years later as a defendent in a trial.  The young man is now a law student studying her trial.  Is she guilty? Probably.  Evil?  No. In her own soldier-like, proud, primitive way, she is the perfect fall guy as we all have seen in history.  The law student, now a lawyer has his own dilemna of protecting a friend or watching her being punished. Given the situation, he does the best that he can while still trying to convince himself of right and wrong.

Why speed dating can be more effective than dating services or viewing a person's home can be more revealing than a 2 hour job interview. This book proves the natural ability that so many of us have to make good, but unexplained decisions.  However, Malcolm Gladwell also explains how our decisions and even self image can be manipulated prior to making decisions.

B00003CXXJ|4.0|The colors in this animated film are beautiful, just spectacular at times. It's just state-of-the-art artwork, which is what we are seeing more and more this century as animated films continue to do well at the box office and impress the public and critics.    In Shrek,the screen sometimes is filled with so many things - especially when all the fairy tale characters are pictured at once - that it's hard to focus on just one. There are lots of extras on the two-disc DVD set, too.    If you liked this, check out the sequel, because it's even better. By the third Shrek, the story had gotten stale but the animation continues to astound, especially with Blu-Ray now available.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|By now, everyone knows about Beowulf, if only because they were forced to read it in high school.  Judging from the audio track of the DVD, some folks clearly resented having to read the \\"boring\\" heroic saga of a man who rips a troll's arm off with his bare hands, slays its monstrous mother, becomes king, and later dies fighting a dragon.<br /><br />There's some odd defensiveness about Beowulf from the directors.  This movie isn't JUST going to be about Beowulf, it will have a tightly wrapped story from beginning to end!  It won't JUST be about a hero slaying monsters, it will be about father and son guilt, mother and son pride, and the lies they tell each other!  There won't JUST be actors, there will be beautifully rendered superbly animated avatars! It won't JUST be a movie, it will be a movie in 3-D!<br /><br />For the most part, it works.  Beowulf and the king who hires him to slay Grendel are at times drunken louts and macho warriors.  Grendel isn't just a disgusting monster, he's a piteous troll-child that throws a deadly tantrum.  And Grendel's mother?  Mmm, Grendel's mother is a delicious golden-skinned incubus who actually sprouts high heels (because, hey, human isn't her real form anyway so why not?) and a slinky tail. Gone is the random moment when Beowulf finds the sword that will slay Grendel's mother just laying around in her treasure horde, a situation I always found a little lazy on the part of the mysterious author. Replacing the somewhat jumbled juxtaposition of heroic mythology and Christian values is a tale of men tempted by lust and greed who go on to father the demons that ultimately destroy them.<br /><br />The three-dimensional effects are lost on my television, a problem that's going to only become more prevalent as movie theaters give up trying to compete with DVDs and switch to gimmicks like 3-D.  This makes some scenes more amusing than exciting, like when a flagpole juts towards the screen at the viewer.<br /><br />The computer graphics, while breathtaking, seem to be almost beside the point.  Yes, it's great that we have Jolie in all her near-naked glory.  But why bother recreating her in CGI at all?  When you watch the making-of docs, the actors acted with props, right down to Crispin Glover tossing dolls around as Grendel.  Was that really necessary?  Do we really care how realistically a warrior swings a lamp (a weighted prop, in case you're wondering) or Grendel tears a man in two?<br /><br />Perhaps the most grating attribute of the DVD is the insistence that Beowulf was \\"boring.\\" That somehow, the producers have made Beowulf better, because reading is dumb and so is high school.  Maybe it's the English major in me, but I found the tone condescending.<br /><br />If you can look past that, Beowulf's an entertaining if somewhat gory tale.  But with its gratuitous nudity, buckets of gore, and significant changes to the plot, it's not going to be shown in high school English classes any time soon.e almost beside the point.

B000286RNY|5.0|This has to be one of the goofiest, dumbest, strangest - and funniest - films ever made! It made sound like a cliché, but you truly have to see this movie to believe it. It's that outrageous, far-out: a slapstick film containing martial arts, supernatural power and the sport of soccer.    We get the usual misfits-make good story, which is nothing new, but how it happens in unlike anything I've ever seen. I can't recall how many times I literally laughed out loud watching these ludicrous scenes. The climactic soccer game at the end got carried away, of course, but it was still fun to watch.    Earlier in the story, the bizarre dialog, odd encounters with different characters and the humor is stupid many times.....but so stupid, it's comical! I just shook my head in amazement at what I was seeing and hearing. Be prepared, as I said, for some incredible dumb things, but also for much weird but definitely entertaining stuff.    Note: I watched the short \\"English theatrical version\\" which runs 89 minutes. You can also view the 112-minute Chinese version. From what I've heard, read, and witnessed, the 89-minute is sufficient. Any more of this insanity would be too much.
1593083246|5.0|Of course Pride and Prejudice is fabulous in any form, but I do like this edition. Barnes and Noble Classics are hardcover with a nice dustjacket. Pages were a nice thickness, and what I especially liked, had that cool binding effect that makes it look like an older edition book where all the pages are different widths at the side.
0780619587|5.0|This was a very interesting movie and pleasant surprise, although sometimes that theme of the obsessive parent driving a kid crazy gets overworked. Nonetheless, it's a very well-made movie.    Geoffrey Rush is fascinating in the lead role as \\"David Helfgott.\\" However, I would give equal kudos to Noah Taylor, who played Helfgott as a teenager, and to Armin Mueller-Stahl, who was Helfgott's father. They were just as impressive as Rush.    This is a supposedly true-life story of child prodigy piano player from Australia. As you can imagine, the music in here is excellent. Even better is the cinematography. Wow, this looks and sounds fantastic on DVD!  I'd love to see a sharp Blu-Ray transfer of this movie.    Although not always pleasant to watch, the story is riveting; hard to put down once you've started watching. In all, a very intense, beautifully-photographed biography.
B001TCAT9U|5.0|I got this cd on the release date and it has been on constant play for the last few days.  This is by far the best album of the year in my opinion.  And one of the strongest Depeche Mode albums of all time.<br /><br />This review is for the expanded edition.  I was skeptical to pay an extra $5 for three mixes, a video and the 5.1 mix.  I was blown away on how good the sound was in surround sound!  This was worth the $5 no doubts at all.<br />The mixes are ok with Little Soul being the standout in my opinion.  I may not listen to the mixes in the future, but it they did add to the value of the cd.<br /><br />As far as the sound goes, Dephece Mode went way back to the classic sound that made them so popular.  Back is the heavy dependence on the synthizezer and gone is the more tradional rock sound of Violator.  The lyrics when listened to are still on the depressing side, but that is what Depeche Mode is known for.<br /><br />If you have fallen off the Depeche Mode bandwagon Sounds of the Universe will get you back on board.  This is a can't miss cd!
B00005KAQP|4.0|I enjoyed this when it came out, just as millions of other folks did. It had a nice feel to it, good humor, great music and it didn't offend, from believer to atheist.  It even had some action scenes. Many movies which combine genres (i.e. action and comedy) wind up successes. It's not a bad formula.    Although Whoopi Goldberg is the undeniable star of this movie, Kathy Najimy as \\"Sister Mary Patrick\\" almost steals the show as the bubbly nun. However, always a sucker for a pretty and wholesome face, I preferred Mary Wickes as \\"Sister Mary Lazarus.\\" She had this shy countenance to her before blossoming with her voice. Maybe that's why she had the name Lazarus as her personality rose from the dead.
