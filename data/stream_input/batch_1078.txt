B003SWNRU2|3.0|There's lot of hype about this record and I would say about 1/2 of it is deserved.  Some of the awe rests on the mighty smooth transition Accept has made with a relatively unknown singer in his 50s (ex TT Quick vocalist).  His abilty to bring power but not sound like an UDO clone is impressive.  The songs are solid but get repetitive and start to sound dated with the sing song/chanting choruses throughout.  The cd is overlong and could have done with some editing but I guess why complain when they do give you a solid amount of metal for one compact disc.
B000002UB3|5.0|From start to finish, front to back,<br />begining to end, this is excellent music.<br />This band can seriously write hit after hit.<br />Amazing stuff really. I don't have a favorite song,<br />they are just to different from one another to compare<br />like that anyway. \\"Shes so Heavy\\" is pretty great,<br />Oh Darlin' is just as great... Come Together has been remade how many times?<br />LOL!!! hmm...<br />no way to compare them, other than these guys ROCK!!!<br />The last few songs of side 2... wow...<br />Oh, one last thing. I bought the 1990 used CD here at Amazon.<br />Don't listen to the naysayers on this one. It is exceptionally<br />crisp and clear, The lows and the bass drum are STROMG as hell.<br />If you can afford the remaster, get it I suppose,<br />but I am 100% happy with this 20 year old CD!<br />5 STARS!!! EXCELLENT!!!
B00454U1NS|5.0|What an awesome singer that Pink is.  She is so herself unlike any other girl singer in the world.  I applaud her for being true to herself and true to the fans.  Keep it up, Pink!!!  You Rock!!!!!
0061733199|5.0|This book is very comprehensive on wilderness, emergency preparedness and survival tactics. A must have reference book for any outdoorsmen.
B003EYVXT6|1.0|This has got to be the worse movie I have ever seen. It took me days to remove those incest/bestiality  images from my head. I've seen bad films but this one totally tops it.
B003ES5ZPK|4.0|It's always the simplest things that come in handy.  When mounting a flat screen there are many problems that arise, the most frustrating being the routing the cables so that they are not seen and are connected securely without tension being placed on them.  This adapter takes care of that in one easy, affordable connector.  I can now route my cables so that they aren't seen and still have a solid fit of the HDMI cable without sacrificing convenience.     The few drawbacks of this adapter take it from being perfect innovation to a great one.  The male end swivel does not do a full 90 degree turn.  The female end swivel does not hold the angle by itself, but flows with the moving of the cable. Overall, I'm very happy with the ease of use of this adapter and definitely find it a good value.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|Who needs anything more than a sonic screwdriver? Exactly! The 10th Doctor's sonic screwdriver is a MUST for all fans. My daughter and I saw a Tennant look-alike at a Renaissance Faire and she thrilled to see that there was a 10th Doctor sonic screwdriver. I gave it to her for her birthday. I have not had more than a quick test of the screwdriver. She, however, keeps it in her Doctor Who coat pocket. She says the sound is good, but not overly loud. The light is decently bright. The body is not too heavy (it is plastic, after all). After giving it a full test, she says does not recommend using the invisible ink on yellow paper. It does not show up well. It does not pick locks.  \\"For a toy sonic screwdriver, it is awesome!\\".
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|Here is another Coldplay album. It is horrible.<br /><br />Hilariously, Coldplay \\"forced\\" themselves to make every song sound different under producer Brian Eno's command. This qualifies as experimentation in the modern rock world.
B003097B64|1.0|Thanks for that very helpful review! When I first saw this product listed on Amazon, my heart skipped a beat. I thought it might have been exactly what I was looking and hoping for. I am the world's biggest fan of mini-lp packaging. For the life of me, I don't know WHY all CDs were not manufacturd and put out in this format, from the beggining!!!!!Then, as I read on, my dream was dashed! No new re-mastering! What an absolute shame!   All I want is for someone, somewhere, to put ALL of the Lowell George era Little Feat albums out, re-mastered and in mini-lp packaging. Everything from \\"Little Feat\\" to \\"Hoy-Hoy!\\". Nine albums, total - is that so much to ask?!   Even The Beatles finally re-mastered their catalogue! Granted it took them 22 YEARS to do it - BUT AT LEAST THEY DID IT!!!!! And at least the mono box set was presented in mini-lp form! Maybe worldwide sales weren't as big as initially anticipated but what did they expect?! Half of their origional fans, which is who they did it for, ARE DEAD AND BURIED!!!!! I guess \\"FEAT\\" are going to wait until we're all dead, too! I've already had one heart attack! I won't be around THAT much longer!  Mobil Fidelity Sound Labs has, at least put out a few of the early albums, re-mastered BUT so far they've only done \\"Little Feat\\", \\"Sailin' Shoes\\", \\"Dixie Chicken\\" and \\"Waiting For Columbus\\". WHY did they skip from \\"Dixie Chicken\\" and go right to \\"Waiting For Columbus\\"?! Are they going to eventually do the rest - \\"Feats Don't Fail Me Now\\", \\"The Last Record Album\\", \\"Time Loves A Hero\\", \\"Down On The Farm and \\"Hoy-Hoy!\\"?!!!!! Most likely - of course not - and why should they? - I'M NOT DEAD YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  One star, for at least attempting the mini-lp packaging! - idiots!
B004927I50|5.0|Speak Now, the deluxe edition, Taylor Swift's latest CD, is most definitely her best yet. Though her first CD started out pretty much being country, and her second started heading into pop, this one is almost a country-esque rock.     Mine is the song everyone knows from the radio, about a girl \\"with a fear of falling\\" meeting a college boy and falling in love. It's happy but not unrealistic; it shows a relationship with its ups and downs.   Sparks Fly is that song that everyone can connect to, that speaks of falling for someone you know you shouldn't, but the chemistry is there and it can't be avoided.  Back To December is her apology to a certain guy (*cough cough*) whose heart she broke. It's the only song that is an apology. It's a beautiful, elegant rendition of something that most of us want to say to at least one person.   Speak Now is a somewhat humorous song about her daydream about breaking up a wedding (\\"and her snotty little family all dressed in pastel...\\" lol).   Dear John is basically self-explanatory; we all know what a dear john letter is, thus, you know the song.   Mean is another easily relateable song. We've all had bullies in our lives. This is the perfect song to sing to ourselves that's kine of like a \\"in your face\\" showoff.   The Story of Us is kind of an odd song. If you just listen to the music, NOT the lyrics, it sounds peppy and happy. But the lyrics are about a relationship that was marvelous that is pretty much turning into a crash and burn scenario. The thing is, it's not really depressing. It's like, \\"yeah, you and I are splitting up, but I'll be okay\\".   Never grow up....again. Self-explanatory  Enchanted is relateable if you've met one person that absolutely awed you.   Better than Revenge is an interesting one, as it comes from the mouth of Taylor Swift, the sweet adorable country girl, lol. Basically, if your boyfriend/girlfriend has left you for someone else/cheated, perfect song for you.  Innocent is thought to have many meanings behind it, including a rumor that it is about Kanye West interrupted Swift at the VMAs, but it has yet to be confirmed. Beautiful song.   Haunted is the one song set to full strings and that has a REAL rock feel. If you've ever felt a relationship slowly fade away...well, the song fits.  Last Kiss would have to be the saddest song on this album. It's about a relationship you thought would never end...but it did. \\"I never thought we'd have a last kiss\\".   Finally, Long Live is my personal favorite on the album. It's a strong song, with so much emotion (happy) behind it. The song is about her band/producers, but if you have a group of friends that have changed your life, its a great song.
B0025KVLRY|5.0|With The Beatles - what to say?  It's great music from start to finish.  Terrific originals and superb covers.  The opening track, It Won't Be Long, is fantastic and rousing.  This is a great album for anyone who loves fun music.
B0041T52S6|4.0|If you're a geek you will love this movie. it contains a lot of references gamers and computer techs will instantly recognize.    While I thought it was hilarious and a fun watch, my significant other pointed out quite a few of the flaws in the story. Normally this isn't a problem but I have to admit a few of them are pretty glaring and are hard to just sit back and ignore.
0312600844|1.0|I don't get the hype.  I heard such great things about this 'American Masterpiece' and it so did not live up to the expectations I had for it.  Characters that no one could possibly like...(not one person I cared about at all in this book!)... 100 pages (at least) about birds... pages and pages wasted on small talk between characters that does not advance the storyline whatsoever... pathetic female characters who are not realistic at all... Just overall a waste of time, and it took A LOT of time to read.  A very long boring book that left me mad at the end.  Every once in a while I could see why people say Franzen is a good writer - there are some great sentences, and great ideas every once in a while... but overall I have never been so bored reading a book.  If you like liberal politics, and birds, and really long side stories that never really go anywhere, you may enjoy this book.  Otherwise don't waste your time.
030746363X|5.0|This would be number uno as far as Amazon book review. I am consumed reading several titles at once, and without a doubt Tim delivered with this incredibly entertaining product.    I have been in the fitness business for over 11 years...since I was 18, and have tried many of these items Tim has so I relate well, and a ton Im sure he has done, but excluded. As far as Fitness books go it is much more fun than the majority, and poses frequent interesting points.    It huge, but reads fast. I would recommend to every walk of life. Nice Work Tim
0545123275|5.0|Shiver is somewhat Romeo and Juliet-esque with a preteranatural twist.  Its a case of love between a werewolf and a human, course these love matches always seem to be a bit difficult, if the one tries to stay secret and the other doesn't believe.  One unique point about this werewolf story that you don't see often is that these werewolves aren't only wolves during the full moon instead they are wolves when its cold outside for the season.  Another stand out feature is that one winter these werewolves' ability to change ceases causing them to stay wolves loosing their humanity.  As typical of most werewolf tales they try to keep their dual lives a secret from the rest of human society.  Sam, the werewolf wishes he could be normal, just plan human and not turn furry once the temperature drops.  For some reason Sam besides his interest in never loosing his humanity has gained an interest in Grace and he shares a bit of history with her...he saved her from the wolves. After surviving the attack the now older Grace seems normal besides for her fixation on all things wolf. Every winter Grace watches for a wolf with yellow eyes and this wolf watches for her.  Can these two overcome the boundaries that have been set and the secrets that may unravel it all? Is there a way for Sam to not ever loose his humanity which seems to be a possibility, will the wolf inside keep them apart?  Can the secrets of the werewolves stay safe if somebody gets hurt?        This is a well written, wonderful, riveting tale with words that flow right off the page.  Each line devoured keeps you hungry till the satisfying end.  Though of course at the end you will wonder what will happen next and this unique tale continues in Linger and I hear there is a new one coming out...I can't wait.  The characters are well developed and very believable if only werewolves exist...hmmm maybe they do, who's to say?  If you like werewolves and a good love story you may want to add this to your want to read pile.I look forward to reading more by this author.
B003JTHESA|2.0|A band of Maiden's stature and resources should only release material of the highest quality production. Brave New World had it. This album sounds flat- guitars and especially the Drums!! It ain't my system either. The snare is too loud and sounds like a cheap beginner's drum. Makes you wonder if the band listened to it before they released it. Even if there were worthy tracks ( there are only 2) it would not be enjoyable to listen to. A harsh, muddled production!
6305268843|5.0|I don't understand how Best Picture and Best Performance by an Actress were not awarded this film.  Sophie Marceau's is the best film performance of its decade.  She has an extremely difficult role and realizes every possibility in it.  The script owes a great deal to Charlotte Bronte, but is nonetheless original.  The director/writer has unified the story by putting the mother/daughter relationship at the center.  He builds this plot line to a truly great scene near the end of the film.  In early versions of the movie, there is a sequence where the Marceau character--named Elizabeth--dances with the male lead in a ballroom while upper-class snobs look on in disapproval.  In later cuts, this scene is wisely eliminated to throw more emphasis on the private dance that follows.  Stephen Dillane renders a sympathetic treatment of an introverted, brooding aristocrat.  Some of the character's harshness makes sense only within his moodiness.  Had Dillane not underscored this note in the character, he would have been too unsympathetic to deserve the love of Marceau's Elizabeth.  The movie is beautifully filmed, rightly giving much screen time to Marceau's amazing face and command of formal period movement.  She is graceful without becoming dancer-ish or stiff.  Her English is impeccable.  Had Marceau never done another movie, this one alone would establish her as a great actress.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|This is one of the better 3D videos we have purchased. The 3D graphics, really come out of the TV. Truly an enjoyable experience!
B003SWNRU2|5.0|Powerful come back for Accept. Blood of the nations is probably the best metal album in close to 20 years. The German metal masters are back to their best with an album that is just as good as (if not better than) \\"Breaker\\" and \\"Balls to the wall\\" from their hay days in the early 80's.<br />The new singer is brilliant and even the most hard core fans wont miss Udo Dirksneider. Songs are inspired diverse and filled with classic style riffs. This album forces you to crank up the volume and have a blast.<br />A must buy for metal fans. Again, best album in probably close to 20 years from anybody.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Searching for a truly unique, well-written, and gripping book? 'Room' will not disappoint.  I won't go into the details because the story is best if you just let it unfold as the author intended.  The characters stayed with me long after finishing the book, and the story is both incredibly sweet and disturbing at the same time.  The only drawback for me was that it was hard to get into another book for a while when I was done. My mind kept going back to the characters and emotion of this story. The voice of this little boy really got into my head, which made it an intense read, as well as a tough act to follow.  The less you know the better, but this is definitely a stand-out novel that is certain to draw you in and keep you riveted.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I didn't get this for myself, I bought for my girl friend as one of her christmas gifts this year. She's a huge doctor who fan and I thought this was an awesome item. I was a bit worried about some of the reviews that I read about it but In my opinion it looks great and my girlfriend loves it!

1423113381|3.0|My 10 year old asked me for this book as soon as it was on the market.  He LOVES the Percy Jackson series and was quite looking forward to this adventure.  I was excited as well, because I had never delved into a Riordan read.      I love to read aloud to by two boys (5 and 10).  Maybe I am too in love with the sound of my own voice, but my children seem to enjoy it, also.  This being said...this book did not offer a vast or expansive vocabulary and the points came across as short and choppy.  It was not a difficult read, but I became uninterested and distanced myself from the story almost from the beginning.  It has taken me way too long to get through this book and it is because I hear myself reading, but I am not attached to the story in any way.  I often have to stop and ask my boys if they are even grapsing the story, because I am not thouroughly engaged in the story.    I was also hoping that this story would offer a special relationship between the brother and sister.  The two characters are never fully developed and seem bland.  The bond between the siblings does not seem to grow stronger or impenetrable in the face of extreme, chaotic danger.  I have explained my feelings and views on this book to my 10 year old and he strongly disagrees.  He has interjected his enthusiastic appreciation for the writing several times in the story, \\"How can you not love that writing?!\\"  I did explain that everybody has a different point of view and everyone is definitely entitled to their own opinion.  On this book we must agree to diagree and still love that we are reading it together.      Thankfully, we should be finishing up tonight and I look forward to our next series...The Land of Elyon.  Happy reading!
1401223176|2.0|So I picked up this book the other day because I had heard it was pretty good, and being a fan of other Batman graphic novels, I figured I'd give it a spin.<br /><br />First the good....The artwork is AMAZING, Batman has never looked more menacing, Catwoman has never looked sexier, and the rogues gallery has never looked more insane! Jim Lee did an excellent job with fleshing out a lot of the iconic characters from the DC Universe. The colors are fantastic and vibrant as well.<br /><br />Now the not so good...The story isnt bad per se, but it is a bit convoluted and in many instances, seems to make weak excuses just to shove in another character from the DC Universe that doesn't really move the story along at all. Also, for all the hype surrounding him, Hush (the character) is probably the biggest disappointment in the Batman mythos since the horrible Batman and Robin movie.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything I just want to say that I guessed his identity about halfway through the book, but then thought to myself \\"that wouldn't make sense though\\". Well I guessed right, but it still doesn't really make sense. Also if you are looking for a book that actually drops clues as to Hushes identity throughout the story, this is NOT it. There is so much deception and misinformation and NONE of it actually gives you any chance of deducing Hushes identity. By the time you are told who he is (in one scene the beans are spilled in a rather ungraceful manner) the mystery being revealed doesn't leave that sense of \\"holy CRAP! I should have known!\\" like Kaiser Soze in The Usual Suspects, but leaves you thinking \\"um...what?\\"<br /><br />oh....and Super dog is in this book, which is almost a deal breaker for me in the first place.<br /><br />I would recommend reading Batman Year One or The Killing Joke....both of those are more focused and have more depth to them then this book....they might not have the large cast of characters or action scenes of Hush, but they are infinitely more satisfying to read in my opinion.
030746363X|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about the book, but bought it anyway for the low price.    Little did I know about Tim, the book is easy to get into and extremely hard to put down. I'm now 4/5 through the book and even though Tim objects it I've been reading the book from start to finish - it's too interesting not to! The bite size projects approach is a great format for reading and user friendly doses make it very easy to digest and get great ideas for self exploration.    I've gotten more tips and ideas from his book for nutrition and training than from several other programs I've encountered before. The instructions are clear, enough science to validate and get excited, the principle of \\"Minimum Effective Dose\\" - tiniest changes producing the biggest results makes all the experiments even more interesting. The changes might be tiny, but it doesn't mean they are easy. Many of the experiments are not for everyman, but everybody will find several life altering insights that will truly change their life for good. Tim provides easy and handy shorthand links to a lot of online resources throughout the book.    I seriously recommend this book more than anything else for anybody who is interested in losing weight, gaining strength or muscle, running better, longer and faster - and then there is of course the sex improvements. I haven't gotten yet to take on those, but they do make a no fuss but interesting read by themselves.    I already started losing fat on his Slow-Carb diet and found my three new favorite exercises that helped getting the worked out feeling back to my workouts - Two Arm Kettle Bell Swing, Cat Vomit and Myotatic Crunch - these workouts are the new baseline of a shorter and way more effective workout. Can't wait to incorporate some of the more interesting superhuman programs into my training.    If you are serious about a physical change there is no more accessible, comprehensive and life changing read than this  - and it's a steal!
0452289963|5.0|I love this book, I read it every night before sleep. It makes me calm by reminding that little problems during the day are not important. And,that my life is in my hands, so relax and go to sleep peacefully.I bought about 8 copies of this book, five of them in Russian, and gave to my friends. So they could find the roots of their problems.  Great book and great author.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I loved this book! It reminds me of older thrillers. Yes, there is a sex, and horrid at that, but it flows with the story. I don't feel that it's over the top or unnecessary. I really became attached to the characters and it became a very fast read. I couldn't wait to finish the trilogy.
1559408898|5.0|despite the iffyness of robocop 4 at beyondhollywood, sometime in 2011 mgm WILL  remake robocop as completely unrelated to the paul verheoven original, which is still my all time favorite gonzo-styled action/adventure film of the late 1980's. no other film before(or after)it can even compare to it, be it the r-rated or x-rated original.    this will be a complete re-boot of the series(or a rip-off?) orion did it right the first time around!    aside from the prime directives films,the tv series, and the cartoon, which i love, i am going to remain neutral until it's release. lets see if mgm can compare to or beat paul verhoeven's outragious classic! esp. box o$$ice!
B004132I4S|5.0|Sufjan has returned from some sort of cosmic delirium (vast experimentation with electronic soundscapes, researching Royal Robertson's artwork and life, and battling illness) and has brought an amazing development.      First, I'll start off with what Sufjan fans will find familiar:  the sweeping arppegiated phrases on the woodwinds, Sufjan's great lyricism and vocal licks, and great narrative in each song.  When I first heard Age of Adz, I thought of \\"Star of Wonder\\".  The title track feels very similar.    What's new:  Though he's delved into it before, the electronic palette here sounds very warm.  Sounds paradoxical but the production on this album feels analogue especially when the electronics are alongside acoustic instruments like the woodwinds.  Overall, I'd say the palette feels somewhere from the world of IDM and glitch but it's tastefully used imo.  Not much acoustic guitar or banjo to be found here      As mentioned before, the lyrics do form an overarching concept that feels biblical at times.  This makes sense given the thematic elements on this album such as aspects of Royal Robertson's work (his artwork is on the cover and in the booklet btw).  However, there are surely numerous separate, influential themes at play but that one is the most apparent.  The theme of the album is really the major difference I think from past albums.  Some might call it less personal than his passed albums but it's my opinion that this album is more personal than his others.  It's a demonstration of Sufjan working through a creative crisis of sorts and it really comes across as an exposed, vulnerable work demonstrating his struggle.      All the tracks are really amazing and I didn't feel there was any filler here.  \\"Impossible Soul\\" is really amazing in particular.  The title track got me hooked, \\"I Want To Be Well\\" could be his edgiest song yet, and \\"Too Much\\" is a great pop-ish hit in 7/8.      I'm not sure if anyone could've seen Age of Adz coming, but given his workwith The BQE and folk record, I suppose it's possible.  It's really amazing to see a great artist plunge into something new and unfamiliar and I can't wait to see what's next.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Robert Plant continues to put out great music.  This new release is great.  A few of the tracks are lacking, but purchase the whole CD for the rest of the songs.  You can tell that there is some inspiration from his earlier collaboration with Alison Krause.  The music is mellow and folksy - well worth the wait.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|Ok this is the album that is suppose to make her the Queen of Hip Hop? ...... :crickets: RIGHT! Leave Hip Hop to the vets. It's funny how she doesn't want to acknowledge Lil Kim but she can't keep away from the subliminals. & above all that, the album is trash. She NEEDED to beef with Lil Kim to drown the fact that this is a Chek drink coaster. Sorry Minaj, your Katy Perry lyrics are no longer lyrics. I'd like the album if it had Fergie's name on it, sounds like her.  Lil Kim's debut= Classic   Pink Friday= :crickets:
B00192IV9U|4.0|I can't believe this got bad reviews. I thought this was a good album. I was alittle worried when listening to Breaking News. It sounded like a throw away from Dangerous. After listening to the whole album, I loved what I heard. How can you not love How My Hand?  That's a great single. Hollywood Tonight and Monster were also great songs! I was really impressed by the updated sound of Michael Jackson. He really put in some great work! I'm really surprised that Neyo and Will I am thought this album wasn't ready for the public,this is a great buy!

B002ZG981E|4.0|This is probably not the first review you have read about Inception. And frankly if you are reading this review you should probably go ahead and buy the movie because if you are interested enough to get this far then you might as well take the leap.<br /><br />As for my review: I really enjoyed this movie. My take on this movie is that it is the movie equivalent of a \\"Lost\\" episode. Not that the settings are similar but that the themes (what is reality, freedom, craziness) are all there. This movie cannot be watched without there being a down time afterward in which you must forgo all mental intake and actually think through what you just watched.<br /><br />Entertaining, well acted, well directed, engaging. I'm not sure what else you would want in a movie. Unless you want realistic. The possibilities of the type of activities that take place are remote even for future generations, IMO, but still you do not go to the movies for a science lesson. You go to escape, think, be moved, be engaged.<br /><br />This movie definitely does that.

0316042994|2.0|The story has been summarized before: from an army camp, Charles Ryder reminisces about his youthful passion for a young aristocrat, Lord Flyte, and his subsequent passion for Lord's Flyte's sister, who has much in her of the young man - meaning she looks a lot like him.<br />Let me dispel a few misconceptions. First, that this is a masterpiece of style:<br />it ain't. the style is pedestrian, efficient in a workaday manner. There are no arresting phrases, no memorable scenes. When the emotional temper of the story rises, the author piles on a lot of qualifiers, but it all seems rather contrived, as if he was trying to get himself pumped up.<br />Second: that it is a brilliant portrayal of a declining aristocracy: yes, there is some of that. It is done, however, in passing, with rushed asides. There is no sustained exploration. In fact, the novel is laughably thin on framing a sense of the age in which it lives. Contemporary references are done by piling on lines of dialogue, mainly lines from Rex's oafish friends. That is cheap theatrical technique, done by someone who is merely trying to imply profundities, and not go into the trouble of actually writing them.<br />Third: that it is a deep exploration of religious faith, or the loss thereof. Phew. I have a question for those who say that: have you read Dostoevsky or even Graham Greene? Read Greene if you want a much deeper understanding of Catholicism in our world. The brief remarks on religion in this book are laughably simplistic: again, allusions, hints at a greater meaning, paths sketched but not followed through. What is the meaning of Julia's hysterical crisis? Can you read that and wonder where it came from?<br />About Sebastian. Of course he was gay. Why was he caring for the German? Just out of friendship? We don't know if Ryder was, but the narrator calls Sebastian the forerunner of his love for Julia. What does that mean?<br />As a novel, this is rather boring. Nothing much happens. There are a lot of re-tellings of events. Narration consists of a number of dialogues. It seems to be mainly about upper class and upper middle class young men who wanted to have sex with each other, but didn't. Classic.Narration consists of a number of dialogues.

B000002B7O|5.0|As many others have written here, this is the remastered original recording.  It is not the 2002 \\"remix\\" that is missing the original bass and drum tracks from Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake.  There is no substitute for the real thing.    I own the original versions of Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman on CD.  The original CD for Blizzard of Ozz is severely lacking in depth and clarity.  Overall, it sounds washed out, especially the bass.  The original CD for Diary of a Madman is quite a bit better, just not great.  The best way to describe its sound is harsh, bordering on distorted.  Both of the 1995 remasters, Diary of a Madman for this commentary, are worth buying even if you already own the originals.  The sound of the remasters is smooth and clear with better depth, especially in terms of bringing out individual bass and drum notes.  It's nothing miraculous by any stretch, since the original recordings are less than ideal, but it's well worth the money for anyone who loves the originals and wishes they sounded better.
1400079276|4.0|I am a huge fan of Mura-kami which explains why I am generally disappointed with this piece. What started as initially challenging, original, inspired and complex turned sour the minute Naka-ta passed away and disintegrated into a banal farce and what is probably best described as a Sunday reader.<br /><br />To understand Mura-kami is to understand that he has three distinct levels of writing; sublime, so-so and 'please put the pen down and find a new profession'. Mura-kami has within him absolute sublime greatness: Norwegian Wood, Hardboiled, Dance-Dance, South of the Border; abject averageness -Sputnik, Underground, and what one can only assume amounts to publishing or contractual obligations - Birthday Stories (ed.) and After Dark. This work represents Mura-kami in his 'so-so' mode.<br /><br />Whilst this work started out as a thoroughbred it soon became clear it was no more than a 'noma-uma' (a miniature Shi-koku pony). Mura-kami Haruki (rather like artist Mura-kami Takashi) is all too often held up and praised in a way that is reminiscent of the whole adoration of the Oriental by the Occidental, and thus he is often cut way too much slack and given far too much freedom to manoeuver, when his counterparts would be herded and slaughtered. He is rather treaded with kid-gloves as some romantic projection of the West's eternal and unyielding fascination with all things Japanese and what ensues therefore is mediocrity and banality passed off as Post-modernism and surrealism. For my money, bad is bad. Poor plots will remain forever so, despite any supposed references or allusion to ontological or philosophical leanings and the ever-present musical musings.<br /><br />Mura-kami's genius though does shine through in the first half of the book, and when it shines one is reminded of his greatness and the need to wear sunglasses in his presence. But as the sun faded mid-way through and the magic was gone, then the fact of loss is all the sadder, and all the more painful to bear.

0439023521|5.0|The book is very engaging, a great nail-biter and undoubtedly a page-turner. I found myself cheering for our heroine, empathizing with her and eagerly turning the Kindle pages to see what comes next. Although there is the occasional run-on sentence and some strange punctuation here and there, the book is a very easy read overall.     However, as fun and satisfying as it was to read the book, I will not be reading the sequels. In my personal opinion (pardon the tautology) this should should have been a one-book plot. There is not enough enticement to continue -- I don't really care *that* much what choice Katniss makes for her love life, nor is there any open-ended, unfinished segue to any other tangent that leaves me wanting more. In fact, I think the way the book ended could possibly have been the best way to finish a one-book story anyway.    A great, fun, exciting read that is sure to please (and there are two sequels if you're looking for more).

B003PGNBO8|5.0|Yes, it was trying too hard to be like \\"Lost\\" and the flashbacks were very irritating at first, but by the second or third episode, I was hooked. The more I watched it, the better I liked it. And yes, I understand that they wanted it to become a series that dragged on for years, but aren't we all pretty tired of those? Don't most of them just replay the same formula over so often that you want to bash in the TV screen? Wouldn't it be great if there were more series that began and ended, intentionally, in one series? That might take more creativity, and it would cost more, because they couldn't reuse sets and such for years, but I'd really like that. What about you?

B001152TL6|5.0|After many years of watching David Lynch's films, I've finally stopped trying to figure them out. It's not that I don't have theories about his movies, it's just that I get more enjoyment out of simply watching them, and accepting Lynch's ghastly universe in all of its dreadful glory. LOST HIGHWAY is the finest example of neo-psycho-noir I've ever seen. I like it as much as (perhaps a bit more than) MULHOLLAND DRIVE and BLUE VELVET. The characters are perfectly dark and mysterious, the setting is bleak and convoluted, and the atmosphere is suffocatingly ominous. Lynch's use of violence and sensuality, stirred into his black stew of \\"the unknown\\" make for a wonderful, creepy experience! I never tire of his stories because they are each a unique puzzle-box to play around with. HIGHWAY is another milestone in Lynch's career...
0380713802|4.0|This is the second book by Bill Bryson that I have read, but since the first was [[ASIN:0061673692 Shakespeare: The World as Stage]], this was the first time I got to experience Bryson's humor and travel writing. I was hardly disappointed. In \\"Travels in Europe\\" Bryson writes about the cross-continent trek that he took alone in 1990 and he weaves memories of a trip that he made in the 1970s with a friend across Europe. Bryson travels from Hammerfest in northern Norway to Paris, Belgium, and the Netherlands, to Germany, Denmark, and Sweden, to Italy, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, and Austria, to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and finally Istanbul. Bryson can be both hilarious and serious at times (for example his sobering discussion of Switzerland), although he is mostly hilarious. There is at least one sentence on each page that will make you grin, and there is about one sentence in every ten pages that will make you laugh out loud.<br /><br />A sampler: while at a restaurant in the German city of Aachen, Bryson attempts to order a beer,<br /><br />My waitress spoke no English, and I had the most extraordinary difficulty getting myself understood. I asked for a beer and she looked at me askance. \\"Wass? Tier?\\"<br />\\"Nein, beer,\\" I said, and her puzzlement grew.<br />\\"Fear? Steer? Queer? King Leer?\\"<br />\\"Nein, nein, beer.\\" I pointed at the menu.<br />\\"Ah, beer,\\" she said, with a private \\"tut,\\" as if I had been intentionally misleading her.<br /><br />Although it is clear that Bryson took some artistic license in creating this dialogue, this comical passage highlights the difficulty that Bryson encounters throughout his travels in only knowing one language. And at times I wished that Bryson was multilingual, as Bryson would have been able to probe the various countries and cultures that he experienced. Rather, it seems that Bryson is stuck with the normal tourist sites and relegated to eating alone in expensive restaurants; but Bryson is a great writer so his wit and prose make up for this inconvenience.<br /><br />Once he gets to Yugoslavia Bryson notices that he has become homesick, and I must admit that I too was getting a little worn out of his increasingly monotonous travels, and I was glad when he wrapped things up in Istanbul. But all-in-all this was a fun book to read.gets to Yugoslavia Bryson notices that he has become homesick, and I must admit that I too was getting a little worn out of his increasingly monotonous travels, and I was glad when he wrapped things up in Istanbul.

B000024D4R|5.0|in brief: Pink Floyd's masterpiece.  in keeping with the general trend of the very best of the arts being relegated to the least read, least listened to, and least gazed at; in keeping also with the best of Pink Floyed remaining the least listened to (how often do we hear \\"Time\\" on the radio followed by the album track it segues into on the album itself, \\"The Great Gig in the Sky,\\" featuring the amazing operatic vocals of Claire Trevor? likewise, how often are we given all seven parts of \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\"? never), \\"Animals\\" is without doubt the most fluid and auricularly amazing of Pink Floyd's post-\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" work. as long as i'm spouting, let me toss this question out -- am i alone in think \\"The Wall\\" a somewhat tedious, inbred, and overlong piece of self-indulgence? the two discs of \\"The Wall\\" may have made a fantastic single disc if only there had been a bit more creativity and self-critiquing and a bit less chest-pounding.

B003B02O14|4.0|I struggled with a rating for a while.  3 stars didn't seem fair, 4 felt too generous.  Since there are no \\"half\\" ratings, I rounded up and called this a 4.<br /><br />The story contains all of Grisham's writing strengths - the slow reveal of the conspiracy, the \\"chase,\\" the legal actions, drama, and moments to laugh out loud as the legal system shuts down the wrong-doers who think they are in the clear.  However, the reveal is dragged out when Patrick & Eva refuse to give their lawyer all the information at once, causing him to run without all the information.  This gave me the feeling that the dragging-out process was done for no other reason than to increase the page count.  I've never \\"felt\\" the emotions of the characters in Grisham's books before, and this one is no different.  I didn't \\"feel\\" Patrick's pain in the torture, I never \\"felt\\" Eva's love for Patrick.  There is also the matter of a large inconstency between the actions of some characters throughout the book, and their actions in the final pages.<br /><br />If Grisham made me believe in the characters more, and if I didn't get the impression he was trying to stretch a page-count, I would feel more confident in giving this 4 stars.<br /><br />However, that didn't prevent me from enjoying the book. I did find this to be a pretty decent page-turner nonetheless.
0385528752|4.0|Switch is a book Josef Goebbels, Adolf Hitler's Minister of Propaganda, would rate with five stars.  Goebbels's Principles of Propaganda, just like the Switch change framework (Direct the Rider, Motivate the Elephant, and Shape the Path) excises Values and Goal Setting from Change.  What remains is a set of tactics Switch identifies to realize change no matter what goals and values the leaders want to achieve and realize.  Although the change framework in Switch potentially provides powerful tactics for change, Switch has some major and fatal deficiencies.<br /><br />The framework with its tactics for change described in SWITCH - HOW TO CHANGE THINGS WHEN CHANGE IS HARD by Chip Heath and Dan Heath published by Broadway Books, New York 2010 has some major and fatal deficiencies.  (I will use the term \\"change framework\\" as a convenient way to refer to the Switch framework and tactics for change described in this book.)<br /><br />The change framework<br />* Is amoral and value neutral,<br />* Is dangerous and provides a potentially powerful means for propaganda,<br />* Discounts reason and is inconsistent with its formulation,<br />* Can be used to establish and sustain totalitarianism, potentially resulting in holocausts,<br />* Is missing the ethical compass, the Superego from Freud's standpoint, and<br />* Is inimical to democracy and potentially supportive of totalitarianism<br /><br />It is recommended that the authors augment the book by providing a methodology for how members in a group can democratically formulate and support worthy goals to satisfy the critical and important needs of the group in a manner consistent with the group's prevailing pluralistic values.<br /><br />The change framework is amoral and value neutral.  There is no discussion in Switch about what makes a goal desirable (e.g., using methods of Immanuel Kant, utilitarianism, or Sir William Walter Ross) and worthy of attainment in the context of the ethical values.  There is no discussion on how to identify goals that are worthy of attainment in the context of these ethical values and real needs.  In the wrong hands, it could be used as an effective recipe for despotism.  The goals are critically important.<br /><br />The change framework is dangerous and provides a potentially powerful means for propaganda.  The framework may be extremely dangerous if effective. It is like giving a loaded gun with instructions on how to effectively use it without providing the user advice on the ethical use of the gun, e.g., under what (very restricted) conditions (e.g., target practice and self-defense), it is ethically permissible to use it.<br /><br />Without the moral compass, Switch provides a simple framework for propaganda, which consists of tactics aimed at influencing or manipulating attitudes and behaviors of an individual or a community to help realize one or more goals.  Many of the tactics identified in Switch are similar to those proposed by Goebbels and other advocates of propaganda.  See [...]The change framework discounts reason and is inconsistent with its formulation.  The framework explicitly discounts reason. The framework explicitly discounts reason by asserting that the Rider will think in \\"True But Useless\\" (TBU) circles if not given direction.  It claims that the Rider will not be able to set the direction if the Elephant opposes the rider`s direction.  But isn't the change framework itself a rational mechanism that the Rider can use to nudge or coax the Elephant to move in the direction that Rider chooses?  Even though the framework explicitly discounts reason, it provides the Rider (the intellect) the means by which to influence the elephant.  Therefore, the change framework enables the intellect and reason to greatly influence if not control the emotions of the Elephant.<br /><br />If the intellect and reason are really as Switch portrays, how did the change framework become articulated, presented, and communicated?  The Rider as describedin the Switch could not have formulated the change framework.  It would simply think in circles (TBU).  In Switch, the Leader when equipped with the framework and tactics for change is the agent of change.<br /><br />The framework and tactics for change must have been created by a series of clever Riders, don't you think?  The Elephant didn't create the change framework.  Overtime, the authors of propaganda and change literature, including the books referenced in \\"Recommendations for Additional Reading,\\" accumulated knowledge that the Switch authors synthesized into this very powerful change framework.  The Rider is not the weak analyzer Switch would have you believe.  Riders created the change framework that enable the Rider some level of mastery over the Elephant.  Reason created the change framework.  Therefore, reason and the Rider are of paramount importance.<br /><br />The change framework can used to establish and sustain totalitarianism, potentially resulting in holocausts.  Switch pays little attention to the Leaders.  But how does the Leader relate to the framework and the tactics for change?  Who are the Leaders and what is their relationship to the Riders and Elephants?  In the case of an individual, it is your reason equipped with the change framework.  Generally, a Leader is a person (Rider/Elephant) who is expert in the change framework and who is in a leadership position of responsibility for a group of people or community to help the group or community satisfy some of its most important needs by applying the framework and tactics for change in a manner as consistent as possible with the prevailing and pluralistic ethical values of the members of the group or community.  There should be much more discussion about Leaders and how they relate to the change framework.  The last century should have taught us that unbridled reason (The Rider with propaganda) threatens to erupt in holocaust without an ethical compass.<br /><br />The change framework is missing the ethical compass, the Superego from Freud's standpoint.<br />Freud (Beyond the Pleasure Principle 1920 and The Ego and the Id 1923) would have called the ethical compass, which is totally missing in the Switch, the Superego.  He would have called the Elephant the Id and the Rider the Ego.  The rational Ego attempts to resolve or at least mitigate the conflict between the Id (Elephant) and the Superego (the ethical compass).  The change framework is a good means to help mitigate if not resolve this conflict.<br /><br />Because there is no understanding of the connection between these tactics and worthy goals in the context of ethical values, Switch misses the opportunity to provide direction (to the Ego) on how identify the specific tactics for change that would be effective given the nature of the goals that ought be realized in the context of the ethical compass (Superego).  The framework provides no methodology for the selection of specific tactics given worthy goals in the context of evolved ethical values.<br /><br />The change framework is inimical to democracy and potentially supportive of totalitarianism.  For a description of totalitarianism see [...].  How does the Switch framework with its leaders relate to a democratic society?  The Switch encourages the Leaders to separate themselves from the other members of the group.  The Leaders somehow determine the goals (the framework provides no guidance) and use the framework with its tactics for change to manipulate the other members of the group to realize the goals.  There is no discussion of how the leaders formulate worthy goals that are consistent the leaders' group ethical values and genuine needs.  This framework and its tactics for change can very easily be used to establish and sustain totalitarianism.  The fatal flaw of the framework is the absence of an ethical component.<br /><br />Some recommendations follow.  The authors should augment the framework with an ethical compass.

His performance in 'Breaking Bad' rises to a new level.<br /><br />The writing on this series is exceptional, but I can't turn away from this character.  Walter White is like a great hitter in his prime, when he's at the plate you aren't going into the kitchen.<br /><br />Cranston TRULY makes the actors around him better.  As the series progresses, EVERYONE improves.  That, in itself, makes this series worth watching.<br /><br />The subject is serious and the story is dark.

B003E8P9G0|1.0|For those of you who are Rick Riordan fans like me. I strongly advise you to skip this book! The book Red Pyramid is about the kane siblings Sadie and Carter who are put into battle against the Egyptian gods when their father is locked in a sarcophagus after  messing with the Rosetta Stone. The story is nothing like The beloved Percy Jackson series and quite disappointing.    This book is very different from what you can usually find in Riordan's books. The book  goes back  and forth between Carter and Sadie's thoughts. Way to many characters appear and disappear in the book making it extremely hard to follow. The characters chosen were extremely boring and very  weird.   From some warrior women to a cat women named beta, you are likely to find yourself getting brain cramps while reading.     I also found a lot of the information in the book pointless, the author went on with simple things for way to long. It was hard too not skip pages just so I could read about something new. You probably spent over 30 minutes reading about the explanation of what one of the characters is doing.     I have to admit that after finishing the book I was cringing at the fact new books had come out. I couldn't pick one up for weeks. I didn't want to waste time reading another 500 page book with no ending to it. But after some persuading from my cousin who is also a very big Riordan fan, I am going to read The Lost Hero.I am waiting for it to come into my library.  I just hope it will pick up my spirits after the authors big crash with this book. Once again I am a huge fan of the author and hope to cause no harm to any of the readers who enjoyed the book. But in my opinion this book could have been a lot better!

One scene summed it up  Russian president is shot dead in Newyork - the suspect is put in a NYPD car, no FBI or SS.  US president is telling his security guys - if the russians did this I am going to use nuclear force, wow, do you want to talk about it with the Chief of Staffe?  If you want to see Angelina Jolie bash up the same 2 man patrols at different places because they never figure out she is a super woman or always seem so dumb go for it...
B003VB5E2E|4.0|The Bluray video and audio quality are quite good for  a live outdoor event. It seemed more like an indoor event.  There wasn't much background noise.  Some songs were a bit streched out and since it is a guitar festival, there isn't a lot of different instrumentation.

B0043A0PXU|5.0|I thought it was excellent, the minute I first played the songs. Annie's voice has matured over the past decade, and her voice may seem harder in these recordings, but her pronounciation in both english and french is impeccable. There isn't a song I don't enjoy on A Christmas Cornucopia.<br />And I'm happy this isn't the typical commercial \\"Jingle Bells\\" type of Christmas album too. The songs are cleverly arranged and sung.<br />Oh what a joy it is, to listen to Annie attack each carol in her own flawless form. I love listening to the album on my ipod on the way to school.<br />I now own the CD and am disappointed in the fact that there aren't any photos of Annie inside the booklet of the standard, jewel-case edition.<br />I'm happy to have the CD in my hands, though. I ordered it online because I didn't see it anywhere in stores during the holiday season. That is strange!<br />I figured, since it's an Annie Lennox release, it would've been more \\"Available\\" in all our local music stores. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it anywhere!<br />Honestly, it's true, and I don't know why they would make this CD so hard to get during the holiday season.<br /><br />It started out with my downloading the entire album from itunes, which was nice because I had the music during the holiday season while I traveled to school.<br />Although there aren't any non-favorites on the CD, my \\"standout\\" tracks are \\"The Holly And The Ivy\\", \\"Il Est Ne Le Divin Enfant\\" and \\"Universal Child\\". The first two mentioned tracks are timeless classics, which are perfectly suited for Annie's voice. As far as Annie's voice is concerned, I've always thought her voice was clear as a bell. Without a doubt, next Christmas, \\"A Christmas Cornucopia\\" CD will definitely be in my SONY stereo on a regular basis. On a lower ote, I read (on and off of amazon) where people have stated that Annie's voice is/was too rough and not adequate for singing Christmas carols & other holiday-related material.<br />Well...I beg to differ, for I enjoy Annie's strong, clear voice, which is perfectly fit for singing anything. I've followed Annie Lennox since the late 70's when I got hold of their first LP \\"In The Garden\\". As Annie has stated in the booklet, she has wanted to record this album for quite some time. You go girl!!!<br /><br />Universal Child is a wonderful closing piece, and I wish it would become a commercial single, released and sold on CD in stores and not only on ebay.<br />I will say it again...I wish there was at least one new photo of Annie in the booklet, ever since I saw some beautiful photos of her in the listing of this CD on amazon. It actually prompted me into expecting to see these same photos inside the booklet. What there is (inside the booklet) is a very descriptive song-by-song critique, in Annie's own words, regarding her own perception of each song. This is nice and I appreciate reading what Annie has to say.<br /><br />The CD is blue with silver accents & titling, housed in a standard clear jewel-case with fully-credited booklet, full of liner notes and notes from Annie, talking about each song. Both new and diehard Annie Lennox fans should own \\"A Christmas Cornucopia\\", and you absolutely/definitely do NOT have to be Christian or celebrate Christmas to enjoy this collection of heart-felt, inspiring and well-arranged holiday music +.

B003DZX3US|5.0|This movie is a classic.  I am so glad that I was able to purchase it for my children to watch.  The movie arrived very quickly and in great condition.
B003L20IJM|4.0|It's great to see Nanny McPhee back, although quite why the UK title (Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang) was jettisoned for the pedestrian 'Nanny McPhee Returns', I'm not sure. However, the lady who talks softly but carries a big stick is as magical as ever.    Moving the setting forward to World War Two creates a different ambience for the action, with a purple Rolls-Royce, a supercharged motorbike and an enemy bomber all contributing to the story. There are more computer graphics with this film, but they are so expertly done that it's often hard to see where reality ends and studio wizardry takes over. Do watch the excellent bonus features for some insights into how the special effects were produced.    The acting is excellent, including Maggie Gyllenhaal as the harassed mother, Rhys Ifans as the villainous Uncle Phil, Ralph Fiennes in a cameo as Cyril and Celia's father and the inimitable Maggie Smith as the eccentric shopkeeper who has a little secret of her own. The children are also uniformly wonderful and the whole thing is held together by Emma Thompson as the lady with the lumps (with the assistance of Mr. Edelweiss).    I've rated this movie as one star less than the first NM, mainly because there isn't the same sense of antagonism between the children and Nanny McPhee as there was in the first film. Their 'not wanting her', part of the reason for her being there, doesn't manifest itself very much and soon they are routinely calling on her for help. They also seem to be doing pretty well at learning her lessons on their own; at one point, she even remarks that things shouldn't be too easy and promptly gives them an entirely fresh, and magical, challenge. This lack of tension somewhat changes the dynamics of the movie and it becomes more the children and Nanny McPhee against the bad guys than Nanny McPhee teaching the children lessons about life.    However, this isn't a movie which needs deep philosophical thought. It's a jolly romp which leaves the viewer feeling happy, and wanting more Nanny McPhee.
1439152780|4.0|There is a castle in THE DISTANT HOURS, and a moat, not to mention a deep forest; there is a trio of slightly batty, secretive sisters; there is a likable protagonist --- an editor, passionate about reading --- who goes sleuthing where she shouldn't; and there is one particularly crucial dark and stormy night. There is romance, too, but most of the love affairs lie in the past and are forbidden and/or thwarted.    Like tea and toast in the morning, the elements of a satisfying gothic novel are reliably present in every one of Kate Morton's books (I've read all three), making them the sort of reading material you count on to see you through a country weekend, a bout of insomnia, or an overnight flight. Call it Comfort Fiction.    I heaved a contented sigh when this novel began with an intriguing, slightly bone-chilling excerpt from the mysterious fairy tale that is a key factor in the plot. I adore children's fantasies, so I identified immediately with the narrator's love of books. I am mad for England, especially the World War II era, so I was thrilled that this novel jumps back and forth between the late 1930s and early 1940s, and 1992. And I have always wanted to live (or at least read and write) in a turret.    The story is complicated, but here is the short(ish) version. Edith (Edie) Burchill, a young Londoner, discovers that her mother was one of the children sent to the countryside for protective purposes during the Blitz --- specifically, she landed at Milderhurst Castle in Kent. Shortly thereafter, Edie finds herself in the neighborhood of the castle and realizes that its late owner, Raymond Blythe, wrote her favorite childhood book, a classic called The True History of the Mud Man (Morton's invention but entirely credible, it's about a fearsome Black Lagoon-type creature emerging from the moat and clambering up the tower where a young girl dreams and waits). She visits Milderhurst and its current residents, Raymond Blythe's daughters: gruff, chain-smoking Persephone (Percy); her pretty, timid twin, Seraphina (Saffy); and Juniper, their sister by Raymond's second marriage, an inspired writer and fragile soul who has episodes of violence and memory loss.    The Blythes have a very chequered past. Raymond's mother (fell from tower) and first wife (burned alive) expire under suspicious and dramatic circumstances; in his later years, he becomes paranoid and uncharacteristically religious, and he, too, falls to his death. Percy, Saffy and Juniper have all loved and lost, though Morton is canny about not revealing the precise details of their respective tragedies until the end of the book. As Edie pursues these mysteries (ostensibly to research the introduction to a new edition of The True History of the Mud Man), she finds that her mother, Meredith, who became Juniper's confidante during her stay at the castle, is herself mixed up in the family's intimate history.    Indeed, I found the relationship between Edie and her mother the most compelling feature of THE DISTANT HOURS. In her youth, Meredith has literary inclinations, and at Milderhurst she is encouraged in this by the Blythes --- until her rather unimaginative parents haul her back to London. She grows up to become a conventional wife and mother, but now, as her daughter delves into the past, we see Meredith morph back into the creative spirit she once was (though not without a great deal of initial resistance). Morton handles this transformation with delicacy and compassion. Even Edie's stolid father becomes engaged in the hunt for the truth behind Blythe's celebrated book. Who is the Mud Man, and what does it all mean?    I don't want to say too much more, because the success of Morton's work depends on a series of carefully timed revelations. However, they struck me as somewhat anticlimactic simply because there are so many of them. In striving to show how family secrets, conflicts and patterns resonate over the generations, Morton makes her story denser and morerepetitive than necessary. Although Edie is the principal voice, each of the sisters, their father and Edie's mother also narrate episodes from 40 years back, and soon we are awash in jilted women, ardent writers and guilty memories. It feels like overkill to me.    The good thing about Morton's work is that she evokes the finest prose traditions and thereby elevates what could have been a jejune romance into something more substantial. She summons the reader's intensely emotional relationship to books like JANE EYRE and REBECCA (madwomen or -men in attics, great houses going up in flames, and so forth); and her plot devices, frequently more convenient than believable, recall Dickens. But this is a two-edged sword. Although Morton's writing has flashes, indeed whole passages, of brilliance, it isn't on the same level as the masters upon whom she patterns herself. At times she lapses into howlers (\\"greedy greenery\\"; \\"his heart splurting\\") that I wish a keen-eyed editor had caught.    I know that Morton is capable of more than well-crafted diversions. She has the talent (and perhaps needs the courage) to write a less predictable, less derivative book. I'm thinking of novels that draw on the gothic tradition but also transcend it, such as Sarah Waters's THE LITTLE STRANGER or Jean Rhys's stunning JANE EYRE prequel, WIDE SARGASSO SEA. Like all literary \\"children,\\" Morton wants to carry on the heritage of the great storytellers of the past. But perhaps it is time to take that legacy into fresh territory. Now that would really be a treat.        --- Reviewed by Kathy Weissman
B000F1IQNM|5.0|This is a very well-made and well-written movie which will appeal to kids from, as the Christmas song says, 1 to 92. Nanny McPhee is a stern and ugly person, who nevertheless has something magical about her. As she goes about transforming the little savages she cares for, their metamorphosis is mirrored in Nanny McPhee herself. Somehow along the way she manages to enhance the lives of the cook, the maid, the elderly harridan of a Great-Aunt and, of course, the children's widowed father.    Emma Thompson wrote the script and plays Nanny McPhee and manages to be convincing in the most unlikely circumstances. Colin Firth is the hapless father and the excellent cast includes such stalwart British actors as Imelda Staunton, Derek Jacobi and Celia Imrie. Angela Lansbury as the Great-Aunt is marvelously irascible, not to say completely dotty. The children are wonderful and produce amazing performances which keep the plot bubbling along. It's a very funny movie, with some sadness to balance the comedy, and a suitable ending.    This isn't Mary Poppins, nor is it intended to be. Nanny McPhee has her own place in the genre and a very special place it is. I believe we need her, but I can't say I don't want her. Hopefully that's enough to keep her coming back.
1439177783|5.0|After reading UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS, I feel quite certain that its author would fully understand why I am beginning my response to her book by telling a story of my own; it's a way of affirming just how successful she has been in writing about something still too hidden, too \\"unmentionable\\" in so-called polite company.    I remember the \\"apple fight\\" as if it were just yesterday, but what turned out to be a startling teaching moment actually happened more than 40 years ago in my freshman university year. It's how I first learned about people like Portia de Rossi and gained some insight into the horrible affliction of eating disorders.    Living on campus that year, my first-term roommate was one of those girls who you know has a completely different life, one you are simply not part of in any way. She was inscrutable, elusive and taciturn, spending most of her time in class, in the library, or (I assumed) with her own friends. Nearly every evening I had the luxury of undisturbed study time until curfew.    As late fall mid-terms and essay deadlines approached, I spent less time socializing in the dining hall after dinner and instead would take one or two crisp, crunchy apples back to the dorm to eat while studying. But one rainy evening, my barely-there roommate came back early; suddenly there she was, standing damp, rigid and livid in the doorway, glaring at a very surprised me, \\"caught in the act\\" with book and apple in hand.    \\"Eating, eating, eating, that's all you ever do!\\" she blurted out. \\"What's wrong with you anyway? You're just trying to get to me, aren't you? Well you can't!! No way will I make a pig of myself...\\"    After that irrational outburst, she stormed off to the lounge with her books, but not until I'd actually looked at her --- I mean, really looked at her. It dawned on me that as the rest of us were struggling with the classic \\"frosh 15\\" weight gain (apples were a healthy response), my frosty companion had been going far more rapidly in the opposite direction, hiding her appearance under baggy clothes and a barbed personality that discouraged interaction.    If awareness of her self-starvation failed to catch my attention over three months, how long would it take others, with whom she did not share living space, to notice? When she dropped out \\"for personal reasons\\" in the midst of final exams, my former roommate (I was told later) weighed just 73.5 pounds.    And that's what also happened to the Australian child model turned actress and then author Portia de Rossi, who in the depth of her all-consuming illness tipped the scales at less than 80 pounds and was on the verge of multiple internal organ failure and irreparable bone and nerve damage. No one seemed to \\"notice.\\"    In UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS, de Rossi captures the powerful and insidious way in which the demon of distorted physical perfection subverts both the psychology and identity of its victims. It can go by a number of medical names --- the most familiar being anorexia and bulimia, or deprivation and deliberate purging. But as de Rossi repeatedly and memorably points out, an eating disorder is most often a tyrannical cluster of self-imposed behaviors that can lead victims from the heady illusion of successfully being in control of their image, down to the uncontrollable reality of imminent death.    Many of us who have never dieted, exercised or purged so far beyond healthful benefits admittedly have a difficult time taking this so-called \\"princess problem\\" seriously, because it is so exclusively an affliction rooted in societal affluence and stability. Initial responses to the revelation of someone suffering from anorexia, particularly among those we regard as successful and privileged, are more likely to be irritation, indignation, disgust or denial, rather than genuine concern and sympathy. After all, more than two-thirds of the world's population is chronically malnourished or well into starvation existence, according to UN World Health Organization standards. Anorexia is virtually unknown in areas where there has never been enough to eat.    But de Rossi cuts through all the constraints of say-nothing good manners and political correctness by telling it like it is right from the start. While she could have laid substantial blame at her family's feet for initially sowing the seeds of disaster during her years as a starving, binging child model, she doesn't go that route. It would be too easy, too hurtful and too self-absorbed.    After a decade of slow, steady and reflective recovery, combined with a happy and stable marriage to celebrity spouse Ellen DeGeneres, de Rossi has brought to this difficult but welcome book a compelling objectivity. Above and beyond her own personal struggle, UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS reveals uncompromisingly that Western society as a whole needs to wake up to the dangers of an affliction caused and perpetuated by its own perverse standards of perfection.    Instead of using her considerable influence and media profile to gain attention through vanity or notoriety, de Rossi determinedly moved outward to affirm every woman's right --- and moral necessity --- to be wholly herself in mind, body and spirit. In effect, she has declared open war against society's big, bad, and often fatal lie that \\"you can never be too thin.\\"    I wish my briefly encountered university roommate could have read UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS. But I learned decades later that, unlike de Rossi, she didn't make it.        --- Reviewed by Pauline Finch

As of this writing, there are 921 reviews here (!), so I won't comment on the plot except to say a middle-class Japanese family is transported into a magical world were the rule of reality don't apply.<br /><br />I will say that I saw this film a year or so ago.  One mark of the personal importance of a film is if it comes back to you when someone asks about films they should see, or if snippets of the film pop into your mind unbidden.

It's predictable, it's upbeat, and true to Jennifer Lopez's predictible rom-coms - which fortunately, for this movie anyway, was a box offie hit.  He (McConaghy) plays a pediatrician, she (Lopez) plays a wedding planner. The opening scene actually tells you right away who Lopez is as it takes place at a church, and she's reassuring the bride in a templ;ate script she recites to all brides.  We don't know anything about the man (McCognahy) until he saves Lopez from a stuck manhole (stiletto yet!) and when Lopez awakens, she is in a child's bed and a child ready to maul her.  There is a lot of back and forth, to and fro, and way to go...if you like a little chuckle even knowing the way this movie will end, see \\"The Wedding Planner\\" - a definite, a total, chick flick--not a chick fest, but a chick flick!

B000065KH4|5.0|I have always loved this movie from the story line to the music to the way the director sets the mood. Oh and the fact that Johnny Depp is in it is just a lovely bonus. This is the way I imagine Depp in France. Fall in love with your senses with Chocolat.
B003INBOEM|5.0|This is an excellent rendition of the self-made man, seeking his highest self while helping others ascend to heights they themselves never saw or thought possible.  Great martial arts? Yes.  AWEsome philosophy?  Yes.  Worth the time investment and a good sound system (despite being dubbed and subtitled)...? Yes.  Should you buy it?  Debatable.  There are good martial arts flicks; and then there are GOOD martial arts flicks.  The last time I recommended a \\"buy,\\" I myself purchased HERO with Jet Li.  I'd rent this one again; but probably would not buy it.
038533348X|2.0|While I perhaps understood the overall point of the novel (i.e. that science may be truth but it can and will destroy man; whereas, a system of bliefs such as Bokonism allows man to live in harmony even if this peace and harmony is built on harmless untruths), I think Vonnegut could have done a better job at telling the story.  The story \\"bounced around\\" a bit too much for me and as a reader, I did not know what to focus on, and after a while, did not care. Unlike Slaughterhouse Five, I did not find this book at all funny (was it supposed to be?) although I suspect that Vonnegut intended the reader to take humor in the medical condition known as midgetism. (FAIL!) I've read worse books, to be sure; nevetheless, I could have left this one on my shelf.

I dont know anyone that has not tapped their foot to a stones beat.. They are a entity to the music industry and a great example to young people of how to play with soul....On this record,, is  a very warm and glowing 60`s buzz with great blues and rhythym ,,  i recommend any album of theirs in a big way you cant go wrong

0879309210|5.0|The fact is many people play guitar and have no idea of how to maintain it other than changing the strings. As long as you have a good repair shop nearby that's usually all you need... or is it? If you're one of those people who have to know what it is you're holding, driving, playing and/or what can make it work that much better then this book is a must. It covers every square inch of both electric and accoustic guitars, giving you a thorough explanation of how to reach a fine standard of playability and beyond in a casual, easy to read style. What's more is it explains many of the problems repairmen and luthiers actively work to solve in a deceptively simple looking instrument. While it doesn't cover every after-market solution to every adjustment problem it does cover the essential tools and  techniques necessary that should enable the reader to repair and/or tune any guitar.<br /><br />I was skeptical this book was worth the price until it arrived. Over 1 inch thick, excellent photos, clear layout and the included DVD is a treasure of information that would take you quite a while to accumulate for free off the net and even more time to organize. It's no wonder old copies sell for close to the price of a new one.<br /><br />After you've jumped into fine tuning you might go a step further by learning how your instrument was made. Check out Melvyn Hiscock's \\"Make your own electric guitar\\" to see common boards, steel, copper and magnets become that amazing thing we all aspire to play our best.<br /><br />Outstanding value.
0375831002|5.0|This is probably the best YA book I have ever read, and I read alot.      I often read YA novels from time to time, they are quick, easy reads and I enjoy many of them.  None of them have captured my heart the way The Book Thief did.  It's a wonderful, creative, captivating story.  It's so unique as the narrator of the story is the grim reaper, or so easily put, death. SPOILER ALERT**.  What I also enjoyed was that this story takes place in an era (WWII) Germany, which many stories we've read and movies we've seen delve into this very dark time in Europe.  However almost all of the stories out there in this time period focus on captured victims, persecutation, etc.  Zusak has taken this same period but flipped it to tell the tale of \\"safe\\" Germans in this time period and the poverty and war that strikes around them.    It is a remarkable journey of a book.  Both tear jerking and exciting.  I highly recommend this book to any reader.

0793563836|5.0|My story is a little different from most. I learned to play \\"bass violin\\" in Junior High, and I played through my first year of college (on electric bass.) At some point along the way I sold my gear and didn't touch a bass for 25 years. Five years ago I got the urge to play again.  I had to start from scratch, including buying a new bass and amp. I also bought Ed Freidland's book and began working my way through each exercise on every page. With steady effort I was able to read standard notation within two weeks.  I began playing at church every week and my skills improved. I now play at two churches every week and still go back to Ed's book occasionally just to stay fresh with the fundamentals. Good stuff, Ed!
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Okay, it's not a perfect movie but I would give this an ABSOLUTE A for Effort because it's so boldly going where no film has gone before - into subject matter that is vital to our understanding of history (and our current situation) as well as into ideas and a world view that have never been presented in film. Agora fills in a huge missing chapter in two ways - first the literal one - the telling of a tale placed in 5th century Alexandria. Second, the subject matter and worldview level...Much of what we have in ancient history films (war movies: Spartacus, Oliver Stone's Alexander the Great; soap operas: HBO's Rome series; or boxing pix: Gladiator, etc.) is from the point of view of let's say a contemporary General Patton or a Muhammad Ali  - i.e. a military history or a boxing/wrestling match (gladiator movies). Think what a distorted view of modern history you would have if that is all you learned of our own times.     Agora is audacious in going into other topics from ancient history - philosophers, the history of astronomy, a famous woman professor of mathematics, contemporary pagan subjugation by Christian zealots - that we never see on the screen. And not only do we see them but in glorious computer graphics. Alexandria comes to life in this film - a life we can no longer experience in Alexandria or anywhere on earth. Even the selection of the actors is based on portraits from the times.     If the characters and the plot sometimes try to do a little too much, it's forgiveable, to me, because the overall value is incredible. I only wish the director was assigned to do more of these over his lifetime; we'd have better and better narratives, and equally stunning visuals.     This is richly imagined, beautifully executed and highly recommended!    I especially like the DVD extras - loving the interview with the director, writer, producer, and production design team.    I am buying three more copies to gift to friends this holiday season as I think this is a moviethat passed by most of its real audience and also the DVD extras are a huge value add (unlike most DVDs).
B000HIVIOW|1.0|? ? ?  When my kids were little, I bought a VCR tape of The Snowman that has the most peaceful music I've ever heard, which is why I could play the tape every day without getting tired of overhearing it.  The main premise of this story is that it does not include any human interference.  Each viewer (or reader of the wordless book version) has to imagine what's being said.    Now that my kids are grown, I bought the DVD version for my day care kids so that I wouldn't wear out my VCR tape.  The DVD version includes terrible vocals dubbed over the most pleasant part of the music of this movie.  I was horrified.  When I mentioned it to my daughter, she said that I was surely mistaken because that would ruin the whole tone of the movie.      A review of the VCR tape proved that, sadly, I was not dreaming.  I can't imagine what possessed the manufacturer to tarnish this lovely story with someone singing over the beautiful notes of the instruments AND NOT MENTION IT IN THE ADVERTISEMENT YET.  I will REALLY treasure my VCR tape now!
0307269752|2.0|Just finished reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  It wasn't Bad Bad ala Twilight, but I'm just not seeing how this turned into a hit bestseller.  The pacing is terrible, the twists absurd, every time an interesting threat to a character comes up it gets solved within one chapter, leaving us 600+ pages to read about if the main character can win back his honor after a libel case.  Seriously, the one mystery that runs from beginning to end in this book is about libel.  Murder, sadism, those get 12 pages, but libel case, and a disappearance mystery so obvious it belongs on Scooby Doo run the rest of the book.<br /><br />Our protagonist starts off having lost a lawsuit against him for libel.  He said bad things about a powerful industrialist based on a tip from an old friend.  The friend wants to remain off the records, so our protagonist can not produce his source, and thus looses a lawsuit. This means not just a hefty fine, but a stint in jail. The jail part apparently is no big deal, a vacation of sorts.  In fact nothing really bothers our main character.  Even when, later on, his life is in danger, it is all just part of the day.  The really big issue is if he did in fact write a false article, or if the industrialist he wrote about really was a bastard who deserved it.  Someone it takes us 600+ pages to get to that.<br /><br />In the meantime, several sub-mysteries pop up.  The \\"main\\" one involves another wealthy industrialist whose nice was supposedly murdered decades ago.  Of course no body was ever found, and \\"someone\\" has been sending him the same birthday gifts the dead girl used to provide, but we are nevertheless supposed to treat this as a \\"locked room\\" murder mystery.  Along the way, the protagonist runs into the title character, \\"the girl with the dragon tattoo.\\"  The tattoo itself is never explained in any way, and her character is never flushed out.  We do know that she is preternaturally intelligent, and put upon by a harsh and sadistically unfair system.  She gets her revenge in spades, however, without expending much effort or more than one chapter in doing so.  Perhaps the character gets more depth in future books, but she doesn't have it here.<br /><br />For about 50 or so pages, a real mystery seems to appear, involving a serial killer who has been around for decades.  He turns out to be both largely irrelevant and remarkably easy to defeat.  The intricate patterns laid down, like the tattoos on the main character, are left to signify little.<br /><br />In the end we are left with two characters who don't really seem to care about much, who easily defeat enemies, and whose main struggles are really about being judged harshly by a few people.<br /><br />There are the elements of a fine mystery and character series buried in this book.  Perhaps, with good editing, they come out better in the film.  Maybe the next book is better.  The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, however, is likely only enjoyed if the only other choice is a long Swedish winter.She gets her revenge in spades, however, without expending much effort or more than one chapter in doing so.

B0044LNR88|5.0|***SPOILER ALERT!***I fully intend to tell just about everything. Read at your own risk.<br /><br />Our hero's journey to the end begins with death, believe it or not. After being stabbed in the gut by the self-promoted, General Zod, Clark is left for dead in the middle of the streets of Metropolis. Of course, Lois finds him. As she weeps over her lost love, Clark is trapped in some kinda Kryptonian purgatory. While in this near-death threshold, he is told by Jor-el that he, basically, gave up on his life and the lives of the humans he has sworn to protect. Granted, given the situation he was confronted with, he really didn't have any other choice. Of course, he coulda just sent them all to the Phantom Zone, but not all the Kryptonians were as purely evil as \\"General\\" Major Zod. Therefore, I can see why he didn't go that route. Anyway, after viewing his tombstone and seeing Lex lurking in the distance, our hero is awakened by his lady love, who pulls the blue kryptonite dagger from his body. She decides to honor his wish of superpower secrecy and hides before he awakens. Our hero arises and is immediately healed by the sun and superspeeds away, to Lois' delight.<br /><br />Clark goes to Watchtower, where Chloe tells him absolutely NOTHING about Oliver's kidnapping. Clark informs her about seeing Lex. He goes to the Daily Planet to find a file on Lex's secret labs in the archives and guess who's there? Yep, Lois, who is searching for further insight into The Blur's(Man,I'll be glad when they get rid of that name)early saves. She pretends to drop a pen and look for it under the desk. She was very obvious, in her attempt to be inconspicuos..to us, anyway. Clark's never been big on noticing the obvious. He superspeeds to get the file while she's under the desk and he miraculously finds the file in a nearby pile, just as she \\"finds\\" her pen. She tells him that they need to talk and asks him to meet her in the barn.<br /><br />Clark calls Chloe to see if she can get him some info on Cadmus, however she is unable to assist him because she's at the JSA brownstone trying Dr. Fate's helmet on for a peek at the future: \\"Foolish girl, not chosen. Naboo knows\\". She puts the helmet on, passes out and Clark takes her to Dr. Hamilton.<br /><br />Meanwhile,back at Cadmus, Tess, who had half her face burned off in \\"Salvation\\", awakens with some weird goo on her face. She pulls it off and realizes her face has been restored to normal. She checks the place out and comes across an assortment of Lex Luthors. Most are grotesque and disfigured, with the exception of LX15: a little red-headed boy named Alexander. She hears banging on a door and goes to open it like an idiot. An older, more \\"evolved\\" Lex attacks her and sets the lab on fire.<br /><br />Chloe awakens from her unconcious state and tells Clark that Cadmus is burning. Clark superspeeds away and Chloe bids him farewell in a whisper.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lois is waiting for him in the barn and comes across his primary colored outfit in all it's glory. The old Lex clone shows up and knocks Lois out.<br /><br />Clark arrives at Cadmus and finds Tess tied up. He's kinda skeptical about setting her free, but he does and Tess tells hime that the Lex clone is waiting for him in Lawson's Field.<br /><br />The Lex clone ties Lois to a stake and paints an \\"S\\" on her chest, just like the one that was painted on Clark when Whitney decided to \\"scarecrow\\" him in high school. Lex tells Lois that her death will break Clark, who arrives at Lawson's Field to face-off. Lex tells Clark many truths and lies. Lex tells Clark that he can, either, save the Daily Planet's globe from crashing down on innocent bystanders or save Lois. Furthermore, he insists that Clark can't save both at once. Well, he does.<br /><br />After, performing his supersave, he goes to the barn to retrieve his \\"technicolor\\" suit, but is denied by Jor-el, who brings, both, Clark and the suit to the fortress. Jor-el tells Clark that he is the evil that needs to be fought. He tells him that he cannot be a beacon of hope with darkness in his heart. Of course, Clark has no idea what that means. Oh, but for a second, he thought he was flying(whatever!).<br /><br />Oliver spends the majority of the his time being tortured by Rick Flag, the leader of the Suicide Squad. Chloe turns herself over to the Suicide Squad in exchange for Ollie's freedom. Lois goes to Africa to free Clark of the distraction of being in a relationship. Clark comes home to find a very short note from Lois stating that she couldn't pass up Africa. Clark, then, sees Jonathan working on a fence. I'm sorry, I still don't get this part. I guess the point was some kinda hero encouragement. He warns him about the darkness and disappears. Then, we get to see the \\"Darkseid\\" entity coming outta that birdbath that sent the Kandorians to their new home. Finally, we get to see that beautiful suit one more time as it's being held captive by Jor-el. He's not allowed to have it until he's earned it.

B0045ODPKY|1.0|I am really surprised that Angelina Jolie played in this movie and allowed the director to fill it with non-stop swearing!  Angelina, put a muzzle on your director for your next movie, please!  I mean, every minute there was a four letter word coming out of someone's mouth that made the movie very distasteful.  But, here is my big complaint... the PG-13 rating on the movie rates it for action and violence, but does not even mention language.  Go figure.

I can't make enough good comments about this book and I don't generally like historical fiction.  I also loved Pillars of the Earth but my husband thought this book was better.

B002ZG976U|3.0|It's a musical, so there's going to be some cheese. There were giggles from some of the audience at certain parts. But who cares. It's fun. Simple story with stock characters, but comes together in an overall appealling package. It doesn't have the depth nor underlying themes of \\"Chicago\\", and isn't a visually stunning. Doesn't have the artistic reach of \\"Molin Rouge\\". It's like a performance by the Passy Cat Dolls - fun, entertaining, lush, but not deep. Showcases \\"Christina Aguilera\\". The talent - Cher, Eric Dane, Kristen Bell, Peter Gallagher, Julianne Hough and especially Alan Cumming and Stanley Tucci are overqualified and underutilized. But like a chilled rose at a casual picnic, it's enjoyable for what it is.
B000024P3A|5.0|I recently received this cd I ordered and it is a good one. I've been hearing \\"Chuck's Beat\\" on an internet oldies station and ordered it just for that song. But throw in Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf along with Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry and you've got one of the all-time great blues albums. And I'm not that big of a blues fan!
B00192IV9U|3.0|Reviewing the album as it is, \\"Michael\\" is a sufficient, occasionally good and occasionally so-so production.  Of course, as has been evident from the start, most people with an interest in this CD and Mr. Jackson himself will find it hard to ignore the surrounding controversies behind its making.    Whereas his most recent all-new album, \\"Invincible\\" was (like most of Jackson's CD-era output) perhaps overstretched to near 80 minutes, this disc is comparatively short at about 40 minutes.  As a whole, I still prefer \\"Invincible\\" to this.  You could remove the fluff from \\"Invincible\\" and have an amazing disc, whereas removing the duds on this album would leave you essentially with an EP's worth of songs.  \\"Keep Your Head Up\\" is a fairly by-the-numbers ballad while \\"Breaking News\\" and \\"Monster\\" are perhaps overly busy, though not altogether terrible.  Catchy?  Sure, somewhat.  Envelope-pushing pop?  Unfortunately, no.  And that's saying nothing about these tracks' vocals being the ones that sound a bit un-Michael.      To that end I could honestly believe all three plausible scenarios: they are completely Michael's vocals (having gone through the editing/tuning/production wringer); they are both Michael's and someone else's together; or they are not Michael's at all.  Of course, having no valid proof one way or another, I try to avoid the issue.  Best case scenario, if these are his vocals, they are arguably among his least gripping and exciting.    \\"Hold My Hand\\" and \\"Another Day\\" are both well done, and perhaps the least controversial inclusions here.  Both had been worked up in the last decade to, if you believe the leaked versions, near completion while Michael was still alive.  And both hold their own as above-average pop songs  (though MJ did not write either of them).  Perhaps the very newest song here, \\"Best of Joy,\\" was written by Michael and does sound unlike anything he's done before melodically.         Interestingly, many people have complained that thesetracks should not be released on the merit of other producers' musical input, with Jackson obviously no longer here to approve or disapprove.  While that certainly deserves discussion, the fact is that producers have ALWAYS contributed SIGNIFICANTLY to an artists' overall sound--Michael Jackson included.  In fact, much of the \\"Dangerous\\" album's sound comes courtesy of Teddy Riley, who is very involved on this latest album.  He has never been shy about stating how he often would serve as architect, creating soundscapes for Michael's melodies.  Of course, the argument could still be that MJ still had input on other people's contributions, but with all of the producers here having worked with him previously, I tend to put a little more trust into their instincts in terms of what Michael was going for.      The one exception to that rule is the otherwise fantastic \\"The Way You Love Me.\\"  To start the song with MJ's recorded instructions for the song's drum rhythm is great--but to then not follow up on it in the finished production (instead going for a rather dumbed-down beat) is counter-intuitive.  I like the song, but was it necessary to include here?  Sony's claims that the 2004 \\"Ultimate Collection\\" version was a demo seem unfounded (there were demos on that box set, but this was not stated as one).  In fact, that version reflects much more closely Jackson's percussive intent.      The real treat, \\"Behind The Mask,\\" is an interesting melding of old (vocals sound circa 1989, song samples/covers a late 1970's obscurity) and new (production, beat, etc.).  Jackson's vocals here are at their most flexible and interesting.  The track that follows (and closes the set), \\"Much Too Soon,\\" does what the rest of the album does not: keep it simple.  Here, Michael sings behind minimal acoustic instrumentation.  The song has the intimate feel of \\"She's Out of My Life,\\" or even \\"Time Waits for No One\\" (from the Jacksons' 1980 \\"Triumph\\" album) and the intangible--and untouchable--emotive quality of Michael's singing.  Some reports claim Jackson came back to this song regularly but never found the right fit for it on an album, and that this version's vocals may have been recorded as late as the \\"HIStory\\" sessions in 1994-95.  That seems plausible, as the sound of his voice here is not unlike that on \\"Childhood\\" or \\"Little Susie,\\" similarly intimate ballads from \\"HIStory.\\"     Not knowing details like that can be frustrating to die-hard fans looking for any factual information on these posthumous releases.  But the booklet is not terribly informative on recording dates or background on the songs in general.  It is unfortunate because it is in not knowing that the controversy is created.

B00004Y6NP|5.0|Ok, This is not the best of the Dire Straits catalog but is one of the best rock albums released in the 80's.   This is the evolution of the Dire Straits sound with more complex and modern produccion... not in the same vibe as the great rockin' roller early works (Dire Straits, Makin' Movies, Love Over Gold)but not bad at all.     Here are many classics in the Dire Straits repertoire as \\"Brothers In Arms\\" (a really beautyful antiwar song with a great guitar work, maybe the best of Mark on this album), \\"Money For Nothing\\" (with this legendary guitar riff), \\"Walk of Life\\" (a light rock tune with a beautiful keyboards work and great melody... fantastic) but are others songs with a quiet, soft and great acoustic guitar melodies like \\"Why Worry\\" (the most beautiful song in a whole album)and most atmospheric as \\"Ride Across The River\\" (wonderful sound with a great guitar and percussion works)or the now classic \\"Your Latest Trick\\" with a very romantic sound and a amazing saxo solo.  If You want to hear a great album with beautiful songs, an all time classic...Ok this is your chance.  Buy it and you're not regret.
0689865384|4.0|Uglies tells the story of Tally Youngblood, a 15-year-old girl living in a future dystopian society where all she can do is wait for her 16th birthday when she will finally be able to have the operation that makes her (and everyone else) pretty. And by pretty I mean perfect. We aren't talking about a nose job here, but a major reconstruction via future technologies of every thing that would make a person unique (and therefore ugly). No one is fat, short, tall, thin or even has bad hair. But while she's waiting for her transformation, Tally meets Shay and first hears about people who have run away from their perfect little city and from the one thing she has been waiting for her whole life; the surgery. They have actually chosen to remain ugly - forever. When Shay runs away as well, Tally goes in search of her new friend, but finds so much more than she bargained for.<br /><br />\\"Or maybe when they do the operation-when they grind and stretch your bones to the right shape, peel off your face and rub all your skin away, and stick in plastic cheekbones so you look like everyone else-maybe after going through all that you just aren't very interesting anymore.\\"<br />-- Scott Westerfeld (Uglies)<br /><br />This was a fun easy read and I found myself enjoying it immensely, while also finding some great themes, especially for younger readers. I also just loved the world Westerfeld created. We're talking hoverboards and walls that have the technology to give you anything you ask for. And I have to admit, even though I know others found it distracting, I got a little bit hooked on the slang his pretty-brained teens used. I still find a word or two of it slipping from my mouth on occasion only to realize that the person I'm talking to, just doesn't get the reference. At which point, I usually wish I had a copy of the book in my back pocket to throw at (er..give to) them with instructions to read it, and then come talk to me.<br /><br />Another thing I really admired about Westerfeld's book was that the characters managed to be sympathetic and intelligent, even though they were a product of a world which really didn't seem to care about fostering either. They enjoyed clothes and dreaming about looking beautiful, yes. But, unlike too many YA novels I've read of late, that was not who they were. It was certainly not the defining soul of any of the characters. Least of all Tally. She has a pretty huge character arc in the first book. With plenty of action. There's just so much to love, especially for young adults: the newness of the world that could easily be born of ours, the fun technology, the adventure, the language, and then the realization that there is something terribly wrong with their pretty little world, and very few capable of fixing it. This was absolutely enjoyable! I would note that while the first book alone is good, it's definitely a series read. He leaves us with a pretty tall cliffhanger at the end of the book and you won't want to wait to start the second one.haracters managed to be sympathetic and intelligent, even though they were a product of a world which really didn't seem to care about fostering either. They enjoyed clothes and dreaming about looking beautiful, yes. But, unlike too many YA novels I've read of late, that was not who they were.

B00000251N|5.0|As promised!  Super service and in new condition.  Our Mom recently passed away and in her funeral instructions we found she wanted this CD played.  Unfortunately we discovered this too late to order a DVD and her old cassette skipped.  When we play this CD we remember how much she enjoyed this beautiful music.  Thank you!
0316098337|3.0|I think the concept was facinating however I could have done w/ less babble from the boy. I think we're supposed to find this style of writing \\"cute\\" - I found it aggravating.   It was written from his point of view and in his words.  However his Mother taught him everything - He could do basic reading, writing, etc. at the age of 5 so I had trouble believing she didn't correct his speech.  Actually my daughter was raised in the outside world, among people talking \\"baby talk\\" to her, and I didn't allow her talk backwards so that probably increased my agitation w/ the wording. Other than that - some parts slow, some quick, overall it was ok.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|Paranormal Activity is a great horror flick. I was scared and that's the way I like it! Of course this film is not real but who cares, I still enjoyed this \\"demon\\" of a movie. I highly recommend it, enjoy!
030746363X|5.0|The Good:    This is probably the best nonfiction I've read in 2010. It doesn't take long to be convinced that the author is someone we should listen to (this man is clearly OBSESSED!!), but more importantly, the book is extremely readable. If I were to write a book on the same topic with the same information, it would probably come out reading like the DSM-IV, but Ferriss does a good job of including plenty of entertaining anecdotes and humor to help us along, not to mention simple and concise explanations.    As the subtitle promises, the content of the book is definitely uncommon. There are some very unusual techniques and advice that I've never seen before. However, the greatest uncommonness of the book is its \\"Tipping Point\\" approach to health. Following the trend of The 4-Hour Workweek, a major theme of The 4-Hour Body is how to see the most results from the least amount of effort. Ferriss is not necessarily saying that conventional wisdom (hard work, discipline, keeping up with research) is wrong--just that there's an easier and smarter way through hacking the human body. I think this approach works great for a generation with a low attention span and an immediate results mindset.    The Bad:    Critics are going to run wild with this book. Everything from advice on mixing different over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to consuming high amounts of cholesterol, to his claims of gaining more than 1 pound of muscle a day for a month are going to feed the fire for skeptics, trolls, and haters.    I, for one, believe it's impossible to gain 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days as he's claimed to have done. Yes, it is possible to gain that much total weight, mostly water, especially if you're an experienced dehydrator-rehydrator as he is, but muscle is completely different.    Claims like these are going to make a lot of people call the author a snake-oil salesman, and I think to an extent he is. While it will help him sell books, unfortunately I think it will also cause people to label him as a fraud and therefore dismiss all the other information that is definitely worth reading and considering.    The Ugly:    The author actually weighed his poop.    This was a guest review by Edward Bartlett. For his full review, please visit my book-review site, Melody & Words!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Bought it Saturday night, here by Wednesday afternoon. It was great service, able to track package the whole way to my home. It was great!
030746363X|5.0|I just received the book form Amazon and cannot put it down. Janyary 3 will be the first day of \\"the slow carb diet\\" for me and my husband. What a wonderful validation to what I have known for years. Thank you Tim Ferriss for writing this book. It is very much appreciated and needed in this world of instant gratification.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|great service, able to track package the whole way to my home and it was great service if I had any  questions! recommend to buy from them again.
030746363X|4.0|The book is great and Tim's ideas and research is proving true for me. I bought the book from Amazon when it premiered last Tuesday, received it on Thursday and started the slow carb diet on Saturday. I've lost 6 lbs so far. It doesn't even really feel like dieting. For example, I went to the neighborhood pub with friends after work tonight and had buffalo wings and a glass of Merlot for happy hour. I also recommended both of Tim's books to our waitress who is working 80 hours a week and also wants to lose weight. I give it 4 starts because of Tim's very conversational writing style and specific and data-driven suggestions which consider multiple points of view, arguments and objection. I haven't finished it yet, but what I've read - about the half the book so far - is fantastic. I'm the sure the rest of the book will warrant the 5th star.<br /><br />Speaking of work, I also bought The 4-Hour Workweek this summer and have read it twice so far. I've been testing the 'muse' income ideas and I'm well on the way to replacing my full time management salary (which supports a wife an 4 kids) within a year. I'm 38 now, and I fully expect to retire my job by 40.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|After reading other reviews for this, I was aware that it is censored, but I wanted it anyway.  There was no other version to get at the time.  I love the album!!  It is two discs and all songs are great if you are a fan!
B00428CPUY|2.0|was very disapointed seeing this concert in person and the dvd pretty much proves eric just can't thrill you like in the late 1970's and early 80's same thing over and over,  time to retire mr.c or bring in some of the other great guitarist of the past. who still can string together some exciting great riffs. don't waste your time or money, blues or music fans just watch one of the other past crossroads concerts.
B002MW50KO|1.0|Holy, moly.  This is the worst Christmas album in existence.  It's so bad I've considered that Dylan made it as a joke.  What was he thinking?
B003Y5H4SY|4.0|I liked this movie.  It had just enough of everything I enjoy in a movie minus the blood and nudity. I didn't think a PG movie would come off this well.
030746363X|1.0|This really isn't a \\"guide\\" to specific topics as much as it is a \\"list of favorite things\\" and a diary of a self-absorbed self-promoter. Very little information is actually contained in the voluminous tome. Indeed, that info that is there is often contradicted in later chapters.<br /><br />Unless you like reading the daily bathroom and eating habits of an immature jerk, save your money.
B004APVI1G|4.0|Wanted to add to the discussion the 3D.  This is beautiful to look at.  I can't imagine a better looking 3D movie...that was until I saw despicable me...which gets thumbs way up! There is very little ghosting in this movie.  The colors are sharp and clear. Another great looking 3D movie for home entertainment.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Law Abiding Citizen is in the Mold of Dirty Harry And Deathwish Movies(Although those are much better in my Opinion),Gerald Butler Did a great performance as did Jaime Foxx,but I think Butler stole the movie,I don't think the way he went about it,Instead of focusing on Just the evil he went all out and that wasn't cool, I don't condone the actions, I felt he should have just gotten the perp in the movie. Either way the movie's ending and just the way Butler's Character just gets out of hand I disliked,but the Idea itself behind the movie that The Justice System favors the Criminal's right before the Victims in most cases speaks volumes and there is truth to that,  When you have Liberals running the show,Activist judges and so fourth who want \\"Rehab\\" Instead of Minimum Mandatory Life Sentences for Violent Offenders/Repeat offenders. All In All the movie is worth watching as painful as it may seem,not exactly the best thing for Butler to have done.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|I've read several review's about the 3D and this is the best 3D movie I have every seen at home or in a cinema. The audio is perfect and the story is touching! bravo to all involved in making this gem.
0553328255|5.0|Bought this book as a gift for a friend and they loved it. They sit up late at night reading this book in bed, would definitely recommend this as a gift for others.
0307346617|5.0|Throughly enjoyed this book. I am currently reading it a second time. I enjoy the documentary approach to how human can back control of the world. I would recommend this book. I am an avid zombie fanatic, so having read many zombie books I would highly recommend this book!
B000V7FZ7U|3.0|I absolutely LOVE Simply Red- they're a great group and delightful live performers. However I must say I am disappointed at the video quality of this DVD. The 'Live in Sicilly' has a better video quality (HD), but I didn't like the camera work (annoying that director kept flashing everywhere every 3 secs), which is why I bought this one.     Audio quality is mediocre too. Live in Sicilly has better audio too.      As for the tracklist, it contains major hits like  'Stars', 'For your babies', 'Sunrise', 'Fairground', 'Money's too tight to mention', 'Something got me started', etc. Check the official Simply Red website for the full tracklisting. The one I really missed was 'You make me feel brand new', but I suppose you can't have everything...     Bottomline: as much as it's a great performance, it has great songs and camerawork was good, audio and sound quality are only mediocre.     PS: I had posted a review saying that sound quality was bad, and volume kept going up and down. My mistake- for all of you who changed to Mac recently, and use the default DVD player, it has an option called 'Dolby dynamic range compression'. DISABLE IT! It ruins everything.
0061537969|5.0|I know there are 1000+ reviews on this book but take my advice or leave it.  Either way you need to read thos book.  Looking for a great novel?  This is it.  I was told by a friend to read this and I was unsure at first. I am not quite a dog person, or really into racing.  But this story is beyond that.  If you can bring yourself to put it down while you are away from it you are waiting to get back to it.  I never thought I could love a book so much.  It speaks to you and brings emotions out of you that you never though a novel could.  You will find yourself waiving off responsibilities to read it, but its worth it.  I would tell anyone who enjoys to read to read this book.  Trust me, you wont regret it.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Most people I talked to said that the book was really slow. To be honest, the beginning of the book provides a lot of background. Be prepared for that, but do not stop reading. Once this book gets going, it is very exciting. It was hard for me to put it down.
0817439390|5.0|I'm a hobbyist and in my quest to learn as much about photography, I would say that this has been the best book I've read by far. I also like the Scott Kelby series, but I rate this is a tad above those. It is very informative and it is explained in layman's terms. I would definitely be looking into his other books.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I started watching Castle from the first episode of Season 1 and thoroughly enjoy it. The writing is excellent and intelligent and the acting is far above the average for television. Not to mention, any time you get to see Nathan Fillion is a plus! I recommend Castle wholeheartedly!

B000MCIBE8|4.0|The review by Adam Carter (June 30, 2007) is spot on in comparing the 1999 remaster and this new 2006 remaster.  The 1999 version of \\"Light My Fire\\" is clearly slower than the 2006 version.  A couple of comparisons: Jim sings \\"pyre\\" at 0:52 in the 1999 version and at 0:50 in the 2006 version.  Jim's final \\"Yeah\\" before the instrumental break occurs at 1:07 in the 1999 version and 1:04 in the 2006 version.  So, clearly one can hear the difference in speed.    However, the 1999 remaster has a much fuller sound than the 2006 version (at least on \\"Light My Fire\\" anyway).  The bass seems much stronger in the 1999 version.  The 2006 version does increase the volume of the drums on left and organ on right compared to Jim's voice in the middle so we lose a little of the vocal dominance in this song.  This is a shame because while I like the faster pace of the 2006 version, I really like the fuller sound and the darker mood of the 1999 version.  It just sounds better to have Jim's voice dominate the song at the beginning with the drums only remotely heard in the background.  Even though the 2006 version brings up the drums and organ, the overall sound is still much much thinner than the 1999 version.  It's like the treble parts of the drums and organ were increased but not the bass parts.  The sound seems to me to be very compressed in the 2006 version.     It's hard to believe that a new remaster in 2006 would have a thinner sound than a previous version but this is what we have.  I actually prefer the 1999 version although I wish is was faster.
B00192IV9U|5.0|Let me start off by advising the reader not to listen to the reviews for this album.  Make up your own minds, people!  So much of what is written about this release is ridiculous... I mean REE-DIC-U-LUS!!!  Why are people always looking for a scandal or some kind of covert plan?       I personally believe that ALL of the tracks on this record are by Michael Jackson.  The idea that an impersonator stepped in and supplied the vocals is totally out there.  The quality of the tracks (and vocals) vary due to the fact that they were recorded at different times using different recording equipment, yet all of them ARE MICHAEL JACKSON, and they are all very good.   In fact, I rate this album much higher than some of those issued by Michael during his lifetime.  It is more enjoyable than \\"Invincible\\" and \\"Dangerous,\\" and that is partly due to the songs attributed to the Cascios.  \\"Keep Your Head Up\\" and \\"Monster\\" are both good tracks, despite what others may say.    I, for one, am thankful for this album and highly, highly recommend it to casual and devoted fans.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This book is a fantastic read. The author writes about this complex subject in a way that's easy to understand and makes you want to learn more--I can't read the pages fast enough. However, to the content editor who let this one slip by, \\"Lucy\\" was not dug up by Louis Leakey. The bones were uncovered by Donald Johanson and Tom Gray in 1974. I'll put up with typos I always find in the Kindle editions I read (although that kind of sloppiness from publishers makes me grit my teeth--ebooks should be edited as precisely as hardcover books), but this factual mistake was too glaring to ignore. A brilliant book like this deserves better Simon & Schuster (as well as the customers buying it).
B0048LPRCS|3.0|First off, you've got to throw some props to the producers for having the stones to put together this utterly bizarre and, at times, mesmerizing depiction of consciousness after death.  Don't worry about spoilers, the agenda for the film is laid out for the audience early in the film, as one of the (many) seedy characters in this movie explains the Tibetan Book of the Dead to our anti-hero protagonist: first, you die; then, you relive pivotal moments of your life; and, finally, you choose your reincarnation.<br /><br />The film is almost entirely a first-person perspective of this person's life - and afterlife.  Early on, while our \\"hero\\" is among the living, it appears as if we're watching through his video camera while he films a conversation with his fellow-orphan sister (played by the comely, and fully on-display, Paz de la Huerta).  Then, we realize that we were actually listening and watching from inside this guy's head (once he looks into a mirror) while he launched on a major hallucinogen (presumably D.M.T.) before leaving to close a drug deal with his American buddy at a bar called \\"The Void\\".  The layered, densely beautiful, special effects from this initial hallucinogenic sequence make you sit up, startled, and realize that this is not anything close to standard Hollywood fare.<br /><br />It's at The Void where our hero's perspective (and ours) changes radically.  As the camera lifts from our hero's lifeless body (shot to death in a toilet by Tokyo cops), the perspective changes, so that - instead of seeing the world from his eyes, we see the world from ... behind the back of his head.  This annoying device leaves about 1/3 of each scene blocked off, with the guy's big head in the foreground, as he deals with the immediate events leading up to his demise.<br /><br />After about a half-hour of straining to see around the back of our hero's fat head, we get heavy CGI and truly inspired cinematography as he drifts from one event of his life (from infancy to adulthood) to the next, eventually ending up at the insanely-lit \\"Love Hotel\\" where he finds the source for his reincarnation (and the viewer is poked in the eye by nothing less than a glans in cervical thrust mode).  This scene, like so many others, is totally gratuitous and sickeningly over-the-top.  Clearly, the director (a likely disciple of Ken Russell) abhors subtlety.<br /><br />Like I said, you've got to throw some props at the producers for putting this insanity on film.  But why does our hero have to be a drug dealer?  He finally comes up with the money to bring his American sister to Tokyo and she ends up as a go-go dancer getting banged by Mario - the Japanese club owner.  Why so many seedy, drugged out, amoral characters?  Has anyone, including the screen writer, ever heard of the concept of comic relief?  There is no such relief in this relentless, pitiless exploration of this man's hellish life and the awful lives of those around him.  Drug abuse, close-up abortion, adultery, children orphaned by parents brutally killed in a car wreck, and relentless seedy sex do not a fun time at the movies make.<br /><br />I suppose watching a nightmare is more arresting than, say, watching a standard dreamy dream.  Linklater tried it - with very mixed success - in the overly-talky \\"Waking Life\\" back in 2001.  This film about life-after-death is at least as original as Linklater's effort, but is not nearly as entertaining (which doesn't say much for this film).<br /><br />Film-hounds will want to see \\"Enter the Void\\" for its groundbreaking CGI and amazing cinematography.  The soundtrack, all synthesizers and heavy bass, adds a sense of sublime foreboding to whole proceeding.  Taken together, it's all heady stuff, if you know what I mean.  ;)<br /><br />Most audiences will be repelled by the assaultive, relentlessly grim imagery, unappealing characters, complete lack of a plot or antagonist, and overall lack of coherence.  Far be it for me to speculate on what this film might have accomplished by introducing the concept of a loving God (who is totally M.I.A. in this film).  But, by filming this movie in godless Tokyo, it's clear that the film maker had another agenda in mind altogether.of a loving God (who is totally M.I.A. in this film).

B002ZG99CC|5.0|How could you be around in the 1980's and not love the original \\"Karate Kid\\" and its sequels [[ASIN:B0006OBPTA The Karate Kid Collection (Four Film Set)]]?  Well, I really liked the first movie.  I liked Ralph Macchio and especially liked Pat Morita in the original movie.  \\"Wax on, wax off\\".  The movie had some truly great memorable quotes and scenes.<br /><br />So I wasn't especially enthused about a remake of this old favorite of mine.  Remakes tend not to shine.  But I am very glad I bought this DVD.  I like the new \\"Karate Kid\\" as much, and maybe even more than, the 80's version.<br /><br />Jaden Smith definitely takes after his parents in the talent department.  Engaging, charismatic, athletic and a great actor.  I will look forward to seeing his talents on display in future movies.<br /><br />I have always loved Jackie Chan - and, in fact, his being in this movie is why I gave it a first viewing.  He can do drama, pathos, slapstick, action.<br /><br />Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith co-produced this movie.  Stellar job.<br /><br />The scenery was GORGEOUS - China in all its glory!  The Great Wall of China; the Forbidden City; the Bird's Nest; the monastery in the Wudang Mountains; the uncomparable karst hills of Guilin; and just the every day scenes throughout the movie.<br /><br />The story was formulaic but that was alright because it was done well.  I recommend this movie to young and old alike (there is some violence from bullying in the movie so maybe not extremely young children should watch this) but otherwise I think it is a great family movie.

B003ES61EE|4.0|The AmazonBasics Lens Pen Cleaning System has a retractable brush which is very effective in cleaning dust and small particles off the lens of our cameras.  It is easy to use with one hand, leaving the other free to keep a good grip on the camera. Under the cap on the end opposite the brush is a triangular shaped chamois glued onto a stem.  This does a good job cleaning smudges from the camera lens.  I cannot believe how many years we tried to keep our cameras clean by using a damp cloth or paper towel.  We will never go back to that!  This tool is 4-3/4\\" long, so it won't squeeze into our small camera bags.  If it was just ¾\\" shorter, I'd give it 5 stars.  However, it should fit into the bag of any serious camera buff and it does exactly what it promises.  I like it so much that I have bought one of these for each of my 11-year old granddaughters who get a fair share of smudges and dust on their camera lenses.

0307408833|5.0|First i want to say, this book is a must have for anyone with food allergies!! i bought this book when it first came out and have not stopped using it yet!!  i felt i needed to write a review after i saw it only had  three stars.. while the gluten-free reviewers were not happy with the title, it however does not say that all recipes are gluten-free..  let's face it, the author is NOT going to give her secret recipes away in her recipe book.. otherwise no one would come to her bakery! LOL  i have bought some items from the bakery and have to say that her cake tastes exactly as the recipe does!  as far as the icing, i have yet to get the right consistency however it still tastes like hers.  for those people who feel the coconut oil is too much $$,, i have no problem paying the price..  since i started using the coconut oil, my cholesterol has actually gone down!!  with the some of the recipes, i have used a few substitutions and have had no problems..  as far as the garbanzo bean flour, i don't think you really can taste it unless you are trying to.. i had made chocolate cupcakes with the garbanzo bean flour and gave one to my father who would never have tasted it if i told him it was in there and he didn't even notice!!  i hope there will be another recipe book in the works!!!
B002DYKP88|4.0|There's probably a lot of people who would call it sacrilege to describe Hero as a martial arts movie. The film relies very heavily on wire-fu, and the martial art performances take a back seat to flashy cinematography and art direction. Think Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with an even greater emphasis on atmosphere and just enough swordplay to qualify for the fringes of the genre.    While Hero will likely fail to deliver on any level for a martial arts fanboy (or girl), there's no question it possesses the 'martial arts vibe' under its high gloss facade. Jet Li and Donnie Yen are two of the stars, yet Donnie Yen's role is almost a cameo. And while the fight sequences are definitely about art over form, the fight between Li and Yen works well very well and it's too bad that it couldn't have been longer.     In the end, Hero would be best described as a martial arts flavored arthouse film. If that description doesn't sound like your cup of tea, I assure you Hero is not for you. Otherwise, enjoy!
B004G8ZZHU|4.0|As with other reviews, I too was skepticle on renting this show. I did like the 80's version, but that was then. The TV/movie trailer for today was a little mis-leading. I thoroughly enjoyed the show. Plenty of action (some obviously CG based) and a great cast. I never would have thought it was going to be this much fun to watch. Yes, there were scenes over the top, but look around at todays movies. Everyone is trying to make an extreme action movie with action sequences that are off the charts. This show does have them, but it's done in a way that's plausible to the original story line of the 80's and is just plain fun. Hope you agree.
B003INBOEM|4.0|Ip Man is a 'biopic' but - from the little I have read - it's probably only loosely based on its subject's actual life. Played by Donnie Yen (also seen in Seven Swords), Ip Man is a supremely talented martial artist who lives peacefully in Fo Shan, a place renowned for its martial artists. The Japanese invasion of China during WWII destroys his idyllic existence. Master Ip and everyone around him are suddenly poor and life becomes a brutal struggle for existence. In the movie, the former Fo Shan masters have to resort to going to a 'fight club' in order to earn bags of rice to stay alive. The film does a very good job of conveying the harsh existence of the time.    In the title role, Donnie Yen's serene presence works very well. I've noticed in all of his films that he has this calm but powerful vibe emanating from him. It makes him a great choice to play a martial arts master. However, he is also able to convey deep emotion just by very subtle things he does with his face or posture. For instance, when he smiles, it's so rare that it takes on major importance. When he calls the translator Li a traitor, there's a sudden hardness in his face that's just a shade different from his usual stoicism, but it's enough and it tells you everything you need to know. I found myself just watching him very closely because of this, and his performance rewarded the attention.    Admittedly, the plot of Ip Man is rather thin. There are several characters with arcs of one sort or another, but the movie ends up focused mostly on the horrors of life under the Japanese occupation as opposed to any deep insight into Master Ip or his philosophy (though there is certainly some of that to be found here). One big plus to this was that it left room for a lot of martial arts sequences to be smoothly woven into the story.     On the downside the focus on the occupation - especially through the dingy, depressing light in which these scenes are filmed - rendered Ip Man a bit cold and soulless attimes. I feel like a good martial arts movie, even one dealing with dark or tragic subjects, should still reflect the spirit of the martial arts (which is not about darkness or post-modern angst). While the movie clearly wants to convey the horrors of occupation, I think it would have been a better move (and more poignant) to rely upon the actors and characters to get this across. For example, the scene where Master Ip confesses to his wife how useless he feels was extremely touching, as was the scene when Yuan opens the mysterious tin box his brother had been searching for. The desperation of the millworkers and that of the bandits who blackmail them was also compelling, but this conflict really didn't go anywhere specific.    Overall, I liked Ip Man and found it very moving, and I guess I'm picking at it because it's good enough to merit that kind of dissection. Most importantly, the martial arts sequences in Ip Man are very good. Much of the close-in fighting is especially tight and furious (and from what I understand the Wing Chun form is more about fighting at close range). Master Ip and Master Liu (another of the former Fo Shan masters) both had moves that make you want to reach for the rewind button. There was also great work from the actor who played the scruffy challenger from the north. A few less cuts would have enhanced the WOW! factor at times, and there is some unneeded use of wire fu. Not dissing wire fu in total, but the fact is that the best martial arts movies are the ones where you can best see the artists showing their skills with 'no strings attached' (that's why we watch!). So if you have good artists in the movie, it should be used sparingly. That said, Ip Man definitely delivers plenty of good martial arts, as well as a great performance from Donnie Yen and very moving story. Excellent movie!
B0045ODPKY|5.0|Well written, well acted, great plot. It is hard to guess what comes next but everything is plausible as it unfolds. The action is very tight and brutal like the new Bond or Bourne films. Angelina and Liev are fabulous. Worth a couple watches.
B0043X7WLA|5.0|Another year has passed with so many great releases, yet Sufjan Stevens' \\"The Age of Adz\\" will stand at the top of my best-of list.  Another artistic leap from an artist already pushing boundaries. The 25 minute epic closer \\"Impossible Soul\\" may just be one of the greatest songs this decade.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and give this album some time with a good pair of headphones. If you do, it will reward you for years to come.
B000LAZDQA|3.0|I have mixed reviews about shortbus.  I heard about it here on amazon because of all the rave reviews and the appeal of the sexuality. In retrospect, I am confused on all the perfect reviews of this movie.  Beware! There are spoilers!<br /><br />From the beginning scene to the end, I was definitely enthralled and did not look away.  I am not used to seeing sex on film so raw, so real, so gay (sorry but I've never seen a gay porn) yet not be a porn movie.  For the most part, I thought the actors and actresses did a remarkable job.  How brave they all must be to bare all in a non-porn setting!  And I certainly admire the vision, or at least my interpretation of the vision, which is to show sex and relationships in a way Hollywood will never grant us--lifelike.  I like that it tries to demolish the uptight American view of sexuality and catch us up with the rest of the world (Europe, anyway.)  And I like that this movie was seemingly made for women and gay men; although I'm straight I liked the openness and relaxed nature that Hollywood would never portray to this audience.  The actors and actresses were very beautiful but in a realistic way; the female form never looked so good and was paired with men and women alike, without the unbelievable airbrushing and body doubles in movies today.  And it was kind of nice that the penis was not the forbidden genital like in all our movies outside of porn.  But there many things I did not particularly like- at times the story and the acting were lacking.<br /><br />The story I liked at times but overall it felt shallow and poorly thought out.  And some things did not make a lick of sense.  A sex therapist that is pre-orgasmic and blows up at her clients, physically assaulting them?  And after, following them to a sex club without her love being aware?  What sense did it make that Jennifer (sorry severin) formed a bond with our troubled sex therapist by taking a polaroid of an unbelievable dialogue between Sofia and a group of strangers?  I guess the therapist had no awareness that her view on sex and her sex life was sad, pathetic, and misguided.<br /><br />Rob seemed to be pretty damn carefree regarding Sofia's actions throughout the whole movie.  I don't know if this was poor writing or acting.  I also like how Sofia never consulted her true love one time before kissing or touching strangers.  Nor did most of the characters for that matter, save James and Jamie, and their ease of bringing a stranger into the relationship was totally unbelievable.<br /><br />And the vibrator scene?  Completely ridiculous.  In this scene both Sofia and Rob failed miserably in selling this to the audience.<br /><br />And the worst part of this movie by far was the stalker.  Wow.  Anything to do with that poorly written and performed character was completely unbelievable and laughable.  He works from home and has been watching and following everyone for years without anyone noticing.  Right.  I don't care if you're gay or straight or what- you would call the cops in a second and be furious if you found that you had a stalker.  Why did Jamie have sex with him at the end of the movie? And why did his frantically worried partner smile at him across the alleyway?  Don't you think James would have been a little upset?  Thanks for the call to let me know you're alive Jamie, and I'm glad your sleeping with a creep 20 feet from our place.<br /><br />I'm glad Sofia finally discovered an orgasm; you'd think being a sex therapist and all she'd have the resources or at least be able to seek professional assistance to resolve this before now.<br /><br />The ending... How disappointed I was to see everything wrapped up in a neat little happy package at the end of the movie just like all our Hollywood mainstream movies.<br /><br />I know this review is harsh especially in comparison to the others, and I know that alot of hard work was put into this, but overall it was just ok and it certainly doesn't deserve all the perfect ratings.t ratings.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is a nice set, because it has both the black & white and colorized versions to keep everyone happy. I haven't watched the black & white version, but it is listed as \\"pristine\\". The color version was 100 times better than the VHS version released years ago. The original black and white version is always the best way to view this classic, but it was neat seeing it in color.

B00192IV9U|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums what released.    IF U ARE MJ FANS THEN RATE IT WITH 5 STARS , COZ ITS MJ... HOW U CAN  RATE IT WITH 4 or 3 or 1 Stars If u're MJ FANS..      This is GREAT ALBUM , with great songs.      but $ony is $ony... nobody can change this.
B00430EQK8|5.0|First of all, the Blu-Ray image and sound are exceptionally good.  The image has excellent depth and clarity, and the DTS track is outstanding.  The disc contains a good variety of highlights (not complete scenes, but long enough to give you a good feel for the production) from each of the four operas.      I was impressed with the lighting and video effects throughout, and overall, the singing and acting are of consistently high quality as well. There are some costumes that I didn't like at first, but having watched it several times now, I'm getting used to them.  I don't mind that they mixed styles ranging from a Flintstone-style bone bodice for Sieglinde, to a futuristic belt that looks like something out of Kubrick's 2001 for Wotan, but some of the choices are just weird.  It also took me a while to get used to seeing singers hoisted aloft on hydraulic lifts, but again, it's just a new way of seeing things.  I had been a little apprehensive about the acrobats, but they sort of blend in with the rest of the action and I didn't find them at all distracting.      The high point for me was the way the videos and the lighting were so brilliantly used to underscore the music.  This Ring is so visually appealing that I'm willing to forgive a few unfortunate costume choices as well as a couple singers who are truly Wagnerian in size.  For the price, it's a great way to get a good look at this production and decide if you'll want to invest in the entire set.  I'll probably be ordering it after I've watched this a few more times to see how it holds up over time, but so far, it keeps getting better.    Edit:  After watching this at least 5 times (yes, it's that good), I ordered the entire set (at a great discount from another retailer, sorry Amazon).  Any reservations I had about costumes, large-scale singers, and the hydraulic lifts have disappeared with repeated viewings.  The production values, the musical performances, and the Blu-Ray's outstanding video and audio quality won me over and make this set indispensable.      I forgot to mention in my original review that the subtitles are done really well, too.  They are clearly visible, but they don't intrude too much on the image.  It looks as if they used a narrower font size than the Levine/MET production.  Also, this sampler disc includes two features about the stage director and the video creator.  Both features are very well done and help the viewer to understand the concept behind this production.  Both are presented in HD.  At this price, I can highly recommend this disc to anyone remotely interested in the Ring or this production.  Just give it a chance and let it grow on you!

193659434X|5.0|I had a tough-as-nails 7th grade English teacher. Her ruthlessness nearly scared the puberty out of me, but she was one of the most inspirational people I've ever known. It was she who introduced me to Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. I knew some of the movies well and the Disney cartoon, but she made sure we read the book. And by read I mean she passed out books to the class, pressed play on the audiobook-on-cassette version, and had us follow along with the reader for the entire period. And then she collected all the books at the end of class. We repeated this process for a week or so all the way through to the end--\\"God Bless Us, Every One!\\"<br /><br />The story remains as lyrical now as I first discovered then. I cannot imagine Christmas or literature without it. The tone is nearly perfect watching Ebenezer Scrooge transform from a cold, old miser into a human being that desires another chance to give back to the world.<br /><br />To fully appreciate the language, I recommend listening to it or reading the story aloud.
B00192IV9U|5.0|My favorite songs on the \\"Michael\\" album in rank order are:   1. \\"Best of Joy\\"  2. \\"I Like the Way You Love Me\\"  3. \\"Much too Soon\\"   The above three songs prove that Michael Jackson was indeed only on loan from God's Heavenly Chorus of Angels.     Meanwhile life becomes a whole lot sexier when you listen to:   \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" and   \\"Behind the Mask\\"    The \\"Michael\\" album will have a very long shelf-life of record sales. \\"Word of Mouth\\" will take \\"Michael\\" into the homes and hearts of millions of people all over the world; because there is simply no better music out there.  ENJOY!!!!!
B004DPT4O6|4.0|I first found out about the book thru a review in People magazine. I was curious, but  not that excited. When I saw the Audiobook in the library, and just grabbed it, figured it's my chance. The audiobook is read by a British woman and she makes a bunch of British accents, so I definitely think it added to the story bc it does take place in England.    I REALLY liked this book. I like the witty writing, the sarcastic humor, the tension you could feel between the 2 main characters Dexter and Emma. This book did a really good job of creating many scenes in England. Even though I've never been there I can really picture the type of flat that they lived in  from different neighborhoods - rich/poor, the types of people, etc.     My favorite part about this book is that you can follow these characters across time, and see how people's lives grow, change, interweave, separate and come back again. I loved seeing this progression. Many novels take a day in a life or a month or a year. This book REALLY lets you watch as these character mature and grow older. This aspect alone makes this book VERY different from others and REALLY creates a satisfactory feeling when all is said and done. You know how sometimes you'll watch a movie and even though you are glad a problem is resolved but you REALLY want to see what happens next? Well this whole book is all about WHAT happens NEXT. Loved the idea!    Moving on... the pace is not too fast and not too slow. I didn't give it the full 5 stars because there were many times when something happened in the character's life and that plot line just dropped off and went nowhere. So you really wanted to know what happened to this or that, but it was not concluded or explained, for ex Dex and Tilly, Silvy and Cullen, how did Dex and Emma end up in Greece? did they have sex there? Many unanswered questions. However, these things really do not DETER from the overall MOVEMENT of the book, so in that I am happy.   I definitely recommend this book to others. A GREAT satisfying read!
0143117564|3.0|Enjoyable \\"beach\\" reading.  File under \\"pop.\\"  The characters lean without straining toward being just interesting enough that you may wish they were developed better, or at least more uniformly.  While Pynchon seems to want us to think he wrote the whole thing on a layover, it's clear that he had to forcibly arrest the characters from escaping the iconic hard boiled detective motif and emerging into something resembling dramatic farce. Loses steam in the last 60 pages or so.  Finished it on principle, so I didn't care that the ending was diffuse.  Definitely a page-turner, though, with hints of the sly Pynchon throughout.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|The West Wing Series is a beautiful collector set for anyone who enjoyed the series on television.  I bought it for my husband for Christmas and he has already watched all 45 DVD's.
B002ZG9940|5.0|One of the best films of 2010, but only a few people think so. Sure this film isn't for everyone. It's slow, deliberate, methodical, and detailed. It's fascinated with images more than action. It presents small character movements instead of large story arcs. And for what it's trying to achieve, it's perfectly shot, acted, and directed. And for those who love the pure cinema, it's the perfect kind of film.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay<br />by Suzanne Collins<br /><br />NOTE! If you have not read The Hunger Games or Catching Fire, this will reveal spoilers for the first book!<br /><br />Story Title: 5/5<br />Plot: 5/5<br />Characters: 5/5<br />Ending: 4/5<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />With her home destroyed and Peeta missing, Katniss wakes up to find herself a resident of the fabled District 13. Unfortunately, the district isn't all its cracked up to be, and Katniss finds herself feeling more trapped than ever. Not to mention that those who escaped with her seem to be slowly losing their minds while she's being forced into the role of Mockingjay.<br /><br />Character Likability:<br />Katniss: Have I mentioned my love for the character, Katniss? I love this girl. She's strong, she marches to her own drum, she learns from her mistakes, she fights for what she believes in, she gets broken, as any real person would in her situation... but she allows herself to be mended.  In this book, Katniss grows and learns yet again. She's beginning to see the bigger plan, she's beginning to understand that some things never end, no matter how hard you fight... she's pushed to, and past, the point of breaking, and yet, she persists in trying to reach her goal. She is an amazing character... and what makes her so amazing is that she does all of these amazing things... and remains believable. She is filled with just as much questioning and doubt as any of us.<br />Peeta: Absent for a good portion of the book... and then returned... Peeta breaks my heart in this book... and then in pure Peeta fashion, he mends it again.<br />Haymitch: During this book, you're left wondering what, exactly, Haymitch's motives are.<br />Cinna: Despite not physically being in the book, Cinna is still a very motivating character. His Mockingjay outfit is a major reason Katniss takes up the mantle.<br />Prim and her Mother: Used, once again, mainly as motivators for Katniss... Prim is given slightly more voice, and acts more as a support for her sister, while the mother still remains mainly out of the picture.<br />President Snow: Pulling out all the stops in his wicked handbook, President Snow outdoes himself in the evil department.<br />Finnick: Watching Finnick with Annie is almost heartbreaking, and hearing his story IS heartbreaking. I was glad I got to hear what he had to say. It really drove home the need for this system to be destroyed.<br />Briggs: The quiet military man from District 13... he turns out to be possibly one of the truest friends Katniss ever has.<br />President Coin: The president of District 13, she's cold, calculating and not to be trusted.<br /><br />Quality of Writing:<br />Easy, quick flow. Engaging and un-put-downable. (oh yeah, I'm making up words now)<br /><br />Ending:<br />Bittersweet, believable.<br /><br />Plot:<br />District 12 has been destroyed, most of the people Katniss knew, dead. She, along with a few others, including her family and Gale, have been whisked off to District 13 to live underground. At this point, Katniss is starting to lose it. People she loved dearly are dead, most notably, Cinna, her designer from the Hunger Games. Peeta is in the hands of the Capitol and all Katniss can do is imagine the worst. Then, the video interviews with Peeta begin, and he's telling people to stop the rebellion... and Katniss knows she still has to save him... now from District 13 as well, who sees him as a traitor... and that's just the tip of the iceberg.<br />This plot really delves into the political motivations and the extent to which those in power will try to retain it. It's harsh, cruel and believable... which makes it all the more terrifying. The plot of this book is deep, twisted and worthy of more than just a casual read. The ideas being presented here really beg for, and deserve some deep thought on the part of the reader.<br /><br />Believability of World:<br />The most believable yet. It really points out that it's often hard to tell the difference between good and evil.<br /><br />Overall Grade: A
1439148953|4.0|You know the writing is good when you are up all hours of the night feverishly reading - reading about comings and goings about a quiet and unassuming young woman and nothing much happens.  This is the first book that I have read from this author, and there is something quite intangible and magical about his writing that made me want the book to not end - again, even though nothing much happens.  And what is really strange is that while I loved the writing, I found the main character Eilis to be infuriatingly passive and insipid.  She reminded me of flotsam that just gets carried this way and that with no expression of free will at all.  Things just happen to her and she lets them and just sort of goes along with it.  I cannot recall the last time when I liked the book so much and disliked the main character just as much.  I am still trying to figure out what the author was trying to do by having such an unlikeable and unsympathetic main character.  Can't wait to delve into his other books to compare to this one.
0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games<br />by Suzanne Collins<br /><br />Story Title: 3/5<br />Plot: 4/5<br />Characters: 4/5<br />Ending: 4/5<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />Every year at the reaping, two children from each district, one boy, one girl, are chosen to play in The Hunger Games. Forced to battle to the death, only one victor can remain... which is a real problem for Katniss since she owes her fellow District 12 pick, Peeta, an impossible debt.<br /><br />Character Likability:<br />Katniss: First off, love her name! Ok, much like Clary in The Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare, Katniss is another girl surrounded by hot guys who seem to love her... and yet, she just doesn't have time for them. I LOVE THIS. Often repulsed at the idea of even having children (because then they'd be forced to play in The Hunger Games too), Katniss often rebukes any claim of love as something she doesn't have time for, and doesn't understand. She's not a cold character though, she's just not a Mary Sue. She, of course, has worthwhile talents, but when it comes to jumping on board the \\"What's going on\\" train, Katniss is often the last to figure it out. She figures out her own things in her own time, but she's usually last in figuring out the more complicated stuff... which, for a girl who's only ever had to worry about keeping herself and her family alive, makes perfect sense.<br />Peeta: A lovely, wonderful baker's son, Peeta is stuck in the middle of his own love story... unfortunately, due to the circumstances, the leading lady isn't falling for it. Doesn't matter though, Peeta knows what he wants and will do anything to protect that.<br />Haymitch:A former District 12 Hunger Games winner, Haymitch is a perpetual drunk... and Katniss and Peeta's mentor. As soon as he realizes he has a pair of kids who might make it, he puts in a smooth, calculating effort to keep them alive, and even though he's repulsive and spends a good portion of the novel in a puddle of<br />Cinna: Katniss and Peeta's stylist for the game, he's cool, collected and not nearly as flamboyant as most of the Capitol. He's a major source of support for Katniss, and one of my favorite characters.<br />Prim and her Mother: Prim is Katniss' little sister and the reason Katniss ended up in the games... and the reason she fights so hard. Katniss' mother was worthless after her husband's death, but brought back by Katniss' strength.<br />President Snow: Supreme overlord! He's the big baddy in the Capitol, and the one calling all the shots when it comes to quelling rebel uprisings and dictating how things should be run in the districts.<br />Rue: A small, bird-like child from District 11 that reminds Katniss of Prim.<br /><br />Quality of Writing:<br />I found these books easy to read and quick as well. I've heard people complain that there were misplaced commas, but honestly, I remember at one point specifically noting how well placed the commas were.<br /><br />Ending:<br />Cliffhanger of doooooom. If you liked the first book, you'll be so thankful you're reading the series now that it's all out... because honestly, if I had to wait... I might go insane.<br /><br />Plot:<br />Katniss is living in an evil society where every year 24 children are forced to play The Hunger Games until only one is left living.<br />Truthfully, the plot of the first book seems to have taken heavy notes from a little Japanese thriller called Battle Royale by Koushun Takami. They are the same exact premise... as punishment for bad behavior, and to keep the peasants in-line, the ruling government forces kids to play in a game where they must battle to the death... leaving one victor who then becomes a national hero... and in both books, the main character, of course, is looking desperately for a way out of it, and a way to save someone they love at the same time. The plots really are eerily similar... and while I prefer Koushun Takami's method of announcing the dead in chapter titles, I prefer Collins' extension of this story, where there is the promise of further battle against the powers that be.<br /><br />Now, I've read quite a few reviews where people have found this plot unbelievable... but, you know what, this doesn't bother me. It's not a book about how the people allowed such a game to begin, it's a book where the game already exists. I found everything that happened within the context of the game to be entirely believable.<br /><br />And just so no one is confused, this IS a book about children killing children... in the most basic of terms. Beyond that, it's a very interesting, deep, questioning series that makes you really sit back and wonder about the level of betrayal and manipulation and calculation that must be going on around us all the time. It's a book that makes you question and then keeps you questioning.<br /><br />Believability of World:<br />I find this world believable. There have been many terrible things that have happened through history... instances where people where sheparded to death, knew it, and did nothing. It's not unbelievable that Katniss' world could exist.<br /><br />Overall Grade: Auite a few reviews where people have found this plot unbelievable... but, you know what, this doesn't bother me.

If you have not read The Hunger Games, this will reveal spoilers for the first book!<br /><br />Story Title: 4/5<br />Plot: 5/5<br />Characters: 4/5<br />Ending: 4/5<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />Katniss and Peeta, against all odds, have survived The Hunger Games, thanks to a bit of cleverness on Katniss' part. Unfortunately, the Capitol viewed her actions as an outright act of defiance, sparking political and social unrest among the districts. Then, to top it all off, it's time for the Quarter Quell, a special Hunger Game held every 25 years... and this years is set to be a doozy.<br /><br />Character Likability:<br />Katniss: Still amazingly dense when it comes to the boys in her life, Katniss has bigger things to worry about. I appreciate that the love stories that, in so many YA novels take over, are back-burner material in these books thanks to the fact that Katniss is able to recognize that some things are just bigger than her. This time around she's faced with more tough choices, more having to deal with pretending to love Peeta while he truly loves her, and more worrying about the future. She's finding out that there are repercussions to defying the powers that be.<br />Peeta: Still in love. Still hopelessly in love... and yet, when he disagrees with Katniss, he will make his voice heard. Always the voice of compassion, logic and reason... Peeta remains both true to himself and true to those he loves the most.<br />Haymitch: Less active in this novel during certain points, but more potent as a character... and as a father-type figure for Katniss.<br />Cinna: Still working as Katniss' stylist, he creates more beautiful works for her to parade around in... unfortunately, this time he might have gone one step too far.<br />Prim and her Mother: Living in the Victor's Village with Katniss, these two remain to be her main motivators. To protect her family is the most important thing to Katniss... and her family, in return, offers her the support she needs, when they can.<br />President Snow: Made even more villianous this time around... he exposes himself as a truly frightening human being and does things that are beyond unforgivable... as if the Games weren't enough.<br />Finnick: A District 4 Tribute winner... sexy, smooth, absolutely hilarious.

0307272702|5.0|This is definitely the very best NON-Diet book I've come across that has helped me loose weight. Gary Taubes actually explains how fat accumulates on the body. And guess what? It has nothing to do with how much we eat or how much we exercise! You could have knocked me over with a whisper. It really ticks me off that doctors ignore these tests!!!    Not only does Taubes prove that the \\"excess calories in/not enuf calories burned\\" theory is invalid by citing test study after test study all the way back from the early 1900's, but he tells WHY overeating and lack of exercise has nothing to do with being overweight!     He doesn't advocate either one, by the way - neither are good for your body, your heart, etc - but he explains very clearly, with all the test studies to back it up, that neither will bring about permanent weight loss. Not only that, but often exercise make one hungrier. And if you're cutting back on calories at the same time, you often feel deprived and starved, even weak and shakey or at the minimum very uncomfortable! And you are not likely to make this a life-long venture!     He has compiled very compelling evidence of exactly what we CAN do about it and STILL loose weight...Comfortably. Using this concept I have effortlessly lost 5 lbs in 2 1/2 weeks. Not water weight either! I never felt hungry, or deprived, never felt like reaching for a snack and I have oodles of energy. My problem is now...It's Christmastime.     Definitely a book to learn from. I like to know the WHY of a thing so I can really understand why I'm actually doing it. This book provides the answer to my questions.
B003CFB2F2|5.0|I love Sia.  I become a fan after seeing a DirectTV concert series featuring her music.  Just an absolutely glorious voice and way with a song.  This CD was a must-buy for my collection.
B004AKCMD4|2.0|I was very disappointed.  I read all 15 books.  The movie has distorted the characters and plot.  I would have prefered a closer interpretation of story and personalities. The animation was good and if you have not read the books I suppose most audiances would enjoy the movie. (I agree that the age group should be 9 and over.
B000HBKCDC|2.0|I was a little dissappointed in the CD.  I love SM but this left me unmoved and I gave it away.  I was surprised myself that disliked it so much.  The music was just so bland and lifeless. So unlike her other albums.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|I have to admit I was one of those people who didn't expect much from Ben Affleck.   I was wrong.   In \\"The Town,\\" Affleck reaffirms the values of classic Hollywood genre pictures even as he demonstrates his mastery of the craft.   It's great to experience the arrival of a director capable of continuing the tradition of Walsh, Aldrich, Eastwood, et al!   And \\"The Town\\" is a great movie experience.    I saw it tonight at a screening at Warner Bros, where the security people had misdirected half the invited audience to the wrong screening room.  So, after watching the fantastic first 15 minutes, the lights came back up and we were asked if we minded if they started the movie over for latecomers.   Nobody objected.      Afterwards,  I took a walk in the rain down the old backlot streets where Edward G. Robinson,  Humphrey Bogart, and George Raft used to shoot 'em up.   All I could think was that somewhere above the rain clouds the old Warner Bros tough guys were smiling!    Bear in mind, I never thought I'd be such a fan of Ben Affleck.   For me, \\"Good Will Hunting\\" is to independent film what Sarah Palin is to the brain.   But if the success of GWH gives us a director of Affleck's stature (and an actor as good as Matt Damon has become), then all is forgiven!
B0036OS3Q0|2.0|I bought these a half size larger than I normally wear, but found they were exactly the size I wear, so I am not able to wear thicker socks for colder weather. The rubber portion cuts a little bit across the arch bridge (top of the foot) and around the inner ankle bone, so I am not able to wear these boots for long periods of time. They are v-e-r-y light, so that is a pleasant surprise. I am returning this pair, due to fit and cutting. I recommend ordering one full size larger than your shoe size.
0452295548|5.0|Neuroanatomist Jill Bolte-Taylor takes us into the fascinating world of left-brain, right-brain hemispheres of the brain in a very user-friendly, lay-person accessible way. Not only is this a testimony of her experience recovering from a stroke, it is also provides insight into our tendency towards left-brain dominance in Western culture and where this left-brain dominance falls short in drawing us into relationship with ourselves, with others, and with the Divine. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has interests in the relationship between science, psychology and spirituality.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Very entertaining!  Finally, a smart teen movie with a smart, funny heroine. This movie also teaches a valuable lesson while being charming and funny. Loved it!
0525423273|5.0|If you like romance, real romance that sweeps you and leaves you breathless, then Anna and the Frech Kiss is for you. There's no instant I-Love-You-More-Than-Life-Itself, but rather a relationship that has attraction and slowly builds as the characters discover more about each other, and more importantly, themselves.    This book felt fresh and realistic, and yet was funny and endearing.     All around a wonderful book!    Read it!!
0765328321|5.0|Great back story for the first halo game. This book does a great job at describing how the spartan came to be.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|I have to say that I think this pack is wonderful. Not only the blu ray but having the dvds too. In regards to the packaging I have to say I like it a lot. Having been in packaging for 16years it really is one of the nicer packs I have seen. It seems that other opinions are saying there is not enough protection for the disc.  Actually that is not the case. The foam they used is very good packaging foam , not cheap. The foam they used will not scratch the disc and will protect them from being  scratched. Disney and Pixar you did a great job. Love Andi's toy box too!!!
0316067938|1.0|This was NOT good.  And i am rooting for neither Edward nor Jacob, so this review is not biased.    I read Twilight when I was in 8th grade and thought it was amazing.  I read New Moon and Eclipse and they were... good.  By the time Breaking Dawn came out, I didn't feel like reading it. By this time I was 10th grade.    I kinda enjoyed the part that was in Jacob's point of view, but that was it. I dislike Bella's character so much it isn't funny. After Jacob's point of view ended, I was forcing myself to continue because it got boring. Eventually I couldn't take it anymore, and just stopped. It was enough to just go on the internet and find out how it ended. I have no desire to actually finish the book, and I now plan to give away all 4 twilight novels to make space on my bookshelf for better books.
B003YLK2RI|5.0|I think SlipKnot has grown a lot over the years, even crazier to think is they have grown with me (I was in high school when they first started, and a lot of them were teenagers themselves at the time) and the evolution has been amazing.<br /><br />Through the years, many bands will come and go, most I wont like, a select few I'll enjoy for their uniqueness. SlipKnot has always been unique, what with Corey's amazing ability to go guttural and then actually sing all in the same song, Mickey's amazing Guitar skills, Joey's ability to godsmack you with Drum beats that rival the classic drummers (imo), and Paul's great talent for bass. Even clown, who seemingly does very little, adds atmosphere to songs with his way of drumming and beating beer kegs that has still not gotten old when its used in their stuff, and Sid- while more downplayed in newer songs- is a really good DJ.<br /><br />There is a uniqueness to SlipKnot that is unmatched, but ever evolving. Like any good band, they have changed over the years, and while some cant acclimate to the change, and debates can be made, even that itself is a testament to the power of SlipKnot.<br /><br />To me, watching the Download 2009 festival (having heard everything made public for the knot and a life long maggot) I feel this is the pinnacle of SlipKnot's work. Never has Corey seemed so on top of his game. While Corey is amazing, anyone that has seen a lot of live stuff from SlipKnot can tell you he has had a tendency to be less capable of keeping up with the songs in the past (which never hurt the concerts in my opinion) but in this show Corey showed a much more matured stage presence than ever before. I could speculate as to why, and I am glad he's taking better care of himself which may be a factor in his capabilities, but all that matters is this concert feels to me like one of the best things SlipKnot has ever done.<br /><br />This DVD is great, and comes with all special features you'd maybe want, the concert is mind blowing (even better then the last DVD concert they released), and it comes with some newer videos for you to enjoy.<br /><br />All in all, this is a SlipKnot fan must have.<br />R.I.P. Paul (2). From a big fan, you will be missed and all love goes to your family and those you've left behind.last DVD concert they released), and it comes with some newer videos for you to enjoy.    All in all, this is a SlipKnot fan must have.   R.I.P. Paul (2). From a big fan, you will be missed and all love goes to your family and those you've left behind.
B0041KKYDI|4.0|I saw this movie yesterday and have to say that it is one of the great movies of the year.  This is no surprise when you learn that Danny Boyle was the Director and Producer as Slumdog Millionaire was great as well.  This is the story as many folks know about a man who was (is) an avid hiker and mountaineer and is out one day climbing and hiking and gets trapped by a boulder. The only way to get out ended up being to saw his arm off and walk out.  The movie is not for anyone who is squeamish but I have to say that even those parts were done in a realistic but sensitive way.  The fact that he was able to survive and get out and make it back and even more importantly go on with his life as a climber and mountaineer is amazing.  I think it is hard to say \\"if he can do it I can do it\\" because to be honest I hardly know anyone who truly can say they can do this.  Who really do you know who can saw off their own arm with a pocketknife?  But the movie itself was great, likely will win some awards, and I highly recommend it.
B003L77GRO|3.0|I am a huge Dexter fan and have really enjoyed the first 4 seasons of this show. I also purchased these seasons on dvd. I will NOT be adding season 5 to my collection. If you want to know why please read the other review titled Disappointing and flat. The person that wrote that review was spot on with what he said about the show.
B0041G683W|3.0|I recently purchased this on the UK Amazon site and only paid approx. $27 (after conversion from pounds).  The blu-ray DVD is not region-coded and can be played on US players & tvs(unlike the regular DVD version coded only region 2 on the UK site).
B000O8OTNC|1.0|This knife sharpener might be a step up from a flat rock if you were stranded somewhere; otherwise, it's pretty much a waste.  When I used this on my knives it dulled them quite a bit. I guess what this knife sharpener calls sharp isn't as sharp as what I can do with a wet stone in half the time. If you're looking for a pull through knife sharpener, you should check out the meyerco sharpen it, it made my knives much sharper than what this one did.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|I put this order in for Season 6, and I got it just in time! I love Grey's Anatomy, I have all seasons that's on DVD, and I LOVE IT! Oh, did I mention how much I love Grey's Anatomy! IT came on-time and that is all. This season is filled with surprises, and it has an all time high of wit from Chrisina Yang and Meredith Gray! Sad that Izzy didn't die, and George did, but whatever. I LOVE ALL CHARACTERS, no matter how wrong Izzy was for leaving Alex without saying a word then showing up out of no where. LOL Thanks AMAZON!

0141442468|3.0|This is a review for the Penguin Classics hardcover edition of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", ISBN: 0141442468.  Amazon.com, despite its general excellence, fails to take into account the bibliophile for whom the quality of the edition he determines to purchase matters, so, this is not a review for the intellectual content of the volume I have recently bought, but, rather, a review of the quality of this particular volume's production.<br /><br />I had hoped, that Penguin had finally decided to market its considerable store of intellectual wealth to those who desire a book of some distinction, to those who still admire the craftsmanship of a finely wrought tome.  Largely, in this edition (and in those others, similar to it) they have succeeded.  The cloth covers of these editions are attractively designed; the typesetting modern, attractive, and readable; the cloth marker a thoughtful edition.  However--and this is a thing unabidable--the binding is glued and does not have signatures.  Sewn signatures are a sign that some care has been taken to ensure the longevity of a book.  The crude, merely glued together pages make this volume little better than some cheap paperback in deceiving, meretricious garb.  I will not again be purchasing a book from this line, and would advise anyone else to avoid doing the same.
B0042U94UQ|2.0|Turn off your brain and the graphics deserve 2 stars. Maybe there's a young adolescent market that would find it funny.
1577314808|5.0|This is an excellent book which everyone should read. Eckhart Tolle the author speaks about just living in the now! To do this will eventually brings about an inner transformation as the presence makes itself known!
030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferris's book; \\"The 4-Hour Body\\" has barely been out a week but I've already read all the fitness and diet parts (It covers much more). Tim's sections on diet and fitness is much more condensed (about 90 pages altogether), but it still is packed with relevant information and data to back it up.    I went into a more thorough comparison of the diet/weight loss portions of the book on my blog, genkigeek.com - which was created in huge credit to what I learned in this book. Taking his research as example and building on what I've already discovered for myself, I'm exploring the right balance for myself as a busy active female putting his theories and recommendations to the test.    I loved 4 hour workweek and have equally enjoyed 4HB. Highly recommended and have shared with all my friends/family.
B00376ZG0I|5.0|I really like this turntable. I have transferred my 1959 Bo Diddley   Album \\"Have Guitar Will Travel\\" to MP3.  Sounds Great.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|I recently had the immense pleasure of catching a showing of Tron: Legacy this past weekend. I enjoyed the film a lot especially Daft Punk's score. I am a bit disappointed that American version of the soundtrack is missing several tracks and a few on the cd have been edited to just a couple of minutes.  I definitely plan on acquiring the 2 cd version of the soundtrack at some point. I would like to hear it as a whole. Now that I got my minor quibbles with the album out of the way, the music in general really blew me away. I liked that the guys in Daft Punk wanted to go beyond what they are known for in dance music. While many music critics were disappointed that the guys would experiment in more orchestral sounds, I thought the blend of classical, ambient, and techno really elevated the film. Of course the guys didn't totally ditched their dance roots. \\"Derezzed\\" was nothing short of classic Daft Punk. I totally dug \\"Tron Legacy\\" which combined the haunting melodies of the film's theme song with groovy dance beats. I really enjoyed every single track on the album. I was not disappointed in any of the songs. Tron Legacy is definitely a soundtrack worth owning.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Great film, great transfer.  This film has never looked better outside of the cinemas than on blu ray.  Highly suggested.
0007398557|5.0|Book took some time to arrive (it was shipped from the UK) but it was worth the wait. Great book, mint condition.
158270208X|4.0|Bought this book after reading The Secret. Sturdy book, much like a journal or a hard cover moleskin journal. Two pages for each entry, one to write what you are grateful for having, the other for writing about what you are asking for. I like the book because it serves a specific purpose and reminds me each morning to write in it, but if you can't justify spending that much on a journal, any notepad could serve the same purpose.
1401310400|4.0|I watch the show (Castle) as often as time permits. After I got into the book (about 2 chapters) I started visualizing the characters. After that it just took off. Can't wait to get the next book and hope there will be more to follow.
B004BA5HNU|2.0|I really enjoyed the Shifting Fog and the House at Riverton so I had high hopes for Kate Morton's latest offering. I had expectations of a dark gothic tale but this really seems interminable. I'm still only 30 per cent into it but I can't seem to find any connection with the characters. All this feeding chooks and riding bicycles and looking at pies in the oven. Pahleese! When I studied professional writing I remember my lecturer slashing through all my carefully crafted prose of people doing trivial stuff and gruffly saying 'You gotta get rid of this crap and move the story forwards!' Kate's editor (if there was one) should have done the same thing. I sense there must be some purpose in this story and perhaps there is a big ending but it sure is slow going at the moment. I will persist and hope for the best. I'll revisit this review if things improve.
030746363X|5.0|The element that makes this book unique and important to share is the fact that Tim is a courageous leader who doesn't take himself too seriously (even while doing some pretty serious science experiments on himself). Also, it should be noted that any guy who puts a chapter in his book about giving a woman an orgasm is a winner, especially in the way he describes it. He's completely candid about his experience, and seems to be able to address a lot of concerns a woman may have in a really clear and informative way. As Tim says when you start the book, it's not meant to be read front to back, you pick and choose what you care about, and try it out. I am doing one or two things at a time, and evaluating the results. This book is funny, educational, impressive, and most of all, a great model for leading others. If you're learning a lot from your own hobbies and life's work, why not share it? Tim Ferriss, if you're reading this...I hope to meet you one day!
0451228731|5.0|This novel was very well written. From beginning to end Daemon keeps you overzealous on what's to come next. Very easy read also. This book also opens your mind to the potential threat of technology in today's world. I definitely recommend this book with immense level of appraisal.
1439107955|5.0|Siddhartha Mukherjee, assistant professor of Medicine at Columbia University and staff physician at the CU/NYU Presbyterian Hospital, has written an epic history of Western medicine and its ultimate nemesis, the disorder of fundamental life processes we call cancer. Combining the tools of journalism, history, true crime, and memoir with a novelist's grasp of character and plot, a physician's compassion, and a scientist's perspective, Mukerjee delivers an utterly absorbing, credible, and deeply meaningful narrative that also benchmarks for future readers the art and science of oncology today.    Tracing the history of oncology from Hippocrates and Galen through the centuries to the beginning of small-molecule targeted therapy with the introduction of Gleevec for chronic myeloid leukemia, Mukherjee highlights legendary players including Andreas Vesalius; John Bennett; Gregor Mendel; Rudolf Virchow; Robert Koch; William Stewart Halsted; Pierre and Marie Curie; Oswald Avery; Lucy Wills; Sidney Farber; Mary Lasker; Emil Freireich and Emil Frei; Min Chiu Li; Thomas Hodgkin; Henry Kaplan; Donald Pinkel; Peyton Rous; Mary Cole; Gianni Bonadonna and Umberto Veronesi; Richard Doll and Bradford Hill; Bruce Ames; Baruch Blumberg; Marcus Conant and Paul Volberding; David Baltimore; Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus; Janet Rowley; Peter Nowell and David Hungerford; Robert Weinberg; Bert Vogelstein; Judah Folkman; Axel Ullrich, Dennis Slamon, Alex Matter, and Nick Lydon; Brian Druker, Charles Sawyers, Moshe Talpaz, and Hagop Kantarjian; and Francis Collins.    Mukherjee also delves into the work and motivations of more than twice this number of investigators, and quotes liberally from humanist writers, including Susan Sontag, William Carlos Williams, and Rose Kushner. Perhaps most important, much of the book details the experience of cancer patients, including those of the author.    Essential reading that is also most enjoyable.
0307454541|5.0|Wow. That's all I can really say about this book.  The first in the Millenium Trilogy, this book blew me away.  Stieg Larsson really knows what he is writing about.  I was skeptical about reading this book, because with all of the craze about it I felt like I would most likely be disappointed when I finished it.  However, this was definitely NOT the case.  I'm in love with Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander!
B004ASVS0E|5.0|I debated about getting this for a while.  Samples sounded just OK.  Fortunately I took the chance and after listing through probably ten times now I am very glad I took the chance. In my opinion this is the best new Christmas CD to come out in a long time.  Annie's voice is perfect for the songs.  I read a review from someone that said they should have known not to buy it based on the cover.  And maybe they are right.  Personally I like the cover, it has cool Victorian look about it which I think matches the songs on the album.  I could see Ole Frizywig dancing to Joseph Went A Walkin.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is quite thrilling.  It was in no way dull at any moment.  I recommend everyone to read this book!
1439107955|5.0|This is a lucid, penetrating, and brilliant presentation about the treatment of cancer from aniquity. As a cancer survivor myself, I found that it gave me an insight I hadn't had before. In my growing up years in Scotland, no one used the dark word \\"cancer.\\" It still seems difficult for some people to talk about it, let alone read about it.  This book makes it possible to read and understand in a most helpful and illuminating wat.
B003R0LBVW|2.0|This book never seemed to get to the point. I am usually pleased with anything Oprah recommends but this book was a total waste of money.
1592332803|4.0|I've had this book for a while, and have made many of the recipes.  While they always turn out ok, I do notice a common theme of the measurements being slightly off.  The pre-baking consistency always seems unusual.  I no longer really trust this book, for example, in a situation where I want to bring a new dessert to a friends house, or serve to people other than my immediate household.  If you find yourself in preparing a dessert for an event, I would recommend a test run of the recipe.<br /><br />For example - I most recently made the German Apple Cake - and what the author calls batter - was more like a glob of sticky biscuit dough. I had to add an extra 1/4 cup of liquid to make it into anything resembling batter, and even then it was rather thick and sticky.  I always wonder how my additions alter the outcome of the product, and how my consistency can be so off even after following the recipe exactly. Sometimes I wonder if she's actually made all of her recipes.<br /><br />None of the recipes have ever failed, but I guess thats because most often I ammend them.  Other than that - they always seem to turn out tasty.  This is a good book for simple, standard, comfort food desserts.
1439177783|3.0|Portia's story of her eating disorder is difficult to read. The pain she experienced and the obvious lack of self confidence is startling and for those of us old enough to remember her first appearance on Ally McBeal, it comes as quite a shock.     Despite Portia's story being tough to take in, this is a necessary one for many young women who seek to emulate the ever shrinking stars we see on our screens. And for that, Portia is to be commended. All too often we look at these women in glossy mags and wonder how they got to that stage. Portia explains how it could be possible in extreme detail.
B004BUIX2W|5.0|This cd is great. The first female MC to defend women and talk about more then sex, money, violence or how other women are hating bitches. Don't get me wrong she does talk about those things, but it doesn't take up the whole CD to do it. She also talks about how heartache, love and being a powerful women. She has one song \\"Save Me\\" where she talks about she was the bad guy in the relationship. Which women now a days often don't take in account that it could be they could be in the wrong in the relationship. Most females MC always blame the men. This is CD is refreshing new points of view and not to forget that her flow can stand up next to the big boys of RAP.
0763619612|5.0|I consider this a perfect book.  The story is simple, but deep.  Basically it says that for everything you hope to do, you have to start somewhere, you have to take a first step.  And you never know how far you might ultimately go.  The pictures are simply rendered, and well-edited.  I also like very much that the story features a female protagonist as there are far too few female protagonists in children's literature.  We happened upon this book at a local children's museum and my daughter remembered that her art teacher had read it to her class, and asked me to read it to her again.  I loved this book so much that we had to have it in our personal library.
B000001G5H|4.0|I was looking for a collection of Chopin Etudes and this CD was one of the more highly recommended. When it arrived I listened diligently. While the playing was \\"flawless\\" there seemed to be something missing. Yes, all the notes sounded right and the technique never seemed forced but none of the pieces grabbed me in any way. I was somewhat shocked and surprised. I listened again and same reaction. Thinking maybe I was just in a weird listening mood and must be missing something I put on Horowitz' rendition of Op 25 No 1 from \\"The Last Recording.\\" It was like listening to an entirely different piece filled with nuance and emotion. It was obvious at this point that I was not crazy and that while Pollini certainly renders a technically competent rendition of Chopin there just seems to be a huge emotional void. I just can't see myself constantly returning to this CD. It just has nothing to stand out and grab me. It is convenient as a reference for a piano student to hear the Etudes. For the joy of listening I will stick with Horowitz though.

0375842209|5.0|This is the first Amazon review I have written.  Very rarely have I felt so strongly about a book.  I finished it last night and instantly started reading it again.  The characters, plot, and intricacies of the narrator make this book compelling and unique.  I agree with what others have said... this is a book that adults can and SHOULD read.  I am an avid adult reader who reads 1-2 books per week, including all the new books on the NYT bestseller list that everyone calls \\"must reads.\\"  This.  is.  a.  must.  read.  Hands down the best book I've read all year.

055358894X|5.0|I am thoroughly impressed with Scott Lynch's debut novel, The Lies of Locke Lamora. The titular character is a thief, and the story follows him and his exploits in a fantasy city that may remind you somewhat of Venice. Locke and his gang seem like a urban fantasy version of Ocean's Eleven, wth their grand heists targeting the highest echelons of the city of Camorr's elite. The plot is solid and will engage you. My biggest caveat is to warn about the language: if you cringe at profanity, this book is not for you. The themes and language make this not suitable for a young adult audience. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and its followup, Red Seas Under Red Skies.

We are all in these bodies, and they are pretty complex.  This book won't solve all the riddles, or simplify things for you.  But just like reading a travel guide to a faraway place is not the same as experiencing it, but can give you tips of where to eat or stay, 4HB can give you ideas of things to try if you are interested in discovering (through experimentation and experience) some answers to questions you might have about your body.  I sound like a middle school health teacher.  I'm most of the way through the book and was a fan of Tim Ferriss before this book was coming out.  Reading it has sparked my imagination.  I'm pretty healthy, but I'd love to be stronger, faster, have a six-pack.  And now I feel like I'm on my way.  Here are some low-hanging fruit from the book:  1. An easy way to improve your diet is to take a picture with your cell phone of anything you are about to eat.  Makes you think a little bit first, and way easier than a food journal.  2. If you want to lose fat or gain muscle, take \\"before\\" pictures and measurements.  Good for measuring progress and for inspiration.    Read the book and TRY some stuff from it.  And take notes so you can see if it works.

B003UESJHO|5.0|Set in Lowell, Massachusetts, \\"The Fighter\\" is loosely based upon the story of two boxers: \\"Irish\\" Micky Ward played by Mark Wahlberg and his brother Dicky Eklund, played by  Christian Bale. The gritty blue-collar city of Lowell was the home of the famous writer, Jack Kerouac (1922 -- 1969).  I visited Lowell some years ago to see Kerouac Park and other related sites. I also remembered Micky Ward from the long nights some years ago when I watched boxing on television. Thus, I had to see this boxing movie which reminded me at the outset of a city and fighter I knew.<br /><br />I was surprised that the movie doesn't as much as mention Kerouac, but he had died nearly 20 years before Ward's boxing career. Otherwise, one of the attractions of the movie to me was the opportunity to revisit Lowell. It still has resemblances to the city Kerouac portrayed with its old row houses, bridges, bars, and working-class population of various origins. The city has a larger drug problem than it did in Kerouac's day. The atmospheric portrayal of Lowell was realistic.<br /><br />With its violence, brutality, skill, and sleaze, boxing and boxing movies are fascinating. Without falling into sentimentality, \\"The Fighter\\" captures rawness of the sport and tells a story of endurance, family, conflict, and love. For many viewers, Bale is the center of attention as the thin, tough-eyed and crude Eklund, a fighter in the late 1970s who had difficulties with the law and with addiction.  Eklund had been called \\"the pride of Lowell\\", a phrase I have also heard applied to Kerouac.  Eklund trains his younger brother and encourages him.  But he also tries to live vicariously through and to manipulate Micky. The mother of both fighters, Alice, played by Melissa Leo is also their manager.  She is cynical and controlling with her large family of daughters.  Micky, serious and hard working, has lost several fights and his career appears to be on the downs. But, when Eklund goes to jail, Micky gets a new manager who agrees to train his fighter on condition that Micky not work with Eklund or with Alice. Micky has a girlfriend, a redheaded bartender, Christine who sticks with him and encourages him.  The family dislikes her, and Micky's sisters call Christine a \\"skank\\".<br /><br />The movie shows Micky Ward making a boxer of himself under the tutelage of his new trainer. He wins hard fights with determination, as the several (simulated) boxing scenes portray a fighter who takes a good deal of punishment as well as administering it before landing a heavy and decisive punch. But Micky is dissatisfied that his family has been cut out of the picture. For all their faults and manipulations, the family is close and Micky relies on them.  A diplomat as well as a fighter, Micky, his manager, the family, and Christine work it out so that all have a share in Micky's career and success.<br /><br />\\"The Fighter\\" is an outstanding movie which speaks of the importance of love, redemption, family and effort in the violent world of boxing.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanees to train his fighter on condition that Micky not work with Eklund or with Alice.

030746363X|5.0|I was first impressed with Timothy Ferriss's Four-Hour Work Week book which truly did inspire me to quit my job, start my own business, and move into my own fantastic new home.  That being said, I knew that this book would be equally inspiring and straight-forward.  While I like to think that most self-help books say the same thing in a new way, this book offers really specific details about strategies to improve not only your body, but sleep, and sex.  I bought this book because after doing Weight Watcher since July and wanting to break through the last bit to reach my goal, I wanted to be reinspired with new techniques or ideas.  I love that truly, commitment to a specific regime is all that it takes rather than extensive, time, training, or supplements.  Working smarter versus harder is how I approach my life because of Tim's encouragement and irrefutable logic.      One bonus-two chapters on female orgasm with references to other books.  Brilliant!!

0786939532|5.0|If you love Drizzt, then this is where it all began.  I can't begin to tell you how great this book is, and what a joy it was to read!  I'm a fan of Harry Potter, and the plot of this book (of course it predates Harry Potter by a number of years) very much reminded me of the Harry Potter book, especially as Drizzt is going through the academy and doing what he thinks is right.  The characters were great, and really made me feel for Drizzt and his situation.  Prior to reading this book I had only read the Icewind Dale trilogy, so this was the next step for me in Salvatore's Drizzt novels.  They just keep getting better!  Can't wait to read the next one!

B0045ODPKY|2.0|you know guys, i was laughing through the whole movie...it seems like that this movie should have been made 20 years ago, when the russian theme was popular.. was there a good action? well...may be... BUT think about it:  1. how did this Orlov came in to the CIA building with the knife in his boot?  2. how did he escape from elevator where he was seen killing those agents?  3. nato officers entering the white house without fingerprints chesk?   4. 1 russian super-spy was able to trick secret service, cia, etc...really?   i can say even more, but i won't... overall - don't have great expectations, you'll find some suspense but it doesn't make sense afterwards.    P.S. as a russian native i think producers could have had real russian actors, like this orlov who is polish:)

030746363X|2.0|I'm a big fan of the Four Hour Work Week. Not only was it a great read, but it contained rather unique ideas that caused me to reevaluate how to run my business and also my life. I would go as far to say that it is one of the last decade's seminal pieces of business literature that all serious business people should read.     With that in mind, it's unfortunate that The Four Hour Body is such a big let down. First, it's not really a book, but rather a series of independent chapters that the author says can be read independently. As such, the book doesn't really flow, and there's no real end goal. Second, I really can't tell who the target audience is, but a lot of the book appears to be geared towards people with very serious athletic ambitions. Want to run marathons, fix previous injuries with plasma injections, or lift more than 3x your weight? Sure, you'll get something out of the book. But the legions of normal people who bought the Four Hour Work Week probably won't.     Another problem I have is that the majority of the links that the author uses in the book appear to be affiliate links where the author makes money when someone purchases an item. Given that I can't seem to find any disclaimer that this is the case, I personally feel like it undercuts the serious message in some of the chapters, especially with the chapter on how to lose weight. How does one know that those supplements aren't being recommended simply to make money off of them? It's a conflict of interest, and it undercuts the message.     The author also has spent a lot of time doing medical experiments on himself, the results of which are used to reinforce some of the ideas in the book. Unfortunately, a experiment with one person is completely useless statistically. All it shows are the results for the author, and nothing else can be inferred from their presentation. In fact, there's one series of data that the author presents, but then spends far more time discussing all the problems with howhe did the experiment than the time spent discussing the actual results. If the experiment was so bad, why not revise the methodology, or exclude it completely? It just seems hastily put together.     I was expecting a lot more from this book based on the marketing, the revolutionary ideas in The Four Hour Work Week, and some of the entries on the author's blog. But this book was one of the first books in a long time I started skimming near the end, simply because I was no longer interested in it.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|We waited for this version of the movie so I would not purchase the movie twice.  The quality of the movie is excellent, looks and sounds great.  The added footage adds some to the movie, more on the back story of the main character.  Have not had a chance to watch all the extras, because there is hours and hours of extras.  One thing I did like is the movie has a clean language track, which I wish all movies came with.  If you only want to purchase this movie once get this version.  You get 3 versions of the movie on blu-ray, plus tons of extra stuff.
030745455X|3.0|So, we meet again with our heroine, Lisbeth Salander. After 'stealing' Wennerstrom's money and feeling heartbroken, she decided to leave Sweden and travels around the world. She had her own adventure when she was in Granada; meanwhile Blomkvist - who keep trying to contact Salander - got involved with an investigation of sex-trafficking along with his colleagues in Millennium. When Salander returned to Sweden, she discovered that the investigation linked to her past. In the middle of investigation, brutal murders occurs and Salander was accused as the culprit. Blomkvist was trying to prove her innocence and captures the real culprit and got tangled in the whole mess.<br /><br />Somehow most of second books in trilogy weren't as good as the first book. Mostly because they served as milestone for the third book that supposed to be the best of the series. The same thing applies to this book; it didn't gives us surprises like the first book, though it brought us to know more about Lisbeth.<br /><br />I gave this 3 stars, a star lower than the first book. The reason is simple, Lisbeth - although still awesome - not as different as she was in first book. She's gone soft and a bit girly - concern about her appearance. And the 1/3 first part of the book was basically useless, imo. Especially the part when Salander out of Sweden because it didn't linked with the main focus of the story. Either Larsson using it as a foundation for the 3rd book or he running out of idea what Salander should do why Blomkvist busy with Millennium and looking for her. The strong point on this book was that we get an information about Salander's dark past and why as an adult she still needs guardian.

0307454541|4.0|I finally get my hand on this popular first installment of Millenium trilogy by Stieg Larsson. At first I'm a bit skeptical; I grew up reading various detective series and for me the old school detective stories are much better than the recent ones. But this novel hook me right away the moment I was introduced to Lisbeth. She's a very interesting and original character, unlike most of female main character in stories, she's a flat chest child-like anti-hero who diagnosed as mentally unstable and needs guardian even though she's an adult. Blomkvist on the other hand, doesn't impress me that much. For me he's just like any other main character in most stories: attractive, smart, morally just, and went against the powerful capitalist company.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Blomkvist who, after beaten in court by the powerful capitalist company, hired by another rich capitalist, Henrik Vanger, as investigator to solve a 36 years old mystery. His job was to reveal the mystery behind Harriet Vanger, Henrik's favorite nephew, disappearance and the dark secrets that hidden within the family. According to Henrik, one the members of Vanger family was involved in the incident. This mystery has became an obsession for Henrik and he wish to find out the truth before he died. Lisbeth on the other hand, is a personal investigator who was hired by Vanger to investigate Blomkvist earlier, until Blomkvist founds out about it and offers her to work with him in solving the mystery.<br /><br />It's necessary to mention that some of the crimes in book are gruesome, disgusting, and sick. For those who can't stand the description of brutal crime, perhaps should stay away from it. But lots of other crime series also provide the similar gruesome killing/torture methods so actually it wasn't new or surprising at all.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I have every season of Supernatural and this one is fabulous. It seems like it just gets better and better.The Winchester boys never fail to entertain.

B0032FPVKE|5.0|At first, I wasn't super-thrilled with this bag.  I bought it to use with my Canon M31 camcorder, but felt it was too small when it first arrived.  It is a lot smaller-looking than in the picture!!  Its size has more in common with a water bottle carrier than the knapsack you probably have in your head when you look at Amazon's pic.  Yet, despite or possibly because of its diminutive dimensions, it's grown on me.  There's obviously a trade-off between size and convenience; sure, you can get a bigger bag, but then you have to lug it around.  In fact, I did subsequently buy a larger bag, but I rarely use it.  I'm not a \\"photographer\\" and I don't want to lug a gear bag around.  I just want to go do stuff and have my camcorder with me.  For that kind of usage, the Amazon bag is perfect.  I stuff this little bag with the M31 camcorder with extended battery (extends about 1\\" past the end of the camcorder), its remote control, an external mic, and the add-on mini-shoe light.  It's a bit of a tight fit, all told, but it's workable. The thing is, you can sling this bag over your shoulder or affix it to your belt, and it doesn't get in the way at all, which is a huuuuge convenience.  I recommend trying this one out before going to a larger bag, if convenience is an issue to you as it was to me.  It's very well made - nice materials, soft interior, quality stitching, comfortable strap - 5 stars.

B0021L8V0W|5.0|Move over James Bond!  Stand aside Jason Bourne! Welcome Evelyn Salt.<br /><br />If there is one formula in Hollywood that seems to work, that is having actress Angelina Jolie as your action star. The actress has appeared in several action-based films such as the \\"Tomb Raider\\" films, \\"Wanted\\", \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\" and her films continue to be box office hits but her role as Evelyn Salt may just be what Hollywood has been wanting and needing, a femme fatale, a spy who literally kicks ass!  And there is no doubt about it, Evelyn Salt kicks ass and the potential of her character is fantastic.<br /><br />In 2010, Jolie's spy thriller \\"SALT\\" became another dominating hit film in the box office for the actresss raking in over $293 million worldwide and now the Blu-ray and DVD release of \\"SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition\\" will be released courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on December 21st.  And for those who love the film, will enjoy more of Evelyn Salt as you get three different versions of the film.<br /><br />\\"SALT\\" is directed by Phillip Noyce (\\"The Patriot Games\\", \\"Clear and Present Danger\\", \\"The Bone Collector\\") and features a screenplay by Kurt Wimmer (\\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\", \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\", \\"Ultraviolet\\"), music by James Newton Howard (\\"The Dark Knight\\", \\"The Sixth Sense\\", \\"The Fugitive\\") and cinematography by Robert Elswith (\\"Duplicity\\", \\"There Will Be Blood\\", \\"Michael Clayton\\" and \\"Boogie Nights\\").<br /><br />\\"SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition\\" comes with three different versions of the film.  While there will be two DVD releases of the film, one with the original theatrical edition and the other with a director's cut and extended edition.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release of \\"SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition\\", It is important to note that there are three different versions of the film.  The original theatrical edition and the extended edition are literally two different films in which the story of both films tend to go on different paths right after Evelyn meets up with Orlov.<br /><br />The director's cut has a few slight modifications to the original theatrical edition with a voice over that changes the ending of the original theatrical version of the film.  So, in essence, each of the three versions of \\"SALT\\" have a different ending.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"SALT\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The picture quality of \\"SALT\\" is absolutely fantastic.  \\"SALT\\" is a film that looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray.  The colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep and plenty of detail galore.  The cinematography by Robert Elswit combined with the visual effects really make \\"SALT\\" look realistic.  From the scenes on the White House lawn to the visual effects to make New York look lively from high above to the detail of Angelina Jolie's hair and her teary eyes.<br /><br />I didn't detect any blurriness, compression artifacts, banding...no visual blemishes at all.  \\"SALT\\" looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"SALT\\" is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and an English - Audio Description Track Dolby Surround English Stereo.  Because this is an action film, you can expect a solid lossless 5.1 DTS-HD soundtrack.  From crowd ambiance, glass shattering, cars crashing into each other, bullets hitting metal,  bullets zipping to trains on the tracks and many instances of things blowing up, there is a good amount of sound being diverted to the surround channels and just enough LFE that makes \\"SALT\\" really envelop the soundscape in your viewing area.<br /><br />There is not one scene that I can say this is where the best sound is because these action sequences are so frequent and numerous that you can expect an active soundtrack throughout the film.<br /><br />Dialogue is crystal clear, as with the music soundtrack coming from the front and center channels.  \\"SALT\\" features a wonderful lossless soundtrack that compliments its wonderful picture quality.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"SALT\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Added Footage Marker - A marker that is activated during the viewing of the film and points out the differences between the unrated director's cut and unrated extended cut as compared to the theatrical version of the film.<br />  * movieIQ - If you are watching \\"SALT\\" on a Blu-ray 2.0 player connected to the Internet, you can pull up cast information and other information about the film.<br />  * Spy Cam: Picture-in-Picture - While watching \\"SALT\\", you get a picture-in-picture sequence in which the filmmaker, producer or talent talk about the various scenes of the film and you get to see the behind-the-scenes making of various scenes from \\"SALT\\".<br />  * The Ultimate Female Action Hero - (8:04) Director Phillip Noyce, producers and cast talk about how Angelina Jolie is an awesome actress who is willing to take on fearless role.  Angelina Jolie talks about how she wanted to be a Bond/Bourne that happens to be female, while not playing a female action star.  And how a lot of the stunts were done by Angelina Jolie.<br />  * The Real Agents - (12:32) Real agents talk about their work done during the cold war.  Former CIA and KGB agents discuss their secret lives that they lived.<br />  * Spy Disguise: The Looks of Evelyn Salt - (5:26) Angelina Jolie and Sarah Edwards (costume designer), Colin G. Jamison (hair stylist) talk about the various disguises that Angelina Jolie uses throughout the film.<br />  * The Modern Master of the Political Thriller: Phillip Noyce - (9:15) Director Phillip Noyce (\\"The Patriot Games\\", \\"Clear and Present Danger\\" and \\"The Bone Collector\\") talks about working on a film that deals with fear.  The director cast talk about a film based on the Cold War and the intrigue of spy stories.<br />  * False Identity: Creating A New Reality - (7:14) A feature on the visual effects of the film, especially what was needed to recreate the White House, the building and elevator scenes and creating the effect of a busy city street and more.<br />  * \\"The Treatment\\" Radio Interview with Phillip Noyce - (27:12) KCRW host Elvis Mitchell interviews Director Phillip Noyce for \\"The Treatment\\" radio show. Noyce talks about his intrigue of spies, the real story about the Russian spies that were caught in America,<br />  * SALT: Declassified - (29:45) A featurette on the making of the film.  Director Phillip Noyce talks about working with Angelina Jolie and his intrigue of reading the script.  Angelina Jolie talks about how the film was originally created for a man and more and how it departs from the original story.  The cast talk about their characters and more.  Note: Do not watch this featurette before watching the movie as there are many spoilers.<br />  * Filmmakers' Commentary - Audio commentary by Director Phillip Noyce who talks about his father who was an Australian spy.  Noyce also talks about his love for creating a spy film and how the earlier script was much different than the finished film and how it was originally crafted for a male character.  Joey Rand (music editor) gives his commentary about the music of the film.<br />  * Unrated Filmmakers' Commentary - The same commentary as the one above but includes commentary for the unrated director's cut of the film.<br />  * Unrated Extended Filmmakers' Commentary - The same commentary as the one above but includes commentary for the unrated extended cut of the film.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />A pulse-pounding, spy thriller with twists and turns from beginning to end, Angelina Jolie absolutely embodies the new line of action hero stars like Bond and Bourne.  \\"SALT\\" was an awesome film and on Blu-ray, it's even better because you get three versions of the film.<br /><br />But there is so much that I loved about the film.  For one, it was great to see a female heroine (or is she a villain?) and Angelina Jolie did a magnificentjob!  According to director Phillip Noyce, Jolie wanted a Bond-like character and simply, the character of Evelyn Salt fit perfectly.  Also, a wonderful job by actors Liev Schreiber, Chiewetel Ejiofor and Daniel Olbrychski.  But it's hard to talk about these characters without spoiling the film, also its even more difficult to even talk about the original theatrical version of the film now that the Blu-ray release has these different versions.  And dare I say, the director's cut and the very different extended version were much better than the original.<br /><br />So, I'm not going to even bother discussing what I liked about the original film as this is one of those rare moments for a Blu-ray review where the original theatrical edition may not mean as much as you may have a liking towards the other two versions of the films.  I have to admit that when I watched \\"SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition\\", I figured that this release would have wonderful PQ and AQ, especially since it was an intense spy thriller with so many action scenes, that was a given.  But I was not expecting a film that would literally feature a different second half and become a whole new different story.  It was wonderfully done and to be truthful, I kind of wished that the extended version was the original theatrical version.  But still both this and the director's cut of the film were well-done and a major improvement over the original.<br /><br />According to director Philip Noyce, the change of endings was the filmmaker trying to keep the focus of who is the ultimate villain to one character than the other.  He enjoyed both versions, I enjoyed both versions and I have no doubt that the viewers will too. Unlike other films which have various versions included on a Blu-ray disc. typically they don't exactly add much to the film but in the case of \\"SALT\\", these three different versions of the film included are quite substantial.  But for me, the extended version literally ends with a bang and has a memorable shot of Evelyn Salt.  A shame the extended version was not used for the theatrical version as it would have been a classic shot.<br /><br />And just when you think you have watched all three films and that you are done, there is somewhat of a fourth way to watch the film in which you can watch the film but have a picture-in-picture segment on the making of \\"SALT\\". You also get audio commentary for each of the three films.<br /><br />Granted, it's the same commentary but with additional commentary supporting those differing scenes or added footage.  You also get a good amount of special features, especially an interesting featurette by former spies from the CIA and KGB who talk about how life really was for a spy plus other featurettes such as radio interview, visual effects making of, disguises of Evelyn Salt and more.  And last, for the videophiles and audiophiles, \\"SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition\\" is fantastic!  Awesome PQ and AQ to literally round out this magnificent Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoyed \\"SALT\\", you're going to love \\"SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition\\".  Such a refreshing character and I am hoping for a sequel!<br /><br />Highly recommended!nt\\" Radio Interview with Phillip Noyce - (27:12) KCRW host Elvis Mitchell interviews Director Phillip Noyce for \\"The Treatment\\" radio show. Noyce talks about his intrigue of spies, the real story about the Russian spies that were caught in America,      * SALT: Declassified - (29:45) A featurette on the making of the film.  Director Phillip Noyce talks about working with Angelina Jolie and his intrigue of reading the script.  Angelina Jolie talks about how the film was originally created for a man and more and how it departs from the original story.  The cast talk about their characters and more.  Note: Do not watch this featurette before watching the movie as there are many spoilers.      * Filmmakers' Commentary - Audio commentary by Director Phillip Noyce who talks about his father who was an Australian spy.  Noyce also talks about his love for creating a spy film and how the earlier script was much different than the finished film and how it was originally crafted for a male character.  Joey Rand (music editor) gives his commentary about the music of the film.      * Unrated Filmmakers' Commentary - The same commentary as the one above but includes commentary for the unrated director's cut of the film.      * Unrated Extended Filmmakers' Commentary - The same commentary as the one above but includes commentary for the unrated extended cut of the film.    JUDGMENT CALL:    A pulse-pounding, spy thriller with twists and turns from beginning to end, Angelina Jolie absolutely embodies the new line of action hero stars like Bond and Bourne.  \\"SALT\\" was an awesome film and on Blu-ray, it's even better because you get three versions of the film.

B0042AEOG0|4.0|When it comes to Christmas music, I tend to gravitate towards the traditional or jazzier sounds of the season. But there is a big part of me that absolutely adores pop music, and Mariah Carey's Christmas music ranks high on that list. Her first Christmas album, Merry Christmas, became an instant classic and has received annual play from me since I became a fan of her music in the `90s. Aside from the occasional single, I'm not a huge fan of the predominantly R&B sound she's favored for the last few albums. But Merry Christmas II You is the perfect \\"bridge\\" project, a great companion album to her first Christmas release. It's full of classic Christmas carols given the Mariah Carey treatment and newly-penned songs sure to become favorites that will rank with \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\" and \\"Jesus Born On This Day\\" as modern holiday classics. The album opens with a 23-second pure musical \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\" intro that perfectly segues into Mariah's latest single \\"Oh Santa!,\\" clearly an attempt to capture lightning in a bottle twice and repeat the success of \\"All I Want.\\" And I have to say, for me it works - it's addictive, catchy, and fun - pure pop magic like only Mariah can produce. This upbeat opener is followed by a succession of beautifully produced, laid-back carols and ballads, perfect for relaxing with a cup of cocoa in front of the fire. \\"Christmas Time Is In the Air Again\\" has a wonderful jazz feel to the arrangement, and medleys like \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem/Little Drummer Boy\\" prove Mariah is as adept at wrapping her multi-octave vocal range around carols as she is slinky romantic ballads. One of the stand-out traditional tracks is \\"O Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujah Chorus\\" featuring Mariah's mother Patricia Carey, an opera vocalist who was a huge influence on her daughter's vocal stylings. I absolutely loved hearing them sing together, the arrangement and vocals all work together to make their collaboration the crown jewel of the album. My personal favorite is the new song \\"One Child,\\" a gorgeous retelling of the Nativity story with the reverential feel of a hymn and a wonderful showcase for Carey's vocals. Other favorites include a funky, upbeat version of \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" and perhaps most surprising of all, a fantastic reimagining of \\"Charlie Brown Christmas.\\" It wouldn't be Christmas for Carey's fans without \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You,\\" and Mariah delivers again with an \\"extra festive\\" mix of her classic pop gem. Finally, the album closes most appropriately with \\"Auld Lang Syne,\\" that starts off traditionally and then transitions into a fantastic dance mix, closing the album on a festive high note. Filled with gorgeous arrangements, catchy pop numbers, and Mariah's signature vocal acrobatics, Merry Christmas II You is pure pop magic, sure to be enjoyed by Carey's fans for years to come..

B004529NKM|4.0|In 2006, the dance/romance film \\"Step Up\\" was born and it was a box office success with a budget of $12 million, \\"Step Up\\" would bring in $114 million worldwide.<br /><br />So, with the financial success of the first film, it was not surprising that a sequel  in 2008 titled \\"Step Up 2: The Streets\\" would be made and directing the film would be dancer and filmmaker John Chu (\\"Silent Beats\\", \\"When the Kids Are Away\\", \\"Justin Bieber: Never Say Never\\").  Like its predecessor, the film would make a lot of money and surpass the first film by bringing over $148 million.<br /><br />And in 2010, John Chu returned as the director but this time bringing the third film to the big screen in 3D and to keep continuity with the first two films, \\"Step Up 3\\" would bring back actress Camille Gage (Alyson Stoner) from the first film and Adam Sevani (Moose) from the second film as new students at New York University.  And once again, like the previous two films, shot with a budget of $30 million, the third film would rake in $159 million worldwide.<br /><br />And now, \\"Step Up 3\\" arrives on Blu-ray and DVD on December 21st.  On Blu-ray, there will be two versions available, \\"Step Up 3\\" will be released in 3D (for those with 3D enabled Blu-ray players and TV sets) and normal Blu-ray on Blu-ray and DVD.<br /><br />\\"Step Up 3\\" is a film that focus on three-related storylines.  The first focuses on the friendship between Moose (played by Adam Sevani) and Camille (played by Alyson Stoner, \\"Camp Rock\\" films, \\"Phineas and Ferb\\").  The two have grown up with each other and now both will be attending New York University.  Because the two are best friends, they want to enjoy their life as students together and are often mistaken as a couple.<br /><br />Moose loves to dance but he promised his parents (who is putting a lot of their money into their son's education) that he will focus on his engineering degree.  But on the first day of student orientation, he accidentally gets himself dragged into a dance battle and humiliates Kid Darkness, one of the premiere dancers of the House of Samurai Dance Crew.<br /><br />Meanwhile, as he is dancing, he is being taped by a guy named Luke, who happens to be the leader of a dance crew known as \\"The House of the Pirates\\".  Luke and his group want Moose to join them and be part of the House of Pirates and prepare for the World Jam Dance contest.  And because he humiliated Kid Darkness, he will become a target of the House of Samurai Dance Crew.<br /><br />Despite telling himself he wants to quit dancing, dancing is too much of a passion for Moose that he joins the House of Pirates but his friend Camille is unaware of why her best friend is ditching her all the time and is saddened that the promise they made of being together is not being fulfilled.  Also, how will Moose deal with college when the crew expects him to be training for the dance competition during his classes?<br /><br />The second storyline features the character of Luke (played by Rick Malambri, \\"Surrogates\\", \\"Universal Soldiers\\").  A filmmaker and the leader of the House of Pirates.  He also owns the building/warehouse which houses the dancers of the House of Pirates and as a promise to his dead parents, he wants to keep the building open.  So, people can train to dance and have a place to hang out and party.  But the building's rent has not been paid for six months and is in danger of closing.  And so the motivation for his dancers are to win the $100,000 grand prize to keep the warehouse open and they know they need more dancers for the competition to take on their rivals, the House of Samurai.<br /><br />The third storyline focuses on Luke and a dancer that he has fallen for.  Her name is Natalie (played by Sharni Vinson, \\"Home and Away\\") and he has been attracted to her for quite awhile.  He gives Natalie a place to stay and the two grow closer together and eventually fall for each other.  With the addition of Moose, Natalie also joins the House of Pirates.  But what Luke doesn't know is that Natalie is the sister of Julien (played by Joe Slaughter), the leader of the House of Samurai and Natalie was sent by him to spy on the House of Pirates dance crew.  But can Natalie hurt the House of Pirates after she has grown close to them and has become one of them?  Can she hurt Luke now that she has fallen in love with him?<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Step Up 3\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1) and the first thing that came to my mind is how vibrant this film looks.  From the various shots of New York City to the use of color featured in the film, I was pretty impressed by the overall look and set design.  In the film, there is an interesting use of light and costume design and CG work which I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't watch the film.  A little TRON-esque but I was digging it!<br /><br />There is a lot of detail that is seen from the building sets, the closeups of the Nike vintage shoes to the characters and more.  I did notice some occasional banding on scenes where there was a lot of red.  But for the most part, picture quality is pretty fantastic and I noticed no blemishes, artifacts, combing, crush, etc.  Blacks were nice and deep and colors just pop!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Step Up 3\\" features an English 7.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-bit) lossless soundtrack.  Also, presented in French and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1.  Dialogue and music is crystal clear and for low frequency, although not an action film, it's definitely a film that is driven by its music from Flo Rida (feat. David Guetta), Trey Songz, Jay-Z and Alicia Keys, Sofia Fresh (feat. T-Pain), Wisn y Yandel and more.  Bass is continually pumpin' and you could hear the resonance through your subwoofers when you hear that LFE.  Because of the 7.1 track, there is also use of surroound and rear surround throughout the film.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Step Up 3\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Born from a Boombox: A Luke Katcher Film - (11:51) The full \\"Born from a Boombox\\" film that the character Luke shot with interviews of the House of Pirates dancers.<br />  * Extra Moves - (7:20) Behind-the-scenes of \\"Step Up 3\\" with the making of the various dance scenes throughout the film and featuring the various music from the film.<br />  * Deleted Scenes - (23:57) Featuring optional intros by director Jon M. Chu.  Featuring eight deleted scenes.<br />  * Music Videos - Featuring the following music videos: \\"Club Can't Handle Me\\" - Flo Rida feat. David Guetta, \\"My Own Step (Theme from Stepup 3D)\\" by Roscoe Dash and T-Pain feat. Fabo, \\"Already Taken\\" by Trey Songz, \\"This Girl\\" by Laza Morgan, \\"This Instant\\" by Sophia Fresh feat. T-Pain, \\"No Te Quero (Remix)\\" by Sophia Del Carmen feat. Pitbull, \\"Irresistible\\" by Wisin y Yandel, \\"Spirit of the Radio\\" by Jrandall.<br />  * Making of the Music Videos - (7:15) The music talent talk about the making of their music videos.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Step Up 3\\" comes with a slip cover case and along with the Blu-ray, a DVD is included.  The DVD is presented in widescreen (1:78:1 - enhanced for 16×9 televisions).  Audio is in English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When it comes to dancing films, I know that there are film critics who just can't get into them.  But for me, I absolutely enjoy watching the choreography of these films and seeing how far they can take it to the next level.<br /><br />For me, the \\"Step Up\\" and \\"Stomp the Yard\\" films are known for their choreography and the plots are typically hit or miss with the viewer.  For \\"Step Up 3\\", I absolutely enjoyed the film, its plot, the music and the choreography.  Having friends who are part of the dancing scene, the dance battles and also into collecting those special edition, vintage Nike shoes, I enjoyed the integration of it into this film.  But while the dancing and the battles are a constant theme of these films, \\"Step Up 3\\" is a pretty stylish film.<br /><br />I have to admit that at first, seeing Rick Malambri as the male star of the film, I felt he was too clean cut for someone to be part of street dancing.  Someone you would see as more fashion model than someone who would lead a dance crew but everything worked out quite well.  Especially since the film incorporates so many characters, it helps when you have returning characters like Adam G. Sevani and Alyson Stoner as part of the film and the addition of Australian actress Sharni Vinson was quite interesting because similar to Rick Malambri, the first things that cross your mind is \\"can these two dance?\\".  And sure enough, both pulled it off.<br /><br />Also, it helps by by surrounding the two talents with a plethora of dancing talent and according to director Jon M. Chu, over 250 talented dancers were part of this film and these dancers are among the top dancers in the world.  So, if anything, these dancers help compliment the talent and also because of the additional dance talent, we are seeing various styles of dancing being incorporated to this third film that we haven't seen in the previous two films.<br /><br />And in many ways, I like the \\"So You think You Can Dance\\" style of mentality brought to this film by bringing these talent known for a certain style of dancing and then getting to learn various styles of choreography and each of these talented individuals have pulled it off.  The dancing of this film is phenomenal and for those who are passionate about dancing, I wouldn't be surprised if they rewind and play various scenes over and over and be in awe by it.<br /><br />As for the overall plot, yeah...there is a banality to it.  Goals to win contest money to save a club, to save one's hide.  Lover's betrayal and one being too occupied with other things and not being there for love ones.  Yeah, it's been done many times before but it works for this film.  Adam G. Sevani and Alyson Stoner have great chemistry and they bring in a young and enjoyable vibe to this film.  While Malambri and Sevani bring the more sexual and romantic aspect to the film.<br /><br />Also, I loved the cinematography and bringing that New York vibe to this film.  Also, loved how the colors were utilized and it's a vibrant film that really looks great on Blu-ray!  And of course, the music is pretty awesome.  From the characters of Luke and Moose traveling through New York with Jay-Z and Alicia Keys \\"Empire State of Mind\\" blaring through your front channel speakers to Flo Rida and David Guetta playing during a pretty cool dance scene and there are many more scenes with cool music, awesome choreography and memorable moments.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release has pretty awesome PQ and the music is more of the dominant factor for audio, while dialogue and music is crystal clear, there is some usage of the surround and rear surround channels.  But it's the music that dominates the soundspace.  Also, there are good number of special features that feature more dancing scenes and dancers that were cut out of the film due to pacing and making the scenes flow.<br /><br />As mentioned, there are two versions of this film being released on Blu-ray.  For those with a 3D Blu-ray player and 3D enabled television, you can purchase \\"Step Up 3D\\".  While those who don't have the 3D hardware or don't care for 3D can purchase the Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.<br /><br />Overall, I know that dance films are not for everyone.  But for those who love street dancing, \\"Step Up 3\\" is a pretty enjoyable film and the choreography was phenomenal.  If you enjoyed the previous two films, I definitely recommend \\"Step Up 3\\".from a Boombox\\" film that the character Luke shot with interviews of the House of Pirates dancers.      * Extra Moves - (7:20) Behind-the-scenes of \\"Step Up 3\\" with the making of the various dance scenes throughout the film and featuring the various music from the film.      * Deleted Scenes - (23:57) Featuring optional intros by director Jon M.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|The oprah narrating was not very good. Also, the oprah version is 100 minutes shorter and in 1080i instead of 1080p.     The Attenborough version is great and in 1080p and 550 minutes instead of 440.
044656740X|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend a couple years ago and borrowed a copy of this book. This is perhaps the single most important book that has changed the course of my life. It has sparked my interest in finances, investing, and economics. As a result, I am studying to receive my B.S. in Math/Econ.     Unlike many investing books that give complicated analysis of investing, the author uses reasoning as a means of justifying his method. Even the most commonly thought investments, such as a house, is addressed and may baffle all that you have learned. You will relearn and wipe away all those myths about investing. What is nice is that he compares his \\"poor dad\\" to his \\"rich dad\\", showing how one set of beliefs were inefficient while the ladder was all about the future. This has changed my outlook even on people I meet. Those who \\"look\\" rich, with expensive clothes and other accessories are actually \\"poor\\" because they do not have their money invested in assets. Rather, they put their money into immediate satisfaction. \\"Rich people\\" are those who invest their money into assets, making their money work for them, instead of working for money.     Overall, this book is a must read for all young adults and a great introductory to investing. This makes a perfect gift for high school students moving to college and about to get their first job.
B002N5N5QQ|4.0|Season 2 of Sons of Anarchy is by far the best season of SoA. Although some of the scenarios and story arcs are blatantly far fetched and unreasonable, most of the writing is very true-to-life, and it makes for great entertainment. If you are a motorcycle enthusiast and you're looking for a good dramatic series to get into, this would be the one. Season 2 is definitely the peak of the show - the characters have been really well rounded out and developed, and the plot lines begin to really fall into place.
0061730335|5.0|This is one of the best (if not the absolute best)  books I've ever read.  It's an autobiography about a boy struggling to live in a poverty-stricken area of Africa. It is such a poignant story. The hardships in the story brought tears to my eyes while the triumphs (even the small ones) made me laugh out loud.     I heard about this book over a year ago on The Daily Show and from TED videos.    After learning about this book, I bought it (digitally) right away but I hadn't got around to reading it until now. It starts a little slow, talking about the cultural superstitions about magic but this adds an important aspect to the main theme of the story. Once I got to the 'meat' of the story, I couldn't put it down.      The aphorism that most aptly summarizes the plot is \\"Knowledge is power\\", but that doesn't do it justice. The author, William Kamkwamba, realizes that with a little bit of knowledge, he can prevent the deaths of family members and friends. Not only can he save them, he can help them thrive. The main benefit is to power a water pump to irrigate crops which would allow the planting of crops twice a year instead of the usual once. It would also help during droughts. He started to develop the idea during the catastrophic drought of 2001. He (and everyone around him) was starving to death. One day when he went out to work in the fields, he mentioned to his friend that his father had reduced the number of meals they could have each day  to two - \\"Isn't that awful?\\", he asked his friend. His friend responded that his family had already been doing that for weeks. Shortly after that, they had to cut down to one meal per day.      William cannot afford to go to Secondary School (it's not free) and he doesn't have much academic training. One day, he sees a Dynamo, which attaches to a bicycle wheel to power a light. It fascinates him. He begins to wonder how it works. He experiments with it and often goes to the library to read about Electricity and Magnetism. That's when he gets the idea to build a windmill. His family and friends think he's gone mad, collecting junk and preoccupying himself with things they don't understand. He quickly builds a tiny prototype and when it successfully powers his transistor radio, he nearly jumps out of his skin. He then begins to build a bigger, more functional windmill.        The people from the village laugh and ridicule him. When the day comes for William to assemble the finished windmill, many of the villagers gather around to laugh at him. When he finishes assembling it, and it powers a light bulb, everyone is in awe. His dream comes true.      Word gets out and the people from TED contact him. They ask him if he'd share his story in front of others. He gladly agrees, even though he has no idea what TED is, or even what a 'conference' is. When he finally gets to TED, and is on stage giving his story, he expects all the intelligent, educated and cultured people to laugh at him. When the audience erupts in applause, he can't believe it. When asked how he built the windmill, he briefly goes through his story and says, \\"I try, and I made it.\\" The audience erupts in exuberant applause and the motto of that TED conference becomes, \\"I try, and I made it.\\"    The main points that make this such a brilliant story to me are:  - tenacity and hard work pays off  - scientific, logical thinking defeats superstitious, magical thinking and can help turn a poor nation into a successful one  - a passion for learning is often necessary for life (literally)     It's a great story and I strongly recommend it. If there were more William Kamkwambas in the world, it would be a better place.
0061205699|5.0|It almost seems pointless to write a review of this book given the number already here. But out of curiosity I clicked through to the bad reviews to see what people were saying. It's astonishing and frightening. Just like the book.<br /><br />I've read this novel about a dozen times over my life -- I'm now 53. Every time I read it, there is something in it I did not see before, and I imagine that is because my own view of life and the world has changed over time. There are many novels that I loved at some point, but when I read them again I find they aren't what I remembered. This novel is not one of them. It grows richer and deeper with each reading, and no matter what, I weep at the end when Scout realizes it's Boo who saved her brother's life.<br /><br />It is a novel rich with characters, interesting complicated characters, and that is what always draws me back to this story. If you read it in high school because you had to, please set aside what it meant (or didn't mean) then, and read it again. It is larger and more expansive than you ever could have understood then. Really.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|A simple, short read that it a great intro to Dicken's other (much lengthier)stories.  \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is probably only 50 pages in print, but packs enough suspense and character into those 50pages.  A great start for anyone itching to read a classic (and possibly thinking of tackling Dicken's other novels!)
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I rarely buy movie soundtracks, but it was kind of hard not to buy this one after it turned an already pretty good film into something mesmerizing. I think this music works slightly better when watching the epic visuals of the film, but there are so many great electronic beats and melodies going on here. You can really just lay down, put on some headphones and get transported to your own virtual landscape within your mind.<br /><br />By the way, I had never heard of Daft Punk before watching Tron Legacy, but I'm very impressed with the work they turned in here. I hope they get the opportunity to score more Sci-Fi films in the future.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: The Grid, Recognizer, Rinzler, End of the Line, Derezzed, Flynn Lives, End Titles, Sea of Simulation
B000H8RWEM|5.0|Chloe and the Pirates is an extremely beautiful bright piece of music,with fine atmospheric organ sounds, slowly climbing up and down, steady bass lines and electric piano chords and above all great elegant oboe playing by Karl Jenkins. It's like a bird cry in a mysterious warm afternoon landscape. To me their very best composition. Also the minimalistic Soft Weed Factor is fascinating. The other two tracks of the studio part are less convincing. Much better then are the first live set (tracks 1-5, the originally first side of the double album) and the first two tracks of the second live set on this album.
1439130833|3.0|It's basically a quote book. Nothing new or special. Some of the ideas are reused several times but I guess this is useful if you are trying to form a habit.I got this as a gift to a friend who really enjoyed The Secret. She seemed to like it so it was worth the money.
B003L77GRO|2.0|I remember that prior to this season, we were told that this year it would not be about another \\"Big Bad\\" ending up on Dexter's table in the final episode. Apparently someone had second thoughts. And why wouldn't they, right? It's the show's formula and it's a financial success, so why take risks, they probably told themselves. But I for one am frustrated and annoyed by this mindset.    That's the basic issue I have with the show. Another season without notable and lasting ramifications. It's quite the opposite in fact. It yet again feels like someone pushed the reset button and we're back to square one.    But this season had far greater flaws than the formulaic nature itself. The writing was all over the place. Dialogues were laughable and cringe-worthy at times.  There's a subplot about mysterious murders involving Santa Muerte cult rituals. It's odd and uninteresting to begin with, but what makes it worse is the fact that it went nowhere. They could have completely erased that entire part of the season, as it added nothing to the overall story. It also introduced a side character, a Latina cop. Just as the plot, she was a pointless addition and also was never heard of again.    The back story of the Big Bad is thin. All we know is that he, the Big Bad called Jordan Chase, and his summer camp buddies tortured girls as young boys and kept the tradition alive into their adult years. We don't get much more.  Quickly it became clear that this is the familiar story. He's bound to end up on Dexter's table. It's a false sense of suspense. It's just lazy.    The idea of Lumen is potentially interesting, but it never takes off. It's a very clumsy approach and it feels forced.  Dexter bonds with her, as they both have a \\"dark passenger\\" inside them. It leads to some good scenes and fine acting by Michael C. Hall(not by Julia Stiles, who cannot remotely keep up with him). But in the finale, Lumen, in the blink of an eye, just doesn't carry this passenger anymore, gets on abus and the writer's are done with it. All said and done, because that's how things work in Dexter universe.    Another reviewer has addressed the numerous plot holes and cheap plot devices.  The writers always take the easy way out. For Dexter to get in a ridiculous car accident to move the plot along is just terrible writing. Same goes for how neatly the whole thing with Quinn resolved itself. Multiple things that still make him look extremely suspicious are simply disregarded.  The cheapest of all tricks was the plastic sheet scene, though. It's an unbelievable and ridiculous cop-out. Instead of playing with Deb finding out they should finally have her do so. The show desperately needs it.

I was shocked at the talk of sex and the language that was used. I hope not all teenagers out there are reading this. At least I wouldn't want my daughter reading it. Trust me I know that kids \\"know\\" about this stuff, but they shouldn't be reading it.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|I longed to play console FPS games to join my friends, earn trophies and play the exclusive console games that I couldn't play on PC.<br />After 15 years of experience with a keyboard and mouse, I just couldn't stand the controller inaccuracies and being forced to use my thumbs for the majority of my movements and actions.<br />I thought about picking up the XFPS Adapter and the newer version of it, but never did.<br />Fast forward a year or so of owning Killzone 2 and having rent access to CoD: WaW, CoD: MW2 and B:BC2 I finally got the Eagle Eye adapter after viewing some videos on YouTube provided by Penguin United and putting it on my wish list.<br />Although I've only logged about 4 or 5 hours with it so far, I'm extremely pleased.<br /><br />---------------------------<br /><br />B:BC2 Singleplayer - Played a bit of single player with my keyboard preferences mapped, although some of the vehicle movements/actions were awkward because of the loss of translation for gas/brake/shoot etc, I had a great time.<br /><br />B:BC2 Multiplayer - Just got done with my first online session.

B00008LOS1|5.0|The owner of a local CD store recently told me that the current 15 - 25 year old demographic is buying more 1970s music than the music of any other era, including contemporary bands. In fact, he said, 1970s bands like Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd outsell all of today's bands combined! Interesting statistic, if it's true.<br /><br />If the younger guys have this interest in 1970s music, then perhaps those of who were around in the 1970s should put them on to some of that decade's better music.<br /><br />Here's one contribution from me. The Who's Who's Next is one of the 10 best albums of the 1970s. As such, it should be considered one of the essential albums in any collection of 1970s music.<br /><br />It's just an excellent album throughout.<br /><br />This version of the album is worth having for the extra tracks. Pete Townshend originally intended Who's Next to be a double album (2 vinyl LPs, for those you who weren't around in the 1970s) and had intended to include these songs that are extra tracks on this CD as part of the original album release. That didn't happen and Who's Next was released as a single LP. But these extra tracks are still worth having and the price of this CD is not much higher than the version without the bonus tracks.<br /><br />The extra tracks also include a live version of Tommy, recorded at the same period as the Live At Leeds album.<br /><br />For those of you who haven't heard this album, you may be familiar with one track. The CSI TV series franchise has taken tunes by The Who as the theme music for its shows. The song 'Who Are You', for example, is the theme for the CSI show based in Las Vegas. CSI: NY uses a song from this album 'Baba O'Riley' as it theme music.<br /><br />You know you're getting old when the music you listened to in high school becomes elevator music and the theme music for TV shows. What a depressing thought!<br /><br />Bottom line: Great album. One of the 1970s best albums. If you're collecting 1970s music, this is an essential album for your collection.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|Life is the smooth, white lines that circle around and around, leading us as we go, but some walk their own way. Waves of drama mix with cool suspense, an aroma of mystery that begs us to taste, to know the one sitting before us. All that we desire is cupped by a hand that could pull us into heart or break us with revenge. We can't turn away from hero or foe, and the room falls under hush, waiting for them to converse. Their words will never fade but forever be savored as legend, and we cling to tendrils of smoke drifting over story's end, hungry to know each and every character and hungry to know what fate has planned. We can't break free. We are mesmerized by pools of determination, sparks of intensity, and we drown deep beneath the brown, murky waves. All that we are, all that we ever will be lies hand in hand with the journey of two men, twisting along the fires of their lives that will always engulf us as we drink deeply.

0425221806|5.0|This book was my introduction to Koontz books many years ago (1980).  I had been a Stephen King fan but had gotten tired of his monotonous writing style. I haven't picked up a King book since.  I love Watchers because it involves a wonderful possibility, strong characters-both good and evil, and a positive ending.  Even the evil character whose description of his deeds give you every reason to revile him throughout the book, ended up making me teary-eyed.  I love the humanity of the characters and the thought-provoking idea of what could be...  Anyhoo, if you're looking for an entertaining read and haven't become too jaded yet by life, this could be a good book for you.
0525423273|5.0|I first read about this book on Gayle Forman's blog and it immediately caught my attention. Not only the synopsis sounded great but Gayle herself said it was really good too. After that, I started noticing that every time Anna and the French Kiss was mentioned, it was always highly praised by both authors and bloggers everywhere. So of course I got curious and had to get it myself!<br />Going with the flow is not very original, but this time, the flow is right. Damn, this book is good.<br />Anna is sweet, funny, smart and didn't annoy me at all. Her voice is unique and hilarious and I laughed so hard I had to stop reading and just enjoy the moment (actually, this happened several times throughout the book). Her relationship with St Clair really got me on the edge of my seat and I kept wondering whether they'd be together or not.<br />&Eacute;tienne St. Clair was such a great boy/love interest. I loved that he was not perfect physically (but still beautiful) and that he made lots of mistakes himself.<br />I also loved the setting. Man, you don't see that many novels set in France, at least not American ones so I liked that too.<br />The prose is good, and the plot - oh my, it was nearly perfect! A great mix of fluffiness and that finding-yourself thing. Perkins really got me waiting for Lola and the Boy Next Door, which is a companion novel to Anna and the French Kiss. Hmm, can I wait that long?<br />I'd recommend this to teens and YA book-lovers. Honestly, I don't usually like this kind of romantic intrigues but this is good. Now get up and get it.

Makes me happy!!!  Since I am not a technical person at all, ease of hook-up is everything.  With this adapter I simply found a cable that would fit the adapter on one end and a port on the TV on the other end (with a little help from the TV manual), and I can now play downloadable movies (Netflix, etc.) from my computer to my widescreen TV.

B00005JKN9|4.0|This was a good movie on the gangs that ran in New York during the Antebellum period. I can tell that some scenes were made very dramatic and made for a movie. Overall, it did a very good job at describing visually the problems the gangs caused during that period. This was a very long movie and i fell asleep the first time I watched it so be prepared for a long one. Enjoy!
B004BB30QK|5.0|I've been a Predator fan since I was 8. Ever since then I've followed the Predator films, games, and movie merchandise closely. I think the three Predator movies are definitely great. The Predator himself is a badass, and the supporting characters are good additions. In order from best to least in my opinion is, Predator (1987), Predators (a.k.a. Predator 3) (2010), and Predator 2 (1990). I like all three a lot, but these are the order of my favorites. The first film has a single Predator in a Central American jungle on Earth hunting the most dangerous humans of all, combat soldiers, Predator 2 takes place 10 years after the events of the first film and has another single Predator come to Earth in urban Los Angeles to hunt cops, gang members, and drug lords, and Predators takes place years after the events of the second films story. It takes a new turn by having a new race of Predator called the Black Super Predators, basically Predators on steroids. Meaner, bigger, and more aggressive breed who look a little different than the older Predators that we are used to seeing. They abduct the most dangerous humans on Earth such as serial killers, military soldiers, mercenaries, and gang members to a certain jungle location on their home world and hunt them. They are also at war with the other breed of Predators like the ones from the previous films. They also have a Predator who looks exactly like the original Predator from the first film in every way shape and form called the classic Predator. So that's the short of these three films. They are all very good and worth having if you really like the Predator character. Each film has their own special features that will definitely keep you entertained.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This story was spellbinding.  The horror of the circumstances stayed with me for days, and the courage of the mother and her ingenuity in planning a way out was brilliant.  But most of all, I admired the manner in which she raised her little boy in the most difficult of circumstances to be a civilized person and kept him busy with skills and crafts to make him as normal as possible.  We are mostly spared details of the forced sex scenes by innuendo but not specifics, which seem appropriate as the child is the voice of the book.  I listened to a review by the author on NPR.  She hopes this story will go to film, and I do too. Very good work, and exceptional writing. I will propose the book to my several book clubs in two states.
B00003CY6M|5.0|I love this movie.  The chemistry between the actors are terrific.  Soundtrack is really good.  My favorite song by Nick Drake, Northern Sky, is in a key part of the movie.  Lots of great supporting players in the movie as well- John Corbett (Aidan from Sex & the City), and others.  Great movie to watch over and over again.
B003BKZW40|5.0|I haven't ventured into Stephen King's world in quite some time and ran across this while looking for something new of his to read. I have a well-worn copy of The Bachman Books. I used to have so many of his works and have lost all of them in moving or lending; all except for this one. I had no idea that he had self-censored \\"Rage\\", a short novella considered by many to be one of his best (it involves a boy who plans a school shooting). The original book contained that novella while the online version doesn't. Still, I would recommend the book because it contains what is, in my mind, his best work: The Long Walk. That novella is the reason I have kept my copy of The Bachman Books over all these years.
B0006J28L4|5.0|Spike Lee did an excellent job with this movie. Denzel did a great job impersonating Malcolm X and sometimes i thought he was Malcolm himself. I loved the book better but this puts the book into a three hour movie which gives viewers a good view into the life of Malcolm X.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This is my favorite Twilight movie so far.  And the only one I've purchased so far.  I love watching Bella interact with both Edward and Jacob in this movie because there was more maturity and intensity between the characters.        I really like that this product is the two disc special edition so it has more features than just the movie.  I love to watch extras and see the characters behind the scenes.  A great buy!!
B001ECQ6PG|1.0|This is a terrible turntable. The 3/5 output sounds terrible (with both headphones and a computer speaker system) and the RCA output (red and white) sounds terrible. The design of the clamshell lid leaves no room for the power supply. The internal speaker sounds like a cellphone from the 1990s.<br /><br />There are cheaper turntables that sound much much better. I could not recommend a pass on this one more.
B000025XKM|5.0|This was my first Nick Drake CD and I listened to excerpts from his 3 CD's.  This one seemed closer to his roots...simple, bare, real, authentic.  Just Nick and his guitar.  I love it and listen to it over and over.  I will purchase the other CD's in the near future.
0767836286|3.0|I have been on something of a tear lately in the wake of Jeff Bridges' Oscar victory this year for his portrayal of broken-down country singer/songwriter Bad Blake in the film Crazy Hearts. In my previous reviews my main premise had been that there was a strong thread running through many of Bridges' performances that harked back to his role as future good old boy, Duane Jackson, in the classic Texas-based coming of age film The Last Picture Show and that culminated in Crazy Hearts.     This film, Arlington Road, speaks to another thread, the intrepid, if sometimes foolhardy warrior prince fighting against evil (or at least the unknown). A previous well-known example was Blow-Up where he held off the Irish Republican Army (IRA) single-handedly (well, one agent in Boston anyway). This political thriller filled a niche after the tragic Oklahoma City bombings by native terrorists and before the axis shifted to 9/11 type foreign-based acts of terror. Thus, the notion to put a microscope to view a small but extensively-engaged proto-survivalist right wing-conspiracy against the federal (or state for that matter) government for some grievances had a certain timeliness then.     Bridges, as an undaunted professor, out to solve some baffling mystery (and also as a grieving victim of a governmental screw-up which killed his wife) that has cropped up and ensnared him in its web and Tim Robbins as the avenger bad angel and ensnarer battle this one out. Not Bridges' best performance because he is just too manic (and the script is a little too politically heavy-handed and obvious) in the end but kind of an interesting period piece just the same. The nuts are always with us, on film and in real life.
1599218011|5.0|Great book!  Can't wait to put it in practice.  Kris writes in such a fun way that you can't put it down, and there is always a laugh on every page.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Winter's Bone is, hands down, the best film of 2010. The main character, Ree Dolly, has more burdens to bear than most fifty year olds and she is only 17.  She is single-handedly raising her younger brother and sister because her mother is mentally ill and her father, who has recently been busted for cooking meth, has disappeared. To top all of this, Ree finds out that her father has put up their house and land as his bond.  She has one week to find him or risk losing the little her family has. Ree's journey to find her father takes her through the dangerous,inbred, meth-laden culture of the Ozarks. I don't want to give too much of the film away but suffice it to say, that you will be totally immersed in this film within its first few minutes and you will still be thinking about it days later. Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant as Ree. She should win the Oscar. The director has done an incredible job of bringing the Ozark drug culture to life. While some reviewers have questioned the realty of how this culture is portrayed, I do not.  I'm from the deep south (on the Appalachian side) and unfortunately it rings all too true to me. Regardless, this is a movie that you don't want to miss.
030746363X|2.0|An interesting look as Tim flies his freak-flag and describes various self-experimentation/torture around food, exercise, etc.<br /><br />Skip it, clear unequivocal advice is too hard to extract from the contradictions, sloppy math, and general fact that no clear picture of a \\"healthy\\" overall plan under any one of the regimes is provided
B00171LFFK|5.0|More than 40 years on, \\"Astral Weeks\\" sounds as fresh as the night it was recorded. Many reviewers have pointed out that this is one of the greatest musical statements of all time: a true musician's album, impossible to categorise, standing out distinctively even from the rest of Van's voluminous and consistently excellent body of work over 40 years. All played in one inspired spontaneous burst, in a 12-hour studio session by musicians who had little or no experience of playing together: in the can, done and dusted, a timeless classic created in one night in NYC.<br /><br />Bursting with youthful energy, musical originality and jazz-improvisation, featuring some of the most inspired poetic lyrics ever committed to song, the whole beautiful, timeless marvel is carried along by strings, brass, flute, acoustic guitar and the most delicious driving bass playing you'll ever hear. And then there's Van's youthful and right-on-the-edge voice, articulating those poetic stream-of-consciousness lines with such power and conviction you feel he's baring his very soul.<br /><br />This 2010 Japanese re-master restores the sound to a crispness and depth not heard since the original 1968 vinyl release when played on a top-class sound system. It really is so much better than any previous CD release. And an additional bonus: an 18-page insert with all the song lyrics in both English (thankfully) and Japanese, missing form all previous CD releases. If you love this album as so many of us do, and want to hear it as it should be heard, this is the one to buy. Why WB has not so far released this near-perfect re-master in the USA or Europe is incomprehensible: it's definitely worth the extra money.<br /><br />Someone said of Astral Weeks many years ago: \\"You can't really say why it's so great. You have to listen to it to understand that. It just is.\\"<br /><br />Words like \\"seminal\\" seem somehow inadequate to describe \\"Astral Weeks.\\" There's nothing else like it, nor ever likely to be. It's gorgeous, rich, delightful, transformative, inspired, a one-off. If you've never heard it, then it's time you did and this is the version to buy.ransformative, inspired, a one-off. If you've never heard it, then it's time you did and this is the version to buy.
B000274THQ|5.0|This is a sweet but historically informative film. For anyone interested in a quirky, funny take on the fall of communist East Germany - the Wall coming down - through the eyes of one family this is a must.

Well, move over Richard, this dog has stole the show!  Based on a true story, this dog has brought it to life.....and he steals your heart in the process.

B000OVLIQU|3.0|Here, There and Everywhere is one of those books I wasn't able to put down once I started reading.  The telling of Emrick's involvement in the Beatles recording career is full of anecdotes and insights that many Beatle fans like myself devour.  I was engrossed in reading how studio sessions were managed, how the Beatles conducted themselves, how songs were put together (listening to outtakes of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" for example, show how George Martin's intervention and the evolution of the songs as they were recorded over and over changed them from pedestrian recordings to classics).  But there is a big \\"but\\" to this reader's experience with the book.    This would be a 5 star review except for a few things that didn't sit well with me.  Emerick clearly has his favorite and probably due to the fact that he worked with Paul on post-Beatles recordings with Wings.  I know George was not the most technically proficient guitarist in the beginning (listen to some of the \\"Live at the BBC\\" sessions)but Emerick seems to pile on a bit in criticism of his playing.  He also seems to go out of his way to talk up Paul over John - in part because of their disparate personalities (Paul the politician and John the direct, unfiltered commentator - it was obvious who was easier to get along with). The worst case is a clear error in describing the making of live broadcast of \\"All You Need is Love\\" and subsequent \\"corrections\\" to the original live broadcast.  Emerick contends that George wanted to play his solo live, which prompted John to want to sing live and Paul then wanting to play his bass part live.  Emerick says that they were worried about George fumbling the solo and John needing lyric sheets to remember words - something that would clearly be seen in the telecast.  After the broadcast, they worked on the recording to clean up a 2 lines where John muffed words, redid Ringo's opening drum roll and cleaned up the last bad note in George's solo.  But whenit comes to Paul's performance, on page 210, Emerick says that \\"...Paul's bass playing was fine - there was no need to fix anything...\\"  That stopped me in my tracks and caused me to go listen to the recording again.  Clearly, at the run out of the song (the \\"Love is all you Need\\" refrain), Paul loses his place and flubs a note (and yells \\"whoa!\\") and then actually stops playing for half a measure to regain his place in the song. I can't believe that in writing this book, Emerick never went back to listen to any of the songs he engineered - if he did, he couldn't have missed this.  And what it did for me was to cast the veracity of a lot of what he wrote into question.  He clearly had biases towards the four Beatles...and he clearly was a Paul apologist throughout the book.  It actually took me a while to want to pick up the book and finish it from that point because I didn't know if I was reading fiction or fact anymore.    Probably, in the end, most of what he relates is fact but I suggest you read this with a little skepticism when it comes to criticisms of playing or singing, etc.  I'd love to reach out to Geoff and question him about that session.
193659434X|1.0|Sadly, this is not the version of A Christmas Carol that these reviews praise. There are no illustrations, no note of unabridgement. However, the text is printed on good quality paper. I've often counted on reviews to help make a purchace decision, but this time I was mislead and disappointed. The story of course is a 5 star classic, and this version a fine read. It's just not the version the reviews indicate.
0451205766|5.0|Item arrived ahead of schedule, on time, and was exactly what it was supposed to be, and in good condition. What more could I ask?!
B0042RJWTM|1.0|I received the first one defective and Amazon did a good job sending a replacement and that was bad. They both played the opening and then stopped at the security message. I do not have any issues with other DVDs or my player.    I recommend you tell the vendor.
B001R60ESE|5.0|Chris Botti's tone and musicality is mesmerizingly beautiful.  Sting, YoYoMa, and other guests add their incredible talent to this truly amazing recording.  Any fan of good music will appreciate this performance.  The blu-ray recording is outstanding.  My wife, the kids (6-year old and 1-year old), and I thorougly enjoyed this concert from our bedroom theatre.  Although the world is becoming more chaotic, there is so much beauty in it, still, and this recording (seen and heard) can restore your faith in man's ability to express his God-given creativity and beauty.  A pretty cheesy review, eh?  The recording ain't, so enjoy!
0446195529|4.0|OK.  One book ago I was ready to drop this author.  But, being a fan, I had to give him one more chance.  I am glad I did not quit him.  This kept me turning pages till the late hours of the night (Ok...  pressing next page on the Kindle).  David Baldacci you are back on my must read list.  I am ready for the next book.
B0039208JE|4.0|Since this is my first review of anything Batman-related, I should share my history with this superhero since he's such a huge part of American culture.  From the early 90's up until around 2000 or so, I was actually a pretty big Batman fan.  I loved this Batman and Batman Returns, along with the Batman Animated Series during my years of fandom.  However, after the turn of the century, my interest in Batman steadily declined as I moved on to other interests (like anime and death metal), but for the last several days, I see myself crawling back to him for reasons I'll state later.<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />In Tim Burton's Batman, the story is that Gotham City is a cesspool of filth and crime.  In the shadows of Gotham, a masked, caped crusader known only as Batman stalks the streets, beating and killing the scum.  The Batman catches the attention of reporters Alexander Knox and Vicky Vale, who seek out the Batman and hope to get footage of him for a juicy story.  Meanwhile, after a horrendous accident in a chemical factory, a dangerous criminal named Jack Napier turns into the colorfully-depicted psychopath known as the Joker.<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />The characters, in all honesty, are a little of a mixed bag.  Some are fleshed out excellently while some others feel just \\"meh.\\"  However, it's the two main characters, Batman (Michael Keaton) and the Joker (Jack Nicholson) that everyone focuses on, and I can certainly see why since the movie really is about these two freaks.  Keaton's role as Batman/Bruce Wayne really shows his versatility as an actor since he does a great job portraying Wayne as a run-of-the-mill billionaire, but when he dons the Bat suit, he unleashes a truly intimidating feeling when he preys on Gotham City's criminals.  I also commend Burton for portraying Batman as a man who has no agenda for nobility since in this movie, Wayne suffered great losses as a child and even as the years pass, the pain from that event hardly simmers, so he tries to quell his agony by  purging Gotham City of its criminals.  When Batman fights crime, he really does show off a sheer hatred for the criminals since in one scene at the Axis Chemical plant (prior to Napier's transformation into the Joker), Batman manages to tangle one of Napier's minions by the neck and essentially lynches him from one of the catwalks in the factory.  Also, towards the beginning, when Batman confronts two criminals who robbed a rich family, he pummels one of them and tells his accomplice \\"I'm not going to kill you, I want you to do me a favor.  I want you to tell all your friends about me.\\"  Also, unlike Christopher Nolan's spin on the Batman franchise, Burton's Batman isn't afraid to kill his enemies, which I personally like since it gives Batman a more menacing edge, thought all together, it's Batman's complexity that's making me come back to the whole franchise.  Then there's the Joker.  Of course, with Jack Nicholson behind the makeup, you know he's gonna nail his role perfectly.  Nicholson really makes a great Joker because his take on the character truly gives out a feeling of insanity.  Joker harms people just because he thinks it's fun, and keeping true to the comics, he adds a good amount of crazy gags to his crimes that adds more depth to the feeling of insanity (he's also one of the rare villains to be menacing and funny at the same time).  In a scene where the Joker sets up a meeting with Gotham City's main crime bosses, he kills one with an intense electro-shock hand buzzer and after everyone is forcefully escorted out, the Joker talks to the charred skeleton and at the end, says \\"I'm glad you're dead!!\\" and unleashes a really creepy laugh afterwards.  There's also scenes where the Joker doesn't really kill or hurt anyone that show how crazy he is.  The best example of this would be when he and his henchmen enter the art museum after killing everyone (except Vicky) with the Smilex gas, goes around the museum defacing a bunch of paintings while dancing to Prince.  Also, I love the fact that Burton decided to flesh out the Joker more than Batman because in the context of this film, it's very fitting.  The Joker wants to be known throughout while Batman wants to remain hidden from the public so he can keep doing what he does.  Now supporting characters, that's a little different story.  While Robert Wuhl and Kim Basinger do quite well as their roles as Knox and Vale (respectively), I felt the characters themselves felt a little hollow and stereotypical.  Knox felt pretty geeky and Vale at the end of the day, feels a little too much like the typical \\"damsel in distress.\\"  However, despite being on the stereotypical side, they were enjoyable to have on screen.  It would have been nice to have seen other characters like Harvey Dent fleshed out better as well.<br /><br />APPEARANCE<br /><br />Thanks to the vision of set designer Anton Furst, Batman is a visual feast.  The gritty, Gothic, and claustrophobic vision of Gotham City is truly amazing and is a huge component to the whole Batman experience.  However, unlike that Alex Proyas abomination Dark City, Burton doesn't depend entirely on visuals since he also has two of the most interesting (and entertaining) characters ever put on screen to bolster the fantastic visuals.  The way Gotham City looks really does look like it's in a universe of its own since it takes place in modern times but the citizens of the city dress in a style from the 1920's-30's complete with trench-coats and fedora hats, and not to mention that the colorful characters (particularly with the Joker) add some more flare to the already amazing set designs.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />Danny Elfman struck gold with Batman's soundtrack since after all, he did create the iconic Batman theme that would be a part of Batman and would even live on in the intros of the Batman animated series (if I recall correctly).  Most of the scenes are powerful by themselves, but Elfman's ear-grabbing music really bolsters the emotional impact of the scenes throughout the movie.  I'm not a big follower of Prince, but the scenes featuring his music feel really well-placed (especially the art museum scene featuring the song \\"Party Man\\").<br /><br />ACTION SCENES<br /><br />Batman really has some good action scenes to bolster the movie.  One of the best is when Batman saves Vicky from the Joker and when the Joker and his henchmen chase them down, Batman manages to evade the Jokers crew in the Batmobile and causes the Joker's crew to fly into a huge traffic pile up on the streets.  The other has to be with the final showdown between Batman and the Joker on top of the Gotham Cathedral.  It shows that Batman isn't an unstoppable titan since he takes some considerable hits from one of the Joker's henchmen (though Batman would make him fall to his death in the bell tower) and it also shows the imposing strength of Batman when compared to the Joker.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />If you're looking for a really well-made superhero film with some interesting characters and a magnificently gritty universe that's strictly its own, then Batman should be in your collection if it isn't already.Also, I love the fact that Burton decided to flesh out the Joker more than Batman because in the context of this film, it's very fitting.

B00005MP58|5.0|I really love Pride and Prejudice, the book, and saw this version a few times before I bought the movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and would recommend this for anyone especially if they love Pride and Prejudice!
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I have never reviewed a book that I have not read---until now. I don't CARE if it is not up to the 'standard'. My 24 year old daughter died 11 months ago...it's Christmas...I've read so many f----g non fiction books that my eyes are crossing AND I happen to have liked the other books on the 'Camel Club'. So Shoot Me! Please. Put me out of my misery...no, you won't, will you. So, I will spend too much ($12.99) on Kindle to get taken away. Thank you David Baldacchi. And Fie on all you others.
B002ZG98PA|5.0|Grammy, Papa, Mom & Dad, plus the 2-yr-old girl and 4-yr-old boy all thought this was THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!  Our little girl actually cried softly when the handsome Eugene/Flynn seemed to be dying. Both the two-year-old and the four-year-old sat wide-eyed and mesmerized from start to finish. We raved about it all the way back home & on into the evening. What a testament to the power of these magnetic characters and this fascinating story to draw viewers of all ages into the action. Despite the classic nature of the story there were numerous unexpected twists, turns and surprises. Lot's of sweetness, yet it was never smarmy or corny. Very funny! We did lots of laughing out loud.    I was struck anew with each scene at the creativity and the intelligence of the plot, of the genuine humanness of the characters' movements and expressions, of the wit and wisdom woven throughout the story, and of the overall quality & striking beauty of the picture as a whole. Also of importance, there was nothing inappropriate for children, yet we adults, (men & women, old and young) found this story charming, thrilling and utterly absorbing in every way.      I'm ordering Tangled right now because I can't wait to own it, and to watch it again & again.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I have to be honest, I didn't actually buy this for myself.  I wanted something for my dad with a USB interface and decoder for his computer system.  After I placed the order, I realized that the USB on this does not function as a source decoder.  Since I had already ordered it, I thought I would go ahead and order the Line Out Cable and keep it.  I honestly can't believe that for $35 between the two that I would have turned the result that it did.  I'm running it out of a G3 iPod Nano into my Shure SRH840 cans.  If you know these headphones, you know that they are VERY inefficient.  This dinky looking amp totally puts their dynamic level right on par with the likes of the Denon AHD5000's.  I haven't had the fortune of playing it with my Monster TPC earbuds, but I can't wait to hear the result.  I have listened to them on my Etymotic HF5 earbuds and sadly, it doesn't help, but they aren't meant to be a dynamic headphone to begin with.  Spend the few bucks that these cost to DRASTICALLY improve your iPod listening.  Be sure to get the iPod line out cable with this for best sound.

0143118420|3.0|It's a bit rude, I think, to insult people who have been nice enough to buy your book by taking intermittent pot shots at their political beliefs.  I guess I could blame myself if the book was called, Eat, Pray, George Bush Sucks. That was not the experience I thought I was paying for.  Just when I relax into the story, here comes another zinger: (paraphrasing just a few) \\"The Republicans are busy stealing the Election!  The war in Iraq is George Bush's personal vendetta!  I'm not worried about my baby being born with birth defects, only that he might grow up to be a Republican! At Thanksgiving I am grateful that we can soon elect a different President!  Ditto for all of my Italian friends who are grieving for their dead soldiers killed by George Bush.\\"    Okay, I haven't finished the book yet...but something tells me she isn't going to get any less intolerant and immature in India and Bali.  This is just an FYI for anyone with political beliefs not exactly coinciding with the author's, or people with good manners who might find a book peppered with gratuitous partisan references obnoxious.  The rest of you will enjoy it very much.
0743297334|1.0|The great modern philosopher Charlie Sheen observed that Hemingway had taught him that the meaning of life was to 'fight a bull ; plant a tree; have a son; write a book' but<br />I dont get Hemingway, at least any of his novels.  'The Snows of Kilimanjaro' and 'The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber' are among the most sublime of short stories, but the novels arent of the same level.<br />This may be one of the great novels of the 20th Century, but I couldnt understand what the fuss was all about.<br />Hemingway's prose - supposed to be 'hard, athletic' - is insipid, dull and child-like.  Frankly,  some 15 year old could have written this aimless plot, inane observations on life, and general inability to maintain the reader's interest.<br />  Now, will someone please explain why the hell bullfighting is such a noble effort anyway.  I mean there are soldiers  (even in Hemingway's time) fighting and dying for great causes, poor people struggling with poverty and disease, ...<br />  And this Hemingway decides that some boring jackass trying to bag some idiotic English woman - while wasting his time in bull fighting arenas is somehow a great, noble story worth caring about?<br />If this book doesnt convince you that Hemingway writes junk,  try 'The Old Man and the Sea'  now this may intended to be a meditation on what makes a creature (man or fish) noble but to me it was another children's book which might be more interesting if it had been written by a child.
193413712X|3.0|I found parts of this book to be great and I couldn't wait to see where the author was going.  However, the book also contains a number of dull pages, i.e. the inner workings of clocks in excuriating detail, and other nonsense like how to build a bird's nest.  While I did enjoy the timeline hopping, I was not a fan of switching back and forth between first and third person.  Overall, I thought it was a beautifully written book, vibrant details, and the author really knows how to paint a picture with description.  Unfortunately there was just too much filler, which is surprising given the book itself is only 191 pages, for me to give a higher rating.
B003Z9Q4WG|1.0|I am and have been a fan of Maestro Bernstein most of my life but this is just another one of Sony's re-re-re-repackagings of the same material. If you're new to the magic of Bernstein, then you'd do well to get this. BUT if you have any of these, save your money as these aren't new remasterings. Shame on Sony for releasing this same material for the umpteenth time hoping to get unwary buyers.
0316078913|3.0|Luckily I have read other Sedaris books before, so I know what he is capable of.  The first story was funny, the rest, not so much. The story of the family in competition with their neighbors, which was supposed to be a satire on our one-upping our neighbors, was so over-the-top to not even be entertaining and certainly not funny.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Bleeping incredible. Bleeping powerful. And bleeping awesome.<br /><br />The East Coast version of Heat. Maybe even better.<br /><br />Had no idea Affleck could be this bleeping great.<br /><br />Easily worth the rental and a must have for fans of heist dramas.<br /><br />Seriously wicked good flick.
B000002WNP|5.0|This was a must have for my Elvis library. It was just a little disapointing as I was looking for a couple songs that I hoped were on it but were not but it is still well worth the money
B00428ZRFE|5.0|If you loved her first couple of cds, you know before she invented this \\"new Rihanna\\", you are going to love this cd. The beats are hot, she's actually saying things that people can relate in this cd, and she gives us a island feel. Rated R was a bit much for me. I guess after the whole thing went down between her and Chris she wanted to show everyone how \\"bad\\" she could be. LOL! This is a cd I wouldnt mind playing with my little cousins around. There isn't a song I didn't like.
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|A nicely laid back blues rock fusion album with some excellent tracks and a high overall standard.  The sound quality is very good for a CD.

0671207822|5.0|Isn't this what we're all looking for?  The story of his journey is fascinating and a quick read - impactful.  The psychological explanation is very interesting and makes sense.  If we can find meaning in our lives, we live much more fully.  I enjoyed this book very much and highly recommend it.
0307588343|4.0|I believe Larry has written a book about the absolute greed that was part of the banking world the end of the 90's and the early part of the 2000's. These are bankers that thought that they could do no wrong, but when they realized they were in trouble, they turned to the US government to bail them out. Some were lucky and got the bailout and others were not. They were playing with the average citizen's investments and homes and destroyed it all. Larry explains how it happened and what we will have to deal with in the coming years. A good read!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Just purchased this backpack as a gift for my dad. We both do photography with smaller body digital SLRs and I used it for a few days on my trip over to give it to him (I live in the states and he lives in the middle east, so it's quite a long trip - I used this bag as my carry on). I found the bag to have great construction and overall just be an excellent product. The compartment closest to you is where the camera equipment goes - there are velcro sections which can be moved around and it could hold 2-3 bodies and 2-3 lenses, depending on their size.    There are to more zippers on the outside of the big section (so they're farther away from your body). The next biggest one is PERFECT size for my 13\\" unibody MacBook Pro, but might be too small for other laptops. It would also be a great size for an iPad, netbook, or smaller laptop. This section also has a little pocket thing inside which would probably be good for keeping an iPad from moving around. This pocket is farther away from your body, which is unusual for a laptop section (and it probably wasn't designed for holding a laptop), but it fits my bag perfectly.    Some reviewers were concerned about the \\"amazon basics\\" logos on the zippers. They are noticeable, but don't bother me. If they did, they could be removed and replaced or covered in plastic coating, as another reviewer suggested. Not really an issue unless you really care about this kind of thing.    As backpacks go, this one is on the smaller side. I think this is preferable for a camera bag, as it could already hold far more photography equipment that I have. Personally, as I don't have this much equipment, I don't think I'll purchase one of these bags. However, I am tempted to (and might cave) just because it holds my MacBook Pro so well and is just a quality backpack at a great price.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|My husband and I LOVE these guys! We have two boys in their early twenties who also dig this band. Whenever we went on family trips, Alter Bridge was guaranteed to make the playlist. Myles Kennedy's vocals are powerful and beautiful. Alter Bridge is a brilliant rock N roll band and their music should be a part of everyone's music collection!

B000VSBX34|5.0|It's fab to be 13 again, watching the Beatles as cute young guys. They did a fine job restoring the movie and the sound quality was very good.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|I love Fringe, from writing to story to acting.  The reason I only gave four stars was because of the subtitles of the DVD in Chinese.  I don't know whom they hired, but the Chinese translation is not good.  It is not horrible, but it definately does not grasp the essence of the lines in many scenes.  It's a disgrace to my favorite show.  I don't know if the executive producers or any crew members of the show will ever read these reviews, but if they do, I hope they'll hire someone else to do the Chinese translation for the third reason DVD.
B00192IV9U|5.0|MICHAEL is, once again, phenomenal. The vocals show new growth in his style. There's a touch of his old school sound with a touch of today's musical elements. He's always been able to adapt and impress, and even though he oversaw this project from the heavens, I think he would approve of the quality. If your a fan, or aspire to be, give this one a chance, it's really got some great grooves, touching lyrics and moving melodies. It's Ear Ecstasy. Thank you Michael Jackson and thanks to the Estate.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is just nothing short of awesome. It has plenty of room, good padding, and enough pockets to keep even the most disorganized person well organized.     The bag is comfortable, and I found the straps to be plenty long enough even for us bigger guys. The bag is well constructed, and easy to customize to your needs.     All in all, great bag with a great price.
030746363X|5.0|Not going to write a novel as some did, but loved the book.    Tim takes a lot of very complex concepts and breaks them down into easy to use segments which enable immediate application.     The fact that he's used his own body as a human guinea pig and has tried each and every one of the theories he touches on gives so much more weight to the information.  Compare that to typical scientific papers/books which typically are written by someone who has only done research and thinks the principles \\"should\\" work in practical application.    Highly recommend it.    J
B0047O2HJW|5.0|The vinyl mono versions of these classic albums sound better than any CD ever could. I even prefer these to stereo LPs I purchased years ago. The packaging is great...well worth the purchase price.

B001UV4XFG|5.0|This one makes me want even more!    I can't wait for the next episode to come out next year.    If you are a \\"Twilight\\" fan,(or not) this brings you up to date on what has happened in an instant, just enough to let you know where you left off in the last one.   BUT....   the ending keeps you on the edge of your chair, probably pulling out your hair, wanting more!!!
B00005LOUP|1.0|Ok, here is the deal. I watched this movie in class today and I have to say that I HATED it!<br />But, it does have it's moments. Here is a list of the Pros and Cons<br />PROS:<br />1. Jim Carrey once again does a great job acting<br />2. Some funny jokes and comedy bits<br />3. Most of the scenes on Whooville lived up to the original (The toys and the look of the people were great.)<br />4. Good randitions of the original songs<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. I find that the movie is way too long. Especially around the end. This one scene goes on, and on to the point where I was bored with it<br />2. They changed the story a bit. They showed a bit of the Grinches childhood saying why he gates Christmas. Personally I hated it.<br />3. Althought Jim does a good acting job he overdoes it sometimes<br /><br />So overall this movie is... Ok. It's worth a watch if you must, but I would never buy it. If you are buying the grinch you should buy the cartoon version. That's a five star movie :D
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Because this movie will move you. So well done.. I Loved IT!!<br />Well done Disney. You should get also the real footage..even more amazing then the movie!!
B0037KMHRY|4.0|I saw this movie recently and at different points during the show, I was commenting in my head how good the soundtrack/music was.  It really fits the movie.  I found myself humming to one of the tracks on the way home.  Listening to this album makes me want to watch it again.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Very pleased with this product.  It was a last minute Christmas gift and was also pleased with how quickly the dvd was delivered.  Have ordered from Amazon on several occasions and always pleased with their prompt mailing and reply to problems.
1439133948|5.0|As usual Bujold has written another excellent novel. I've been awaiting another Vorkosigan novel for a long time.  She has not disappointed me with this one.  If you enjoy reading this author's work, buy this book!
B000YDOOU0|5.0|OK, I admit to being one of those Metheny fans who like those similarly afflicted by Bob Dylan would probably go thru the man's garbage to discover what secret gems might be deposited there, given the opportunity. That being said, I haven't followed Metheny everywhere, I'm still not ready for \\"Song X\\" and the \\"Orchestrion\\" concept left me a little cold, so perhaps I have some objectivity. This album though, is truly special. A unique selection of tunes that are stretched and augmented by the stellar talents of Sanchez and McBride. For me, \\"Calvin's Keys\\" and \\"I'll Take the Red One\\" are stand out tracks with each offering something new and different to the Metheny repertoire.
B004FKGX8Y|5.0|This is one of the best movies I saw this year. The plot is deep and very detailed. The movie can seem confusing to some but watching twice really is worth it. You'll definitely catch anything little detailed you missed the first time. Christopher Nolan's writing and directing skills have always been great and they will not disappoint in this movie. The movie is mind boggling and definitely worth the purchase.<br /><br />As for the Steelbook, the packaging is great. It includes 2 Blu-ray discs, one being the Movie and the Other Special Features. Digital copy is included as a download and not on DVD. However, a DVD version of the film is included so you can watch on any DVD player.

B00428CPUY|4.0|Great production values, great music in general and it generally captures the feel of the day but some of the editing / song selection leaves a lot to be desired.  The omission of by far the crowd favorite of the day - Jeff Beck's version of Sly and the Family Stone's \\"(I Want to Take You) Higher\\" is a sin of biblical proportion! There were other artists that were similarly treated, so I can only guess that the business took precedence over the music in this collection.    That being said - it's still worth it the money.
1401216676|3.0|This is a much hyped Batman story from the pen of Alan Moore, drawn by Brian Bolland and origninally coloured by John Higgins.  Personally I felt the story was fine but not as good as The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller and Lyn Varley which had a more orignial take on The Joker. This is a good story but not a great story, I don't think Alan Moore is overly taken with it either.   The most annoying thing was the poor joke at the end which let it down, it implied The Joker and Batman shared a moment of humour (and not a good joke at that) after the atrocities The Joker had caused.   Brian Bolland's drawing is quite impressive although some of his drawings of The Joker makes the character look a bit doe eyed and not as menacing as he should have been.  The best thing was the colouring, John Higgins really made the images stand out from the page, Mr Higgin's is a much underated artist and second to none when it comes to colouring.  Unfortunately the new 20th anniversary delux edition has Brian Bolland re-colouring the artwork.   I know he didn't like the original colouring but he just hasn't the sense of colour for this kind of job. He's mostly a cover artist and can't balance a page adequately let alone a series of pages, he just isn't adventurous with the medium. The new colouring, albeit clean, lacks any drama, there's no lift to the line work that the original had.   If you buy this graphic novel, buy the original version as the colouring was probably the best thing about it.

0345505387|4.0|A lone woman appears beside a circle of standing stones. No one knows why this \\"Sassenach\\"--this Outlander--has appeared in their midst half-naked wearing only a shift, but truth be told the Scottish Highlanders with whom she has fallen in have other, bigger worries. It's 1743, and tensions between them and the English are on the rise. The sadistic \\"Black Jack\\" Randall taunts them with his cruelty. Meanwhile, the mysterious woman is entrusted into the care of Jamie Fraser, a handsome young man with a price on his head. Despite a dark past, he is soon captivated by her.     The woman's name is Claire Randall Beauchamp, and she is a nurse who hails from the mid-20th century. Somehow, she has been magically transported back to a time where her husband's ancestors made history--to the eve of violent tragedy that will be forever etched into Scotland's history. And she is about to discover the greatest love of her life, time travel notwithstanding. The Exile: An Outlander Graphic Novel retells the events of the first third of Diana Gabaldon's classic novel of historic fantasy and romance from the point of view of Murtagh Fitzgibbons Fraser, Jamie's godfather and sworn protector.     Few of Gabaldon's legions of devoted fans are likely know to that, before she penned Outlander, she spent several years writing scripts for Walt Disney Comics. A longtime lover of comics herself, she jumped at the opportunity to be actively involved in the graphic novel edition of her most famous creation, and in The Exile are clear traces of both her enthusiasm and experience. The storyline, though not narrated from Claire's perspective, remains utterly true, and the marriage of picture and text is a skillful one--this is not, thankfully, one of those books that tells you in a text bubble what you are supposed to be looking at in the panel.     Artist Hoang Nguyen brings his considerable raw talent to the table here, with page after glossy page of wistfully colored, pitch-perfect airbrushed romance. Although the transitions between panels are occasionally clumsy and the action scenes invariably awkward, Nguyen's pinups of the main characters are absolutely dead on, and devotees of the novels will rejoice when they see the lovely Claire and the handsome Jamie come to life. Naturally, one must not forget to include also the obligatory fanservice: the wedding scene, its explicitness a subject of much editorial debate and controversy.     Few comic adaptations of novels ever live up to the original, especially when the novel a one as complex as The Outlander. Nevertheless, Del Rey has managed to produce a credible addition to Gabaldon's literary oeuvre that is certain to become a must-have for loyal readers who are liable to have never picked up a graphic novel before. Given that, the fascinating and extensive behind the scenes commentary at the conclusion of the book is not just a bonus but arguably a necessity. In sum, The Exile represents a rare opportunity, and one that ought not to be missed. Recommended.       -- Casey Brienza

B0015DROBO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. To be honest, the cover turned me off. I thought it was more of a teenager-fantasy type book, like Twilight. It was recommended by a friend, who assured me otherwise. She gave me the Dragon Tattoo (first book) and Fire (second book), because she knew I would blow through the first book and want to begin the second one immediately afterward. I couldn't put the first one down, and the second one was even better. It's a complete book, with family/friend drama, love/sex, action, murder, suspence, travel, history, and even a little on sports (there's a boxing cameo). Going to by the Hornets Nest (third book) on my Kindle and read it over Christmas.

B0044KU7KU|5.0|This album is definetly different than MCR's prior ones. At the first listen I wasn't sure what to think of it. But by the third listen, I was hooked. These songs are catchy and well written. This album does have a more dance-y/synth sound to it, which I thought an emo/punk/alt/pop band like MCR would be crazy to try to do. But they actually pull it off without sounding corny or too 'pop.' The songs are well crafted with catchy melodies. The stand out songs for me are Bulletproof Heart, Save Yourself I'll hold them back, The only Hope For me is you, Sing). Planetary (Go) is the most non-MCR type song on here. Its a dance type song, something that I wouldn't be surprised to hear in a dance club. But overall its a good catchy song. One song (Summertime) is a really bland radio-friendly song. It's not bad but it's not up there with the rest of the songs. Overall, this album is worth buying. It is probably MCR's best so far.

1572816112|5.0|for some people this deck may seem to obscure or dark, but in reality this deck contains a great intrepretation to tarot symbolism. The artwork is vivid  and gives subtle hint to each card dennotive meaning. If your considering learning to read tarot without using RWS symbolism this is a great deck to use. The concept of this deck is to think outside the box,  look at the darker aspect of things and bring out the positive. i admit that at times the pictures depicted are overwhelming, but if you study the cards long enough the images grow on you and oddly enough end up making you smile.    a good example; 'the death card' depicts a pregnant demon stepping on what appears to be a baby demon try to crawl back into  the pregnant demon denoting that 'somethnig must end before something begins'.     this tarot has  became popular in the tarot community because the has even been voted deck of the year. and i am a bigg supporter of this beck. whether your considering buying this deck for collecting or reading it's worth every penny.     theres nothing wrong with looking at the darker side of things and this deck is evidence of that... i encourage you to get this deck
0385737424|3.0|The premise for this book sounded wonderful. 'A Wrinkle in Time\\" is one of my most favorite books ever and I think the concept of time travel is really interesting. I was looking forward to seeing how the earlier book was incorporated into this one. I was disappointed to find the only \\"incorporation\\" that I could see was that Miranda was reading the book and mentioned a plot point from time to time, and there was the argument with Marcus over the semantics in Wrinkle.     I really liked Miranda, and as a \\"slice of life\\" in the late 1970's, this was a good book. It was well written from a young girl's point of view, and illustrated how hard growing up is, and trying to figure oneself out as well as everyone around you. I could feel her pain as Sal dropped her as a close friend for no reason, which made no sense..why didn't he just talk to her, and her envy of Anne Marie's home, and her fear that Anne Marie won't think Miranda's home, and by extension, Miranda, is good enough. We don't know where Miranda's father is, and the plot point about her mother being on the game show didn't have anything to do with anything,in my opinion. I can see how Miranda felt kind of neglected and abandoned at times. I wasn't sure why Alice had to go to the bathroom all the time or why she was unable to say that she had to go. She was 12 years old, not four.. I really liked how Miranda and Julia got past their differences, in another maturing step. I wondered about the three 12 year olds working in Jimmy's shop, without so much as parental knowledge or permission. Maybe the child labor and health department laws were waaay different in 1978!     The science fiction components lost me altogether, and by the end, I didn't know what the author was talking about. In what universe would a 12 year old getting anonymous notes that say things like \\" I am coming, tell me where your house key is, and don't tell anyone about these notes ever,\\" be a good thing? Especially after Miranda knows her house was robbed? How can a kid who decides to beat up a smaller boy for no reason be a \\"good kid through and through\\" and then also be surprised when the smaller boy runs from him, into traffic? Someone else mentioned the fact that Miranda's mother feels free to steal from her office, frequently, which is hardly a positive example for her child, or the reader. Miranda states that \\"the worse Miranda's mother feels about her job, the more she steals.\\" Nobody seemed to have any problem with it. Miranda's mother was kind of interesting in several ways, especially her viewpoints on wrong and right. The ending was completely confusing.    There were definitely some positive messages in the book and some that are less so. I am not sure how it won a Newbery. That award has always been a barometer for excellence and I hope the standard continues.
B003UESJHO|4.0|The Fighter is a blue collar biopic about Micky Ward (Wahlberg), a hard-nosed boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts with an affinity for liver punches.  Following the undulating path of his boxing career, the movie shows in the incredible familial struggles Micky had to confront in order to position himself as one of the most exciting boxers of the last 50 years.  Wedged between his brother Dicky Eklund (Bale), a former boxer who returned home a local legend after fighting Sugar Ray Leonard, a controlling mother (Melissa Leo) who is one of the most disgusting characters ever to \\"grace\\" the screen, and a caring but conflicted new girlfriend named Charlene (Amy Adams), there is pressure on Micky to fix everything, to make everyone happen, to live up to or exceed his brother's lofty reputation and win a championship.<br /><br />What I liked about The Fighter is the fact that it's not a generic boxing movie where we see a little of the character's life, and then a montage of boxing matches.  This is supposed to be about family just as much - if not more - as boxing; and, in that sense, it accomplishes its goal because Micky often gets overshadowed by the rest of the story.  Whether that's because of Wahlberg's patented whispering portrayal or not I can't say, but the fact remains that The Fighter allows the costar and the subplot to take center stage.<br /><br />The biggest downfall of any sports movie is a lack of authenticity.  Watching Tim Robbins rag arm performance in [[ASIN:B00005V9HG Bull Durham]] just about ruined the film.  The same could to said of Omar Epps as an NBA player in [[ASIN:B0010SB0CI Love & Basketball]] - what is he, 5'9\\"?  In that light, I'd give The Fighter a solid 8 out of 10 on the believability scale.  Bale jukes and bobs throughout the entire movie - possibly more crack addiction related than anything - and Wahlberg trudges forward stoically with disregard for his face in hopes of landing one big body blow.  As an avid boxing fan, however, the left hook, left hook, left uppercut, left uppercut combination was just a little too preposterous to dismiss.  The rest, however, the sparring, the glove work, the patternless movements from light-on-his-feet Dicky, it's all genuine.  The only other issue I had with the film was that the three most famous fights of Ward's career - the epic war against Gatti - are left out of the story.  Those fights define Ward more than anything else, and would have served as a perfect reinforcement of the metaphorical hard-nosed demeanor expressed throughout the movie.<br /><br />Aside from a collection of the ugliest actresses ever assembled on screen - portraying Micky's sisters - the cast is fabulous.  Once again Bale suffers for his career, dropping almost as much weight as he did in [[ASIN:B0007Y08QA The Machinist]].  Even a cameo by Sugar Ray Leonard rings true, as he comes off as friendly but also a bit aloof.<br /><br />I don't know if I put it above [[ASIN:B0006GAOGI Rocky IV]] or [[ASIN:0792833236 Raging Bull]] historically, but the solid one-two punch from Wahlberg and Bale are enough to setup most audiences for the triumphant body blow of a finale.<br /><br />Jason Elink, left uppercut, left uppercut combination was just a little too preposterous to dismiss.

B00007E8UG|5.0|Diana Krall has an absolutely fantastic voice and this SACD recording helps bring that to life at home.<br /><br />The subtle textures of her singing come through clearly and the soundstage is wide with fair depth.  The music is very well engineered and doesn't carry the torch of so many modern recordings that are over-compressed and lifeless.  This recording puts Diana right in front of you, centered in the sound and very clear.  Other instruments play in different areas in the stage and are all very well represented.  With the right equipment this album will bring this performance to life in your home and you can almost touch the instruments yourself as they play.<br /><br />As for the music itself, this album is the first time I've sat down and done any critical listening to Diana Krall.  I find the music to be well produced and open with a natural and laid-back feeling that I expect from a great jazz album.  The inclusion of vibraphone on some tracks just adds icing to the, already sweet, cake.<br /><br />Lyrically this album is clever and engaging with great writing and some excellent imagery.<br /><br />Overall this album is one you can enjoy listening intently to or playing as you work or accomplish other tasks around the house as it's quality is fantastic and it's also a very pleasant experience musically.<br /><br />Primary listening:  [[ASIN:B003N197EI Onkyo TX-NR808 receiver]], [[ASIN:B001CF6B32 Pioneer DV610AV-S Player]], Polk Audio Monitor 60 Series II speakers<br />Secondary listening:  Yamaha DSP-A3090 receiver, Sunfire Stereo amplifier, [[ASIN:B001CF6B32 Pioneer DV610AV-S Player]], Polk Audio Monitor 60 Series II speakers<br />Additional Listening:  McIntosh C220 tube preamp, McIntosh MC275 tube amp, McIntosh MCD301 SACD player, Martin Logan Spire electrostatic speakers
0316098337|4.0|SPOILER ALERT<br />My advice would be to ignore negative reviews, the ones I've read don't seem to have much literary merit. I agree that it was difficult to read in places because of the use of five-year-old language, although I disagree wholeheartedly as a mother and teacher with a master's degree in education that this is anything other than a \\"normal\\" child. It is not at all unusual, despite other reviews, for a child at that age to seem wise beyond their years at times and struggle with grammar at other times. The only other thing that bothered me was that Dora the Explorer would not be able to be viewed on an antenna. The author could have achieved the same plot purposes (the repetition of the steps of the escape) with another show on PBS. Those are the reasons for my giving the book 4 stars instead of 5. It's also true that the escape plan is a bit far-fetched, but there are plenty of stories of far-fetched plans working in real life for those escaping the Nazi's. (Read Night.)<br /><br />I found this book to be riveting and haunting. It made me look at my own son, who is adopted out of foster care, in a new light with greater patience and understanding.<br /><br />In response to those who are annoyed by the lack of the word the, I think you missed the point. Jack does use the word the most of the time, as in \\"the lolipop,\\" \\"the left one,\\" etc, but he refers to most of the objects in Room as proper nouns: Bed, Lamp, Table, Rug...I believe that the personification of these objects is because Jack considers them his friends. They meet his daily needs in a similar way that his Ma does, but his connection with her is much more intense and primal. I was not bothered at all by the breastfeeding as it allowed for a positive physical connection between the two and also would have provided much needed nourishment for him and a sense of purpose for his Ma. (Not only was she caring for her child, but remember the only other physical contact she had for 7 years was being raped and beaten by Old Nick.)It was not for birth control, there is a reference to her 28 pills in the package that looks like a spaceship, so I assume she was taking birth control pills.

B004BSEKH6|5.0|I have to say that I really love this album. I was a little hesitant to get it at first because of other reviews, but I am happy that I went with my own instinct and purchased it. Nicki Minaj is a \\"BEAST\\" and I love her creativity. I did expect a lot more rap, but I enjoyed the different styles she delivered on the album. It shows how multi-talented she is, and how she can partake in multiple genres of music. Its rap, pop, and much more & I couldn't ask for anything more. \\"Roman's Revenge\\" is my FAVE because she spit fyre on that track along with other tracks, and I also loved \\"Save Me\\". She did her thing on this album and she lived up to all the hype. Don't sleep on Nicki because she's the real deal. I hate that I waited this long just to buy it, but now I have it and it will be on replay for the next couple of months.....maybe even longer. Every song is GREAT and I think her music appeals to a diverse audience. I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing this album...you won't be disappointed!
B004CAWKXE|5.0|From beginning to end this album is pure rock and roll. My Chemical Romance uses several different styles throughout the album but make them all work. The three spoken word tracks are amusing. A high energy album that exudes what rock is about.
B002VPE1OS|5.0|I've been using this for 3-4 weeks now, and like it better than my last $2 screen protectors on my iPhone 3Gs.    I think overall the anti-glare is hard to notice - bit of a matte finish versus gloss, but it does provide just enough of a noticeable difference to help and provide a clearer resolution.  I've had no visible scratches on this product in the month of usage - which I can't say about my last ones.    All of the AmazonBasic products I've ordered have been great (cords, screen protectors); and this one is no different.  At this price, this will be the only screen protector I'll be using!
B000001DQG|3.0|This album is not worth five stars. Those who've made it so should have another listen to 'Solar Prestige' and reassess. Even Elton and Bernie have indicated this song was made-up trash.     Elsewhere, Elton displays his deep affection for the music of The United States, including some of the less celebrated genres. The LP suffers only because it seems casual and offhand, coming as it did towards the end of Elton's dream run, and some of the greatest albums of the Seventies.     The real jewel in the crown here is 'Ticking'. It's compelling from start to finish, and it's as raw as Elton ever got. It's an incredible performance, and leaves the listener with an altogether different vibe than if the album finished with 'Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me', which would've been the predictable choice.    It's still an essential album-- but then I'd say ALL of his Seventies albums are, although 'Victim Of Love' ends the decade on a low.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|This was a great movie.  All of the Toy Story movies are good, unlike most sequel movies where they just don't quite have the magic of the first one.  This one is funny, sad, happy, and again a visual delight.  Pixar has done it again.
B0029XFNA8|3.0|Let me start by saying that Miracle on 34th Street is one of my favorite Christmas movies: one I have watched many times since my childhood in the 1950's, and one that I am very familiar with. Since many others have reviewed the movie I will restrict my review to the pluses and minuses of the Blu-Ray release in comparison with the standard DVD release.  I have bought this movie in just about every format it has been released: VHS, DVD, DVD Special Edition, and Blu-Ray, and because of this I can make some direct comparisons. My television is a 56\\" 1080-P and my player is a Samsung Blu-Ray. I am using the HDMI connector for both DVD and Blu-Ray playback.<br /><br /> Resolution and detail: I find it nearly impossible to detect any appreciable difference between the DVD releases and Blu-Ray. The studio did a wonderful job on the DVD's and left little room for improvement in this area. Many of the black and white movies of yester-year were filmed with the focus softened ever so slightly to keep the viewer from noticing and concentrating on details such as skin imperfections, etc., and this effectively limits the amount of detail available at the source. Both releases score high marks here.<br /><br /> Picture Crawl: For lack of better terminology I'll use this to give a name to what I see in the DVD releases but not in the Blu-Ray. The picture actually moves side to side and up and down a very small amount while being viewed. This is probably a leftover from the VHS days which was not corrected until now. To see it happening clearly watch the scene where Santa is telling the shop-keeper he made a mistake in placing the reindeer. The picture almost seems to be floating on water as it sways slightly. Watch the same scene on Blu-Ray and the picture is rock-steady. This could have corrected before releasing the DVD edition but was not. I guess the studio wanted an ace-in-the-hole for the time when a new format would be released. In this category Blu-Ray is the clear winner.<br /><br /> Brightness: Here is one area where the DVD releases really shine. For some reason the Blu-Ray is overly dark and murky while the DVD looks bright and clear. This is a difference that wouldn't be apparent if watching only one of the formats, but having both really points this up. DVD is the winner here.<br /><br /> User Restrictions: Blu-Ray coupled with HDMI has an annoying ability to force what the studios want right down the customers' throats and I don't like that. This movie is going to be viewed in 4x3 mode regardless of how the television and Blu-Ray player have been configured. This is not a judgment on which aspect ratio gives a better viewing experience, I'm simply saying the customer ought to have a choice after laying out good money for the flick. No such restriction exists with DVD. You can choose to watch it either way. DVD wins here.<br /><br /> Extras: This Blu-Ray release is much like the first DVD release and doesn't have a lot of additional material to watch. For those who wish only to see the movie this is just right; but if you are one who enjoys background information, the DVD Special Edition has much more to offer. Not only does it contain a wealth of extras, but it also includes the original black and white movie, a colorized version, and a made-for-tv mini-movie (inferior in every way to the original, but included). The winner in this category depends on your preferences.<br /><br />  In the final analysis you will decide which release you like better based on your own preferences rather than on mine. Despite Blu-Ray's several drawbacks the crawl has been fixed and it may very well be the issue that tips the scales for you. I have always found it rather annoying myself (unfortunately it occurs in most of the older b/w DVD's) and am grateful to see it finally go away. If brightness proves to be a problem for you it can probably be improved through adjustments to your TV controls, but be aware that if you have had your set professionally adjusted you will be undoing all the good that was done. This Blu-Ray release is generally good, but should have gotten the same royal treatment given to the Blu-Ray release of White Christmas.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Great release on Blu-ray. Avatar (Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition + BD Live) represents the best in audio quality and image. With excellent extras, three different versions of the movie and several audio and subtitle options in other idioms (detail than other releases on BD is not and end up failing to sell more titles for collectors outside the USA). Recommended.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|Wow. Just Wow. This has always been my favorite Beatles album, and I have heard these songs countless times on vinyl, but this was a completely new experience for me. The clarity is amazing. I'm hearing things I never heard before - a drum fill here, a vocal inflection there, triangle, and are those claves on \\"I'm Looking Through You\\"? My only disappointment is that I had assumed the track list was the same as on the US LP, and two of my favorite songs are missing. I hadn't planned on springing for the entire box set, but after hearing this, I'm perusing the catalog, finding the songs I must have in this format. I will definitely be ordering more Beatles Remastered (hint hint Amazon - will they be going on sale again anytime soon?). As for the few people who didn't like the \\"seperation\\" (sic), I am very sorry that you don't own a decent stereo. I found the sweet spot in front of mine, and when I sit or stand there and close my eyes, I'm in the front row at a Beatles concert, minus the screaming fans. I would highly recommend this to any Beatles fan, or to anyone who would like to hear the best band in the world, at the top of their game, in crystal clarity.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|It is a shame some people have bad feelings about this second release.  I, however wanted the third disc. Just watching how they made this movie was worth having to get the theatrical version.  I enjoyed the extended very much.  I gave the theatrical verson to our homeless shelter for their library.  If you are unhappy having two theatricals, then give one to Boys and Girls Clubs, shelters or the Toys for Tots.

1439107955|5.0|This is the best non-fiction book I have read since GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL. It provides a masterful history of cancer, how it has been treated, and current thinking of causes. It is a page turner!  It deals not only with the science (or lack thereof) of cancer treatment, but also with the personalities of the researchers and the patients.  Cancer has been part of our biology for several thousand years, but it has only been in the last few decades that we have begun to understand cancer's biology.  It is a fascinating, and unfinished, story.
B002VECMAO|3.0|Based on the previews, I was expecting this to be a very funny, laugh-a-minute movie.  I was sorely disappointed.  The previews seemed to contain every single funny moment from the movie.  What was left was an odd combination that seriously dragged, without really giving a clear picture of what story it was trying to tell.  It is not that the movie was bad, it just did not live up to the expectation that it set up for itself.  This movie is worth watching, just be warned that if you are expecting a rolling around on the floor laugh-fest, you will be disappointed.
0316077054|5.0|BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS, the second book of a planned four-volume series, is a southern gothic fantasy unlike anything you've ever read. It focuses on magic and casters (without wands) and is set in Gatlin, South Carolina, a town populated by fundamentalists and civil war fanatics. Gatlin's peculiar appeal lies partly in its strong foundations and history, and partly in all the hateable and likable folks who live there. These people can be fierce and nosy and are obsessive about traditions, but most are good at heart and aspire to do simple things like cook a good meal or win the blue ribbon at the county fair. There are few outsiders in Gatlin and very few who know the truth about the oldest families in town.    Marion, Gatlin's kind, quirky librarian and magical keeper, is secretly in the know about the caster world. Lila, Ethan's late mother, had been another. Ethan's surrogate mother, Amma, is as aware as any about the magical plane that exists --- a descendant of one of the oldest voodoo clans in the South. And of course there are the casters, people like Macon Ravenwood and Lena Duchenne. Since meeting Lena, Ethan and Link are now closely involved with casters, but Lena, having forestalled her choice for a year, has an exclusive destiny written in the stars. As an elemental, her abilities are unpredictable and reach beyond the normal boundaries of magic.    Since the night of Lena's 16th birthday, her powers are growing, but she's having difficulty controlling her grief. With Macon lost and the outcome of her claiming ahead, it seems too much for her. Ethan is a supportive and tender boyfriend but is finding that he can't reach her anymore, despite the fact that he has experienced a similar grief. He is also becoming disturbed to see changes in Lena, and when he finally realizes their relationship is in trouble, Lena shocks him by revealing that she's leaving Gatlin.    Readers may be surprised by the unexpected changes that occur in BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS, where the central couple walk separate paths for most of the book. With Lena fundamentally changed, she enters a series of magical tunnels as Ethan tries to reach her, and amid dark casters (her cousin Ridley among them) searches for a magical nexus. Ethan, meanwhile, tries to uncover the truth about his mother and her murder, and to determine the path he must take alone. This is a troubled and unsettling time for both as they ponder their strange connection and question whether a caster/human relationship is even worthwhile, let alone physically possible. The greater conflict of this second book seems to be not so much in the outcome of Lena's claiming as it is in the choice of who she is and who she'll pick.    There are some inventive ideas in this series that are unlike any popular fantasies out there. The question of good versus evil is not as cut-and-dried as in most YA books, and the casters have some really creative abilities and different sects to keep the novel interesting. Some great new characters who are major contenders in the love stories are introduced, and most of the best people from the first installment are still present and equally important. Link and Ridley are absolutely delightful in this second book (even more so than in the first), and their antics and dialogue add humor and a little wicked pleasure. As always, Link is a wonderful friend, and I was pleased to see the suggestion of an even bigger role for him in the next installment.    Though some fans are likely to be disappointed in the rocky central love story, I would expect to see more sparks fly in the final two volumes (to be released in the fall of 2011 and 2012).       --- Reviewed by Melanie Smith

All serious knitters use her methods, this is the book to learn what knitting is all about. She encourages us to knit with our heads, to fit our bodies, using the yarn of our choice and the patterns of our choosing, and not to knit blindly following a pattern written up in gibberish (otherwise know as knitting instructions).  This book will give you control over your knitting. She writes with humor and insight.  It is a joy just to read the book, even if you aren't knitting!  Great book.

B002FVRA5U|4.0|Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell describes harrowing combat in the God-forsaken mountains of Afghanistan.  Readers feel like they are alongside Luttrell and his three SEAL comrades as they set out on a kill-or-capture mission.  Their target was a notorious Al Queda commander believed to be in one of the remote villages. But after a chance encounter with Afghan goat herders the four SEALS found themselves under attack by a force of well over 100 Taliban fighters.  The SEALS put up ferocious resistance, retreating under heavy fire and forced to make frightful leaps down the sides of mountains in an effort to escape almost certain death against overwhelming odds.  Sadly, Luttrell's three comrades didn't make it, nor did several would-be rescuers when their helicopter went down.  Readers see how Luttrell survived danger, isolation, and moderate wounds with determination, luck, and vital help from friendly Afghan tribesmen.  In addition to the gripping descriptions of combat, readers also learn about the harsh training navy personnel endure when they try to become a SEAL.<br /><br />Credit co-author Patrick Robinson with excellent prose, and Luttrell with admirable bravery.  Still, Luttrel loses points with his foolish rants against liberals and the media, while his slobbered praise for President G.W. Bush won't impress those that suspect Bush fumbled things in Afghanistan.  Luttrell also holds many Afghans in contempt, seemingly unaware that wars are largely political, and you can destroy an enemy in the field yet lose out if you mishandle affected populaces.  Despite these flaws, this remains a truly fascinating read of a harrowing combat experience.

B002ZG999U|4.0|Action has its icons. The icons had their day. Then away went the 80 and the icons washed away.<br /><br />This movie is a hard one to grad ebecause it had some nice little things in it. It lied to me about Arnold - i am going to spoil one thing here so, if you don't want it, turn away from this paragraph. Now, noting Arnold, he just popped in and popped out, complaining he didn't want any part of the mission. When Sly was asked aobut it, he said it was \\"because (he) wanted to be president.\\" While this was funny it also lied a bit, and it watered down a few choices for action stars. In some instances it even felt like some of the stars were 3rd or 4th teir, making me think of just how little of a role they played.<br /><br />Without spoiler: When I watched the Expendables, it reminded me of the difference between Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Begins. One of them is stylized and, when I saw it, i thought it was one of the best things around. When I returned after seeing a more realistic approach in Batman Begins, I noted just how empty some of it felt. The same can be said of Expendables to some extent - it felt like I fell into the 80s, hit my head a little, and woke up with an armada of icons that wer enot what I remembered.<br /><br />Life has been rough on a few of these people - this was a noticeable fact. Mickey and Sly were two that seemed strange to see, clearly making me feel like this was a feelgood flashback with some heavy chop to fuel the \\"action icon\\" idea. It was a good thing on one level, too, but the level I saw was not a grand level but was one of those things where I really didn't have to think at all. Still, I expected that and to change it up would have been - weird.<br /><br />I guess I can say that a person watching this knows what they are getting. They know that this is a feel good, roll em' out of the nursing home so they can act movie, and that might make some people happy. Expect this and this alone and you also won't feel ripped. If you expect more, however, you mightcry. I say this because you certainly won't get the movie you want, maybe that doesn't exist if you think action of that level, and because you can see it in the ads. I had a 3.6 or so on this, roudning in into the 4 star ental range. If you want it more, you are probably a fan of these people.tcry.

0307592839|3.0|I loved The Keep, and had high expectations for this book as well; I am giving Good Squad three stars, but this rating does not fully reflect the depth of my disappointment.  I know all the arguments about the ways that postmodern fiction works, or is supposed to work, but Goon Squad remains rather disappointing as a work of fiction, however defined.  I do not consider it my fault, but rather Egan's, that the characters are rather difficult to keep track of, as they weave in and out of the narrative.  There is a long and honorable pedigree to the work of linked stories, but I think such works tend to be successful when themes, rather than characters, serve as the linking principle. (The Canterbury Tales, Dubliners, and A History of the World in 10.5 Chapters succeed in part because the reader is neither forced nor required to recall characters who suddenly reappear after being ignored for dozens and dozens of pages.  In Chaucer's case, each narrator is effectively reintroduced before launching into her or his discrete and self-contained tale.)    Egan has remarkable storytelling gifts:  witness the beautiful moment, set in Naples, when Sasha's uncle sees how she captures the sun.  But such moments are rare in this book.  Consider Scotty's concert:  We are told that this is a transformative event, but I sure couldn't see or feel why this is so.  There is much that is superficially and momentarily clever, in this book, but little that coheres, and little, I suspect, that I will find myself recalling or musing over even several weeks hence.     I wonder whether Egan found herself with some really good stories, but did not wish to publish these stories as a collection of short fiction.  What might have worked, if presented as the latter, simply does not cohere as a novel, sadly enough.
0316098337|5.0|Great book! I thought I'd enjoy it when a friend told me about it, but I have trouble getting into a lot of books. It will normally take me a month at least to read a book, but I read this in a week. It's a little difficult to read at first because it's written from the point of view of a five year old. Jack speaks like a 3 year old, but seems very intelligent. Some reviews said they didn't like it because the mom breasfeeds a 5 year old. My theory is that she was still breasfeeding so she wouldn't get pregnant. I may be wrong, but I don't think people that were disturbed by that gave the book a fair chance. There are parts of the book in the middle that are a little difficult to handle emotionally, but it is wonderfully written. I highly recommend Room.
B0029QRA1U|2.0|I got this turtable for $50 at Costco. It DEMANDS iTunes, if you do not have that installed, forget it, you cannot even tell where the mp3 files are hidden...  Not a big deal though since iTunes is free, but I could not make it work under W7.  It kept saying that iTunes had to be closed to proceed AFTER I had recorded (or so I thought) 1/2h of stuff.  And of course, this was an infinite loop.  It kept saying this after I had closed Itunes since it would immediately re-open it... I was able to make it work under XP after tinkering with sound defaults but what made me return the product was the annoying whining it produces when a note is held for more than a few seconds.  This indicates a non regulated motor speed.  So, this product is good enough for rock and roll but not for J.S. Bach. Caveat emptor.

1439177783|1.0|This book is not what I expected.  I assumed this book would be about her life and events that lead to her downhill spiral, followed by her recovery and path to happiness with her wife.    It was not that at all.    We know her father died, but unless I missed something, I saw nothing about when, how, etc.  One minute her dad was alive, the next her mom was telling her she was working hard to maintain the lifestyle her father had provided them.  Did I miss something?  At the end of the book, she mentions her father dying on April Fools' Day and something about him winking at her.  Did I miss something? Did she watch her dad die?  Who knows?    What was life like on the Ally McBeal set? It seems kind of cold, but very little information as to her relationships with the other actors, the food issues on the set (and Courtney Thorne-Smith has been very up front about that the fact that there were serious food issues on the set, and one of the actresses (Ally's roommate), was marginalized then fired for being too heavy (too bad, as she was one of the more interesting characters on the show)).  None of that was there.  How did she get her next job, and did she get it post or pre-recovery? Nope, not gonna tell ya.    How did she recover? Well, not going to tell you anything about that, either, she's just going to say she recovered, and let you figure out the rest on your own.  Next thing you know, she's married and riding horses.  She reveals very, very little of her life.    This book is basically a diary of how much Ms. De Rossi ate, when she ate, how she ate, her calorie intake, her exercise regimen, etc.  If I was interested in becoming an anorexic, I would buy this book, because it's basically a how-to manual.  Yes, at the end she throws in a few paragraphs about how sick she became, but anorexics don't care about that.  The majority of the pages in this book are telling you how to starve yourself.  I don't see how this book will \\"help\\" anyone, unless of course, theywant to learn how to starve themselves to death.

B003X2O6KW|5.0|There is alot people can say negatively about Kanye, which is personal. However, when it comes to his music, the whole crowd of haters becomes silent. When it comes to Kanye West, his music clearly outweighs any opinions you may have about him, negative, positive or indifferent. Kanye has always remained consistent and proven to the world; there is more to hip-hop than money, cash, and hoes! He has proven to be consistent while eclectic.  With this album, he has produced his most grandiose and epic opus and makes use of the time to display who he is at this point in his career and life.   The album opens with the track \\"Dark Fantasy\\" complete with personality and fitting to an opening of a movie. Nicki Minaj adds to the story theme, acting as somewhat of a storyteller to kindgarteners, per say. This track is similar in style of \\"Heard You Say\\" and \\"We Don't Care\\".   The album continues with the 1st of 3 of the grimiest, urban true-to-hip hop songs, \\"Gorgeous\\" with Kid Cudi and Raekwon. This almost plays out as if it should be on a mix tape with an undeniable groove fitting to a cipher or an in studio freestyle. Kanye continues with his witty lyricism while also remaining social, in this song he mentions the TSA controversy.   This is followed by \\"Power\\", what the hardest hitting and innovative songs of his career. This is one of two songs inspired by the VMA incident. It would have been nice to have Dwele featured more predominantly on this song as he was on \\"Flashing Lights\\" from Graduation.   \\"All of the Lights\\" I listened to in its entirety when I first purchased the album and I did not necessarily get the song. The album's only main flaw is that it tends to become too busy in the songs with the multiple guests. \\"All of the Lights\\" features more than 10 at the same time or one after the other.  \\"See Me Now\\" would have been a better replacement for this song.   \\"Monster\\" is the 2nd of 3 of the grimiest songs on the album. With this album, Kanye was able to displaydifferent sides to hip-hop, proving that is more than just a lifestyle and that it is a true musical art form.  This song showcases the mix tape said of the art form, in my opinion. The hard hitting beats and thumping bass, the different personalities and personas, and the aggressive no-holds barred attitude.   \\"So Appalled\\" shows Kanye's more electic side, in vein of 808's and Heartbreak and is a pretty interesting listen.   One of my personal favorites, just on the music and the chorus itself, \\"Devil In A New Dress\\", which I'm pretty sure is a shot at Amber Rose. It's one of those songs that is nostalgic for me, it brings me back to the late 90's when hip hop was at its most commercial but classic in its own right.  This song also plays up to Kanye's personality and sense of humor.  \\"Runaway\\" is the last of the three grimiest songs on the album and one of two of the most epic songs, this song also is inspired by the VMA incident. Pusha T adds his own touch to the song and he probably could've performed a few more bars on this song, it is over 9 minutes long. This song plays up to Kanye's facetious and sarcastic side and shows that hip hop can be epic and moving and play out to a movie.   \\"Hell of A Life\\" is one of the weaker moments, behind \\"All of the Lights\\" but the weaker moments on the album are very few and they don't even qualify for filler on any standard. This Kanye, true to form.  \\"The Blame Game\\" is one of the most mind-blowing and excellent songs on the entire album. It details the fallout of his relationship with Amber Rose and last 3:00 minutes of the song is one of the most humorous parts of the album while also painting a picture. Chris Rock and John Legend really add a lot to this song to give it a serious tone while also adding a humorous spin on a pathetic situation and person, complete with Amber Rose's adlibs from the actual voicemail. Yeezy taught you well.   After the heavier moments of the album, musically and emotionally, Kanye decides toadd some up-tempo numbers and have some fun. \\"Lost In The World\\" tells the story of fame and the lifestyle. It brings to mind \\"Addiction\\" from Late Registration.   The album ends in a minute outro \\"Who Will Survive in America.\\" Which is the question I also would like to know.   Overall, the album covers a wide range of psych deficiencies and grandiosity in this life and in the industry while not making it too overly dramatic and dull. It's one of his most interesting and ground breaking albums in his career and is his best album ever.
1400052173|4.0|Rebecca Stoot explored the life of a woman whose cancerous cervical cells have been the groundwork template for many of our medical miracles we enjoy every day in \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\".  Rebecca took this very personal story and effectively integrated medical science and long range successes derived from these cells.<br /><br />So I walked away from this book more knowledgable about something I had no idea about.  In fact I was shocked that these cells even exist and that they have been so crucial for so much.  There were also so many questions posed with no answers.<br /><br />This is a book that I think about frequently as the questions it stirs are being pondered in my heart, soul and head.<br /><br />So often we forget the people responsible for medical science successes or the price to them or their families.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I had to update my Bluray player to watch the movie but it was worth it to see the great details and incredible pictures
B0007TKNCY|5.0|This was one of the first movies I bought when the classic movie bug bit me.  In fact, I think it was the first \\"Cary Grant\\" movie I had ever seen. Thus began my love of Cary Grant films and classic movies in general.  But enough about me.  This movie is just plain funny and has some of the most quotable lines of any movie I've ever seen, such as: \\"The love impulse in man frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict.\\" \\"On the side of a hill. I was born on the side of a hill.\\" \\"I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody.\\" and one of my favorites, \\"When you hear the tone the time will be...\\" Just trust me. They're funny.  It's interesting to note that this movie didn't do very well when it first came out in the '30, which is understandable, because screwball comedy doesn't appeal to everyone. But if you're looking for something to watch on a lazy Saturday or after a stressful day at work, then I recommend you give this movie a try.
B0042MEQVG|2.0|The main problem I've had with all three movies is that Kristen Stewart doesn't seem like a very good actor. All the scenes in the book that have lots of drama - yelling, crying - are just flat and dead in the movie. Anyone watching this who hasn't read the books would have no clue why Edward loves Bella. The movie Bella has zero personality. I already know Breakimg Dawn will be a huge disappointment because there's no way she'll be able to portray the fierce awesome mother Bella becomes.<br /><br />And, why do they cut so much out of the books only to add stuff that wasn't even in them in the first place? Who cares about the newborns - they all die anyway?!<br /><br />And Carlisle would never have been able to sneak up on Edward because Edward would have read his mind.<br /><br />My favorite part was when Edward confronted Victoria in the fight. It seemed like the only time we got to really see Edward without lame movie Bella in the way.<br /><br />Please please please movie people - get someone else to play Bella in breaking dawn!!! Someone we can believe would really catch the attention of someone like Edward. Oh, and, get rid of Edward's sideburns and fix all the Cullens' hair...
0784011176|5.0|The Piano has always been one of my favorite films. There's not much that I can add to the excellent reviews already written, but I would like to make a brief recommendation.    Hollywood usually gets it all wrong when it comes to \\"period piece\\" films. Most end up looking like a bad masquerade ball, with actors dressed up in costumes while speaking poorly written dialogue. Thankfully, that ISN'T the case with \\"the Piano\\". However, even though this film successfully takes the viewer to a different era in a very believable way, it's far more than JUST a \\"period piece\\"; the story itself is TIMELESS.    A story of passion, creative expression, desire, physical and emotional imprisonment, and a LOVE so powerful that it poetically transcends both life and death. I'm actually at a loss for words to describe how deeply moving I found this film to be.       Truly a wonderful and powerful film. It's in my top ten of all time, and I highly recommend it.    JM    p.s.    At the time of this review, the Piano has been released in Australia on Blu-Ray. Lots of negative reviews concerning the picture quality of the transfer. Let's hope we get a proper Blu-Ray release, SOON!

1586212222|1.0|Since when did the murder of a baby and two 10 year old boys become funny or even \\"dark\\" humor?  Not only were they murdered, but the two boys are murdered by a sex offender who was \\"given\\" the two boys as a Christmas gift by their parents in an attempt to \\"out-do\\" their neighbors!  The baby is murdered by a long lost daughter from vietnam who, after her step-mother asks her to \\"watch the baby\\", \\"WATCH THE BABY,\\" which is screamed at the listener again and again, promptly puts the baby in the washing machine and then into the dryer.  The stories are just bad...really, really bad.  Thankfully I checked this CD out at the library and I can say, I will not choose this author again.
B002ZG97EC|1.0|I have gotten this 2 times and each time the outer sleeve says that it includes the digital copy, but the internal casing is only for the Blu-ray and DVD.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I had no idea what was going on in the food industry. This documentary has really opened my eyes to what the very few companies controlling this system are doing and getting away with. I am upset that our government can be this corrupt. More people should see this documentary and realize what is going on. I am definitely talking to everyone I can about the issues presented. I have seen a few other documentaries such as \\"Supersize Me\\", and \\"Independent America\\", but the information shown has had much more impact on my knowledge and opinion on the food industry. I do recommend watching this documentary as soon as possible.
0545140323|4.0|I actually really enjoyed this. It is a really cute story. Although I did feel that the main premise of the story was something that I had seen before. Penny had been wronged by a guy and decided it was time to be done for them, at least for a while. Then she notices that she is getting a lot of attention from other guys. But, the overall story and the way that it is done, works. It is an empowering story.<br />I'm sure many girls no matter the age have felt like when a friend is in a relationship they tend to lose time with them. The Lonely Hearts Club shows girls coming together to be there for each other and grow as friends and not lose their own identity.<br />This is a story that I see myself reading again. I also look forward to seeing what else Eulberg has coming in the future.
B00005QBUK|5.0|I have tried many, many headphones and these are quite simply the only ones I can use without pain or having them pop out of my ear.  I have small ears, and no other headphones seem to work for me.  I was thrilled to find them on Amazon because I buy them in bulk when I see them at the local Best Buy, etc.  For the price, it's easy to stock up on them and I always make sure I have my next pair handy because as another reviewer noted, they DO wear out after a while.  They are not sophisticated, but the sound quality is good and they get the job done.  It's also easy to wipe the sweat off them during a run on a hot day, unlike earpieces that have a spongy cover where you never quite feel like you get them dry enough and end up with ears that feel \\"water logged.\\" I pray Sony never stops making these!
B000002J1Y|4.0|This was my first Yes album and I was hooked. Still have the vinyl but with some scratches. Incredible musical virtuosity and all of it 'live'. Everyone should have this in their collection. I eagerly awaited the remastered digital version but this has again confirmed for me that for all the advantages of digital the vinyl sounds better. I heard the difference immediately (couldn't help it after playing the original hundreds of time). Yep, it sounds harsh by comparison and something important is lost. Also, didn't appreciate that the count-in for Perpetual Change was put at the end of the previous track. When you want to hear a song you want to hear all of it. Makes no sense on a 'live' album to split tracks this way. This album deserves 5 stars but I'd reserve that for the analog version.
0131480057|5.0|bought this book after a lot of deliberation, certainly worth it , even though I havent gone through the entire book yet it feels like an interesting read with enough info to keep everyone happy. the authors have kept concepts plain and simple with no complications.

B004ASVS0E|5.0|In a world full of Christmas albums that sound pretty much the same, Annie Lennox has given us a singular recording indeed, a nice mix of well-known and less familiar Christmas songs delivered with her unique vocal stylings and musical arrangements.  It is difficult to explain the vocals on this album -powerful, focused, intense, and very well enunciated all come to mind.  This is one of those occasions when I wish I had purchased the CD rather than download the album online.  I understand that Lennox played a variety of instruments herself, but I have no way of knowing those details.  Make no mistake about it, though - Annie Lennox puts her own personal stamp on even the most familiar of songs, making the old new again with bold new arrangements, yet somehow staying true to tradition at the same time.  As a traditionalist myself, I usually have no use for anyone mucking around with the sounds of classic hymns and traditional Christmas carols, but I love what Lennox has done here.  It's uncannily pleasing.<br /><br />If you want to sing along to some Christmas favorites, this isn't your album.  I wouldn't really recommend A Christmas Cornucopia for parties or small gatherings, either.  This seems to me to be a Christmas album designed for quiet contemplation, with the hauntingly beautiful music almost demanding the listener's constant attention and concentration.  Many will love it, some will hate it, but none dare call it conventional or unassuming.  There is a mournful and reverent quality to every song.  I personally find inspiration in even the darkest of tracks, such as God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen and Lullay Lullay (Coventry Carol), but there is regal majesty in Angels From the Realms of Glory, quiet beauty in Silent Night, and wonder of various kinds to be experienced throughout the entire album.  The overall theme is one of hope and peace, a message which is epitomized in the final track, Universal Child, which Lennox wrote herself.  A Christmas Cornucopia is simply an amazing Christmas album like no other.an amazing Christmas album like no other.
1400079276|4.0|Previously I had read some pages of the \\"Dance Dance Dance\\" book of the same author and then decided to read this one.   The beginning is very exciting presenting a set of characters at least \\"exotic\\": a 15 years old boy who is tired of his life and running away from his school and his house, a weird story from the WWII time which brings the 65 years old man who talks with cats, this old man will be helped by a 20s (years old) truck driver, a 50 years old lady who is the director of a private library and manages an androgen 19 years old girl who is responsible of the day-to-day activities at the library.   The book presents a lot of japanese cultural traces: solitude, escapism, WWII related stories, a nature influenced culture, the close relationship with animals (cats, crows, etc) and a fantasy or dream-like recurrent scenes.  After the third quarter of the story, most of the characters and scenery were already presented and the story as a whole became quite predictable as it begins to converge. Even though, to be honest, the anxiety to reach the end of the story didn't vanish.
B000641D2Y|5.0|This is the perfect example of what makes John Hughes a legend. From the onset, we know we are in for roaring spectacular of epic proportions. McCauly Culkin is at his prime, delivering an Oscar worthy performance. Isn't it every little kids dream to be \\"home alone\\" in the big apple? It also has a stellar supporting cast, who could ask for more? What a film. You are missing out if you decline this purchase, and it's truly a bargain at any price!
0316069485|4.0|Sheesh!  I made the mistake of reading some other reviews preparatory to writing this and it turns out that the biggest objections are actually the reasons I liked \\"The Reversal\\".  The main objection appears to be that it is more of a procedural than a murder mystery.  That may be true but it doesn't make this a bad book; instead, it pulls back the curtain on courtroom processes about which most of aren't aware but maybe should be.<br /><br />We never really know why (but we suspect that it is a case of deniability) but the L.A. County District Attorney asks defense lawyer Mickey Haller to head up the re-prosecution of a 24-year-old case that has just been reversed based on DNA evidence. Even though the DNA evidence is shown not to be related to Jason Jessup, who was originally convicted, it is believed that he was indeed guilty and can be shown to be so in the re-trial. So Haller presses on with his ex-wife (and ace prosecutor) as second chair and his half-brother, Harry Bosch, as his investigator. It makes a taut team with deep undercurrents and strained dynamics.<br /><br />There are many who object to Connelly putting Haller on the prosecution side, but the truth is, he never becomes a prosecutor. At heart, he is still and always will be a defense lawyer and those instincts serve him very well in this one-off prosecution stint.<br /><br />I have two quibbles: Connelly could have done a better job of telling us (and explaining why) what evidence and previous testimony from the first trial could not be used or could only be used in part. That was hazy in places. Also, even though it had to be done in order to move the story forward, allowing Jessup free on own recognizance was a stretch and strained belief.<br /><br />Otherwise, it was an interesting and educational look at the judicial system.  And I thought the device of having Haller speak in first person for his chapters and switching to third person for the rest was just fine and served the story.

B0043D2LAC|5.0|Utility Bag is an aptly chosen name for this item. I have not yet put this bag to much field use, but I have tested it with a number of items. It'll readily hold two hot-shoe mounted flashes, a pair of medium size lenses, or a camera body. The bag is relatively tall, and will hold a long flash like a 580ex or a lens such as a 70-200 (tightly). There is not much to stop up-and-down movement of shorter items, so I would not necessarily recommend it over a pair of dedicated lens cases, for example. Nevertheless, it serves the purpose well of keeping a couple of spare items close at hand and protected from most hazards. I would note that the divider in the case, while removable, cannot be freely repositioned as only one pair of narrow velcro attachment strips are provided on the inside walls.    The pull-out all weather case covers most of the case, leaving only the center-back exposed to permit access to the sliplock tab or the metal d-rings. While there is no shoulder strap included, attaching one to the d-rings converts the bag into a convenient shoulder bag.    On the narrow sides of the bag, there is nylon webbing in which one may tuck-away the zipper ends. This webbing is of a size that it will double as a slip-lock loop, permitting other Lowepro products to be attached to the bag.
0312600844|5.0|This writing is so beautifully driven by the characters Franzen creates co-mingling with the landscape/time in which they live.  It is about the human experience and Frazen's gift is his ability to create fully complex, flawed people (and generations)  for whom I cared.      There are too many themes about the human condition within the book to be explained in a review - and I would suggest not being put off by negative reviews and not being scared away by the earliest pages - which I must admit - almost had me closing the book before I let myself get lost within it.    Are some of the characerizations too dramatic for certain readers to relate to? Perhaps - but these people DO exist -in multitudes.  Maybe one has to have lived for a time in some of the places within the book (the midwest, Virgina/D.C./Texas) to understand how very real these people are.      The only thing I wanted when \\"Freedom\\" ended was more. It did what all the best writing does - opens a world into which the reader enters more and more fully - and then leaves the reader sad that she can no longer inhabiit it.  What a ride!
0240816250|5.0|Like other reviewers when I first got this book my reaction was WOW!<br /><br />What an elegant book.  It in many ways walks a line between coffee table book (visual impact, size, print quality, and quality of the illustrations) and text book.  This book is stunning yet also drenched in technical detail.  Just reading the intro I remember why I love black and white and become motivated to dig out my old film cameras and explore with film again.<br /><br />This book is dedicated to the art of black and white film photography.  If you are shooting digital there are still many things to glean from this book however it is a book for film photographers.
0385342047|2.0|I have read (and bought) every Shopoholic book, so when I saw this one, I immediately got it. Becky compulsively lies in this book, to the people she loves and cares about the most. In previous novels, they were little white lies that normally brought hilarity, and no real consequence, but in this novel, she's lieing and scheming to her family and friends unecessarily, and without any thought as to their feelings. The character stalemates in this novel, she hasn't grown or matured. She doesn't have the same lovable sincerity as seen in the previous novels. I love Becky Bloomwood as a character, but by the end of this novel, I really wanted to just slap her.
0307454541|4.0|Good detective story, but nothing exceptional. I do sympathize with the girl, though. It is sad that she distances herself even from those few who care about her. I hope she overcomes it some time in the future. This free-to-sleep-with-the-best-friend-when-married concept is alien to me, but I accept it as different mentality/culture :)
B000JMKQX0|5.0|My buddy John Brownlee recommended World War Z after I told him about reading [[ASIN:B0042FZVX0 Kill the Dead: A Sandman Slim Novel]]. He told me he was reading WWZ and it was amazing and written by the son of Mel Brooks.  I am maybe halfway through the book but I am already sold.  It has captured my mind and my heart and also my dreams.  No nightmares yes.  This book isn't about Zombies at all, actually. Max Brooks is just using Zombies as a framework to hang our humanity out to dry.  The book is about cracking a lot of eggs in order to make a very small omelet in a future that might never happen.  What do people do?  There are reflections of Hitler and the Germans and how they behaved against the Jews, there are expositions on weakness and hubris and pride.  The book is both pro and anti individualism as each thing has a time and a place and nothing will survive The Panic if it is marinated in Hubris. What is survival instinct, what is selfishness, what is single-mindedness, what is leadership, and what is defiance? What an amazing novel.  It is all based on \\"interviews\\" with survivors of The Panic -- a global infestation of the undead who quickly take over much of the world.  Billions of living humans die globally. Sounds to me like only 50,000 folks of every culture seem to make it through, and these are their words.  Very well-played and completely convincing, especially if, like me, you're old enough to have lived through the Cold War and the real thread of nuclear annihilation.

B002JCSWVG|3.0|Invictus (2009) is the story of South African President Nelson Mandela's journey to unite his country through the sport of rugby when he was first elected. It's an important historical story for South Africa and the world. And yet in the hands of gifted director Clint Eastwood, I just didn't feel that importance in this movie. I wanted to get those same feelings that great sports movies like Hoosiers (1986), Rudy (1993), and The Blind Side (2009) convey. But something was missing from this effort. You could argue that Invictus isn't really a sports movie and that it's a character story about Nelson Mandela. But if it's not a sports movie, then what is it? Because its got an awful lot of sports in it. Maybe that's the whole problem with this film...it just doesn't know what it is. Sometimes that works for a movie, but not this one. I give it 3 stars out of 5.<br /><br />There is some filmmaking craftsmanship in Invictus that we see in the production design, cinematography, and acting for this film. Although the cinematography seems a bit underwelming compared to Eastwood's other films of the past decade. What I think this film is mainly lacking is direction and story/plot. I never felt like the movie was really going anywhere other than where I knew it was going...a big win on the rugby field. But that wasn't enough to give me the payoff I was looking for. And while Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon try to convey aspects of who their characters are, I just didn't connect with either character. They felt too forced. I did think Morgan Freeman was completely believable as Nelson Mandela, but I didn't care enough for his cause. Maybe I needed to understand more of the pain and experience of his imprisonment and the country's racism to feel passionately about what he was up to as President? I'm not totally sure what more could be done with this story. I just know that it didn't connect with me like I hoped for. But the film is worth watching at home on DVD/Bluray or on one of the premium movie channels where I saw it recently. It's not a bad movie by any means, but it struggles to rise above its mediocrity as just a \\"good\\" film.emium movie channels where I saw it recently.

B003L20ICO|3.0|It's rare that I find a movie with a good adult laugh. My sense of humor is pretty dry, and most comedies nowadays seem to go more for toilet room and slapstick humor. But I was very pleasantly surprised by the intelligent, subtle, witty humor in The Kids Are All Right (2010). The film also has a good dose of drama, so it's really a dramedy that follows in the footsteps of the great television series M*A*S*H, combining laughs and tears with great effect for both. I'm shocked that I like The Kids Are All Right as much as I do! I was expecting it to be light and fluffy. And at times it is, but it also has great dramatic depth. I give the film 3.5 stars out of 5, and highly encourage you to check it out. It's one of the best and freshest films of 2010, as so many critics are pointing out.<br /><br />Director Lisa Cholodenko crafted this marvelous story about a modern family with two kids and two mothers from her own life experience, as is clearly obvious in the phenomenal writing and dialogue. Annette Bening and Julianne Moore are absolutely perfect and believable as a Lesbian couple who both get pregnant using the same sperm donor, and create their family of four. Mark Ruffalo plays the sperm donor and hopeful-father-to-be for Laser and Joni, played brilliantly by Josh Hutcherson and Mia Wasikowska. All five of these actors that make up this ensemble cast are at the top of their acting games. Bening and Moore both deserve Oscar nominations for their work here. Other than in American Beauty (1999), I've never seen Bening better. And I predict she finally wins her much deserved Oscar for her role as Nic in this film. The production design and cinematography are both excellent, showing how much can be done on what I'm sure was a tight budget. The sets and locations all work well in telling the story of the lives of these characters.<br /><br />What really got me in The Kids Are All Right, is how much I could see myself and my own life's journey in each and every one of these five characters. Regardless of their gender, age, or sexual orientation, each character has a piece of life to share with us and make us think and feel about. This is very much a family film, but without a pretentious agenda (I would argue) to promote or prove that gay and lesbian couples can have a marriage and a family just like straight couples. And yet it does prove that premise...at least to me. The love, structure, struggles, and all the other things that any family or marriage has, are all present in this family. The two major scenes where these five family members gather around the dinner table and have a \\"family\\" meal together are the absolute best parts of this movie. Each time, I felt fond memories of my own family's meals and the dynamics involved in the conversations between the people present. It's good stuff!! It's hard for me to share what got me about this film, other than all the little details and minutia of everyday life that come through in the characters and the story. They all add up so that by the end, you've gone on this journey of discovery about this family and the lives that make it up. As well as relived your own story. I remembered my own past experiences with growing up as a teenager, going off to college, learning about life, and maturing into an adult as I watched this film. I laughed at some of the obscure, ordinary, but funny moments that this film lives in.

B00198X0WW|2.0|I saw The Mission when it was first released in the theater and was moved by the drama as well as the lyrical score by Ennio Morricone and the sumptuous visual production and sound. I have purchased this film in every format that it has been released in except laserdisc. As home video technology improves, I guess I am always searching for the ultimate reproduction of the experience I received in the theater upon its original release. I even sold my DVD copy in anticipation of this blu-ray release, and now wish I hadn't.    OK, the movie is still the same--a uniquely serious Hollywood examination of pacifism and war. Screenwriter Robert Bolt's dramatic treatment of two characters who both have critical reasons for following their opposite paths is as sensitive and timely today as it ever was. Robert DeNiro, who never quite manages to convince us that he is not from New York, nontheless delivers a powerful performance as a Spanish warrior and slave trader who seeks redemption by becoming a man of the cloth after killing his own brother. Jeremy Irons is the Jesuit missionary who tries with nonviolent resistance to protect the native people of Paraguay from enslavement and slaughter. Between them is the archbishop who must balance the ideals of the church with the political realities of trying to hold competing elements of Christendom together. The film is a special one with a complex interplay of ideas and deserves the best possible transfer, which unfortunately it does not get in this release.    The picture is reasonably sharp, but the colors are less brilliant than in previous releases. The film has no doubt aged, but the recent DVD release looks more brilliant than the blu-ray. The blu-ray simply doesn't pop like the best HD transfers do. The blacks are grainy and the contrast is mostly dull. A real disappointment.    As for the sound, there are no options but a flat DTS-HD rendering. At first I thought the film had been mastered in monaural--everything seemed to be coming from my center speaker. In fact, it is surround, but I had to roll the center channel way down to hear any separation, and the rears have to be cranked way up to get any appreciable surround effect. Upon its first release, The Mission had a reference quality sound design, and the scene at the beginning when an unfortunate missionary is crucified by the natives and floated over the waterfall sounded stunning and enveloping in both VHS and DVD, giving my subwoofer some work to do. What happened to the blu-ray? It sounds lifeless. If nothing else, Morricone's score deserves much better. Blu-ray viewers have come to expect the best.    I will always give the original film five stars, but not this disappointing blu-ray. Usually Warner Brothers does much better than this. The Mission received a stunning DVD release some years ago in a deluxe package, but the blu-ray package looks like an afterthought. The only real extra is the same documentary that was included in the DVD. It looked bad on DVD and looks even worse on blu-ray. The Mission was never a blockbuster hit, but has a faithful, serious following and deserves better. One day it will undoubtedly be remastered--it certainly should be--and I'll have to buy it again. Maybe that was the point of this release.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|I regret the decision to watch this online before seeing it at an IMAX theater. The SFX are impressive enough without it but I can just imagine how mind-blowing it would be to experience the film in that format - especially when viewing it for the first time.     As many other reviews have stated, this is a mind-bender. I thoroughly enjoy a story that draws you in and demands your full attention to keep up with the details because you don't want to risk getting left behind.     You need to be able to think outside the realm of what is typical and tangible, and concentrate on trying to keep track of a series of events that appear to be reality mixed with others that seem impossible. What might at first seem to be a barrage of unrelated, mundane, confusing or abstract elements are critical parts of the final outcome.     It may sound like a strange comparison, but I was reminded of movies like Donnie Darko. The story continually makes you question what is real ... what might happen if the characters choose a different decision or course of action ... and what is it all leading to?

B000005JA8|5.0|I repeat, this music is essential.  No ironic perspective, no understanding of rock & roll, no understanding of art in the 20th century is possible without it.   This (these) record(s) (and indeed 98% of all the Captain and his musicians' work) deserves 10 stars - and the Captain and his redoubtable musicians deserve our richest encomiums as true cultural explorers, fulfilling the promise of the modernist experiment while rocking the house with that joyful off-kilter floppy boot stomp.  This is why virtuosity counts.  If you weren't there, check out any film you can find of their late 60's - 70's primeval dada blues period - wow - skill and abandon.  Absorbs the lessons of Coltrane, Moondog, Howlin' Wolf, Wallace Stevens, Jackson Pollock, Crazy Horse, psychedelic/peace revelation and Eeeee-lectricity.  This music lives where the human spirit soars.
B000FCKBCU|3.0|The Undomestic Goddess is a fun summer read. It starts out slow but quickly picks up. It has a lot of funny light hearted parts and some serious ones. It took me a few days to finish i rated it ok. It wasn't a book that i would consider a \\"can't put it down\\" read, but it was a hey i'd kinda like to know what's going to happen even though i can kinda guess already. Having read Sophie Kinsella's other works, i would say that it's a fair assumption that you will like it if you liked her other books.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Ok, I'll say a bit more.  This is one of those classic albums that will stand the test of time for many more decades.  While every song on this album is nothing short of great, I've been in the habit lately of starting with track 6 \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" and letting it play all the way to \\"The End\\" and rolling into the final 26 seconds of \\"Her Majesty\\"  Knowing the history of this album (it was the last recorded material The Beatles did, not the last album released - that honor belongs to \\"Let It Be\\"), it's amazing that during the time of a breakup, they have created a masterpiece. Only one other album comes to mind - Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumors\\" - where there was so much conflict that created some incredible music.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This is the first book that i had read of Sophie Kinsella. It was so good that i wanted to read anything she wrote and i have since then and most if not all were just as good if not better. I don't want to give any parts away but i will say that it is a book you must read if you believe in true love at first sight.

031603438X|4.0|Keith could have taken his multi-million dollar advance, had James Fox write a 200 page book, include a few never before seen photos and still had a run away best seller. Like with his music, Keith cared about the product and has given fans and history 500+ pages of what appears to be an honest rendering of about 50 years of his life (the last 10 - 15 years are very sketchy). Fox is credited, but the voice is clearly Richards', either a result of Fox's coaching and editing of Keith, or if Fox wrote it, his ability to render a credible voice for Keith.<br /><br />Child and young adulthood are the most cohesive parts.  As Keith's life sprawls, the book does too.  He presents his warts (addiction, legal troubles, the destructive relationship with Anita, etc.) in a self knowing fashion, sometimes, he analyses. Other disturbing aspects of his life (the upbringing of Marlon, the dumping of Lil, or the smashing of his guitar upon meeting future in-laws, flinging a knife, etc.) are told without reflection, as though they are isolated inconsequential acts.<br /><br />There are a lot of people and events. The time is not fully linear, nor are people mentioned in what is seemingly proportional to their roles in his life.  Manager Jane Rose, previously unmentioned, just appears and serves a very intimate role, assisting Keith in withdrawal. He seems to be close to his mother, but after Keith's childhood, all the time that she is raising Keith's daughter Angela (who also is hardly mentioned), she has only a few cameo mentions until her death. Most band members take a back seat to others such Freddie Sessler and Bobby Keys.<br /><br />The parts that are probably of the greatest interest to fans are those that describe the Jagger-Richard dynamics. While the roots of the problem might be discerned at a distance, the examples of disagreement and style are fleshed out with examples.<br /><br />Those not living through the early 60's when long hair was considered a moral offense may not understand how radical Keith's appearance was for its time. Keith provides some interesting insight on how drugs were not always illegal.<br /><br />There are some unvarnished sections showing from the inside how the music industry and the criminal justice system make way for money making/fan producing stars. The Stones were well lawyered and while this not always a deterrent, Keith shows how the rules are bent for the rich and famous.<br /><br />The book has something like \\"guest authors\\" who describe episodes. They are of mixed value, with some of them, such as the last one of Dr. Andrew Law really adding perspective. This way of presenting what in other books might be footnoted material is new to me. It has nice informality and I expect we'll see more of this in the future.<br /><br />This is a necessary read for fans and an interesting read for others with interest in this band and its music.th's appearance was for its time.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|My brother and I enjoyed this TV series so much we decided to purchase it. Action, adventure, and humor is what makes this series  fun to watch.The crew goes to a lot of trouble to do a job and get paid.The cast of characters is great and I wished they'd made more episodes.
B000UJCALI|1.0|Kubrick was so good with Barry Lyndon, and other work, but The Shining was really disappointing, and it could have been so good, with the talent involved.  But Jack's wife(as portrayed) was, imo, ridiculous, not at all how King described, opposite even....there wasn't much sex in the book, but what there was was well described, imo, why totally delete? and that stupid thing with the Finger? I'm not  King fan, but The Shining(book) I did like, King finally writes about something he has personal knowledge of (alcoholism), instead of simple off the cuff imaginings, the only work of his that has ever rung true for me.  &#34;Carrie&#34;, w/ that idiotic upside down punctuation..give me a break, altho Sissy Spacek was good, as always.<br /><br />Read The Haunting by Shirley Jackson, you'll see what I'm trying to say.<br />This movie could have been so good.<br /><br />I would suggest renting before buying.  The flic wasn't awful, it just could have been so much better.  What was great in 2001 and Barry Lyndon doesn't work here, Kubrick fans will be shocled, IMO.<br /><br />PS...I generally don't summarize plots, I just review, and say whether I liked or didn't like.  I'm hoping to sway positively or negatively or neutrally, with evidence, as I would hope to be, when considering shelling out the bux.<br /><br />6/2015 Update....got The Shining &#34;free&#34; w/ a 4-pak Kubrick special DVD set, tried to watch a second time, just couldn't do it.  Couldn't stand Duvall paging thru &#34;All work and no play......&#34;  ad nauseam, Kubrick missed the plate on this one, changing to 1 star....Shelley Duvall stinx out loud.
030746363X|5.0|I don't know if it the weight of this book or the amazing amount of material inside, but even just popping it open a few days ago, I've began to see some changes on my body.

B002ZG999U|5.0|This movie doesnt make any apologies for not being a \\"Bourne Ultimatum\\" or a \\"Matrix\\" type of movie. But what it does have is wall to wall action,and its very well done. It certainly is realistic enough not to be a movie where one guy walks into town and turns into a one man wrecking crew! It shows what a team can do together, and it tons better than the \\"A Team\\" movie was earlier this year. As of this writing, Stallone and Lungren were cruising the scenery in Mexico for a sequel to be released late next year.These guys really earn their money in this movie. The action scenes are incredible especially when Stallone and Statham , after escaping from a battalion of mercenaries, destroys a pier along with a couple dozen of those bad guys. Pretty ingenious from the air in fact. Incredible!! As with most action movies, the dialogue is a little better than the average action movie. I highly recommend this movie, and I cant wait for the sequel.
B001P5Q6FC|5.0|I always know an album will be good when I only \\"like\\" it the first time I hear it but something \\"nags\\" me about it that I can't quite put my finger on.  And whatever that is brings me back again and again as the album gets better and better.  I also never tire of listening to Wrath and can always listen from start to end at any time. Thus, this is one hell of a great bunch of songs that should be in every fan of the genre's collection.
B002ZG99NG|4.0|There's something to be said about The Town, most of which lies with director/co-writer/star Ben Affleck, and what's to be said is that he has risen above his mistakes in the past in terms of career choices.  Anyway, Affleck stars as Doug, a career criminal who after pulling his latest heist with his lifelong and loyal pal Jem (Jeremy Renner) strikes up a romance with the bank manager (Rebecca Hall) he just robbed, while seeking to learn whether or not the FBI and the determined lead agent (Jon Hamm) know anything about him and his crew.  While the theatrical cut runs a bit too long (and the extended cut of the film is practically self-indulgence), The Town is a gripping and surprisingly adrenaline charged film that boasts some of the best work to come from Affleck in years acting-wise, and it shows that as a director he has a keen eye for ultra-compelling action scenes.  It doesn't pack that same kind of punch that Affleck's directorial debut Gone Baby Gone did, but it leaves a lasting impression regardless, even if its slightly upbeat ending (much different than the ending to \\"Prince of Thieves\\", from which the film is adapted) kind of betrays everything that lead up to it.  Still, The Town is a worthwhile endeavor regardless, and wholeheartedly worth your time.
B000SJDW3A|5.0|My son recently bought a turntable and wanted some Led Zeppelin albums.  I bought them used and they were exactly in the condition they said they would be in.
B000V6I7WG|5.0|A great movie, I own it on DVD, but it's a totally different experience when you watch it on Blu-Ray. It has a pretty original story, and it contains lots of action, drama, and thrill.<br />I highly recommend it.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Worked perfectly for my old Fujifilm camera from 2001.  I swapped out my old 128MB card for this 2GB card and could take tons of pictures on my vacation at the 3M setting and never came close to filling it.  I did not notice any speed improvement when taking pictures.  The biggest factor in speed for me is the battery quality.  Switching from cheap batteries to [[ASIN:B003EGVI7Q Kodak KudAA4 Ultra Digital Alkaline AA Batteries - 4 Pack]] made a huge difference, especially when flash turned on due to power drain characteristics between pictures to charge up for flash again.  So all that I saw was dramatically increased capacity (16X) which worked without a problem.  I couldn't be more thrilled.<br /><br />Definitely go to the Olympus website or your camera's website and check picture card compatibility.  The manual for my camera was out of date and only listed a max of 256MB and said nothing about these newer \\"M\\" and \\"M+\\" card types.  But a quick check on the Fujifilm website linked me to an Olympus compatibility site which listed a large table of camera models and support.  Some cameras require a firmware update to support more.  My old camera was listed as supporting xD M+ up to 2GB without a firmware update when some newer models than mine needed an update to go beyond 1GB.  It seems most support up to 1GB without a problem, and 1/2 support 2GB without an update, another 1/2 (minus a few) up to 2GB with a firmware update, and a few didn't support it.  Bottom line, check the online chart for compatibility first.  If it lists your model number and doesn't say anything about needing a firmware update, you should be fine.<br /><br />This is an excellent value and works perfectly (check your camera compatibility online, not the outdated manual).  I can't imagine any reason not to buy the max your camera supports if the price is very reasonable.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Tarantino is most definitely a cult director, producing films with a uniqueness which can alienate some viewers and impress others       Inglorious Basterds is not only Tarantino's finest work, but the one with the greatest range of critiques (the relatively even distribution among the Amazon ratings proves that).  It it difficult to write a review for this particular Tarantino film because it is all over the place.  Some are turned away from this; but I absolutely adore it.  Every single aspect of this movie was done wonderfully.  Tarantino obviously puts in major distractions in the film (such as a short 70's style action short, a hilarious 5 seconds slow-mo attack set to music, and Mike Meyers as a British officer).  He does this with such perfection and timing that I feel it is absolutely necessary to make such a masterpiece.    The opening scene will give you one of the most intense but mellow interrogation scenes.  Another reviewer stated that the lead SS officer is much like Hannibal Lecter in his demeanor, tone, and somber insanity without the cannibalism (though enough violence to make up for that loss).    I only buy movies when I feel it is something worth owning.  This film is a rare gem for me.  It is one big W.T.F movie yet supremely entertaining and in all regards, from the extreme violence to the masterful acting*.      I especially liked how he remained true to the foreign languages as most of the movie is in French and German with English as third followed by a dash of Italian.    *If you are not a fan of his style, you should watch the film for the acting alone.  I have never seen a better ensemble in any film.  The lead German SS officer (Christopher Waltz) will shock you in the way only a fine Shakespearean actor can (which he is).  Even Brad Pitt gave a stellar performance, best since Fight Club.
B003ES61EE|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moB89QJFOHBQBY]]This is a convenient marker-sized device with a retracting brush on one end and a felt-like pad under the cap at the other end.  Use the brush to easily brush away loose lint & dust.  Use the pad end for finger prints.  I think this is a neat compact kit that I plan to tote with me near my camera.  It even has a pen clip to easily clip onto something.  The brush works well and nicely retracts.  The cap covers the more sensitive pad used for finger prints and keeps it from getting grit, dust, oil, or other contaminants from getting on it.  I really couldn't expect more from a simple device.  It does what you expect.  I am very happy with it.  Be careful with any lens cleaning when rubbing with the felt end that there is no grit on it.  I only assume, like any lens cleaner, glasses or equipment, that if you rub on top of grit it will scratch.  This isn't for removal of caked on grit.  This is to brush away lint & dust, and remove finger prints with the padded end.  I assume to not use the padded end for any grit removal.

B00006FDCD|5.0|This is an older movie about a murderous clown and although its older it still surpasses the horror movies of today. There aren't any cheap effects in this movie is way passed its time. It's a mind and visual thriller. The book is great, the movie is great and if you don't have either in your libraries then you are missing out BIG TIME! After ordering this movie or reading the book you should look into getting more of stephen kings books such as red rose. It's a guarantee that you and everyone you know will love it for a movie night.
B000003TB6|5.0|Awesome album by the Roots. If you are a Roots fan, this is a must own. Next to \\"Illedelphia half life\\" this is one of their best work. A++++
B004EI3ON4|3.0|I have the same problem with this album as just about any other soundtrack:  The tracks are too short.  Typically, I expect that.  But when headlines are calling this Daft Punk's best \\"album\\", I'm expecting the tracks found on this album to be expanded or full versions of the tracks.  Even the tracks that have Daft Punk's traditional style and structure seem stuntingly short and abbreviated.  Like an album full of radio edits.<br /><br />If you loved the music in the movie as much as I did and was hoping for some expansion of these music themes, or to hear some source material, or any \\"inspired by\\" tracks, you won't find it here.<br /><br />What IS here, is quite solid, however.  It's just too abbreviated.  I'll look forward, instead, to further work from the duo that's released as an actual Daft Punk album.
1400052173|5.0|I'm an avid reader of many types of books.  I must say this is the most powerful book I've read in years.  The story of Henrietta Lacks must be shared..I can only read a few chapters at a time myself, so much reflection in between each chapter.  Although my Kindle says I'm about 40% into the book, it feels like I've digested a lifetime of real experiences. I've bought many copies for friends and family for XMAS.  I've Googled so much since starting the book, hope one day someone makes this into a movie.

0060853972|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a favorite author of mine and I admire Terry Pratchett work so I bought a copy of Good Omens with decent expectations. The phenomenal writing and quirky characters had me laughing out loud at the authors' satirical take on the apocalypse.     In Good Omens, Gaiman and Pratchett brilliantly combine their own unique writing talents to take shots at good, evil, Armageddon, and the anti-Christ. The story starts off with a reluctant anti-Christ child who is switched at birth and raised as a normal boy, thanks to a bumbling satanic nun who misplaces the boy at birth. The remainder of the tale centers on Armageddon and the people who try to stop it...the Hell's Angels as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse had me rolling on the floor. The protagonists, Crowley and Aziraphale, are now two of my favorite fictional characters.     This engaging story was full of excellent character development, zany humor and wit. Good Omens also raises questions about religion, philosophy, and humanity. Fans of either Neil Gaiman or Terry Pratchett will love this book, they are masterful storytellers and I heartily recommend it to anyone with a dark sense of humor.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|I don't like the main actor. However the movie tells a different story which first I disliked and then I liked. Because I think this is exactly what director wanted. And if not, I do like it anyway. I do wish it was longer and things were a little different in already changed scenario, with different cast. But what done is done. No one says that no one else will do a better clash of the titans in future.
B0041KOVNM|4.0|This album starts heavy, after the intro, and gets progressively lighter.  The Mercyful Fate comparisons are apt, but as I contemplated further what lept into my mind was that this album sounds like Blue Oyster Cult circa Cultosaurus Erectus & Fire of Unknown Origin.  BOC had a sinister, occult vibe for much of their career, but they didn't bludgeon you with it.  Their music was undeniably hard rock, but delivered, especially the vocals, with little menace.  Such is the case with Ghost as well.
0525423273|5.0|As a young, first year teacher I consider myself pretty in touch with contemporary Young Adult literature and what my students are reading. I picked up Anna and the French Kiss after YA author John Green raved about it on Twitter. I was in no way dissappointed.     Anna and the French Kiss is a beautifully written novel that captures the reality of relationships. They are complicated, messy and not always picture perfect. Perkins captures the voice of a girl struggling NOT to be the typical YA heroine who loses her sense of self in a love triangle. She is a smart girl who makes mistakes and learns from them. Anna is a refreshing and engaging character that young girls and women of all ages are sure to relate to. On a side note, Anna will also teach you somg great vocabulary along the way \\"callipygian--Having well-shaped buttocks\\" ;) A MUST read. Highly reccomended for all fans of the genre--teachers, teens and 20-somethings alike.
B003LPV960|5.0|No kids in our household, we usually watch the History channel, spike TV and action thrillers so this family fare holding our attention was a surprise.  Smart, clever and visually fun with colorful images and subtle magical touches thoughout telling of the fairy tale.  Charming. simply, charming.

B003L20IJW|3.0|Nanny McPhee returns did not work for us as well as the first Nanny story did.<br /><br />The movie lost momentum during long magical sequences where the film maker had multiple and extended scenes such as pigs flying and then without coming up for air going into a synchronized swimming routine - too long and does not add to the story.<br /><br />The story line became stale trying to wait out the exaggerated magic special effects.  The effects did not provide a satisfying subsitute for either the lack of interesting characters or the absence of a compelling story.  Why for example did the brother-in-law get himself into such a pickle during the war that caused him to need half the farm's value.  He goes bad with little screen time as to why or what kind of family the father's family is. The father is not someone we actually learn about during the movie beside being naturally the love interest of the mother.<br /><br />This movie would have benefited from better editing and a tighter script.
B002G1YPH0|3.0|My Asus motherboard has components near the CPU that prevented the mounting plate to install. I'm sure it would have worked great other than that.  I'll use it on the next build
030746363X|4.0|So I won't actually post the line here, but its line 1 on pg 238 - I have been laughing for 2 days from this one line and that's worth $20 to me. I haven't read it cover to cover but what I have read has been very informative, well researched and very entertaining. Other reviews have stated that they expected some completely new ideas from this book and I'm not sure why they expected this.  The title simply states that is \\"an uncommon guide\\" and it certainly is.    I love that Tim includes resources at the end of all chapters.  I love the idea of MED (Minimum Effective Dose), that is the smallest dose that will produce the desired effect.  Tim gives a perfect example - \\"To boil water, the MED is 212 degrees F.  Boiled is boiled.  Higher temp. will not make it more boiled.\\" Most of all I love Tim's pointed, yet completely relaxed style - ie. do this, exactly like this, but chill(and really you don't have to do it exactly like I did) and have fun with it.  And I love that its got enough info, ideas, and tests to keep one interested for a long time.     So yeah, buy it. or don't.  but you should.
B004ASVS0E|4.0|I totally love this cover! It's Sound of Music cheesy on purpose. And kinda creepy. Just like all her videos, solo and otherwise. She's clearly poking fun at the whole wholesome genre,( just like she poked fun at the whole un-wholesome pop music genre) never taking it all too seriously. I laughed my a** off when I really took the time to look at it. And please, who needs another Christmas album? They are countless and though some are gorgeous and sincere, most of them smack of \\"Hey, fork over the dough, Pal.\\" This one is unique, to say the least, and performed with impeccable musicianship and her customary passion for EXPRESSION. She takes whatever she sings to the soul. I'm tired of all the exhausted retreads. Kudos to Annie, even though I NEVER thought I'd buy a Christmas album and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw she had created one. The 1.99 price tag sealed the deal. I'd pay that much for the cover alone.
B001AQR3M6|5.0|Pierce Brosnan successfully portrayes a charming, intelligent, and somewhat funny James Bond. He is the best James Bond to me!!! He also has a good chemistry with Michelle Yeoh. I just love the way they always fight against each other in the beginning and fell in love with each other in the end. The bike chase in Vietnam (actually Bangkok) is definitely a great scene.     Michelle Yeoh is my favorite and best Bond girl. She literally can kick some butts and do stunts by herself.(this is unquestionable because she is a great martial arts actress back in Hong Kong). Yeoh creates a new Bond girl who is sexy (in a different way), independent, and strong but somehow feminine.     A must-see movie!!!!
030746363X|5.0|This is a great collection of insightful and useful information.  The writing style is such that the book is hard to put down.  Normally, I would see a book like this and shrug it off - thankfully, I gave this book a chance and am very glad that I did.
0525423273|3.0|So this book was pretty good. I'd heard about it from several online sources and decided to check it out after reading some of the Amazon reviews. I went in with no expectations and just decided to see where the story took me. The setting was wonderful. I love the boarding school in Paris and the romantic sights and sounds of the city. So I'll give it a star for atmosphere. The relationship, on the other hand, was a bit tepid. I do love reading YA fiction, and maybe I'm just used to authors making the teenage characters seem older than they really are by virtue of the dialogue, etc. But for some reason the characters in this book seemed a little too immature for me. I'm mean, aren't they almost 18 and getting ready to go off to college? In one scene, they're talking about each others' body parts like a bunch of middle school children, but then it's later insinuated that one of the couples is having sex, or doing some heavy hooking up, following an argument. So I was a little put off by the juvenile nature of their relationships. There really weren't any swoon-worthy moments either...just a little kissing and a lot of build-up to the kissing. Don't get me wrong, I love build-up! Some of my favorite romantic YA novels have made the build-up the best part of the story because of the tension and the little shared moments between the leads. But this one didn't do it for me on the romance front. So I give it three stars for a great effort, likable side characters and two cute kids as leads. But if you're looking for a YA romance that will warm up a cold, winter's day...this probably isn't it.
B0044KI7B6|3.0|Feels like there's different writers, and they haven't figured out what they are doing yet. It seems as if they just making it up as they go, and that's frustrating to me, instead of a slowly unfolding mystery it's more like confusion. I hope they are able to tie all of this back together because I really love this series, and would hate to see it end on a bad note. If they do decide to end the series after this season I hope they take the time to give closure on the loose ends, God, the war in heaven, that kid from last season who was so super powerful to name a few.
0684833395|1.0|A traditional \\"liberal\\" deconstruction where little is recognized as good with the exception of its own juvenile narcissism and egoism.  I would not describe this work as even a novel and it has little to recommend. Given that this is a critique of WWII, the novel puts in place the antecedents to today's antisemitism within the left's worldview.

B003UHYSIK|1.0|when this was 1st released on vhs back in the 90s i bought it then i bought it again but now its not what it used to be its so dated their is nothing much to it, they stand in the same place playing the same songs that they did on every dvd after this - when this came out it was something cool that they have made a live vhs cause all that were available just a song from london and that was live as well, but now its clearly a dvd to cash in cause they look tired in every other dvd
B000056JYC|5.0|I remember being 19 in college on a balmy, windless humid warm summer night in Charleston, South Carolina and drinking cheap whiskey on a porch overlooking a stunning view of stately churches, palm trees and amazing history. On either side of me were beautiful southern ladies wearing very little clothing, whose sweet southern accented words sent chills all the way up my body. Amid our drunkenness our friends and I would pass around ipods playing music. I was at the time a serious rock music aficionado, and used to spend my free time jamming out, and air guitaring to my favorite artists. I especially believed I knew every classic rock and metal band worth knowing. Boy was I ignorant.     My buddy discreetly threw on Peter Frampton's live version of Do You Feel Like We Do. Without ever having heard it before I kind of zoned it out and continued to hit on the lovely ladies next to me. About two minutes into the song I noticed a perfectly hit string of guitar notes massage my aural cavities.     \\"Who is this,\\" I asked my friend.     \\"Peter Frampton dude. It's awesome just you wait it gets so much better.\\"     About 5 minutes in Frampton threw out some absolutely mind-numbingly superb solos. I was mesmerized and immediatley lost interest in the attractive coeds around me and shifted into self-absorbed a state of musical ecstacy. My friend kept insisting it would get better. I couldn't believe it could get better...until the talk box solo. My god what a solo, it was like nothing I'd ever heard before (sure I'd heard talk box but nothing like this!). Frampton weaved his druggy guitar soloing masterwork to higher and higher heights. And it all climaxed in a last burst of rapid but perfectly melodic shredding fourteen minutes after it began.     I later found another friend with Peter Frampton about a week later and forced him to run through his Frampton selection including \\"Do You Feel Like We Do.\\" The music wasn't live however and I thought it was actually kind of lifeless. \\"Maybe it was just awesome because I was having a good time,\\" I thought.     Nonetheless, about a month and a half later I saw Frampton Comes Alive in a used record store for 11$. I thought what the hell and picked it up. When I put it on I was stunned. Peter was really just that much better live. He was fantastic in fact. Whereas his regular albums his peformance was merely average, live he JAMMED (something which is sorely lacking from modern day concerts) tastefully and injected his songs with a dose of pure rushing energy. Songs like Baby I Love Your Way and I want to go to the Sun pumped live, and his slower jazzier guitar work on songs like Lines In My Face is so emotional it can actually bring tears to your eyes. But the live version of Do You Feel Like We Do is the obvious highlight, and arguably surpasses \\"Freebird\\" and ties \\"Stargazer\\" for best guitar solo(s) of the decade. Damn could Frampton jam on stage. And his cover of the Rolling Stones' Jumping Jack Flash kicked serious buttocks.     About a month later I had sex to this song on full blast, feeling I had lost focus the night I heard it and missed out. That my friends was a complete sensual heaven. Buy it now!

B000ATQYT2|5.0|with my first child we would listen to the muppet christmas album (yes album) and many a xmas we enjoyed.  years later (9) my son was born and than the video came out and we would listen to the record and also watch the movie.  Now in 2010 I have the dvd and are watching it with my grand daughter.  so many wonderful moments and many more to come.  as one grows from child to young adult to grand parent  the muppets christmas carol never gets old.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This was the first movie that myself and my twin 5-year-old boys laughed at equally.  The adult humor is excellent and subtle at times that you really need to pay attention.  We just saw Tangled in the theater and one of my boy's said \\"mommy this is a good movie, but it is not as funny as Despicable Me.\\"  My children ask daily when we are getting a copy of the movie and I told them we have to wait and see if Santa brings it for them.  This movie was not hyped as much as Toy Story 3 which I did not like nearly as much.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Blu-Ray edition of The Sound of Music.  Extras are OK.  I really purchased it for the movie.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|First off, let me say that I am a huge fan of 'The Godfather' series, except for the 'The Godfather part 3' and I had the previous box set, which was quite poor with both picture AND sound quality, so when I heard that they were going to totally restore them, I was excited, but was kind of worried at the same time, because of not knowing what to expect, and what they would do to them, well, what they did, totally surprised me, in a good way too, not only did they remaster the picture and sound, but the colors have totally been brought to life, WAY more vivid and bright than they used to be, you can really tell this in the opening scene in the first movie, in Don Corleone's study, gorgeously remastered, and another thing that excited me about this set, is that 'The Godfather Part 2' the whole movie is on 1 disc, as on the previous release it was spread over 2 discs, which is kind of annoying having to get up in the middle of a movie to put the 2nd disc in to watch the rest of it, although the old VHS releases were like that, but that's understandable, so that is another thing that has been taken care of.    So, what you get, is a BEAUTIFUL outer box that is very nice, with four slim cases inside, which 3 of them are of course the 3 movies, and the fourth disc, wow, I haven't even gotten to that yet, you Godfather fanatics will be pleased with this, the fourth disc is 'Supplements' which is only available in the box set, not the individual releases which are available as well, but this set is the way to go, with the supplements, you get 2 discs, that have as follows, disc 1 has 'The Making of The Godfather' 'Addition Scenes' 'Filming Locations' 'The Corleone Family Tree' 'The Music of The Godfather' 'The Godfather Historical Timeline' 'Profiles on the Filmmakers' and photo galleries and storyboards, that is just the first disc, the 2nd disc is as follows 'Godfather World' 'The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't' 'When The Shooting Stopped' 'Emulsional Rescue Revealing TheGodfather' 'The Godfather On The Red Carpet' and 'Four Short Films on The Godfather' these 2 discs clock in at 291 minutes, so yeah, you get TONS of extras, and even the extras are in widescreen.    So if you have the previous set like I did, and are looking to upgrade, look no further than here, there was a lot of hype running around this set around the time it was going to get released, and this set really lives up to the hype, not only have the films been beautifully restored and cared for, but you get the extras you've always wanted, now you can buy the individual movies, but you won't get the supplements discs, but why buy the individual releases when it would only cost about $5.00 maybe $10.00 to get this set, but decide for yourself!

0061122416|1.0|This book is mystical.  If mysticism makes you feel good, then you will like this book.    Here are some quotes from the Alchemist.  \\"When a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream.\\"    The universe is not a conscious entity. One has to actively think about what he loves in life, ensure that it is a rational love, and pursue it himself.    \\"The future belongs to God, and it is only he who reveals it, under extraordinary circumstances.\\"    As if man has no free will, and no volition regarding his own future.    \\"Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from the Soul of the World, and it will one day return there.\\"    Never mind if your brain is telling you that your heart is wrong.  What if a woman's heart is \\"telling\\" her that she \\"loves\\" her abusive husband?    Mysticism is a dangerous drug and a horrible illusion.  For encouraging mystical thinking, I do not hesitate to give this book 1 star, despite any other 'good' aspects of the book.  Our culture needs a resurgence of reason, not irrationality and mysticism.    [...]
0451197968|5.0|I picked this book up, as a big fan of Stephen King, but wanted something short.  This was a great story, and ended up being one of my favorites by Stephen King.  If you want to read King, but don't have time for a 2000pg like The Stand or IT, the Running Man is a great alternative.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood is the only series that I've ever liked enough to buy on DVD. I was worried that it wouldn't be worth it, because I wouldn't watch it more than once. I was wrong. I love being able to watch my favorite episodes over and over. I will definitely be buying all the seasons.
1555175163|5.0|I've been involved in the Ip Man lineage of Wing Chun for years, and can whole heartily recommend this book.  I've passed it around to new students at our school, and even gave one copy away.  It's a very good source for a basic history of Ip Man Wing Chun, his life and his family.  It's short, and easy to read.  It also has numerous candid photos of Ip Man, historic places, his followers and family.  It's one of those books you'll find your self re-reading, or at least picking up to browse through all the pictures again and again.
0439023513|5.0|This is the third book in the Hunger Games series. If you have not yet started the series, do yourself a favor and just buy all three at once, because you won't want to wait! I absolutely loved everything about this book... a very satisfying read, but not predictable in the least!
1599218011|5.0|What a fantastic, well written and researched book!  I loved this book and it has greatly inspired me and permeated my brain in a way that I have already become a more conscious eater.  I love the way Kris writes, with humor and a lightness that helps digest some of the more scientific aspects of the book.  She lays it all out there and lets us make the decision, arming us with information, inspiration, tips and tools for us to take on a new adventure if we so desire- and I sooo desire!!!  She is never judgemental and allows us the permission to take gradual steps in our comfort zone and also comes from a place of knowing how hard it can be to make a drastic change for the better.  The empathy is there, right along with the kick-butt attitude and after reading I definitely feel able to make this change.  The 21-Day Adventure Cleanse is on my list for the new year.  Unlike other diets, fasts or cleanses, Kris adds a focus and an affirmation to each day to keep you on track; it's not just the food changes that are important but the the change needed in your mind as well.  The shopping tips and recipes are an added bonus!  She tells you exactly what she buys at the store and stocks in her fridge and pantry and why.  If you or someone you know wants to make a healthy change for the body, mind AND spirit - get this book!!!!

B004529NKM|5.0|You know how sometimes when you watch a sequel, you can't help but compare it to the original and think that the first one was so much better?  Step Up 3 is the exception to that rule.  Yes, it is the third movie in a series but it really could stand alone.  The plot is intriguing, the passion between the main stars is too hot for words and the dancing is unbelievable!  I don't normally watch movies more than once, especially in only a few days time and I've already watched Step Up 3 four times!  That's a new record for me.  I watched the regular DVD first and then watched the Blu-ray version and there was a huge difference!  The picture quality is so much better on Blu-ray and the screen seemed to come to life.  I enjoyed this movie so much and it would make a great gift for the holidays!<br /><br />One of my favorite features on this DVD is the music videos.  I put them on while I'm cleaning the living room and it makes the chore so much more enjoyable.  I catch myself dancing around the living room (not nearly as well as the dancers in Step Up 3 but I have a lot of fun anyway).  My second favorite feature is the documentary because it gives you new perspective and adds little details that are really enjoyable for the viewer.

B001P22HK8|4.0|I've never really been a fan of crime thrillers. Sometimes the mystery is enticing, but by and large, it always boils down to the motivation. Why did the killer do it? Most authors answer this as an afterthought. Whether it be an insane, megalomaniacal contrivance, or just plain avarice or one of the other seven deadly sins, they hardly explain or justify the events in the book. There are notable exceptions to this, such as John Connolly's notable Black Angel. Sometimes, pure mystery isn't enough---sometimes there needs to be a bit of genuine malevolence involved.     Daniel Suarez fills this niche with Daemon, a novel I can honestly say I couldn't put down. There is a certain amount of self-interest involved here. I work in IT, and it's always cool to identify with a tech-oriented protagonist. But what if the antagonist and most of the other characters are *also* fiendishly clever members of the computing underground, experts of cryptography, buffer overruns, and the hidden dangers of software conformity? What happens when the monster laying waste to the world is nothing but a trumped-up expert-system created by an insane genius to dismantle society and replace it with something he sees as its only salvation? Who do you root for in that instance? Do you get angry over a man who's more than willing to break a few eggs to orchestrate his righteous omelet, or everyone hurt by his machinations who just want to stop the killing?     This novel may not exactly explore what happens when the bad guy wins, but the ending clearly leaves effectively every question unanswered, with only a few vague hints as to the final outcome coming in subsequent novels. Suarez dispenses his revelations with such a miserly hand, literally one single plot-thread is tied, only to tangle it into the overall tapestry. The Daemon, despite its tendency to kill first and ask questions never, is stopping spam, blackmailing our corporate overlords, giving the dispossessed and forgotten a place in a society which was all too ready to discard them. So it has to kill a few federal agents and frame a completely innocent detective for their murder. What are a few feds compared to the fate of the world?     And The Daemon is obviously a villain, isn't it? A distributed, viral, ultimate root-kit designed to manipulate its agents like NPCs in the world's largest MMORPG. It threatens, it kills, it will seemingly stop at nothing to realize its ultimate ambition. We're supposed to believe it's making a better world, and where else but a massively multiplayer online game, is life so smoothly coordinated, excellence or dedication rewarded without risk of politics or jealousy muddying the picture? It's almost enough to seduce the reader into rooting for The Daemon in some instances.     That is what makes this such a great novel, that tiny amount of ambiguity capable of raising doubt in the reader over the villain's actual motivation. A genius who died of cancer just wants to use his intellect to save humanity from itself, no matter the cost. A man who saw online games not as entertainment, but powerful lessons in sociology, distributed topology, and perhaps a little immortality, and went a little overboard as cancer destroyed his mind. Or is it that simple? The government isn't exactly smelling like roses, more than willing to hack The Daemon for its own purposes; all software has some unnoticed flaw, after all. And more than one of the righteous is standing up to all of the Chaos it has sown, be it a redeemed identity-thief hacker, or a rogue NSA agent.     Daemon doesn't tell us. Not even a little. This novel just gets the ball rolling, distributing chaos and setting the scene, establishing just how screwed society is after The Daemon surreptitiously slithers its way into every major bank, corporation, and record-keeping system in the world. Will this ultimately be an end to civilization, or a new beginning? Maybe Freedom(TM) can provide the answer. I know I'll be readingit to find out.

B003YFIUW8|2.0|I applaud the creative attempt at the story being told from a 5 year old's point of view.  However, it came up short.  Some of the words were well beyond what a 5 year old could spell or ever use.  Sure, his mother had plenty of time to teach the kid vocabulary but it still gets ridiculous and silly.  I could not find myself believing it was a 5 year old.  Also, once the action is over, the book got old  and boring fast.  The babbling got so annoying that I couldn't quite finish the book.  Again, the story being told from a 5 year old's point of view was different and new, but it would have been much better if told from the mother's perspective.
B004132HZS|5.0|Love the way this version is so true to the mood of the original stories, including my favourite Holmes anectdote about neither knowing nor caring whether the earth goes around the sun or vice versa.  I use this in my own life and often quoted it to my maths-science students. Holmes follows the scientific method, which is usually horribly mis-interpreted by script writers and non-scientists as hunting for data and truth! Scientific method is never knowing anything; you use the existing theory as long as it is useful, and when you get a contradiction you first check that the contradiction is not an error, and if not you create a new theory.  There is no such thing as 'truth' or 'knowing', only theory.  'House' does that to an extreme. Holmes works with what he thinks it is useful for him to believe, and he doesn't waste time on other things - for his purposes it is sufficient that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west at knowable times.  For the same reason love the way Watson is the man of action, loyal and dependable.  I have enjoyed all the film Holmeses and Watsons for different reasons, but often thought the scriptwriters sold Watson short. The recent (Jude Law) film didn't make that mistake, and neither does this. Also the way Watson is very interested in the opposite sex, and could be sentimental, specially around women.  All of this is the great foil for Holmes, who is however bested by 'the' woman.  If I have a criticism it is that they are a little too slow, and knowing the original stories, it is easy to guess whodunnit, but that too is true to the original stories. They don't contain the wonderful Agatha Christie style red herrings designed to keep you in the dark until a few minutes before the end. You work out theories with Holmes. His secretiveness ensures you have to wait to see if you and he agree.  And finally, genius craves recognition, and can stifle from lack of it, and Watson provides Holmes with the audience, just as he did in the original stories. More!  More!
B0000027I6|5.0|I love this music.  What David Gilmore and Roger Waters created during the glory days of Pink Floyd is comparable to watching Michael Angelo paint.  It is something that will live throughout the ages.  I loved Amused to Death when my wife bought it  but, we lost the CD.  We didn't hesitate to buy it again.  Actually, this is the fourth time we bought the CD.  For some strange reason the CD keeps getting lost.  I love the music.   This was one of Roger's first solo creations after the PF split.  It's way better then David's try in my opinion.  I gave the CD a five star rating, and strongly believe that is where it belongs.

0312370849|5.0|This was the type of book that I couldn't put down as soon as I read the first page. It was interesting, compelling, and I learned a lot about the holocaust era. I wasn't too thrilled with the chick-flick love story at the end, because that kind of took away from the larger meaning of the book, but that's okay. This is a great book to read for anyone.
B004EDH4OY|1.0|Some one really had poor judgment to release this with the way the vocals are maybe one or two songs might have been okay but her warble or what ever you want to call it ruined it for me track 9 is only one with a straight vocal.
B000UMXCTY|4.0|This set contains all the original album recordings on individual CDs. The sound quality is very good. There's a bunch of comments here about whether to buy remastered recordings or if the packaging on the album is good.    In truth, if you're just looking to get S&G's albums as a set, this is great value.    As for the actual music... some songs haven't stood the test of time well, and it's interesting to see how S$G adapted to changing tastes and styles over the years. That said, Simon is one of the great songwriters alive and this contains much of his finest work.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Let me start by saying i was just a casual MW2 gamer with a bluetooth earpiece. I was reluctant in getting a headset because i had already dropped 50 dollars on the earpiece, but after many situations in MW2 where i noticed my opponents in my killcam freezing in there tracks and going the opposite way only to gun me down or knife me in the back. I would be like, how did they know i was there? This is when i decided to upgrade to this fine piece of equipment, The TURTLE BEACH PX21.         I have owned this headset for a little over 3 months now with no problems what so ever.  Averaging anywhere from 2 to 4 hours of gameplay mon-fri and 4-8 on weekends. So its safe to say that i use them plenty and i have had no problems until now.    Performance:  For a stereo headset i have to say it is one of the best on the market. I have heard the tritton ax 180, and the tritton ax 720 and this is on the 720´s level.  The sound is awesome on COD MW2, clip changing, gun fire, grenades, everything sounds great.  You get a sense of the battlefield, you hear where gun fire is coming from, and you definitely hear enemy footsteps (no ninja pro).  Countless times i would stop and listen for a second and pinpoint my enemy just by hearing the action. Like i said earlier i was just a casual gamer, that was until i got this headset, i repeatedly get high kill/death ratios thanks to this piece of equipment, making me a formidable COD player. Thanks to this headset i have achieved multiple 30 plus kill with 5 or fewer deaths (Team deathmatch) with this headset. I am currently playing Bioshock 2 with it and the speakers sound just as good.  The only game i thought was lacking was Assassins creed 2, the game sounded great but the voices sounded distant and echoey. All in all the headset performs as it should, producing excellent stereo sound.     Setup: Short and sweet, whoever says its difficult probably still has trouble sending a text message.  I installed it and had it up and running in less then 5 min. The only drawback is that the wires magically get tangled, but thats a minor issue.    Value: At the current amazon price of 65 dollars you cant go wrong, i paid 80 and have no regrets.  Worth every penny.    Final thoughts: If your serious about your gaming, especially competitive online multiplayer then it should be a no brainer \\"This headset is a must own\\". I almost forgot, the mic is pretty damn good according to my teammates who say i sound crystal clear.  So thats a wrap.  I hope this review is helpful, HAPPY GAMING.
0618918248|5.0|[[ASIN:0618918248 The God Delusion]] What will be the beauty of a maid and one might be fancied how to describe it in adequate terms? By using either the more common expression: \\"By God, what a gracious example of creation\\" or by the more sophisticated sentence: \\"By Darwin, what a beautiful specimen of evolution\\"? One will have to throw a glance at St. Thomas Aquinas to find an answer. With regard to heretics the Church Father recommends that \\"... they deserve not only to be separated from the Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from the world by death\\" and - some lines later in his Summa Theologica II-II, 11,3 he suggests that the Church \\"delivers him (the heretic who remains stubborn at the first and the second admonition, remark) to the secular tribunal to be exterminated thereby from the world by death.\\" What, however, should be more astounding than these very well known fierce announcements seems to be his line of argumentation. The \\"Pastor Angelicus\\" (Angelic Tutor), how St. Thomas is charmingly called by his admirers, argues: \\"For Jerome commenting on Galatians 5:9, `A little leaven,' says: `Cut off the decayed flesh, expel the mangy sheep from the fold, lest the whole house, the whole paste, the whole body, the whole flock, burn, perish, rot, die\\"([...]). One may feel reminded of the weird parable of the vintage (John 15:1-9) insinuating a similar crude sense of naturalism. So when theists try to explain a merciful God they very often retort to a biological notion of what the word culture may mean. Therefore, it can be suggested, there will be no difference: \\"By God, what a....\\" and \\"By Darwin, what a...\\" is just the same. Thanks to \\"God/Allah\\"and his fervent adherents all over the globe and after having read Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion, however, one will gradually come to appreciate the latter phrase: \\"By Darwin, what a beautiful specimen of evolution!\\" Emil Zajic, Klagenfurt.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I´m gonna make this short and sweet. If you play shooters you know how horrible the L2 R2 buttons are (Borderlands, Bioshock, among others).  This is the solution. Extremely comfortable and well made.  I changed my button layout on COD MW2 so L2 R2 would be my aim and shoot buttons and i never looked back with these attached.  They won´t make you the best COD player but you do get a better feel for the game with these triggers.  They did help me out, especially when i would encounter more then one enemy, the shooting with R2 just felt more natural.      All in all, buy this product. You will not regret it.  10 out of 10.
0439023513|5.0|Dystopia, Big Brother and post-apocalypse are themes that have been included in novels so often that it could well be a life's work for a librarian to prepare an exhaustive catalogue of titles. But, in terms of quality, the devil is in the details and Suzanne Collins has justifiably taken the world by storm. Suzanne Collins HUNGER GAMES trilogy, inspired by the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur, is an innovative, dare I say unique, young adult twist on the recurring themes of violence, cruely, despair, privation and revolution that are the mainstays of these types of novels.<br /><br />A distant future North America, now called Panem, is divided into 12 distinct economic districts ruled with an iron fist from the Capital located in the northwest Rocky Mountain region of the former USA. Every year, in a bizarre celebration called \\"The Reaping\\", the Capital \\"honours\\" each district by selecting two children that will be called \\"tributes\\", one boy and one girl, to participate in the Hunger Games. The 24 children are released into a wilderness arena and are expected not only to survive but to battle one another to the death. The last remaining child is returned to his or her district as a conquering hero.<br /><br />The games, reminiscent of Rome's bloodthirsty gladiatoral combats, are televised as an extravaganza throughout Panem on a minute by minute basis. Carefully engineered from start to finish, the sculpted terrain of the \\"arena\\" might be anything from arctic or forest to desert or rugged mountains; an unknown supply of weapons and supplies are provided but will have to be fought for and \\"won\\" as part of the entertainment; the games are replete with intermittent technologically engineered disasters such as fires, teeming rainstorms, rogue waves, insect infestations or earthquakes; genetically engineered humans or animals called \\"muttations\\" are periodically released to provide extra challenge for the tributes or extra entertainment for the viewing audience.<br /><br />When Katness Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, the tributes for District 12, jointly won the Hunger Games and inadvertently embarrassed the President of the Capitol, Panem became a tinderbox of anger and dissatisfaction and the firestorm of revolution was but one careless tossed match from ignition. Against all odds, when they survived a second Hunger Games which President Snow had created in an obvious attempt to rid himself of that focal point and symbol of an incipient uprising, the tinderbox ignited and full scale war between the Capitol and the downtrodden districts blazed into an all-consuming inferno.<br /><br />MOCKINGJAY, Suzanne Collins' brilliant conclusion to the HUNGER GAMES trilogy, graphically showcases the horrors of war - loss, heroism, courage, death and destruction, bravery, leadership - and injects horrific new meaning to the \\"terror\\" in \\"terrorism\\". Her depiction of the aphorism \\"Power corrupts but absolute power corrupts absolutely\\" is spellbinding. And, of course, she shows us that even one person acting according to a well-defined moral compass, refusing to bow to the dictates of corruption and dictatorship, can make a difference. The ending of the story, while somewhat more complex, less straightforward and considerably less clear cut than many readers would have liked, demonstrates that the world is filled with shades of gray and that decisions such as the ones that Katniss has to make in moving her life forward are rarely simple in real life.<br /><br />THE HUNGER GAMES is powerful reading and may be disturbing to the youngest readers. But, for mature young adults, looking for reading that is both compelling and challenging, this stunning trilogy will provide diversion, education and plentiful fodder for meaningful discussion for many, many years to come. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weisserdeen and Peeta Mellark, the tributes for District 12, jointly won the Hunger Games and inadvertently embarrassed the President of the Capitol, Panem became a tinderbox of anger and dissatisfaction and the firestorm of revolution was but one careless tossed match from ignition.

B0000004WM|2.0|Bought this old school Euro-pop 80s cd from the Fox for just one song, her Hurt Me Hurt me song.  It is so dated and so 80s.  Full Force produced this track and it is still fun listnening to it.  Eyebrow raising and finger popping fun!
1440503257|5.0|Arrived earlier than expected! Haven't had a chance to really look through but the detail of the book is awesome! The pages have a unique look, and overall I think it makes a perfect gift for any Harry Potter fan (:
B003TML0VO|5.0|Santana never disappoints.  Great fusion of music with old rack tunes.  Some of the artists I do not particularly like.  My favorite is India Arie's rendition of Why My Guitar Gently Weeps.  Really worth having in your collections.
030746363X|5.0|At 550 pp and pushing 3 lbs, this is not just a book, its a bible.  Timothy always delivers excellent value in his books, videos and blogs, with each page bringing another nugget - getting the job done, with the most efficient effort- in the least amount of time. His online  references add almost as much info again.  If you follow his blog, much of this has been there. But now the wealth of info is in one place with the logic and proof.  I can testify that his strength gaining workouts really work. He is also very generous with references to the experts in all fields.  If you have a Kindle this is the book to get on it - and then its with you everywhere.  Great vacation read, plus each section stands on its own.
B003405MF6|5.0|Liked Jeff Beck back in the 80s.  His guitar instrumentals are still kicking.  Nice that he diversifies his genre a bit on this album including a fantastic rendition of a famous opera aria called Nessun Dorma.  Believe me when I tell you this guy is the best at what he does.  Fusion and guitar licks with pop, opera, soul is just phenomenally good music!  Joss Stone sings 2 songs on this album as well and she pulls off a rock voice that seems to invoke a little Janis Joplin along the way.

031603438X|5.0|Although Keith Richards wrote Life with assistance from his friend, James Fox, it is apparent to me that, based on having seen and read a number of TV and periodical interviews with Keith, this work is in his voice.  His rendering of his formative years, the process of learning the blues and writing songs in a new musical idiom (rock), the explanation of open tunings used on virtually all of his playing and the interpersonal tension, drama and dynamics of being a seminal rock musician is lucid, forthright, unapologetic and compelling.  Keith understands and clearly describes the context in which he came of age and how his playing style and lifestyle evolved.  The juicy anecdotes about drug procurement and busts and use, as well as sexual escapades and other sundry mishaps are told in a wry, non-boastful tone, and I laughed out loud at a number of them (for example, his fling with Marianne Faithfull while Mick was having it off with Anita Pallenberg on the set of Performance: \\"While you're missing it, I'm kissing it!\\").  I hugely appreciated what an excellent collaborator Keith has been in his musical career, and how this has been responsible for some exceptional music.  It is clear that the interpersonal bonds he has forged in his life are as important as the music.  Some of Keith's portrayal of his attitude in the face of harassment by police and DAs in various locales is a little flip and self aggrandizing, but not to an extent that compromises the quality of the book.  And he does have a point about insecure authority figures needing to make an example of high profile flouters of prevailing social norms (more power to the flouters!), and how often they screwed up their plans to nail him.   In all, a thoughtful, honest, heartfelt account of the life and role of one of the musical cornerstones (along with Charlie Watts) of the Rolling Stones.  Highly recommended, one of the best musical autobiographies I've read!
0920668372|5.0|I grew up with my Mom reading my this book. I love it and still know the words. \\"I'll love you forever, I'll love for always. As long as I'm living my baby you'll  be.\\" <3
B002ZG99QS|5.0|There's plenty to say about how \\"Tron: The Legacy\\" contributes to \\"Tron the Phenomenon,\\" and other commentators have said far more on that topic than I would ever attempt. That leaves my own opinions to discuss - fortunately, I'm well equipped in that area.<br /><br />The visual experience comes across as intense and demanding: dark atmosphere with people wearing unexplained, glowing printed circuitry. That leaves plenty of expressive range, however, from Clu's beetle-helmed henchmen, to the sterile sexiness of the white-clad \\"Sirens,\\" to Zuse's manic manner. The arcade-game illumination got plenty of help from the exceptional sound track, too. Imagine a day in the life of a pinball, rendered into music by the James Bond composers. (Even the opening credits featured a unique take on the iconic Disney fairy-castle, something that primed me for a visual treat.)<br /><br />That brings me to other visual elements, too, and not just the remarkable synthespian built electronically from the younger Bridges's face. Various scenes represent open homage to the hi-tech lairs of Bond bad guys, the enigmatic dinner setting near the end of [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001]], the climactic light-saber fight of [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars]], maybe a whiff of [[ASIN:B000EGDB10 Mission Impossible]], and probably lots more that I missed. If I were so minded, I pick nits in the movie endlessly - but I saw it with the intent of enjoying it, and succeeded in that goal.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B000JMLFLW|5.0|I have always loved reading a good book but I am a romantic at heart and when I started searching for Kindle freebies I came across many different categories of authors. (My mind likes to organise and categorize things). There are the Christian romance authors who explicitly introduce concepts of God and his love for us as they enfold and develop the love story between the main characters. There are the Sex-driven romance authors who give you great details on the physical attraction between the characters and then give you a front row seat (in your imagination of course) to all or some of the sexual experiences in the story. There are the sci-fi based romance authors whose love stories are mystical and many times quite unthinkable. And of course there are the action based romances where the hero is invariably going to end up in some situation (like a fight or car chase) where his machoism will be displayed to the full appreciation of the heroine. And then there are the Historical romance authors who may take any of the aforementioned slants but just given from a historical stand point. Their stories tend to have lot of substance since their work is more often than not well researched and offer detiails and facts of how society and life in general was in the past.<br /><br />Jane Austen's work in Pride and Prejudice falls into none of my categories. You see although she mentions that the characters went to church, she never quite gave us a sermon. Even the value of sex within marriage was the standard of the day and as she dealt with this topic it was in no way an attempt to be \\"preachy\\". It is not sex-driven for there are no sex scenes and quite frankly many physical details on the characters are missing and instead an overview of the person's features are simply stated as \\"Mr. Darcy was tall and handsome\\". There was no mysticism or any element of science fiction and the greatest action any of the characters indulged in was taking a walk. The men did not even work hard but rather spent a lot of time reading in their libraries or playing indoor games (like cards). And while we read of carriages and horses and an England of long ago, the truth of the matter is that this is neither the work of a historical romance author because Ms. Austen wrote about her own time and the dependence of women on marriage for economic security and as a means to escape social ridicule and shame. And yet it is a wonderful and probably the best romance story I have ever read (even though I hace not yet categorized it) and not because of its quite ancient philosophies of women but because it is so frank and honest when told through the eyes of the female protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet.<br /><br />It is a pure work of art and Ms. Austen not only transported me to a different time but to a different place and I was amazed at how enthralled I was at this very \\"wordy\\" books. Yes I love words too but there is a definite art in the way she strung words together with witticism and/or sarcasm for the various dialogue scenes.<br />When held up next to this masterpiece, many modern day romance stories look so immature and hurried. Their creators would do well to read literature such as this! This book has stood the test of time!
B004ASVS0E|3.0|First, this was a great deal at $1.99 compared to $9.99 at Costco, but I'd have felt foolish having spent much more.  The musical arrangements are sometimes interesting and even quasi-symphonic, and she also brings out rarely performed verses of traditional songs, but her voice sounds really strained and inconsistent.  Perhaps it's in the production or just a byproduct of aging, but her voice sounds highly processed and occasionally tired and slightly unsettling.  Obviously, this is not as noticeable as Bob Dylan singing Christmas songs, but it's there nonetheless.  Listen to samples before buying.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Now, I haven't seen the American version but I can imagine that it pales in comparison. The acting, the timing, the well-crafted plot, it's hard to think of ways that this movie could have been better. I didn't laugh 'till I cried, but I don't really mind because that's always a bit uncomfortable when you start to have trouble breathing. However I did laugh (loudly) while watching it alone in my room, much to the disturbance of my roommate who was having a \\"grown up sleepover\\" at the time.  I've gotten side-tracked, but this is an absurdly funny movie and I'm determined to show it to everyone I know. You should too.  P.S. Alan Tudyk stole the show in this movie, and it's an absolute crime that he isn't more well known.

B003YUC2FE|4.0|The movies are great, and reviewed many other places.  My only issue possibly concerns owners of LG BD 370 Blu-Ray players.  The Toy Story 3 Blu-Ray has significant audio problems when played on this player.  There is an easy fix though --> When the main feature starts playing, hit the Audio button, on the LG remote, twice to select ENG2 and the sound works fine.  Hopefully a firmware update will come out to fix this issue.<br /><br />Love the movies - can't wait to watch all the extras.

B000068FWC|4.0|Supertramp...such an enigma who, after more than 30 years after it's release, really holds up as a great group that had their own, distiguishable sound. I don't know much about them other than (I think) that Roger Hodgson was the main, steering force.<br /><br />Before this album came out, this Brittish band was a fringe group in the U.S.A. Their crystaline sound (which the production sounds pretty contemporary today) gave them a sort of edgy, unique, Boston/Tom Schulz-type tone. They mixed genres of prog, art, glam, and pop during a time when that mixture was considered unique. Ironically, this is the cornerstone of so many contemporary jam bands like Phish and Umphreys McGhee.<br /><br />Supertramp was known by music affectionados like me, yet the general public perceived \\"Bloody Well Right\\" as very outside the mainstream, freak music.<br /><br />Then, \\"Breakfast in America\\" came out. This was one of the biggest albums of 1979-1980. \\"Logical Song\\", \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", \\"Breakfast in America\\" and \\"Take the Long Way home\\" dominated the radio, most person's cassette players and turntables and were mainstays of cover bands.<br /><br />These songs sounded fresh, yet familiar, virtuostic yet poppy, melodic yet they also took unexpected turns. This was a welcome change from the slumbering 70's hard rock, limited punk rock and overly pretentious new wave. While this is pure classic rock today, from today's standard, back then it was unclassifiable.<br /><br />This album made Supertramp huge but their follow up yielded a lot less. Then they had a live album and by 1981-1982, Supertramp was done. You really never hear about them today. That's a big mistake.<br /><br />Listening to this today, \\"Breakfast in America\\" sounds better than ever. While this was somewhat trendy/cutting edge in 1979, today, it is very evident that the musicianship, arrangements and songwriting were fantastic. This music does not totally retain it's freshness (like roots or raw music would) but it, nonetheless, holds up pretty well.<br /><br />The singles off this cd are top notch works of art. The other cuts are of quality too.<br /><br />While not offering any criticism of this band, and I recommend this cd, Supertramp lends itself much better to a compilation. Their famous stuff is great but their longer, more adventurous songs are equally as appealing. Their music comes alive better in an extended suite, where the beautiful keyboards, punctuating guitar, emotional falsetto vocals and crashing crescendos are featured... as opposed to in a 3 minute pop song<br /><br />I was not a huge fan of this group in their prime (because I did not want to jump on trendy bandwagon) but I appreciate this group much more today.s off this cd are top notch works of art.

030746363X|2.0|As recommended, I read the \\"diet\\" section related to weight loss and I had to stop there as I have so many issues with it. First, there are countless inconsistencies within the dieting chapters but mostly it leaves you asking, what exactly should I do???:    Tim says to eat a very restricted diet with no carbs, no dairy, and no fruit. Basically his prescribed diet is green vegetables and lean protein. That's about all the guidance you get. But, in the FAQ chapter, he claims you can still drink wine, use soy milk (with caution), and have protein shakes -- plus some more things that are inconsistent like mentioning peanut butter and nuts as okay even though they seem off-limits from the previous chapter. Basically, there's no real definition for what you should or should not eat, what is or is not \\"off-limits,\\" how many times per day you should actually eat (he mentions anywhere from 2-6), or how much protein you should be consuming at each meal (is it 20 grams or 30 grams? I got confused).     In the exercise section, there are photographs of what you should do, but there's no prescription for how many times per day/week/month you should do each of the exercises.     That said, the book was completely amusing. The stories are pretty funny and the stunts are downright ridiculous which almost compensates for the distracted, meandering, non-specific guidance within the pages.     Basically, leave this one for when you need a good laugh and not for actually accomplishing any of the outrageous claims. The old adage holds, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.
0786915749|1.0|Dragons of Autumn Twilight markets itself as fantasy, but if the readers of this boring little novel want to feel any sense of wonder, I am afraid it will only come from wondering why you ever spent your hard-earned dollars on such a plotless, poorly written, miserable and dull old book. Dragons of Autumn Twilight fails at just about every level a book is capable of failing at.     Don't even bother going to the library to read this silly tale - your time is just far too valuable. I will never be reading anything by Weis and Hickman again.
B001A2ADGI|4.0|Although there is nothing much to fault with this stereo pressing, you can't help noticing how poor the stereo imaging is for this record; a victim of the early days of stereo mixing. Although there was a sticker on the cover proclaiming \\"Back to Black\\", I think it would have been much better and faithful reproduction if the mono version was offered.
0446679089|1.0|Most of the other reviewers touched on the same problems I had with the book. It was way too long for what it is. The humor is right out of middle school. Most of the humor is sexist.<br /><br />You should pass one this one.

030746363X|5.0|This review is simple for me. Outstanding book. Easy to read. Easy to follow. If you can find 1 thing in this book that helps you with your body or goals, then it was worth the buy.  Not to mention, it's a very entertaining read.  I haven't even finished the entire book, I've just read the sections that pertained most to me, but I would definitely recommend it.  As a matter of fact, I bought the book again (a 3rd copy) for my brother after reading two chapters. He's reading it now and absolutely loving it.      It is compelling, but I'm sure if you have a negative attitude, it can convince you that inaction is rational. Don't be the fat guy in the red BMW.

0525423273|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss is a book like any other that will melt your heart and demand your constant attention until you are finished. It's a book that latches on to your life, and you carry with you every where to sneak in a few more pages of reading time. I loved every single page of it. It's smart, funny, set IN PARIS, and very down to earth. Every page makes you love the story more and more.<br /><br />I loved the characters. Every single one of them. They were all flawed and made mistakes. Better yet, they even made note of these and learned from them! Now on to the characters themselves... I'll start with Etienne St. Clair. He was just lovely and he stole my heart. He is an American who lives in France AND has an AWESOME English accent. What's not to love? He's also fairly short, which is something brought up many many a' time. Anna Oliphant has one of the best names ever. She was funny and I liked how no matter what was thrown at her, she still kept her self respect.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins has a serious way with words. Not a single word in Anna and the French Kiss is wasted. Anna and the French Kiss is very real. While romance is a big idea, the story is so down to earth and all the characters have many different issues. I hate when characters have perfect lives, and that is not the case in Anna and the French Kiss. With all the characters having trying matters in their lives, it made it really easy to connect with each and every one of them. There was also a lot of variety in emotion in Anna and the French Kiss. Parts of the book had me laughing so hard I was almost crying and others were very touching and emotional and sad.<br /><br />Another awesome thing about Anna and the French Kiss was how the story didn't just talk about the main character's relationship. You had the romance problems of other characters, whether it be relationship issues or something else. I liked that it wasn't just centered around the main characters.<br /><br />Basically to sum this all up, I say: This book is perfect beyond anything you can imagine. Stephanie Perkins is a gold star author, and I am very excited for her next book, Lola and the Boy Next Door, for if Anna and the French Kiss was any indicator, it shall be amazing. Stephanie Perkins is the next big thing.is perfect beyond anything you can imagine. Stephanie Perkins is a gold star author, and I am very excited for her next book, Lola and the Boy Next Door, for if Anna and the French Kiss was any indicator, it shall be amazing.

0307592839|5.0|This trend of threading together stories with a thematic element seems to be all the rage right now and with bug success; 'The Imperfectionists\\", and \\"Let The Great World Spin\\" immediately come to mind. Now Jennifer Egan has written a time shifting narrative about a group of people who seem to spin off the central axis of Bennie Salazar a hot shot music producer in contemporary New York. But soon Egan is shifting time backwards and forwards, where we see the genesis of many of these characters as well as the sometimes tragic demise of others. I was along for the ride on this, and I really didn't want it to end. Technical side note, one chapter is devoted to a character who tells much of her story through a power point presentation which on the kindle is terribly hard to read even with the improved contrast ratio on the new version of the hardware. If you have an iPad or even kindle app on your computer, I'd suggest read this particular chapter on it.
0385737955|5.0|I loved this book. There is no other way to put it. I had been looking forward to it since before its release, but for some reason I never read it. I had heard people preach of its awesomeness, yet I just kept reading other things. What a dumb thing to do, as this book is one of the most amazing things you will ever read. It is by far the best dystopian.<br /><br />I will now put things into even further perspective. I had a blogger friend who hadn't read The Maze Runner yet to rate The Maze Runner on a scale of House of Night to Brightly Woven. If you didn't know, I find Brightly Woven to be about the world's greatest book. The Maze Runner lands a solid 9 on this scale, maybe even higher. It is pure geniusness. In case you haven't realized this, I love this book a lot.<br /><br />The Maze Runner is a book that you will not be able to put down. Right away on page one, you get caught up in the story. Thomas, the main character, lands down in the Glade and has no idea where he is or what is going on. You are kind of in the same boat, and you experience that same sense of discovery that Thomas does. As you discover what is going on and WHAT the Glade is, you just get more involved trying to figure out all the other little details of the plot.<br /><br />I really enjoy a good dystopian. Lately, dystopians haven't been living up to my expectations, but I found The Maze Runner to go beyond every expectation I have for it. I can't really put my finger on it, but lately every dystopian I read, there's something just a bit off about it, or some aspect that just lets me down. The Maze Runner did this is no way, shape, or form.<br /><br />Something I really liked about The Maze Runner was the lack of romance. Lately, it seems every book pushes romance, and particularly in dystopians, I find these to fall flat and usually end up with me not liking the book. The Maze Runner instead has a very strong essence of friendship, which felt so real, and I was really happy the Dashner did not try to go the other way and try to push a love story.<br /><br />The Maze Runner is definitely a thrilling read, to keep you on the edge of your seat. There are several scenes where the tension and suspense are so intense, and you were basically falling out of your chair to find out what happened next. The evil beings in The Maze Runner are these half machine and half creepy creature called Grievers. They are so creepy and the name makes them even scarier.<br /><br />The characters were a lot of fun. All the characters were so vastly different. The qualities in each weren't really repeated, and it was really unique. These characters are in this world where they have to live their own lives, and their strongest qualities seem to be brought out most. In some, their strongest quality is evidently what leads to their downfall. Teresa was my favorite character of the book, hands down. I liked the strength she brought with her.<br /><br />The plot will keep you guessing until the very last page. James Dashner doesn't let you figure out everything, and as soon as you figure out one small detail, you're left with about 5 more to figure out. I also feel the urge to mention my love for the cover and how I think it captures the essence of the Glade perfectly.<br /><br />I have found a new favorite author. Please now excuse me, as I am leaving and going to reading more of The Scorch Trials, which is just as good as The Maze Runner so far, and I may be slightly addicted. And by slightly, you should realize I mean extremely addicted ;)d try to push a love story.    The Maze Runner is definitely a thrilling read, to keep you on the edge of your seat.

B0047SF41G|1.0|I loved both Predator and Predator 2, but Predators was a simply awful attempt at rebooting the franchise. Robert Rodriguez is one of those directors whose movies tend to draw extreme reactions, one way or the other, from audiences, and mine was extremely negative. Reading all the four star and five star reviews here makes me think I saw another movie because it simply can't be possible that we watched the same tripe, predictable farce of a movie. I thought this was the worst movie I saw in 2010. The acting was uninspired. Adrien Brody may have put on pounds of muscles for the movie, but he could not convey the tough guy machismo and credibility that his role required.  Laurence Fishburne's cameo was ho hum and an utter waste of time. For an action movie, the action was surprisingly lukewarm.     Save yourself time and money, and stay away far, far away from this movie.
B003UESJH4|5.0|As my prof. always asked of us: use \\"Pithy and pungent prose.:\\"  The audience applauded at the conclusion.  When was the last time any of us experienced that reaction.  Mr. Firth (!) in on camera almost the entire time.
0307595579|5.0|Loved the books, super impressed with Amazon's shipping time - two weeks earlier than expected, and arrived before Christmas - couldn't be happier.
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|I was surprised to hear good Christmas music in this movie that lifted my spirits and put me in the Christmas mood. I also liked them not deleting the Lord out of the Movie. It's nice to see that in a Disney movie. Most of your Disney Christmas movies never mention God. I'll give them credit for this one and also the Muppet Christmas movie a few years ago. By the way; ever go to a Disney park during Christmas time? No mention of the Lord Jesus or even a manger. Back then there was no room at the inn for Jesus. Nothings changed these days; no room at Disneyland for Jesus either. At least, I never saw anything related to Jesus, while I was there Christmas. The computer animation and camera movements, in the movie, were superb. The Christmas Carol was worth this blue ray combo price. Wall-mart wasn't that much cheaper on this one.
1558908358|5.0|Amazon needs to reduce the price of this movie its ludicrous that this movie is nearly 200.00 just to own. Come on!
0553381687|5.0|George Martin is a talented writer.  The story is great, complex, something one can sink his teeth into, something that alters one's reality for a little while. But, the author has been taking too long to finish the series.  I'm the type of reader that doesn't mind waiting a year or so for the next book, if it's good.  This series is that good and more.  However, GRRM published the 4th book in 2005, promised the 5th in 2006, while Amazon is estimating that next book will come out in 2012.<br /><br />I'll have moved on, annoyed with myself for getting sucked in to an unfinished series.  This story is better than Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, but I worry that the author will die before finishing, just like Jordan did.

B0033AX1YG|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have absolutely NO idea why Gary Moore has not \\"caught on\\" in the US as he is a True (& One Of The Few) Blues Guitar Masters. He is immensely popular in Europe & SHOULD be here as well (for those of you that don't know, he used to be in Thin Lizzy). I can't believe this collection hasn't been reviewed by now either. At any rate, the performances, editing & sound (both DTS & Dolby Digital) are all top notch (considering the 1st show is now 20 years old). I had very high expectations for this set & they were way, way surpassed! You get the 2 DVD's with parts of all Gary's MJF shows from 1990-2001. Plus you get a \\"bonus\\" CD as well (which is over an hour long). I'm not even gonna go into individual song reviews, they all are great! Don't think about it or procrastinate, just get it - you'll be Very Happy that you did! It's Pure Unabridged Fender / Gibson Heaven!!! Wake Up North America!!!
144471032X|1.0|We received two books in the mail yesterday: an advance review copy of Gary Taubes' [[ASIN:0307272702 Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It]] and The Dukan Diet. The significance of The Dukan Diet is that it's the plan Prince William's future mother-in-law, Carole Middleton, is using to slim down for the Royal wedding of William and Kate. It's also been reported that Dukan's diet was the \\"magic\\" behind the post-pregnancy slim-downs of both Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen and American singer/actress Jennifer Lopez. The Dukan diet has been written about in People Magazine and talked about on E!    There is a very superficial similarity between these books: both advocate low carbohydrate diets as the best way to lose weight and permanently maintain the loss. But there the similarity ends and these books couldn't be more different in background, style and substance. Taubes' work is based upon years of meticulous research and represents a synthesis of evidence drawn from the fields of biochemistry, metabolism, physiology, endocrinology, epidemiology, and clinical research. Taubes makes a compelling case against the \\"energy balance\\" paradigm, which may have inadvertently contributed to the epidemics of obesity and diabetes in the U.S. and elsewhere. You can read more about Taubes' work on MedPageToday (Food Fight over whether Hitler made us Fat).    In contrast, Dukan's dietary beliefs and recommendations are based on i) anecdotal evidence and trial-and-error observations in his clinical practice and ii) \\"market validation\\" from sales figures of his book. In 2007 The Dukan Diet was second only to Harry Potter on Amazon France and also sold well in Bulgaria and Poland. (The book is currently only available for pre-order in the U.S. and isn't due out until May 2011. Our copy came from Amazon UK). We could not find any publications by Dukan or about his diet among the ~20 million biomedical research articles indexed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. The only research studies referred to in the book are \\"coprological studies\\" comparing the calorie contents of feces from individuals who have or have not eaten oat bran.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Beg to differ with all the negatives. If you hate Christmas music, maybe you shouldn't review this in the first place. If you don't like Dylan's late-period sound, well, maybe you shouldn't review this either. It's late Dylan, craggy-voiced but on key!. Review the disc for what it is, not for what you think it should have been. It isn't a joke -- it's Dylan enjoying himself singing some songs he digs, and donating the proceeds to charity. Pretty simple. If you don't like his late sound, fine, but it is what he has to work with right now.     Anybody who listened to his radio show \\"Theme Time Radio Hour\\" knows that Dylan digs Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, and a lot of the old-school popular singers in addition to Charley Patton and Hank Williams. This is Bob Dylan, being himself, and having fun. If you feel like having some Christmas music going but aren't crazy about smooth singers, and if you have a sense of fun and humor, enjoy this album in the spirit it was offered. Don't try to force Dylan into the box of what you think he should be. I know others feel differently, but for me, this is the best Christmas album ever.    And whether you agree or disagree.... Happy holidays to ya!
0316098337|5.0|There seem to be lots of very large and detailed reviews here, so if I tried to go into detail, it would just be repetitive.  I'll just say that I am absolutely exhausted as I'm typing this, because (as many others have said) I literally could not put this book down longer than the time it took to go to the bathroom.  That was a bit unfortunate, because I didn't start the book until 11:30 p.m.  Normally, when I start a book as bedtime reading, I will read until I get sleepy and then put it aside until the next night.  Last night, I saw 4 a.m. for the first time in a long time.  That's what time it was when I finished the last page and shut the book.  But I HAD TO KNOW what was going to happen.  Thank goodness I didn't have to get up and go in to work today.
0553374842|5.0|a beautiful book with lavish drawings, nice bio on the worlds coverd in the book, deffinately one to have if your a STAR WARS fan. highly recommended.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|I normally do not take the time to post reviews, but I am here buying this BluRay Disk after watching my Blockbuster rental last night.  All I can tell you is that this is perhaps one of the best action flicks you will ever see. Real and believable and AJ is amazing...doing most of her own stunts.  I will say that the theatrical ending leaves the door wide open for a sequel. Can't wait.
0385340540|5.0|The way he describes Italy is right on point.  He is rumored to have gained 30 lbs living in Bologna, Italy, while writing this book.
B003ES61EE|5.0|There really is nothing negative to say about this product. I was perplexed to get my hands on this item as I noticed it was 'Amazon Branded' and thus it could've been anyone's guess regarding quality.<br /><br />The size is compact enough for it to stow away nicely and it has a shirt pocket clip if you need to add it to your plastic pocket protector, ahem.<br /><br />While I usually use the chamois that comes with my lenses to clean them, this is useful for other surfaces that collect specks, junk or debris of any kind. The rubber tip for smudges is not something I'd consider a 'go to' or even a 'must' so to speak, but it's good to have. The bristles on this are very soft and aren't abrasive at all. I don't think it would dislodge something stuck on a surface, but it definitely won't scratch anything either.<br /><br />Frustration free packaging though? Really? Would this frustrate an environmentalist? More than likely. Check the pics I posted for this. I'm not removing any stars because of the packaging, but I did find the current packaging configuration a bit wasteful. I never remark on this in reviews, but just take a peek at the photos.
B004259BMM|5.0|Keith has done it again!  \\"Put You in a Song\\" is very catchy.  Like the rest of the songs, too.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|David Fincher is one of the most prolific directors today and he's tackled some of the most intriguing stories to capture on film. From the gritty underworld of [[ASIN:B001BPQT8A Seven [Blu-ray Book]]] and [[ASIN:B001992NUQ Fight Club (10th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]]] to the gleaming world of [[ASIN:B001U0HBQ0 The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]]] and the very real [[ASIN:B001HUHBAE Zodiac [Blu-ray]]], Fincher has not only taken audiences into these worlds with lush visuals, but he's also delved headlong into each subject with such vivacity that it's shone through with each release. Even though I thought \\"Benjamin Button\\" was basically a slight rehash of [[ASIN:B002L9N4DS Forrest Gump (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray]]] (and that was thanks to screenwriter Eric Roth, who also wrote \\"Gump\\"), I still liked the way it was shot and the acting. I've enjoyed every movie Fincher has done. So when I heard there was a movie being made about Facebook, the newest socializing network, I rolled my eyes, let out a heavy, moaning sigh and instantly imagined some MTV-style production with teenaged nitwits (Hollywood's newest unknown actors) running around and using slang that seems to be among the in-crowd in high schools today, set to the newest music that is more noticed for its style rather than its actual meaning and quality. But, when I heard Fincher was taking the helm and it was based on a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (the man behind [[ASIN:B000HC2LI0 The West Wing: The Complete Series Collection]]; have you seen him in \\"Entourage?\\" GREAT!), based on the non-fiction book [[ASIN:0307740986 The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook: A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal]] by Ben Mezrich (\\"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas\\"), I was - to say the least - much more intrigued. And once that brilliant movie trailer - the one featuring the Scala & Kolacny Brothers' cover of Radiohead's \\"Creep\\" - premiered, I was on board!<br /><br />I have to say that \\"The Social Network\\" is one of the best fictional non-fiction films I've seen recently. Whether it's Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's public relations working overtime or not, reports have been rapidly surfacing at how unlike the actual Zuckerberg is compared to the film's representation of Zuckerberg, played magnificently by Jesse Eisenberg, one of this generation's most underrated actors (a thinking man's Michael Cera, if you will). Another real-life person whose camp is announcing that he is different from his onscreen portrayal is Justin Timberlake's Sean Parker, the co-creator of Napster. Timberlake's performance is already creating Oscar buzz and while he does a great job, I think that both Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield (who portrays Facebook co-creator Eduardo Saverin, and was just cast as Peter Parker in the new film reboot of \\"Spider-Man\\") should be nominated. Don't get me wrong, Timberlake lovers. The former N*Sync singer does a great job and proves that he's a force to be reckoned with in drama as well as comedy. But it's Eisenberg and Garfield who showcased a keen relationship that could've been a disaster for any other actors who don't have such a rapport with each other; a good example of this rapport is the relationship between Dr. House (Hugh Laurie) and Dr. Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) in FOX's \\"House.\\" Even in the film during the legal proceedings, where Zuckerberg and Saverin's friendship is disintegrating, they still exude a caring playfulness that makes the audience feel bad about the anger and tragedy of their situation. As for who to believe is the real Zuckerberg and Parker - the film's or the person's - both seem to have a lot to gain for audiences believing them. The film makes more money on box office sales, whereas the actual Zuckerberg and Parker don't face public humiliation and possible loss of business products, which directly affects their wallets. I believe that whilethe events in the film did happen (except for Zuckerberg's girlfriend dumping him), the film did take creative license in how the characters came off. Nevertheless, the caricatures of Zuckerberg, Saverin, Parker, Divya Narendra, and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are all great characters. And they're played pitch perfect by the actors.<br /><br />I said in my review for Inception that it was the best film of the year and that the only prospects of taking that mantle from it were Ben Affleck's [[ASIN:B002ZG99NG The Town (Extended Cut Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]] and this film. And while I was impressed with \\"The Town,\\" it was not worthy of best film. On the other hand, Fincher's Facebook film comes closer to winning that title (but still doesn't beat out [[ASIN:B002ZG981E Inception (Two-Disc) [Blu-ray]]]). I have yet to see Clint Eastwood's \\"Hereafter\\" (another runner-up for the title of Best Film), but, so far, \\"Inception\\" leads the way and \\"The Social Network\\" comes in at a close second. While \\"Network\\" is loosely based on the true story of the creation of Facebook, as I said before, it is not a concise history of the creation or of its inventors. Still, I loved Eigenberg's portrayal of Zuckerberg! He's written and acted out as this social outcast - almost as if he has Asperger's syndrome - who is ambitious and equally ruthless when it comes to business; yet, he's also a sad, lonely young man who secretly just wants to be accepted in society and by the woman he loves, and his entire motivation to create Facebook and become successful is to ultimately be accepted and loved by the one that got away. It makes for a great story and that's just what \\"The Social Network\\" accomplishes.<br /><br />Here is a film that may appeal more to younger generations (those of the computer age), but is good enough for older generations as well. It's reminiscent of what Orson Welles did with William Randolph Hearst in [[ASIN:B00003CX9E Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] back in 1941. Although the names were changed in that film, Welles wrote the character of Charles Foster Kane to be based on newspaper magnate Hearst. Welles wrote and portrayed Kane as a war-mongering, Ebenezer Scrooge-like character who pushed away everyone who truly cared for him. The story closely resembles the image that Sorkin paints of Zuckerberg; it's a cautionary tale of having everything in the world but not being happy. And it's that theme that resonates with most people. Everyone is afraid of high living at a high cost; and I'm not talking about money being the cost.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Zuckerberg could be viewed as a modern-day Hearst. He's a genius who took a technology one step forward to change the world. What I liked best about this version was that glorious ending which gives a true peek into the film Zuckerberg's obsession. Love it or hate it, The Social Network is brilliantly written, acted and directed. There are a few misses in the overall pacing of the story (I wish Sorkin could've put more history into the story about what happened after Sean Parker was arrested), but it's still entertaining and one of the best of the year.ts in the film did happen (except for Zuckerberg's girlfriend dumping him), the film did take creative license in how the characters came off.

B002H3F7F6|1.0|This CD will make you want to kill yourself.  It's all down-tempo without a single joyful song.  I assume Sting was trying to be \\"serious.\\"  The problem is clear on the very first song, \\"Gabriel's Message\\" -- which was so mesmerizing when he sang it on \\"A Very Special Christmas.\\" Here he doesn't even follow the correct melody.  Rather than resolve the tune as traditionally sung, \\"Most highly favoured lady. Glo-ri-a.\\" -- Sting stays on the same note for the last two syllables of \\"Gloria.\\" (Downbeat.)  And at the end of the song, he even refuses to sing the last syllable.  So the song stays mournful, flat, and incomplete.  Avoid this CD at all costs.
B0019OP0GU|5.0|Based on Noel Streatfeild's novel of the same name, Ballet Shoes is the story of three orphaned girls adopted by a world traveler and raised by his niece in London in the 1930s. Pauline (Harry Potter's Emma Watson) wants to be an actress, Petrova, an aviator and Posy, a ballerina. When the benefactor disappears, their money runs out. All have to struggle to meet their goals but survive emotionally and financially and support one another as a family unit. This is an enjoyable light tale of determination with a cast of odd lovable characters.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|I dont like giving bad reviews. Its just this book was not what I was expecting. Its just that everyone got what they wanted and I was expecting a loss or a fight to the finish. It just seems a ton of pages rushed through. It has a good concept. I was just expecting Bella to grow as a person not be a whiny brat. Jacob to find his place. I would like the story to revolve around Edward. For some reason I feel Edward was left out. I just wanted more Edward.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This moving film tells the story of the fight to outlaw slavery throughout the British Empire during the late 18th century. Based upon true events, we learn of idealist William Wilberforce, who fights in Parliament for the abolition of the trade and is pushed along by many including his pastor, John Newton.<br /><br />Newton was a slave trader who experienced a \\"great deliverance\\" during a storm at sea. He came to recognize the inherent evil of the slave trade and for the rest of his life tried to make amends to his savior for the wrong he committed against his fellow man. Newton is the author of the timeless hymn \\"Amazing Grace.\\"<br /><br />The film is moving and inspirational with wonderful acting by Albert Finney and Michael Gambon.

After their ship wrecks, the animals find themselves on Madagascar and are befriended by a fun-filled group of lemurs. The movie has laughs, incredible animation, and is a nice story of friendship.

B000ZELISO|1.0|This is a negative review of Warner Brothers - and the digital product that I purchased.  This is not a review of the movie.<br /><br />I purchased the Blu-Ray, DVD + Digital copy version.  Somewhere on the back of the cardboard sleve that came with the case, are some tiny words that tell you the Digital Copy expires on May 7, 2010.  On the front of the package are giant words:  \\"Combo Pack includes Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy\\".  Who reads all the fine print on the back prior to purchase?<br /><br />Expiration date?  Fine print?  I had intended to wait until I purchased a new computer with a larger hard drive to download the movie (my iTunes folder is getting really big).  Why would Warner Brothers behave so poorly?  I had no reason to dislike WB until now.  I feel cheated and ripped off.  I will forever feel hestitant to purchase anything from WB ever again.  Buyer beware!

1400079144|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book quite a bit. I saw most of the plot twists coming before they happened, but i normally do in books and movies so that may not be a good judgment on the book itself. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book, and finished it in 4 days. for me that is a very interesting read. The book has some darker tones to it that might not be suitable for everyone, such as torture, murder, and dismemberment.    I really enjoyed the reference to factual things and places. The moral to the story at the end is also very potent and something that should be taken to heart.     Highly recommended read :)

B0041KOVNM|5.0|With the year closing and my need for fresh metal sounds growing, I decided to start perusing some best of 2010 lists.  One such list thankfully led me to the mighty Ghost, a Swedish metal band whose songs instantly had me fervently nodding my head and smiling in knowing appreciation.  My first thought?  Why the heck haven't I heard more bands truly trying to capture the (black) magic of Mercyful Fate!      I think the answer probably lies in Mercyful Fate's uniqueness from an overall sound perspective, but more importantly their utter genius in songwriting.  It's a very tough act to follow, and yet Ghost have managed to tap into that sound brilliantly with catchy tunes, excellent vocals that--as another reviewer mentioned--will really remind a hardcore Voivod fan of Snake at his best, deeply twisted horror lyrics, and production that's just glossy enough without being too over the top.  Add a touch of early '80s Blue Öyster Cult and you have a group that truly stands out as being an homage to some of the best bands ever, yet utterly different amongst the greater crop of 21st Century metal.  \m/    EDIT: I've gotten a lot of comments on this review, plus and minus, many ultimately deleted.  I think it's interesting to see just how polarizing this record is on all fronts, and I've enjoyed reading the spectrum of opinions.  After a ton of listens though I continue to stand by both the review and the comparisons to the bands mentioned for the various reasons I mentioned them.  If you don't get it or it ain't your bag, especially on the vocal front, I understand.  I know a lot of metal fans that miss out on King Diamond because they can't get behind his voice.  I can't begin to count the number of people I know that miss out on amazing music because they can't handle screams or growls.    I happen to love this record; the other guitarist in my band happens to hate it.  Thankfully there are many tastes for many tongues in this world.

B002ZG99NG|4.0|A strong, fun and very well detailed crime thriller, but not nearly as subtle or emotionally and morally complex as Affleck's earlier 'Gone Baby Gone'.<br /><br />There's a lot of clich&eacute;s here, especially in the third act; car chases and huge over-the-top shootouts which, while well handled, make this feel much more like a familiar Hollywood movie.  Also, some of the supporting characters fall into 'types' we've seen many times before.  That was  something Affleck avoided in  'Gone Baby Gone' -- despite that film being a hard boiled detective thriller, hardly an under-done genre.<br /><br />Indeed, a lot of this film, including the central plot itself treads familiar water, but it does it with enough grown up intelligence, good acting, and specificity to let us get caught up anyway. And at least, by the end, a few of the 'obvious' set ups, have actually led us somewhere quite different than the standard Hollywood treatments we've seen before would lead us to expect.<br /><br />I just hope Affleck, an obviously extremely talented film-maker, returns to the kind of thematically richer and more original material he mined in his first film.  This shows talent and flair, but I longed for those deeper layers.

The characters are smart, the story is engaging, and I usually find that I have to read it all in one sitting because it's just that good. I just read Speaker for the Dead, and can't believe it's taken me this long to read the rest of the Ender Saga. I will be reading more of Card's work in the near future.

B001FB4VXU|5.0|THE BIG BANG THEORY is a sitcom about four nerdy colleagues and Penny, the girl-across-the-hall as their lives intersect.<br /><br />Wonderfully funny, the show is very cleverly written. With dry humor and intelligent (super-intelligent) dialog the brainy boys try to cope with the world and mere common folks. They approach the issues of life (love, sex, friendships, culture) from a zany perspective which keeps the laughs rolling. Sheldon, the smartest of the bunch, is a theoretical physicist with an ironic, dry wit and sweet vulnerability. He is the star of the show and, if he were writing this review, he would agree.<br /><br />The show is quick-witted and smart, poking fun at everyone, not the least of whom are our four heroes and the adorable Penny. Be careful, it is addictive.

B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller works very well and has a long battery life. I've always liked the placement of the buttons on the PS2/PS3 controllers as it feels more natural to me than the XBOX controller. I love that you can charge the controllers through the USB port in the PS3 and seems to be a better value and less confusing than the XBOX controllers (wired, battery powered wireless, chargeable battery pack wireless). However, I think the XBOX controller's trigger is better because the trigger is curved like a trigger. I bought these triggers ([[ASIN:B001IAOEXU PS3 Dual Triggers]]) and they make these ps3 controllers perfect. I've never tried 3rd party controllers with the PS3 (I have never bought any 3rd party controllers since having bad experiences with the SNES and Sega Genesis).

0451457994|4.0|It is possible to read 2001: A Space Odyssey in isolation, without consideration of any of Clarke's other work. This is a perfectly legitimate way to read the book. But its similarities in theme and content to his much earlier Childhood's End (a novel I hated) are so striking that I find that in contrasting them I am able to articulate in a much more coherent manner what I enjoyed about this novel and what I hated about that one, and why.    Both novels are almost identical in theme: aliens are cunningly and secretly leading humans into the next stage of cosmic evolution. This idea of cosmic evolution, or ascending a great chain of being, is something I blasted Clarke for in my review of Childhood's End, and I still find it a remarkably naive and even deplorable idea. However, he has presented his theme here in a much cleverer manner by, first, connecting one man's apotheosis into a God-like state with a brief history of human evolution, and, second, providing a superior explanation of what this kind of ascendancy would entail. In Childhood's End, humanity's evolution basically involves the mutated alien children of the last generation of humans destroying the world and being absorbed into a wandering galactic hive-mind. It isn't clear, however, that this is any kind of step up at all. The alternative provided by this novel is that a single man is transformed into a \\"star-child,\\" which seems to be some kind of higher life form. This clearly provided a better example of transcendence, and so makes for more engaging speculative fiction. Both novels are also very weak character-wise and plot-wise.    The important thing is the ways in which the two novels can be contrasted, however. Almost everything else is improved. If 2001 has a weak plot, it can at least be conceded that it contains decent storytelling. A large portion of the novel takes place on a spaceship that is en route to Saturn. Clarke manages to inject much legitimate tension into the plot by building up tothe murderous breakdown of the ship's sentient computer, HAL-9000. It also has to be conceded, however, that the novel is often extremely slow. Plot is not the primary concern of this novel. The novel is primarily about the rapturous wonder that is felt by Clarke about the amazing material universe we find ourselves inhabiting. He expertly conveys this sense of wonder so well that I actually looked forward to the numerous slow-moving chapters. This is in contrast to Childhood's End where the slow chapters were just... slow. It is also worth mentioning that 2001 does not share that novel's infatuation with the paranormal. No spooky witch-doctor stuff here. The final important contrast that can be made with Childhood's End is that this novel portrays aliens in a much more alien manner. We never directly 'see' the actual aliens, and their indirect behavior, as little as we see of it, is often baffling and disturbing. This, as opposed to the aliens of Childhood's End, which mingled with humans as if they were homo sapiens themselves, sitting around sipping wines, reading books in peoples' private libraries, and engaging in discussion which agree completely with Clarke's white, 20th century American viewpoint.    2001 isn't perfect. Often the pace is so slow that you want to scream at it to get moving. The characters are weak and the plot is bare-bones and uninspiring. But it does do a lot of things right, and it is short enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome. I would give this book 3.5 stars, but I'll round it up to 4 stars because of the sense of wonder Clarke's descriptions of the physical universe can elicit in the reader.
B000V67588|5.0|This is the greatest album that I've ever heard!  Start with \\"Crime of the Century\\", then get \\"Crises? What Crises\\", then \\"Even in the Quietest Moments\\", then \\"Breakfast in America\\".  Sprinkle a healthy dose of Roger Hodgson's solo albums in there (Roger Hodgson is 1/2 of the original Supertramp.  He's the guy who wrote and sings the large majority of Supertramp's hit songs.)    You won't be disappointed!  Be prepared for a whole new awakening.  Listen at least twice, at a fairly high volume with NO distractions.  You'll be surprised!

B003EYVXSW|1.0|I HATE this movie.<br /><br />Literally. Figuratively. Storyline, photography, dialogue. The female lead actor is horrible. Adrian Brody is quite good, however.<br /><br />IF I SEE ONE MORE ANIMAL \\"die\\" on film, whether staged or not, I will join PETA, hunt down the director(s) responsible, and never ever ever see any of their films again. I've seen enough animal death in my life to know it shouldn't be taken as lightly as it is, whether on film or not. The consciousness and intelligence of the helpless children and animals that suffer every day deserve more than that.<br /><br />Its one redeeming quality is that, for the non-brain-dead who may watch it, it alerts us to the horrors of gene manipulation. This is playing God, playing with fire and gasoline, pure and simple. We need to be putting money into PREVENTING cancer and disease, via lowering pollution and living healthy, instead of funding corporation's profit-making and falling for the lies of \\"we need this science to save people\\"---DON'T DO IT! DO NOT LET THESE PEOPLE WIN, and DO NOT FALL FOR A LIE.<br /><br />So, if you can get past the movie itself, and into the message, and project what the film is trying to convey---although in the Hollywood ridiculousness of a pretend \\"Horror\\" flick---then you may get something out of this. On the other hand, if you're the type that would understand this, then you probably already know all that already, and, thus, the film and story serve virtually no purpose, and it isn't entertaining on any level enough to stand as simple mindnumbing fodder...
B003ES61EE|5.0|This is one of the neatest little items I have ever seen.  I have used SLR cameras since the 70's and I have always needed brushes and cleaning cloths.  Nothing has ever been this well organized and compact.  And it even has a clip on the outside so it can be clipped to your strap, shirt pocket, whatever.  In addition to assists with my camera lens, it is very useful with my slide and negative conversions.  My HP scanner gets a good workout converting slides / negatives to digital form.  The brush is very fine, and an excellent piece of equipment in removing lint or debris from my slides / negatives.  I very highly recommend this Cleaning Pen.
B0042U2HN2|5.0|In his first volume of memoirs, \\"My Young Years,\\" Artur Rubinstein recounts that shortly after Brahms died he heard a performance of the C Minor Piano quartet that made an indelible impression on him: \\"It is impossible to describe my enthusiasm after hearing this music.... From that day on Brahms became my obsession. I had to know everything he had written; instead of working on the pieces for my piano lessons, I would read with ecstasy anything of Brahms which fell into my hands. I would buy his music on credit; I would have stolen money to get it.\\" The evidence of this passion, and the wisdom accumulated over many decades of playing Brahms, is reflected throughout this rewarding box set.<br /><br />Rubinstein was a master of the many moods that are found in Brahms, from the heroic gestures of the trios and violin sonatas to the intimate quietude of the intermezzi, and while his concerto recordings are not by any means unsuccessful, it is in the chamber and solo works that his preeminence as a Brahmsian is most keenly felt. The cello sonatas made with Piatigorsky, the trios with Szeryng and Fournier, and the piano quartets and quintet with the young Guarneri Quartet are, for the most part, first rate efforts.  This should be no surprise - Rubinstein's great skill as a chamber musician can be traced to his relationship with Joachim, one of the great chamber musicians of his (or any) day. And, as it turns out, Rubinstein was one of the relatively few great pianists who, after achieving international fame, didn't feel that his career as a soloist was compromised by sharing the stage with other musicians to make music together.<br /><br />Rubinstein brought special insight and a gorgeous tone to his solo recordings, the highlight of which was a beautiful album including the op. 10 ballades, rhapsodies and several other pieces recorded in 1970 and originally released under the title, \\"The Brahms I Love.\\" These sessions, which had been scattered across several volumes ofthe \\"Rubinstein Edition,\\" are finally available in this set; however, it's a shame that the producers didn't restore the recordings as they were originally programmed instead of using them as fillers on various discs. This doesn't respect the thematic flow of the music as planned by Rubinstein, a real pity as I always cherished this as one of his finest albums.<br /><br />The concertos are interesting on a different level: I remember when RCA issued the stereo 1954 Rubinstein/Reiner recording of the D Minor concerto in the 1970's, which I believe was the first stereo recording ever made of this work, and the critical acclaim it received. But even after more than thirty years of familiarity, I still don't hear the revelations that others do in this reading. Rubinstein's Brahm's First to some degree shares Claudio Arrau's ultra-expansive approach, although he doesn't take things to Arrau's extremes. While it has a certain nobility to it, it lacks the tension and drama that Serkin and Fleisher deliver in their classic recordings with Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra which remain unsurpassed for me.<br /><br />Rubinstein was to have recorded the B Flat concerto, along with a number of other works, with Fritz Reiner, however, the troubled relationship between pianist and conductor came to an abrupt end when the two were recording the Tchaikovsky concerto. Rubinstein biographer Harvey Sachs writes that \\"At the end of the first movement, one of the orchestra's solo wind players had asked Reiner if a certain passage could be rerecorded, because he felt he hadn't played it as well as he could. Reiner grumbled but acceded to the request. When another player asked to record the previous passage as well, for a similar reason, Rubinstein spoke up: 'If we are going back that far, let's go back a bit further still, because I played a few wrong notes just before that.' 'Well, said the notoriously sarcastic Reiner, 'If we're going to correct all of YOUR wrong notes, we'll be hereall day!' Rubinstein stood up and walked off the stage, without saying a word. The recording session ended abruptly, and so did Rubinstein's relationship with Reiner.\\"<br /><br />Rubinstein recorded the Brahms B Flat concerto six times of which the 1958 run-through in this set with Josef Krips, in lieu of Reiner, was the third. Although this recording was probably a big seller in its time given that it was an early stereo release and bore Rubinstein's name, an inconsistent first movement overshadows what is an otherwise fine performance. Rubinstein speeds up here and there, and there are a number of places where details are blurred, not by sloppy fingers but by the pace that he sets. This is a shame because the other three movements are prime Rubinstein: the second movement has an epic sweep with an especially effective finale, and the gorgeous third movement is Rubinstein at his best. The fourth movement proves to be a rousing conclusion to a gargantuan work.<br /><br />All told, this is an outstanding collection, really a \\"must have\\" not just for Rubinstein fans, but for those who love Brahms, chamber music, and great piano playing. Five stars.
B003UYUR10|3.0|Hi: Everyone  This movie is a reminder of Disney films of the past. This movie has a quality story with quality production. It is a fun and adventurous film with non stop action! This great for Children and Adults a like. This film's only fault is being a little too short. I like the film to take me threw the whole story and finish it. It seems now a days with the continuations that writers are finding themselves be demanded to write a possible opening for sequel at the end of every film. This is nice but make sure the original film is long enough!  Anyway this is a good film and as always with Disney very child proof. But parents you should always look in just to make sure.

B002ZG99N6|4.0|I always like to give credit where credit is due. And while Ben Affleck has been in a string of box office dissapointments after winning an Oscar for Good Will Hunting, he certainly hit his mark with \\"The Town\\". For being a first time director, screen writer as well as acting in this film, I think Affleck has hit his mark again in film and I only hope that he continues on his winning streak.     The Town opens with a quote.I'm summarizing of course, but as quoted, \\"No town has produced as many bank robbers as Charlestown. Robbing banks and armoured trucks became a trade passed down from father to son, from one generation to the next.\\"If that didn't grab your interest, the film opens up with a bank robbery. A quick hit (in&out)a Townie crew leaves with the money and this time a hostage.    Doug McCray is the head of this crew,followed by his life long friend Jem who is a little more itchy on the trigger. Jem is paranoid that the the bank manager they took along for \\"a ride\\" saw more than she thinks\\" and he \\"wants to take care of business\\".Doug steps in to look into it instead to cool Jem's heals and put his crew at rest.    The flip side of this is the crew paying its dues to Fergi, or \\"The Flourist\\" who has a tight grip on this Charelstown crew.Well aware that the FBI is on them, in time Doug grows weary of doing any more jobs,and at the same time developes a relationship with the bank manager Clair. Possibly against his better judgent, but  I think he sees her as a means to change, and  to put knocking over banks and armoured cars behind him. Clair, as he sees it, is \\"his Eskimo.\\"    Quiting is not as easy as it seems. Not only will Jem let him leave without doing a few more jobs, but The Flourist won't either.Not without Doug paying dearly for it in the end be it his own life, or someone very close to him.Two more jobs down the line, one nearly getting them pinched and the last...robbing Fenway Park, the biggest heist of all.     The Town is a well rounded film.Itis a \\"heist\\" film on one side, but on the flip side of the coin you have layers of character and conflict.It has some great action with adrenaline pumping car chases and shoot outs. It also has a good dramma side to it.The on screen chemistry between Doug and Clair is realistic and heart felt.You realy want him to \\"make right\\" as well as the others to pull through at the end.Well acted by a great cast and well directed and adapted to the screen by Affleck, it leaves only one to pause, \\"I just wanted you to remember who clipped your nuts first.\\"
B003A4IFDW|5.0|I am from the generation where one bought LP's or CD's. I have never bought any music online. However, that all changed once I heard Bettye LaVette and this album on NPR. It was so incredible that I immediately went to buy it from a brick and mortars store. However to my dismay I could not find it. I finally encountered an album that I enjoyed so much that I relented and bought it via mp3 downloads from Amazon. Mind you, I am not averse to buying music via digital downloads. I have just not been moved enough by recent artists to buy anything online till I heard this album.      In a long-winded way I am saying this is a great album. For me Bettye is not just singing, it's more like listening to a soulful eulogy of my relationships and life experiences. My particular favorite is \\"No Time To Live\\" because I look at my life and I see myself. This is must buy album.
B002ZG9846|4.0|Matthew Vaughn instantly made my top five directors after viewing this film.  His stylization, instinct, and control over musical score is what contributed to a great film.  He will go on to make many more awesome movies, and I intend to view his earlier work.<br /><br />With that being said, Kick-Ass is near-perfect.  Everything about the film is great, but I have one bone to pick with the casting.  I really wanted Chris Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist to work.  Sadly if failed in nearly every one of his scenes for me.  I read the comic, and maybe I expected too much.  But after thinking about it, I realized that Chris doesn't do justice to the comic or the film.  Red Mist needed to be more sleazy and bratty, instead of goofy and sympathetic.  Kick-Ass could have been so much more if the Red Mist role wasn't so satirical.  I've seen Chris's work in Role Models as well as Superbad and I am aware of his expanding potential.  It's just too bad he didn't differentiate enough here.<br /><br />Besides that little bugger, I enjoyed Kick-Ass thouroughly.  I put it about even in enjoyment with the comic, and both versions have their pros and cons.  I watch this film for: Nic Cage's amazing performance, Aaron Standford's perfect interpretation, the versatile and awesome fight scenes, top-notch writing, and the fresh/original style of the film.  The final two seconds of the film makes me cringe with dislike, but the previous portion of the film is fantastic.  It is a shame that Kick-Ass didn't get more recognition, because it's better than most films out there.<br /><br />On blu-ray, Kick-Ass rocks!  There's a reason why it topped the charts when it first came home, and that's because it's an essential to any blu-ray collection.  No matter what type of audience member you are, there is plenty of room to enjoy Kick-Ass.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|Shipped on time. They fit on nice and do their job well. The only reason I dropped to 4 stars is that it make the entire R2 and L2 triggers feel slightly different when used. It take some getting used to (this is NOT a flaw in the product just a side effect!)

0312370849|2.0|Having been interested in Holocaust fiction for almost as long as I have been reading, I had high hopes for this book which had often been recommended to me. Unfortunately, quickly into the book, I found myself disappointed by de Rosnay's writing. Her modern character, Julia Jarmond, was uninteresting and evoked no emotion in me whatsoever. I would much have preferred it if the book was solely centered around Sarah, the small girl who wants only to find her brother after being sent to a concentration camp. I must give de Rosnay credit for creating a compelling and empathy-evoking character in this young girl. Her story was incredibly sad and upsetting. However, I did not find de Rosnay's writing to be anything but ordinary, making this book less than what it could have been. If Julia Jarmond was eliminated, perhaps I would have enjoyed this story more. All in all, this was a disappointing read, and for historical fiction- lovers out there, I recommend that you stay away from this book.
1441866868|5.0|Every year when the short list for the Hugo comes out, I try to take the time to track down and read all the finalists.  I may not have a vote, but I can at least judge for myself which book I'd give my support to.<br /><br />Also, it's not a bad way to enjoy some of the best genre fiction out there.<br /><br />This year's list included \\"The Windup Girl,\\" a novel that has been on my to be read pile for far too long.  I've heard friends rave about it.  Then, it made the short list and then it tied with \\"City and the City\\" for the award.<br /><br />So, better late than never, I got around to reading it.  Or in this case, listening to it on audio.<br /><br />And let me tell you that everything you've heard is true about this book.  It's dark, it's unrelenting and it's one hell of a compelling read.  Set in the near future with a society that has been corrupted by various forces, \\"Girl\\" makes some compelling, fascinating choices that are dark and will keep you reading.  In many ways, this feels a bit like \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" (the new one) did on TV--dark and unrelenting.<br /><br />I can see why Hugo voters gave it the nod for best novel of the year. It's one of the best novels I've read (or listened to) this year.
3836501910|5.0|If you're looking to buy a Terry Richardson book then you already know what you're getting yourself into - and you won't be disappointed.  For everyone else, I recommend doing your research on Terry before buying this book so you can really decide if it's for you.  It's vulgar, vivid, perverse, intense, creative, playful, dirty, disgusting, degrading, and everything else beautiful in this world.  I highly recommend this, especially for the price.
B003YOMNCM|3.0|Hilary Hahn plays brilliantly in these performances of the two concertos. I think she ought to get a new producer, however, as the orchestra completely dominates the performance.  The soloist was frequently drowned out.  If one lowered the player volume so that the orchestra did not blow out the windows, then the solo part was barely discernible.  If then you raised the volume to hear Hilary play, the orchestra would come in way too loudly.  What a shame to have such historic music ruined by someone asleep at the switch.
1592402690|5.0|Maybe it's because I'm a Beatles fan as well as someone obsessed with the art of recording, but I found this book riveting. Emerick has a gift for blending technical details of recording and engineering, his personal life, and anecdotes about the Beatles and what they were like to work with into a smooth narrative. It was like being there, like living through him.
B004132HZS|5.0|Having been watching Sherlock Holmes since I was a little boy, I always loved the stories.<br />Of course I always thought of Basil Rathbone as the quintessential Holmes, but now that I'm grown up, when I see a Basil Rathbone /Holmes movie, I realize how dated and silly they were.<br />The Sherlock Holmes movies have mostly been contemporary, like Basil Rathbone's Sherlock fighting the Nazi's, so it's with delight I welcome a twenty first century Sherlock.<br />It's also very welcoming to have a fully competent Dr. Watson join the team, I always thought that Nigel Bruce was done a disservice, in that he was made to appear incompetent.<br />I can hardly wait for future episodes.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Although I've seen other versions of this film, this is the one I enjoy the most, probably because I enjoy the nostalgia of the classic black and white cinematography and the \\"Hollywood Era\\" stars. There are colorized versions of it, but because I grew up with the black and white version, I prefer the latter.<br /><br />A very young Natalie Wood stars as the little girl Susan who doesn't believe in Santa Claus, because her mother has decided she should grow up practical and realistic about the world.  She's so dear and so precocious you can relate to her instantly.  Her attempt to learn about the Imagi-nation by imitating a monkey is classic.<br /><br />Edmund Gwenn is the ultimate Khris Kringle--although I did enjoy Sebastian Cabot's version also.  He's charming and loveable in the role, and whether you believe he is who he says he is or not, you definitely like him.<br /><br />Maureen O'Hara is at her most beautiful in the post war fashions of the 40s and is the thoroughly modern woman of her era.  A divorced, working Mom with no illusions about the world and the people in it, she gives Santa a greater task than her daughter does, since it's not just Santa in which she has lost faith.  This film was made in 1947 only a few years after the end of World War II, and women had only just achieved a degree of \\"can do\\" status because of their war time participation, so the film has some pretty interesting things to say about society.  Generally speaking, divorce for any reason had been considered a bad thing and divorced women had often been socially ostracized, so this is a great departure from earlier social norms.  The fact, however, that she is being encouraged to \\"believe\\" in Santa and abandon her pragmatism and independance may well be part of the move to return women to the \\"good old days\\" where their only role was the household.  Certainly the 1950s would see a far less light handed attempt to force women back into the home and subservience and convince them that they were a little too stupid to actually deal with life outside of it--at least in film.  This was more due to a radical about face of the film industry under the very real political threats posed by conservative elements during the McCarthy era than it was to the realities of life during the period.  Like it or not, real life would never be that simplistic and certainly by the 1960s both society and the cinema saw all \\"hell break loose\\" from the top to the bottom of society.  For a little while at least, there was a little warmth and charm at Christmas.<br /><br />A wonderful Christmas classic.oo stupid to actually deal with life outside of it--at least in film.

B002EWD0I6|5.0|This series has a breath taking cinematic character and a feeling for the quieter dramas of human life as it is more often lived, against the background of worldwide change and generation by generation.  Though few of us actually shape the \\"big picture,\\" our lives and those of the people around us definitely shape the track upon which these events occur.  Like the effects of drops of water on the contours of the earth, our attitudes, willingness to cooperate, even just what we choose to purchase or not, has an impact on what the world becomes.  It may take a while--though with mass communication how long it takes has significantly shortened--but our individual choices shape history in ways we will probably never know.<br /><br />There is an intensity brought to the everyday lives of these characters by some very superb acting; so much is this so that one has only to view one episode to have opinions about them, about their behaviors and about what they \\"ought\\" to do.  The restrained passion between Sir Timothy and the postmistress, Dorcas, are wonderful, with so much conveyed by looks and polite behavior that the story is virtually before the viewer without its having to be blatantly related.  We are so certain we understand the unspoken drama that finding out the details is actually a surprise.<br /><br />The stunningly beautiful Lady Adelaide is superb as the over bred and well born wife in love with her husband, of whom she suspects an at least emotional unfaithfulness with the postmistress but about which she feels incapable of dealing effectively.  Her efforts to understand and fit into the life of her husband, a rural aristocrat, remind one of the classic film [[ASIN:B001D8W7EU Rebecca]] where there is a similar \\"blundering around\\" without guidence, though in this case the lady actually is a \\"Lady.\\"  The difference between the expectations of urban and rural roles is dramatized very well in this single character.  Expecting a life of urban social obligations including the theater, balls, formal dinners, etc. in the competitive and cut-throat social milieu of London and for which she would be more than adequately prepared, she is instead thrust into the more primitive social obligations of dependant tenant farmers and day laborers and local tradesmen, with none of whose every day realities she is even remotely familiar.  Though we don't always approve of her respones to the situation, we can certainly sympathize with her situation.<br /><br />The sisters Pratt are the epitome of those with a tenuous hold on their place in society as \\"gentlewomen\\" without independent means who must make their own living as seamstresses.  Their secrets hold them hostage to the prejudices of society and shape their attitudes towards others.  They assume an arrogance toward people of lesser means, an obsequious manner toward those of greater and make every effort to \\"get the goods\\" on anyone of equal rank to have ammunition against them in case of need.  All of this makes them less than admirable individuals, yet their fear of falling into the lower ranks of society by virtue of their father's character is not without foundation.  Yet it is precisely their perpetuation of the prejudice and unfairness of their society that puts them in peril.  Many of their activities, however, make them more comedic figures than sinister ones, which gives them a certain grace despite themselves.  Their tendency not only to overdress but to do so identically, makes them seem a bit like a pair of court jesters!<br /><br />Just as with the Pratt sisters, Caroline, the multipara and expectant \\"lost cause\\" is delightful.  Her totally illogical approach to life and her optimism--if not totally realistic--are wonderful.  Her situation is virtually untenable, but she keeps going despite it.  If some of her schemes don't materialize, it is not without trying.  That she drinks is not surprising.  Certainly her alternative is dispair, depression, and probably suicide.Her explanation for being in debtors court is brilliant and true, if not entirely honest, and leaves one thinking of ones own credit card debt and financial situation.  Her sense of being \\"untouchable\\" after winning her case, leading her to enlarge her indebtedness should remind us of ourselves.  Twister, the lazy husband of Queenie the beekeeper, is another comedic character.  One senses that his youthful self was probably far less pleasant, but that time and perhaps dementia have mellowed him out a lot.  Some of the most poignant scenes involve him and his wife.<br /><br />The rigidity of social class structure and the expectations made on the various strata of it are also made apparent through the expectations of the two villages.  The \\"upper class\\" town of Candleford attempts to defend its privileges and looks to the future with greater acceptance, while the working class town of Lark Rise attempts to demand its rights under the law and fights fiercely for respect of its simple dignity.  Having been on the short end of the stick for decades, if not centuries, it looks upon the approach of change with suspicion.  Yet beneath all of this rivalry, when the chips are down, each village comes to the aid of the other.<br /><br />A wonderful group of people to spend time with.ebtors court is brilliant and true, if not entirely honest, and leaves one thinking of ones own credit card debt and financial situation.

0802473156|5.0|The main idea behind this book is that just as people have unique personality preferences, we all have unique preferences for what we find satisfying and motivating when it comes to love. Your love language is the way that you most feel loved and cared for. The problem is most people love how they want to be loved, and that doesn't tend to align with how their partner wants to be loved. So, you have to learn to speak your partner's love language. The author also believes that focusing intently on speaking the love languages will rekindle relationships where people don't even seem to like each other anymore.    My only critique is that they didn't focus more on understanding and discussing your emotions. For this you and your partner should read [[ASIN:0974320625 Emotional Intelligence 2.0]]. It did wonders for my husband and I.    The relationship expert who wrote the book arranges the book into the five love languages, and provides quizzes to help you determine which language you are:    - Words of Affirmation:  If this is your love language, you feel most cared for when your partner is open and expressive in telling you how wonderful they think you are, how much they appreciate you, etc.  Basically, they find ways to remind you that their world is a better place because you are in it.    - Acts of Service:  If your partner offering to watch the kids so you can go to the gym (or relieving you of some other task) gets your heart going, then this is your love language.    - Affection:  This love language is just as it sounds. A warm hug, a kiss, touch, and sexual intimacy make you feel most loved when this is your love language.    - Quality Time:  This love language is about being together, fully present and engaged in the activity at hand, no matter how trivial.    - Gifts:  Your partner taking the time to give you a gift can make you feel appreciated.

0756405890|4.0|A zillion reviews for this book so I will be brief. Really enjoy it. Last few books I liked were Brandon Sandersons Elantris and the Mistborn series, and before that the bourne books. I put this down for a few days, then picked it up again and loving it. The hero battles the bad guys and bad stuff, and though it is a very thick book, I feel like it is almost at the end and surely I am only a small way into the story? A few interesting turns that make it a bit different than the standard formula. The rich guy who keeps tripping up the hero I find a bit annoying. Stick it to him and move on. Still reading. rate a 4 out of 5.
0307592839|3.0|I give this three stars for its inventiveness, though I did not enjoy it. I love William Faulkner's books, so I am no coward. However, this one tried to go Faulkner one better, and failed badly. I should say up front that it has appeared on several lists as one of the best books of the year, so maybe I missed something. I agree with the reader who said the so-called power point pages, 75 of them, are not really that but words inserted into circles, triangles, squares, rectangles, etc. In my humble opinion these can be skipped. The author uses text-message-ese too much. Readers who do not \\"text\\" will invest a lot of time trying to figure them out. Then there are the time changes in each chapter. The same characters appear at different ages, and there are too many characters to keep straight. One chapter ends, and you turn to the next without knowing where the hell you'll be in the scheme of things. Faulkner does this well, Egan doesn't. I wish I hadn't bought this book, and I have a doctorate which should have assisted. My wife, a compulsive reader, would not have enjoyed this book. I am not saying that this story should have been told in a linear time fashion--Faulkner rarely does. But if you don't love Faulkner, you won't like this book.

0316098337|5.0|Brilliantly written.  Heartbreaking..  Completely terrifying.<br /><br />Room is on almost every Best of 2010 list that I've seen...and it will probably be on my own as well.<br /><br />I'm not sure I am able to give a synopsis of Room my own without giving something away, so go below and read that first.  And then forget it and just go read the book.<br /><br />I did not read the synopsis before I decided to read Room.  Instead, I spoke to someone at Little, Brown about Room and begged her to send it to me, which she did.  And then it sat on my shelf.  I was afraid of what was inside.  Why did I ask her to send me this book?  I lie awake at night torturing myself about the horrible things that happen to children, why would I choose to read this book and torture myself even further?<br /><br />Finally, it started creeping into the Best of 2010 lists, and I tried to talk myself into reading it.  Last month, I presented it to my book club to read with me.  Strength in numbers.  We have yet to talk about it fully, but I am sure they can not deny that no matter how difficult the topic, the book itself was genius.<br /><br />Before I write anything else, let me assure you of one thing. Jack, the boy, was not physically harmed in any way in this book. I wish someone had told me that before I picked it up...I would have had a lot less anxiety turning those pages. I hope I didn't ruin any of the tension for you, but I felt I had to put it out there.<br /><br />Emma Donoghue wrote Room from the perspective of Jack, a five year old boy.  This alone is a wonder.  Everything to Jack is new.  Everything we take for granted in our day-to-day lives...like a sidewalk...is foreign to him.  His relationship with his mother is all he knows.  Yet, we see so much through his eyes that would go unnoticed through our own.  This is where the beauty lies.<br /><br />Even though Jack is telling us his story, I read this book and really felt for Ma.  She kept it together as best she could for Jack.  She was his mother, his teacher, and his playmate, but no one could be expected to be strong each and every day for five years, not even for your son.  She was only human...and some days she was barely human.  When given the chance to be her own self, she felt guilty and Jack had a hard time letting her even take a shower by herself.  My heart broke as much for Ma as it did for Jack.  Yet, I don't think the story would have had the impact had it been written from any other perspective.  Jack didn't understand...but we did.<br /><br />You will be moved and you will not forget this book long after you put it down.his playmate, but no one could be expected to be strong each and every day for five years, not even for your son.

That being said my expectation was lowered (always a good thing) and 'lo and behold I loved every second of this wonderful movie. Similarly styled to Sin City (and in my opinion Sin City had more style than content) but full of fantastic action scenes that make it worth every cent. There is a storyline and its engaging enough.    As my title suggests, disengage your brain and I dare you not to enjoy this flick.
B001JV5BIA|2.0|Do you like sick movies?<br /><br />The plot is basically this:  two teenage girls are on their way to a rock concert.  They are kidnapped by a really sick group of escaped convicts.  These guys torture, mutilate, drug, and rape these girls.  This is a movie that may require you to detach yourself from what you're seeing on the screen in order to minimize the negative impact it might have on you mentally.  In other words, view it as just a movie in order to soften the impact.  On the other hand, one really doesn't need to TRY to detach themselves and downplay everything because the acting and music in this movie will do the job for you, because it's THAT BAD.  When I watched this movie, I found that I was getting a big kick out of the poor acting and especially the music.  The music alone served as a distraction away from the sick brutality that was on the screen.  Let me tell you, the music is THAT BAD.  The movie is bad to begin with, but the music just totally seals its doom.  The music is very cheesy - it reminds me of music you'd hear on some TV show from the early '70s, like maybe The Partridge Family or The Brady Bunch, something along those lines.  The music doesn't fit the movie at all.  To further illustrate, imagine watching The Waltons and having John Williams' Star Wars soundtrack playing.  That's how much the music doesn't match up.  To make matters worse, there are scenes that are meant to provide comic relief, but they end up making me laugh at the actors who are trying to provide the comic relief.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that has that late '60s/early '70s hippie counterculture feel to it, where it seems the characters are on an LSD trip and the movie itself is psychedelic in nature.  I wonder what drugs Wes Craven was on when he made this movie.  Then again, maybe he wasn't on drugs.  Maybe he just wanted to make a sick and disturbing movie.  Whatever the case, this movie isn't one I recommend.  It's a cult classic and even a remake was done recently, but no, I certainly don't recommend the original., but no, I certainly don't recommend the original.
0756405890|2.0|I bought Name of the Wind after reading a few pages from a borrowed copy from my college library.  For that span of about twenty or so pages that I initially read, the story started perfectly poised to become an epic fantasy novel that should have been hard to put down.  Unfortunately that was not to last long.    Once the story removes itself from the present time and Kvothe starts relating his story to the chronicler, the pace of the book plummets as if from the top of a multi-storied building, hits the ground, and then just stays there.  However, this is not to say that the book is sub-standard from cover to cover.    Some of the story is very well written.  The related mythology that is weaved in is quite well developed.   I enjoyed reading the back stories.  The use of magic and alchemy are very different and refreshingly unique.   However, the world-building and the character development are fairly shallow.  Even his love interest becomes a boring dance after a few iterations.  Some parts of the story seem irrelevant.  Most of the story is simply a recounting of Kvothe's daily life interjected with Kvothe frequently and explicitly reminding the reader about how talented he is.    Kvothe not only excels at every subject in the university naturally, he also continues to \\"fast forward\\" through the different levels because he is just *that* talented, while every other student has to pay their dues and wait their turn.  As if that weren't enough, Kvothe also shows tremendous talent as an accomplished musician.    He also possesses an extraordinarily quick wit which he uses to get himself out of every problem he gets into.  During the first few incidents I was glad about this;  once it became a pattern however, there was never a question of if, only of how.  This made for a boring read.    It was this overblown, larger-than-life appearance which made him a superhuman poster-boy character who I just could not identify with.  I  continued reading in the hope that boththe story and Kvothe would find a direction.  Both, however, remained lost and the story, for the most part, remained a mostly daily, conceited account of Kvothe's life and ended on the ever-pervasive flat note.  While I toiled through Name Of The Wind so I could give a qualified opinion, I do not envision myself continuing on to read Wise Man's Fear.

B0019N8P2W|4.0|I loved watching Daria on MTV and was excited when the series was available for purchase.  Getting a t shirt with the dvd set was an added bonus and I loved that it had a saying from the first episode printed on it.  I was disappointed that the dvds do not display the titles of each episode.  You only know what episodes are on each dvd after you put the dvd in and go to main menu.  Most t.v. dvd sets like The Simpsons or Family Guy feature the title and brief summary of each episode in a booklet or on the back of the dvd container. The Daria set does not. Also there is a techincal error on my last dvd where the screen is black and it sounds like a scene from a movie was recorded on it but that lasts about 30 seconds.  I love Daria but I think more thought could've gone into a better quality dvd set for the show's longtime fans.

'Bratty B' screams for some punk guitar and a harder drum sound.  And the echo in the vocals is great but doing that in _every_ track makes them all sound too similar.  I'll be interested in hearing what they do next.  5 stars though is being ultra generous.

B003Y5H4SO|3.0|Although M. Night has the talent to showcase his characters horrors and reactions to shock in his films. The one thing that he repeatedly seems to not fully disclose, is the villain itself. If you like to be teased into conjuring up your own creature, monster or demon in Shyamalans films and love the sheer thrill of not knowing exactly what it is attacking, possessing or killing off the victims in his films, he is for you. Myself, I get tired of getting glimpses or hints of what it is exactly bringing horror to the actors faces and in that, we almost always get an hour or so of mostly facial reactions and responses that only in the end, disappoint the viewer when the villain surfaces. In \\"Signs\\", the alien(s) only get minutes of the audiences eye; in \\"The Village\\", the creatures turn out to be fake; in \\"The Happening\\", the horror was an invisible nuerotoxin that forced people to commit suicide and in this film, the \\"Devil\\", gets no screen time except at the end when \\"it\\" wants to collect the final soul in the elevator and when an elevator camera forms an incomplete demons face. Shyamalans films cannot be defined as horror films until we can actually see the \\"horror\\". M Nights films are repeatedly monsterless films!
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|This has been quoted as \\"the best Disney film since The Lion King\\", and by God, it's really true. Putting the Disney/Pixar films aside for a minute (we all know they're the future of Disney and cartoons in general), let's step back into the realm of 2D animation. The Disney of the 90's left us with some truly terrific animated films including The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King, and after that they left us with some not-so-great ones. In fact, since Toy Story was released in '95, I don't think there's been a single traditionally drawn cartoon produced and released theatrically worthy of greatness at all. Even The Simpsons Movie, which had seemed destined for greatness since its conception, fell flat on its face in the wake of the CGI revolution. It was as if all the good stories were being put on hold specifically for computer-generated cartoons.     Now I must admit, there probably weren't many people less interested in The Princess and the Frog when it first started being advertised than me. Not only was I well past the age of seeing a Disney movie without the name \\"Toy Story\\", but the concept itself brought nothing but skepticism to my mind. \\"They've changed the original story's name?! And they made the princess black?! And they're doing it in 2D??!!\\" were the first thoughts to enter my head, and they stayed there until I actually watched the movie from beginning to end. Boy, was I wrong to be skeptical. This is a true Disney Classic.     The story really isn't all that groundbreaking. Everyone is at least somewhat familiar with the prince-turned-frog who needs the kiss of a princess to be human again. It's the same basic thing here; but it is the characters themselves that truly make this a masterpiece. All of the voice acting is superb, the humor is just right, and the romance is heart-stealing. In my opinion, the pedestal is overtaken a little bit by the supporting characters. Louis, the trumpet-toting crocodile; Mama Odie, thenew take on the fairy godmother; and of course Ray, the Cajun firefly madly in love with \\"Evangeline\\" (who just so happens to be the wishing star from Pinnochio) are some of the best original characters Disney has yet to come up with, right up there with Lumier and Cogsworth. And if you harbor any sentimentality for love stories, prepare to have your heart broken and re-warmed several times.     If you were ever a fan of the old Disney movies, do yourself a favor and see this one. There are plenty of skepticisms about the Voodoo themes and the Louisiana Bayou setting, but they're entirely in vain. The magic in this movie is no more offensive than Ursula's magic in The Little Mermaid, or the Fairy Godmother's magic in Pinnochio. And if you have any reserves about the racial implications of the movie, get over it. This truly amazing work of art deserves at least that much.

0143038583|5.0|Michael Pollan is a journalist, and an omnivore, curious about where the food he puts in his mouth comes from. In the book he follows four meals from the very beginning of the food chain to his plate. The discussion begins with CORN. Part one of this book is shocking. I knew corn was the main crop grown in America and that farmers growing it are in big trouble, requiring government subsidies just to stay afloat, but Michael Pollan unravels how it got to that point.    After leaving the farm, most of the corn finds its way to the Confined Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) where it is fed to cows, pigs, chicken, turkey, and now even fish. This is problematic due to the fact that cows aren't built to eat corn. They eat grass. This unnatural diet leads to various health problems for the cow that must be countered with a cocktail of antibiotics and hormones, creating more health problems for us.    He follows the corn from the field to the supermarket, where it now infiltrates virtually every processed food on the shelf. I had no idea that corn is broken down and recombined into hundreds of different forms, most notably oils, high fructose corn syrup, and xantham gum (never knew what the hell that was). Just take a look at the food label of any processed food and your probably eating some scientific form of that kernel of corn.    He followed the corn all the way to his meal at McDonald's. Between Pollan, his wife, and his son they packed in 4,510 calories for lunch. The items that contained the highest proportion of corn turned out to be the soda (100%), milk shake (78%), salad dressing (65%), chicken nuggets (56%), cheeseburger (52%), and french fries (23%). And we thought we were eating such a varied diet. As Pollan points out, we are simply industrialized eaters surviving on corn.    Part 2- GRASS  Part two focuses on the organic movement. Everyone thinks they're making a wonderful decision to eat organic and in one sense they are, saving the soil from all of the synthetic fertilizers and pesticides (although some crazy stuff is still allowed under US organic laws). There are the obvious health benefits of not ingesting those things. The dark side is that the bag of Earthbound Farms baby lettuce mix you just bought traveled 3,000 miles in refrigerated trucks using untold amounts of energy. Organic started out as a local movement, but as demands increased, it was forced to industrialize. Supermarkets don't want to deal with several smaller local organic farmers. They want one large buyer to stock all their produce needs. Big Organic is now a 350 million dollar business.    Part 3- The Forest  His final meal is from ingredients derived from Pollan's owe efforts through hunting and gathering. He realizes this is an unrealistic option in terms of our daily eating, but he wants to undergo this experiment to bring him closer to the food he eats. After hunting wild boar, gathering mushrooms from the forest, collecting cherries from a tree in the neighborhood, he discovers what is for him, \\"the perfect meal.\\" Why perfect? His meal would not have been possible without the number of people that helped him in his hunting and gathering endeavours. It was an open food chain. He knew where all the ingredients came from and their were no hidden costs. \\"A meal that is eaten in full consciousness of what it took to make it is worth preparing every now and again, if only as a way to remind us of the true costs of the things we take for granted.\\"
0553805371|5.0|This book was almost the first book of its kind that I read. It was fantastic and full of interesting information for me. I didn't see much of a connection between this book and god (I mean even if we don't know where the big bang was coming from, still thinking of a god would be the laziest answer). I see this book more of a survey on the subject (physics and especially modern physics), which is explained in a very simple and understandable manner. But if you happen to be a physics major and have a deep knowledge about modern physics, you might only find few pages of this book to be really new to you (if you find any).
B002ZG98J6|1.0|The book was awesome. Hands down. A great book. I loved reading about the greek gods growing up. Good adventures. The stories of Hercules, the Iliad, the stories of Hermes... they were all truly awesome stories.  Mr. Riodran has done what JK Rowlings has done. He has taken a world that we are all familiar with... reintroduced it, creating a fantastic ride of adventure. A true treasure of a book.<br /><br />The movie... was awful. The entire story line was changed. The entire plot rearranged. Sub-plots became the major plots and the major plots became sub-plots.  They took out several major characters, including Ana-Beth and Ares.<br /><br />This is the third movie that I have seen directed by Chris Columbus - the first was HP 1 the second HP 2.  Columbus did what he did with the first two Harry Potter movies.  He ruined it. Destroyed it. There is no excuse for the creative liberty he took this time - because the books were fairly concise and they needed no changes.  The readers loved the book - why did you have to ruin it?!<br /><br />A shameful excuse to make a few bucks. Horrible directing - for the simple fact that he pretty much rewrote the entire book.<br /><br />Dissapointed. A shame that something like this was approved and allowed to be produced. A sham because the people who read this book will never know the real joy or enchantment of Mr. Riodran's writting.<br /><br />If I could give it no stars - I would.
142311339X|5.0|Like many others who loved the Percy Jackson series, I was a little skeptical about reading this book.  The biggest question was how it would compare with the original series.  After finishing this book, I've decided that this book exceeded all of my expectations to a sequel of the Percy Jackson series.      This is also a great book for middle school students to read.  I brought this book into my classroom in hopes of drawing some interest in the other books in the series and this book has done even that.  Not long after the first of my students borrowed the book, word got out that I was the only teacher on campus that was letting students borrow it.  After that, there were students visiting my classroom everyday to ask if the book was returned.  This is an excellent book to get students to enjoy reading.

B002F6FQGK|5.0|Pipes AND lyrics, to boot: I highly recommend the album, aptly-titled \\"Lungs\\" by the band Florence + The Machine; especially the song \\"Dog Days Are Over\\". The artist's incredible, lilting voice, combined with the biting lyrical witticism of her music, makes for addictively hypnotic listening - you'll want to play it again and again. The quality of Florence Welch's serenading is stunning, and her vocal range is immense. The originality of the music, combined with its incredible pace and rainbow-like auditory layering, makes me feel like I am in the middle of the coolest rock concert ever - right in my own living room. Thank you for sharing this music with me, Matthew. - Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.
074322454X|4.0|It is a rare experience for me to come upon a book that eventually spun off a movie that was inferior to the movie.  Such is the case with this book.  Don't get me wrong: I quite enjoyed the book and those pages were flying by. However, the HBO series is also one of those exceptional cases that so many of us have enjoyed....whose dramatic production eclipsed the source material by several factors.  I am tempted to say the same thing about the HBO series on John Adams but the book it comes from is equally sensational.      The story told by Ambrose has all of the material and then some that eventually show up in the HBO series.  But, the story does not grab you in the same way that the series does.  It comes across sounding flat and that's unfortunate because when the same stories or vignettes are dramatised they are very gripping and often heart stopping. His book does not suffer from a lack of research but the manner in which it was told was not overly impressive.    I was glad to have read it and the summary section in the back, which tells us what happened to the surviving members is sometimes quite sad to read and in the case of Sobel, the man who was largely responsible for hardening these men into what they eventually became....turned out very badly.  What one comes to realize is that had Sobel been allowed to lead his men into the drop on DDay.....he and many of them would have been killed unnecessarily.....he was not a combat leader in the least bit.  His men knew this and unfortunately for him, he was in denial of that reality all the rest of his sad life.      What was rewarding to read was the universal love and admiration the men of Easy Company felt towards Winters.  A truly remarkable man of very deep roots, he was also that rare person who could shut off and let go the raging man of war that he had to become when an active soldier and instead lived the life of a quiet, calm and peaceful civilian without remorse, guilt or self doubt.  He was turned toover the years by his fellow mates for solace and guidance and they could not have turned to a better man.      A good but not great book but an essential companion to the nearly perfect and stupendously wonderful HBO series.

B001FB5634|5.0|There's something about the name Eli that lends itself to post-apocalyptic films. Like The Book of Eli, The Road features a visually impaired character named Eli who foresaw the apocalypse, the younger generation brings him hope in a way he never thought possible, and Eli grapples with the question of God's plan. But what is God's plan?  That's a question that has bedeviled humanity and it is asked by an old man named Eli. It is asked in every sweep of the blasted landscape, every exchange between father (Viggo Mortensen) and son (Kodi Smit-McPhee), and in every fire lit, \\"fire carried,\\" and shot fired.<br /><br />It's easy to dismiss The Road as too grim, as hard to watch, as a real downer, but The Road demonstrates the value of hope with single-minded determination.  The father represents the xenophobic, inward-looking, white collar fear of the world caving in.  The worst has happened, and the man flails as he tries to keep the boy alive.  The boy, on the other hand, is filled with hope and longing - he wants to make friends, he wants to play with other kids, and he wants to be with his deceased mother (Charlize Theron).  In other words, he wants to be a typical boy.<br /><br />The acting is superb.  Mortensen is all too-believable as a crazed father on the brink.  Smit-McPhee is pitch-perfect as a child who alternately explores the broken world and fears it because his father fears it.  Throughout, the father tries to toughen up his son, preparing him for a hard-luck existence when he's gone. Every parent with a child can relate.<br /><br />Central to The Road is a battle of ethos. Who should you be: The naïve dupe who trusts anyone that says they're trustworthy?  Or the untrusting sociopath who shoots first and asks questions later? We begin life as the former and slowly become the latter...because our families, our friends, and the world teach us the folly of trust.  But it's those same people who teach us that trust is a very part of our survival. When times are tough, friends are a precious commodity.<br /><br />At its conclusion The Road asks: Is blood thicker than water? Your answer will determine your perspective at the end of The Road.a precious commodity.    At its conclusion The Road asks: Is blood thicker than water?

0312600844|2.0|Let's face it: Patty Berglund is an incredible bore. She is a terrible mother, wife, neighbor, and lover. (I nearly added daughter, if her parents weren't even worse.) Why does that matter? Because a big chunk of this novel is her alleged `autobiography'. While Franzen obviously can write, see for instance the first part called Good Neighbors, he used his writing ability to write her text boringly, which may be in character, but is not a service to me, his reader.<br />I ask you, is it a good strategy to spend 35% or so of a book writing in a boring style? I would even doubt that it is a convincing female style, if there is such a thing. It seems to me more like a flat text written by a man who impersonates a woman.<br /><br />This is a novel about family life, politics and careers in middle America. It was published with much fanfare due to the author's previous success with Corrections, which I remember having read with some pleasure, but which I mostly forgot immediately.<br />Is the new novel worth reading and will it stick in your memory? I doubt it.<br />It is in essence about the freedom to fail: as friends, as couples, as parents, as sons and daughters, in sports, in politics, in careers. Everywhere. A new American passion?<br /><br />Parenting is a hugely difficult job. Most people fail in it. Patty Berglund's parents, the Emersons, failed with her, and she is failing with her own kids. The Berglund family, contemporary middle class people with two children, move from St.Paul to Washington. He is a lawyer, first in a corporate job, then in a not-for-profit environmental organization. He has ambitions, but gets stuck in the multiple agendas of his patrons. The family survived reasonably well in their St.Paul neighborhood as long as the kids were children, but is on the rocks after the teenagers stop needing or wanting parental attention.<br /><br />The first part of the book a hearsay description of what happened in St.Paul, like a collected gossip from neighbors, written in witty sentences. Then `the autobiography' of the woman, more direct, no jokes. Awful problems with her parents, with a party rape, with college friends and drugs, with her lover. Patty's first obsession is her dead end career as a college basketballer. A boring subject. The second is her love interest, her husband's best friend. Not much more interesting, even if the man is a depressed musician who reads Thomas Bernhard. Almost everybody else is also depressed.<br /><br />The third part then begins with a focus on the musician and his special kind of craziness. This could be the motto of this part: Few things gratified depressives more than really bad news.<br />We move on to depressed Patty's frustrated son Joey. Then to her loser of a husband and his losing battle, trying to make use of petroleum, coal and gas money in the interest of conservation. Mountain-top removal coal mining in West Virginia, harnessed towards saving a specific warbler species. Had about enough depressions yet? I did. But I slugged on.<br /><br />The book is not stupid, and it is well constructed, but it is cold as ice. At least I never warmed up to it.<br />More important: is it true? Does all this make sense? Do we believe the people in the story? I have serious doubts.Then `the autobiography' of the woman, more direct, no jokes.

It tries too hard, and as a result, it's laughable. It reminded me of the Towering inferno. I fell asleep watching it.
1932100660|4.0|This book is full of problems.  For the best rebuttal to the argument that I've found go to letthemeatmeat.com, the official rebuttal source of Dr. Campbell.  Dr. Campbell is likely on to something but makes a weak case for it.  He extrapolates too much and conveniently ignores some established benefits to animal products.  Another good rebuttal site would be Rawfoodsos.com, and associated links for rebuttals.<br /><br />That said, the book is well worth reading.

B004AYCWY4|3.0|I did like the book - and I enjoyed the stuff I learned in it.  It is just a bit wordy.  What he ultimately says is interesting, but it was a bit of a slog to get through. I did enjoy it, just almost gave up at one point.  I guess the reason why is because I felt like I already knew this information and getting into variations on what I already knew seemed like a bit of a waste of time. However, it was interesting and I learned some new things I didn't know before. So I have mixed feelings about the book.  Liked it but as far as a book about evolution I enjoyed Your Inner Fish WAY more.

The book starts out so happy and carefree, but after things take a turn for the worse for Mia, it makes you take a look at your life. I also really liked that it gave insight to Mia's life as she is looking back at it. It helps you see the connection between her and her family and friends.  It was an all around wonderful and thought provoking book.
1603425381|5.0|Aesthetically, I am loving this book without reservation - very well photographed, illustrated & explained instructions.  From a working standpoint, I am a newbie to crochet and get a little intimidated & leery of trying new designs.  However, following Ms. Eckman's advice on page 14, I resist panic and persevere, learning to trust the process. I will confess to being so excited about all the designs that I've bypassed reading the instructions fully, which Ms. Eckman takes into account on page 36!  I will be using this book for inspiration & reference for years to come.
B00430EQK8|5.0|This is definitely NOT your father's Ring!<br /><br />If you're looking for a traditional version of Wagner's Ring of the Nibelungen, this is not the place to start.<br /><br />Here is some of what you will see in this DVD sampler of Wagner's Ring:<br /><br />Rhinemaidens in transparent water tanks<br /><br />Wotan and the Valkyries appearing suspended in space, flying around as they sing (They're on sort of hydraulic lifts that resemble forklifts with cage-like platforms on cranes.)<br /><br />Spheres or globes of bodies swinging like a pendulum<br /><br />Loge flying around the stage on a segway<br /><br />Siegfried's Rhine journey in a stylized silvery boat, passing mountains in the background, and with water in the foreground<br /><br />Erda, the Earth Mother, appearing to float in air, with a rotating globe of the earth spinning behind her<br /><br />Strange as these descriptions sound, they seem to work to give the audience the perspective of eternity and universality--not just dated in some early Teutonic time period.  Just as Wagner tried new approaches at all levels of theater, the \\"La Fura dels Baus\\" stage directors have broken new ground in this really new production of the Ring.<br /><br />Zubin Mehta conducts the Orquestra de la Comunitat Valenciana in a fine rendering of Wagner's gorgeous music that will bring tears to the eyes of involved Wagner devotees.<br /><br />The \\"extras\\" section discusses how the stage director \\"paints\\" the scenery using computer-controlled projected picture screens on stage.  The Blu-Ray picture quality and sound are excellent.  My wife says the dogs were frightened by some of the floor-thumping sounds.<br /><br />It is a really unique production, and I think it's wonderful that a DVD is offered as highlights to allow buyers to preview this approach before investing in the complete Ring.  To be honest, I wasn't sure I'd like such a novel approach, but they won me over.  This is the way to make up your own mind.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Great holiday film for the whole family. Superlative animation and special effects. The classic story may be an old one, but it will always be the best and most beloved tale for many decades to come.

0345479092|4.0|I got this book in desperation, seeking advice on handling my crying/screaming newborn.  I will say that I still have a crying/screaming newborn.  BUT, with some of the tools in here, I feel like I'm better equipped to handle him.  There is a chart of signals a baby will give & what these mean, which I found helpful as I think I was misinterpreting some of his cues as being hungry.  I also liked the explanations of setting a schedule and giving a bath, as well as how to approach your newborn (taking your time vs rushing).      I didn't mark this down a star for my baby still crying because, well, I didn't expect a miracle.  BUT, what I do wish the author would address more is how to handle taking your baby to daycare.  The examples in this book were entirely stay at home moms or people who didn't go back to work for an extended period of time.  For a lot of us working mommas, we have a pretty short time home before returning to work.
0375842209|5.0|I came across this book as an assignment for an English class of mine; however, after reading only a few pages, I realized that this was not just another one of those \\"kill me now\\" books--I was completely caught by this book.  As you can tell from the numerous reviews made for this book, it is about a young girl who is displaced in Germany during WWII.  The story is told from the view-point of Death as he tells of the young girl's pleasant yet horrible life growing up under the Nazi regime.  However, it also tells more than that.  The story tells of the power and beauty that lies in both words and life.        This book was just simply amazing, and Zusak has definitely done an outstanding job.  This is a definite must-read, and I would recommend this book to anyone.
B003UESJH4|5.0|A cynical reviewer would suspect that those behind \\"The King's Speech,\\" own a dogeared copy of \\"Oscar Movie Making for Dummies.\\"  But a honest one would admit they succeeded admirably. From the first scene on, there's never any confusion about how to feel or who to root for.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing.       Colin Firth stars in this true life story of King George VI (at the start, the Duke of York), who consulted Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), in order to cope with a pronounced stammer and fear of public speaking. Logue is well, quirky.  He insists on first names, even with royal clients.  He makes the Duke visit his office and deal with his bizarre elevator.  He even plops himself down in St. Edward's chair in Westminster Abbey.  If you can imagine.      If you've seen \\"Ordinary People,\\" or any Hollywood movie about therapy, you know why he's doing this, and you can predict the course of the treatment, its final outcome, and its effects on both therapist and client without trying.  This does not, however, lessen the impact of the film.  In addition, if you're a classical music lover, it has a great score.    All the cast does a terrific job, even those who have the narrow \\"bad guy\\" roles. This includes Guy Pearce, as the older brother who abdicated the throne for the love of a twice divorced woman, also showing scars from a less than nurturing childhood.       Thoughts on the heroes of  \\"The Social Network,\\" vs. \\"The King's Speech,\\" (both Best Picture Oscar contenders).    While it may seem sacrilege to suggest that a man who led a nation through World War II, and a guy who betrayed his best friend to start a billion dollar company have anything in common, both (in the movie version) do.  Both are portrayed as being suspicious of other people's motives, quick to take offense where none was meant, and lacking empathy for those who are trying to be their friend.  And both movies do an excellent job of showing how this attitude, not just the newfangled wireless or Facebook, only isolates the person further.  The difference is that while \\"The King's Speech,\\" provides a back story which makes it easier to empathize with the protagonist, \\"The Social Network,\\" forces the viewer to take its hero at face value. I'm not sure which is the \\"better\\" movie, Oscar-wise, but I think \\"The Social Network\\" is a braver one. If less satisfying.
B000Q31L4U|5.0|The Polar Express is a wondrous piece of movie making, destined to join the ranks of must-see Christmas classics, for children of all ages. I have read numerous reviews. Some say this film is too dark. Really? No darker than the original illustrations that accompany the author's masterpiece book. I would call it very atmospheric. Other reviewers don't like some of the animation effects. Well, overall I think the producers did an excellent job using animation to create and sustain the larger-than-life feel of the story. If it has been shot in regular film, I believe it would have lost a lot of its flavor and impact. Just like a good watercolor or acrylic piece of art has much more evocative power than a photograph.     The bottom line is that Polar Express is a great story, and the essence of Van Allsburg's classic has been very faithfully rendered in this movie, and in so doing, the people who labored to do so should get a lot of credit (especially considering the garbage that passes for holiday movies these days). This is about the innocence, faith and wonder of childhood and how it is stoked (and sustained) by the magic of the Christmas Season. I defy anyone with a heart to sit and watch this movie with some young children and not get choked up during the last 10 minutes or so of the film, after Santa makes his entrance. I guess those who aren't moved by this film have long stopped hearing the beautiful ringing tone of the bell. But I'd bet anything that your great-grandchildren will be watching this movie with their kids at Christmastime, along with It's A Wonderful Life, Christmas Carol, White Christmas, Rudolph, and a few others.
B002ZG976U|5.0|So many movies are worth watching once but this one is pure entertainment and worth watching over and over and over again.  After seeing it twice at the theater I can't wait for it to be available on DVD.   If you enjoy great singing and dancing then this movie is for you.  There aren't many musical movies made any more and this one is just plain fun with the exceptional voices of Cher and Christina.  The soundtrack is a keeper too.  I highly recommend this movie.
B004CEUEWE|1.0|a bad,  overrated, cheesy piece of junk that's more like a feature-length made-for TV soap opera than a regular movie, which never, ever should've made it into the cinemas at all, in the first place. Yet, The Town is good, in that it has made for much lively discussions on various movie forums, including amazon.com and others.  I also realize that, in order to get the democratic society that we all long for, different viewpoints have to be aired, no matter how much at odds they may be with each other.    The cast is mediocre at best, the plot and story are overused, the Boston accents, especially on the part of Ben Affleck, are forced and way overdone, and the chemistry between Doug and Claire is non-existent to paltry, at best. One of the most, if not the most bothersome aspects of The Town is the message that it clearly conveys; People don't have to be accountable for their actions and behaviors; that it's okay to steal and rob innocent people of money that they don't deserve to lose, to terrorize, permanently maim, put innocent bank employees and customers' lives and safety at risk, to abet an armed felon and wanted fugitive (Doug MacRay, the ringleader)to escape the law by getting involved romantically with him, allow him to buy expensive Tiffany diamond necklaces for one, and make utter dupes of law enforcement people who've been assigned to bring guys like Doug MacRay to justice and end their robbery careers once and for all, by lying to the Feds, and tipping an armed felon and wanted fugitive (Doug MacRay) off to them and helping them escape, and that it's okay to take the law into one's own hands and to kill a couple of people just because they threatened to do Heaven-knows-what to a girlfriend, or whoever. I think it's totally wrong.    Oh, and why is it okay for good-girl Claire to receive stolen goods and spend that ill-gotten money on the renovation of a seedy hockey rink and dedicate it to her criminal boyfriend's mother who she never knew, instead of arranging to turn it into the police anonymously?    Hey...come on! Doug put the romance moves on Claire when he met her, in order to shut her up and warn her oh, so subtely not to talk to the Feds or else! One's supposed to think that Doug really loves Claire and is attrracted to her by her winsome personality, but nothing could be further from the truth, imo. He found Claire attractive, in that she was clearly vulnerable after being traumatized by him and his guys after they held up her bank at gunpoint, and therefore quite gullible and open to exploitation. Almost as soon as Doug got what he wanted out of Claire (a promise not to go to the cops or the Feds), he left the money in her garden and skipped town for Florida, because he was on the lam from the law and couldn't elope with Claire and exploit her as a bargaining chip, the way he'd wanted to do. Yet, there's another reason why Doug left Claire behind when he skipped town for Florida instead of taking her with him; Doug's days of hiding out down in Florida in a house overlooking a bayou were numbered, that sooner or later he'd be hunted down and caught, perhaps violently, by the Feds, and at some level, both he and Claire must've known that. It was especially obvious when FBI Agt. Frawley said to Claire \\"You know the FBI is a national organization\\", and then requested that the descriptions and photos of Doug MacRay be circulated. Isn't it funny how the vast majority of people, either naively or in willful ignorance, miss all of the above!    It's funny how most people don't realize that Doug was a sociopath who totally exploited the women in his life; Krista for sex, and he left her with nothing, even though he knew she had a young child to take care of (who might or might not be Doug's), and Claire, who he thought he could elope to Florida with, but could not, after having charmed her into trusting him and then worming his way into her heart so that she'd shut up and not talk to the Feds. One is supposed tosympathize with both Doug and Claire, but, in reality, neither of them deserved any sympathy.    Imho, when the Feds had Claire and Doug meet at her Charlestown condo in a last-ditch effort to nab Doug MacRay and send him off to a Federal penitentiary for his crimes, the Feds should've made Claire keep her big fat trap shut, not call Doug or answer any of his phone calls, and let them do their job of arresting Doug and bringing him to prison for his crimes.    Doug deserved to end up in a federal penitentiary for his crimes, and Claire deserved to be criminally prosecuted herself, or at least put on some sort of probation for abetting Doug and for receiving stolen goods (Doug's illl-gotten heist money).    I'm sorry, folks, but I cannot bring myself to be sympathetic to either Doug or Claire, who, imho, turned out to be the most dislikable, and annoying characters in The Town. I also think the fact that Claire quit her job as a bank manager after the robbery without telling anybody, including the Feds, is also rather suspicious. What most people don't realize is that Doug is an armed felon and wanted fugitive who's on the lam from the law, so he's not going to Florida on vacation. Happily, there's no way that he and Claire will ever meet again, which is what the final \\"I'll see you again, this side or the other\\" sentence in Doug's \\"goodbye, I'll always love you\\" letter to Claire before he skipped town for Florida means, but the fact that Claire didn't turn to Frawley for help after learning the truth about Doug and reallizing that she was in over her head, is beyond stupid, and wrong.    The fact that Doug and Jem beat the crap out of two Dominicans from a housing project who'd supposedly thrown bottles at Claire when she'd been stupid enough to walk by herself through a housing project (no woman in her right mind would do that, at any time of night or day) and permanently cripple them, especially since they didn't even tell the two Dominicans why they are beating him up, shows that underneath that smooth, sweet-talking, gentle veneer of his, Doug, as well as Jem, is a man of unprovoked violence, and more like his incarcerated father (who, btw, is serving several life sentences in MCI-Cedar Junction for bank robbery and murder) than he would've liked to admit. My, my...Lady Claire must've felt flattered that two armed felons who were also wanted fugitives from the law came to her defense! Pretty sickening, this whole thing.    This is something that still continues to dog me, even though I've written about it so many times.  Why, oh why do so many people fall for such a hyped-up, cheap, overrated, trashy movie such as The Town, and, more to the point, refuse to accept dissenting opinions on it?  It beats me...I don't know!    I admit to one thing, however:  The Town left me rooting for the cops and the FBI, especially Agt. Adam Frawley and wanting them to catch Doug MacRay and his men  and send them to jail for their crimes, and to have Claire either criminally prosecuted herself for being an accessory to Doug's crimes and for tipping him Doug off with a \\"sunny days\\" code and enabling him to elude the law as well as her receiving stolen goods, or at least put on some sort of probation for her bulls***.  Sure, I sympathized with Claire at first, because she was the victim of an armed bank robbery, which wasn't her fault, but I completely lost my sympathy for her when she not only got involved, wholesale, in  a romance with Doug, but refused to sever all contacts with him even after she learned through Agt. Frawley who Doug MacRay really was, and what he was up to..  Unlike most people, who are sympathetic with Ben Affleck's character in that film, and with Claire, I am not.    Why should I be sympathetic to either Doug or Claire?  The idea that Doug MacRay wanted to change and redeem himself through Claire is utter bulls***, especially after he engaged in an act of vigilantism by taking the law into his own hands, going back toCharlestown, and gunning down Rusty and Fergie just because they threatened Doug's ladygirl Claire with physical harm.  Come on now! Doug MacRay's still a criminal and he was not the decent guy he came across as when he and Claire met \\"by chance\\" in a C-Town laundromat.    Doug MacRay, like his friends and partners in crime, are not only skilled, disciplined and ruthless in their quest for quick money through parasitic behaviors such as armed robbery, and who'd unquestionably kill or seriously injure people enough to put them in the hospital if they're considered obstacles to what they want, but Doug knows how to come across as a nice guy, when he's really not.  He may not be crazy like his best friend and righthand man, Jem, but he's a sociopath and a person of unprovoked violence just the same.  The fact that he came across as such a nice, charming guy and deceived Claire by pretending to be an upstanding, law-abiding citizen, when he's really not, is more than disgusting...it's part of his criminal behavior.  As for Claire, the fact that she took Doug's bait and rose to it is pathetic indeed.    If Doug had really wanted to change, imo, he would've turned himself and his guys in, come forward, negociated with the Feds for some protection for himself, been sensitive and caring enough to realize that his actions and behaviors were putting Claire in danger and let her go, and then stopped robbing banks once and for all.  Doug left for Florida without Claire for two reasons:    A)  Doug MacRay was an armed felon and wanted fugitive who'd been on the lam from the law for quite awhile, plus he'd just killed Fergie and Rusty.    B) Doug had gotten what he really wanted out of Claire all along;  a promise from her not to turn him in, which he got.  How can so many people be so naive or willfully stupid as to miss that?    Also, if Doug wanted to redeem himself, he would've come forward, served his time, and  after a prison term, found honest ways to raise the fundingfor the renovation for the C-Town hockey rink himself, instead of using Claire Keesey as a go-between.  What people don't realize is that Doug wasn't a nice guy...even to Claire, even though most people firmly believe that he was.  The fact that he deceived her, seduced her and made a total fool out of her was vicious.  The fact that Claire acted like a poor, confused, dumb-assed adolescent and allowed herself to be manipulated, made a fool out of and taken advantage of by Doug is pitiful, but she doesn't deserve pity, due to the fact that she helped the very guy who turned her life upside down and caused her a ton of grief in the first place escape the law.    As for Kristina, well, I don't like her sordid lifestyle or behavior (drug and alcohol addiction, sleeping around with too many men, and the fact that she was in the business herself by helping to book hotel rooms and get costumes for Doug and his men, and being a drug mule for Fergie and Rusty), but i'll say this:  I feel kind of sorry for Krista, in a way, because she had far fewer choices than Claire;  she'd grown up with Doug and Jem, who, like many other men, abused and exploited her for their own ends.  Krista's daughter, Shyne, still an infant, caught in the middle of all this s***, was innocent, and I felt sorry for her, too.    I'm so sick of people saying that what the white collar criminals (not defending them, btw) are worse than guys like Doug MacRay and his gang, because it's unrelated, and not true.  Neither the book Prince of Thieves, on which The Town was based, or the movie, make any effort to get at causes of bank robbery and other crimes, and the circumstances  under which Doug and his men had grown up under.  Moreover, the movie asks the audience to sympathize with Doug MacRay and his men, as well as Claire, who acted stupidly enough to allow Doug to take advantage of her, and who became an accessory to his crimes, while considering law enforcement officials assigned to bring criminals like MacRay and company to their knees and have them locked up in penetentiaries once and for all.  Dez was a smart (he was college-educated and had a regular job) but stupid guy;  he was pretty much just along for the ride, and did what he was told to do by the gang, and yet, at the same time, he seemed to be pretty much their victim, as well, if one gets the drift.  Dez allowed himself to be taken for a ride, also.  At least the book fleshes out the characters and spends more time on Dez and Krista, and doesn't focus on the viewpoint of Doug and Jem so much, plus the book takes a far less sympathetic outlook towards Doug and his men.  Sorry, folks, but I can't bring myself to like this film, except for the very beginning.      The Town also normalizes the Stockholm Syndrome and its inverse, the Lima Syndrome.  One doesn't have to be in any of the helping professions (i. e. psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, etc.) to realize that, while a person who's taken hostage and falls victim to the Stockholm Syndrome (i. e. falling in love with her captor) or the Lima Syndrome (i. e. accepting the overtures of her captor, who falls in love with her), presumably has a better chance of survival in a hostage situation, the victim, in either case, is turned into a person who is at her captor's beck and call, is manipulated and controlled by him, and is essentially brainwashed into believing that her captor cares enough about her not to kill her, and that he'll always treat her kindly and not abuse her.  This couldn't be farther from the truth, especially because, all too often, the victim is isolated from her friends and loved ones, and begins to blame law officials and other authorities, as well as loved ones and friends for her troubles and turn against them rather than her captor who committed this criminal act against her in the first place.    Common sense is required, in order to at least minimize the possibility of having something like that happen to him or her;  Just because one meets a charming guy or gal, especially in a laundromat, doesn't mean that they're necessarily out for any good, particularly if one is in an area that's known to be tough, with a violent history to it.  Anybody who meets someone that they've never seen before, no matter where they are, or how charming they may  be, should be much more careful, and not be so quick to accept dates with someone or get into things with people they don't know that well.    Claire was a woman who used no common sense what. so. ever, and she ended up having a breakdown when it finally backfired on her.  Hey...if I'd known her in real life, I'd tell her..\\"Hey..don't you understand that if you play with fire, you're going to get burned? Think about that!\\"    Supposed the bank manager hadn't been as angelic-looking as Claire, or had been someone with a learning/developmental disability such as autism, Aspergers, dyslexia, ADD/ADHD, or a seizure disorder?  Do people honestly believe that Doug and his men would've even acted the least bit charming and sympathetic towards her?  I personally don't think so.  Doug would've allowed Jem and his other men to do whatever he wanted with her, and she probably would've been gang-raped or \\"offed\\" by Doug and his posse of armed criminals.  Don't kid yourselves, folks!    Doug, contrary to how he came across to Claire, wasn't a nice guy, even to her.  He was playing her, and anybody who thinks that Doug and his men wouldn't have killed her if she'd resisted and refused to comply with them is just kidding themselves.     Edit this post   Permalink

B000JMKQX0|1.0|Unfortunately I have to say I was disapointed with the book. I am a fan of horror books, and really like the zombie theme and was expecting something easy to read and interesting. The book is a collection of \\"interviews\\" with survivors, with sounds cool and all but in the end turns out to be the biggest flaw. To put it directly, the author is just not good enough to pull of the trick. Instead of leaving with the feeling that you heard numerous voices, it is like all of the different characters are the same, they sound the same, despite being from completely different backgrounds. A classic case of a good idea poorly executed. Especially in the case of far fetched histories like zombie apocalypses the writing has to be good to make you believe in the characters, and for me this is just not the case here.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|This movie worked the best yet, viewed from 3.7 feet from asus 24\\" 3d monitor with 260.99 drivers. The presentation had mostly depth in the movie as is common; However, this one had the most forward projection I've seen in a film yet(comparing to cloudy with meatballs and monstars vs aliens). Its a good story and enjoyable for old as well as young viewers. If you had a 3d tv and you had only 35 dollers to buy a 3d bluray I think this film would be a great starter film.

I won't go into spoilers here, there are plenty of books out there with plot reviews, suffice it to say, I hope to read everything this author creates if all her books are this good.

B003ZVJFFM|1.0|My 10 year old son and I sat down to watch this movie . . . we were so disappointed.  First, there are scenes in this movie I wish my 10 year old hadn't seen.  (Watching the \\"Ghost of Christmas Present\\" turn to ash and bones isn't a delightful Christmas experience, for example.)  Second, Jim Carrey . . . he is typically awesome.  Apparently, they didn't let him make the part his own.  Scrooge stunk in the movie.  Finally, the animation falls FAR short of what one normally expects from Disney.  My opinion: save your money . . . I, and my son, absolutely hated this one.
0143036270|5.0|Over the course of one's life one has to come to terms with how one deals with minor and major setbacks.  In addition, one has to ultimately confront the major issue which all of us will one day face, and that is our death.  Marcus Aurelius' Meditations provide sobering and pragmatic balms for both of these matters.  On reacting to life's circumstances, Aurelius is abundantly clear that a person has full control of his or her mind and can choose how to respond to whatever comes his or her way. Even physical pain is something that this stoic mindset can endure, knowing that the mind need not succumb to the exigencies of the pain.  Aurelius concedes that a stoic mindset is not necessarily inborn, but can be developed with exercise.  This mindset comes from understanding one's nature and the individual's relationship to the rest of existence.  For a modern Christian, and even a humanistic individual, this approach to life may seem to steer one away from dogmas and beliefs about the nature of man and his role in the universe; nevertheless, I believe that one can still adopt the components of stoic thinking that work, without compromising one's spiritual or religious beliefs.  Indeed, Aurelius' meditations are grounded in the belief in God, though often in this translation, which makes sense since he was a Roman emperor in the 2nd century, Aurelius refers to the gods and Nature.    Aurelius contends that death should not be such a conundrum.  Either you return to the state of non-existence from which you came, in which case you will be as unaware of your non-existence prior to your birth; or, from his perspective, the gods have created a world where all works together for the ultimate good of everything.  In this schema, anything that happens, even your death, is directed to an overall good, both for yourself, in terms of your soul and after-life, and for the planet and all life.  As a Christian, I firmly accept the latter, though I obviously do not attribute it to the gods, as does Aurelius, but to a God and to His mercy and wisdom.    Since reading this book I have been more at ease in accepting those inconveniences and frustrations that come each day, knowing that it is my response to them that ultimately determines how I feel.  There is a lot more to be mined from the Meditations, and I expect to pursue them further with the aid of written commentaries or other media.

Its about one man's vision of the perfect loaf, how to make that loaf, and how to make slight modifications of it. But that one loaf is spectacular and understanding it is understanding the modern model of high hydration doughs. The book is gorgeously illustrated with so many pictures you can almost make the bread by pictures alone.     And if you ever get the chance to go to Tartine and get one of his breads, do it. Regardless of how well you can make one yourself.

0756655730|5.0|I gave this book five stars because it is easily one of the best books on prehistoric life that I have seen.  It is not as comprehensive as some would believe.  Where for example, is that giant dragonfly that is rarely ever omitted from a Carboniferous diorama?  There is no mention that the mass extinction at the end of the Ordovician period was likely caused by radiation from a star in our part of the galaxy going nova.  A little more historical geology would be helpful in understanding the extinctions and the remaining species diversifing into new species to fill the suddenly open niches.  This book is primarly as the cover flap says, a catalog of prehistoric life.  Since it is a reference book, I don't have a strong desire to read it cover to cover.  It is arranged mostly in geologic time rather than encyclopedia style so it could be read that way if desired.  After having read Stephen Jay Gould's \\"Wonderful Life\\" and Donald Johanson's \\"Lucy\\", I find myself flipping this book between the bizarre arthropods of the Cambrian and the hominin timeline. Since the state I call home boasts one of the best series of Paleozoic strata on earth, I'm glad this isn't just a dinosaur book. Prehistoric Life, is as some other reviewers said, a reference book that is suitable as a coffee-table book.  It is something to flip through during commercials or when you suddenly realize that you saw that show before or for your guest to flip through during an otherwise awkward moment when you go to fetch coffee.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!*    What an amazing book! I was so excited when I heard that Mr. Riordan was writing a new series, and this book certainly did not dissapoint!

I was happy to find that you still have some of the old charcters you know and love like Annabeth and Chiron, but man do I miss Percy! I think that the combination between new and old characters was pure genius because, for me at least, it made the whole thing even more worth reading!

1439133948|5.0|Bujold is in the set of authors whose books I can grab without looking at the flyleaf for a plot summary. Her books are guaranteed good reading; I've never had less than a 4-star experience. With Cryoburn, I had no \\"Hmm, how many stars shall I give this?\\" self-examination. Cryoburn has all the story elements that made me -- and probably you -- fall in love with the Miles Vorkosigan series.<br /><br />It's sort of pointless to try to summarize a Bujold book because the initial setting often has little to do with where the characters end up, or at least telling you a lot of detail makes me wary of spoilers. In short, though: Miles is kidnapped while attending a conference about cryonics -- a topic near-and-dear to him since (as fans will remember) being deep-frozen and later revived is how he coped with being shot with a needle gun a decade ago. He escapes from his would-be captors (that isn't a spoiler; you find that out in the first 10 pages)... and naturally that's when the adventure begins. Unlikely allies, diplomatic compromises, clever repartee -- it's all here. (\\"Where there's smoke, there's fire,\\" he says. \\"Or at least mirrors.\\")<br /><br />If you were a previous Miles Vorkosigan fan but have lost some enthusiasm for the series, never fear: This is back to the just-plain-fun of the first novels. I liked the the last few Miles books and wanted to know what happened to him (at least while I was reading the book) but some of the relationships got a bit confusing. This one is back up to 5 stars -- it's clear who the good guys are, and the humor is ahead of the \\"Hmm, how WOULD that technological change impact business?\\" thoughts. Among the things I love about Bujold's writing is that the humor isn't all superficial; she DOES make you think about the sociological effect of a technology like cryo-statis, and addresses it far more intellectually than does Heinlein in [[ASIN:0345330129 The Door into Summer]]. But meanwhile you just want to find out what will happen next, and chortle occasionally.<br /><br />I think you could read this novel out of order; you probably do need to have read one or another of the books to have a sense of the main characters (not the least of which is Miles' previous career) but if you haven't read all of the books you wouldn't be confused at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ccasionally.

B0043RSE2M|4.0|Like many of the other reviewers mentioned this was a good movie with a heartwarming storyline and probably the best 3d I have seen so far.  However there seems to be a strange problem with the packaging of the movie.  I received my four disc combo and the outer cardboard sleeve stated that it had a digital copy, but when I removed the sleeve the plastic case cover called it a three disc combo and left out the digital copy.  I contacted Amazon Customer service with the problem stating that I didn't want to return it I just wanted to notify them of the problem.  I received a response less than 15 minutes later staing that they were sorry and that they would refund 1/3 of the price I paid since I didn't want to return it.  I must say that amazon customer Service is excellent and they resolved my issue immediately.  I think this is a fairly common problem since other reviews mentioned it so I would definitely check to ensure that you received the digital copy if you ordered it and if you didn't contact customer service.

It is none of these things, but it approaches their border. The team is led by a cigar smoking colonel who focuses on the end goal of every mission. The team members are \\"Face,\\" who is handsome and attracts women like flies on honey; a bear-like man who can be quite fierce, but is afraid of heights; and Murdock who is at least a little crazy and has been institutionalized at least twice in the film for his craziness. The four are duped into participating in a heist to rescue counterfeit money plates and are arrested. They escape in a dramatic manner and uncover the plot. There is much action in this film and much humor.

It's the book you give to your friends when they show interest in the subject but don't necessarily want to read all of the underlying science and annotated history.  Readers who are still skeptical can proceed to Good Calories Bad Calories for additional evidence.<br /><br />Should you read this book?  The answer is simple.  Do you believe in \\"diet and exercise\\"?  Do you believe fat people would lose weight if they just got out of the chair and walked around a little more?  Do you believe we get fat because we consume more calories than we expend?  Do you believe consumption of low-fat foods will keep you from gaining weight?  Do you believe foods high in saturated fat are harmful and will increase heart disease, cholesterol, and body weight?  If you said \\"yes\\" to any of these questions, then it's probably a good idea to read this book.

0307592839|3.0|I agree with many of the reviewers in that the stories, while compelling and entirely readable, do not quite link together seamlessly.  Linking together stories by character instead of theme is something that doesn't normally appeal to me, and the constant time shifting just didn't work for me either.  I'm no stranger to complex novels or short story collections, but this one just didn't \\"flow\\" in the way that I had expected.  I had a difficult time staying engaged with the characters.  I did, however, enjoy reading about Bernie and Sasha- The storyline about the music business was by far the most compelling and memorable.  No doubt that Egan is a talented writer, though.  Perhaps it's just not my style.
0765350386|3.0|I read this book after somebody commented that Sanderson's series was one of the best ever. While the premise is interesting and the book is easy to read and holds your attention, I felt it was more superficial and lacked the richness of other novels (Martin, Hobb, Carey). Certainly, I wanted to know what happened in the story, but I never felt like I really cared about the characters. It's like a good summer blockbuster movie. Entertaining, but nothing to rave about.    p.s. My uncle opened the book and was appalled by the writing as he said it was wooden. He couldn't believe Sanderson is a popular author and immediately went to research reviews online. My judgement is not nearly so harsh.

B004DK5CYM|5.0|When I say this is a family film I mean it!  My grandson is Jacob Rhodes and he plays the young John Tweedy in this movie. So having this DVD is a must for me. Great movie too.  I could watch this one overe and over!
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Great movie, pretty much a guys movie, but girls will enjoy it because of the story. The plot is direct and to the point, which leaves a lot of room for action, which there is. The story will draw you in especially if you have kids. Me and my girlfriend love this movie. It looks great in HD also 5 Stars.
1579126278|5.0|I have read Ackroyd, Styles, And Then, and Orient. Ackroyd is most definitely the best one. Following Poirot from the Doctor's perspective is fantastically fun, and the ending has a very unique twist which I have never seen, or at least delivered so well, in other books.     I'm glad I read Ackroyd last because it left me with the best impression of Christie. I don't think I shall read anymore Christies for fear of ruining that impression.
B000022TSW|4.0|This is so friggin hallarious! It's definately not a kids movie but if you ahve a crude sense of humor (or any at all) this is a kick ass movie!
1400079144|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"The Lost Symbol\\" by Dan Brown.  It was a fascinating read, gets you hooked immediately!  Couldn't put it down, kept reading and reading and reading.  So many twists and turns in his novels--loved it!
B00454U1NS|4.0|I realize that most artists do not place all their singles onto their Greatest Hits packages, just the ones that chart the highest.  While \\"Greatest Hits ... So Far\\" definitely captures the magic of P!nk's career, it does leave you longing.  Immediately I noticed \\"Most Girls\\" and \\"You Make Me Sick,\\" both hits from her first CD, missing from this package.  They may not have charted as well as \\"There You Go,\\" but they were big hits nonetheless.  Also missing is \\"God Is A DJ,\\" her second single from the Try This album.  From I'm Not Dead, the single \\"Nobody Knows\\" is missing.  And, for whatever reason, her ballad hit \\"I Don't Believe You\\" from Funhouse is present on the CD version of Greatest Hits that includes the DVD, but not the other one.  I'm not sure how these decisions are made.    Other than that minor complaint I have no real problems with this package at all.  I considered simply downloading the new tracks from Amazon as I have all of P!nk's other albums, but I like the packaging and feel it's important to support the artist, especially if it's a favorite artist.
B003WTE886|3.0|I recently bought Taylor Swift cd.  I thought it was ok  The cd has some good songs.  But there are a few songs that you want to skip over.  I expected it to be a better.  I have a couple of Taylor Swift cds that are really good. But this was not her a usual standard.
B000002AHC|5.0|For me this the finest of all the Byrd albums.  \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\\", #49 in 1968, was a failure in their catalog, but that doesn't mean the mateial on this disc is bad, far from it.  Roger McGuinn, Mike Clarke(last album until '73), Chris Hillman and David Crosby (who existed during the recording of this album. (His picture on the cover is replaced by a horse)!  This was their 5th album, here are the album highlights:  It leads off with the Beatleish \\"Artificial Energy\\", about taking speed.  The Goffin-King classic \\"Goin' Back\\", #89, love the melody, best version of this song(mho).  \\"Draft Morning\\", with sound effects by the Firesign Theatre, Crosby had the idea, a haunting Byrd track, great subtle bass by Chris Hillman.  \\"Wasn't Born to Follow\\", another Goffin-King track, would of fit perfectly on the \\"Easy Rider\\" album in 1969, Clarence White plays guitar on this track.  \\"Get to You\\", mellow melody, a Byrd classic.  \\"Change Is Now\\", country sounding tune, with some fine riffing by Clarence and David Crosby.  A re-make of their own  \\"John Robertson\\", this version had some fine cello's, very British sounding.  \\"Tribal Gathering\\", about the \\"Human Be In\\", in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, love the fuzz guitar on this track by David.  \\"Dolphin's Smile\\", another Bryd effect tune with Roger's fingernails on the neck of his Rickenbacker, making the sound of dolphin's.      The bonus tracks:  \\"Triad\\", David Crosby wrote this while still with the band.  Band didn't like the subject matter at the time, so they put it on the shelf, and David walked.  The Jefferson Airplane recorded it on their album \\"Crown Of Creation\\", sung by Grace Slick.  This is David's only vocal performance on the album.    \\"Goin' Back\\" (version one), a slower version then the original album, problems sinking in with Crosby at the time. (still a fine version).    \\"Draft Morning\\", a longer alternate version.    \\"Space Odyssey\\", a song Roger would be known for on other albums in his solo career. A sea chanty type tune, very spacey effects with the moog.    \\"Moog Raga\\", Something else for 1968, the moog doing some type of indian music.    \\"Bound To Fall\\", fine instrumental, some good guitar by Roger, written by Mike Brewerfrom the group Brewer And Shipley (One Toke Over The Line\\" fame).    \\"Universal Mind Decoder\\", instrumental of the \\"Change Is Now\\" melody, Clarence White's guitar, made for his stay with The Byrds for the next 4 years. The voice of the late Gary Usher behind the board.    The Hidden Tracks consist of,  the band in the studio and all the warts and ugliness comes out on drummer Michael Clarke. Don't play in front of your young kids, very vulger languish used here.  And Gary Usher doing a commerical spot for the album.    The Byrds would jump into country-rock on their next album \\"Sweetheart Of The Rodeo\\", in late '68.

B00005214X|5.0|I downloaded the Free Hi-Res Audio Track OF \\"Wah -Wah\\" from All Things Must Pass on the George Harrison official website. It is uncompressed, lossless 24 bit / 96kHz. Unfortunately it doesn't sound much better than the MPEG3 sample being played on the Georgeharrison website. So I burned it to a DVD-R and played it on my audiophile system, where the sound quality was also very disappointing. In fact the 30th Anniversary CD with \\"Wah-Wah\\" sounded much better. Of course this song is difficult to resolve because Phil Spector went crazy with his wall of sound on it.    Has anyone had any experience with these or the hi-res FLAC flies sold on the Paul McCartney Band On the Run website?  I queried the so called customer service, Topspin, for both websites. They are utterly worthless at answering questions about the products that they are selling.
B001DEAAIY|5.0|This 6-disk-in-tin-box Blu-Ray edition of possibly the greatest TV drama series ever made is the one to go for. Five disks each contain two episodes of the series and the sixth disk of extras includes extended personal interviews with surviving members of Easy Company to give the viewer the opportunity to appreciate how character-defining and life-changing were the experiences these guys went through in WW2, and how superb was Spielberg's and Hanks' casting for the series in managing to get the actors exactly right. Some even look like the real men they portray (Frank John Hughes looks so like the real Bill Guarnere it's actually spooky, and all surviving members of Easy attest to the fact that British actor Damian Lewis's portrayal of Dick Winters captures the understated integrity, intelligence and leadership qualities of their real-life CO to perfection).<br /><br />There's little to say about this epic, landmark drama series that hasn't already been said. It's essentially a true story based on the real-life recollections of surviving members of Easy Company through their paratrooper-training in Georgia through 1942, to their deployment to England in 1943 in preparation for finally jumping into action with the 101st Airborne on the night of 5-6 June 1944 as part of the first wave of the allied invasion of Normandy, through their subsequent actions in France, Holland (Market Garden), holding Bastogne against the Waffen SS during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, to finally confronting the horrors of a Nazi death camp in Germany and occupying Hitler's Eagle's Nest retreat in the Alps in May 1945. The drama is gripping, the action sequences utterly realistic and viscerally real, the character portraits complex, the dialogue rich, clich&eacute;-free and tinged with irony and humor. Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and the entire Dreamworks production company excelled in every way with this series and produced a kind of masterpiece which it is difficult to imagine might ever be equalled. The seriousness of the subject matter is treated with respect, and every aspect of the writing, casting, direction (each episode has a different director but you'd hardly notice, so seamless is the production and the continuity) and editing is flawless.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray edition looks and sounds superb, and brings an even sharper realism to the original TV series. It's very nicely presented with the quality befitting this superlative piece of work. Since Spielberg proved with \\"Schindler's List\\" in 1993 that he could make grown-up films for a grown-up audience he has evolved into a serious, mature and intelligent film-maker of the highest calibre, and BOB may prove to be his crowning achievement in a lifetime of first-class work (though \\"Pacific\\" might run a very close second).<br /><br />BOB is not just first-class, genre-defining TV drama: it's also a fitting, respectful testimony to a generation not just of Americans but of all allied citizen-soldiers who fought and eventually won the greatest war in human history against a ruthless and totalitarian enemy who needed to be defeated: the most obvious and probably the only acknowledged \\"just\\" war of the past century, undiminished from the perspective of our more fortunate but generally less principled times where current issues of good and evil are far more opaque.<br /><br />Respect, Easy Company. Spielberg's epic may cause your names to live forever, as they should.<br /><br />PS 11 January 2011: just heard the news today that the real Dick Winters died on 2 January, aged 91. RIP.e equalled.

B002MW50KO|1.0|From the sound of it, Ol' Bob will be getting one of those electronic voice boxes in his stocking this Christmas.  He sounds like an alien now ... how could it be worse?  But seriously folks, I look forward to his 2011 Holiday Album, which I understand will be a collaboration with Eric Cartman.  Now that will be one for the ages!!
B00003CY5J|4.0|This would be a pretty good \\"Heist\\" film, in fact I saw a film with that name just before seeing this, but I found the amount of hi-tech gadgetry to be an obstacle... c'mon fellows, you'd have to be a NASA-trained engineer to be able to use all of that stuff, rob THAT safe, etc. It's fun (if not at all original) to watch these guys strut their stuff, but I just found myself unable to suspend disbelief. NO-ONE could possibly do what these gentlemen set out to do. Sorry about that *Spoiler*     What really workede for me though was the relationship between the extremely talented Edward Norton, de Niro and Marlon Brando. They were all perfect for the rôle, as was the marvellous Angela Bassett. Great cast in the wrong movie? Probably, but you can still have a lot of fun working your way through all the twists and turns of what should have been a much better movie.
0307454541|1.0|I found it very difficult to get into this book and wish I hadn't bothered continuing to read it. The writing was very unsatisfying, even after the storyline finally picked up pace in the second half. With so many other great books out there, I would not recommend this one to anyone.
0525951652|3.0|I have loved Ken Follett's books from his earliest ones, like Key to Rebecca, which kept me up all night finishing it, to his last series set during medieval times, Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.  Fantastic.  His latest book, Fall of Giants, was somewhat of a disappointment, however.  Not in its characters which were many and varied - from the coal miners of Wales to the aristocracy in London, from the rugged peasants of Russia to real historical personages such as Lloyd George and Winston Churchill, from advocates for women's rights like Maud and Ethel to American aide to Woodrow Wilson, Gus Dewar.  So many characters of interest!  It was fascinating - amazing, really - how Follett intertwined their stories and made connections among them.    I have to say that I have never really studied World War I in depth.  It seemed like history classes never really made it that far, or if they did, it was in an end of the year hurry.  I learned so much from this book as far as why the war began, the atrocities on the battlefields, the inner political fighting and negotiating, and how each country felt about the war.  The reader is given an insight into the personalities of President Woodrow Wilson, Winston Churchill and Lloyd George.     The downfall of the book to me was the weightiness of the discussions on the political aspects of the war, before and after, often going on for pages.  I tired of it.  I just wanted to get on with what was happening to the characters; I wanted to go on with the plot without all the \\"history book\\" reading.    The story ends in 1924, just as Hitler has been arrested during the revolution in Munich.  After the war, Germany was forced to accept blame and they were given some tough consequences.  Life in Germany was hand to mouth for many.  The currency was worthless, food was difficult to find and expensive, and the people were downtrodden.  We are given a foreshadowing of the country's low tolerance for its Jewish citizens.  So, thenext book will undoubtably continue on with World War II.    Fall of Giants does give one a very strong look at what the war was all about and how all the soldiers, but especially the Russians and Germans, suffered on the battlefields from lack of food and proper equipment. It just wasn't one of my favorite Follett books, BUT I will be looking for the next one in the series!
B0041OOJNU|5.0|Definitely one of my favorites next to Pies Descalzos and Donde Estan Los Ladrones. None of the songs dissapoint because it's a good mix of her slow pop songs and plenty of her rhythmic songs that make me want to get up and dance. Great for Zumba classes or dancing around the house...Love, Love, Love...so glad she brought it back.
B00005R1N3|5.0|At Christmas time I like to watch White Christmas and I like to watch Black Christmas.  Actors Andrea Martin, Olivia Hussey, and Margot Kidder really do interact like a trio of sorority sisters and, when Hussey ignores the policeman on the phone and begins to mount the stairs towards the end of the picture, for once you don't start shouting at her, you understand why she would be reluctant to walk out of a house without her two friends.  (Irony!)  I don't know how much they paid Olivia Hussey to make this film, and from what Bob Clark said she only did it on the advice of a psychic, but they didn't pay her enough--she is far from the greatest actress in the world, but she really holds the movie together.  Her quiet strength and her compassion give the movie more warmth than its alhebraic plot (one character disappears every 10 minutes) actually has room for.  I always love the scene when carolers come and sing \\"Adeste Fidelis,\\" and Olivia Hussey looks entranced throughout the whole thing, and then, even in the middle of the panic about the murders, she remembers to run out to the kids and give the female coach some money (as a tip?)--now, that's classy!<br /><br />She looks genuinely moved at the music.  I relate this to the fact that Olivia Hussey also was later to play the Virgin Mary in the Zeffirelli version of Jesus of Nazareth.  Altogether she has had a much more varied screen career than her detractors would have one believe.  She has to do a lot of heavy lifting, as it were, to make her scenes with Peter work.  They just don't seem like they were ever a good couple, she's annoyed with him from the get go and he's a mess, although he gets to wear a splendid green, yellow, gray, black and brown houndstooth jacket when he gives his all-important piano recital.  Keir Dullea is of course a legendary presence in the 60s and 70s cinema, and every time he comes onscreen he brings with him the rags and tatters of all his famous roles.  Did you know he could really play the piano, and was a favorite student of Glenn Gould's (the two spent the off hours of Black Christmas hanging out in Toronto and attempting to rehearse Peter's shattering solo) and that the jacket in question was actually borrowed from Gould as a good luck charm?  Well, it worked.  Today listening to Peter's recital it is probably the most impressive segment of a really great score....  Keir Dullea grimaces when he hits a note by mistake...  or is that what his face is saying, because it sounds killer to me.<br /><br />Until the collectors edition DVD I never really understood the disconnect between what Billy says on the phone and the expressions on the actresses' faces when they react.  He says the most vile things and they just stand there po-faced, and then when he says something innocuous they let him have it!  Well, apparently the actualy Billy dialogue was recorded later and during the time of filming, Hussey, Kidder and Martin were just listening to a silent phone and prompted to react at different moments of the clock.  Although I don't know how they worked this out during the infamous \\"wart\\" phone call that upsets our heroine so.  Maybe that was one time in which she actually knew what was being said on the other end of the conversation.<br /><br />Is Black Christmas actually better than White Christmas?  Well, neither are high art type pictures, are they, but watched in rapid succession you might convince yourself that this really is the \\"most wonderful time of the year.\\"iano, and was a favorite student of Glenn Gould's (the two spent the off hours of Black Christmas hanging out in Toronto and attempting to rehearse Peter's shattering solo) and that the jacket in question was actually borrowed from Gould as a good luck charm?

B002ZG99NG|1.0|Bought this movie because I was misdirected by the trailers I saw.  Thought it is an all-action thriller, a movie that will keep you on the edge from start to finish.  Let me put it this way:  For every minute of action you get 20 minutes of drama, plain talk and boredom...  On a scale from 1 to 10, I have to try really hard to give it a 3.  But that's my opinion...
B0038W0OHQ|2.0|Here is my honest, unbiased, detailed review of the \\"Steelseries 7H Headset\\".    After waiting over a week, this headset finally arrived on my doorstep.  Unpackaging was simple, so I dived right into testing.  This headset was tested on a X-Fi Titanium soundcard.  I also used a 24-bit/96 KHz Burr-Brown DAC with dedicated headphone amp which I'll discuss later in the review.  I used various source material, mainly uncompressed 16-bit/44 KHz PCM WAV files, 256 KBit encoded MP3's, some high-resolution 24-bit/96 KHz WAV's, and a few games (mostly FPS shooters).    First, the Pros of this headset:    - Packaging is very nice.  Box is beautifully done, with multi-language layout.  Velvet mold holding the headset in place.  Wires, extra headphone cushions and advertisement pamphlets in separate bags.    - Headset is easily transportable.  Can be broken down into 3 pieces.  Headphone cusions snap off, allowing you to choose pleather cusions for isolated sound, or softer cloth cusions for a more open, airy sound.  Cord is detachable from the left earcup via mini-usb input.  Cord also comes with a 2 meter extension.    - Design wise, it is a nice looking headset.  Chrome accents, rotatable cups, and pleather headpiece accompany the large earcups.  Braided cord does not tangle, looks nice.    - The mic extends out of the left earcup and has unidirectional pickup.  It can be bent in any which way and will stay in place.  Quality was clear, overall good but not the best.    Now, the many Cons of this headset:    - As described by other users, the braided cord is a distraction.  When rubbing against clothes, it makes a scratchy sound that vibrates and echos inside of the left earcup.  This is very distracting and dispite the sound isolating properties of this headset, it can be heard clearly.    - Headphones clamp onto your head like a vise.  Very high resistance, something that will not go away due to \\"break-in\\".  This can be uncomfortable to some users, including myself.    - The size extendors do not stay in place.  Everytime I removed the headset, they snaped back into the smallest size adjustment everytime.  This is rather annoying, having to adjust the size of the band everytime you take off your headphones.    - The mic mute/unmute slider on the volume control pod is very loose and rattles.  It is clearly audible with the headphones on and is another distraction.    Finally, the sound quality, the most important part of the review.  This deserves the most attention so I'll go into greater detail:    Higher end midrange and the highs themselves are clear and undistorted.  The lower end, not so much.  In fact, it is non-existent.  Despite these headphones being advertised as \\"balanced for lows, mids and highs\\" and \\"good for gaming and music\\", this is not the case.  Bass extention is just not there.  Lower frequencies are inaudible.  I cannot stress this enough.  Even when using \\"Bass Boost\\", the lows are nowhere to be found.  Upping the cutoff frequency only added distortion.  Overall, this headset has a very thin, underpowered sound.  Something you would not expect for such a pricey headset.  Thinking it was a power issue, I outputed my sound digitally to a external DAC with a built-in headphone amp.  Screweing on the 1/4\\" adapter, I proceeded in further testing.  It made little to no difference.  Sound was just as flat.  Overall, the volume on these headphones is uncommonly low and only when the gain was turned up to 3/4, did the volume start to sound normal.    Concluding my review, I believe these headphones are of inferior quality and not engineered correctly.  For $129.99, you can get much better quality from proven manufacturers.  Save your money, buy something else.

Michael C. Hall is a gifted actor I first saw him in Six Feet Under another awesome series . I got this series ( Dexter ) on Blu-Ray witch is definetly better than DVD but not amazingly so . I feel that anyone needs to at least try this series or else they will be really missing out . The writters really keep you wanting more and maybe its the people behind this series that are the ones that need to be recognized the most .

B00338QENI|3.0|The author exposes the story of Henrietta Lacks and the hardships that her family faces after her death in her early 30s.  The book is told in 3 sections.  The first is about Henrietta and is based on interviews conducted by Ms. Skloot.  Henrietta's parents die young and she is raised by her grandfather.  She marries her cousin as a teenaged bride and has 4 children.  One child is epileptic and slow (due to inbreeding and syphillis) and is sent to an institution.  During her final pregancy, she discovers a hardness in her cervix.  It wasn't until well after the birth, that Henrietta is actually diagnosed.  Tissues from her biopsy are harvested and are the first cells that are successfully reproduced in the lab.    She endures horrendous treatments and radiation that burns her abdomen black.  During her final weeks, family describe the pain episodes and clearly she did not have the kind of pain medications that white patients would have at the time.  Her final words were to a family member to make sure Day (her husband) takes care of Deborah (1 year old child) and Joe (infant).  Unfortunatly, Deborah and Joe suffer sexual, physical and emotional abuse by family while Day is oblivious.    The family lacks education and is unaware that Henrietta's cells are being used (and Johns Hopkins is profiting from) for science.  They are poor.  The children miss their mother.  The family blames Joe's anger on the fact that Henrietta had cancer during his pregnancy and he \\"shared the womb with the tumor\\".    Eventually, they become aware of the cells through news articles and reporters/doctors who want to better understand Henrietta's story.  Understandably, the family is wary, however, Ms. Skloot is able to form a bond with Deborah and writes their story.  Deborah always wanted to find out what happened to her sister who was institutionalized.  She died shortly after Henrietta and the family never knew her story.  Sadly, it is uncovered that she too suffered horrendously and thedetails were both maddening and very depressing.    At times, the book is at times slow and often depressing.  The book brings up many issues around medical research on Blacks that were commonplace in the 1940-50s, but are clearly unethical.  It is a good read about a family who suffers endless tragedy and wonders why they don't see some of the profit and/or even understand all that their mother unknowingly gave to benefit the medical community.

B00007BKVC|3.0|\\"Thelma and Louise\\" is somewhat entertaining, but drags in too many places.  It is a story about a waitress, Louise (Susan Sarandon), and a picked-on housewife, Thelma (Geena Davis).  They want to have a fun week-end, a girl's time for fun and relaxation at a friend's cabin.  They can stay there for the week-end for free and that is as wild as they usually get.  Somehow they become outlaws and ride through the West, robbing convenience stores and raising all kinds of dust with male Chauvinist pigs.  Thelma and Louise enjoy the excitement too much and decide not to give up the fun.<br /><br />The movie could have been an hour shorter and a lot more interesting.  The movie has some great scenic locations as they travel through the West.

B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|The bottom line: this set of all the symphonies recorded by Leonard Bernstein from his days on the old Columbia/CBS label is a wonderful bargain if you don't already have a lot of early Bernstein. If you already have the lion's share of these recordings, the set may not be worthwhile.<br /><br />Which is a shame, because it really is gorgeous. I admit the size is awkward -- it was a strange choice to design the box to fit in a stack of LP records rather than CDs. But the level of care and detail is welcome, and a far cry from EMI's recent spate of no-frills but comprehensive collections of music by such figures as Herbert von Karajan ([[ASIN:B000ZBPQEO orchestral]] or [[ASIN:B000ZBPQEE operatic]]), [[ASIN:B000TIO4Z0 Maria Callas]], or [[ASIN:B001PKVFFI Yehudi Menuhin]]. Those sets generally have flimsy boxes (except the Menuhin), cookie-cutter CD sleeves and bare-bones liner notes.<br /><br />This Sony set, in contrast, is a terribly sturdy showpiece. It has individually designed sleeves for each CD that are replete with great photos from lots of different Bernstein periods, as well as a booklet with more beautiful photos -- even if the book is a bit light on content. The production philosophies between this and the EMI sets are miles apart. My only real gripe is that the box contains four different plastic compartments to hold the CD sleeves, and in each compartment I found it a real pain to lift the bottom CD up and out of the box.<br /><br />But the music is the key -- and this set is a great bargain on that score, especially at the current price of under 100 dollars. Most significant is the complete early Mahler cycle, which until recently ran for about $60 just by itself (one of the main reasons I still didn't have it, cheapskate that I am). Add to that complete cycles of Beethoven, Sibelius, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Schumann and Bernstein himself, and that's a ton of value.<br /><br />Then there are, beyond the complete cycles, still a very large number of other symphonies, including hefty doses of Haydn, Shostakovich, Mendelssohn and Nielsen, plus several symphonies I have never heard by other composers. I am really looking forward to sinking my ears into some gems that are off the beaten track of standard concert repertory.<br /><br />I do think that framing the set around symphonies was a bit facile and arbitrary, and I am a little nervous that I'll end up buying these again in 2018 as part of some comprehensive collection celebrating Bernstein's 100th birthday. Sony still has plenty of music in its Bernstein catalog besides this collection of everything that had the word \\"symphony\\" in the title.<br /><br />As other reviewers have commented, this collection does not contain new remasterings, so it's probably not for those who are already sitting on fine Bernstein Columbia collections. (Although if I had most of these individual CDs, I'd seriously consider selling them on Amazon Marketplace or elsewhere, and getting this box in their place. Might even make a profit on the deal overall, and would certainly gain a lot of shelf space.)<br /><br />For people like me, with only a handful of these recordings on hand, it's a great deal and a welcome addition. Not to be missed.ses of Haydn, Shostakovich, Mendelssohn and Nielsen, plus several symphonies I have never heard by other composers.

0307454541|3.0|There's been so much written about this book -- and the whole series -- that I will skip the recap and simply sum up my thoughts.<br /><br />As the title of my review indicates, I really do not get why there is so much hype about this book.  The first half, if not more, moves downright slowly and is in no way compelling.  I slogged through it in my quest to see why this book had received so much attention.  Still, the pacing does improve, and  the plot unfolds from the muddled mess of the first half.<br /><br />The writing -- or the translation -- is pretty bad in spots.  I shook my head in disbelief at some of the sentences, the cliche-riddled phrases, etc.  I tend to think it is the translation, though it is hard to know for sure.<br /><br />The many references to the geography of Sweden baffled me.  How about a map?<br /><br />All told, I'm not likely to read the next two.  The plot is unusual, for sure, but that's not enough to make it a great book.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Despite the blu-ray packaging stating that the movie is in 1:85 widescreen aspect ratio, it isn't. My other DVD of the same movie with same \\"1:85 widescreen aspect ratio\\" rating on it IS a true widescreen. This blu-ray edition is NOT true widescreen...although it's NOT pan 'n' scan, which is always good. The screen is totally filled with the picture, but NO black bars to represent the 1:85 aspect ratio.

1599219751|2.0|If you believe what you read in this long story you will believe it was \\"written\\" by a Polish Lieutenant of Cavalry who was involved in the fighting which accompanied the division of Poland between Germany and Russia as the result of the Nazi-Russian Non Aggression pact of 1937 - was later arrested for allegedly plotting against the Russian cause, tried in Lubyanka Prison in Moscow in 1940, sentenced for 25 years hard labor in a Siberian prison camp, transported there in winter 1941, escaped and walked three thousand miles south from Siberia past Lake Baikal, out of Russia across Mongolia, across the Gobi Desert and thence through the Himalayas to India where he was freed in 1943 to join the Polish air force in 1944. And, friends, if you believe all this you will believe anything. But if you believe even some of it - and I do in the sense that if the particular event didn't happen to the author it did in fact happen to someone else of equal standing - it can be a part of a great story, the larger part of which is open to question but still a good read.     The reviewers have had a fun time with this book over the last fifty plus years (it was first published in 1956; and I first read it thirty years or so ago)) - and for good reason. First, it was not \\"written\\" by the ostensible author, but rather \\"told\\" to a journalist who wrote it up according to his own interpretation of what was said  - or should have been said - and the writing itself is pretty bad, It has all the qualities and defects of those breathless account of a two headed baby or a traveler from out of space found in the journalistic trash by the check out counter of your neighborhood supermarket. Second, the story is frequently a day to day account of what happened; and, since it was obviously impossible for the author to keep a journal over the three years spanned by the story, the events told sequentially day by day are absolute inventions. So you have the old problem: when you know some of the story is fiction, where do you find any truth? Everything is suspect.     For what it is worth, here's a quick take on this from someone who has spent a lot of years on the bench in a courtroom trying to evaluate testimony and separate fact from fiction. The facts graded here on a scale of zero to 10, zero being patently false. The arrest and trial - probably really happened but not necessarily exactly as told in the book - 7. Journey to the prison camp. Ditto - maybe a bit oversold -  6. The prison camp - good description of a typical Siberian Camp. If the camp events didn't happen to this author they sure did to a lot of others - generously give  them a factual 7. The escape: Find it difficult to believe the Commandants wife would help but someone had to give the escapees the things they needed to survive. Suspect escape an inside job, but not via Commandants wife. -  5. Journey south to south of Lake Baikal - sounds real - 8. Gobi Desert crossing - zero.  - Nobody could walk day after day in that desert heat without food or water and survive. I simply don't believe it. Furthermore 30 miles in one day in these circumstances? Impossible! And how does a walker judge 30 miles and not 20, or 10?  This being said, however, they got across the desert somehow. Must have had transport of some kind because entry beyond the desert into Kansu had ring of truth to it - 6. Rest of journey 3 to 7 depending.     So when you finish this book .You are left wondering how much truth you have read, but you know you have read a great story; and you too can engage in the game of trying to separate the facts from the obvious fiction in this book

B001F0WXY0|2.0|First off, this is a review of the Kindle edition of this book. I apologize in advance if you're considering the paper edition and this isn't helpful; Amazon doesn't give us a way to rate the Kindle version separately.    I really like the book itself, but can't recommend the Kindle edition due to sadly sloppy formatting -- in literally hundreds of places, the Kindle edition will spuriously add italics where none belong, or remove italics where they do belong, or remove spaces between words so they run together, or confuse dashes with hyphens and use quotation marks or apostrophes that point the wrong direction. There are some typos too (which I think are not literally typos, but OCR -- optical character recognition -- errors).    All of this distracts from the enjoyment of what should be an excellent read, frequently reminding you that you are reading a book published by a company that couldn't be bothered to proofread their work.    The fact that this is an extra-cost \\"40th anniversary edition\\" adds insult to injury (the Dune sequels haven't been given the 40th anniversary treatment, and aren't full of these annoying errors, and they cost less to boot).
B002VPE1XE|5.0|The AmazonBasics Universal Camera Case FF is a good basic padded nylon camera case. It is a perfect fit for my Sanyo VPC-FH1A digital camcorder; alternatively, it can house myPanasonic ZS7 digital camera along with its charger and a couple of spare batteries.  Construction and layout is pretty basic; there are no fancy pockets, just a small zippered pocket in front of the case. The pocket is small and can not house anything that would be very thick. There is no pocket on the flap.  The belt loop on the back holds with strong velcro on one side, so you won't have to undo your belt to hook it up, which is always nice. There is also a small metal ring on top of the belt loop, where you can attach a supplied wrist strap, which looks a little too fragile to my taste.  Construction and finish are very good. The design is very basic (hey, it's an Amazon Basics product, duh) but overall this is a very versatile case at a rock bottom price that can be useful to the casual photographer and videographer. The ability to store a compact camera along with its charger and accessories makes  it a great travel companion. Recommended.
B0044KBQLE|5.0|I have to say that season 6 is definitely getting better an more exciting every episode.  I'm sooo excited now that Sam got his soul back! I can't wait to see what he will be like.

B00377V6J2|5.0|First off I would like to say how proud I am to be a Canadian; to have these 2 blues legends play together in my back yard just 30 miles away from where I live back on Dec.6th 1983. I had already bought the sacd when it came out a few years back(2003).I just loved it. Now to have the DVD is just icing on the cake. To see them play and talk to each other is really something special. it's like father and son the way they look at each other and you can see the respect they both have for each other too. Albert is genuinely proud of Stevie and vise versa. They created a session of music with the help of their supporting cast that will be one for the ages; it will be hard to beat.We lost 2 of the best period. Thank you Stax for this masterpiece. My only complaint is it would have been nice to have a 5.1 surround track on the DVD. Now what would really make this PERFECT is to put this session on Bluray with a 5.1 lossless track. Maybe some day it will happen.
B0049VZ2UY|2.0|I read the Compendium (Issues #1-#48) a while back, and this show strays pretty far from it. The main actor is a horrible choice too. Most of the others that weren't made up and were in the comics are good choices though. Even though the zombies look really good, nothing else does. Planning on downloading this from Amazon? The video quality is atrocious for the \\"HD\\" version. iTunes is probably a better bet, or if you must see it, just wait for the BD to come out. I'm very disappointed in how this show turned out since Robert Kirkman had such a big roll in making it.
0316098337|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book but it didn't live up to my expectations at all. The book builds up to a climax about 100 pages into the story and up until this point the book is interesting and easy to read. The climax, however, is short, rather uninteresting and much less exciting than it should have been. After this point the book definitely goes downhill. The perspective is from a five year-old so that in itself makes the book slightly annoying to read as well. All in all, I felt like this story could have been written in a much more exciting and riveting way, and I wouldn't recommend reading it.
B00006FR47|5.0|I was raised on 80's Chicago and Cetera's solo stuff, then I hit adolescence and placed the band in that \\"Cheesy 80's\\" category like so many others have done . . . so imagine my surprise when I learned that Chicago used to completely rock.  I've been deep in a Chicago craze for the last month, buying what I can find of their pre-1985 material when I find it (it's all so cheap!).  So far I've purchased and fully digested CTA, Chicago (II), Chicago III, and Chicago V.  I have purchased and have yet to really digest VII, X, and 17 (though I know most of that album anyway).    I haven't heard an album I haven't loved yet, but Chicago V is actually my favorite so far.  The opener \\"A Hit by Verese\\" is my favorite song on it.  It has this groove built on dissonant piano chords that unsettles me just enough to keep me paying attention, and the 6/8 rhythm is just awesome.  The other songs I love include \\"Now That You've Gone,\\" both of the \\"Dialogues,\\" and \\"State of the Union.\\"  The bonus track on the copy I have includes \\"Mississippi Delta Blues,\\" which is incredible.  The horns are both soothing and jumpy, the drums never stop and are amazing, the keys are sweet and complex, the bass is, well, groovy, and Kath's guitar is off the charts.  I have to be careful to not over-listen to this album because I don't want to be sick of it . . . if that's even possible.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Glad I bought this cable for my D90 camera.  I also have the wireless remote but need to be in front of the camera to activate, not so with the cable.  Took pictures of my grandson and stood off to the side getting baby to laugh, then took the picture with the cable.  Great addition to my photography.
0312945973|4.0|I bought this book for my son who likes to read adventure series of historical fiction.  He is particularly interested in Egyptology, so this sounded good.  I actually bought it because of the reviews.    I wasn't planning to read it, but when it arrived, it looked interesting, so I did. I don't know enough about Egyptian history to comment on the accuracy as other reviewers have, but I liked the book.  The characters were well drawn and held my interest.  I thought the story was very entertaining and I will probably read more of this series.  If my son likes it as much as I did, I will get more of this series and we will both read them.
0800177363|5.0|Robin Williams plays a serious, yet endearing role in this story based on actual events.  He is an extremely introverted research physician who specializes in neuroscience that has spent his career trying to extact myelin (a material associated with nerves) from earthworms rather than treating patients.  Williams' character prefers interacting with plants over people.  When that job fizzles he finds himself applying for a research position at a hospital for the chronically mentally disabled.  He is shocked to learn that he will actually be interacting with human patients, and out of desperation accepts the job.<br /><br />Williams bucks the system by proposing an unorthodox treatment when he discovers that his seemingly catatonic patients are conscious and aware.  Then amazing things start to happen.<br /><br />This is an outstanding character-driven story.  If you are like me, you will become enthralled as the treatments are given and results start to manifest themselves.  Williams' first success is with a patient played by Robert De Niro.  Their blossoming friendship also helps Williams' character to awaken in its own way.<br /><br />Extremely strong performances come from everyone on the cast.<br /><br />This is a worthy 5-star offering!

B001PA0FFO|4.0|This film is so powerful because it is based on a very powerful dialogue. There isn't much going on in the movie.

B00000JMOF|3.0|Watching this movie made me realize that Young Frankenstein isn't really that far off the original movie.  Of course, there are some great bits in the movie.  The ending is incredibly powerful and the horror of the monster's death in the mill is nothing compared to that of the final shot of the family of Frankenstein (the monster's creator) acting as if nothing at all had happened.<br /><br />And yet... There are so many things that don't really make sense.  Why does the doctor switch of all a sudden from being against what Frankenstein was doing to being his sidekick?  Was it because Fritz (think Igor) died and the sidekick position was open?  Elizabeth, too, is an incredibly flat character. Then Frankenstein himself kind of switches in the middle and is like, eh enough of that monster stuff. I can see that stylistically this is a very important film that brought German Expressionism to the horror genre and in many ways established the look of horror.  But it's hard to take it seriously all the same.
B002ZCJBFQ|5.0|This is an amazing piece of history right here. If you don't know why, do some research on it. I am in love with this band and this album. There are some awesome black and white posters included with the vinyl as well. Scoop this up because none were ever produced in America and they are incredibly hard to find at reasonable prices.
0061743526|4.0|I have been making a point to read some of the 'Top 100 Books' over the years. Some of these books have been a little disappointing. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of those books that lives up to all the credit it is given.    Harper Lee takes us to the South of the 1930's through the eyes of Scout. Scout is the youngest child of Atticus Finch who is a lawyer in the small town. We see the poor conditions is this small town. The poor children who go to school with Scout and her brother Jem. We see the segregation and hate towards the African Americans.    We see a small town gripped in the prejudices of the age. An African American man is accused of raping a poor white girl and the linch mobs form up. Scout is able to diffuse a conflict and made smarter minds prevail through her innocent outlook.    This books is wonderful and while the times described seem so long ago, unfortunately the message still rings clear and is timely.
B004BSAEQC|5.0|I'm not about to write a novel for this review, so I'll just say this:  1.  No, this album isn't in the same 'style' as her features usually are.  Not gonna lie, that's what I was expecting and when I previewed the songs I almost didn't download the album because I didn't hear what I thought I was gonna hear.  2.  If you give the album a chance you'll probably love it.  Let's not keep Nicki in one box; I like the range that I see in the album...and it DOES go hard, just not in the typical rap album way.    This album is ALL I'm listening to right now; I'd highly recommend it :)
0545265355|5.0|I could not put the first book down - literally.  I took it to meals, took it in the car (as a passenger), took it everywhere.  Finished it in less than 24 hours.  You will be hooked from the very start.  And then you will need to move on to Book 2 and Book 3.  It is months after I finished the trilogy and I am still thinking about the characters.  It might be time for me to start re-reading.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|I'm not an aspiring music critic like some of the folks here seem to be, so this won't be very technical.  What I can say though, is I LOVE albums that are great all the way through, and this is one of those.  I don't understand why so many artists think its OK to release albums with one or two hits, and the rest cr*p, but that seems to be the case more often then not.  I listen to Sigh No More and enjoy every track.  This is definitely a worth while pickup for the normal cost of an album, and for 5 bucks its a no brainer.  Can't wait for these guys to release another album.
B0041KKYDS|3.0|Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire back in 2008 swept the Oscars by winning a good amount of the awards..was Slumdog Millionaire worthy of all its praise and wins..no not even close.Slumdog Millionaire is an average film at best but Danny Boyle's 127 Hours is a much better film then his previous efforts..by now mostly everyone should know about the true events that this film is based on..so there is no need for me to go into great detail about that.127 Hours is an interesting film about the strong will of the human mind and soul..about how much one man will do to survive..The film sports beautiful scenery and quick editing that is quite effective in the narrative of the story..James Franco gives a strong performance as the frantic hero..127 hours didn't blow me away by any means..its a solid film that is quite good but its not extraordinary..it didn't captivate me like Inception and Deathly Hallows did.James Franco will most likely get an oscar nomination for his performance in 127 Hours..personally I haven't seen a performance from an actor/actress this year that I believe is Oscar material but never the less he will be nominated..if anything else 127 Hours is better then the majority of the mind numbing nonsense that is currently being released in American theaters..so that's worth something in itself I suppose.
B000JLSM00|4.0|\\"The Searchers\\" is probably the most admired western by John Ford<br />with John Wayne.<br /><br />I have viewed the films numerous times over the years and have collected<br />the film in VHS & several versions of DVDs as the technology advanced.<br />Due to various quality of the film in DVD forms, I have reservations on how<br />great this film is until I viewed this Blue-Ray disc.<br /><br />Wow, such magnificent rocks, canyons and plains; such blue skies, white<br />clouds and yellow sand dunes of the various locations including Monument Valley.<br /><br />For the first time, I can see clearly the night scenes, the emotion-filled eyes<br />of John Wayne (agreed, this is his best performance in film).<br /><br />Ford and his cinematographer Winton Hoch lighted each scene carefully<br />with shadows, colors and textures.<br /><br />In this Blue-Ray format, many scenes have the quality of a painting.<br />If you pay attention, you'll find the costume design and production design<br />were carefully co-ordinated.<br />For example the scene when Wayne walked into a Mexican bar, his royal blue<br />shirt matched the blue bottles behind the bar.<br /><br />This film has a strong story with message, fine characterizations of a large<br />cast, many finely orchestrated action sequences and comedy.<br /><br />It is the last part that I found the film a bit over played, especially towards the end.<br /><br />The light-heartedness diminished the strength of this complex western.<br /><br />I understand the motives of Ford inserting humor in his films.<br />It is because he loved the people in his films and the actors who played them.<br /><br />However, personally I prefer straight-laced westerns like Ford's \\"The Man Who Shot the<br />Liberty Valance\\" which I think is Ford's best western, with Wayne.

0307272702|5.0|Taubes is a real pioneer in this age where the authorities are recommending grains and carbs as the foundation of our healthy diet, and fat is cast out as the evil stuff that makes us get, well, fat. After reading about Robb Wolf's The Paleo Solution on Tim Ferriss' blog a few months back, I immediately changed the way I was eating to fit that diet, which is essentially - no sugar, no grains, no dairy. I've never felt better in my life. Taubes' work was recommended to me by other people on the paleo diet as a way of understanding the subject in a deeper way.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed. Taubes discusses scientific evidence going way back and comes to a different conclusion than the calories-in, calories-out set likes to espouse. He discusses what exactly it is about grains and carbs that activate our fat-storing capabilities and keep us from feeling as healthy and fit as we could otherwise be.<br /><br />While his recommendations based on the analysis are incomplete (in my view), they only take up a chapter and provide an excellent starting point for anyone wishing to examine a grain-free way of eating. I did disagree with his inclusion of dairy, and I wished he'd discussed the importance of pasture-raised meats in sustaining a good omega-3 to 6 ratio. I would have used the carbs saved from excluding dairy to encourage more vegetable consumption (he has proteins in the \\"eat all you want\\" category, but veggies are rationed out, which I found very odd since there are many non-starchy veggies that are great for eating as desired).<br /><br />I think this is an excellent book for anyone wanting to better understand the nutritional evidence and science behind a grain-free diet. Once you've finished, I'd suggest The Paleo Solution by Robb Wolf as the actual \\"how-to\\" guide for following through with this style of eating as a lifestyle. Also, Mark Sisson's The Primal Blueprint Cookbook is invaluable for this style of diet. While Sisson does include dairy, I just substituted coconut milk for it and the recipes worked fine.t and the recipes worked fine.
B0045ZAQSM|4.0|I must admit I'm not familiar with this director's previous works and didn't know what to expect here. I saw the trailer and it looked good so I thought I'd give it a go. Glad I did.    Zinos owns a joint. They serve basic, burger level food, as well as alcohol, to the middle of the middle of society. It's all nondescript. His gal is leaving him for a big promotion in Shanghai. His brother, a daytime parolee from prison wants a job in name only so he can continue his nefarious ways. The guy who rents the back of the industrial building they're in, to finish his boat, never pays his rent. His friend who's in a rock band needs the restaurant as a practice space. The local health department wants to shut him down. The tax collectors are after him for back taxes and a real estate developer wants to buy the building. Oh yeah. He's also thrown his back out.    Things aren't going well for Zinos. He's being pulled in a lot of directions and a lot of bad things are happening to him. But he is what he is, and because of this the stars finally line up and a lot of good things begin to happen. Many disparate circumstances converge and things take a turn for the better. Way better.    This is a good-hearted movie. You love the characters. They're a goofy lot with good souls. And when things turn good you couldn't be happier for them. What really works here is the unexpectedness of it all. Were this made in Hollywood you could write it yourself and set your watch to it. But little that happens here is on any map you've traveled. So many great and wonderful things happen here it becomes a simple pleasure to watch. But, even as the really good things happen here, the really bad things continue to happen, so the viewer is never really certain how all this will turn out.    Zinos is a great character. He's a Greek in Germany and that alone puts a cock-eyed edge on things. His brother, who is a ne're-do-well on the outside, steps up and becomes a more complex character as things moveon. Lucia, though not the main focus, still sticks with you as a memorable character. Her developing romance with Zinos' brother is interesting. The production values, though not extravagant, are good enough to make you forget you're watching a movie. One of my only gripes here is that I wish they'd have come up with enough trump to afford some genuine American soul recordings instead of the weak covers.    This is a weird and wonderful movie. It's a joy to watch. Some of the scenes might be a bit too comic but it's a minor quibble compared to the overall greatness of the movie. If you like leaving the beaten path this is a great journey.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|This movie is great with the addition of \\"new cast members\\" especially Jessie!  The humor is fun for both kids and adults and there are some good tunes as well.  Some of the story reminded me of the Velveteen Rabbit ... the concept of kids and their \\"love\\" for their toys.  Watch to see what I mean.  I rank this high among the Pixar films that I love the most.
B002SQKQHQ|5.0|I loved this book.  One of, if not the, greatest escape story ever.  If you want to be amazed and inspired, BUY THIS BOOK!  You will not regret it!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I purchased the box from switzerland and the delivery was quicker than expected.  Of course the music is great and known but the box is really worth buying. Many photographs in the booklets and interesting stories to the productions of the albums but no lyrics.  I would buy it again!
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing this movie.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen.  There are few easter eggs that you may or may not catch depending on if you've seen the original!  I highly recommend watching the original TRON first.  There will be parts where you will be left confused if you haven't.      Tron: Legacy did an amazing job keeping my attention.  The cast that they had was amazing.  I have never seen a better cast in anything.  Jeff Bridges and Garrett Hedlund really were father and son.  Olivia Wilde as Quorra was perfect!  Micheal Sheen as David Bowie/Castor was amazing!  He did a great job as Castor!  Some people may complain about the director or the script but they were great.      This isn't your typical Disney movie.  It's action packed and it isn't as complicated as you might think.  It does have a lot of computer lingo but it is that day and age now.  The soundtrack was amazing.  The effects were amazing.  And it was perfectly set up for Tron 3!  Tron:  Legacy is worth as many watches as you have time for!
B003INBNXO|1.0|I had high hopes for IP Man. It quickly becomes evident that it is a cookie cutter, martial arts movie. The characters are one dimensional and there is little to no character development in the film. The setting is potentially interesting and then becomes a weak nationalist cartoon.     The main character is, apparently, the best fighter who ever lived. IP Man has no real problems with any of his fights. I found myself wondering if IP Man would be challenged in some way and was sadly disappointed.     If you like movies, do not bother watching this movie.
B002ZG981E|5.0|The package was delivered super quick and not disappointed with the product. So much cheaper than buying at the store. This movie is my favorite movie of all time. Brilliant acting, directing, script, the works!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Since her stunning appearance, Boyle is one of my best singers. Her first album,I Dreamed A Dream, is one of those soon to be classic you will want in your repertoire. Excellent song's choice, great audio. This is truly an inspirational CD, not only because is Susan Boyle, but she sings to bring hope. Each song comes with its lyric which make it easier to learn them, (in particular for me because English is not my first language)So, if you are looking for a gift or a CD that makes you feel relax and in peace, probably this is your best choice so far. I highly recommended it!!!
B0040JHXTI|5.0|Springsteen and the E Street Band have always been a band with power & polish... back then they were all that but they were hungry too.
B000050XEI|5.0|This is my favorite Enya CD with Watermark being a very close second.  Rarely do I find an album where I enjoy every track and actually listen to the entire CD from start to finish.  This is one of those rare ones.  As some others have pointed out, there are some musical themes here that seem repetitious of previous works.  While it would be nice if every musician could come up with something totally unique with every song they compose, it just doesn't happen.  If you analyze any artist who has produced more than 30 songs you will find some repetition somewhere.  It is almost impossible to not repeat things that are just so good, musically, and these often become part of the artist's \\"signature\\".  So instead of nit picking such details, I just enjoy these parts as old familiar friends that I enjoyed before and enjoy each time they come around. I highly recommend this album to anyone who has enjoyed any of Enya's other works.  She is really a complete master of the subject.
B004BEMC6G|1.0|Extremely violent.  Lots of senseless death.  Disturbing scenes.  Bought it via Video on Demand and ended up deleting it.
B004G6009K|5.0|Going into this movie, I was not overly excited.  I got the impression from the marketing that it was in the vein of \\"Shrek,\\" with adult-based humor.  I am so glad I was  mistaken.  This is a GREAT movie!  I think it is my favorite princess movie yet--right next to \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\"  The horse and the chameleon characters are wonderful--their facial expressions are hilarious.  And I love seeing a strong princess who is not dependent upon her savior prince.  My 4 year old daughter and 6 year old son loved it.  We may even go see it again in the theater!  It really is a wonderful movie.  I don't know what Disney did wrong in the marketing, but if you have hesitated about going--DON'T!  You'll love it.
030746363X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo570J99A8SS4C]]I am so excited to get this book.  I've read a good chunk of it... I guesstimate it'll take a while before I'm finished as it HUGE.  From the bit I have seen it is fantastic and I'm don't have any reservations recommending it at this point.<br /><br />So many of the common beliefs out there are untested and grotesquely wrong.  Tim did a FANTASTIC job to dispel many of these ramped beliefs on health, fitness, and well being.  It took him 550 pages to do so though lol  Seems he's even more interested in health and fitness then lifestyle design?  I actually firmly believe and can see from his writing in the Four Hour Body that the two are synonymous.<br /><br />Throughout the book he's very firm in cutting the excess and getting to the down and dirty of physical exercise.  Doing what it takes to get in shape, meet your goals, and none of the excess bloat exercising.  This is especially important to me as I live and active lifestyle but enjoy exercise and maintaining a ridiculous physic.  I went from being a body builder to today working out a few times a week for a few minutes a piece which Tim seems to support in his book!<br /><br />At any rate, that's enough selfless promotion.  One last plug buy the book and enjoy!  :)
0385737947|4.0|I'd read blurbs saying that this was an action-packed adrenaline ride and I have to agree.  While there are definitely moments of introspection and some expository narrative, there are HUGE segments of non-stop adventure.  The reader is truly RUNNING through this book and the maze along with the characters.    Summary    The story is told in a close 3rd person following closely the adventures and interactions of young Thomas.  He wakes in a darkened elevator with no distinct memories of himself, his past, or his future.  He remembers his name and has very vague memories about things of the world (he knows what an elevator is and general concepts like that, for example) but is totally oblivious as to his current situation.   The elevator finally arrives in the Glade where he's welcomed by a group of boys no older than him (and many are younger).  He quickly learns that they all came up through the elevator in the same way with the same amnesia and that none of them really have any sense of an overall purpose for the  Glade or, the larger mystery, of the large maze surrounding the Glade from which there is apparently no exit.  The 'Gladers' have organized a routine by which they sustain life through farming and they explore the maze through the use of 'Runners'  who search each day for a way out.  After 2 years, they haven't yet found an exit.  Still confused and trying to understand things, the next morning brings another teenager in the elevator...the first girl ever to arrive at the Glade and she brings a message with her that \\"things are going to change.\\"      Characters    Thomas is the central character that we follow on the journey.  We get his thoughts and analysis along the way and we unravel the mystery along with him.  We experience a sense of amnesia along with him as we try to figure out what could be going on and why.  As various elements unravel that confront Thomas with some potentially harsh truths about himself, I found myself feeling some of the pressure on him as though the accusations were coming at me and I didn't understand why.  I guess what I'm saying is that it was pretty easy for me to relate to Thomas...not just because he's a male protagonist but also because the presentation allowed me to learn along with him and to feel very close to his confusion and his emotions.    We don't get as close to the other characters but we do learn a lot about their personalities through their interactions with Thomas and the other Gladers.  Even though the various leaders in the Glade have distinct personalities they felt largely the same to me in two main categories...those who were pro-Tom and those who were anti-Tom.  I often lost track of which Glader was speaking/acting at a certain time because apart from those two main groupings, a lot of their behaviors/dialogue/actions were very similar.  Still, many of them did do very unique things at key moments in the story which set them apart, but generally, the Gladers fit into these key groups.    The one Glader who was different was Chuck.  Chuck was the seemingly out-of-place Glader who was almost an outcast among this group of outcasts/exiles/whatever-they-were kids in the Glade.  He didn't have many (any?) friends.  His skillset was low.  Early on, Thomas was easily annoyed by Chuck, but as the book went on, Chuck became the enduring and sympathetic character.    And finally, there was Teresa, the girl who arrived and brought on the major changes.  She spends a large chunk of the book in a coma but we still get to know about her through the various snips of memories and implications that come as well as her connection with Tom.  When she starts taking part in the action, it's quickly apparent that she's strong willed and maybe a bit cocky.  I'm interested to see how she plays out in the next book as well.    My Thoughts    The idea for this plot and this world is very interesting to me.  It's a strange dystopia world where adults are absent and children are fighting for their lives and their future.    The  intriguing twist comes in the  amnesia that plagues the group.  Nobody knows why they're in the Glade/Maze, who put them there, what the world's like outside the Maze or any other key details.  Even after two years of searching and making maps, the kids haven't found an escape nor have they gotten any closer to answers.  And now, with the arrival of Thomas and Teresa, their entire existence within the Glade has changed and their forced to find answers and escape or die.    As the overall mystery is slowly revealed, it becomes more intriguing and each answer brings more questions.    My two main complaints with the unraveling of the mystery are both related to the intelligence of the kids.   1 - As smart as all these kids are and as much comparing of the maps as they made, it seems odd to me that either out of desperation or just pure luck, they hadn't yet made the discovery that Thomas and Teresa help them make.   2 - Again, with the intelligence of these kids, it was frustrating just how long the acronym (WICKED) remained a mystery...even once Thomas started asking the question, it still told half or two-thirds of the book before he made the connection.    So, although the kids are very intelligent, so much so that their conversation and thoughts seemed very mature at times (don't worry, there's still enough balance of immaturity to realize they are just kids/teenagers), it seems that there were a couple of things that these smarty-pants should've figured out sooner.    Overall    This was a very engaging story.  Even though the mystery is thoughtful and intriguing, it's not so deep as to overwhelm the tween/teen reader.    The story is very action packed and should appeal to an action-hungry reader.  However, if you're looking for a deep book large amounts of character and plot development...a sort of literary classic...this isn't the book for you.    The book is part of a series with the second book already released.While this main segment is self-contained as a single story, it still definitely leaves you not only wanting more, but needing to discover what happens next.  I'm not sure if the hardcover came with the \\"WICKED files\\" or not, but the version I did had various office memos/emails/etc at the end of the book that shed some more light on the mystery while also creating more questions.  In addition, it had the first few pages of book two which helped whet my appetite.    I really enjoyed this book and look forward to more.  I've got a couple of brothers (who aren't huge readers even) that I'm thinking of giving this to as a gift.    I can certainly recommend this as a good adrenaline filled adventure book.    ****  4 out of 5 stars
B0039UTDFG|5.0|My entire family and I watched the on air broadcast of Life when it premiered on the Discovery Channel.  We enjoyed it immensely, while I will admit I have not viewed the David Atterburery version, Oprah's narration was nowhere near as bad as most of these reviewers describe.  They obviously have issues with her or some other agenda.    The close-ups were spectacular as to be expected and her easy to listen to voice made it just that much more enjoyable as a television program. I look forward to watching this blu-ray once it arrives and finally enjoying each episode commercial free.  I finally can clear those ten hours of space on my DVR.
B000JFRFRM|5.0|Having already read American Gods and loved it, I got the audiobook to listen to on a long road trip.  The book is as good as ever, and the narration is spectacular - literally the best audiobook narration I have ever heard.  Guidall is a genius!
B003U9TDII|5.0|Have you noticed that great movies almost always have great scores and composers? This is no exception. Hans Zimmer is in the top three movie composers of all time-and he deserves it. Once again his music captures the entire mood of the movie, and, in my opinion, enhances it. Just like he did in Gladiator and The Dark Knight. Unbelievably great.
B002ZG99A4|3.0|A simple plot that you can check your brain at the door for? An action star studded cast? Only a 72 minute movie?!? What the heck do you call that??? I call it: Great!<br /><br />In keeping with Stallone's latest [[ASIN:B0015XHP2W Rambo]] outing, The Expendables is action packed, exciting and moves along at a very fast pace. And like I said, the movie is only 72 minutes long, so when the credits are rolling you're not yawning...you're yearning for more. What a welcome relief from Hollywood's binge of 2+ hour films. And it doesn't hurt the movie's pace when at just about every turn you run into an action hero or antihero from days gone bye.<br /><br />The Expendables is a bang bang shoot 'em up flick about a bunch mercenaries that are seemingly sent to take down a South American dictator. The action is great (sometimes a bit over the top, but hey, that's what we're here for, right?) and, as fully expected, Stallone and his band of mercenary brothers deal out some major just desserts to the bad guys.<br /><br />While quite predictable and familiar at times, I was thoroughly entertained by The Expendables. It is required viewing for action movie fans. Required.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I finally saw the movie after renting it first from a Blockbuster kiosk. I have had so many people tell me how good it is and always worried about watching a movie with so much hype.     However, it fully delivers, without a question. The actors are phenomenal, the script is fresh and creative, and the visuals and action sequences are exciting, unique, and original. I was not disappointed at all. Actually, I felt like the hype still didn't live up to the enormity or greatness of the movie.    I am honestly shocked that I have seen that so many people did not like it. I don't know if it is because it feels high budget or because of the intense action sequences. But the acting is stellar and the story is original and compelling. I was under the impression that this is all that is necessary to make a good movie. This movie simply has great additional action and visuals-and added suspense.    I absolutely loved it and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed or appreciated The Matrix, The Dark Knight, or other movies similar to these.
B002ZG981E|4.0|Do you feel like I do? Was Inception a very (long) good, modern day episode of [[ASIN:B000H5U5EE The Twilight Zone]]? Was it overly hyped as a complex, thinking man's movie? Granted, you do indeed need to think more about what's happening in Inception than, say for example, [[ASIN:B002ZG99A4 The Expendables]] (the other movie I watched this week). But at least I didn't fall asleep during my first watch through of The Expendables like I did in my first attempt at Inception.<br /><br />Granted, I probably started Inception a little too late on a Friday night after a couple (okay, more than a couple) of beers, but the next night I did the same with The Expendables and stayed wide awake. And this is not because I got lost in Inception's plot. It's because I got literally tired of the actors explaining what they were doing or about to do versus just doing it. \\"It\\" mainly being entering a person's dream, then in that dream jumping to the person's simultaneous dream, then repeating this to a third dream in the person's subconscious where time moves the slowest giving the \\"jumpers\\" the most amount of time to change the host's mind about an issue without the host realizing that his change of heart was inspired by outside parties (the jumpers). Yes, that was a mouthful, and not as easy to say as, \\"The Expendables was an action star studded bang bang shoot 'em up flick about a bunch mercenaries that attempt to overthrow a South American dictator.\\"<br /><br />But was Inception really so complex that Director Christopher Nolan had to spend almost the first 90 minutes of the movie walking me / us through what was about to happen and how it would happen without missing a detail? Would I have gotten \\"it\\" without the explanations? Maybe I give myself too much credit, but I think that I would have.<br /><br />All that said, please don't get me wrong...it was a great movie...regardless of the ultimate length of the movie and the time Nolan spent explaining it along the way. I liked it. The special effects were out of this world. The visuals overlaying all of the explaining made the movie fun to watch (on my second attempt anyway), and when there was action it was tight, exciting and extremely well done.<br /><br />The cast was interesting. Leo DiCaprio is excellent as always. Ellen Page was an interesting pick; she's cute in her [[ASIN:B0014DFCMS Juno]] kinda way, but seemed a little out of place on the action front. Cillian Murphy was good and DiCaprio's \\"dream team\\" were well cast. They all made it very believable...and it would have been just as believable without all of the verbalizing they did about how and what they were doing.<br /><br />Bottom line: Inception is a really cool and unique movie. See it. But I'd make it a Netflix pick and buy it in later 2011 when the DVD will be even cheaper.were out of this world.

B0034BW9CO|4.0|Good album, but the gimmick of loving the sounds of one's own name can wear you out.  Good dance music and nice vocals.  Royce is like a latin Chris Brown.
031603438X|4.0|I've read many bio's and books about rock stars that mostly underwhelmed me. Eric Clapton's bio of narcissistic drivel is one of the best examples I can recall. I thought this book would be like the others and was pleasently surprised it was a detailed and fascinating read.    I think the difference here is the subject of the book. I'm a baby boomer who has followed The Stones from the beginning and one of the things I love about Keith is that he has not changed drastically over decades from what he has always wanted to be...a rock musician. He hasn't taken on the role of dignified elder statesman the way many of the other musicians of that period have in their dotage and his musical interests are varied and complex. Much of the book is written about technical aspects of playing and recording, including technical talk on guitars and tunings. I played guitar so I appreciated those insights. I've read reviews by people who didn't like those parts but they were not people who played music. Maybe periodicals should get people with some understanding of music to write reviews of musician bios. The technical talk set this book apart and gave it substance.    His world has changed since the early days as a poor kid from the working class but he has never forgotten where he came from and has little desire to join the gated community and white wine society he could easily enter because of his wealth. He's never drifted very far from creating music and loves collaborating with a variety of people which keeps him vital and grounded in his craft. It is a biography of a working musician, not some aging rock star rattling around in his mansion who has not played a lick in decades but will regale you with tales of past glory.    He talks in detail about the unwinding of the close friendship he once had with Mick, which has all been very public over the years. He dishes on that throwing barbs at the personality Mick became as wealth and fame changed him, but he acknowledges him asa \\"brother\\", reminding us that brothers fight, and gives him his due in song creation and his ability to hold an audience through performance. Yeah, he might not like many things about Mick the person but he does praise Mick the professional where he feels it is deserved. He says, for instance, Mick may be one of the best blues harp players alive. That's a pretty lofty compliment and when I listened to Midnight Rambler again, I see his point. So, yeah, while all the professional reviewers are drooling over the digs Keith takes at Mick, I found far more compliments than I expected and that was nice to read.    He does not pull punches on the drug use and details how long and hard a road it was for him to get and then stay clean. The fact he lived through all that is remarkable in itself and one of the things he points out is the drugs he had access to were much higher quality than what most people buy off the street. Good point, Keith. LOL. Pharmaceutical cocaine is going to be a whole lot purer than the stuff being peddled to the audience at Stones concerts. Even his heroin sources were much better quality. The bottom line is he is lucky he lived this long and can tell the tale with candor. People around him did not fare so well. Graham Parsons is a tragic example. The two of them shared a love of music and heroin. Graham's drug sources were far less pure. His influence on the music of The Stones is one of the things which made so much of their music so soulful when you combine the country with the blues. I could write an essay on this topic but those of you who understand don't need it and the rest of you would not understand at all.    One of the things I found fascinating about this book is that I never got bored by anything. I have not been a fan of The Stones' music since their golden era from '68 to about '72, but always found them interesting and entertaining for their antics. The last album I purchased was Steel Wheels which I enjoyed but rarely listen to today. In spite of that, their career course and events which follow that period were written in a way which would not allow me to put the book down and when I was finished, I wished there were more. It exceeded my expectations. Thanks for not growing up and taking me back to fun times, Keith.     It was a gas! gas! gas!
B003YOZNBU|4.0|When comics become movies, the ideas are sometimes hard to convey. Take Jonah Hex. Here we have a man touched by death that has a \\"odd way\\" about him. As he makes his way in the world and sees so many people he is close to die, he begins to wonder \\"why me\\" and becomes hardened. This leads him to doing some rather odd things that sometimes means fighting doom and sometimes means fighting the nearly dead but always means that he is at war with himself. In the comics he deals with some rather odd entanglements, fighting Lovecraftian beasties that are not ever friendly and are sometimes measured by the amount of tendrils they bring to a fight. In the movie it is more like a \\"Wild Wild West\\" film theme, with some mad butcher carving a path that allows the viewer to see what is right and what is wrong. In the comics the distinction is not so easily made.<br /><br />When I watched this movie, I knew it would be awkward to see that scarred face as it talked out the side of its burned mouth. What I did not expect was just how awkward the rest of the film would be. With the acting being done at a modest level and the requirements of the film being bigger guns and more perfection via explosion, the rest of the script was tame. I had wanted more, wishing and hoping, but the film was not what I had hoped for. It was, instead, tame and it asked viewers to want this in their film.<br /><br />There were a few interesting parts in the film, like when Jonah talked with the dead. That was interesting to see, and it was interesting to see the way they suffered. I personally liked that and I liked some of the other pieces there as well. Honestly, I liked the movie but I liked it in a B-movie kind of way. That meant that I would have given it a rounded up 4 stars BUT it was not that type of film. It was a big screen debut of a character that should have been more, could have been more, but never became what he should have been. That was sad, too, considering the promise there.<br /><br />If you want a film, then you may or may not like this. I picked ot up because I wanted to watch sometihng, not because it was my first choice, and that is how I got to my 4 star roundout. Still, if you want to say that you compare it to a normal silverscreener, it might be more in the 3 star arena. Use caution, checking into what you see beforehand.n you may or may not like this.

B0000029GA|1.0|there are about 50 better new york rap albums.  This is sadly overrated by the media and magazines.  The beats are very boring and I only enjoy one song(Memory Lane)
B002ZG980U|2.0|At the first the movie seems fresh and captivating with the idea that this movie will shed light into the human psyche, and perhaps a notion of false memories, of \\"MK\\" or even existentialism.  Instead it serves up a nice distraction full of explosions gunfights and over used footage from previous scenes.      This movie reads like the Matrix meets Flatliners, meets one of the Bond films (not important which one) and perhaps throw in a Johnny Mneumonic just for flavor enhancement. This movie has a decent start and is filled with promise and mystery but it presumes confusion=complexity and that only very intelligent people could or should follow along. I say this is just all around bad story telling/bad movie making masquerading around as intellectual complexity.  Around every corner a situation arises and the plot unfolds in an unoriginal way.  The plot is delivered through dialogue and the character Ariadne who always seems to be a step ahead is obviously indispensable as a plot thickener and character salvage for Di Caprio's role.       Besides biting off more than this movie could chew was the bad direction; it reeked of the director's predisposition to cast the same ideal \\"futuristic\\" vision of men in suites. Apparently we haven't seen enough people in suites starting taking over the future, starting with Robert Longo's obsession and trickling down to this movie.  I couldn't help but think I was watching another version of Batman (which happens to be another film this director (Chris Nolan) did). Nolan's subplot vision of characters seems to play out the same scenario; a struggle between family that puts the \\"empire\\" into question. In Batman it was Bruce Wayne and his enterprise in question, in this film yet again a similar scenario plays out; this time with Cillian Murphy (who also appeared in Batman) and his Uncle played by Tom Berenger. The musical score even seemed like a rip off of his previous film with the over use of horns and deep eerie bass. The worst of it was the unnecessarily long slow motion `nail-biter' scenes of the van going over a bridge.     This film is not a complete waste of time but it certainly wasn't the \\"genius\\" film everyone seems to think it is. It was mildly entertaining and there is enough action to keep most people attentive. I would say that if you watched it once and you were astounded and would like to stay astounded then do not watch again. This film only reveals more and more flaws in direction, screen writing, overacting and general story telling. At the end you feel like the film was held together with bubble gum and weak tape. If you expect more from films, then look elsewhere because Hollywood certainly does not have the know how.  Do yourself a favor after watching this film and watch MST3K's Overdrawn at the memory bank and then you WILL be astounded how much money was needed to be pumped into remaking another bad film.
0765350386|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic. Please keep in mind that I am NOT a person who is well versed in the sci-fi genre. However, I do believe that there is a certain amount of gratitude that needs to be expressed. The magic system is wonderful. I found myself loving many of the characters and disheartened when some lived and others died. Isn't that what a book is supposed to do? Evoke emotion? The world was very different from the normal, \\"grass field\\" or \\"snow everywhere\\" type worlds. All in all. A must read for those new and old to sci-fi. It's enjoyable, without being obnoxious.

031603438X|5.0|I've been a fan of the Rolling Stones for over 40 years now and reading Keith's book allows a new insight.  Since completing this book I've had a resurgence in listening to the old Stones tunes with a fresh perspective.  A book that can inspire me to listen and enjoy tunes that I've heard hundreds if not thousands of times and fully enjoy with focus on different sounds,meanings, etc is truly deserving of my 5 stars.    The book is not only about the Stones, but is really about Keith's \\"Life\\", the Stones play an understandably major part.  Keith describes his childhood,influences,his friends, lovers, children, etc.  It really takes the reader out of the Keith Richards caricature and provides a human being, and deconstructs the various outrageous rumors.  The presentation was full of experiences,humor, third party stories, letters, and emotion- I literally cringed at his depictions of drug use and addiction.As an added bonus for the musicians in us, there ia wealth of tips re: guitar playing and songwriting.     \\"Life\\" by Keith Richards is highly recommended.
B0047VEE0U|1.0|This set is really a rip on several levels. First off, the packaging, while it looks neat and pretty, is very poorly designed. When you open the case, odds are that your cds and dvd have fallen out of the sleeve since nothing is really holding them in, and when the set is closed, they're upside down. My dvd was flapping around inside the box and was quite scratched. The \\"Sheet Music\\" from the recording session is a photocopy with a pixelated signature on it. Also printed on basically a glossy paper, which recording session paper is not! I also received the Dementors track, so I'm sure anyone who buys this will get the same sheet music! The picture disc is cool, and of course the cds are cool too, but certainly NOT worth the money. This set should be at most a 40 dollar set! There is nothing inside it of any great value! I'll be returning mine and just ordering the regular cd.
B002G1YPH0|3.0|The cooler does very well on cooling when not using huge overclocks on CPU.  If I use more than 3.5 volts on a Intel 875k cpu, at more than 3.6 GHZ, than the cooler will not cool enough.  At 4.0 GHZ stock voltage I hit about 80 Celsius in prime in a cool room.  I like the products from Cooler Master but their service is the absolute worst.  The fan on the Heatsink vibrates badly over 1500 RPM. It shakes so badly than the heatsink could be used as a back vibrater.  If I was using a small tower I could probably find my computer moving around on the table, due to the vibration.  I wonder how the motherboard would handle all the vibration.  Not a big deal you would think, just contact Coolermaster through their RMA process, and get a new fan.  Well 10 days later the fan replacement is still pending.  I hope Coolermaster reads this. They make great products, but what good is that if they have zero product support.    This is a update: It has been more than a month, Coolermaster never returned my email.  I gave up on getting a replacement fan.  RMA still pending. I guess their customer service doesn't exist.

B000EGF0B4|2.0|kinda boring storyline, not much seems to happen. plus the eye candy was covered most of the time, few short nude scenes.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Daria speaks for itself. If you aren't a Daria fan then you probably aren't reading this. The only drawback to this series is the lack of the original music. It's not painfully obvious, but you'll miss it where you loved it best.    It's not as disappointing as it may sound and after all, Daria is the reason the show was good, not just the contemporary music.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|i still have all 4 movies on VHS tape and they play just fine. i didn't purchase the dvd's and i won't purchase this set either.  i don't need the lastest greatest version of yellow, green or purple ray.
B003Y5H4SO|3.0|Devil wasn't as bad as I expected but FAR from great. It didn't have any twists really and didn't really hold my attention but it was better than Lady in the Water and The Happening. I don't get it. Sixth Sense was brilliant then the slow decline. OVERALL I would recommend renting this film. It has a few thrills and suspense but just don't expect too much or you will be disappointed.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|The voice of a generation, the most beautiful voice in the world sings Chrsitmas songs again. How could it be wrong? Can't believe this record is already 6 years old¡ I've updated my review just to say this record grows and grows in me every passing year. I can not say if it is better or worse than his previous Christmas album, which has been a constant on my Christmas since 1994, what I can say is that Mariah Carey is a talent of those who appear once in lifetime and with this record she has done it again. only for her cover of the The First Noel is worth buying the cd.
159448385X|5.0|The story of Mariam and Laila. Two Afghan women raised in vastly different ways that find themselves living in the same household with the same abusive (to western standards) husband. We see both their histories and understand their point of view and personalities as they meet and get to watch them grow from bitter rivals, to the closest of sisters. Covering a period of Aghan history about 50 or 60 years, we see the change of regimes over and over and how life was constantly changing for the people.    I'm not even sure where to start with this one. It was amazing on so many different levels. The characters were whispering in my ear their stories as I read . The country of Afghanistan came alive on the pages. I wanted to cry and celebrate and hope with the two women every step of the way.     5/5
B0019K06WM|5.0|The first official pairing of Graham Nash and David Crosby, and 40 years later, one of the most stunning albums of its time...or any time.  Starting with Southbound Train, their voices intertwine in that magical way and you're transported.  For my money, Where Will I Be and Page 43 make one of the most powerful combinations of songs ever laid down...as if Crosby is doing his own call and response.  Immigration Man has become a staple of theirs, and CSN(Y) shows, and today, it's even more relevant than when Graham wrote it.  I go back to this album time and time again and I'm always amazed and never disappointed.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|I got this in the mail and their version of a \\"very good\\" condition dvd differs from everyone elses. This came with scratches all over it. I will not be ordering from them ever again.
B0049VZ2UY|4.0|For a long time now, most fans of the zombie genre have been dreaming of and wishing for something to raise the bar, so to speak. Now we have it. This show isn't bogged down by sci-fi mumbo jumbo, it isn't trying to beat you over the head with any political or social message - it is just presenting you with the drama of living in a world brought to its knees by the zombie apocalypse. The first six episodes had the huge task of establishing a rag tag cast of characters as well as get us acclimated to this \\"world's\\" type of zombies, so some aspects of it seemed rushed and not explored enough. The pacing suffers at times and some of the dialogue is forced or weak in some instances. But that is okay, because there is plenty of dramatic gold for almost all viewers to latch on to and focus on. This show is destined for greatness, has a good source material, and should solve all its technical issues by next season when there will be more episodes and possibly even greater production values.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|At first, I did not like this album. It took me a while to use to it, but now I love it! I do not know why people are bashing Nicki Minaj! She is a good rapper.    The Songs I Love the Most are:    I'm The Best     Roman's Revenge    Right Thru Me    Fly     Save Me *  Moment 4 Life     Dear Old Nicki    Your Love
B002ZG981E|4.0|The overall product is excellent, especially the outside sleeve...The movie is awesome, but there is no digital copy as advertised on front...there are 3 discs...the first one is the blu-ray, the second is the special features and the third is the regular DVD...I went crazy trying to find this, but with no success...I was only able to go to the warner bros. website and download it and play it through windows media player, but not with ITunes and couldn't even import it into ITunes, as I needed this for my IPod...  I have since requested a replacement and hope that it will be in there.
0553808001|2.0|The pictures are nice, but the series has now become a joke.  So it's like buying a calendar for C.H.I.P.s without the camp value.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I was skeptical about succumbing to the hype surrounding The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo but after listening to the recommendation from a friend I can say that I am glad that I did.<br /><br />The book is slow to start but soon after this becomes a page turner. You will struggle with putting this book down - as I did. Larsson makes you feel like you are right there - over the characters shoulder - when things hurt, you feel them, when there is a happy moment, you rejoice.<br /><br />This is the best book I have read in a while.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|In the early sixties, four young men arrived on the scene and proved that you can rule the world in your twenties.  Those young men were the Beatles.  We are in a new millenium, but that message is as strong as ever.  In a few short years, Mark Zuckerberg went from being a nobody to ruling the world at age 26.  However, as \\"The Social Network\\" shows, you can't reach such levels of success without making lots of enemies.<br />I have watched this movie 3 times and I can't wait to get the DVD.  Jesse Eisenberg channels Mark Zuckerberg.  Justin Timberlake transform into Satan himself in his portrayal of Sean Parker.  This movie is a masterpiece, but it does more than just inform and entertain:  if you have the slightest enterpreneural spirit in you, this movie will set it on fire.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I use to own the VHS back in the day so I decided to upgrade. I have not actually opened the DVD yet but it is a DVD so I assume it will work. If it doesn't I will return with a counter-reply. As for the movie, it is one of Disney's timeless classics. It has a little romance, some adventure, lots of singing, and a happy ending. There are some dark moments and scary parts.. so for kids that get scared easily, maybe wait to show this video or have the remote ready to fast-forward. I was kind of sad to see the Beast turn back to a prince because the movie makes the Beast such a like-able character. Overall, it is one of my favorite Disney animations.
0440422973|2.0|I enjoy many of Mr. Grisham's books. They're fun escapism. But excluding the touching ending, \\"Skipping Christmas\\" brings neighborhood peer pressure and rampant consumption to the front and center. The author takes pains in ridiculing the heaping amounts of guilt, familial bickering and work involved for people who participate in Christmas. The only ones who seem to get a \\"Get Out Of Jail Free\\" card are individuals that are not Christians. Everybody else is expected to tow the line. The Krank's neighborhood is like a Yuletide version of \\"The Stepford Wives,\\" but instead of just the women, practically everybody is an automaton. Ultimately, the book, intentionally or not, praises holiday conformity and family deception. Bah, humbug!

B0037KMHRY|5.0|I went to go see Tron: Legacy a week ago, and during the opening credits I remember thinking, Wow, this music is amazing! That night I downloaded the album off of iTunes. No matter how much you love an alum, there tends to be one or two duds on it, tracks that may not be the worst but you often skip them. This album is brilliant, not one dud on it. It can be described as techno mixed with classical. If you're going to get it, though, I recommend the iTunes version, as the actual CD itself can cause complications due to an all black back on it. Furthermore, the iTunes version contains two bonus tracks. Amazing music by Daft Punk!!!
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Bottom-Line:  In the final analysis I thoroughly enjoyed this freshly minted version of \\"Sherlock Holmes.\\"<br /><br />Some might say that the tried and true story of Sherlock Holmes should not be trifled with, that the legendary Sir Arthur Conan Doyle tale needs no refreshing from the masterful(?) storytellers in Hollywood.  But they would be wrong.  As told through the lens of director Guy Ritchie, and the acting chops of Robert Downey Jr., and Jude Law, this (new) \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" (2009) is a worthy tale indeed.<br /><br />Story-Line<br /><br />Directed by (Guy Ritchie ~ Swept Away, Revolver), \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" follow the exploits of the able detective portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Gothika), and his more than able sidekick Dr. Watson portrayed by Jude Law (Cold Mountain, Closer, Enemy At The Gates) as they corner and capture Lord Henry Blackwell (Mark Strong ~ Body of Lies, Robin Hood, Babylon A.D.) who is murdering young women in pursuit of him black magic.<br /><br />After his capture the Lord is sentenced to hang, and hang he does and is pronounced dead by Dr. Watson, only to reappear later in the story and become the nemesis Holmes chases.  But only after an old flame, one Irene Adler, portrayed by Rachel McAdams (Mean Girls, Wedding Crashers, Red Eye) reappears in Holmes life bringing with her a mission and duplicity.<br /><br />Lord Black soon reappears, is quite alive, and has hatched a plan to murder and control, and so begins the saga...<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />As directed by (Guy Ritchie ~ Swept Away, Revolver), \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" the story and the man take on a decidedly dark turn.  Gone is the dapper, proper, prim, detective we have all come to associate with Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, replaced by a profoundly intelligent if decidedly dour Holmes.  Not that I totally dislike this Holmes, if anything he is more human than the Holmes of old, more fallible, more approachable and dare I state believable, but do we want our Holmes to be so human?<br /><br />Jude Law portrays Dr. Watson to type; he is the opposite of Holmes; e.g. he is classy and very much the English gentleman Holmes is not.  In this adaptation of the classic tale Holmes is an accomplished fighter given to street fighting in order to hone his skills.  These fight scenes are very well thought out and orchestrated; the director fist plays the episode out in slow motion with Holmes plotting out every strike and its effect on his adversary.  We are then treated to the scene in real time as Holmes dispatches him hapless foe with skill and aplomb.  Loved it!<br /><br />McAdams somehow look out of place in period garb.  Perhaps it's her sharp feature and rather pallid completion that do not lend themselves to the period; whatever the reason, she was not convincing as Holmes' soft foil, his ex-lover with a grudge; she is just too young.  A more mature woman like Rachel Weis, or the always delectable Gweneth Paltrow would have been more fitting and believable.<br /><br />In the final analysis I thoroughly enjoyed this freshly minted version of \\"Sherlock Holmes.\\"  While I do wish our English hero was portrayed a little closer to type, Robert Downey Jr.'s rather eccentric portrayal is not without merit and gravitas.  Yes, I would have gone in a different direction than Ms. McAdams for the female lead, but the choice of Jude Law for Dr. Watson was spot on.to be so human?

B001HNE3NO|5.0|I read this after being referred to it.  I couldnt put it down as i went back in time.  Very well written and easy to follow story. this shows the hidden parts of history.
0375703861|1.0|I usually finnish a book by the end of the week but I find it hard to finnish this one because of its very flat charaters, the fact that you can't care or want to care about the characters, the plotline was like something out of Eastenders and also the fact that its very unrepresentative glimpse of black and Asian communities.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I've read many of the reviews. It may be true that Food, Inc is a bit one-sided, but some of the points it raises are to be considered seriously. One point that was raised is the fact that $1 menu places are more affordable than healthier food in a store; a direct contributor to the growing epidemic of childhood obesity. A lot of the argument may remain dormant unless parents can get their kids away from the video games and insist they get some exercise. Lots of other points are raised, and should be considered. I'm glad I saw this worthy (though unpleasant) film; it's a wake-up call, long overdue, and makes a lot of valid points that we cannot deny need attention. DVD extras are plentiful.
0143116371|5.0|I bought this book for a friend but when I received it, I honestly wanted to keep it for myself! My sister and I had so much fun flipping through before it was wrapped and rating outfits. I did give it to my friend and, of course, she loved it. She loves the blog and said she loved the book. Great book for the fashionista at heart.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|There's nothing monumental I can say that hasn't already been covered by so many of the great reviews here ... but I feel compelled to say something when I really like a movie! I enjoy a story that's able to draw me in to the point where I'm helpless to do anything but root for the bad guy - even though I don't condone their actions - because I've been compelled to see things from their perspective and sympathize with the circumstances that brought them to that point.     I was impressed with the balance of elements that make a film appealing to a broad audience (drama, action, romance, suspense), and look forward to seeing Ben Affleck's future work as a director.
0307276902|5.0|I'm sure it's safe to say that by now everyone knows that James Frey exaggerated the facts in this book to make it a better read.  But does that discredit the entire novel?  Maybe a little, yet not at all.  Contradictory, I know, but hear me out.   Frey really was  an addict, and he really did get treatment at a facility. This is the main point of the book- and he sheds light on a subject that most of us will never experience in a way that hits home. Who cares if the jail time is made up, who cares if maybe some of the characters are too? The feelings are real, and they make the reader really reconsider a lot of things in life.  Take it as fiction, take it as nonfiction. Do whatever makes it right in your head-- but read this book.  Take the lessons you learn from it and apply them to your life.  I personally don't care if none of these characters actually went into the treatment center with them. I will buy everyone of his books.  His writing style and insight to addiction alone make this book amazing.

0811870413|5.0|I just love this book.  If you are looking for something quick or simple table based recipes this book isn't for you.  It's not supposed to be.  The book starts with a wonderful narrative about Chad and how he and Tartine came to be.  It makes you feel like you are friends by the time he starts into the basic country loaf recipe.  The recipe is 30+ pages long and reads like a story with loads of photos.  Whilst using the combo cooker seems like a palaver it really produces unique and amazing results for the home baker.  I've been making basic yeast breads for some time...they were good yes, but never amazing.  Never something you would find in a great bakery or a restaurant.  The bread using Chad's method and recipe really is that good.  Once you get accustomed to the method it is something that most people are able to fit into their daily routines.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Lee Child writes like Johnny Cash sings, like an unstoppable freight train barreling down the tracks. As my first Child/Reacher book, I was uncertain as to what to expect. It was a pleasant surprise. All the overused accolades apply, hard to put dowm, fast action, roller-coaster ride, etc.<br /><br />I also agree thought that you have to look beyond the technical gaffes regarding firearms and police work. Don't fixate on that and you're going to enjoy the book, a lot.
B000WLQKU6|5.0|Like most everyone else, I was one of those kids in the 90's glued to the radio listening for what would be the next big thing, \\"What's Up\\" turned out to be one of those things for a hot minute. What one-hit-wonder fans of that song don't realize is that this album is an outstanding listen from start to finish. There isn't a bad song here. And this is a guy who came up listening to Nirvana, and Alice in Chains and the like. I honestly like this entire record, and you will too. Like some other reviewer said, if you don't buy it. you're missing out. This came out 18 years ago, and I've missed out on the 9 other hidden gems that are on this record. Seriously, Buy it, you won't regret it. And also check out Linda's other solo recordings. Equally outstanding.  -Phiber Optik

0486268659|5.0|A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens<br /><br /> Truth is a scourge. And like a scourge, it can leave one broken and bloody, stripped of all his or her defenses. No one knows this better than Mr. Scrooge, but I won't insult my readers by offering a summary of this well-known Christmas story (though I will chime in with my opinion that the old Disney version with Mickey Mouse and Scrooge McDuck is the best!).<br /><br /> I know of no one who dislikes this story. That being said, the book is waaay better; by leaps and bounds! All of the movies tell the core of the story, but they leave out all of the nuance--if a picture is worth a thousand words and they have an hour and a half to tell this story (which was only 124 pages of somewhat large text), they should be adding nuance, not removing it!<br /><br /> The only problem with it is that it's a book meant to appeal to everyone, including children. Therein lies the difficulty: it's somewhat like asking Beethoven to compose a jingle for an advertisement; sure, he could do it, and it would be good, but he could do so much better! And I know this is true, both because there are monstrous hints within the story (primarily when the narrator speaks), and because I've read some of his other works. But even if this is the worst that Dickens has to offer, then I would still rather read it than almost any other book written in the past 100 years.<br /><br />Memorable Quote:<br /><br /> What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips, to have questioned her, that she might have opened them, to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush, to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price; in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest license of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.<br /><br />For more reviews like this, visit my profile.she might have opened them, to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush, to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price; in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest license of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.

B0021L8V0W|3.0|REVIEW FOR BLU-RAY EDITION ONLY:<br /><br />I'll be honest when I first saw \\"Salt\\" I was a bit underwhelmed because frankly the trailer set me up for a different thriller.  Sure some (or most depending on how well you know the thriller genre)of the twists in \\"Salt\\" are clever but what makes \\"Salt\\" a step above most mediocre thrillers is how the director unfolds his story. \\"Salt\\" is a good if predictable film where some of the cliches of the genre are turned inside out. \\"Salt\\" plays as a cross between \\"No Way Out\\" (itself a remake of \\"Out of the Past\\") and the Bourne movies and, although not as good as those films, manages to be an entertaining thrill ride with plenty of action so you don't really notice some of the holes in the plot until after the movie is over.<br /><br />Image quality is exceptionally crisp without being over process. The lossless audio sounds exceptional and is immersive. We get subtitles with this as well.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW:<br /><br />Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt a CIA agent who suddenly finds herself being hunted when a rogue Soviet spy master named Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski)shows up and states that she is a Soviet spy and is there to kill the Russian President who will be attending the funeral of the Vice President of the United States. While Salt denies that she is a Soviet spy everything including the fact that she goes on the run indicates to her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schrieber) and Counter Intelligence Agent Peabody (Chiewetel Ejiofor)that she is, indeed, a Soviet spy who has been living and working undercover for most of her life. Salt claims she has gone on the run because whenever a spy's cover is blown their entire family is taken out and she's concerned that the only person in her life her husband will be assassinated.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />Directed by veteran thriller director Phillip Noyce (\\"Clear and Present Danger\\", \\"The Quiet American\\", \\"Rabbit Proof Fence\\") and written by Kurt Wimmer (\\"Law Abiding Citizen\\", \\"Street Kings\\")\\"Salt\\" plays with the expectations of the thriller genre with both Noyce and Wimmer knowing use the twists and turns of other films. What really sells \\"Salt\\" though are the performances and the stunts in the film as well as the ingenious flashback story that is integrated into the main film revealing almost everything about Salt well before the midway point of the movie. While these attributes don't save the movie entirely, it does make the film diverting and entertaining.<br /><br />There are some gaps in logic/the narrative but these are pretty easy to over look because you end up if you become involved in the movie. The ending which sets up a sequel wasn't quite as conclusive as it should have been as they could easily have left it open on the theatrical version but given us a bit more closure for the audience. Most films that leave an opening this large just don't work and it is a major Achille's heel for \\"Salt\\".<br /><br />You can watch the \\"Director's Cut\\" an \\"Unedited Version\\" or the theatrical cut of the film with the Blu-ray. You should note that the story unfolds and is resolved in a slightly different fashion with the \\"Director's Cut\\" rather than the theatrical cut. As to which one you enjoy most, it'll, again, depend on your expectations of the movie but most of the changes are fairly cosmetic (i.e., don't add or subtract from the overall impact of the film).<br /><br />There's also featurettes on the production of the movie as well as Noyce providing a commentary track that is quite interesting particularly when it comes to the decisions for the editing decisions made for the film.<br /><br />If you set your expectations aisde set up from the preview trailer, \\"Salt\\" is an enjoyable action flick (of course it has little to do with reality but when was the last time you saw an action flick that DID have something to do with reality) and you might want to give it a chance to \\"prove\\" it's case.expectations of the thriller genre with both Noyce and Wimmer knowing use the twists and turns of other films.

B002ZG980U|3.0|I know there has been a lot of praise for this movie, and I came in to it hoping to be entertained, but, honestly, I felt it was just \\"so-so.\\"  Forgetting the special effects, one has to look at the stars, the script, and direction.  Now I am different than many here, since I am in my fifties, but I do like a number of recent films, and I have seen thousands of movies in my day, covering all parts of film history, so I have plenty of remembance of films past to draw upon in comparison.  However, \\"Inception\\", along with \\"Shutter Island\\", are two examples of recent films I just don't care enough about the people portrayed, or the stars' lacking of chemistry with the audience, and both stories left me desiring more in the way of substance over flash.  (Shutter Island, I was so far ahead of the ending that it left no surprises.)  I know the special effects in Inception are remarkable...but so what?  Where's the heart?  DiCaprio's story was supposed to deliver it, but I couldn't feel anything for him or his situation.  Too much explanation, not enough love.  As a side note, I'd really like for the actor to take some time off from the serious films he has been making.  He's just so damn intense in his performance that his own personality fails to cross the screen to the audience.  His characters of later have all been so self-involved that the actor rolls himself into a ball of deep intensity...and it doesn't leave his body to get to the audience.  That intense furrow across his brow and steely eyes just doesn't do it for me.  I miss the jocular Leonardo from Titanic.
B003V1WUKS|3.0|I found this a bit disappointing, but mostly because I was expecting something either incredibly terrible or something completely brilliant, and this fell in the middle. I guess that's how things roll with James Franco - he never does what I expect. Ever.<br /><br />This would've made a better screenplay, though. In a visual medium, it would've been slightly surreal, ala Sofia Coppola. But in the written word, something doesn't quite jive. Overall, though, it wasn't bad. A couple stories were pretty good.
B00192IV9U|1.0|Don't get me wrong - there are seven good GENUINE songs on this album.... but the reason for my low rating is that Michael's greedy estate have chosen to include three songs which sound very suspect. They sound like a Michael Jackson impersonator. Where is the estates proof that Michael Jackson is the person singing on the Cascio songs?? They claim that they hired forensic musicologists to verify that they are infact Michael's vocals. If they were so unsure about this shady trio of songs that they felt the need to hire forensic musicologists then there is clearly something fundamentally suspect about them. They didn't go to such drastic measure to prove that it's Michael on the other seven songs... and that's because Michael has one of the most unique and easily-recognisable voices in pop. Even on an off day, Michael Jackson still sounded like Michael Jackson. If you even have to question it for a second, it's obviously not him. I didn't have to question the authenticity of Best of Joy or Much Too Soon or Hollywood Tonight. I knew from the first second that these songs were genuine because nobody can sing like that except Michael Jackson.    If you want to buy this album just download the seven genuine tracks. If you care at all about Michael's aristic legacy do not support Breaking News, Monster or Keep Your Head Up. I know how absurd it sounds but this is not just some crazy fan conspiracy theory. Sony Music are a giant corporation and they know they are untouchable. This is why they've gone ahead and released three fake songs on a Michael Jackson album. Nobody stands a chance fighting against such a big corporation.     At the end of the day, there wouldn't be such a big controversy over these vocals if they were genuine.
B0041T52S6|5.0|A film that takes the teen action comedy to a new level but those who have not experienced the graphic novels of Scott Pilgrim nor arcade/video games are likely to be confused about some parts of the movie.  In some ways it's like a musical but instead of breaking into song it breaks into Matrix style Boss Battles that are more clever than high octane fueled.  Regardless, the asides and remarks are truly colorful and vibrant.  Pilgrim chose the wrong girl but I'll let you decide when you see the ending.  After reviewing this movie I just might rent it again or maybe even buy it.  DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOT POINTS: B to B plus; INNOVATION: A plus; WHEN WATCHED: December 2010; MY GRADE: B plus to A minus.

B002WY65VU|5.0|\\"Without other people, you might as well be a zombie\\".  A great line from a great film.  This zany twist on the recent zombie-mania trend is a must.  It has just enough humor and gore to satisfy all tastes (if you get my drift).  Woody Harrelson (of Natural Born Killers fame), Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are priceless...per fectly cast in this offbeat ditty. The gore, effects, makeup, sound, settings and script are superb.  And, I loved the scene with Bill Murray (playing himself).  The last portion of the film takes place at \\"Pacific Playland\\", which is actually Georgia's Wild Adventure and Water Park (gotta go there sometime).  Zombie fans definitely won't be disappointed...and sometimes it's nice to chuckle a bit, even when you're being munched on.  5 STARS!

0385528752|5.0|Switch is a compelling, story-driven narrative the Heaths use to bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology, sociology, and other fields to shed new light on how we can engage our emotions and reason to create real change.<br /><br />The book is arranged around an analogy that illustrates the crux of emotional intelligence: when making a decision we are typically torn between our rational, logical reasons and our emotional, intuitive feelings. Chip and Dan ask us to imagine an Elephant and its Rider (the mahout). The Rider represents the rational and logical. Tell the Rider what to do, provide a good argument and the Rider will do it. The Elephant, on the other hand, represents our emotions, our gut response. If the Rider can direct the Elephant down a well-prepared path then there is a good chance for change. Otherwise, the massive elephant is bound to win.<br /><br />The book is structured into three sections, each one suggesting specific behaviors you can follow:<br /><br />I. Direct the Rider:<br />- Find the bright spots<br />- Script the critical moves<br />- Point to the destination<br /><br />II. Motivate the Elephant:<br />- Find the feeling<br />- Shrink the Change;<br />- Grow your people<br /><br />III. Shape the Path:<br />- Tweak the environment<br />- Build habits<br />- Rally the herd<br /><br />Another must read on the topic is [[ASIN:0974320625 Emotional Intelligence 2.0]]

B002WY65W4|4.0|This movie is pretty awesome the first time you watch but admittedly less attractive/exciting on repeat viewings. If you havent seen it, and like zombie movies and/or comedies, get it, its definitely worth watching.    I thought Shaun of the Dead was funnier, but this film is definitely more bad@$s    a big criticism i have is that zombies are not the central problem in the film, its the interaction between the lead characters that takes the front seat. the zombies are just kinda there for comedic support and action scenes.

B003YK42LQ|2.0|This dreary and generally aimless album is a very poor follow-up to the Kings of Leon's previous album, which was agreeable and quite pleasant most of the time.<br /><br />What we have here on this new album is a potpourri of Kings of Leon clich&eacute;s and it sounds like they made a vaguely generic \\"Kings of Leon\\" album packed with apparently purposeless and unmemorable songs. I've heard the album countless times now and I still can't remember any of the songs. The sound? Dinosaur guitar-based Rock from the 1970s - it reminds us of why the Punk revolution needed to happen!

B003VWU2WA|4.0|I bought this for my Mac as a \\"jog dial\\" to make editing in iMovie a little easier. It arrived earlier than expected! It's a little bit smaller than I had imagined, but I didn't look at any dimensions beforehand. I was a little disappointed that the PowerMate app has to be running in order for it to work. It would be nice if it ran as an extension instead of an app, but maybe that will come in the future.
B004DK5CW4|2.0|I was unimpressed with this movie.  The title character was more of a prop for the  Penny Tweedy character. Penny Tweedy was Disneyized into something she was not; the reality is she was a woman of wealth who grew up in the horse industry, not a \\"simple housewife\\" who had a special bond with Secretariat.  At the end of the movie, a beautiful black and white portrait of Eddie Sweat with Secretariat was shown.  Theirs was the true story; Eddie's bond  with this amazing animal was of the heart. A film honoring the Secretariat/Eddie story would have been powerful and inspirational, two things that this movie was not.
078401213X|1.0|This has to be the absolute worst movie I have ever had the mispleasure of watching.  The characters were not appealing, the filming was washed out, and the story was predictable.    I sugguest you steer far away from this horrid example of what people claim is a good film.  Rent \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" instead if you want this type of genre.
B000FC11A6|4.0|This was a very strange historical fiction book. It's extremely long, and the author tends to go off on tangents, but I loved the historical aspects of it, and the writing could be phenomenal at times. Although somewhat dry and occasionally a chore to read, I would still totally recommend this book for its unique perspective, and some of the interesting history regarding World War II.
B000H7JD4A|2.0|No matter how good the tracks(and there's only two good ones on this release), you are simply not going to enjoy it with this poor production. Sounds like it's playing in the next room with the door closed! I'm astonished that Nicko would permit his drumming to sound so flat. The guitars are pushed to the background. Bruce's mid B pitch is grating on the ear. Compare to how good he and the band sound on Brave New World and Dance Of Death. I bought this on CD, so it must be unbearable as a download(in case you don't know, downloaded music loses a significant amount of resolution).
B00021HBGS|5.0|My two and a half year old went through a stage where he didn't want to take a bath. He was bored with his old bath toys and needed something new to help him enjoy bath time again. Boy did this do the trick! Now I have the opposite problem-getting him OUT of the tub! He would stay there playing with these little bath vehicles until he shriveled like a raisin if I let him. The road pieces interlock like a puzzle, so he gets a good soak while he puts them all together. I highly recommend this bath toy. The pieces are sturdy and they store neat and clean in their own bag. Best of all, my son is neat and clean as a result of this toy!
B0000BYM3K|4.0|We are lucky Bruce returned to make two more FINE albums: Brave New World and Dance of Death. His vocals and the band sound top notch on these two. BE WARNED, don't waste your time or money on Matter of Life OR Final Frontier. Bruce can't hit a high note,the drums sound terrible and the production is piss poor.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|i think this movie was great because of all the action in the movie and the shooting was the beast part
0757302661|1.0|The one thing that this book doesn't tell you is that LABOR HURTS.      I would have rather been told the truth about child-birth than to go into it thinking I was Super-Woman and could do it without any pain.  I practiced and practiced, listened to the CD over and over, took the class, and when it came time, it all went out the window.  Then I felt totally unprepared for birth because nothing was going as the book told me it would and I was left helpless and confused.  I should have read other books that were more realistic and actually gave me real methods on how to deal with labor.  Stupid-me for thinking that this was the end-all, be-all method for birthing my baby.
B000H6SXMY|3.0|I purchased this boxed set because it was a great deal on Amazon, but several of the episode have a \\"grainy\\" picture quality and one episode has a poor sound-quality.  If you like the show, this boxed set is the best deal in owning the entire series.

B003DKJ5ZU|3.0|Another pleasant movie from Disney. The animation was great; the voice work was great; the story seemed kind of weak (to me). I imagine for the target audience it would be good. This was geared toward young girls, so make sure your kids are around the right age group. Also, it helps a lot if your kids are into fairies, otherwise this might not be the greatest video for some viewers.
B004AYCWY4|2.0|(revised 12/30/2010)    When describing the observable world, Dawkins is enlightening and informative. He cavorts through many disciplines: biology, radiometric dating, computer simulation, paleobiology, embryology, cladistics and geology.     When describing evolution, however, he is too enamored of his subject to anticipate common objections, and build a step-by-step (evolutionary?) path from skepticism to belief.  He uses fallacies and misrepresentations, and ignores contrary evidence, so I find his work unconvincing.     Now for the details.     The first big gap in his logic is the assumption of Naturalism.  With that assumption, only material causes are allowed, and since evolution is the only game in town that satisfies Naturalism, evolution is true by default.  But he ignores the fact that those he is trying to reach (evolution-deniers) do not make that assumption.      A second large gap is a plausible microbiological mechanism for adding information to the genome.  He give multiple examples of information loss, but no examples of adding information.     He describes a high standard for the proof of scientific theories.  \\"...the  best that scientists can do is fail to disprove things while pointing to how hard they tried. ... The more energetically and thoroughly you try to disprove a theory, if it survives the assault, the more closely it approaches what common sense happily calls a fact\\" (p.10)        Given that, one might expect this book to contain an energetic and thorough attempt to disprove the theory of evolution, but no, he sets a much lower standard - hand-picked favorable evidence:  \\"This book is my personal summary of the evidence that the 'theory' of evolution is actually a fact\\" (preface xiii).  Yet he believes his summary is sufficient that \\"no unbiased reader will close the book doubting [evolution]\\" (p.9)     Dawkins claims two groups in his target audience, those who deny evolution, and evolutionists who find themselves inadequately prepared to argue the case.(p.8) Yet his blatant scorn for the first group makes one doubt his sincerity.  By what logic does he attempt to reason with readers whom he implies are unreasonable, insane and unintelligent?  Would he consider his book a success if unreasonable, insane and unintelligent readers swelled the ranks of evolutionists?      As for explicit assumptions, Dawkins explains that this book is different from earlier books he has written, as they \\"assumed that evolution is true\\". (preface xiii)  One need not read beyond page 4 (\\"historical context - which means evolution\\") to realize he does in fact assume evolution is true.  That assumption forms the basis of his ad hominem arguments, treatment of science as unqualified truth, and circular reasoning.     Now to sample the arguments he uses.    \\"Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt...\\" (p.8)      Dawkins often conjoins several arguments, so that even if one fails, others will hit their mark.  On the face of it, this statement is a strong expression of belief, and some may be convinced through his sheer confidence. (appeal to emotion)    Secondly, his statements could be considered premises for the syllogism, \\"Sane people don't doubt facts; evolution is a fact; therefore sane people don't doubt evolution\\".  Note that \\"evolution is a fact\\" is a premise in the above syllogism, which is circular reasoning.     Thirdly, there is an implied ad hominem argument.  People who don't agree with his conclusions have doubt that Dawkins considers unreasonable, not serious, insane, uninformed, and unintelligent.  This argument is effective on people who would rather change their beliefs than suffer disapproval, however undeserved.     Dawkins praises those who accept evolution by consistently using positive adjectives when identifying them.  Not just \\"bishops\\", but \\"enlightened bishops\\" (p.7)  \\"thoughtful and rational churchmen\\", \\"senior clergy\\", \\"serious biologists\\", or \\"unbiased readers.\\"  He thus avoids falsifiable statements by creating new categories of people who are defined essentially by their belief in evolution, thus arguing that those who believe in evolution believe in evolution.  Or these could be backhanded ad hominem arguments.  If it is true that \\"serious biologists\\" accept evolution,  those who deny evolution must be \\"non-serious\\".   As a bonus, when an ad hominem argument is used against someone who would otherwise be an authority, it discredits them.  (This is the \\"poisoning-the-well\\" fallacy.)      One particularly winning fallacy is \\"...no reputable scientist disputes it\\" (evolution) (p.9)  This is the equivocation fallacy, in which \\"reputable\\" is used in two different senses.  In the scientific community, reputable\\" effectively means \\"published in mainstream scientific journals.\\"  It so happens that due to editorial bias (Naturalism) these journals do not publish articles that dispute evolution.  So, in its scientific context, this is simply an observation that scientists have to defer to editorial bias to get published.  On the street, however, \\"reputable\\" means \\"honorable\\" or \\"trustworthy\\".  Taken out of its proper context, this gives evolution false credence.  What makes this such a clever argument is that Dawkins uses the word \\"reputable\\" just once, giving no clue that it is used with two meanings.    After reviewing the psychological effect of misdirection on eyewitness testimony, he states \\"I shall never again be tempted to give eyewitness testimony an automatic preference over indirect scientific inference.\\" (p.15)   This sets up a false dilemma,  presenting \\"indirect scientific inference\\" as the more desirable of but two possible alternatives.  This steers the reader in the desired direction, avoiding alternatives such as direct observation without misdirection, inference, logical inference, or even scientific inference.    Dawkins presents a target-rich environment for the studentof logic. Using fallacies is a risky strategy, because if they are discovered, it damages the user's credibility, as fallacies must be used either knowingly or unknowingly; thus the user of them must be either deceitful or illogical.   Also, people tend to use their best arguments, so the use of fallacies suggests they lack valid arguments.    Those interested in Dawkins' use of straw man arguments may want to read Jonathan Sarfati's \\"The Greatest Hoax on Earth?\\"    In chapters 2 and 3 Dawkins spends 60 pages describing in vivid detail the effect of artificial and natural selection acting on existing alleles (which he calls genes) and harmful mutations.  In contrast, in a single sentence, he claims that \\"Gene pools ... are continually added to, for example by mutation...\\"(p.37)   Dawkins had my undivided attention here, for surely he was going to lay out the key observations, the mechanisms, the probabilities in favor of this important tenet of evolution. Instead he turns to an example of harmful mutations disabling a gene. Did I miss something here?     Luckily, in chapter 5, Dawkins again picks up the thread.  He describes Lenski's brilliant E. coli evolution experiment.  E. coli is normally able to transport citrate across its cell membrane only when oxygen is absent. One strain of bacteria evolved the ability to transport citrate in the presence of oxygen, through a series of three mutations.    Dawkins does not report that glucose transport was compromised, a fact which suggests information loss.      The researchers did not speculate whether there was a gain or loss of information, but proposed to \\"find the relevant mutations.\\"  But Dawkins reports that this experiment shows \\"new information entering the genomes\\" (p.131).  This is consistent with the predictions of evolution, however, it is not supported by the actual research results.      Also, he claims that \\"the rarity of citrate metabolism suggests that we are looking for something more like the 'irrreducible complexity' of creationist propaganda.\\" (p.128)  Now rarity is probability, which is in the domain of math.  Math is not a matter of opinion, and opinion is no substitute for math.  But instead of nailing his point with math, he substitutes creationist-bashing, and we never find out how the math worked out.   (By the way, if you were to seek the source of the \\"creationist propaganda\\" in his bibliography, you would again be disappointed.)    Dawkins claims that creationists hate \\"this triumphant tale of scientific endeavour.\\"  I don't know whats not to like about Lenski's experiment, since it shows the hard limits of evolution. What I dislike is Dawkins' misrepresentation of it.

B000E97X66|5.0|Ok I was in High School in NJ in 1975 so this is the music of my youth. That being said, this is one of the greatest live sets every recorded. Period.

B003IB38UM|5.0|Many have classified ABBA as pure disco but this is the closest they ever got to that particular music genre. Their other albums were mostly pop with maybe a few disco flavoured tunes thrown in. Whether you're a fan of disco or not, VOULEZ-VOUS is music to the ears. The songs offered are all catchy with exquisite vocals and tight intricate harmonies. Agnetha and Frida never sounded better than on this CD. The contrast between their voices is clearly evident in this album even more so than their other records.<br /><br />Frida's sultry and sexy lower register is at it's vocal best in \\"The King Has Lost His Crown\\" and \\"Lovers(Live a Little Longer)\\". Agnetha's voice is at its most stunning in \\"As Good as New\\". Her high pitched belt is energetic, and lively. Not many singers can belt out those high notes but Agnetha makes it sound easy. Her vocal work in \\"Chiquitita\\" is also outstanding. She starts off softly but really digs in to the chorus and Frida adds her trademark vocals into the harmony. One of my favourite songs on this album is the appealing \\"If it Wasn't for the Nights\\". The song itself is completely over the top in every conceivable way but it's irresistable nontheless. This song is definitely one of the albums highlights and showcases the raw talent of both female singers. Although they're both singing in unison for the most part during the verse, we still get to hear the delightful contrast of their voices. Frida's Mezzo soprano is predominant during the sections \\"Keeping me so busy/All the day through/They're the things that keep me from thinking of you\\"..etc while Agnetha impresses and is predominant during \\"Ohhh baby I miss you so/I know I'm never gonna make it....\\" and during the chorus. This song is outstanding and should have been released as a single. It may have been a little too long for radio play but that could have been easily remedied by skillful editing.<br /><br />VOULEZ-VOUS (the album) did good business internationally. It reached #4 on the Album charts here in Canada, it reached #1 in the UK and made the Top 20 in the US.<br /><br />The song \\"Summer Night City\\" was originally intended for the album but was left out. I guess they didn't think the song was good enough to be included. ABBA would make this a habit as \\"Lovelight\\" and \\"Dream World\\" were also recorded but kept off the album (and some wonderful songs would be archived including the now mythic-among-fans \\"Just Like That\\" which can be heard on YOUTUBE BTW in it's various versions). However they still released \\"Summer Night City\\" as a single in 1978 (before the album was released) and it peaked in the Top 5 (UK) and the Top 40 (Canada). It was never released as a single in the US. The singles released from the album also did well. In the UK- \\"Voulez-Vous\\", \\"Angeleyes\\", \\"Chiquitita\\", \\"Does Your Mother Know\\" and \\"I have a Dream\\" all reached the Top 5. Another single released that year, \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\\" peaked at #3- however that single was not included in the original album.<br /><br />In North America, the songs did fairly well also, \\"Does Your Mother Know\\" reached #8 in Canada and #19 in the US. \\"Chiquitita\\" reached #17 in Canada and #29 in the US. \\"Angeleyes\\" (CAN #39, US #64) & \\"Voulez-Vous\\" (CAN #42, US #80) were both minor hits.<br /><br />The bonus tracks on this album are \\"Lovelight\\", orginally a B-side to \\"Chiquitita\\" but kept off the original album. It features some great harmonies by the girls with solo passages by Agnetha. The version included on this deluxe edition differs from the versions released in previous recordings. This mix is a bit longer and the sound is different. Just when you thought you've heard every ABBA song imaginable, along comes a new version and it's always a welcome surprise. Another great addition to the album is the previously archived \\"Dream World\\". The song may not be a favourite amongst members of the group but it is beautifully sung by the girls and the melody is wonderful (love the carnival-esque introand Agnetha's solo passages). The longer version of \\"Summer Night City\\" and \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\\" are the other bonus tracks.<br /><br />The reason I purchased this deluxe edition, even though I already own a previosly remastered version of this album was for the DVD. It includes segments of their 1979 special \\"ABBA In Switzerland\\" and features several mimed performances. Despite performing to playback, the girls are delightful and both look wonderful. Prior to this release, the only way of seeing these performances was through YOUTUBE.<br /><br />The only actual live performance included is an extended version of \\"I Have a Dream\\". The DVD also features a couple of commercials for their upcoming (1979) \\"Greatest Hits: Vol 2\\" record (also available on Cassette LOL) and a rather interesting interview with the boys (minus the girls) in a European TV show.<br /><br />My only disappointments are the exclusion of the Spanish versions of \\"Chiquitita\\", \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\\" and \\"I Have a Dream\\". To some, this may seem like overkill but considering the deluxe editions of \\"Arrival\\" and \\"The Album\\" both included the Spanish versions of its songs (\\"Arrival\\" also included the Swedish version of \\"Fernando\\"), I think it would have made this volume more complete.<br /><br />VOULEZ-VOUS is one of ABBA's most energetic albums. The songs are fun and melodic but in my opinion, one of the greatest assets to this recording is the wonderful vocals by the girls. ABBA fans may cite other albums such as \\"Super Trouper\\", \\"Arrival\\" or \\"The Visitors\\" as their most accomplished but no other album really showcases the beauty and brilliance of their vocals like this one.

THROTTLE  Twin throttle was just what I was looking for and also the placement of it was very excellent.  They advance very smoothly and there is also a button which locks both of the throttles together.    HAT SWITCH  The hat switch is made of durable rubber     OTHER BUTTONS   They are very durable and will survive for a very long time    PROGRAM  The joystick is programmable by all means     MOVEMENT   The movement of this joystick is very smooth and the axis is very smooth also    All in all this joystick is excellent and an exceptional choice for FLIGHT SIM.  My name is Luke Seecharan.   I'm 14 years.
B00004R99F|5.0|My friends and I have all been obsessed with this movie since it originally came out.  Unfortunately our VHS version was stolen while we were in college.  I bought this for several of my friends as Christmas presents and they have all loved it.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This is an awesome group and the CD is great from the first song through the final song.  I've purchased this for gifts as well as for myself.  Highly recommend.
B004856SQ8|5.0|The movie was funny, action packed and surprisingly good. I loved the A team when I was little and this movie did a really good job in recreating that original A team feel. I loved the action, the cinema and action scenes were excellent and it was funny too. The story line was written well and it had a good ending.
0740797719|5.0|Within 20 minutes of receiving Color and Light and having only briefly leafed through it, I already knew it was my new favorite book, and arguably the best in my collection of over 60 art books. I fell in love so quickly that I e-mailed Mr. Gurney that same day to show my appreciation in sharing his knowledge and insight.    As a professional illustrator, this book is entirely invaluable. It's a comprehensive, easy to understand look at how to render and understand color, light, and form, with information that will help not only novices, but even the most seasoned art vets.    List price is $25, you can get it here for roughly $17 right now, but it's a book I would've gladly paid $60+ for. It's that good, worth every penny and then some.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|If you haven't already, take the time to give this film a watch. The film highlights another example of our resources being exploited, environment destroyed and health impacted by the reckless pursuit of wealth by greedy corporations. I also suggest that you take the time to urge your senators and congressmen to sponsor The Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act (H.R. 2766), (S. 1215).    [...]
B003NFM3JU|5.0|My granddaughter and I loved this Jim Carey movie.  She is nine and her school just did the Christmas Carol play so she knew what was going to happen.  Would recommend especially this time of year
1580176941|5.0|I wish I had bought this earlier.  Peterson and Fryer give fantastic detail in an orderly manner that makes decorating approachable.  Two cheers!
B002ZG997C|5.0|I watched this movie on cable and was taken in from the very beginning.  I'm not sure why many critics did not like this movie...perhaps they objected to the Biblical parts of the plot.  I've been a fan of Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman for quite some time.  Their performances were outstanding.  DW's character was brilliant and complex...played with the correct amount of restraint and brutality needed in the dangerous post-apocalyptic world. I regret not seeing this movie in a theater.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|I am a little biased being from MA/Boston - but this is up there with any drama and/or suspense movie.  For me - the realism is key - the familiarity with accurate Boston sub-culture, etc.   The acting - is really well-done - the directing by Ben Affleck is probably the best part of this movie outside the acting, as it frames the story and cinemetography.       Highly recommend - this is in my top 20 movies of all time.   As good as \\"Heat\\" or other Michael Mann flicks in terms of raw suspense - and as good as \\"Good Will Hunting\\" in terms of writing/directing.
0823016714|4.0|I use this book often for my illustrations. The photos have a wide range of emotions and camera angles. My only concern is the lighting.The book uses studio lighting, and it softens the shadows. But this is the best book on facial photo references.
B00005JNX0|2.0|Bought this just to get \\"Penguin Christmas Caper\\", which in the past was always on the Madagascar DVD.  This version DOES NOT have that great Xmas short.  Buyer beware and read descriptions more carefully than I did!  (Though we like Madagascar, we didn't feel the need to own it, so I am not commenting on the movie itself)
0596009208|5.0|When I was found this book I was trying to learn Java from Deitel&Deitel but I couldn't understand the esense because of the verbose style that they used.  Then I search about Head First in generall and I gave it a shot because of the reviews and for the teaching style that they were discribing.  I am happy that I did it. I understood Object Orientation and basic principles. Most important I had great time reading it.    It even explains a hard subject for beginners as Event Handling and makes it relatively easy to grasp.
B0000029LG|4.0|The quality of the songs in this cd is great.  I bought this cd simply because I liked the majority of the songs in this album.  The song \\"smile\\" was the bonus.  I also liked the cd booklet inside.  It contains alot of nice pictures, and is like his scrapbook of his life.  Oprah and Chelsea Clinton is in it...but not Lisa Marie?  Anyway, there is little more to add because the songs inside the album are well known already.  So you can critique the music yourself. :)
B002ZG98Z0|2.0|The ending gets better, but it's slow and lost my interest in parts. Really just not up to the hype or the rest of the series reputation.
B000YHG72E|5.0|For years, my favorite Christmas movie was always \\"A Christmas Story\\" with Ralphie and the Red Rider BB Gun.  After seeing it so many years in a row, I got a little bored with it.    Now, I have \\"Elf\\".  This movie is hilarious.  Will Farrell does a perfect job of making Buddy child-like, but really funny.  Even after watching it 20 times, I still laugh.    Christmas is not complete unless I watch this movie at least once before the 25th.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|A very good book in my option but  would be careful who reads this series. It is perfect book for  teenagers and young adults but not for kids under 12 years old. It may give them a bad reputation.   But for young adults it may be your new favorite book. This book talk's about the meaning of high school. Not just that but it also has a lesson in between the lines &#34; If you don't have the right friends and you don't try to get to know them, bad things can happend.&#34;
B000063KM1|5.0|Watching this film should be mandatory for every human being. Subjects ranging from Life & Love, War & Death, computer dating, social conformity and growing up, are all handled humorously, yet with a subtle seriousness, and dealt with realistically (and hilariously!). Incredilbly deep and moving for such a simple story from 1971. This is one of those rare life-changing films that sticks with you even decades after first watching it! You will certainly want to watch it again and share it with others just I have been doing since the late 80's. A Classic! Treat yourself and get it now!<br /><br />ONE QUIBBLE!<br />It is unfortunate & regretable that Japanese subtitles are unavailable for this film/dvd, even here in Japan!<br /><br />We purchased this region 2 version so that we could play it easily here in Japan with English subtitles and introduce some adult English students to this wonderful film. Viewing it for this purpose will require some pausing & interpreting, but we feel it will be well worth the effort. PARAMOUNT: MAKE JAPANESE SUBTITLES!!! In this rather uptight country with a huge suicide rate, this film would be a transformative journey & healing balm for many souls!<br /><br />Delivery was delayed (by the holiday rush I suspect), but it arrived in perfect shape a day before Xmas eve. I would order from Movie Mars again.
030726999X|5.0|How sad that this is the last of the Dragon Tattoo Girl books - I would love to see many more of her adventures.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|I love Josh Groban but this is not my favorite album.  I know he is trying to branch out but I am not thrilled with these selections.
0756404746|4.0|Rothfuss makes a great debut with this book. The novel follows the story of Kvothe through the lens of retrospect, and without giving up too much of the story, I will say that it is quite clear that P. Rothfuss is a \\"character builder\\" (as opposed to a \\"world builder\\", like Tolkien for instance). He does a fantastic job of describing scenes by stimulating all senses, and can keep the reader's attention even through the more morose parts, of which there are a few. He could improve his description of action scenes, and sometimes his characters act a little bewildering (out of character, if you will), but his skill for purely storytelling is second to none.    If you enjoy the likes of Tolkien and Erikson, pick this one up - its surely worth a read.
B00328G4V6|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of Hendrix but I am very much a fan. That means that I do not know everything about him and know everything he's ever produced. I'm of the age where I missed him by about 5 years. I enjoy his material yet he's hardly the only artist that I listen to. I say this so you can understand that this endorsement has more to do with the quality of the material as opposed to me worshipping anything that the artist produced.<br /><br />What makes this cd amazing, and holy smokes is it unbelievably amazing, is the sonic quality of the recordings. You have never heard Hendrix like this. This sounds like it was produced today. The nuances of Hendrix have never been so apparent as with this recording. The highs, the lows, the fingers and pick scrapping against the strings, the hum and crackle of the amps...it's all here in phenomenal audio clarity. Even Jimi's voice takes on a new dimension since you hear it in a way that you never have in the past. This is no \\"tinny\\" Foxy Lady/Hey Joe/All Along the Watch tower coming at you through your classic rock radio...this is vibrant, majestic, scorching and raw rock pulsating through all your pores.<br /><br />All the songs are great so you cannot single anything out.<br /><br />As a post script, it seems that a person of intelligence should question the authenticity of these tunes. How could such treasure be suppressed for 40 years?! Were these songs modified and overdubbed in the studio? How can the recordings be so pristine? How could there not be more fanfare when such phenomenal recordings are unearthed by such an iconic artist? I started this review out by stressing that I'm not a huge fan. Perhaps an authority on Hendrix would have an \\"educated\\" opinion on the authenticty of this project.<br /><br />Whatever it is, if you like Hendrix, then these are \\"super\\" Hendrix recordings. I give this a HUGE THUMBS UP.
B0047WJ12K|1.0|Inception is just a copy of the 1984 movie Dreamscape with Dennis Quaid. Only good thing about inception is the CGI which was not avaible back then other wise Dreamscape was far better.
B001GCUO5M|2.0|There are two ways to look at \\"Shutter Island\\".<br /><br />If an average director made it, then it would be a pretty decent movie. However, since it was made by Martin Scorsese, I expect a lot more. When you are among the best directors, you have high expectations...which I felt that this movie did not fullfill. This movie looks a lot better in the trailer than it did played out over it's full length.<br /><br />Most of \\"Shutter Island\\"is pretty good, as far as the casting (Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are great), the scenery is effective, and the sound lends to the atmosphere.<br /><br />I just thought that the story was lame (NOTE, I am purposely not going into the plot since it will impact/reveal the mystery). When the film is all done, you feel as though you watched a \\"Scooby Doo\\" ending.<br /><br />This atmospheric movie is a weak Scorsese film. It would best be compared to \\"Cape Fear\\" whic was far more effective.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book with all the action from the cornucopia down to thewolf pack and Cato.  Of course you probably do not know them, but you might soon. It is directed towards children ages 11 and up.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Very happy with this purchase. I had never purchased a workout DVD. But with time being short some evenings or bad weather to fight to get to the gym at times, I thought I'd give this a try. I like the three segment levels. Helps mix up the routine. I feel that I do get a good workout in. Sometimes I add a few minutes on my own at the end. If you really wanted to go fit it, you could do two segments for a really great workout. This isn't going to get you ready for the next Olympics, but is accomplishes exactly what I had hoped for when purchasing an exercise DVD.
0525423273|5.0|I've been reading reviews on this for quite some time, good reviews. Gushing reviews. Never bad reviews. So, I knew that I was going to love it. That was never ever a question, but just how much I loved it is pretty remarkable.<br /><br />We all love romance, right? I could do without bodice rippers, so let me rephrase that: We all love good romance right? So it shouldn't come as a shock to anyone why this is getting fantastic reviews, because its hands down the best romance I have read all year. It will leave you feeling completely warm and fuzzy, and contemplating a move to Paris.<br /><br />Everything just comes together so perfectly, but realistically. Most people don't meet and fall madly in love right away. There's usually a friendship and a few obstacles. I know I said everything comes together perfectly, but it doesn't and that's what makes it perfect! Sorry, that makes zero sense, but maybe you know what I mean.<br /><br />Etienne St. Claire--I must use his full name, that's how wonderful he is--is the ideal boy. The ideal, perfect, unrealistic boy. *sigh* He loves history, he's funny, he's sweet, he's tidy, and he's in love with Anna from the very beginning. How can you ask for anything better? Any time he was in the scene he completely stole the show. I'm hopelessly in love with him. Don't tell my husband!<br /><br />Anna was a great main character. She was smart and mature, but still flawed in realistic ways. She was the perfect match to this *sigh* perfect boy. I also loved that she was from Atlanta. I love about 2 hours away from Atlanta, so its always nice to hear about familiar places in books.<br /><br />My review has not done this book justice, at all. I can't state enough how sweet and fantastic this romance is. You're just going to have to read it yourself and find out!
B003W5C0VW|4.0|This is a great tribute to the Stones 72 concert. Dont know why they waited over 30 years to bring it out. I remember seeing it in the movies in 74' I beleive and that was the only time I saw it until now.   It has all the great songs of the era albiet, Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street.    My only minor complaint is that they dont show the audience at all, the cameras just focus on the group that is it. Good show none the less for all fans
B002ZG99QS|5.0|\\"Greetings, programs!\\"<br /><br />It was a long time coming, but the wait was worth it. While theatrical sequels to The Last Starfighter and War Games may or may not come out in the near future, and I am left hoping and praying for big-screen adaptations of Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series and Doc Smith's Lenman Series...Tron Legacy is here now (in glorious 3D) courtesy of Disney. I saw it on opening night in 3D with a huge box of kettle corn, a large group of friends...and I was first in line for the showing. Naturally my expectations were high.<br /><br />The Grid<br /><br />To be sure, this movie is visually and audibly stunning in every way. Everyone who was tantalized by the trailers and got excited by the visuals will NOT be disappointed with the art design or special effects. As they were leaving the showing before us, many people had neither a positive nor a negative expression on their face. They simply looked...stunned. Shocked. Out of it. And after seeing the movie I think I understand why.<br /><br />This must be what it felt like to see Star Wars the first time in 1977. Seeing Tron Legacy (especially without seeing the first Tron) is like being transported to an alien planet through an inter-dimensional gateway. There simply has never been anything like this on the big-screen in history. The film cost 170 million according to box office records I read online, and you can see where the money went.<br /><br />The computer world is literally a city of light. The first time you see it, it takes your breath away. The action sequences featuring light cycles, flying discs, and various flying vehicles are some of the most amazing ever captured. From the moment I saw the visuals that became the film's logo I knew the visual style of this film was spot on and I was going to love it.<br /><br />The Game Has Changed<br /><br />When you compare this movie to the first Tron, it's a MAJOR upgrade in just about every way (the one area I think it's inferior is the acting not quite on the same level). The dorky outfits of the first movie have been replaced with the new skin-tight outfits with glowing edges, the discs no longer look like ceramic Frisbees, the light cycles can make curved turns, ect. In truth, this was something I was worried about when I first saw the previews. It seemed to break from the feel of the first Tron film too much. But now...<br /><br />This is how i feel about the overall feel of Tron Legacy compared to the first: I have seen many animated TV shows that were then made into feature films, and you almost always have the same feeling that characters were changed around, and usually some past events were totally re-written. In a good movie adaptation the essence is maintained but the experience is different (like an alternate telling or a what if?). Thus, while Tron Legacy breaks from many of the traditions of Tron  (digital people now look much more like real people, real food exists in the Grid instead of just energy), at its heart it is a continuation of the story, characters, and world you have grown to love.<br /><br />Flynn Lives<br /><br />Yes, at its heart, this is the same world you loved when you saw the first Tron, with the same features and flaws. The first Tron was a visual masterpiece with unique music and visual flair, a simple but deep plot, and characters you grew to love on an age-old but engrossing quest to save the computer world and along with it the real world. This film is no different in these fundamentals. The visuals are amazing, the music is astounding, and the main plot is almost identical to the first movie (get out of system, defeat the evil program who rules the computer world with an iron fist).<br /><br />The now older Kevin Flynn who was trapped in the digital world is no less likable, but expectedly changed as anyone would be after decades spent inside a computer. His son Sam is the kind of guy you immediately like. He's rich but not snobby, attractive but not superficial,a good guy but maybe just lacking some purpose and direction in his life. At any rate, he makes a great protagonist. Jeff Bridges is a bit subdued compared to his other roles lately, but his whacky zen charm still makes him fun to watch. His digital younger (flashback and arch-nemesis) self does not fare as well because while a digital world evil Jeff Bridges that feels a bit unnatural is no problem, when it's supposed to be Kevin Flynn in the past it just comes off as strangely artificial.<br /><br />Probably the first thing everyone noticed from the trailer besides the light cycles was Olivia Wilde's character Quorra. She manages to be beautiful, innocent, courageous, loyal, child-like, fierce, and in all other ways awesome for the duration of the film. Her acting is flawless. Michael Sheen is totally over-the-top in a role that people will probably either love or hate, and Beau Garrett's Gem and Cillian Murphy's Dillinger will have you wishing they had larger roles. And of course there is one surprise I wasn't expecting regarding an old favorite character. But let's not kid ourselves...the real star of this movie is...the soundtrack!<br /><br />Derezzed<br /><br />The soundtrack...to Tron...is one of the greatest soundtracks in history. Please understand, I do not use these terms to describe a soundtrack lightly. My favorite kind of music to listen to is orchestral movie and TV music. From anime soundtracks like Vision of Escaflowne and Magic Knight Rayearth to under-rated scores like A.I. and the New World, I am a HUGE fan of orchestral tracks. I have literally hundreds of movie themes performed by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. I listen to the Star Wars soundtrack from beginning to end. I even recently wrote the Prague Philharmonic an email requesting that they record music on my wish list. That is to say...I take movie musical scores SERIOUSLY.<br /><br />You should know that I am a fan of Daft Punk's album Discovery. Look it up on Amazon and you'll see my ecstatic review. Some people have unfairly criticized the soundtrack for Tron Legacy, simply because what they wanted was another Daft Punk album, another Discovery. This is NOT a Daft Punk album. This is a FILM SCORE, featuring a full orchestra in addition to the electronic wizardry of Daft Punk. And it is destined to become legendary. From the first moments of the film when the main theme kicked in I was blown away by the music, but there is much more to it than just that the music is phenomenal.<br /><br />I would say that from 60 to 75 percent of the brilliance of this movie is the film score, and the reason for that is that the film was actually CUT to the film score, rather than the score being cut to the film. What this means, is that the film and its music are almost perfectly synchronized. Anyone who has watched a really good AMV on the Internet has seen the magic that happen when you cut the action to the music and it works magic in this film. The disc battles, light-cycle sequences, and chase scenes and fight scenes (Derezzed being the stand-out) are incredible because of how the music not only fits, but drives these scenes. And when the epic climax of the movie rolls around the music makes it a hundred times better because it is brilliant, and it is so loud, so strong, so appropriate, and so flat-out amazing that it just makes everything WORK. Some have said that they listened to the music on its own in order to more fully appreciate it. I say the opposite. See the movie to appreciate how the music was MEANT to be used. Awesome.<br /><br />The Creator<br /><br />Some critics and others might dismiss Tron Legacy as a simple candy-coated popcorn flick with all the depth of Super-Bowl commercial. \\"Tron Legacy isn't actually trying to be smart\\"? You have got to be kidding me. But then again...people said EXACTLY the same thing when the first Tron came out, and when the Matrix movie came out as well. I'm starting to think that every time someone says a moviehas no plot what they really mean is \\"I didn't understand it.\\"<br /><br />This movie is NOT simplistic. The spiritual overtones of Tron once again are pronounced. Love them or hate them, they are what drive this story, not the basic premise of the plot. In the first Tron the Users were seen as gods, the ones who had a plan for everything, the great beings who watched over the Grid with benevolence. When Tron was given a mission by his User, it was akin to pulling The Sword From The Stone or learning to Use The Force. Likewise, Kevin Flynn's User powers are seen from time to time, making him seem like a sort of mythological wizard (Merlyn, Gandalf, or better yet Obi-Wan Kenobi from Star Wars: A New Hope). When the creatures of his self-created Grid turn on him we cannot help but see an allusion to our own world where in films and popular culture everyone sees to be angry at God despite the fact that he made them. This spiritual metaphor does not come off as silly or cheesy (at least in my opinion) but rather lends significant gravity to an otherwise straightforward plot.<br /><br />There you have it. The new Tron is an amazing film in just about every way. Not perfect, but definitely the best movie to come out in years. The 3D is nice, but not required, as it is not quite up to the par of Alice in Wonderland and Avatar. It would be better to see this film on a digital screen where the wonders of the world of the Grid can really shimmer and pop off the screen in razor sharp detail (the icing on the cake would be digital 3D). I've seen it multiple times in the theater. You should do the same. This one movie you do not want to rent and watch on a tiny TV for your first viewing. You want to see it on the big screen. And then buy the Blu Ray and watch it on your home theater. This is one movie that would show off a high-def setup in spectacular fashion.d was another Daft Punk album, another Discovery.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|More than I expected. 3 versions of the same movie: original theatrical version, special edition re-release and new 3-hour extended cut. I'm very glad, thank you.
1440503257|2.0|a great idea, but if there is ONE thing anyone who bought this book wants, it is a recipe for butter beer.  I doubt this was anything other than a copyright issue.  Someone who put so much thought and research into a book like this would have never overlooked that.  Thank-you google.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Based on the bestselling novel by Ayn Rand, this movie is a classic. It holds up so well. Gary Cooper as the ultimate hero performs with strength and gusto. Providing the romantic interest, Patricia Neal presents a perfect foil to his gritty performance. The final courtroom scene presents a monologue to remember.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|I've watched this every Xmas since it came out and it never ages, just like other real yuletime classics such as A Christmas Story, Scrooged, and of course the best of the bunch, the original Grinch. But Elf has its very own wonderfully weird flavor, mainly due to one of Ferrell's finest turns on camera.<br /><br />Will does innocent/goofy as well as anyone ever has, and this is his peak in that realm. It's hard to imagine anybody else even touching this performance, and he's given excellent support by Bob Newhart and James Caan, among others. There are so many good laughs you can't count them, at least one a minute all the way through.<br /><br />The blu-ray was done quite perfectly, a near-flawless transfer, with lots of extras including a nice commentary track with Will alone. The guy is as dry as a Bond martini, and always entertaining. Director Favreau also has one, and he's to be commended for his work here, especially the many unusual pastel colors and semi-real scenes that really glow in blu-ray. Elf is fun to watch just for the eye candy, in fact.<br /><br />But there's so much more to enjoy here; add in the endless sly humor and very real heart and you've got one of the all-time great Christmas laugh fests.

They decide they aren't ready to have a family, so Juno needs to find a family that will adopt her baby.

B000002UJQ|5.0|1997. At home. Watching MTV. Suddenly this song came on, with this animated music video. The caption said RADIOHEAD - PARANOID ANDROID - OK COMPUTER. After I listen to 6 minute song, I went out to the closest record store and bought this album, with 2 other albums I didn't even knew existed, Pablo Honey and The Bends. This was about 8 at night, so it was weird just going to the record store in the city.<br /><br />  I popped the CD in the player and listened. I sat on my couch and listened, spacing out and daydreaming with the help of Thom Yorke's melodic vocals. The album blew my mind. I went into bed and had a good sleep. And let me tell you, it was the BEST SLEEP of my life.<br /><br />  I'm happy to say I still have that same CD today. I even ripped it onto my computer and put it on my iPod. It is an album of nostalgic memories and it reminds me of when MTV was good. Hell, without MTV, I would have never bought that album on that night. I have over 6 copies of OK Computer, 3 CDs, 2 Vinyls, and a Cassette. I call it, the best album. And when I die, my soul will still listen to that album, OK Computer.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|The story of the man who wrote Peter Pan, author James M. Barrie, Finding Neverland features another phenomenal performance by Johnny Depp. As the story begins, playwright Barrie (Depp) has staged a recent flop and his producer (Dustin Hoffman) is getting impatient.<br /><br />Finding Neverland presents a fictional account of Barrie's creative life and the inspirations that helped bring Peter Pan to the stage. Barrie meets the four Davies boys and their mother, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) in London's Kensington Gardens. Captured by their boyish imagination and touched by the recent loss of their father, he begins to tell them stories and is eventually inspired to write a play about a boy who stays young forever. The Davies boys show him Neverland, and he shows it to the world.<br /><br />Depp, with his own boyish looks and childhood spirit, is perfect as Barrie. Freddie Highmore, who portrays the young Peter Davies, gives a remarkable toughness and sensitivity to his first movie role.
030746363X|4.0|Im pretty OCD about exercise and fitness... and business so I love Tim's insights and experimentations because he is a whole other world of OCD - and he's brilliant with it!    Sex, exercise, eating - definitely in the top 5 most important things in life (in my opinion). The only thing not covered is business and thats in his other book the Four Hour Work Week, which is AWESOME!    I think there is a lot to be learned from this book. As he rightly states/admits it's not all his own first hand experience, some of it is, a lot of it he has found experts and drawn conculsions from their work based on his own self experimentation - Brilliant! Thanks for doing the hard work!    Like any book like this (and as Tim states) you should pick and choose the bits most relevant to you.     It's a raw, OCD take on the human body - thank you for punlishing this. Finally a book that aknowledges medicine though goes with what's actually going on.    I highly recommend you buy this book even if you only learn one thing from it, it will be worth it.     Time to stop being fat and ignorant and take control and responsibility for your life!      Cheers Tim!
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Bought this for my 2 gandchildren 2 1/2 and 1 1/2.  We watched it 4 (or was it 5) times in 3 days.  Perfect for the 2 1/2 year old--sat riveted each time.  Only drawback  repeated \\"stupid dog\\" (of course what you would prefer them NOT to say!)  Great movie.  Highly recommend.
0345505387|4.0|I am an \\"Outlander\\" fan first and foremost and out of that quest for more Jamie and Claire, plus seeing the \\"original\\" art for the wedding night scene, I pre-ordered this book in a flash. Other than your usual comic books growing up and some Classics Illustrated, I had never read a graphic novel. \\"THE EXILE\\" was a most pleasant surprise! The cover and quality of the book itself was much better than I expected and the artwork was wonderful. Being familiar with the story left few surprises which was not a problem; it was entertaining and, as one revewier put it, seeing Jamie sans clothes even from the backside was worth the price.  :-)              A lot of work went into putting this book into being and I commend all on a job well done.  Why did I only give it 4 stars?  Well, because since a review is simply each individual's personal opinion, mine is that I would have loved to see it be a great deal longer and cover more of the \\"Outlander\\" story.  Guess I will have to hope I live long enough to see future ones!  Enjoying the \\"Outlander\\" series as much as I do and already having in my collection all the books, the CD of \\"Outlander,the Musicial\\", and now the graphic novel, I look forward to hopefully DB's new books, a possibly future musical and tv miniseries or movies, and any thing that brings Jamie, Claire, and the \\"Outlander\\" folk back to us.  As I said in my intro line......simply a new way to enjoy it all.
B0017I1FO4|4.0|I bought this album mainly for 2 songs, but I like pretty much every song.  It's something that I don't listen to all of the time, but quite often.
140120841X|1.0|I bought this product for my son's english class and was greatly disappointed when I received it and it was not the full graphic novel.  It was only a small booklet with a chapter.  I had to turn around and quickly buy another so my son would have the book for class.  Very Disappointing!  Be sure you know what you are buying when you purchase from this seller!
B001BP4UJA|5.0|I had this album many years ago, at time there were many new bands happening. It was like every week I would be buying new lps with some totally different sounds. Can, Faust and of course Neu, i liked them all but this and the black and white albums by Neu were my favourites.
B0036OS3EM|5.0|Item received in great conditions!  These boots are really comfortable.  Perfect for cold weather.  They keep my feet warm and dry! And they look nice!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This DVD was a gift and I am sure it is a good movie but I have not seen it....
143911000X|4.0|For fans of \\"How I Met Your Mother\\" this is an amusing, light read.  For the few naysayers posting negative reviews on the Amazon site I wonder if they've ever seen HIMYM?  If they had the snarky, misogynistic humor of the Barney Stinson character would come as no surprise.  You're not getting Hemingway from a book titled \\"The Bro Code\\".
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|I would rather burn my eyes out with a aids infected hypodermic needle while listening to justin bieber than watch this crud ever again.  Someone please put these poor dogs down.
B003ES61EE|5.0|I have used both this Amazon Lens Pen and the Nikon lens pen. I like the Amazon pen better. Let me tell you why ....<br /><br />The Amazon pen is very similar to the Nikon pen at first glance. However, after some use a few differences become apparent. First, the Amazon pen is somewhat slimmer. Second, the brush fibers are longer, which makes them a little more flexible. Third, I originally thought that the Nikon pen's pad end has no cap while the Amazon pen does. What I discovered is that the Nikon pen's cap simply refuses to stay on: it fits poorly and removes itself from the end easily, especially in a camera bag that is typically filled with accessories. Fourth, the pad of the Amazon pen flexes, and you can remove and flip the pad end to a smaller pad. The smaller pad is triangular and lets you get to the corners of the viewfinder. Very handy, very useful. I pulled and pulled on this end of the Nikon pen and was unable to remove it.<br /><br />The packaging was easy to open, protective, and lightweight. A little large, yes, but nothing to thrash your chest about.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great product, a better value and better features than the Nikon lens pen. Sounds like a deal to me!
1439156816|4.0|I have only read one King book (Misery), but another memorist/writer whose book I enjoyed recommended this<br />in her end pages, so I bought and enjoyed it.  The writing tips are for would-be writers at the most elementary<br />stage, and if that is you, you'll find every bit of the book useful and enjoyable.  If not, there is a lifestory here that --to me--<br />was worth the price of the book.
B000YDI9UG|4.0|Great boots, fits like a glove during first day. Don't take these boots in inclimate weather conditions, they are not insulated and will not be able to handle it. Otherwise, a great boot for knocking around the yard and to wear on a day hike. Highly recommend. Oh yeah, they are sized 1 full size too large. I am a 11 1/2 to 12 and the 11s that I bought are still too big but they do allow for a separately bought insole and double layer of socks if I opt. A 10 1/2 would be ideal.
B003HC8I5M|3.0|Ok Phil youre true to Motown here in every respect, waaaay too much true.   But come on... you wrote \\"Two Hearts\\" With Lamont Dozier. Get the groove back.  Nice, but maybe, too nice.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Ihave read all the Twilight books and have seen the movies also.  I love the actors in all 3 movies and am glad they are in all except Victoria in Eclipse.  I liked the original Victoria.  I hope the last movies keep the same original actors or I will be let down if I watch the remainder movie Breaking Dawn. Can't wait to see this movie either.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I live on the opposite side of Missouri from where this is movie/novel is set. This is set in the Ozarks, and was filmed in the Branson/Springfield area. I live at the edge, where the Ozarks start to give way to the Mississippi Plain (Southeast Missouri). But the results are still the same, in rural Missouri as in other places I'm sure, there is little chance for advancement, so often the people and their kids turn to either a \\"check,\\" or other means, which often involves cooking meth. With or without kids present.   This film really looks at a growing problem in rural America. Parents turning to other means to make money, and the kids are the ones in the middle. Often left parentless, or to be raised by grandparents or left with the state to care for. I have seen an increase in kids raised by grandparents because mom and dad are in prison because of meth. Sometimes parents cook meth with their kids present, and the chemicals that are used are extremely toxic. Often a house that has been used to cook meth must me gutted while wearing hazmat suits. So you can imagine what can happen to kids breathing in those fumes and playing on the carpet that those fumes soak into. Open sores, loss of hair, etc.   These kids often grow up to perpetuate the problem, cook meth themselves with their own kids present. It is so bad that the state of Missouri has enacted a law requiring any over the counter drug with Ephedrine to require a doctor's prescription.   The film looks at just how a meth cooker's kids can be caught in the middle. With her father gone, and their property put up for his bond, this family may lose their home. Which leaves the only member of the family, the 17 year old daughter to look after her two younger siblings, her mentally ill mother, to forage for food when needed, and to even play detective and search for her father in order to get him to show up to court so they can keep their property. But she may have bitten off more than she can chew, and there are others about who do not want her to find out where her daddy is.   I have been to the houses you see, I saw a lot here from my teenage years, when at that time I hung out with some people I shouldn't have hung out with. I had friends like those in the movie, some of whom made it to better things, some of whom did not, and now live in flea infested trailers eeking out a living doing little more than odd jobs and cooking meth. Today I have many of these kids in my classroom. I see what can happen to kids when they've been done this way.   So know when you watch this movie your seeking something \\"real,\\" as real as a film can portray it anyway.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I have been looking for a reliable FM transmitter for some time and have hesitated buying one after reading mixed reviews. I recently discovered the Soundfly AUX and based on the excellent reviews took a chance on the product. I must say that I was blown away at the performance of this small device. I have had it for a few weeks now and while it worked flawlessly in my neighborhood, I have been holding off writing a review until I took it on a road trip. I just came back from a 265 mile drive through sections of PA, NJ, and NY and to my utter disbelief, I didn't need to change the transmit channel once. I anticipated and dreaded the need to change the transmit frequency a number of times along the way but the need never arose. I must assume that the Soundfly's output power is quite extraordinary to overpower FM signals encountered on the trip.     I have spoken to Arthur in customer service a few times and he is not only available, but also very helpful. There is a mistake in the manual regarding the set up of the Preset Memories and he explained the proper procedure. He also alerted me to [...] which is a great way to locate vacant FM channels.    I have all my songs on an 8GB mini-SD card and operate the Soundfly in shuffle mode. The display is quite good and I can see the track info as it is played. I suggest setting the unit at max volume initially. Volume is then controlled exclusively by the radio.    I expect that there will be areas where I will have to change frequencies and once I know which frequencies are best, I can preset up to four.    In summary, I find this to be a great product and well worth the price.
0061537969|5.0|Everyone who is a dog lover or knows a dog lover, should read this book.The seniors in my book club just loved it. It is funny and real. You can relate to Enzo in every way. sometimes I think the world would be better if we thought with the clarity and love of a dog.     Great book
B003L0V758|1.0|Don't be fooled, people. Those eighty reviews up there that say \\"5-Stars\\" are not fully analyzing the music. I can see what Janelle Monae is trying: smashing together several different genres to somehow stem appreciation for all types of music. An admirable idea, yes, however this is not the end result of the album ArchAndroid. I would not recommend purchasing it; the songs are confusing and, essentially, are just a lot of sounds and spoken words slammed together with guitar and salsa beats. Even at $3.99, it's just not worth the money.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|I'm a big fan of Kanye West since Graduation. I think he is one the best hip hop artists. He is very inovative and his lyrics are not about guns,drugs and cribs.I have all his albums and there is a huge progress. My beautiful dark twisted fantasy is the best album of Kanye West,maybe the bast album of the year.
B0043A0PXU|2.0|This music is so wrong.     There should be tenderness and/or joy  in Christmas music.       A lot of people have remarked that Annie's voice is harsh on this album.  I'm not sure that is the right word,  I think technically she sings as well as ever.  The emotional content is just so ridiculous, this is music for a Saturday Night Live comedy sketch featuring pissed-off carolers.    I'll give it two stars for effort on  \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\" and \\"Universal Child\\"
B002ZG9788|5.0|I'm so glad I waited until this version went down in price or went on sale. Although, I loved the original one much better since I'm an \\"old school kinda guy\\".
B002ZG98Q4|5.0|I can't say enough about how much I loved this movie!! It is seriously just an all around perfect Disney movie!  Even though it went a stray from the hand drawn art that Disney used to do, I can't complain because the animation was absolutely amazing! I've seen the movie 3 times and can't wait to see it again it is just that good! And just one of those movies you wanna keep watching over and over and you still are engaged in it every time!  The detail that Disney animation paid in this movie is unreal, Rapunzel's hair and the movements of her and Flynn Rider not only express emotion but are so detailed they couldn't get any better!  The music is a whole other amazing feat for Disney but that's because it's by Alan Menken and the other Disney movies he scored are all favorites of mine! It's epic to the point where it fits everything PERFECTLY, but not overpowering~! I absolutely LOOOOVEEEE the music in Tangled, it's perfect for each scene and suitable for the characters!  Plus you really shouldn't look at this movie from a critics point of view, even though that's how many will~it's just for pure enjoyment, you'll laugh a lot-you'll cry a lot-you just get so involved in this film you can't even think of bad points for it!  I know I'll be buying this DVD the second it hits shelves and I know I'll be seeing it AT LEAST 2 more times in the theater!! I cannot get enough of it!!!! So what are you waiting for?! GO SEE IT!!!
B0042RUMJG|3.0|[[ASIN:B0042RUMJG Sting Live In Berlin [Blu-ray]]]    Saw this concert in person, so I looked forward to the same symphonic performance on BLU RAY. STING is great, and he re-invents his songs with the Philharmonic in wonderful ways. END OF GAME and ROXANNE are particularly wonderful. Also STING's voice sounds great and he delivers with range, power and endurance.     The picture quality of the BLU RAY is very sharp, very video sharp to be more specific and gives you a true \\"live\\" experience if you are into that. However, given that it was recorded in 60i, not 60p (or 24p), it is not a progressive recording and you can see a lack of resolution and depth because of this in under-lit areas and wider shots on stage; keep in mind that your 1080p TV will render the 60i material as 60p but it would be best if it were recorded progressively to start with.  The camera work is slow moving or locked off and it works and the editorial is simple and seems to work as well. The color correction is very simple and they seem to have only relied on making everything look consistent rather than give the show a real \\"look\\" like the beautiful rich look JOHN MAYER got on his WHERE THE LIGHT IS Blu Ray for example.     The audio appears to be well recorded and of high quality. However, the 5.1 audio mix is very poor: it sounds like all the audio engineers have done is give us a 5-channel stereo mix rather than a true 5.1 mix. In a true 5.1 mix, STING's vocals would be mostly in the center channel and the instruments in the Front L/R and the ambiance and crowd reaction in the Rear L/R, with low frequencies in the sub/LFE. But in the 5.1 mix provided every single speaker has the same audio mix coming out of it which sounds muddy and causes STING's voice to sound layered and echo. For better, cleaner sound, stick to the 2.0 Stereo PCM mix for this Blu Ray. Again JOHN MAYER got a much better sonic result for his audio mix on his WHERE THE LIGHT IS Blu Ray which is a reference quality pictureand audio quality Blu Ray shot in 35MM and HD.     Extra Features have an interesting interview with STING and Marsalis. All good here except they put some soft lighting filter (like a soap opera) all over STING's face for this interview which has been overdone for no good reason I can think of. I mean STING looks great and does not need a soft light to \\"glow out\\" his wrinkles!    Overall it is a good purchase for a STING fan. But I wish they had taken the time in the on stage lighting, color correction and I wish it had a much better 5.1 mix for what was an amazing concert.
030746363X|2.0|I loved the 4 Hour Workweek and have enjoyed reading Tim's blog for the last several years, but the 4 Hour Body is a terrible book and a huge disappointment. To begin with, the book consists largely of rewritten/rehashed posts from TIm's blog, restructured and with a bit of additional content. Second, the structure of the book, and even of each chapter, is a total mess, lacking clarity of structure, flow and continuity. It's as if Tim took his blog posts, through them together into one book, added a little bit of extra content, and put hardly any thought into how they all connect together. Structurally it's a catastrophe and this makes it very difficult to read and use the information in the book. Third, the \\"science\\" of it is dubious at best, relying primarily on anecdotal evidence to support wild claims. Remember TIm, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. In this book the claims are made but there is a lack of credible and substantial evidence, unless you consider the results for Tim's dad credible. Fourth, the book is outrageously self-promotional. Get over yourself Tim. If you write about things of substance and credibility then you will lose the need to promote yourself in the ways you have. Fifth, the writing itself is simply terrible. Was this outsourced? Sixth, each chapter concludes with a long list of things Tim recommends one buys to achieve similar results to those he claims to have achieved. The book is, in many ways, one big advertisement. Don't waste your time on this book. If you're wondering why there are so many good reviews check out Tim's blog - he's spent huge sums of money promoting the book, offering prizes/bribes to those who promote it, etc. I would wager the majority of the 5 star reviews are from his \\"followers\\". I've loved reading Tim's blig over the years and learned a lot from it and from the 4 Hour Work Week, but this book is a terrible book, a huge disappointment, a waste of time, and a really poor effort on Tim's part.Save your time and money and buy something with credibility.
B002ZG98J6|4.0|Normally I avoid watching movies that are adapted from a book, however I'm delighted to say that I feel this movie was a good adaptation of the book. Of course due to time constraints there are entire parts from the book left out from the movie. That aside, the actors seem to have been wisely chosen and act the same way as the characters in the book. If you've read the book, don't skip this movie over on the thought that they would have done a poor job of adapting it. They didn't! If you haven't read the book, it's ok! The movie does a fantastic job standing on its own. You won't be left behind by not having read the book.
B00003CXA6|5.0|For anyone who is into real history this one is a keeper. One of the best movies ever made, and certainly one of the best Civil War Movies.  The acting is great.  The accuracy and the writing is terrific.  Deserves to be a true classic.  The finest performance by Jeff Daniels ever.
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|The first time I listened to this album I was taken aback by the different turn in Clapton's music, and wondered where the 'From the Cradle' blues drive had gone. The second time I listened to 'Clapton', I fell in love with it and it's been one of my fav Clapton albums ever since.   I appreciate that Clapton is always trying to re-invent himself--he may as well keep playing the same old blues songs, which he does perfectly, but he feels he needs to explore other fields. It's a brave move, and it's risky, as it always is for artists who are associated with (entrapped in) a particular musical genre.  The legion of musicians featuring in the album is overwhelmingly good--the style, the sound is just pure perfection. Each note is where it's supposed to be, with a lightness of touch that carries you away, so liquid. Tracks like 'The River Runs Deep' are amazing for their smoothness and the way in which all the instruments sound as one is just incredible. Clapton's guitar does not emerge powerfully rocking, but is there in the background with the rhythm and melodic solos. Clapton's voice has really improved over the years, as is evident in 'Rocking Chair' and 'Autumn Leaves'. And he clearly enjoyed each and every minute of the recording.  This passion, this deep love for each and every note, is what transpires from the whole album. His guitar is there, his voice is there, his feeling is there. It's just another kind of songs.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|Summer Wars is not an Anime movie. Is not a matter of sit in your favorite couch and enjoy something that may make you laugh or cry. It is real and deep poetry that will invade your soul and make you think, feel and question your own life, your own existence and how you relate with your others and in general with the world.     I am not reviewing in fact this release as this is yet a preorder. But I've already watched the movie about four times and every time I watch it, I love it more and more. Also, I don't want to give you spoilers as that are annoying and the magic of this movie resides basically on its own essence, the surprise factor.     The only I can say is that this movie resembles what Miyazaki San and other great creators always wanted to transmit in their movies / series. That the magic, the love, the fantasy lives in each of us and that greatness can flow out once in a while to give dreams in a cruel and simple world as ours.     Cheers,
B004EKCNMA|1.0|We were excited to watch a Christmas movie of a classic story, but this was not at all what we were expecting. It has some very scary and disturbing scenes for kids so let me be quite clear THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE!!! There are much better versions of movies for this great story. This has nothing to do with the quality of the movie, just the content. I really don't like writing bad reviews, but this was sadly disappointing.
0920236251|1.0|I have a regular sized book of this story and love love love it.  So I ordered two copies for Christmas gifts.  I didn't read the reviews or description because as I said I already know the book.   Imagine my shock when I got my order and the books are 3 inches big!   Definitely not happy!!
B002VECM6S|5.0|I think this is Sandra Bullocks best movie yet.I also loved it because I could let my grandchildren watch it too.The true story was so touching and uplifting.Its not often that a really great family movie comes along. Ilove that Amazon .com has such great movies. Keep up the great job.
0316078913|5.0|If you are in need of a laugh, I highly recommend reading this book!  I read it on an airplane as my husband tried to watch the airline movie.  I kept laughing and snorting.  My husband could not share my enthusiasm, having no idea what I was reading, so he became annoyed.   When I thought I could finally compose myself, I would read on, and that was it, forget any composure!  Sedaris not only has a great humorous mind, his words are brilliant.  I believe this and much of Sedaris' work qualifies as lasting literature.  I purchased eight books to give to friends for Christmas... a perfect gift!
B0013V33DG|4.0|This is a wonderful production for those who like their opera to be more than the principals taking it in turns to stand at the front of the stage singing arias. Natalie Dessay, in particular, has an amazing gift for being able to perform quite strenuous activities while maintaining control over her voice. I was left wondering how she does it. Juan Diego Florez, while not in the same class as a comedian, sings the role of Tonio beautifully; at this stage in his career this is the right kind of material for him, as his voice is a little light for more serious roles. No doubt the extra weight will come as he matures. For now, those brilliant high Cs are worth watching for alone.    The supporting cast is uniformly excellent and it was a stroke of genius to cast Dawn French in the (non-singing) role of the Duchess. She has the audience laughing in a way that a more traditional actor could not hope to achieve. Ms. Dessay is also a great comic and could easily act in a comedy without singing (though I hope she won't, I'd be sad to see her without hearing that lovely voice).    I've given this 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it could have been better in some ways. I didn't care for the sets and would have preferred brighter backgrounds and lighting. The DVD also came with no extras, and these days it should be routine to include some behind-the-scenes material, interviews, etc. Lastly, the subtitles, as others have said, were poor; I know a little French (not Dawn) and the subtitles didn't accurately represent the lyrics. However, as a fun, relatively short and wonderfully performed comic opera, this release takes a lot of beating.
B0049D1TCM|5.0|Being a fan of mixtape Nicki I thought this album would be a departure from her former self and while there is some pop influenced tracks(check it out save me fly here I am and last chance with natasha bedingfield) there's also enough of old Nicki to keep all of her Beam Me Up Scotty fans happy. I wold say that anybody who says nickis all about signing boobs and making funny faces and changing her voice there completely wrong.Its songs like Dear Old Nicki Moment 4 Life and Save Me that we get to see Onika and I'm pretty sure this will go down as not only the most solid female rap album in awhile but a solid Rap Album in general..F first week sales kanye didn't deserve that
B002ZG9940|5.0|...but the commercial was not an accurate interpretation.  Highly recommend seeing this, but if you are ignorant and don't accept anything other than what you absolutely think you MUST see, do not watch.
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|I ordered a dvd through this seller as Christmas gift for someone, I ordered it Tuesday the 21st and got it on the 24th that Friday! I was very impressed on how fast it got here!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This movie had very few theaters showing it. The few big companies that are gaining more and more power in the increasingly corporatist/fascist USA really don't want you to see this movie. Inside Job is fascinating and you'll want to share it with everyone. It documents how Wall Street and the US government (both parties) are a rapidly growing plutocracy that has committed $Trillions in fraud as partners in crime against We The People.  Hopefully this movie will become a DVD sensation and tens of millions will be energized to speak out loudly in defense of our economic liberty to prevent future generations from becoming serfs. Please watch this movie and share it with everyone.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I really like the \\"Extended Cut's\\" & the \\"Unrated Versions\\", and also the \\"Director's Versions\\"; but I do not like owning 2 or 3 copies of the same movie!<br /><br />I wish they would let you know up front what is available!
B002ZG999U|4.0|The secret to enjoying this testosterone-laden flick is to not take it too seriously. Don't look for any profound messages--there weren't supposed to be.<br /><br />The script was like a fusion of Megaforce and some of the paramilitary adventure fiction from the 1980s. You know--that decade when the big name actors in this cast (Stallone, Swarzenneger, Willis, Lundgren...) were lighting up the box office with huge Hollywood explosions. During a recon for some merc work in a Third World dictatorship, Sly Stallone and Jason Statham inadvertently befriend the altruistic daughter of the dictator before making a grand exit from the nation and basically saying (with actions-speak-louder-than-words panache), \\"take this job and shove it.\\"<br /><br />But back stateside, Sly has an attack of conscience about leaving the fair damsel (Giselle Iti&eacute;) at the mercy of the dastardly despot and his Evil Capitalist Puppetmaster. He's going back in to get her, doggone it, alone with no plan. But even Sly might have trouble taking on an entire nation by himself, so his merc buddies come along for the pyrotechnic ride. Jet Li, the most mercenary of these mercenaries, is the first to put friendship before money and commit to stick with his comrade come napalm or high pungis. Now you have an adequate excuse for a martial arts shoot-em-up Hollywood Fireball Fest, and director/star Stallone delivers, big-time.<br /><br />I was expecting it to be far more obvious tongue-in-cheek parody of the genre, but they took a slightly more marketable route, ensuring it's not SO stupid that young adults wouldn't like it. But it's got just enough stupidity, delivered with such finesse, that I had a grand ol' time and laughed out loud on several occasions.<br /><br />The martial arts segments would have been much more pleasing without all the avant garde camera work, and I could have done without all the close-ups on Stallone's jewelry. But there was a little bit of everything for action flick buffs: A smorgasbord of cinematic fight scene superstars who all get some thumping time; a car chase in which a beautiful old fat-fender stepside hot rod pickup gets shot and smashed to pieces; more exploding ordinance than the Falklands campaign; and some gratuitous gore that is either horrific or hilarious, depending on your mood and personality disorder.<br /><br />Once upon a time, I fantasized about making a mindless action flick with a cast like this...but when they were all a little shorter in the tooth. Along with Sly, Arnie and Dolph I would have cast Norris, Bronson, Eastwood, Van Damme, Ventura, Carl Weathers, Fred Williamson and Jim Brown. Can you imagine the mayhem and blood-curdling dialog? If my time machine could go back far enough, I'd draft Lee marvin and Robert Mitchum, too.<br /><br />This isn't The Dogs of War, nor is it Commando. It's not completely sober, but it doesn't descend into campiness, either. What it can be, if you kick the girls and snobs out of the Man Cave for a couple hours, is a lot of fun.<br /><br />Henry Brown is the author of TEOTWAWKI aviation adventure The Delayed Blitz(Krieg), as well as the military thriller Hell and Gone.

B001P06GX4|4.0|I received this for my 30th birthday and have loved playing this great strategy game.  The instructions include variations on how to play which was very helpful.  I also love using this in my middle school classroom with my students.  Great for practicing logic and critical thinking.  I also love that the games are 20-30 minutes long.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|Just a word of warning.  Yes, this is the full Nausicaa movie from 20+ years ago, plus with some extra footage thrown in that wasn't in the original American import version.  And, yes, some of the voices include Uma Thurman and Shia Laboufe (sp?), but it has been slightly Disneyized.  I noticed specifically some of the more important dialogue was changed, which perhaps was a result of a retranslation of the original Japanese animation movie.  But, this had me sit up straight in my chair a couple times and say, \\"No, that's not what that person really says.\\"<br /><br />All in all, it's the same movie, just slightly different.  But, my heart still yearns for the original US adaptation.  It was better.

Along the way, he begins to lose sense of what made him become a clergyman, and the importance of his family.<br /><br />An angel (Cary Grant), helps lead him to an awareness of what really matters in life. You really, absolutely must see this movie at Christmastime.

One viewing, and you'll love it forever!
0385473788|5.0|The definitive edition is Anne's heavily collection of diary entries. She wanted to become a writer. And the Definitive Edition is only a fraction of all we can ever know about Anne Frank as the writer. I really, really like this book. Anne did an excellent job of preserving her wartime experience in the Secret Annex. (If only she could have lived to publish it herself.) I use the word \\"preserving\\" because she reviewed the original material and explanded upon it.<br /><br />Anne lets us get a feel for the whole experience in hiding. We feel her claustrophobia, her restlessness, her romantic feelings for Peter, her frustration, her hopes, etc. We are transported to the terrible time that ws the world from 1942- Aug 1944. Anne provides occassional updates on the war. Anne talks about the weather, and it's not just a sort of \\"filler\\". She wants us to know what it was like to walk through the sweltering streets of Amsterdam just to get to an appointment; Jews couldn't take the trams. We can imagine a warm July rain pouring on us as we leave our nice apartment house for the unknown... the Secret Annex.<br /><br />We can see Anne's spiritual and moral development mature.<br /><br />And the diary is also a snapshot of a teenager's mentality. Her feelings towards Mrs. van Dam for example. We know that, in the end, Mrs. van Dam cares for Margot and Anne as they suffer from typhus in Bergen-Belsen. Mrs. van Dam took Anne to be reunited with her long lost friend, Hanneli.<br /><br />Anne's feelings towards her mother and sister can be very raw. We know that, in Auschwitz, Mrs. Frank snuck food to Anne and Margot when both girls were in the infirmary. Anne, suffering from scabies, was voluntarily accompanied by Margot to the infirmary.<br /><br />When we read Anne's diary, we are aware of her fate. Yet, because she makes herself and everyone else so vivid, we cringe because we know that they will attempt to stay together as a family, through the hell they endured after their arrest.<br /><br />The definitive edition is the one to read as an older teen and up.rest.<br /><br />The definitive edition is the one to read as an older teen and up.
1592802974|5.0|This book is the first one of the Market Wizard series from Schwager and also the best book. Some of the most succesfull traders of the past decennia are in dept interviewed in this book. I think Jack Schwager did an excellent job as interviewer. I have also red other books with interviews with famous traders, but they don't seem to get that much out these interviews.<br /><br />There is too much information in this book to give a summary here in my comment, I can only advise you to read this book if you haven't done so already. Even now, in 2010 (almost 2011) there are still tons of useful information in this book. Don't expect concrete tips in what to invest, but rather stories on how these guys achieved there (enormous) successes.<br /><br />My favorite interviews:<br /><br />- Richard Dennis (in my opinion one of the greatest traders of all times, also known from the turtle experiment)<br />- Ed Seykota (I had to read it several times, but there certainly is usefull stuff in this interview)<br />- Marty Schwartz (also the author from Pitbull Trader; very inspiring story)<br />- Tony Saliba (with his tactic of buying OTM calls for almost nothing, speculating on a highly unexpected move)<br /><br />I think one should not try to read this book in one piece, but rather story by story. You can also read these interviews again a while after you've already red them. I've already red most of these interviews 3 to 4 times and I'm still getting more information out of them.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|I've just watched this movie for the first time. The only thing that was wrong with this movie is that it was REALLY scary in some parts.  Also I regret not seeing it in the theater while it was showing in 3D.  I can tell that it was made for a 3D audience and I feel like I missed out on that part of the movie.  Other than that it's exactly as I remember all the other versions of it.  It's a must see film for the whole family. (As long as the kids are over 10.)
B003UESJHO|5.0|\\"The Fighter\\" is a very engrossing movie, one of the best films of the year, but don't be fooled by some of the reviews; it is still part of the very durable boxing film genre with lots of scenes of fights. The movie is based on a real story of the fighter, Micky Ward, whose legendary bouts with Arturo Gatti are not reenacted in the movie.<br />Mark Wahlberg is superb as the fighter Micky Ward, and in the unsympathetic role of his brother, Christian Bale does a superlative job. Dicky was Micky's older brother, and Micky always hero-worshipped him, a boxer whose claim to fame was that he had knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard in a fight.<br />He is supposed to be Mick's trainer, and the hard-nosed, termagant mother is supposedly his manager. Dicky is so addicted to and in the service of a bad crack problem that he is a lousy trainer.<br />It takes place in gritty Lowell, Mass, one of those New England cities that never saw recent economic boom periods, but lived and still live in a state of decline and decay. Many of the shots show the mill town as it was and is.<br />Melissa Leo is Alice, the mother of a huge brood; she's tough, brassy, bossy and favors Dicky. It is a role that will deservedly be in contention for an Academy Award.<br /> Certain elements in the story add comedy. Alice's seven grown-up, horrible daughters are really cartoons or caricatures, and some of the older characters are stereotypical. A few clich&eacute;s of boxing cinema poke out at you. There are tear-jerking moments as well.<br /> But despite its shortcomings, the film is a testament to the durability of family relationships, mother and son, and especially brother and brother.<br /> When Micky gets a strong-willed girlfriend, Charlene, (Amy Adams) who starts looking out for his interests, the family goes on high alert, but Charlene can give back as much as she gets. There's even a physical female brawl in one \\"comic\\" scene. Jack McGree is excellent as Alice's long-suffering husband.<br /> The dynamics of that family are going to get under your skin, and you're going to be entranced by the seven cronettes.<br /> Micky has to break from his brother when Dicky goes to prison, but the pull of the family is very strong in him. Charlene can't believe that such a bludgeoning family could ever help him, but Micky is a kid brother who has learned how to survive and thrive in such a brood.<br /> It's a motion picture that will command your attention beyond the ring scenes, good as they are, but by the way a family tugs, manipulates, loves, and persists perhaps because it is a force of nature.o get under your skin, and you're going to be entranced by the seven cronettes.

B0042JTDXK|2.0|My wife is a Josh Groban fan.  I purchased this CD for her as a Christmas gift believing that she would be pleased.  Sadly, she was very disappointed.  The work on this CD is, in our opinion, dull and somewhat lifeless.  When we first placed it in the player we anticipated great things.  The initial piece was just \\"OK\\", and things didn't get any better as the selections progressed.  With each selection we said; \\"Well, maybe the next one will be good\\".  By the end of the last track we understood that nothing on it was truly worth the price of the CD.<br />We wondered aloud, asking what happened to the Josh Groban work we were so pleased with in his initial entertainment offerings.  Now we're wondering if we should simply keep the few CD's of his that we still enjoy, toss those that we find disappointing and forget about purchasing any of his future work.
B003YY7BTW|1.0|This is the most unbelievable, poorly acted, terribly written, god-awful excuse for a movie EVER. Total waste of 2 hours.  This movie has enough plot and quality acting for a 30 second pampers commercial spot.  0/5 stars.

I didn't know what to expect from the Blu-Ray transfer but I was pleasently surprised and the movie looks like it was only recently released rather than its actual 2006 release. It's just a better product now.<br /><br />As for the movie, it is seriously creepy! If you're going to show the \\"freaks' they better be freaky as hell right? Well. They were, and they were all real! Those creatures were real people in costumes doin their thang! Watch those special features folks. There can be some good stuff there!
B001EC3JME|5.0|I work in construction and wanted a holster for my flashlight that was adjustable to accept my Minimag AA flashlight, modified with led and tail clicker switch, as well as a cree led one that has a larger barrel.  This holster accepts both and will also take my 3D Minimag if required.  An added bonus is that the holster allows access to the tail switch since it is open on both ends.  The rotating belt clip came in handy the other day when the job lost power and we were in pitch darkness in the early morning, but I could turn on the flashlight, rotate the holster, to walk hands free around the job.  I would recommend this holster to anyone.
014017821X|4.0|I'll admit that I was a somewhat reluctant reader of The Bloody Chamber. I'd purchased it for a class and then ended up not needing to read it. I have a strange personal tradition, though, of reading one piece of horror fiction at Christmas time (a tradition that began in junior high when I happened to read J. Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla--a vampire tale that Carter references in The Bloody Chamber), and when this was what I had on the shelf come Christmas-time, I gave it a go.     I'll admit, too, that I was a little ambivalent about it when I began the first couple of stories. The stories tend to follow a pattern of opening with a long flood of elaborate, creepy descriptions before finally moving on to the story, and the language throughout the collection is not difficult, but is allusive, sometimes tortuous, and always ornate. It all, to be honest, felt overwritten.     But at the same time, after slogging through the opening of the first couple stories, I would reach the ending to find that the story opened up and culminated in something that was just startling. I won't give away any endings, but many of them, such as \\"The Werewolf\\" and \\"The Tiger's Bride,\\" leave you with images that shock your intellect, and linger. And some of them, such as \\"The Bloody Chamber\\" and \\"The Courtship of Mr Lyon,\\" end just beautifully. \\"The Bloody Chamber,\\" especially, ends thrillingly, with the women of the story rejecting the passive roles typically assigned to them in fairy tales (this one based on Blue Beard) and washing the story in a beautiful bath of blood, in the process reshaping and reconstituting their community.     By the end of the book, Carter had totally won me over, and The Bloody Chamber's aspects that had seemed overwritten, instead, felt right. It felt like Carter had word-by-word constructed a concrete aesthetic world, an enormous gothic mansion complete with more than a few torture chambers and plenty of hidden passages still there to be explored. The Bloody Chamber was a fantastic book that I expect to enjoy even more on future readings.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|This film handled the Blu-ray transfer beautifully -- not surprising since it's an animated film. All the bonus materials are sweet and I highly recommend buying this on blu-ray. It will last so much longer and is worth the price. It's also one of the cheapest Disney blu-rays right now.    The textures pop off the screen and look even better than I remember them from the in-theater screening. I would highly recommend this!
B0049VQZUA|5.0|I have been reading \\"The Walking Dead\\" for 3 years now. This show is actually based off the Graphic Novel, written by Robert Kirkman, which you can find here on Amazon and any book store out there that stock graphic novels.    The show truelly brings justice to the comic in every way, from the direction, to the acting, everything is spot on. I really hope people take the time to watch, and/or, read the graphic novel. This is more than a \\"zombie popcorn flick\\" you would normally expect from hollywood. Infact, to my understanding, other than maybe resident evil, and 28 days later, this story actually takes the zombie thing seriously.   This story will bring out your human emotions. Through seeing loved ones turned to zombies, to making friends who you may have to kill later, even sometimes seeing the young forced to grow up fast and forced to kill other zombies or maybe those who are not infected, but pose a threat to thier family. The Walking Dead, is just simply an amazing adventure of human survival, told through the eyes of an author who decided to make a realistic, and sensible approach, towards something we've laughed and joked about for over 30 years. Where as before, zombie storys were left for the teens, and only seen as junk food for the brain, this time around, its as serious as a heart attack, atleast, in this story it is =D.   So, do yourself a favor, and check this story out, in either print or film.  [[ASIN:1607060760 The Walking Dead:  Compendium One]]

When you read the book, you feel like she actually got to sit down and know the poet or his family and friends that inspired each song.

0553805371|2.0|This books starts with some interesting questions and promise to answer them.  It then turns into a below average review of physics. The second half of this  book is quite repetitive and the end is rather desperate. The authors tried some  dull humor. Overall, this book strengthened my impression that modern physics  essentially stalled in progress over the past few decades and became a speculative  rather than quantitative field. I am curious how this happened, following rather   spectacular progress over the first 50 years of the 20th century. I did not find   that it  is worth spending 33$ and time to read it. I cannot recommend this book.

B001UV4XWY|1.0|This movie was NOT AT ALL what I expected. From the trailer I expected an action-packed movie. But no, instead I get an extremely offsetting movie that made me wish I could fast forward to an ending that would make it all worth while. However, once I got to the end, I was left with this: W-T-F. Seriously. That was the only thought on my mind. This movie didn't make sense to me, and it isn't worth watching again to understand further. I personally hated this movie. I feel that the plot was ultimately pointless.     Would I have pressed the button? Maybe, if I were 5. But as an American who grew up in a Christian home, I'm familiar with the old story of Adam and Eve. Forbidden apple anyone? No thanks. Even if I wasn't, I'm also familiar with Pandora's Box. You know, the box that the woman wasn't supposed to open, but one day she just HAD to. At least it took her longer than 24 hours to cave. Well over 24 hours. I know the consequences of my actions. I know I would not press the button, especially in 24 hours. There might have been a struggle if I was forced to have the box in my home until I died. THEN, I probably would struggle with not pressing it since I would have years of convincing myself into doing it.    Honestly, I don't think most people would risk killing someone, in the course of 24 hours when they are not put into a life threatening situation like Saw victims, a kidnapping, etc. I just don't buy any of it. Thank GOD I didn't buy this movie! Fortunately for me, it came on HBO.    Watch it for free, if you HAVE to. But I would pass on this movie all together. There's better things to do with your time. Seriously. Read a book. Watch a better movie. Fly a kite. Seriously. Anything is better than this movie.      Edit: I wrote this immediately after viewing it. I do have to add that the rating system is on how much the VIEWER enjoyed the movie. As always, there is an audience for this movie, I just don't think it's a large audience. If you enjoy mystery & scifi then you MIGHT enjoy this movie. I like mysteries & sci fi movies, but I was not a fan of this movie. I feel like the point of this movie ****SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE ON OUT, DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED************************** I feel that the whole point of this entire movie was to dish out ONE line to the viewers, and one line only. Well, technically several lines, but you get what I mean.  That line is this: \\"Your home is a box. Your car is a box on wheels. You drive to work in it and you drive home in it. You sit at home staring at a box. It erodes your soul while the box that is your body inevitably withers then dies whereupon it is placed in the ultimate box to slowly decompose.\\"      It's a very true and powerful quote. But it can also be meaningless. You can choose to be pessimistic, optimistic, or indifferent about life while being a realist. No choice is wrong, or right. I mention this because I feel that pessimistic people would enjoy this movie more so than others because of the similarity in viewpoints. But many others will feel cheated of their time at the end of this movie. Why? Because a movie with a \\"life sucks\\" mood isn't worth watching, unless it gives a suggestion on how to make life \\"suck\\" less.

0307474275|5.0|The Da Vinci Code has long been a very controversial book. People have debated the validity behind many of \\"facts\\" presented. The truth is that this novel is fiction, as clearly stated in the beginning of the book. There may be some truth behind it. Either way, it's still written extremely well. Dan Brown uses perfect pacing. He also presents many fascinating details, including tons of info about Jesus Christ, Mary Magdelene, Opus Dei, the pentacle and various other significant symbols in history, such as the rose. I certainly learned a lot by reading this novel. Although, you may choose to believe it, or not.<br />Once I started reading, I simply could not put it down. This was a true page-turner, as it was very well developed, and structured as a novel. At some point we just, have to forget all of the controversy, and just try and enjoy the book for itself. If you can do this, then you will surely love this book, as Brown has truly created an excellent piece of work, which will continue to live on for a very long time.
B004529NKC|4.0|When the dancing is this electrifying, it's much easier to overlook the not exactly groundbreaking plot. I saw the movie trailer months ago and it was misleading in places. Sharni Vinson (who plays \\"Natalie\\") looks close enough to Briana Evigan from STEP UP 2 that I got tricked some. It ultimately didn't matter. The other thing you won't get from viewing the trailer is that the story isn't just about the two hot leads Sharni Vinson and Rick Malambri. The very likable, charmingly awkward Adam G. Sevani makes a welcome return as Moose, and this is just as much his story. Moose now attends NYU, majoring in engineering, his dance life very much in his rear view mirror. Except that last bit doesn't even last past his first day of college.<br /><br />Moose inadvertently gets tangled up in a dance battle with a member of the House of Samurai... and beats the guy (the balloons may have been overdoing it). The police get caught up in the drama; Moose runs away from the cops, gets hooked up by a budding filmmaker named Luke (Malambri). Luke is one of them good dudes. He's barely hanging on to a warehouse which serves as a home and dance studio for a tight-knit crew of street dancers calling itself the House of Pirates. Luke is five months late on the warehouse payments. Even the warehouse's subbing as a night club isn't making ends meet. The one hope is for the Pirates to compete - and win - in the first ever annual World Jam, the prize money being $100,000. Luke recruits Moose. Luke also recruits Natalie (Sharni Vinson), this mysterious hot chick, because what's a movie without gorgeous dames causing trouble?<br /><br />That's the plot, and it's predictable. But go with it. It's a platform for the phenomenal dance routines, which is what we came to see in a dance flick, anyway, right? Dramatically, really, only Adam G. Sevani and Alyson Stoner (\\"Camille\\") come thru. Compared to the trifling, by-the-numbers stuff the two sexies, Vinson and Malambri, bring to the table, Sevani and Stoner's relationship feels more organic. You guys may remember Alyson Stoner as that standout kid featured in those Missy Elliott videos (Work It\\" and \\"Gossip Folks\\"). I wish she'd busted more moves here.<br /><br />Some of the world's best street dancers gather. And unlike another sorta similarly-themed movie I just saw (FAME remake), STEP UP 3 sizzles with dynamic energy and flair and passion and sheer showstopping stuff. These kids got moxie busting out their ears. The Santiago twins are a hoot. Moose has got skills for a gawky kid. And Chadd Smith is amazing. In his cool shades, dude is like the Terminator if the Terminator made a hobby of doing the Robot. That sick neck drop he does (Moose does it too) in the finals had me out of my seat yelling \\"What the f-!\\" But the film stretches beyond the pop & lock and the breakdancing, the krumping and the capoeira influences. Vinson and Malambri perform a sensual tango to Jazmine Sullivan's \\"Bust Your Windows.\\" And in one of the film's sweetest moments, Sevani and Stoner pay homage to the really old school, as they dance in the streets while that ice cream truck plays Fred Astaire's \\"I Won't Dance.\\"<br /><br />And if you liked STEP UP 2: THE STREETS, then there's really one cool surprise in store.<br /><br />In the finals, I loved the \\"Here come the Pirate shorties!\\" bit. But the LED costumes, I thought, were a bit much. The Pirates shouldn't have needed props. Their skills alone were enough to go to battle with. The Pirates were - to quote Luke - \\"born from a boombox.\\"and Stoner's relationship feels more organic.

And unlike another sorta similarly-themed movie I just saw (FAME remake), STEP UP 3 sizzles with dynamic energy and flair and passion and sheer showstopping stuff. These kids got moxie busting out their ears. The Santiago twins are a hoot. Moose has got skills for a gawky kid. And Chadd Smith is amazing. In his cool shades, dude is like the Terminator if the Terminator made a hobby of doing the Robot. That sick neck drop he does (Moose does it too) in the finals had me out of my seat yelling \\"What the f-!\\" But the film stretches beyond the pop & lock and the breakdancing, the krumping and the capoeira influences. Vinson and Malambri perform a sensual tango to Jazmine Sullivan's \\"Bust Your Windows.\\" And in one of the film's sweetest moments, Sevani and Stoner pay homage to the really old school, as they dance in the streets while that ice cream truck plays Fred Astaire's \\"I Won't Dance.\\"<br /><br />And if you liked STEP UP 2: THE STREETS, then there's really one cool surprise in store.<br /><br />In the finals, I loved the \\"Here come the Pirate shorties!\\" bit. But the LED costumes, I thought, were a bit much. The Pirates shouldn't have needed props. Their skills alone were enough to go to battle with. The Pirates were - to quote Luke - \\"born from a boombox.\\"
B00008OWZC|5.0|I was stuck in an RV with a few family member on a trip around the West from LA to Colorado and back again with plenty of stops in between.  In the back, unable to drive and out of books to read, all I had was a spotty CD player and a cousin to talk to.  On one of our first stops, I picked up this CD set.  I knew who Zeppelin was, but I had never sat down to actually listen to them before, and considering the price I didn't have much to lose and a lot of music to gain.  By track four I was an addict for life.  Something about how Plant wails in concert, the way Jimmy electrifies more for a crowd, how Bonham becomes an animal on the drums. Something about the mix of hearing a roaring crowd and being swept away by the music made it all so addictive.  That was eight years ago and this album set still has a permanent fixture in every road CD-case I've owned since.  For new and old, for the avid fan or the casual, this album is Zeppelin at their best.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|I saw this at the movies when it came out.  There was a grin on my face the entire movie.  I thought the actors did a perfect job with the voices, and the director(s) did a great job capturing the spirit of a children's book.  I loved the overall quirkiness of the dialogue and animation and thought it was a very ORIGINAL work - definitely not the same old animated film you've seen 100 times.  I know these stop motion films are a labor of love and very difficult to make, but I hope these people make more films in the future.  BRAVO     p.s. It looks GREAT in blu-ray
B003YOZNBU|4.0|I saw this film at the movies and really liked it and was surprised when it got such bad reviews.  I found it an adventure with great special effects and almost constant mayhem.  This movie was off-beat and unusual and had things in it I had not seen before in other films. And I like it when things blow up and this had a lot of that type of violence. Jonah is a real bad guy to be such a good guy and I enjoyed watching the charter development. This film will clearly not win any awards and it is not for younger kids, but if you like roaring, violent, action packed adventure adding this to your film collection would be a good idea.

B003VFEROQ|4.0|War Child has released a number of charity albums over the years, including the excellent \\"Heroes\\" compilation, released in early 2009, and the equally delightful \\"Help: A Day in the Life\\" compilation from 2005, just to name a few. Now comes the next War Child charity compilation.<br /><br />\\"We Were So Turned On: A Tribute to David Bowie\\" (2 CDs; 32 tracks; 140 min.) is, as the album title indicates, an all-covers David Bowie album. Unlike in the past War Child compilation, the majority of artists on this album are completely unknown (to me anyway). Indeed, only a handful of 'big' names on here: Duran Duran brings an excellent interpretation of \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\" (which is actually better than the original, but that's just me); Warpaint brings \\"Ashes to Ashes\\"; Chairlift brings an outstanding \\"Always Crashing in the Same Car\\" (the best track on the entire album for me); A Place to Bury Strangers blows up \\"Suffragette City\\". All of these appear on CD1, which I rate 4.5 stars. A couple of songs into CD2, which brings mostly unfamiliar artists, and I'm beginning to get Bowie-fatigue. 2 hrs. 20 min. is a LOT of music to digest. But there are still a couple of nice nuggets, such as Lights' \\"World Falls Down\\" and Caroline Weeks' \\"Starman\\". CD2 gets 3.5 stars.<br /><br />It should be quite clear how to turn this massive collection into a manageable, and stronger, album, namely pare it down to the best 13-14 tracks. But it's a minor quibble. The proceeds of this album go towards a great cause, and that in and of itself should be good enough to convince you to check this out.
B0032O6S4I|5.0|I just finished assembling this toy for my five year old for Christmas and I can't WAIT for her to see it!!  As impressive as, if not more so, our other Playmobil items.  (We have the farm, the plane, the ambulance, a fairy castle thing, and numerous add-ons.)  The details are fantastic as always, making this a great toy with which to grow.  The animals are gorgeous.  The whole layout is terrific.  I have no doubt this toy will be the highlight of our Christmas morning.     FYI, it took about 90 minutes to put together.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I totally loved this series.  The acting was good and had a very great story line.  It was entertaining and kept my attention to the end.  I cannot wait for season 2.

030746363X|3.0|I read through the book and found some of the information new and interesting. I also found a bit of it to be not some useful and pretty much included just for hypes sake. That being said I am down 8 pounds in the first week following the diet and training schedule after being stuck at a plateau for months.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love post apocalyptic books and this book didn't disappoint. 1984 is still my favorite but this is in the top 10.
B000L43AN4|1.0|I feel that these songs are simply not musical enough. Raw and real yes, but that's the best I can say about it.
B00483ATL0|5.0|Great CD from a great Italian singer. All of his cd's are great, but this is a good start if your interested in getting to know his music. No bad songs. Highly recomend this cd. Buy it.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|An outstanding seasonal/Christmas musical accompaniment. Rarely absent from my CD changer. I particularly love its variety -- of selections, styles and interpretations.
014241543X|5.0|I usually only read paranormal but I am so glad that I read this.  The fact that Mia plays the cello makes it refreshing.  The understanding of Mia's parents is wonderful.  I don't think this book will disappoint anyone.
1591843162|5.0|Very good service. This book is awesome. Everyone needs to read it. As a small business owner, ( [...] )I think it this information is invaluable for all. get the book. Lionel Wilson
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|I enjoyed this movie from begining to end.  Usually I fall assleep while watching an animated movie.  I was awake for the entire move.
0062502182|5.0|The book was priced very cheaply. Decent used condition as described. I'm satisfied with the purchase and would definitely buy other products from this seller
B0044KU7KU|4.0|This album is pretty different from their previous ones, and it had to grow on me at first, but I've really enjoyed it.  A lot of it sounds a lot like dance music, which is not their usual style, but I like it.  My favourite songs are \\"Bulletproof Heart\\" and \\"Only Hope for Me Is You.\\"  I'm so glad they finally released another album, and I'm quite pleased with how it turned out.
0345350499|4.0|The Mists of Avalon, as you've likely guessed, is a retake on the King Arthur legends, but what makes it different is that it's written from the women's perspectives (Morgaine, Guinevere, etc.). The first one was written by Marion Zimmer Bradley in 1983 and this was the first time this feminist technique was used in fantasy literature and it was very successful (I learned that when I took a Modern Scholar course in fantasy literature).<br /><br />The Mists of Avalon is beautifully written, but slow-paced, and I often wished the story would move faster. Since the women characters are the focus, there's not much action (except traveling). The chicks themselves aren't fighting a lot of Saxons. Also, there's a major emphasis on the dissolution of the pagan religion as Christianity spread throughout England. This was really interesting, but since the main character, Morgaine, is a pagan priestess, the views expressed on this topic are definitely anti-Christian. In fact, the reader gets the impression that Marion Zimmer Bradley is really pushing pagan and feminist agendas.<br /><br />This is not your typical everything's-okay-at-the-end fantasy because it's based on the King Arthur legend (in which everything doesn't turn out okay). Therefore, it's a bit depressing. But, The Mists of Avalon is a classic, so you should read it, especially if you're an adult woman. I think women will like this series better than men will. I'll also mention that I have heard critics refer to this as a book for old and young, but I think the focus on the weird love rectangle(?) between Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, and Morgaine, makes this inappropriate for the kids. If they want to read about Arthur, send them elsewhere -- where there's less sex and more Saxons.
B00006L9ZT|3.0|I agree with the many reviewers here who have praised the conducting, the orchestra, and the singers, and I also agree that if you want a so-called traditional production, this is the one to get.  The acting isn't always very dynamic, but I've certainly seen worse in other opera DVDs, and I don't agree with those who complain that the production is boring or too unimaginative. It's traditional, but it's not boring.      My problem with this set is that the video quality is substandard when viewed on an HDTV.  The production dates from the late 1980s, and the DVD was issued in 1990.  It was not shot in widescreen, which isn't a big problem in and of itself, but the image is very fuzzy and lacks depth and clarity, even when viewed with a Blu-Ray player that upscales the DVD image.  This becomes especially apparent during scenes that are dark (and in the Ring, this includes a lot of scenes).  It looks like an early VHS tape.  I never really noticed a problem when viewing it on my CRT 4:3 TV, but I certainly do on my HDTV.  I hope that this will be cleaned up as much as possible and given a new video transfer on Blu-Ray.  It's in desperate need of a remastering.    Another problem with the video is that the subtitles are much larger than they need to be, and they intrude on the already murky image.  This is something that could easily be fixed in a remastered version.    The audio, especially the DTS track, is quite good, which only makes the video look all the more outdated. My DVD set has several audio dropouts (at least on the DTS track), but there aren't many and they only last a second or two.  I bought this set when it was first issued, and the dropouts may have been resolved with subsequent pressings.  Even though the DTS is very good, I'd like to hear what they could do if they upgraded it to one of the newer HD audio formats available on Blu-Ray     So, 5 stars for the performances and staging, 2 points for the video, 4 points for the audio, and an overall score of 3 stars.  I hope that DG will remaster this classic performance and give it the video quality that it deserves.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I was very pleased with my timely delivery and good condition of my order.  I will be ordering again.
B002ZG9940|1.0|This movie was a huge disappointment. They made the trailer look like an action movie (I was picturing something like the Bourne movies) and it was nothing like that. It was very slow and boring. Nothing much happened in the entire movie and there was no point at all. Most of the movie was Clooney driving around and shots of him looking into the mirror.<br /><br />Bottom line...not worth your time or money.
0767834739|1.0|I failed to try and watch it within my 30 days and am now stuck with a useless DVD. The back has too many scratches for my DVD player to even be able to read it. Right now I wonder who should replace it since it was never viewed. Even the special features DVD looks pretty cruddy on the back. The other DVDs from the same shipment all arrived fine. This was obviously bad before it shipped to me.    So I purchased a second one and darn if there isn't something screwy going on with some DVDs. The second one looks fine, but like my THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH dvd, it will not play in my regular DVD player. Somewhat of a fortunate bit of luck, I have a mobile player this second one will work in.    Do I now return the second one by shipping the first one back? I am still stuck with one that was damaged when it was created and one that won't play in a normal DVD player.
B004AP09CU|5.0|I can certainly understand the gripes about the price, but this is the fully remastered version of one of Bruce's best albums. It is well worth the price. Rich and full sound, distinct on each instrument. Thumbs way up!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|We had seen this movie and wanted to purchase it as a Christmas gift for a grandchild who loves animals.  The movie is based on a true story and was very well done.  Although she hasn't opened this gift yet, we are sure that it will be a favorite.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I enjoyed this movie because I have a grandson that is the same as the football player.  Big, but doesn't want to hurt anyone else.
B003ES61EE|5.0|This cleaning brush for lenses and other delicate surfaces is designed in a compact way, with a fine retractable brush on one end and a polisher/buffer on the other.  I've been cleaning a lot of surfaces today, and this device does a fine job; I even tried it on my ipad and it worked like a charm.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|If you like blues rock and haven't seen this concert, you are missing out! This is one of the all time top produced concerts I have ever seen. You will not be disappointed! Joe Bonamassa will go down with the greatest guitar players of all time. Highly recommended!
B0041KKYEM|3.0|darren aronovsky seems to be aiming for the grandest dreams of michael powell (the red shoes) but arrives at the most o.t.t cinema since ken russell.    he seems to think that if a shot can be made in your face, then it's good.   i haven't seen so many b-movie shock cuts since they took the friday night horror flick off the local affiliate.    and what's with casting only jewish actors, d?  (except for mila kunis, and maybe cassel).    and making all the women caricatures of faye dunaway in \\"mommie dearest?\\"   and...and...and... i know, i know, it'a all in the head of the psycho-lesbian heroine.   i saw \\"mulholland drive.\\"   but that was an intriguing film.       i knew michael powell.   michael powell was a pal of mine.   darren:  you're not michael powell.
B003ASLJO0|4.0|This is a great movie; a classic Eastwood film.  This film is well done, with excellent acting, and a very relevant storyline.
B0043IBWWA|2.0|Both my mother in law and I are very dissapointed in this book.  Not enough of Jamie's view as was described, too much like a comic book.  Not enough of the story, vague at best. Was expecting to see the next 'book' after Echo in the Bone not a partial showing of book one.
