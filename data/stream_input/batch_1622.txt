B007VUA7VO|5.0|i bought this app and im glad i did!!!!! Its great and its much easier to check this app then looking at the battery icon in the top corner! it also shows how much time you have left for things like you have 1 hour left to hear music or 20 minutes to watch videos and stuff!!!!! THIS IS A MANDATORY APP THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE!!!!!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I don't know what the last guy was talking about.I only play it on my kindle fire. best game ever. I love this game. it really surprised me what great minds at work can create. I love the way you can tap on the candy at the home menu and change it. I cant tell what it changes into. you have to buy it to find out.
B00992CF6W|3.0|j.geer what u have to do is update ur credit card to make it work ok try it ur welcome
B008MEM24S|5.0|awesome app. it really is cool.I love how you can use the inators to turn water into fire and ice.  ignore the comments that say that its a rip off I haven't had one problem with it. well worth the money. I play this all the time. for those of you who liked where's my water this is for you.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Hard to put down. Can have hours of fun. Addictive and runs great on my new Kindle Fire HD. would like to see more.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I bought this and I love it!!!!!!! it might seem expensive but if you love angry birds its for you. I bought my kindle fire just so I could play it. and it doesn't disappoint. all the old birds get a touch up. and the principles for gravity are broken;} its a must have
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Amazing little gem of music...who knew he had it in him. That is is Hugh Laurie makes you grin as you listen to it.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It stupit an usless. your beda off not evar triyn to rede it. i gif it zeero starss. it dumb n stupid.
B00881VLCE|4.0|i would like a larger variety of pictures to choose from. overall it is a fun way to pass some time
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This appears to have been a license for whatever version of the game you have. I installed it on my phone, and it removed ads from the existing version. On my tablet, which already had an ad-free different version, it did nothing. I really appreciate getting the ads off my phone, though.
B009329Y30|5.0|Zac Efron is amazing in his \\"grown up\\" roles. The story line is typical Nic Sparks, but it's believable. This plot could really happen and it has you rooting for love. Zac also gets to showcase a bit of his musical talent as well. I loved it and could watch it over and over again.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|First of all, I have been playing video games since the 80's with Nintendo's first console.  I haven't played Flo, or Flower yet, so I can't speak for them.  However, Journey is the most unique gaming experience that I've ever had.<br /><br />I first purchased this game off of the Playstation Network, and I had absolutely no idea what I was in for.  The basic idea of the game, is a kind of meditative pilgrimage if you will.  You do meet other players on your journey, but only one at a time.  You are not shown their gamer tags (except at the very end of the game), you do not communicate with them in game, other than a kind of musical chirp.  This experience allows you, the payer, do develop an emotional bond with a compete stranger.  It's the idea that, we're all in this together.<br /><br />The artwork is beautiful, and the gameplay itself is very immersive.<br /><br />The soundtrack is a very special part of the experience as well.  The music in the game, is many times determined by the players actions (sort of), and extremely appropriate to the visuals. The orchestrated music itself is...  breathtaking.<br /><br />One word of note.  The game itself is very short.  Top to bottom, it can be finished in just under 2 hours.  This is by no means a drawback.  In fact, it's a stroke of brilliance.  Having the game be so short, will allow the individual to destress after a very intense day.<br /><br />I highly recommend playing this in a darkened room, lights off, phone turned off, and no distractions.  A wonderful experience altogether!
B005H2IAM6|3.0|its a nice movie, it tries to copy Battlestar Galactica! has nice effects! its a little funny to watch a japanise movie! story its a little boring, I wouldn but it, I would prefer to rent it.. cheers.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I preordered this book with much anticipation and burned through it as soon as it arrived.  Compared to other SEAL-themed books (Lone Survivor, Fearless, Service, SEAL Target Geronimo, etc.), I found it to have more humor (dry) and in my opinion it did not reveal anything that seemed like classified information (admittedly I am not an expert).  The author's account of the raid itself was captivating and the \\"business as usual\\" demeanor of these professionals is highly admirable.  I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in the raid, DEVGRU or a glimpse into the comical \\"banter\\" that flows between these operators, even amid incredibly stressful scenarios.  If you're looking for classified tactical information or controversy, this book will probably disappoint you.  It's an easy to read, enjoyable, well-told story from the perspective one of the brave men involved.  I just hope he had the legal right to write it.
B0087HT36U|1.0|Like a lot of other reviews, I am unable to even run the game.  Not worth a purchase until this is fixed.
B0087HT36U|5.0|A fun and challenging. Those angry birds should be angry at the competition this game provides. Everyone that likes the birds will love this one!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I have noticed this on all story games but this one is the worst. I come into my game and it says I earned over a thousand coins and a lot of the food will be gone but when I go to cook more food or buy something all pf a sudden I go from 1000 coins to 36 coins. this makes it extremely hard to progress throught the game because it barely gibes you any coins even after you earned them. another thing is that when someone tips you it often doesn't give you all 20 coins like it says it does. it is also hard to get diamonds but I expect that. this coin problem is the reason I docked the game 2 stars because without coins or food you cant progress. thrpight the game. the rest though is fun like decorating and visiting and doing all else in the game that doesn't involve money. if team lava fixes this problem I would definatly give the game a 5 star review but I can barely play it in the first place.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This book is simply perfect. I enjoyed every single page and couldn't put it down until finished. On the other hand it was really difficult to read the footnotes in kindle
B008XG1X18|4.0|except for 15min fails...absolutely love Pinterest on my Kindle firema. When I get time to browse the vast field of creativity &hellip;I get really into all the great stuff...and then it happens. The Pinterest app needs to close. except for every15 min fails, only on my Kindle Fire, not on my mobile, things are good. However, this app can easily get 5 stars in updated review later...when the issue gets fixed.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I was very excited when the book was finally released. It was probably the slowest start to one of Jack Reachers adventures. I started to predict what was going to happen before I read it. It is probably the only book of this series where Reacher doesnt get laid!!! which might mean he is becoming human like the rest of us.<br />However the read was enjoyable and it is time to move on to another author/character.<br />I hate to say it but the character Reacher is becoming too predictable. I have read every one of Lee Childs books on the Reacher series and would recommend them anybody who likes a good honest hreo and a bloody good read.<br /><br />A bit of an anti-climax to this book as it became apparent at the actual conclusion.<br />The shoot-out at the end is a bit messy and confusing but well worth the wait
B0077EBWVI|5.0|This movie was freakin' amazing!! I watched the '84 version too, but I liked the remix better. This one is more modern, more relatable.
B00932A2MC|4.0|Actually a pretty dumb movie, but my intention was to be entertained by the movie, not to take away a deeper meaning of life.  I mean really, to see a WWII battleship going full guns has to be worth something!
B008GOG98Y|4.0|I watched this when I was about 9 years old.  I found it on Amazon and introduced it to my 9 year old.  We both really enjoyed it (and love biking).  It was great to pass this great movie down to another generation.
B005HSL626|1.0|Was going to be my new addiction but keeps knocking me out of my game! Do not want to uninstall please fix!
B0029LHWL8|3.0|The first half of the book, about a young man growing up in Pondicherry, was superb.  Wonderful, evocative, lovingly detailed, fun, thoughtful, educational.<br /><br />The second half of the book was pretty good.  A detailed story of survival.<br /><br />But at the end, the author piles on too many absurdities, to the degree of being insulting to the reader's intelligence.  It is almost as if he is scoffing at us for having suspended disbelief up to this point.<br /><br />I'm glad to have read this book...but the ending was terrible.
B006C3Q6GG|4.0|I was given this book s a gift but kept putting it off until July when all the books dropped more than 50% in price each. I took my chances and bought all the books at the reduced price. Some were given as bday gifts.<br /><br />I started reading this one the first chance I got and quickly started enjoying the book. Took some time to get used to the style and some parts were a little dragging but good nonetheless. I am very glad to have goten these books and saving myself so much money.<br /><br />Aubrey gets promoted to captain of the Sophie. Maturin becomes the doctor of said ship. They first meet in a concert and not to a good start. But that quickly changes.  Can't wait to see what else happens in their journeys.<br /><br />I would definitely get one book first to see if you enjoy it because I'm sure it's not for everyone. For those who do like it it will be an enjoyable ride.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is such a lovely book from a lovely new author.  It's so skillfully written it's hard to believe it's her first book.  She takes a character who has lived through things most of us can't imagine, and makes her eminently relatable.  The \\"voice\\" of the story-telling is compassion and honest.  I was just sad when the book ended as I wanted to keep reading!
B003B02O7I|4.0|The story kicks off from the beginning when Phelan jumps to his death just hours after rewriting his will. As all the heirs await the will being rear they start spending cash like crasy only to find out some hard lessons about life. The story then takes a different route to Brazil to find the one illegitimate heir who wants to part in this court business as the thee battle heats up. Won't say much more but definitely worth picking up.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this is an exciting version of angry birds in that it puts you on the pointing end of the slingshot. round after round of ammo is hurled into a fort to bring it down. really cool!!!
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|It was different than what I remembered. I first read it in the sixth grade and really enjoyed it and then saw Tom and Huck from Disney and also good. My last impression was that of the movie that when I came back years later (16 years later) to finally re-read this classic I found many things missing. Of course I had the movie implanted in my memory more than the book itself. Nonetheless it did not take away from the book, if anything it enhanced it as it allowed me to revisit Tom's world. Enjoyable book but one that does not be revisited as often. Will still recommend of course.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest and the app works fine on my kindle.  I enjoy looking at various &quot;pins&quot; to find great ideas for home, family, church and school.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Won't download!!!! WTF?! Seriously? Worked great when I first got it but now it sucks and won't download ANYTHING! Soooooo angry! Had a blast when I first had it but it is a total waste of time and effort. Complete and utter bullsh!t.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Game is like Angry Birds, but your shooting head on at the structure/enemies.  Issues can happen whereban object hangs on in mid air.  Spent 3 hours playing it.  Game has alot of potential.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Although the movie was just a little too long, the story was good and so was the action.<br />Kristen Stewart, although attractive, kisses like she's in kindergarten - Not that I ever remember girls kissing when I was in kindergarten? Yuck!<br />Chris Hemsworth, on the other hand, got my girlfriend all worked up without his Thor hammer and uniform.  What can I say?  It worked out for me after the show!<br />Charlize Theron was so convincing in her role as the evil queen that I wished I could find my ex-wife, just so I could spit in her eye.  So many scary resemblences (it gave me shivers).<br />I thought that it was unusual that the studios chose not to use real dwarves for the seven, but instead CG enhanced (shortened) actors.  Like Bob Hoskins. But hey, he's pretty close to being a dwarf without the ism, when he's not playing a Smee.<br />I think you'll find that this movie is a good modern and adult version of the classic that we all enjoyed when we were children in the sixties and seventies.<br />I recommend it.  Oh yeah, my girlfriend recommends it too!
030788743X|5.0|This is easily the best book I have read since the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy.  I could not put it down.
B008Y6WPXC|4.0|Okay. So, I clubbed my girlfriend over the head and drug her by the hair into my man cave, and we both watched some of my favorite one-liner stars blow shtuff up.<br />All I can say is grab your girl and drag her to your man cave, and she'll discover a whole new kind of chick flick.  One where she can view sweaty muscle.  You'd be surprised to learn how your girl appreciates (and rewards) the occasional dose of testosterone.<br />Don't forget the good action!  Oh, and did I mention a lot of cool explosions and gunfire.<br />The bad guys never stood a chance.<br />I recommend this movie to rattle your cave walls.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I never gave much thought to anti virus software on an Android.  Finally decoded to be safe than sorry and since I use avast on my computers, I picked it for my Fire.  The thing I like most about it is that it keeps out of the way, doesn't sick battery life and warns me when I'm doing something dangerous.  That's all I want.  A little buddy who's got my back when I need him and doesn't get on the way.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it<br /><br />lots of fun and fast paced. fun to play!<br />you should get this game. love the fashion game too.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Like many Reacher fans, I've read almost every Reacher book and because I only started last year, I did it all in a few months (very addicting). I was waiting for this book and here's how I feel about it having finished reading it 10 minutes ago:<br /><br />At this point, I feel like Jack Reacher is a personal friend whose company and adventures I enjoy. I like his personality, I like his morals and I laugh pretty loudly at his sarcasm (lots of belly laughs from 'A Wanted Man' for me - esp the reference to an ABP and a fetus). Reading 'A Wanted Man' is like taking a road trip with a buddy. It ain't Vegas, it's not a bachelor party. Muted fun. Cozy, cool and relaxed.<br />If you're expecting something more like 'Bad Luck & Trouble' (one of my favorites - the one where his old crew gets together like the A-Team to avenge their murdered buddy), you can skip this one. However, if you just want to toil around with Reacher, this is good.<br /><br />I understand why people are so disappointed. I don't disagree that this was a little light on the action and brutal beat downs. On the other hand, I was glad to see Reacher finally breaking some old and very tired habits. Like bedding the main female protagonist, drinking coffee every third page (Reacher's coffee breath must be unbearable!) and crunching on gravel every 10th page. There was 'Tripwire' (also very good) where he gave up coffee for mineral water, that was kinda cool. So what is Jack Reacher into these days? McDonalds (Cheeseburgers and coffee? Gross.)!<br /><br />To sum up:<br />If you want to start reading Reacher novels, don't start here. You won't be impressed. If you've read all the Reacher novels and are OK with just chilling with the guy on a somwhat lazy detour laughing at his inner thoughts and his responses to idiots, then you'll have a good time. Not a blast, but you can't expect Vegas every time.<br /><br />And to Lee Child if you ever read this: Please bring Neagley back. I like her. She seems to add abit of special sauce whenever she pops up in Reacher's world. Don't you dare kill her either! Thank you.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Again. apparently  to post this review i must write 19 words. such a sham, 6 more words, 3 more, done.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app was purchased to compliment the one on my home computer. It works like a dream. I am able to check things out almost anywhere.The app works very well. Recommend this highly.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app! I have it on my kindle fire and i havent had the first problem. I wish we had the option to pin from the web but otherwise its great!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved these books!!  All three where very good reads!  I couldn't put them down. Read them all in about four days! Well worth ur time!!
0385344333|1.0|I LOVE the Jack Reacher books and audiobooks, but, this one has WAY TOO MANY PROBLEMS IN IT!!!.  For one thing, Jack Reacher goes through the whole book with a broken nose that he received in the \\"61 Hours\\" novel and his nose DOES NOT get fixed by the end of the book...Spoiler alert, if that is one of them.  The other problem with the book, is that Lee Child KEEPS REPEATING \\"Sin City\\".  I thought that Sin City referred to Las Vegas?.  It sounds like Sin City in this book, is a neighborhood or another part of town, other than Las Vegas and that kept distracting me, while I was reading and listening to the book.  The book started off with a bang and it was interesting for awhile and then it went from hot to cold and cold to hot.  I wish that Lee Child's would write MORE about Reacher's family, like, who his father was and STOP writing about terrorism.  I want to know MORE about Jack Reacher and his family.  This book was TOO BORING FOR ME and it left me feeling empty afterwards.  One last thing before I end this review, Tom Cruise IS THE WRONG CHOICE TO PLAY REACHER!!!.  I have said this before and I will say it again.  I WILL NOT GO SEE \\"Jack Reacher\\" the movie, when it comes out!!!.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game tons of fun. great way to pass some time and fun for all ages to play. challenging in so many ways.
B006LSZECO|1.0|k i have like no desire to read this book fro all the BAD ratings so someone JUST SAY WHAT happens at the end does he stop writing and why does everyone wanna take a shower when they finish reading it
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I'm not generally a fan of this \\"thriller\\" genre, but \\"Pines\\" is making me rethink that! This was the first book I got through the Kindle Owners Lending Library, and I'd say it was a great choice.<br /><br />I finished this book in about three and a half days (forced to take breaks from reading in order to go to work...), and that should describe just how much of a page tuner it is! I was right there with Ethan as he tried to figure out the mystery surrounding his life and this strange town of Wayward Pines. Why's he trapped? Are the townspeople oblivious or hiding something? Heck, is he awake or asleep?!<br /><br />Read this book as soon as you get the chance. The ending will knock your socks off because you'll have so many guesses as to what's going on and none of them will be right. If you enjoyed shows like Twin Peaks, The X-Files, Lost, or Twilight Zone, you'll enjoy \\"Pines.\\" Get it right now and don't look back.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Pretty much what you could expect from a board game.  An \\"ok\\", Hollywood fluff piece about aliens and a battleship, the Mighty Mo.  Interesting that only the old guys who actually sailed her knew anything about running her.  Kinda says something about modern warfare and the \\"pinball\\" fleets (or at least Hollywood's appraisal of them. \\"Ready to play with the big boys.\\")  Nice \\"popcorn on a rainy Saturday night when all TV is a rerun\\" kind of movie. Think Battlestar Galactica's pilot on the water.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Has a problem every now and then where it wont open but let it rest and you are ready to go. i love this app!
B0087HT36U|2.0|Kind of fun to play, but too many bugs. Often the game will not fire the rock when I prompt it to.  Frustrating.
B003Y5D776|5.0|At first, I thought it wasn't working. Couldn't get it to work on an Apple Mini. Turned out it was lack of knowledge on my part. I am used to hearing the microphone over the speakers as I use them as it does on all Windows computers. Turns out you can't hear your use of it, but it plays back just fine. Wonderful product.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I don't mind MOST of the changes Lucas made to this Blu ray set. Like all the fights w/ my girlfriend, I can no longer remember exactly what has been changed and when. However, Vader uttering \\"NOOOOOO\\" at the end of Jedi is simply stupid and unnecessary. I've predicted Lucas' barbaric capitalism in the past, and I feel he'll one day release a set W/OUT that mortal sin of a change (the \\"NOOOOO\\"). However, it's safe to say that we'll never have the versions we want. Ever.<br />That, as far as I'm concerned, is the true tragedy. More so than the over-bloated prequels, which I refuse to even comment on.
B0071DJZZA|1.0|I bought this book because some of my 40 something girlfriends were discussing it and how much they liked it and couldn't wait for the movie!<br />I am usually not a fan of this type of story, preferring thriller/crime/suspense.<br />I felt it was written with teenagers in mind, kind of like the recent Twilight series and Harry Potter.<br />I didn't enjoy the story as I felt I needed more of a description of what had gone before to arrive at the point of the story, it felt rushed.<br />I bought the Movie Tie In Edition by mistake and am not sure whether there is a different book, written differently.<br />Needless to say, I have not finished it and probably won't bother.
B006LSZECO|1.0|this is obviously a novel of current thinking and  addressed to an audience that is not traditional.  It is not even well written.  I read it for a book club and would not recommend it for anyone. It was a waste of time.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|i almost always read non fiction books but this story is addicting!  please read it....... you will thank me for it.
B006H5120E|5.0|I have been waiting for Titanic to be released on Blu-Ray at last its here!!....my last viewing of Titanic was over 12 months ago giving it a good rest. Well I've just purchased the Blu-Ray 3D combo pack and watched it last night on our big screen, 120 inch screen i.e. 3 meters across the bottom, using an EPSON TW2000 HD projector, WOW....again WOW, look at all those Stars!!!...now you can see them!!!, I'm in awe of this film, the Blu-Ray works, of course it works, the detail is outstanding, motion blur being the only let down but hey I know Cameron is working on that!<br /><br />The Alternative Ending is interesting to say the least but I'm quite happy with the original theatrical version.<br /><br />The next time I view Titanic will be the 3D Blu-Ray, say another 12 months, by then I'll have upgraded to a 3D Projector (TW8000) me thinks. I'll do a follow up report then.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game the people who don't like it areidiots the only don't like because they cant figure it out
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|As Conan the Barbarian (2011) begins, a baby is born on the battlefield, literally cut from his mother's womb as swords clash around them. The scene oozes delicious, delicious cheese, and if the rest of the movie had followed suit, this may very well have been a four or five star review (what? I like cheesy movies). Unfortunately, save for a few action highlights, things go downhill from there.<br /><br />The entirely unmotivated romance between Conan and his damsel-in-distress-of-the-week is a major problem with the movie. Jason Momoa as Conan has a kind of blunt charm to his character, but it is very rarely apparent in his interactions with Tamara, his love interest. Her attraction to him comes out of nowhere, and what little character development she had is lost as soon as she falls for Conan. She shows a few traces of personality towards the beginning and middle of the film, but by the time the final battle rolls around, she is reduced to screaming and being nobly willing to die to protect Conan. Cutting Tamara from the movie entirely would have fixed a number of the problems I had with it. (Another way to fix those problems, of course, would be to give her character development and a purpose. Somehow, I'm not holding out much hope.)<br /><br />The villainess Marique is a far more interesting character who also suffered from underdevelopment. Despite the fact that her motivation seems to be \\"daddy issues,\\" it's still far better than Tamara, who had no motivation at all. Her powers and appearance are intimidating and mysterious as well. Unfortunately, the writers seemed to run out of ideas for her, resulting in a lackluster final battle and death. Similarly, her father started off strong, with an interesting backstory that promised more than it actually delivered. In the final battle, he is reduced to a cackling and ineffectual villain who is dispatched in the most cliched possible way, with no real consequences for the protagonists.<br /><br />In fact, the entire second half of the film is only borderline watchable, though there are a few worthwhile scenes. Namely, Jason Momoa dual-wielding greatswords. In fact, I feel like the movie would have been vastly improved if 99.9% of it had consisted of Jason Momoa dual-wielding greatswords.<br /><br />Even with the reservations I've mentioned (and those I haven't), Conan the Barbarian was largely entertaining. The action is fun, the dynamic between Conan and Artus is convincing (and he lives! Although, admittedly, this is because he drops out of the plot entirely and is replaced by a somewhat whiny one-eyed thief who is not even present for the final battle), and the depiction of Conan's childhood is pretty good storytelling, though over far too soon. The first half of the movie is far better than the second, but the whole thing is watchable and reasonably fast-paced, so despite its two-hour runtime, you don't get the feeling you've wasted a large chunk of your life.<br /><br />If you enjoy riffing on movies or would like to watch some standard sword and sorcery fare, this movie is definitely rentable, but I wouldn't recommend it for a permanent space on your DVD shelf.

B0098VYKSA|2.0|Kristen Stewart has got to be one of the worst actresses of her generation.  When not drifting through the movie like a soulless zombie, her attempts at sincerity and passion are almost painful to watch.<br /><br />This may have been a good movie -- especially with powerful actors like Charlize Theron and Chris \\"Thor\\" Hemsworth, and employing top notch special effects -- but Kristen Stewart is just plain terrible.
B003HARV4S|5.0|I would classify this as one of the best suspense - romance movies I have ever watched.  The cast and settings were excellant.  The time frame made the movie more believeable.  I didn't want it to end but the wrap up was great.
030758836X|5.0|This book grabbed me from the beginning and, except for a brief section in the first third that got a little slow, kept my attention to the end.  The characters, although flawed and somewhat wacky, were well written and quite interesting.  Some of the sections, like dealing with Amy, the missing wife's childhood, reminded me of the inaccurate opinions that can be formed when we are looking at a person or family from the outside.  Other passages, like when Amy talks about first meeting and falling in love with her husband, were so well written that I marked the passages.<br /><br />I have recommended this to several people and like it so much I am back on Amazon buying another copy (I read it electronically and want a hard copy).  Very highly recommended.

B007NG93CK|3.0|I always enjoy Kathy Reichs books especially the forensic aspect of them although at times I found this one confusing and seemed to lose the thread at times.  It is enjoyable but perhaps not one of her best.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is fun. Yes, it waits for things to settle before moving on, but that is a minor inconvenience at best.
B0017I3U74|5.0|When I first saw Peggey Sue Got Married at the movie theatre, I really enjoyed it.  I have been looking for this movie for some time now.  Then I remembered Amazon, and to my surprise, there it was, waiting to be purchased.  It is a shame, in my opinion, that this movie is never seen on television.  I know if those television studios would just use there imagination and go to the vault, they would be amazed with all those wonderful movies from the 1980's that are just sitting around, waiting to be shown.  It would be refreshing to see, instead of all those repeated movies and marathons they keep showing.  I mean in my opinion I think it is time to take off the air \\"Angel\\" and show something new.  There are several old television programs from the 1970's that have not been shown for a long time.  Peggy Sue Got Married is to me a very neat and enjoyable movie.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|Loved the movie: thoughtful, well-written, and Daniel Radcliffe is very much not Harry Potter.<br /><br />I'm a fan of the multi-disc format, as there are times I want to be able to show a DVD as well as watch on blu-ray. This is one of the few movies that I feel is worth the investment of Blu-ray in my collection, vs. either just a DVD or (worse), an occasional Netflix view.<br /><br />4 starts rather than five, as I would have liked more behind-the-scenes detail on the Blu-Ray release.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|refined and challenging, great follow on the the original quell. clever puzzles and fun game play.  I think you'll like it
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a former sailor, RM2  ss I was highly interested in this story, so far I like the book but only have read the portion of the UBM killing.<br />Finished the rest of the book, it was a great read, anyone interested in military operations will enjoy!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is awesome. I'm on my third time playing it. I especially like the option of letters. its perfect for people like me who have trouble distinguishing some color shades. great app again. thanks big duck
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Lee Child and The Jack Reacher books is the only series that I buy on day one of it's release, without even reading the description. There was a time when a Reacher story was a guaranteed winner, worth the money everytime. It's sad for me as a  fan to admit but that is no longer the case. I can't even intelligently put into words what happened with this book. What went wrong? I haven't got a clue. This book was repetitive in a way not only uncharacteristic of an author with Lee Child's reputation but for any author. At times I wondered if he was trying to turn what should have been a short story into a full length novel, however I've seen that done in a manner less horrendous than this. I'm truly at a loss for an explanation as to how this book was released as a Reacher novel. Buyer beware.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest, but it always crashed my Kindle fire. Now I can browse freely and not worry. It is a really easy app to use.
B00992CF6W|5.0|so happy this game has all the standard hostile and friendly mobs, crafting, weapons, the only thing missing is redstone and armor
B008LZHA3G|5.0|bob does it again. great music and wonderful flowing lyrics. the king is still in charge. will appeal to all dylan fans and should reach a wider audience of enthusiasts. noone does it like bob. enjoy!
B008IZ5X5Q|3.0|No,no, no.  A convoluted mess.<br /> The silly unbelievable mistakes Dexter makes through out the season ; his running off to Nebraska;  the weird incest thing; to the freaky Dallas like \\" it was a dream or hallucination episode\\".<br /><br />It's as if this seasons writers were starting from scratch and had not seen any of the previous episodes.<br />They had no insight at all into the serial killer/ perfectionist, attention to detail traits we have come to expect from Dexter.  Perhaps the writers are trying to give Dexter a more humane appearing psyche.  Dudes, it's not working.  And the whole Deb going into breakdown mode is lame as you can go.<br /><br />Bring back Lumen for Dexter, give him his balls back.  Drop the weak spine-ed wish-washy Debbie and reintroduce the strong willed Harry's daughter Deborah we used to know.  The one who understood what was going on behind the plastic curtain.  My final suggestion, make the whole of season 6 including Deb's discovery the nightmare it really was and bring back the cool, collected, methodical Dexter we've come to love.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|Took half an hour or so to download the game. The game is all right. Maybe having a bad night for the game.
0547569653|5.0|While I was left a little bit concerned about depression and ultra-runners, I felt this book was inspiring and an honest look at what it takes to be a top ultra-runner. As a vegan and recreational runner I loved the tips and recipes at the chapter ends. Scott seems like a very conscientious person searching for his place in this world as so many of us are.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this app every day. It is easy to use and easy to repinn unlike other apps I have used.
B000AJIF4E|1.0|I bought the MDR 7506 because my professor suggested them. I am in school for Recording Technology and to mix and listen to playback these headphones are ideal.  They give you the true sound of a mixed track.  I don't suggest these as everyday listening headphones because they are a little on the flat side.  If you want a nice clean sounding pair of phones get the AKG 240's.  The bass is a little more beefier but it still stays true and the highs are really clean without distortion.  Plus they are roughly the same price, give or take 5 - 10 bucks up or down.  My AKG's were about $5. less than the MDR's.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE PINTEREST! ITS SO GREAT! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE! AND AGIAN... I LOVE PINTEREST! ITS MY LIFE!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!
B0087HT36U|5.0|Totally worth every single penny of the free price I paid. In all seriousness though, a very fun little game!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is an awesome game. If you haven't played this game yet you got to check it out..... Beware you will be hooked.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|way better than stock monitoring battery options small powerfull app that gives you the basics at a quick glance with so much more to offer.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play everyday as I commute to work. I enjoy multiplayer games. Would give 5 stars but ads are too much.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|i was very disappointed when i read this. it did answer some of my questions, but not nearly as many as i thought it would. in the beginning (until about 50%) it did its job as a prequel, it told the story before. but the second half was almost completely about the characters running around and doing things, solving their current problems. the prologue and epilogue were very random. it also said in the book description that it was mainly about mark and Trina, not mark and Alec, which it was. the ending was very disappointing, and i did not like it one bit. after reading this and the normal maze runner trilogy, i am having second thoughts about buying any more of dashner's books.
1439127700|5.0|I found the book to be fun, informative, entertaining and educational.  More that I expected based on the reviews I saw on TV.  I'm a history buff and I was intrigued by some of the historic information imbedded in the stories.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I used to love this app because u could download mp3 and videos.Now for some reason it wont download anything.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I thought the movie was o.k., but I had the feeling that if I hadn't already read the book, the movie would not have made sense to me.  Some characters lacked development, Cato for instance, in the book you really got the feeling he was evil/mean, not so much in the movie.  The main characters were well played, and did a good job. The costumes/make up were well done, the scenes were good, but the whole movie felt rushed, espcially when they got to the actual games. I was hoping for more, I don't know, energy? It was just lacking something.
B009329Y30|5.0|Fantastic movie, unespected ending. wonderful, moving.<br />Was he just lucky or was God involved in the events. Of course Hollywood couldn't include God or His guidance. But still a great movie.
B004ZN9RWK|1.0|It does not play loud enough to hear it;  not satisfied at all.  I love Pink Floyd and was very disappointed when I tried to listen to it.
030758836X|3.0|Engaging in parts, this novel functions at numerous levels: battle-of-the-sexes x-ray, social satire, and mystery are the most salient.  Yet each level comes up a little short.  The relationship insights are possibly the best, yet they can't carry the weight of a plot that strains belief.  The social satire, well, yeah we know that cable TV \\"news\\" is informational empty calories and many folks act silly in the glare of reflected glory.  As for the mystery, it's just OK (although I do admit that I was charmed by the violation of mystery rule 1: justice shall be served) The novel is to be admired for its ambition, but I was a bit put off by the female character, finding her a novelistic equivalent of Glenn Cose's character in \\"Basic Instinct\\".  That is, a psychopath on auto-pilot.<br /><br />For better treatments of some of the themes of this book, allow me to recommend Michael Blumlein's XY (which could shed some light on the ending which so many here have found unsatisfactory)and Michael Tolkin's \\"Among the Dead\\".
B000268QB2|5.0|Just as good as Strangeland. Not all songs are the same style making every song sound individual and good. Good buy for those who enjoy listening to real music.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Very enjoyable and addicting.  A lot like angry birds.  I like the fact that you can hold your shot and a precise aiming window comes up for those tricky shots.
0525953728|3.0|I effortlessly tore through \\"No Easy Day\\" in one day. It's a simply written book, with great sections of page-turning action, and whatever downtime we encounter, it's enlightening and helps one understand the process, systems, procedures, acronyms/initialisms, state of mind of this author. You get to understand their training, other missions they went on and especially the \\"get UBL\\" mission, which takes up much of the book. As much as I would have liked to know more details about the soldiers, I understand that this book was written with their anonymity and safety in mind. I appreciate that (and I'm sure the soldiers and their families do too). Because of this, because there was no corroboration and because this was one soldier's view on this particular event, it suffers from a little myopia, bolstered just a little by a little bit of research likely conducted and inserted by the co-author. I look forward to reading the full story from different viewpoints some day.<br /><br />I purchased this book for two reasons. 1. I was/am interested in what actually happened during the raid in Abbottabad that killed Osama Bin Laden; 2. While paging through the book in the bookstore, I found that most of the book's proceeds were going to support the families of fallen SEAL team members. Rather noble.<br /><br />All in all, good book. If you're even the slightest bit interested in what went down in May 2011 in Pakistan, consider picking this book up.
0345803493|5.0|My order arrived in on time and i was very surprised because i ordered a used book,but the book was in Brand New condition. Thank you so very much...!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I cant have enough! I love playing these games a lot! its very entertaining!!!  and it has so many games!
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I am a huge fan of Hybrid Theory and Meteora. The last two albums in my opinion were absolutely terrible. Livings Things is a very pleasant surprise and I enjoy the entire CD without skipping any tracks. All their styles seem to combined and that by no means is a bad thing but at least they've gone back to their roots on certain songs which was something badly missing in the last 2 albums. Good effort overall.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A vanilla calculator application.  Not a ti83, just a basic calculator.  It does, though, have a memory feature. Easy to use for day to day arithmetic.
B009329Y30|5.0|This was sn awesome show.  I would recommend it for anyone, yes including the male gender.  I loved the movie and have already recommended it to others.
B000003TA4|5.0|There are not too many albums that I can listen to repeatedly from beginning to end without skipping a song or two. Nevermind is most definitely one of those. I remember when it first came out and I heard Smells Like Teen Spirit. I was instantly hooked. Little did I know, that would be the lesser song of the album, even though in itself Smells Like Teen Spirit is an awesome song. I can't choose a favorite song, but Breed, Lithium, In Bloom, Polly, Lounge Act and Something In The Way are indeed stand-outs. Dave Grohl on drums is an explosive ball of energy that elevates Nevermind from incredible to epic. Kurt Cobain is definitely missed, but his music will live on forever.
1451696191|5.0|this is an amazing coming of age book. It is short, around 200 pages or so, but boy does it pack in personality. You fall in love with the characters immediately and can identify with them as well. I would suggest this as a read to any teenager going through a rough time in high school. Although I read it when I was 22, and still loved it. Can't wait for the movie!
B0053JJLLC|1.0|I couldn't help but feel that if a couple passages were omitted, and some curse words left out, I would have just finished reading a children's book.  The characters were immature.  The central concept was explained on a level that middle schoolers would have easily understood.  The dialogue was atrocious.  Who walks around in a micro-jungle in which some of your closest friends have been brutally killed, and marvels at how fascinating and beautiful it is?  Who says they wish they could stay small forever and conduct research after just seeing most of your best friends die right in front of you?  Horrible.<br /><br />There was zero character development.  I couldn't have cared less who died or whether the bad guy got away with it or not.  I didn't care.  Michael Crichton was great at making far-out concepts believable, but this doesn't do it one bit.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this one, even if you're a Crichton fan, because this isn't Crichton.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app, it is one of my absolute favorites and it works just like it does on my laptop.

B007SSEU9O|3.0|While Meryl Streep was phenomenal the movie would have been better served with more substance while she was Prime Minister. She is young, she's old, her husband is alive, he's dead, she is in command then she is dotty, very annoying and disappointing. In the end, it would be a mistake to miss Streep at her very best.
0062124293|4.0|Just finished How to Be a Woman by Catlin Moran.  It was a hilarious read and I'm glad to have had the chance to check it out.  As I am in my mid-forties I found it refreshing to get a younger gal's take on feminism these days.  She's in her mid-thirties and from working class-England so that's also a little different from the suburban America many of us gals in the U.S. know.  I should warn you, though, that her offerings are often rather candid which means a bit raunchy and, in some cases, sharing some mildly shocking TMI.  As a mom, I'd be comfortable allowing a mature older teen or college-aged person read it.  I think her style is actually very current and most young women would get a total kick out it.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|It was nice book. Liked the plot. Lots of twists in story. I liked the end of story. it was really unexpected end.
B002ZG976U|4.0|I know...another musical but some of the songs are very good-memorable even. Cher is always a power to contend with (what a presence), LOVE STANLEY TUCCI (so cute),and Christina did a pretty good job of acting (her dancing wasn't bad either). There were admittedly some weak spots at points especially in the storyline at time seeming more a modernized version of \\"Cabaret\\" than an original screen play but the performances and the dance numbers were well worth the price.
B00735HGQ6|4.0|Harold is infuriating and fascinating at the same time. Think about the times you didn't call someone back, or dumped a date at the last minute or spoke nicer to the waitress than to your spouse. What if...?

B003EY7IUY|4.0|delivered promptly, no issues.  fun read so far!  mindless- exactly what i need after a long grueling day of not-so-mindless matters at work.
0525953728|5.0|This weekend I read an incredible book, \\"NO EASY DAY\\" by Mark Owen. IT is about Navy SEALS and the Osama operation. IT is NOT blood, gore and war monger, it is sensitive, informative and very interesting. I could not put it down. An amazing read. IT takes you through the training courses to become a SEAL and the life that they live. Their dedication, discipline, and over-all life choice is admirable and unbelievable. The information in the book is nothing that wasn't in the news, or magazines, and I would rather read it right from one of the Seals than on the pages of a trash newspaper or magazine.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I've never been compelled to write a review before, but I am so thoroughly enjoying this game that I wanted to rate it, and found you can't do that without writing a review, so&hellip; if you enjoy puzzles you'll love this game. The early levels start out easy enough, but get progressive harder.  And new elements are introduced often enough to keep it fresh. I find myself passing over 'angry birds', and other games on my phone, and returning to this game time and time again. And the graphics are nice too. They just seem to fit the game and add to the atmosphere.
B0087HT36U|1.0|it works on my droid bionic, but it will not run on my Motorola Xoom tablet. force closes every time.
B004W1GCVE|5.0|This show is yet another wonderful BBC production! I've read comparisons of Upstairs Downstairs to Downton Abbey and honestly the thought never occurred to me that one was coping the other-rather I thought of both as a snap shot of how households were run during different time periods! Love Downton Abbey and I absolutely love Upstairs Downstairs! Please don't let this shows two season legacy stop you from watching!
0553801473|5.0|This is a great addition to the series. This is not a stand alone book. This is #5 in the Song of Ice and Fire Series. Read them all. A good portion of this book is background and side things that fill a lot of holes. A great read! I've read it twice since it has come out already.

B008MG1E4A|3.0|No Easy Day seems to be little more than a self-serving tell-all book in which the author can achieve credit for his role in getting Osama Bin Laden.  While it's interesting to read about his time with Seal Team Six and Osama Bin Laden (especially after 911) I can't help but wonder at the authors motivation to ignore that he signed non-disclosure agreements and go ahead with publishing the book without DOD/CIA approval.
0440242401|4.0|I've seen the movie, The Vow, and read \\"What Alice Forgot\\" by Liane Moriarity. This book is much lighter and funnier. Lexi has lost all memory of the last three years and wakes up to find that her life has completely changed. This book is a fast read, funny, and light-hearted.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This film is packed full of action from the beginning to the end. Some of the characters were a little far-fetched but they played well into the film. A glimpse of future humanity.
0307950689|3.0|I was very disappointed.  The beginning of the book got my attention, but he really jumped the shark after chapeter 100.  It is also formulaic based on his earlier books.  He should have actually killed off the Langdon character instead of miraculously bringing him back to life.

B0091LRZZW|5.0|On February 9, 2012, 69 year old Sir Paul McCartney filmed and recorded LIVE KISSES at Capitol Records Studios in Hollywood- a collaboration of some of the most beautiful old American classic love and hope songs that Sir Paul recalls from his childhood family gatherings. I don't know if this is a co-incidence or not, but these heavenly songs were recorded and filmed exactly 48 years since The Beatles first U.S. appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. It's a wonderful co-incidence as these songs are just as wonderful to listen to as those early Beatles hits.<br /><br />Of all the Beatles, for me, Paul was totally and completely about love, and this latest beautiful achievement of Paul's is a testament to that. I always felt that John was more political, George spiritual, Ringo very rhythmic and Paul was pure love.  I know Paul's voice at 70 is not as powerful as when he had to out scream thousands of fans back in the sixties, but his voice is softly powerful, as it should be for these beautiful classic songs. His voice is so beautifully strong, you wish he would have recorded about a hundred more of these old favorites for this dvd.  I am a child of the fifties, but my mother had a piano and sang many of these 1920's and 1930's songs to me, that she learned as a child, so I know many of these lyrics and can't help but sing along.<br /><br />Live Kisses is produced by grammy winning producer Tommy LiPuma, conducted by Alan Broadbent, with the talents of Al Schmitt in the control room, Diana Krall at the piano, John Clayton, Karriem Riggins, John Pizzarelli on guitar, Anthony Wilson and Mike Mainieri. Paul strictly sings on this dvd and the harmony he creates with his drummer Abe Laboriel Jr. on three of the songs including I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter, is simply pure magic. The talented Joe Walsh (James Gang, Eagles) outdoes himself with his beautiful guitar work on McCartney's MY VALENTINE and also on GET YOURSELF ANOTHER FOOL. Included, besides these beautiful heavenly songs, are interviews with Paul, Diana Krall, Tony LiPuma, Eric Clapton and Stevie Wonder. There are more extras as well.<br /><br />The 13 Classic American Songs Included Are:<br />01.) I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter (1935 Ahlert/Young)- Fats Waller hit<br />02.) Home (When Shadows Fall) (1932 Van Steeden/Clarkson/Clarkson)-  Rudy Vallee hit<br />03.) It's Only A Paper Moon (1933 Arlen/Harburg/Rose)- Count Basie hit<br />04.) The Glory Of Love (1936 Hill)- Andrew Sisters hit<br />05.) More I Cannot Wish You (1950 Loesser)- Guys & Dolls hit<br />06.) We Three (My Echo, My Shadow & Me) (1939 Cogane,Mysels, Robertson)- The Ink Spots hit<br />07.) Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive (1944 Mercer/Arlen)- Andrew Sisters hit<br />08.) My Valentine (Paul McCartney)<br />09.) Always (1925 Berlin)- The Ink Spots, Frank Sinatra hit<br />10.) My Very Good Friend The Milkman (1935 Spina /Burke)- Fats Waller hit<br />11.) Bye Bye Blackbird (1926 Henderson/Dixon)- Gene Austin, Eddie Cantor hit<br />12.) Get Yourself Another Fool (1949 Haywood/Tucker)- Charles Brown, Sam Cooke hit<br />13.) My One And Only Love (1952 Wood/Mellin)- Frank Sinatra hit<br /><br />With Paul using only his voice, and not his other instruments of his bass, guitar and piano, he really focuses on the beauty of the sentimental lyrics, and what you get is pure magic beautifully sung with the gorgeous music accompanying him. I first heard Paul singing these classics in the kitchen while cooking and asked my husband what he was watching on tv- when he said Paul McCartney- I almost fell over, as I would never recognize Paul doing these American classics. He is simply amazing!<br /><br />As much as I love all these old 20's, 30's depression, 40's war years and 50's songs, I adore Irving Berlin's ALWAYS. You can feel the love in the words, as Irving Berlin wrote this song for the woman he wanted to marry, but whose father forbid it. Because Irving was a struggling poorJewish writer and was in love with a wealthy Christian woman Ellin Mackay, Ellin's father forbid she see him, so he sent her overseas to Europe. Irving didn't let an ocean stop him from telling his beloved Ellin that he loved her, so he wrote ALWAYS and it played on the radios all over the world. When Ellin heard it, she couldn't believe how much Irving loved her and married him against her father's wishes.  The words are so fitting- I'll Be Loving You Always- as I have always felt that Paul McCartney's music has always said the same thing to not only his girlfriends or wives, but to his fans. From the first time I heard The Beatles sing, Til There Was You, Paul was the Irving Berlin of my 60's generation. He just knows how to make you feel love.<br /><br />If you are a McCartney fan or simply love the old American Classic Songs from the 20's, 30's, 40's and 50's, you will love LIVE KISSES, and I guarantee you will not be able to keep from singing along and wish there was much more of this beautiful music from Sir Paul! And to Sir Paul who just keeps on giving us fans such beautiful unexpected gifts- I say to you from your fans- We'll Be Loving You Always And Thank You Sir Paul For Yet Another Gift Of Love!Jewish writer and was in love with a wealthy Christian woman Ellin Mackay, Ellin's father forbid she see him, so he sent her overseas to Europe.

B009186E3O|5.0|For Rolling Stones fans, it doesn't get any better than this new, completely restored version of CHARLIE IS MY DARLING- a 1965 Stones 2 day documentary.  When the Rolling Stones were scheduled for a 2 day tour performing in Ireland on September 3rd and 4th in 1965, their original manager Andrew Loog Oldham asked Peter Whitehead if he would film the Rolling Stones showing what a typical tour was like for the Stones. Whitehead agreed and filmed the Stones for the 2 days. After filming, it took until the Spring of 1966, for Whitehead to put together the film he wanted to show.<br /><br />When Whitehead was finished with the final copy, the film showed the Rolling Stones traveling on a train, getting on and off planes, riding in cars, studio rehearsals, a few concert clips with incomplete songs such as: Get Off My Cloud, Heart Of Stone, Play With Fire, Maybe It's Because I'm A Londoner, I'm All Right and The Last Time. Not only were the songs incomplete, but the video/audio were out of sync. He also shot a lot of footage showing how the fans mobbed the Stones. The best part of this first ever Rolling Stones documentary was the interview with Brian Jones. The film was made up of bits and pieces from filming for 2 days and ended up at 50 minutes.<br /><br />This 50 minute film was shown in only a few theater's and ended up not only rarely seen, but shelved until now. The ABKCO company decided to find more of the original film, meticulously restore it and put it out on dvd, blu-ray and a deluxe boxed 5 disc version. The deluxe boxed 5 disc version will have the 2012 version dvd, the blu-ray director's/ producer's cut, 2 cd's and a vinyl LP. They found more film of the Stones cramped in basement dressing rooms, writing songs in motel rooms, complete electrifying performances of Time Is On My Side, The Last Time and their huge hit, I Can't Get No Satisfaction, and more.<br /><br />ABKCO has restored over 90,000 frames of optical screen prints and negatives, the original sound tapes and 3 track live recording. They said this new, never seen restored version is so crisp and clear, it will be just like being back in 1965 seeing Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman live.  Since I am a huge Brian Jones fan, as I thought he kept the Stones on more of a blues sound, as after Brian's death, I thought the Stones became too commercial, I am so looking forward to seeing this first Stones documentary, especially the Brian Jones interview. This very first pristinely and meticulously restored with new footage 1965 Rolling Stones documentary is definitely a must have for any early Rolling Stones or Brian Jones fan!d tapes and 3 track live recording.

0756405890|5.0|This is a GREAT read.  Thank God the second book is out....but it's waiting time on the third which hasn't been published yet.  It will be really hard to wait.  The story is complex and the characters are likable.  This is available in both trade paperback (more expensive but a LOT nicer and worth having if you collect) and mass market.  None of Rothfuss's books stay on the shelf in used book sellers--tells you how good this is.
0525953728|5.0|This was a very easy read, that was hard to put down.  The narrative was made me feel like I was there (minus the fear of getting shot or fatigued).  I think this book does much props for the SEALS, especially Team 6. I've read many of the first hand accounts, the early books by Marcinco, etc... this one fits perfectly among its peers.  I highly reccomend this book.
0756407125|5.0|Read the first book before you read this.  This is a VERY good read.  It's complex and interesting.  There are almost no used books available in the stores--sellers saying they can't keep it in stock.  This comes in trade paperback only right now.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|I am not going to repeat what most of the other reviewers have said, except to say, I am a big fan. Downloaded the Kidndle app just to read the Deep Down short.  Loved second son.  The reason I point this out is that the shorts seem to be as far as Lee can go lately.  Maybe it is dealing with the absurd idea of Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher.  Hey it worked out for Anne Rice, but Lestat isn't 6'5\\" 250 lbs.  I don't know.  Child has definitely  lost his fast ball.<br /><br />I have been to the mid west several times and I cannot believe this is the best place to center the last three novels.  As the other reviewers said, too much time in the car.  Too much hang around and sound like a mathematician time (too much math talk).  No resounding ending with capturing or confronting the bad guy.  I did not get a good idea of the bad guys lair from the descriptions.  This just simply was not plausible.  Yes the FBI are a bunch of backside covering buffoons at times, but even they would not be so incompetent as portrayed here.<br /><br />I want Reacher to jump off of the page against bad people who did not expect the train wreck that was coming.  The last few novels have only had them realize this in the last 1/2 to 1/4 of the book.  I listened to this from a download on Audible, which is the only thing that save me from canning the whole thing.  I don't think I could of read the whole book in one day as I have most of the others in the series.<br /><br />But, like a lot of authors who just start running this stuff through the mill, (Clancy, Patterson, Grisham) this character seems to have met the downward spiral of his arc.  Sad.  Lee Child, wake up!  Either kill Reacher off, or re-energize yourself and the franchise.
0778328821|5.0|I love this series. Even though the first book in the series I read was somewhere in the middle, going back to the first one wasn't hard to do!... Just bought another one from the series, can't wait to get it! :)
B008220AVW|5.0|I went to see \\"Katy Perry: Part Of Me\\" at my local theater on July 9, 2012; 5 days after it was first released; and again in 3D format on July 18th with a close friend of mine. I knew when I went to see it that it was NOT going to be boring; even just the name Katy Perry is enough to take the dull out of my day. I've been a fan since \\"California Gurls\\" in 2010. The stuff from \\"One Of The Boys\\" I liked a little later on. What I didn't expect however was how much this film made me love her and her work A LOT more than I did before. There were A LOT of scenes and songs that touched my heart in ways I never expected. One scene was one of her meet and greets where she asks people if they want to dance on stage with her that coincided with her performance of Whitney Houston's \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\\". If you liked it on Katy's \\"California Dreams\\" tour, you'll love it here too.<br />Another was what I call the \\"Hey Jude\\" scene, when Katy talked about how she handled her divorce from Russell Brand. I can't remember exactly what she said, although I knew what the subject matter was. COME ON! It's been 2 months since I last saw it. A piano version of \\"Hey Jude\\" played in the background during her interview. Then came the cruncher; her MusicCares rehearsal of that same song. That made my heart go \\"KNOCK ME OUT! KNOCK ME OUT!!\\"<br />All in all, I knew I was gonna see something truly cool, but I never thought it would be THIS cool! Maybe it's just me. I hope not!

B004XVN1T4|4.0|First I ordered a sample through Amazone on my Kindle and got interested to read more, hence I ordered the book. In the beginning it is very descriptive and it does not yet reveal the direction it might take. I very much like the details which seem to be equally important for the author - tension is building up as the story goes on - for the last 20 % of the book it's hard to put it down.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book. I never felt like I knew how it was all going to end. Such an interesting story, and in the end it's just an extreme tale of most marriages. There are always secrets and compromise, this story just takes it a few steps further. Sometimes there are no easy answers

B001VTTRC6|4.0|The thing that stands out the most in this movie is the performances, specifically Sean Penn's. His level of emotion is great. The story is good and the script was good too and if you dont feel some strong emotions watching this movie, then something must be wrong with you.

B0083SBJXS|4.0|There was a mountain of hype and expectation for this movie, building at an exponential rate as its release date approached. Many thought it had the brass to perhaps equal or unseat \\"The Dark Knight\\" as the best comic book movie of all time. It succeeded.<br /><br /> The level of play between the characters is unprecedented in a super hero film. These guys simply hated each other before finally joining forces, this portion of the film alone makes it the greatest of all time (the CGI and explosive ending is just the icing on the cake)<br /><br /> There is not a single bad acting job in the cast that I can recall(although Samuel L Jackson essentially plays the same character he does in all of his movies)<br /><br />It is not the perfect movie, but the script and strong acting were enough to propel this movie into the highest reaches of comic book adaptations.<br /><br />I wont spoil any of it for you, just go ahead and buy or rent this movie already !
0525953728|5.0|Excellent book , hard to put down. I took my kindle to work so i could continue to read every chance i got. The author made you feel like you were along side him all the way through the entire mission. Would highly recommend this one.

B0046HA26A|5.0|I've had 3 pairs of these shoes and decided to mix it up by getting the black and green color the third time around. They're just as good as the blue ones which I ran the Chicago marathon in. I've got a slight pronation and use custom orthopedic inserts. The GTS 11's have never failed me and I still use the last pair as a comfy slip on shoe to run errands and such on the weekends. Good quality and light weight material.
B006O7XOOW|2.0|[Note: If you are assembling this, put the leg with the blue and orange blocks in front of the spinning thing, explanation within]<br /><br />I give this toy 2-stars overall because our less than 25lb baby can make this topple on her very easily while trying to pull-up to stand.  The fact that the product description states it encourages physical development by \\"pulling-up\\" suggests they hadn't done full product testing with 7-8 month olds.  [The box says it is for 6-36 months, I feel it should say 12-36 months]  I also give 2-stars because while our baby is standing (she cannot walk yet), as she leans on this, the entire thing will start sliding on our standard issue carpet.  (We had to move this off her typical foam playmat and off her special blanket that we lay usually lay down before we put her toys down, those will always make this slide.)<br /><br />I didn't give this 1-star merely for the fact that the height of it, is half her length (and most 7-8 month olds) and therefore, the one time it toppled over her, it landed in her chest area and not on her head and she was more stunned than anything and didn't cry. Since then its use has been 100% supervised and I've caught the thing from toppling over many times.<br /><br />Also, while she is learning to stand-up, she will try to grab the balls on top with one hand, keeping her balance with the other.  Depending on where she is grabbing to balance herself and if she's moved her legs or not, this thing will start sliding on the carpet.  I've caught it everytime, but this is why I firmly believe the age should be 12-36 months when kids are standing up on their own and not needing a lot of balance-aids.  A toddler that can stand up on their own won't be leaning on this as much for balance.<br /><br />With that out of the way, yes, I think this is an OK toy and encourages her to grab and look for the balls, pulling up (with supervision) and continue standing-up and holding herself up.  The concept is neat, but the music I feel should be more toddler-ish, it sounds very 80's Electronica and out of place.  I also wish there were more interactive \\"buttons\\" around each leg to start the lights and music.<br /><br />I assembled this twice because I found that the side with the \\"spinning thing\\", always had the balls coming out and rolling all over the place since it didn't catch them correctly.  I noticed that the leg with the blue and orange pieces always caught the balls.  So logically, I switched the legs so that the leg with the blue and orange pieces would be nearest the \\"spinning thing\\" which will be the side she will be on when she's activating the \\"ball-cano\\".  Now the balls rolling all over the place has been minimized greatly. You may also want to swap any other leg you notice catches the balls more consistently than the other.<br /><br />Overall:<br />=========<br />If the leg-base were wider and it didn't have such an easy propensity to topple over and it had better traction to keep from sliding on standard issue carpet, then I would have given 4 stars.  Since it has these 2 flaws for a 7-8month old's usage, I feel 2-stars is fair.  For a 12month and older, I think it would have been a better experience.

0566076896|4.0|The book makes sense and is easy to follow.  It is aimed at those selling long term services or making larger sales.  It is not the book for someone whose bread and butter is high volume small sales such as retail sales. It is excellent if you are selling or would like to begin to sell legal, accounting, or similiar services.

B0064MT1FI|5.0|Good quality, I just knew the movie and I wanted to have the DVD in my collection. It's a kind of \\"classic\\" movie.  The story is intense and delicate at the same time. Great interpretation from well known actors. It's my favourite movie ever. Great music also, of course!
B00846REIS|4.0|Didn't want to put the book down.  Rated R for sure...<br />I recommend this book to anyone that is a 50 shades of Grey fan.
1401324649|4.0|This story had me chuckling, giggling and outright laughing out loud throughout! I don't think I've ever read such a far fetched, crazy, intertwined tale with such a host of unlikely,colorful, wacky characters (to include an elephant)!!!  Normally I'm not a fan of stories that are too far fetched BUT the wilder this story got the better!  I hate spoilers so I won't give anything away about this one but if you get in the mood for a good laugh this book would be a great choice.<br /><br />Only negative....  I really could have done without the language that was thrown in here and there.  In many places it was just stated that there was swearing and other times it was spelled out.  It was much funnier when the author chose to tell the story using the former method.  JMO. This is the sole reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  With that said, this book was indeed hilarious!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Awesome detective game. And it is not a short hidden object game. Great storyline that keeps you guessing until the end. Cant wait for the sequel to come out

B006LSZECO|1.0|Okay, I consider myself I person who can fall deep into just about any book that is set in front of me. I am currently majoring in English Lit. So I am kind of forced to have a knack at reading anything and everything. I almost always end up enjoying every book that I read, and this isn't a small statement. I have probably read over thirty books this year alone.<br /><br />I enjoy reading for pleasure, but because of my busy schedule I do not have the time to try out any random book that I come across, so I tend to stick to the New York and Kindle best sellers. Gone Girl was a book that I was planning on reading for pleasure. I had very high hopes for this book, due to how fast it became popular as I watched it rise higher and higher on the best seller list. Needless to say, I ended up being very disappointed.<br /><br />After the first forty pages or so I felt no need to continue reading, this normally does not happen to me. The overall feel of the book just comes off too cold to be enjoyable. The novel begins with a guy whose life has basically gone to shit. He and his wife, Amy, have both lost their jobs and have moved from New York to his hometown in Missouri because his mother has recently died. With the last of their money, the man, Nick, opens up a bar with his twin sister, Margo.<br /><br />Most of Nick's thoughts are about how he no longer feels connected with his wife. He recalls memories of times when he has made Amy mad, and times when Amy has made him upset as well. He describes his home as lonely. On his fifth year anniversary, he avoids his wife at all costs, and then complains about her to his sister at 'The Bar.' And then, to top it all off, when Nick comes home after a phone call from an alcohol dependent neighbor saying that his front door is wide open, he finds his house rummaged through, and his wife missing.<br /><br />How is the reader supposed to care about his wife's absence when he doesn't even give a crap about her anymore? The couple does not exchange one sentence of a conversation in the beginning of the book before Amy is found missing. I feel like their relationship is not given any foundation to the reader for them to really care about the main dilemma going on in the book. I know I sure didn't.<br /><br />I surprisingly could not finish the book, could not even get past forty or so pages. Maybe I should have given it a bit more of a chance, but the book felt too cold, too depressing, too jumbled around from Nick's thoughts to Amy's past diary thoughts. Nick's thoughts in 2012, to Amy's thoughts in 2005. And after reading enough reviews to confirm that the ending sucks, I was left with no motivation to continue reading, but enough to write this review to let others know.not exchange one sentence of a conversation in the beginning of the book before Amy is found missing.

0345803493|5.0|I had heard so much about this trilogy and read reviews too.  I though well let me give it a try, I was captivated and can't get enough.  I do not want these books to end I can't wait to see what has happened in the lives of the charters.  I normally do not like this kind of book, I am a half way through the second book I want to make it last but also can't wait to see what happens next.

B000AU9UYM|3.0|Ok, we all know that the 1997 flick, Batman and Robin was a total disaster, and we were yearning for a watchable Batman movie that would resurrect the franchise, but are we rating Batman Begins on pure emotion? Are we comparing it to Batman and Robin? Is it me, or was this movie a tad boring? It starts off at an anemic pace, then builds some momentum as Bruce Wayne finally gets up to speed as the character we've come to know. By the way, I didn't think much of Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne, though he wasn't terrible. There is an All-Star cast in this movie, which helps give it its credibility. I didn't like the Gotham City in this movie; it was too modern looking, and took away the atmosphere and tone. I prefer the way Tim Burton did the first two films, in that he created a darker and more believable setting. However, this movie has a solid storyline, especially with Wayne's personal conflict with how to handle himself as the winged vigilante. It just comes up short on screen. I found it to have too many slow parts, and was waiting for it to hit its stride, but never did.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game is old but still very addicting. It does get repetetive but you already knew that and its still fun and challanging.
B005LAII3A|4.0|I was a big fan of the cheesy 1990 movie with Arnold and the Canadian series Total Recall 2070 with Michael Easton and Karl Pruner. Anyways, this movie is pretty good as long as you go into it knowing that they don't go to Mars and the storyline is not exactly like Arnold's 1990 version. So if you have an open mind, it's very entertaining. The special effects, gadgets and the plot are good. I was very disappointed that Michale Ironsides character Richter and Benny the cabbie were removed. The three breasted hooker was a nice touch. I was disappointed that they didn't go to Mars. This was a huge detour from the original story that Philip K. Dick wrote. I'm not a huge Colin Farrel fan, but his acting along with Jessica Biel and Kate Beckensale really gives some meat and potatoes to the movie.The energy level and action is high, with few very lulls. I think the Mars storyline combined with some more humor would have made this a five star movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Total Recall 2070 series to anyone who liked either of the Total Recall movies. The main plot of that series is primarily about a detective who constantly investigate the mysterious business practices of the company Recall. Recall often skirts the limit of the law, and when they do, they obstruct the detective with armies of lawyers. The detective has a partner who is equally mysterious and has many secrets of his own. This was a very nice spin off of the Arnold movie.

B003ELY7PG|5.0|I met Jason at a conference and was very impressed by his clear and open approach to both running a business and taking care of the people within it.

B003TSEEDY|3.0|The book started off interesting and captured my interest early on. I found it refreshing and charlie was a smart character. The complexities of the friendships were nice, but i felt sam and charlie's relationship left  me a bit under whelmed. i didn't like the hasty ending and the revelation of aunt helen was confusing. All in all, interesting book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an excellent book. I haven´t read something that strong in a while. I felt just trapped by it.
0385344333|3.0|My niece asked me a couple of hours ago what this book was about, and although I'd just put it down I found I couldn't remember. Dementia, possibly, but also lack of engagement.  It's got some good observations on team behavior and hitchhiking and freeway exits, enough to amuse and make us feel we're in good hands, but somewhere it all kind of drifts away, and later he even throws in some details that are just wrong:  Weather systems in the U.S. move left to right, normally--if Reacher sees a big storm way off to the east over the plains, it has been and gone, it's not coming at him, as Child would have it.  The winds don't move the way he says they do either, so if he's trying to give us a sense of place he shouldn't be so careless, the story's not strong enough to make us overlook it.  The end, complicated as it was, and as novel a concept as it involves, was just thrown in there at the last minute without a leadup to the subject (other than diagrams of the battleground we were supposed to keep in our heads)--the rest of the book wasn't necessarily going there, or anywhere, really.  It's Lee Child, so the style will carry you along, but if it were your first of his you probably wouldn't bother picking up another.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63 is a true masterpiece.  King first had the idea for this one back in the early 70s, but the research required seemed too daunting.  I'm glad he waited.

B0055PGUYU|5.0|I just can't put this book down.  As a professional organizer I am always looking to improve my skills through the understanding of human behaviors.  This book clearly describes how habits are formed, how they can be changed.  I bought this book to help me improve my business marketing skills and find it has done that while it opened doors to understanding myself and my clients as well.  Highly recommended!

B00407PNWO|5.0|Great bargain on Amazon for a movie that I've enjoyed seeing over the years. The DVD is very high quality and showcases the old-time Hollywood Technicolor at its very best. It's nice to see Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHaviland in their prime in a good old-fashioned swashbuckler. If you haven't seen it, make it a point to do so, if you don't own it, get it.
B00170KA0C|4.0|This movie was a great depiction of the inner conflict that women were experiencing in the 1950's.  It follows a group of privileged young women during a year on their path to becoming educated wives.  However, their journey is interrupted with the arrival of a new art professor; a West Coast free thinker who challenges their beliefs.  The characters each epitomize the complexity of the feminine soul and how we often are our own worst enemies.  Showing the funny side of conflict, and how one person who cares just enough can change the path of a person - or cement it; this movie is a wonderful, enjoyable journey.  Definitely recommend for a mother daughter night or that girls night in, although the hubs enjoyed it as well!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|A tale as old as time. A book i first read as a child and imagined myself to be Jim Hawkins himself as the tale unfolded.<br />  As story that never grows old no matter how many times you read it and i reckon i must have just read it for the tenth time.<br />I have seen all the T.V. shows and movies of this great adventure story and never tire of them. Be you young or old get this for a great read.<br /><br />Derek Cocking

B007XELMO4|3.0|I used the strap shot for the first time on a hike this weekend. Worked great - easy to get at, didn't notice the extra weight or twist my pack. The only issue I had - and it's a big one - was when I bent at the waist to pull a stick out of my dogs paw. Somehow my camera twisted just right and it fell out of the slot and onto the ground breaking my lens. Not sure if this is a fluke or what. Doesn't seem like it should happen, but it did so be aware if you get inverted.

0525953728|5.0|This was a very fast read.  THERE ARE NO SECRETS in this book.  If you have read other Navy SEAL books, this one reads the same way.  The authoer doesn't go into detail about things he shouldn't and just tells a story.  While I question why so many SEALs are suddenly in the spotlight, I understand why this book was written to set the record straight.
B008BM9L72|1.0|I do not see what all the fuss is about! The book is poorly written and could not get my interest beyond the first few pages. It is merely a Mills and Boone ..... with the sex. Interestingly my wife had the same view.
0756697875|5.0|This book is amazingly well done.  I am extremely happy about what they did with it.  Since they didn't have as many LEGO products done in the Batman theme I was worried it would be small and filled with boring information that could be found in fifteen seconds on a google search. The mini figure was wonderfully done.  They put in the new Bat-cowl, and they did a good job with it.  They thinned out the piece so that it looks better and looks like it could function as a mask/helmet unlike the previous one which seemed too bulky.  For collectors and anyone else who wants to know, Batman has arm, leg, back, and cowl printing.  This is an astonishing book and is suggested for all Batman or Lego fans.

B006CEYM3Y|5.0|Trajan is the kind of game that has a lot of replay value. Because there are so many options and ways to score, and because of the rondel, which you use to determine what you can do on each turn, it makes for a very intensive brain-burning session, which I really love. Yes, there are cubes and \\"people\\" that you place on the board to do various things, but it really has a very different feel from other worker-placement games, and the rondel mechanism is very elegant in this format. The theme is there though it's not a major part of the game play. I wasn't sure what to expect with this mechanism, but after one play I was convinced and have since sought out other Feld games to buy. Limited turns keeps you on your toes, lots of ways to score, intriguing rondel mechanic, great strategy game. Very recommended!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|This version does not work on Samsung Galaxy Nexus (Verizon), stock, ICS 4.04. This is still version 1.2. The Google Play Store edition has been updated multiple times and is now on version 1.35. There is a disturbing trend on the Amazon Appstore of selling old and outdated versions of apps, which discourages me from purchasing through them. I'd rather buy from Google and get timely updates that actually fix newer problems.

B0012GTZFC|4.0|Tribal Leadership is a good book to read through if you're looking to understand your corporate culture and wish to improve it.<br /><br />The book discusses 5 stages or corporate culture, but everyone I talk to who read it seems to get different things out of it.  Most people I talk to get stuck on all the stages as stages of progression.<br /><br />However, in my experience working with and researching many technology companies, my interpretation of this book is a little different.  From my perspective, different companies NEED to be at different stages depending on their goals.  If you're a small company and growing, you are so dependent on individual contributions because each individual has a profound effect on the financial viability of a company.  As such, you may need the type of individual and the type of group culture that this group refers to as Stage 3, where individual success is so critical to the culture.  In some scenarios you may need stage 4 individuals.<br /><br />In a perfect world, I think you need a mix of cultural and individual stages to really benefit the company in the immediate/short term, and the long term.<br /><br />What's more, I think that a diversity in culture is critical to a company's continued growth and evolution.  A company where everyone has the same culture is one that will stagnate.  A community that has a mix that is well pieced together is one that will be successful now, successful next year, and successful in years to come.  As a macro culture, it is great to occasionally have stage 4 and stage 5 periods when the entire company is moving forward with the same mind, but to always be in this state is almost cultish and unhealthy in the long term, especially since such single-minded culture is really a kind of blindness to all the issues people face every day.<br /><br />Having said all that, I'd say this is an excellent book, a super fast and easy read, insightful, and may lay some concrete foundations for what most of usthink about but haven't codified and clarified the way this book does.<br /><br />If you deal with teams or groups of teams, this is definitely a good read.
1936608898|5.0|This is the type of book that you buy extra copies to give to people you care about. I wanted to wait until I completed a \\"Whole 30\\" before I did my review of the book so that I could say that I had not only read the book, but walked the walk.<br /><br />There are many, many reviews here that say what I would say about ISWF, so I need not repeat them here. What I do want to say is that this is a suburb and well written book that is easy to read and with pleasant bits of tough love and humor spread throughout. More importantly, the book is first and foremost a presentation of why what we eat is so important when it comes to giving our body the best chances to thrive rather than survive.  But right after the \\"why\\" comes the \\"how\\" to thrive.<br /><br />When it comes to the \\"how\\", Dallas and Melissa present their ideas in a warm manner that surely radiates their personalities through print. As you read you know and feel that you can trust what they put forth in terms of food choices, food relationships and how the biology works.  Their writing style is easy to read and at least for me, their words and phrasing read as if I could hear them coaching and nudging me in the right direction for health and wellbeing.  What was very important for me was the way they pieced everything together so that I better understood food's impact on how our hormones work, how cravings come about (plus how to defeat them) and how to find a balance in one's approach to food.<br /><br />The reader doesn't, and shouldn't get the idea that they're promoting a fad diet in any way, but rather the reader is reintroduced to what Mother Nature intended for human nutrition - plain and simple.  What you should take away from the book is that this all makes perfect sense with regard to what we should eat, how simple it all is, and just how much better life can be. The bottom line, ISWF does a wonderful job of explaining how our best chance to thrive centers around feeling our bodies the way they evolved to be cared for.<br /><br />And about that Whole 30 I did before writing this review - it was a life changing experience. I got so much from the experience that I started another Whole 30 right after the first one.to be cared for.<br /><br />And about that Whole 30 I did before writing this review - it was a life changing experience.

B005MYWZIO|4.0|This guy was hyped so much before the album came out that I had very high expectations. Plus, I heard his song \\"Tell Me a Tale\\" on a Mojo Magazine sampler CD and was really blown away by it. It wasn't terribly original, but the sound was a refreshing one, harkening back to those glory days of 1970s singer-songwriters. Anyway, I finally got this CD and heard ALL the songs ... and felt bit of a let down. In addition to \\"Tell Me a Tale\\" (which opens the album), there were a few other head-turning tracks, but most of the songs sounded too languid and mellow. Not much jumped out and grabbed me. After many more listenings, I've come to like the album a lot more, but I still feel it's far from a classic. But there are flashes of brilliance on here, and I'm excited about what this very young musician might have in store for us in the years ahead. A very promising debut.

B008Y2IU12|2.0|The more I watch Kristen Stewart, the more I come to the conclusion that she has no or little personality.  In this movie she played Bella (Twilight), nope, I mean Em (Adventureland), nope, I mean Sarah (Panic Room), nope, I mean Snow White.  I think you get the idea.  She is blah in the entire movie.  The other parts of this movie are pretty predictable as well - Charlize Theron cries (again - she does it in every single movie she's ever made).  Chris Helmsworth, who I generally like, has a bad, quasi Scottish accent that comes and goes.  Please do not waste your time with this flick!

His voice is beautiful (those falsettos) and the way he takes songs and make it into a slower more beautiful melody is creative talent. Sierra Leone is my favorite song ever, just cause the end. and Pyramids is beautiful too.Pink Matter is about Vagina , but his metaphors are great , you would actually think he's singing about cotton candy. I find myself waking up with a channel ORANGE song stuck in my head every morning. I love Drowning in Frank Ocean. <3 channel ORANGE is timeless.

B008K7WCJM|5.0|Other reviewers have excellently described this album, however I felt compelled to join in the accolades this album is receiving. I sat stunned for a half hour after listening to the entire album. I stress 'entire' album because it is quite a workout at two hours length (and it is after all a Swans' album, so we know it is going to be intense in one way or another). Perhaps 'workout'  does not best describe the listening experience: The Seer is more a compulsory force. I find it a rare experience now a days to come across an album which commands such attention from the listener, to such a degree that I feel it will wrest and extricate attentive listening even against your own will. While listening, I listened: I did not read things on the internet but just listened; the only parallel activity I could engage in was one that would enhance the act of listening, which for me is drawing -and I drew the most aberrant things for some reason. In our present condition of saturated exposure, I think this fact alone is quite remarkable. I feel that this is the album that transforms Swans into all I always wanted them to be. Swans has always been a difficult bird, requiring me to be in a very specific mood to listen to them. I always appreciated the brilliance underlying their vision and sound, but when they weren't draining my soul with their optimism I just couldn't listen to them. In other words, I always wanted to listen to them, but could not always bring myself to enjoy the experience completely -if that makes sense). Paradoxically, this hasn't changed all that much since it is still a demanding album. However, The Seer finally demands in a way that perfectly articulates the pure drive that Gira has been creating/accumulating for 30 years. Swans is still bleak and apocalyptic, but the brilliant structure of the songs/album reaches the apex that I had always desired. That is to say, all the desire that Swans channelled in the past somehow beyond themselves is achieved in The Seer. The Seer is an album of desire. It activates desire through violent submission of the listener by force. I have never heard Swans perform this well, this intelligently, with such devastation (whatever that means) and logical brilliance. It is a visual experience for the ears, one that must be seen. Psychedelic synaesthesia. One of the best albums out there. Instant classic.he Seer. The Seer is an album of desire. It activates desire through violent submission of the listener by force.

B000KLRUKC|5.0|Karajan does what you expect of Karajan, and I'm not always convinced by his choices, although I can't deny that they are anything but \\"anonymous\\" and show a strong personality ready not to do exactly what you expect. The reading is sonically sumptuous, with a huge chorus (but with a deficit in bass I found), but sometimes lacking in dramatic bite, prone to linger too much, either unduly sentimentalizing the music or giving a nagging impression that it is dangerously close to plodding. It is interesting to compare Karajan's tempos to the metronome marks indicated in the score: he is often slower, sometimes significantly. Not that it is proper to Karajan, although the Austrian conductor revels in it. But interpretive habits have been established (and I don't know enough the historical recordings to know when it happened) which everybody seems happy to follow even when they contradict the score. Take the Aria of Radames in Act I, \\"Celeste Aida\\", played at circa 92 eighth-notes/mn rather than the score's 116, lending it a dreamy and plangent tone, rather than the impassioned character that I can imagine the score's 116 would exude, and that I can't help find better suited to the character of Radames and opening situation. But, although I doubt it is true, I'll credit Karajan with a sense of architectural coherence since, interestingly, that 92 eighth-notes becomes the 92 quarter-notes/mn of the ensuing recitative with Amneris, this one indeed indicated by the score and scrupulously followed by the performers.<br /><br />Similar comments could be made on various numbers, like the Amneris-Aida recitative at the beginning of Act II (CD 1 track 10), languid but lacking an undercurrent of tension, or the Act III Aida-Radames duet (CD 2 track 6) which, for all the vocal beauty of its soloists, lacks a touch of radiant passion I find, as would have been brought by a slightly more animated tempo.<br /><br />Though Karajan's tempo is not much under the metronome mark, the FirstAct \\"call to war\\" (CD 1 track 5 at 3:32), \\"su del Nil\\", sounds laden and ponderous - those who were 20 in 1914 or 1861 will remember that patriotic calls to war are usually more enthusiastic than that (returns from patriotic wars are something else). But I guess you can say in its favor that it has a unique character that way. There are other such passages where Karajan aims for solemn grandeur, which goes with a touch of ponderousness (final chorus of Act I for instance, CD 1 track 8, Act II chorus \\"Glory on Egypt\\", CD 1 track 12 before the famous Aida march) or sounds (to me) a touch too languid and dragging (the women's chorus at the beginning of Act II, CD 1 track 9). The Amonasro-Radames-Aida confrontation at the end of Act III plods a bit at times (CD 2 track 8). But I rather like the solemnity of the big and famous Act II fanfare, CD 1 track 13: there's something interestingly funeral about it. And maybe Karajan had first-hand memories of triumphal fanfares. When the recording was made, in 1959, these would have been less than two decades old.<br /><br />Sometimes it works. Aida's Act III Aria, \\"Patria mia\\", is beautiful, with a sorrowful wistfulness entirely suited to the meaning, and the Aida-Amonastro Act III duet is also quite effective, although I find that Cornell MacNeil lacks some of the darker hues necessary to fully bring out the destructive violence of his \\"Su dunque sorgete egizie coorti / now rise, egyptian legions\\" (CD 2 track 5 at 4:00): but Karajan and the orchestra amply make up for it. The final Amneris-Radames confrontation in Act IV (CD 2 track 10) is superb, and there is great dramatic and desperate sweep to the final Amneris Arioso with (or against) chorus of priests, not despite of, but because of the relatively held-back tempo of Karajan (CD 3 track 12 at 4:18).<br /><br />There's a nice effort to place the High Priestress and chorus of priestresses, \\"almighty Ftah\\" (CD 1 track 7), the men's chorus at the beginning of Act III, \\"You ofOsiris immortal mother and wife\\" (CD 2 track 3), or again the introductory chorus to the trial of Radames (CD 3 track 11 at 2:28) and the trial itself (track 12) in the background, since they are supposed to be sounding \\"from inside\\" or \\"from underground\\", and it is highly atmospheric, although the opening harps in the first chorus sound simply set in mono rather than distant and the second chorus is really very far \\"inside\\". The Act III chorus sounds beautifully like Gregorian chant - not really in situation in Ancient Egypt, but very appropriate to late 19th Century Italy. I find the attempt to play with distance in the opera's final trio (Amneris forward, Radames and Aida in a distant halo) less successful - but I salute the attempt. The recording was made in 1959 and in the 1989 CD reissue which I have, [[ASIN:B0000041PU Verdi: Aida]], there is perceptible tape hiss, which I rapidly became accustomed to and forgot about. But hopefully this subsequent reissue and remastering will have solved some of that.<br /><br />But all these notes, positive or critical, are secondary details. Whatever one's doubts about this or that choice of the conductor or the sound engineers, an Aida succeeds or fails on its three main voices, and I find this trio superb. Unlike Zinka Milanov in the 1955 recording with Björling under Jonel Perlea ([[ASIN:B000003EQ2 Verdi: Aida]]), Tebaldi has the purity of tone I believe the role and character require, on the face of which the fact that she sounded slightly strained in some passages of Act III (and maybe she was on the day they were recorded) doesn't count for much. I also seemed to me the final A of the \\"Patria mia\\" aria was a bit flat (CD 2 track 4 at 6:53), can anybody confirm if they hear the same?<br /><br />Bergonzi may not quite have the youthful clarity and warmth of Björling, and at the end of \\"Celeste Aida\\" he doesn't deliver the pianissimos called for by Verdi, but he has all the youthful valiance of the character and lateron he offers plenty of beautiful nuance. And Simionato has the great mezzo timbre and dark hues of her role. The comprimari are also fine, although Corena as the Pharaoh isn't the basso profundo usually cast in the role and he is not timbrally very much differentiated from Ramfis the High Priest (Arnold van Mill). Cornell MacNeil as Amonstro (ooops... that typo was not intended, but now that I've seen it I'll keep it) has a beautiful lyrical baritone voice, but, as mentioned above, somewhat lacking in darkness for the character.<br /><br />\\"Celeste Aida\\"? No, not just her. A celestial trio and a conductor with a strong if controversial personality.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|After I first got my GTX670 on my old Q9550 system I was skeptical that a new CPU/MB/RAM would do much for me. This CPU proved me wrong big time. There's no comparison between the i5-3570K and my old Core 2 Quad CPU. This thing is lightning fast and overclocks great. I'm currently running mine at 4.5Ghz without any issues by just changing the multiplier. This CPU shouldn't be a bottleneck for quite some time to come. The price/performance ratio is definitely the sweet spot for a gaming system. Don't listen the naysayers about Ivy Bridge having heat problems. They do run hotter than Sandy Bridge but are also more efficient clock for clock and support newer technology. I haven't tried the integrated graphics yet but I've seen videos of people actually playing some modern games with it.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|i dont find this game challenging enough for myself. wish i hadnt downloaded it onto my kindle fire. sorry but its ok ut i like a challenge.
B0086700CM|5.0|tis a great game. encounters endless hours of awesomeness. With this game I feel as if I don't eve. need coffee to stay awake. its so addicting!!!!!!
B001LPWGE6|3.0|Read the books then watched the movie. Books were great. However the only similarity between the movie and the book was the name. Not sure where the movie plot came from but it surely wasn't from the book.<br />Read the book. Ditch the movie.
1594202842|4.0|Chua gives us an up close and personal look at \\"Chinese Parenting\\". I'd like to refer to this as emotional child abuse. Holy cow! This woman is definitely a piece of work. If this is the way all Chinese raise their children, a psychologist could make a fortune in China.<br /><br />By page 8 I knew that this had issues when she said that her children wouldn't have just any hobbies, such as crafts, which would lead them nowhere or playing the drums, which would lead to drug use. Seriously? It's no wonder that Chinese parents who use this method in the United States keep their parenting ways a secret. At the age of three, Chua's daughter does not play the piano the way Chua thinks she should (um, she's three???). Instead, the child bangs and smashes the keys, which infuriates Chua. To get Lulu to comply, she takes her to the back door, opens it, and tells her that she can't come in until she plays the way she wants her to play. The problem? It's twenty degrees outside!!! Well, Lulu takes her up on her threat and actually goes outside and refuses to come back in. The fact that Lulu would rather stand outside in the freezing cold than play the piano should have been a clue to Chua that this form of parenting wouldn't work with Lulu, but being the bull headed woman that she is, she didn't see it, or worse, just didn't care. In addition to this punishment, Chua would often threaten to withhold food from her children if they did not practice the violin (for Lulu) or piano (for Sophia). Really? What type of parent refuses to feed their child for not practicing? She would also call them names, telling them they were an embarrassment to themselves and her, and degrade them in all sorts of ways. Now, I can understand wanting your child to succeed, but to damage their psyche in the process? That's taking it too far.<br /><br />Finally about half way through the book, we get an insight into Chua. She finally admits that she is no good at enjoying life. She says that she always has a to-do list and doesn't enjoy relaxing on vacation. She even goes as far as bashing her American husband for believing that childhood should be fun for children. When the family does vacation, she forces the girls to practice for at least 2 hours a day and will go to whatever length necessary to find a venue for them to do so.<br /><br />Another insight into how selfish Chua is, is the chapter on her birthday. She is extremely upset with her husband because they are having dinner at what she considers a mediocre restaurant. Instead of being grateful that she has her health and her family, she is upset that her husband forgot to make reservations at the upscale, expensive restaurant she wanted to go to. To make matters worse, she once again, takes things out on the children. The girls give her hand written cards that they made that day. She then tells them that the cards aren't good enough and that she doesn't want them. She tells the girls that they MUST remake her birthday cards! I was absolutely appalled at this! This woman is so ungrateful!<br /><br />Finally, after years of fights and being treated like this, Lulu blows up around the age of 13. This actually happens in public while they are on vacation. It is a very small turning point, however, for Chua. The blowup causes her to allow Lulu to give up the violin if she so chooses, which she does, to an extent. She chooses to try tennis, which she ends up loving. But of course, even though she allowed her to choose another activity, Chua still can't fight the urge to stay out of this activity and begins to try and control the tennis just as she did with the violin.<br /><br />While the book was good, I found this woman's behavior quite disgusting and throughout most of the book I wanted to slap her silly. She is clearly selfish and I can't help but wonder if her behavior is a result of her own lack of self-esteem, despite being a successful Yale law professor. If you're a parent and have ever thought you werebeing too strict with your children, I would highly recommend this book. I would love for Lulu to write a book about 10 years from now reflecting on how her mother treated them.being too strict with your children, I would highly recommend this book. I would love for Lulu to write a book about 10 years from now reflecting on how her mother treated them.
1936891026|4.0|I've been reading this over the last ten days as I finish one life journey and prepare for the next great adventure. I think this book is brilliant. It's a no-holds-barred approach to creating art, words, your life. More than just tell you to \\"walk it off,\\" Steven Pressfield explains why resistance is making you sick, causing insomnia, driving addiction, keeping you fat, and stopping you from doing the thing you want to the most. It's not easy medicine, but it's a great read... and intensely motivating. As I prepare for my next journey, this has been a great motivation for me to set that course.

B005G5PPGS|4.0|Lewis yet again demonstrates that careful analysis of the data can lead to unfashionable views and methods which are nevertheless right. Finance and sport are no different in this regard. Truth ultimately triumphs over truthiness.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Well I've never written a review before, but I felt compelled to to in this case.<br />  I won't lie, the only reason I gave this book a try was because Emma Watson is starring in the film, and I was so excited to see the main actors of Harry Potter branching out. Regaurdless, this book sucked me in within the first few pages, and I ended up finishing it all at once in nine hours.<br />  The book is in the form of individual letters being sent to us, the reader, by a boy named Charlie starting his freshman year of high school. He keeps his location and full identity unknown to us, and adresses 'dear friend' in his letters. The story is a very real depiction of what its like to grow up, and doesn't sugar-coat it. Charlie goes through the ups and downs of high school at a rapid clip. Throughout (and especially in the beginning) Charlie maintains a sort of innocence that made it hard to buy into at first, he seems far too old to be oblivious to some of these things. But he is quickly exposed to everything from sex, drugs, and violence to crushes, homosexuality, and heartbreak. He learns the importance of 'participating' in life and being confident in yourself.<br />  Like I said, this is not a 'fake' book. The reality in coming of age is very serious here and there are some pretty graphic scenes, but I have to admire the author for using great suddle uses of language. For example, throughout the novel Charlie's letters become increasingly better punctuated and well written. However him being placed in an ADVANCED english class he had some pretty bad grammar skills to begin with, but this is a minor concern.<br />  The charecters for me where extremely relatable, but this may be that I'm at a similiar age and position in life as Charlie. I became more invested in these charecters than I have in a LONG time, so I know there will be people like myself out there who will fall in love with Charlie and his friends. You will laugh and possibly cry along with these peope living out thier lives. Although thats another thing. The charecters (especially Charlie) cry pleeenty in the book. It's a little difficult to sympathize with them after a few dozen times of sobbing, but there is still emotion to be felt. I know that Charlie's charecter is sensitive, so am I, but jeez…<br />  Overall The Perks of Being A Wallflower is one of (if not the) best novel I've ever read and if you like reading, you will probably enjoy this.
0300169787|5.0|This is such a beautiful book. The cover looks so wonderful and each page and color is so handsomely made. I bought this for my mother-in-law as a gift and she loved it. She keeps it on her antique coffee table and it just looks so great. I couldn't be more pleased.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it.... i want more. please let her write more from his point of view. i cant wait for more and/or the movie
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Only the second \\"Jack Reacher\\" I have not really enjoyed.<br />Too much padding and weak story line. Not what I have come to expect from Lee Child.
B001993Y2C|5.0|I had never watched an episode of the original Battlestar, nor had I watched an episode of this one when it was actually on the air.  I just bought the blu ray set after hearing how good the show was.  I am glad I did.<br /><br />Given what I said above I cannot really compare the two series.  I know that when this series was initially planned fans of the original series considered it almost a sacrilege.  I am honestly not sure if you were a fan of the original series how this one holds up.  My guess is by now you have already made that determination.  I really like the story that is presented in this series.  The human vs cylon, humans being enslaved, then eventually having to work with some of the cylons was presented extremely well.  There were a lot of twists in the story that could make it difficult to follow at times.  I definitely think watching the entire series from beginning to end without any break actually helped in that regard.<br /><br />I am also one who liked how the twist at the very end of the series worked out.  I am not going to spoil it here (even though most people who are reading this by now know how it turns out).  I managed to stay spoiler free and did not see it coming.  I thought it was creative and well done.  I have not really heard of many people being in the middle on how the series end.  Most I have heard either like it or hate it.<br /><br />Battlestar is a show that touches on a lot of subjects.  Religion, ethics, betrayal, love, prejudice and class systems are just a few of the topics the show delved into.  The acting was top notch, with a mix of well known actors and relative unknowns.  And then there was also the plus of lots of Tricia Helfer and Grace Park gratuitous nudity throughout, which was definitely not a bad thing.  This version of the set is not packaged all that well.  Some of the later ones have incorporated episode lists into the packaging to make it easier to follow.  Although I did not find it all that hard to figure out what the sequence was.  I definitely recommend the series for any fan, or someone who likes the sci-fi genre and have heard about how good the series is.re out what the sequence was.

B008PE9GSA|5.0|... for giving us an album of all the things we love about this band. \\"Gotsta Get Paid\\" is brilliant, taking a rap song, keeping the basic rap structure, but making it 100x more musical than most rap songs. God bless you, boys.  Billy Gibbons has long been the master of tone, groove, and phrasing, and there are \\"precious and few\\" other bands that care at all about that.  Rick Rubin knows not to lose that. Distorted sound?? Where it sounds like the tubes in the amp are about to explode?  That's Gibbons, and that's the whole point. You want clean tone, buy an Eric Clapton album. If it doesn't sound like it belongs on American Idol or The Voice, I guess some people just won't get it -- their loss.  I was not blown away by the two extra Best Buy songs.  Glad I've heard them (for the 11 cents difference), and every ZZ Top track has something interesting on it, at least for guitar players. But they're inferior to all the others on the \\"regular\\" release. It's a better album if you just stop on the wonderful, slinky, \\"Have Mercy\\".
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Well I must admit having Flipboard on my Kindle makes me feel rather edgy and \\"with it\\". I love the format. I think that being able to access as many news sources as possible makes it more likely for me to get information that is straight to the point and hopefully not twisted. I probably am practicing more of my wishful thinking yet I think not, the world news is geared to many different viewpoints and comes from many different sources, all verified, just not State side. I have enjoyed reading how many different cultures and countries are dealing with the economy, threats, gender issues and civil rights. Also how America is being treated and thought of is very interesting to me. It has been every educational and I recommend it highly. The photos are beautiful.

B005FISBV2|4.0|Dexter's sixth season is not the best season that they have produced. That said, it is still Dexter and that means that it is heads and tails better than anything else on TV.<br /><br />We do not subscribe to Showtime so it is an annual tradition to buy the latest season every August and view it from beginning to end over a period of two days. This sixth season was no different and as enjoyable as ever. I cannot pretend to be a professional TV critic but I know what I like and this latest season of Dexter is, again, wonderfully sick and twisted. Michael C Hall IS Dexter and his ex wife who plays his \\"'sister\\" is equally talented.This latest season is a great place to invest your entertainment dollar as the entertainment value is built in. So--- here I sit waiting for next August so I can do it again.<br /><br />Also- just as an aside- the Amazon price- especially for the Blu Ray version of this latest season is the lowest I've found anywhere. If you have ever been a Dexter fan, this latest season will not disappoint. If you've never been exposed to it----- where have you been? Dexter will- literally- kill you!
B0081L37Z0|3.0|I didn't have high expectations for this film, just sit back and enjoy, and that is exactly what you are going to get if you are looking for a movie filled with sophomoric type humor.
B00899EOIS|5.0|Love this show and my daughter and I watch it together every week.  It's definitely worth buying.  We can't get enough! :)
0345803493|3.0|The characters are growing. It's as if they are changing places. Lots of repeating of the same descriptive words. Fifty is interesting as always. I don't like him broken on his knees. These are the books you hate to love, but I've read two of them so on to the third. I still don't see what all the hype is about. It is fun to sit back and wonder who is brave and sexy enough in Hollywood to pull Christens character off on the big screen.

B0068RHGJM|5.0|I've been a long time fan of Nightwish and was really excited about the album after hearing the song \\"Storytime.\\" In my opinion, this is one of their best albums to date. Each song is a treat to listen to, and I highly recommend this album to anybody who likes good music. The album is a given for anybody who is a fan of Nightwish.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Just challenging enough without going so far as to frustrate you. It's gradual increase lets you learn the process then once you get to the hard it you are forced to think outside the obvious.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Ok ny fellow fantasy loving friends, I have never written a review for Amazon though I have read tons of books in this genre.  But I had to make an exception because Anthony Ryan's story was pretty awesome.  I was hooked from the moment I started reading and was engaged all the way through.  Some readers have compared Raven's Shadow  to the Name of the Wind by Rothfus and it is very good but I wouldn't say that good:) I still gave it five stars for:<br />1) great world building<br />2) great price<br />3)  epic fantasy without many of the old clichés.<br /><br />Way to go Mr. Ryan I look forward to the next book!<br /><br />Peace out.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Let's be brutally honest, folks:  Kristen Stewart may have achieved \\"movie star\\" status, but she's definitely a mediocre actress with a limited range, relying on soulful looks and lovestruck TWILIGHT fans to validify her screen leading roles--a media fixture whose future impact will most likely fade when the vampire saga breathes its last!  Charlize Theron on the other hand is mesmerizing as the evil Ravenna.  When Theron's on screen, this movie takes fire and you can't take your eyes off her.  Her Oscar-winning stature is not denigrated in an otherwise average film.<br />SNOW WHITE is sumptuous to view, capturing the grim fairy tale ambience effectively.  James Newton Howard's score is excellent and the effects are noteworthy.  Using noted actors such as Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Toby Jones, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, etc.  was controversial and offended many SGA card carrying dwarves, but the CGI transformations are brilliantly done and its hard to fault or criticize this casting decision.  Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman is requisite hero sturdiness, but nothing outstanding.<br />In essence, this is Charlize's movie and makes me wonder how a better Snow White would've made a much better film.  Recommended mainly to bask in Theron's scene-stealing queen.

B004PVKFR8|4.0|I never buy albums based on one hit song. At this point, I know better. So, one day at work, I really wanted to hear Sail and I typed it into Pandora.<br />Over the next few hours I heard about half the album and was completly shocked. Not only is Sail a misrepresentation (if you're one of those people) of the album but, the album is...interesting! How often do you hear interesting music that you were introduced to by a pop station?! Thank you Pandora and, thank you Awol. This album is going to keep me occupied for the next few months.
B0087HT36U|3.0|Pretty good, almost addicting. I like the added challenge of don't kill the civilians. Some levels too easy; other levels seem to have only one way to solve, and so you can't get anything but gold crown. But other levels offer enough challenge to want to come back and play them again. Seems like I have to review to get to cowboys levels, otherwise four stars.

B0054VVRBQ|5.0|I bought this thing not really sure if it were the right product for my 2009 MB Pro, but the price was good enough to gamble a bit. It fit perfectly into the slot and is completely hidden from sight (and snags, for that matter). I took the mini-sd from my digital camera and transferred the pics that were on it. The speed was amazing, several times faster than hooking the camera up with the USB data cable. Frankly, I was amazed. If you need to put lots of pictures or videos onto your laptop, this is the way to go !!!! 5 stars !
0441013597|5.0|The storyline is thick with intrigues, and sub-plots within sub-plots. The character development is superb and very believable, providing depth to the political planetary conflict between the competing royal houses.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert: I thought the failed Coup d'état formulated by the na-Baron Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, who concealing a tiny poison needle-dart just below the skin in the upper thy of a drugged slave boy, that was offered as a human sextoy to his homosexual uncle the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, was creatively exquisite.<br /><br />The fight scene at the end (without giving it away) was epic, but I'm sorry to say, the books in the series that came after this one were hurried and most unworthy of Dune.<br /><br />Anyone who reads my other reviews, knows I am one critical bastard, and seldom give a book five stars unless it's deserving. This is perhaps the best science fiction book ever written in American history (I read it at least three times). There is not much else to say, other than purchase this book, you will not be disappointed, even if you do not like science fiction.<br /><br />I highly recommend that at this exact moment you purchase this book. I am certain you won't be let down.
0345803485|1.0|I read this book out of curiosity - I read a lot and in my opinion the level of writing was very poor and the characters unbelieavable and shallow.  I read it in a day like reading a comic really nothing toughing Maive Binchey (my favourite) the sex was not shocking just laughable really a real dissappointment/  Will not be reading the other two in the triology and cannot believe this is such a bestseller

B005LAJ16I|1.0|Let's start with the preposterous. Oh, where to begin?<br />Take the idea one.  Brody goes home the same day he arrives stateside.  Come on, now.  Are we to accept that a Marine who miraculously survived eight years captive al quaeda won't actually be debriefed for weeks if not months in a secure environment while receiving medical care and deep psych-eval?  That Sgt. Brody would be fending off reporters in his front yard and freaking out in his closet mere days after release, well, that's just too much to expect your viewers swallow.  Especially when the guy looks like a zombie.  Come on, people.<br />And the signals.  Sheesh! What is he signalling while standing next to the VP?  \\"have left captivity, standby for further orders?\\"  \\"I'm the guy you have been waiting for\\"? \\"Meet at HardRock Cafe at six\\"?? Duh!<br />And what's his hurry?  Active the very day he returns?  Give me a break!! It  gets even worse, but that should be fair warning.<br />Now for the dangerous.<br />This show justifies and normalizes an American's total loss of privacy in his own home.  Brody, going potty, Brody mauling his wife, Brody having nightmares, yelling at his kids, experiencing deep psychological anguish -- ALL OF BRODY AND HIS FAMILY -- is on display, noted and analyzed. On display, noted and analyzed mind you, as the result the authorized escapade of a drug-addicted obsessive-compulsive with CIA clearance who also looks like a hot surfer chick.<br />Make of this last point what you will, but take note: this movie is a product of the fascist state of Zionist Israel, Occupied Palestine.  This motive behind this drivel is to expose impressionable people to New American Century propaganda in the form of a soap opera.  Homeland is designed and intended to lull people into accepting the US and Israeli governments' pursuit of Total Informational Awareness.  Through the eyes of sympathetic characters, who happen to be sexy, the dedicated audience of Homeland learns to see TIA as absolutelynecessary for our safety. \\"See!\\" that ruthless al quaeda even turned a guy like Brody!  No one is safe.  The sex and drugs and consumerism is just a movie prop., no different than a movie-prop cavalry fort or a movie-prop battleship.<br />Unplug this menace to society.<br />(Let's see how long this review stays up past 16Sep12)
B006AZZPCM|1.0|so I really wanted to give this app a 5 star rating. however after reading several reviews I saw tons of people with the same problem as me and no fixes for it online! its an amazing app and I loved it until it had an &quot;update&quot;! I click yes and it just takes me back to the store. no update and no more downloading or watching videos!
B007VUA7VO|1.0|Installing this made my phone crash over and over again.  I had to reset the entire device.  It seems to be the most \\"unsafe\\" app I've ever encountered.  Just seeing it on my list of apps scares me.

B0087HT36U|4.0|found this game by chance and now I can't put it down. it easy ti aim but not to easy. good graphic. and very additive!
B0087HT36U|4.0|This game is fundamentally sound and offers numerous hours of replay ability. The graphics are great, the game runs smoothly, and overall Siege Hero is a well designed fun game. The only problems I can see with the game are the sound effects, which could use some work. The sounds are pretty lackluster in comparison to everything else. The physics are very well done with only a few hang ups here and there. At times the blocks, wood, and ice can get suspended in midair when there is nothing stopping them from falling more.<br /><br />Keep it up developers, and everyone else give this game a try!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love getting and sharing all the yummy recipes. I can sit for hours searching for new fun crafts for my kids.
034580404X|3.0|The story, plot etc. is fairly good, but NOBODY could have that much SEX.  Almost 'soft porn' in subject matter and explicit DETAILS of the sex between the two main characters.  On a scale of 1-10 I would give it a 5 or 3 stars, which is what I rated the 3 books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|this is the first novel I have read by Gillian Flynn. The book was impossible to put down. It had so many twists and turns that were totally unexpected. The characters were complex, flawed and made for an interesting read. The ending leaves you wondering???? I would recommend the book. Hope it becomes a movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My son downloaded it and now I'm hooked!  Great for building spatial thinking and loads of fun.  Easy to start.  Harder to master.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|Expressionless and always whispering her lines, K Stewart is miscast in this role as she plays most of the role as somebody who doesn't want to talk and who is hard to root for because she is expressionless and doesn't respond to any conflict. The effects are over the top and, while visually cool to look at, did nothing to add to the movie. Something about the entire film was cold, distant and shallow. Charlize Theron's evil queen was the only thing that created some fire in this movie.
0385344228|5.0|I read this book and then had my entire family read it. My mom's book club chose it for their list this year.<br /><br />The story was very thought-provoking to me. How would I react if my child was accused of a horrific crime? What if I thought he was guilty, what if I thought he was innocent?  What if I was wrong?  I hope to never be in this situation.<br /><br />This is a fantastic read. I highly recommend it.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|Whoa! The macguffin is, well, whatever, but Saoirse Ronan (tough one to spell) is quite a new & interesting talent (to me) while Cate Blanchett, the woman of a thousand faces, (perhaps the best actress currently working in movies), is always a treat to watch.<br /><br />Eric Bana fine; cinematography, direction; all on a high level.<br /><br />yeah plot holes, but that's not what it's about; it's about Saoirse Ronan and the emergence of a compelling screen presence in a beautiful movie to watch, where the mystery of our existence (Who are we really? Where do we come from?) is allowed to breath.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|The movie had great plot, character development and interaction. However, I was very disappointed that it really had no satisfying ending...it had NO ENDING!! I assume the director and producer did this on purpose, but it did not make me happy. I felt cheated. Still a very good flick.

B006LSZECO|5.0|It was so hard to put this book down.  Just when you think you have it all figured out you are in for a tantilizing change in events that will blow you away!

B008BRC6NS|4.0|Jennifer Lopez's Dance Again - The Hits Deluxe Edition consists of 14 songs from her previous albums plus two new songs which are \\"Dance Again\\" and \\"Goin' In\\". The songs are \\"I'm Into You\\" and \\"On the Floor\\" from \\"Love?\\", released in 2011, the last one being her comeback hit of last year. Included from the 2001 \\"J.Lo\\" we have the big hit \\"Love Don't Cost A Thing\\", \\"J.Lo\\" is Jennifer's most succesful album so far, it was expected to have more hits from that album on this compilation. Anyway, there are remixes of two songs from the J.Lo album that were released on her remix album \\"J to tha L-O\\" in 2002, they are \\"Ain't Funny\\" and \\"I'm Real\\", both the Murder Remix versions featuring Ja Rule, which were smash hits back then. From her 1999 debut album \\"On the 6\\", have been taken \\"If you had my love\\", the big hit \\"Waiting for Tonight\\", \\"Feelin' So Good\\" that is titled as being a remix but it actually is the album version, and as a bonus track on the deluxe edition there is the track \\"Let's Get Loud\\" which is definitely not one of her best songs. I think there are too much songs from the \\"On the 6\\" album here, since this is not her most popular album. From the 2005 \\"Rebirth\\" we have \\"Get Right\\", that didn't make a huge success but is one of my favorites of her career and definitely the best song from \\"Rebirth\\". From the nice 2002 \\"This is me... then\\" have been included the smash hit \\"Jenny from the block\\" and as a bonus track \\"All I Have\\", which in my opinion should be in the main tracklist and not as a bonus.  From her least succesful album \\"Brave\\" of 2007 we get \\"Do it well\\" which was a flop as a single but has a nice videoclip. Also was added \\"Qué Hiciste\\", a song from her spanish album \\"Como ama una mujer\\" of 2007. It is missing \\"Play\\" from J.Lo album, it is a very nice track that deserved a spot here.  And exclusively on the deluxe edition you get a DVD with 11 videoclips from the same tracks available on the CD, which is a nice addition to the ones that already haveher video compilation \\"The Reel Me\\" released in 2003.  The booklet has a beautiful design with images from different times of her career, printed on a high quality glossy paper. Overall I recommend this compilation to JLo's fans and to everyone that don't have all of the albums and want to listen to a compilation that comprises all her career.
B007VTVGAQ|2.0|this album can best be described as \\"arty.\\" lyrically, this is on par with all of her other stuff, but musically, this feels like fiona sitting at a piano alone and randomly coming up with tunes. there is no powerful hook or chorus to any of the songs- it is not the kind of album you play and scream out the lyrics to. instead, it's a quiet soliloquy. it is more of an extension of \\"extraordinary machine\\" than of her previous two albums, but unlike \\"extraordinary machine\\", this one is lacking the direction of a strong producer. instead, the tune kind of just hums along without ever getting too big or interesting.<br />all in all, i'm really disappointed, given that i am such a huge fiona fan and always look forward to her albums. hopefully, jon brion (the producer of \\"when the pawn...\\", my fave fiona album) will return for her next album.

0385344333|4.0|After reading the reviews for \\"A Wanted Man\\", I was almost scared to read the book itself, but I'm glad I did.  It was suspenseful and it certainly held my interest.  Admittedly, it took awhile for the action to kick in - Reacher seemed to be half asleep and not quite as sharp as usual, but he finally pulled himself together.<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is the best book Lee Child has ever written, but, hey, it's Reacher.  Even a tired Reacher is better than none.<br /><br />Now, the question is:  will he ever reach Virginia?  I'm hoping so.

B00881VLCE|4.0|I like the way you can choose how many pieces you want to play. Both adults and kids can do the same puzzle,  or you can decide if you want a relaxing or challenging game. There is also the option to have the pieces rotated or not. You can download more puzzles, some are free and some are not, but the selection is very good. The only caveat I found was when I downloaded some puzzles - dragons, for free, and Halloween, for $1.99 - I did one of the dragon puzzles and the next time I went to use the app, the dragon pictures were gone! The Halloween pictures, which I paid for, never did appear in the app.

B000C8VE14|5.0|The first time I heard Arctic Monkeys almost 7 years ago, my first reaction was 'ehh'. The second time I listened to Arctic Monkeys, I finally understood the hype. Now they are probably one of my favorite bands ever, especially after seeing them live. Whatever People Say I Am That's What I Am Not is probably one of the greatest debut albums of all time. The majority of the songs are hard hitting, but never cross the line of being too hard or loud. I don't think I can necessarily pick a favorite song on the album, but all the released singles are a great place to start if discovering them for the first time.<br /><br />The vinyl transfer is really good too. There is a lot more depth to the recording than there is on the standard mp3. I wouldn't say it's the best modern transfer to vinyl, but not the best. There is only so much that can be done with digitally engineered music when moving it to an analog medium.

B007R3BFR0|4.0|Garbage's first new album in years did not disappoint at all. Not Your Kind of People reminds me of the Garbage we all knew and loved from the 90s. The first half of the album feels stronger than the second half with Automatic Systematic Habit, Blood For Poppies, Control, and the title track Not Your Kind Of People being the strongest. The title track is probably one of the most interesting as it is very melodic in nature.<br /><br />The vinyl was incredible as well. When a band that knows something about audio engineering releases an album, it will sound great on vinyl. The vinyl also comes with a download for the mp3s.

There were actually a couple of times that I shouted \\"Oh My God\\" while I was reading it because I was so stunned by the events. I wasn't crazy about the ending, but I was hungry for more, so I bought another book, Dark Places, by the same author. Again, I was pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns that the author wended through the story. I totally recommend both books to anyone who likes a story that keeps you thinking to the end.

B007RP4D5Y|5.0|In reading some of the other reviews, one point that should be remembered is that this recording belongs to Chris Potter equally as it does to Pat Metheny. True, Pat Metheny's name has the largest font for marketing reasons, but the band is called the Unity Band,<br />not the Pat Metheny Unity Band. What I'm getting at is that I hear it as a great band recording where all four members deserve<br />equal credit.<br /><br />With that said, I've always admired Chris Potter with Dave Holland's Big Band. He has such a clear and strong tone to his<br />playing. And when I heard he was joining forces with Metheny, I sensed<br />something very good would result. And this recording goes well beyond my expectations. I've never really thought of Metheny<br />as a \\"Jazz\\" musician. But when he does decide to play in the vicinity of this genre he seems to always have something fresh to add to the conversation. And that seems very true in this case.<br /><br />Finally I love the rhythm section in Antonio Sanchez and Ben Williams. Their true name should be Unity All-Star Band. Can't wait to hear them live!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read almost half of the book, but I stopped because it's boring, not to say bad written. There are some hot parts (few pages, though). You can find better ones free in the web.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Wonderful old photographs tied to some rather peculiar tales and bizarre children - that is what makes this book stand out among the crowd.  The stories were inventive and entertaining.  There was some animal cruelty that I didn't like reading about, and it was not necessary to telling a good story, so that was a negative for me.  There is quite a bit of darkness in this book.  One of the children was not only peculiar, he seemed downright creepy.  The time-travel, time-loop thing has been overdone but it is done fairly well in this story.  The protagonist sometimes seemed too mature for his age, sounded more like his potential adult self than his current teen self.  Given all that, it was an enjoyable light read.<br /><br />Because of the photographs, this book might lose some of its impact on some e-readers, I don't know how well it would work, but it was fine on my Kindle Fire.  One handwritten letter was a bit hard to read, but other than that, I had no issues with reading on a Fire instead of a printed copy.

0439023521|4.0|I was so afraid to read this book, I was afraid it would be disturbing. I mean, what mother of 3 adolescents wants to read a book about kids that age killing each other?<br /><br />So we saw the movie first. At that time, my teenage daughter had read the series. She loved the books, and the movie, but said the movie was different.<br /><br />Now that I've read the book, I don't really see what she meant. It thought the movie followed the book to a T.<br /><br />I also now realize that this isn't just gratuitous violence, this story is a political commentary about the dangers of a government with too much power.<br /><br />The writing is very simplistic, but the story is very suspenseful and I often had trouble falling asleep after reading.<br /><br />If it were just for me, I'd give it 3 stars, but for adolescent kids I give it 4.<br /><br />Off to read book 2!

B007L6VQHW|3.0|LAWLESS, the second collaboration between Director John Hillcoat and Writer/Composer/All-Around Weird Dude Nick Cave, is a film that has just about everything working in its favor: It has a trememdous cast, some excellent and vibrant performances, some crackling scenes of dialogue and some beautiful scene composition. So why can't I get past everything that it doesn't have that it needed to put it on the same level as their first collaborative effort, an amazing and little-seen film called THE PROPOSITION?<br /><br />LAWLESS, based on a book of non-fiction called \\"The Wettest County In The World\\", is based during the later years of Prohibition in Franklin County, Virginia and based around the Bondurant brothers, who became a little less than folk-heroes and a little more than outlaws during those years. They, like many of the families in Franklin County, are Moonshiners and they're pretty good at it. The eldest, Howard (Jason Clarke, most recognizable for his recent turn in the excellent but short-lived THE CHICAGO CODE) is a strong-armed but dull-witted man who samples a little too much of his own product. The middle child is Forrest (Tom Hardy, best known for just about every other film in the last two years), who is something of a legend amongst the community already for being \\"immortal\\", by surviving the illness that killed their parents when he was just a boy. Jack (Shia LaBeouf, discarding most of his annoying mannerisms here) is \\"the runt of the litter\\", skinny and scared, but brainy and ambitious and anxious to prove his worth in the family business to Forrest who really runs the show. They are put upon by a Federal agent or \\"Special Deputy\\" named Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce, who also starred in THE PROPOSITION) who is looking not to clean things up Eliot Ness style, but looking to make a buck by shaking down the locals for protection money. This leads the local law to side, at least for a while, with Rakes, as Jack and his best friend Cricket (Dane Dehaan) look to sell their goods to a big-time gangster (Gary Oldman) and also romance a young preacher's daughter (Mia Wasikowska). Another unusual visitor comes to town in the visage of Maggie (Jessica Chastain), looking to escape the hustle of the big city and soon finds herself caring for Forrest in a way she never would have expected.<br /><br />The film's biggest strength is also one of its main failings, and that's the setting. The incredibly rural setting of a Prohibition-era drama is something that is not seen very often, because the majority of them take place in the big cities (although a film like Sam Mendes' ROAD TO PERDITION is partially set in the boonies), and that's something that a director like Hillcoat and a writer like Cave would feel like they would want to immerse the viewer into that world, but we only catch glimpses. It seems like the setting is more incidental rather than a necessary part of the storytelling. Everyone in it is good with really three stand-out performances: Tom Hardy is excellent as the soft-spoken but deadly Forrest who acts as the patriarch for his brothers; Guy Pearce is amazing and chameleon-like as the needlessly sadistic and sweet-scented Rakes who is trying to be the city gent, but is too brutal and cruel to ever be accepted as such. Every scene of his drips with menace. Also standing out here is Dane Dehaan (wonderful in the brilliant little-seen gem CHRONICLE) as Cricket, the resident mechanical genius and hero-worshipping child whose vulnerability is extended beyond that of a cliche. LaBoeuf takes his time with his character in building it and turns in a very commendable performance in easliy his most complex role yet. The rest of the cast work best with what they have but what they have isn't much. Mia Wasikowska has a wonderful scene with LaBoeuf as he takes her out for a drive, but that's really the extent of her character as something for the young Jack to long for. Jason Clarke is the most short-changed of the Bondurants here, being portrayed as a drunk and a thug, but little else. Gary Oldman has little more than a cameo in this film, and from a completely subjective point of view, I wanted more because there was something there to really allow for him to have fun and cut loose like we had seen in years past. Sadly the one player here that is the most marginalized is Jessica Chastain. She's an actress that will undoubtedly have an Oscar in her hand before the decade is out, and she does some really good work here, but her character of Maggie is very much the weary and damaged madonna/whore for Forrest, and very little else.<br /><br />Another real problem is the pacing of the film. It's not that it's uneven; it's that it's too fast. This film moves along at such a brisk pace that at its little over 100-minute runtime seems too brief for a film of this type. I felt like I was being rushed out of the theater rather than being invited in to experience something unusual and lyrical, like Hillcoat and Cave's THE PROPOSITION. That was a film that took the Western out of the \\"Old West\\" and placed it in Austrailia's Outback, and it invited the viewer to really soak in all the elements of the environment the film was set in, which were strange and wonderful and terrible. This is honestly the first time in a while where I felt that a longer runtime would have benefitted the film, particularly from a character standpoint.<br /><br />LAWLESS, while being beautiful to look at and well-performed, is sadly lacking heart and soul that could have easily elevated this film to greater heights. But in all fairness, when LAWLESS works, it works really well, and that does happen slightly more often than not.<br /><br />3/5 Stars.s here, being portrayed as a drunk and a thug, but little else.

B00003ZKRM|4.0|These renditions of the Sibelius symphonies are not my top favorites, either individually or as a set. For a complete cycle, my prime choices are Davis with the Boston Symphony and Segerstam with the Helsinki Philharmonic: Two very different interpretations, but I like both perspectives and don't care to box myself in. Barbirolli's recordings to me lack the polish of the Davis/BSO set and the analytic intensity of the Segerstam/HPO, but as at least one other reviewer has noted, they do carry the weight of Barbirolli's measured, mature introspection. In addition, there are more extras than either Davis or Segerstam offer: Finlandia, Karelia Suite, Pohjola's Daughter, Valse triste, Rakastava, Romance in C, Scenes historiques, Pelleas and Melisande Suite, and two segments from the Lemminkainen Suite. Some have criticized these performances as horribly slow, and one reviewer called Barbirolli's performance of Pohjola's Daughter the worst ever. I agree that the rendition lacks intensity, but for me a sense of majesty comes to the fore instead. As with the split between Davis and Segerstam in the symphonies, it's a different perspective, and one that I can appreciate as well as its complement, depending on my mood. As set of both Sibelius' symphonies and many orchestral works, this is a fine collection that one can't go wrong with, though for the symphonies alone I still stand by the Davis and Segerstam.
0425263908|1.0|I bought this after reading reviews online and was extremely disappointed. It appeared way too similar to the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. I enjoyed reading the Fifty Shades trilogy and found I could not put it down. Not the case with this book. It took me a really long time to get into this book and it just wasn't interesting enough to grab my attention. I ready the Fifty Shades trilogy in 1-1/2 weeks and this book alone took me 2 months to get through.
0812993292|3.0|I wanted to like this book so much more than I did. The premise is interesting, and a good part of the character's journey opens up more and more of his true self. He has so many regrets in his life that you wonder if he is journeying to Queenie Hennessey, or journeying away from his own life. His wife has maintained a cruel separateness for twenty years, related to an occurrence in his son's life that is elucidated in the last section of the novel. He regrets so very much about his relationship with his son, but it's never really clear why his son bears so much scorn for his father. And the addition of multiple pilgrims about two-thirds of the way through really detracted from the flow of the story for me. All of the issues and mysteries are resolved in a clear and believable manner by the end of the novel, but overall I was left with a frustrated dissatisfaction, because their resolution didn't alter the fact that he and his wife had spent so many unhappy years that even if their remaining lives are happy, they both had lost so much.

I think it sets women's liberation back years and years.  All it was was kinky sex, master slave stuff over and over.  In today's world it would be like having a rich stalker following you.  No thanks!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I was completely surprised how much this book was able to capture me and reel me into its world. At first it was a little hard to keep up with all the different characters, the switching between time periods, and all the tents.. but once i got that down i was able to really get swept away. The author did a wonderful job of developing all of the characters and keeping everything tied together well!!!  If anyone is looking for a book that can take their mind off everyday trial and errors this book is for you!! The magic from the book permeates through the pages and enchants anyone who surrenders to its will... definitely a book to put on your to read list!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|LoVE Jack Reacher and Lee Child. - at least to date.  I've read all the Reacher books-some twice - and this book was just boring - the end was sooooo predictable I lost track of what I was reading.  I work too hard for my money to waste it on drivel like this.  But if Tom Cruise is now supposed to be the face of Jack Reacher then who cares anyway.  So disappointing.  Wow (first book review ever).

0345803485|5.0|I purchased all three ebooks without reading the reviews.  I didn't want snobs clouding my judgement.  First person narratives are not choice of narrative.  I do like to keep an open mind, though.  After having read all three, I decided to read the reviews.  I had no idea there were so many snobs.  First of all, it's a story about people.  People who have serious issues.  Granted, I didn't like the whole situation with \\"Mrs. Robinson\\".  This is a story about a relationship.  So what if the reader doesn't go through or say things that the characters do?  It's called fiction!  The epilogue was beautiful.  In book one, Ana shows that she is a very sheltered, very young adult.  As I read her thoughts, I realize that I do think some (not all, of course) of those things.  Christian is a fantasy.  Fiction!  Hello!  I've read reviews that made me roll my eyes.  People, get over yourselves.  It's a great love story, filled with the insecurities of a new love.  People, real people at least, have to fight with them all their lives, or until they finally reach that point where they realize they can let go.  For the sex scenes, I've read quite a few reviews that call them unrealistic or unimaginable.  If that's that case, I'm sorry for you.  They're fun.  For those that are so angry at this series, you need to relax and get laid.  Chill out.  They are three books for those with an open mind and heart.<br /><br />My advice to those that are thinking of reading this series is, DO IT!  Get out of yourselves for awhile.  You won't regret it.  Keep your mind and heart open.  Don't listen to the snobs.
B004UID2LC|2.0|used to work just fine...after a few &quot;upgrades&quot; nothing works...can't download videos/mp3s...can't even how the videos....wtf?! really upsetting because I used to love this app.
B004UID2LC|2.0|after updating this app it wont play or download anymore. its keeps saying 'can not play this file,please check current connection quality' ????????????????? why??????????????
B000I9YWDO|4.0|Come on. Who doesn't know this movie is worth watching over and over and over. It's awesome and I need at least 20 words for this review. I did it! AND THIS MOVIE ROCKS!
B0065IZEE8|5.0|I had never heard of this movie before, but it really was fantastic! Great acting and story, and it will certainly leave an impression on your heart!
B008EQIEWS|5.0|A must rent or buy for Mythology lovers, like me! It keeps you tied to the couch for the whole movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i like it does all the basic functions correctly and it can show you what youve typed in before. great tool if you have to look back to what youve already typed get it!
B007C4ZJ3K|5.0|Finally an action movie that doesn't have only gun fights. Say good bye to the quick cuts through the action and hello to actual fighting. MMA fighter Gina Carano is superb in the lead. All of the supporting actors bring great performances. Watch this movie!
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is like a way to wean me away from Angry Birds.  I can't put it down.  Bring on a new level.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is a lot of fun though a bit addicting once you start playing trying to improve the score. It is wholesome & entertaining for all ages.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Great movie.  We have watched it at least five times now.  Great story.  Can not wait for the next one to be filmed.
B004GKMV16|1.0|For me this book is just too slow and ponderous.  There are some excellent sections with light, snappy dialogue but then long sections of almost historical text.  It has some interesting historical perspectives - perhaps it never sorts out if it is a historical textbook or a narrative.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|The $5 price tag was a bit steep.  I had purchased the color version of CrossMe first. I liked it so much that I was willing to pay the price for this one.<br /><br />I have spent many hours solving the puzzles.  The software occasionally gets stuck.  I had to power down the Kindle Fire and completely reset it a few times.  I was necessary to fish through the menu to find the puzzle that I was completing.  The inconvenience is minimal.  I would highly recommend this product.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of my all-time favorite books.  Its originality and symbolism gives it a place in any reader's mind and heart.  A fantastic read with suspense and adventure in surplus.  One of the great litarery masterpieces of the new millennia.
B000KG499M|5.0|I bought this to hold my Deathscythe Hell version EW. It's a pretty sturdy stand and it offers a wide range of movement and lengths. You do have to build it just like a Gundam because it comes in runners but once assembled it's an excellent stand for 1/100 scale Gundams. I haven't tried anything smaller but I doubt it would be a problem other than the stand looking a little too big. I would highly recommend it for winged Gundams or those with balance issues such as big backpacks or rockets.<br /><br />For those new to Gundams and badly needing information like I did my first time feel free to reply to this review and I'll try to get in contact with you as soon as possible. I'll be glad to help as soon as I can get to it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game. It is my go-to game on my commute home. I hate getting to the end and hope the games keep getting developed!
B007Z9RAX4|3.0|The movie was good, plot was good, had some nice surprises.  Interesting... tempo..?  The violence was just a little too real life for me.  I just can't get on board with a movie where a guy jumps on top of a girl and starts pounding on her face... too much.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These were very good books. I couldn't put them down. I have read all three of them twice and cannot wait to read them again. It's definitely not all about bdsm, there is far more to it then that but you do have to be a little open minded to read this. I do not suggest reading it around your parents or anyone close to you! I blushed a little when reading it lol :)
B007DIQC90|4.0|An easy album to like with shades of Bjork, Cranberries, Arcade Fire, etc. Very of-the-moment with it's choral emphasis. Not super challenging, but nevertheless, worth listening to repeatedly. 3.5 - 4 stars.
B0087HT36U|1.0|it sucks to have to rate this to play the last level I dont revew games anyway i i i i i i
B002BJGYU8|5.0|The second season of the show is more of the same perfection as the first. Storylines evolve, and this show demonstrates its smarts by playing out storylines over a season instead of over a couple of episodes.
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|Outstanding ! we enjoyed it so much we purchased the second season.. High quality visuals.. great acting.. so believeable.. it's more like peeping in on the characters, than watching a dvd..
B005LAII6M|2.0|\\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" has a pretty decent opening. You see the final battle of the last movie and its aftermath play backwards and in slow-motion as the opening credits roll. There's no dialogue and it's very straightforward. It makes you wish the entire movie was done this way since it would be a lot more enjoyable. Alice eventually narrates a recap of the first four movies and then you see that same battle play forwards and in real time. It's a bit redundant and feels twice as long as it is.<br /><br />The action seems to be slightly better than it was in \\"Afterlife,\\" but the slow-motion is as pointless as ever and the fight sequences become more and more repetitive the longer they are. The longest fight sequence is in this extended hallway where Alice fights a horde of zombies with a gun and a chain. There's some cool choreography in it, but it quickly becomes stale as Alice does the same flip kick move at least three or four times in the span of two minutes. There are a few interesting perspective shots like when you're right behind a zombie as Alice blows their brains out and the splatter goes all over the camera. The 3D still isn't fully utilized though and isn't worth the extra money for the handful of shots that actually try to use the effect.<br /><br />What makes matters worse is that the acting is still so stiff and rigid. Sienna Guillory kind of ruins things for everybody as her line delivery is pretty terrible. Everyone has a lack of facial expressions or emotions though. During an outbreak of this caliber where the world has nearly ended, shoving your emotions aside for a certain period of time is understandable. There are bigger tasks at hand, but there's bound to be some sort of psychological and emotional damage along the way especially five movies in.<br /><br />Alice alone has gone through so much with the loss of so many friends and loved ones, having and not having superhuman abilities, and being cloned to serve Umbrella's needs. If you went through this, wouldn't you have a moment where you finally broke down once you were alone or tried to sleep or whatever since it's obviously a lot to put on one person's shoulders? Nobody ever has that revelation. Every character is so busy trying to look like a bad ass and looking dramatically at the camera in slow motion to make time for anything resembling human emotion.<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" does feel like a miniscule improvement over \\"Afterlife,\\" but should still be considered overkill for a franchise that has already run its course. What's the point of cloning Alice's closest friends if they're just going to suffer the same fate in similar fashion? On one hand, it's kind of a throwback to the movies that came before it. But on the other hand, the logical one, it just seems really stupid overall.<br /><br />For some reason, people are still excited about this franchise as \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" was the number one movie in the country its opening weekend. Despite being the second movie of the franchise to be shot in 3D, the 3D effects are underwhelming while most of the special effects are done in front of a green screen and stand out like a sore thumb (or a green one). With its poor acting, unnecessary use of slow motion, repetitive fight scenes, and a story structure that's been exactly the same since the first movie, there's no telling why so many people love this franchise unless people are just a sucker for seeing Milla Jovovich dressed in leather and kicking the crap out of the undead.ent through this, wouldn't you have a moment where you finally broke down once you were alone or tried to sleep or whatever since it's obviously a lot to put on one person's shoulders?

0307960471|3.0|I was quite excited to be able to read an advance copy of Jo Nesbo's latest book. I quite enjoyed \\"The Snowman.\\" This one focuses on the drug trade in Oslo, and it didn't find it as compelling as \\"The Snowman.\\" For one thing, Harry Hole was the only character I really liked. I kind of liked Rakel, and the other characters ranged from icky to annoying. It took me a while to get into it, then I had to force myself to plod on. The last 100 pages or so do go by quickly, and are the best part of the book.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I have never seen a movie as meaningless and stupid by any point of view as this one. The movie and book's success has probably much to do with an incredibly pathetic and silly view of generational conflict, and it does not depose in favour of American teenagers. I suggest American teenagers to read the original version of Pinocchio.<br /><br />The book and the movie should be strictly forbidden to people older than 16 years old.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app it doesn't have stupid pop ups and it never crashes as an on the budget college student its pretty useful to have
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This one took a while to grow on me but it has picked up wonderfully in some brilliantly typical King Fashion. I love the concept of time travel and its potential impact on the current timelines. The moral implications are incredible and King has really out done himself here.<br /><br />Bravo!
B0058VW36U|5.0|this app works grate on the kindle fire &#9733;plus its really fun I aways wanted this app its not to easy or really really really hard.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Totally worth watching!!!! I have read the books and enjoyed the show very much. Bridget Henley as Kaelin,was a perfect choice. Can't imagine anyone else in the role. Craig Horner was great as the Seeker. If you have read the books then you have to have the dvd of the series.
B005C9YZKU|5.0|My entire family - husband, seven-year-old daughter, and I love BBC's Planet Earth series. It captures the wonders and mysteries of our great, wonderful planet in a production that is spectacular for its beauty and insights. What better way to introduce the younger generation (and reacquaint the older) with the natural wonders of planet Earth? This Blu-Ray set is not only beautiful in its presentation, it is also one of the best in terms of clarity of images and audio quality.<br /><br />Much has been said about this show in previous reviews, so I will just recap the essentials. The production is narrated by Sir David Attenborough (I could just listen to this man all day with his evocative voice and unique narrative style). There are eleven episodes altogether running approximately 50 mins in length. The eleven episodes are found on four of the Blu-Ray discs, and the other two DVDs contain extras. All the DVDs are encased in paper jackets which can then be inserted into the spaces for each within the globe. For convenience sake, the globe sits flat.<br /><br />It appears that this limited edition set numbers 50,000 sets. In addition, as if these features were not enough, there are four art cards that come with the set. I liked the cards since they are beautiful but it's not something I would have missed having in this set. Nevertheless, it is certainly a nice touch.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, the picture quality is amazing, with clear, crisp images in 1080i. The audio quality is also excellent in DTS-HD 5.1. Customers might also be interested to know that in addition to the English track, there are subtitle options in English, Spanish, and French.<br /><br />As for the extras contained on two of the DVDs, there are over seven hours of special features, including:<br />Producer commentary on select episodes<br />Four additional episodes, i.e. Great Planet Earth Moments, Snow Leopard: Beyond the Myth; Elephant Nomads of the Namib Desert, and Secrets of the Maya Underworld.<br />A thirteen minute sneak preview for a new BBC production, Frozen Planet<br />Music only viewing option<br />Diaries<br /><br />In case anyone was wondering, the eleven episode titles are:<br />From Pole to Pole<br />Mountains<br />Fresh Water<br />Caves<br />Deserts<br />Ice Worlds<br />Great Plains<br />Jungles<br />Shallow Seas<br />Seasonal Forests<br />Ocean Deep<br /><br />There's so much to appreciate and enjoy in this glorious Blu-Ray commemorative set of BBC's Planet Earth. Children and adults alike will be captivated by this engrossing production that informs, enlightens, and serves as a reminder of what is truly precious and deserves to be protected. Highly recommended!a Underworld.<br />A thirteen minute sneak preview for a new BBC production, Frozen Planet<br />Music only viewing option<br />Diaries<br /><br />In case anyone was wondering, the eleven episode titles are:<br />From Pole to Pole<br />Mountains<br />Fresh Water<br />Caves<br />Deserts<br />Ice Worlds<br />Great Plains<br />Jungles<br />Shallow Seas<br />Seasonal Forests<br />Ocean Deep<br /><br />There's so much to appreciate and enjoy in this glorious Blu-Ray commemorative set of BBC's Planet Earth.

B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Great movie, I was hesitant to watch this one. But I was nicely surprised, I have not read the books and can't wait for the next one to come out. Worth watching.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|Hello All,<br />In the past I saw this movie and really liked it! I recently decided to purchase the DVD of it. I am very pleased with my recent order through Amazon and the Seller. Everything went fine! I have watched it several times, since I received it. Brad Pitt did a wonderful job in this movie. It will always be on of my favorite movies, of his. All the actor`s were wonderful!<br />Best Regards,<br />Barb
B00005JPS8|2.0|Some the best and in-depth story-telling scenes are not in the main feature film. Even worse the opening scene is cut short as well. The thing about the film segment is the tail end of its is used in a separate scene later (i.e. even you went to the trouble of making your own cut you couldn't just slap it in). What is wrong with people today? You might as well record this from television on the next opportunity and edit out the commercials! The only saving grace is the second DVD with features on the making of the film.
B0062A5RUA|5.0|The talent level of these musicians is beyond impressive. Anyone familiar with Myles' and Slash's work (Alter Bridge, GnR, Velvet Revolver) will love this album. It has a ton of tracks of some familiar classics and newer originals. \\"Starlight\\" ended up being my favorite non-classic track, but this is definitely an album you can listen to start to finish over and over.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I've really enjoyed reading the story of how Jacob Portman searches for his roots, and finds something he didn't expect at all. The book is written with charm and humor. I love the cover, and it evokes the spirit of the book quite well. The photographs throughout the book are an interesting addition, and they look good even on a Kindle.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|When I started this book I thought it was going to be another one that a person could not stop reading but it failed to end that way-- it was to scattered -it went from the babies to the mother to people just killing people  not my favorite Kathy Reichs book
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|i love this game works great on kindle. i highly recommend getting it. its challenging but it isnt so hard that you get stuck.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like the format of this app. It is User friendly. I highly recommend it to others. Try it!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have a Cruz Velocity Tablet - I have had this app for over 3mos and never installed. Quite frankly, I didn't think it would be so easy or do what it claimed. This pass Sat. 9/15/12 I decided to set it up. It is awesome, I have wifi but, when I went online through this app, it was faster, no blinking when trying to play  an online game. I Love this app, If you are wondering (like I was) which one to get, out of the many I researched, this is the one! CNET had a great review on it.
B000W4E3OS|5.0|Although I love classical music and have listened to much of it for over 50 years, I'm just not expert enough to comment on the playing, unlike some rather pretentious reviewers on the Amazon site. One for example complained that Ashkenazy played the first prelude of Book 1 of the WTC too slowly. Actually the score notes say 'MODERATO' for the first prelude. Maybe some of these 'expert' reviewers might consider that there are things about the music they do not know and that their personal preferences may not be what the composer wished. This Scriabin recording is of high sound quality and quite engaging. Also excellent value.
B009329ZF2|1.0|This was so an awful movie! I was really hoping to like it seeing as it was filmed in Pearl Harbor where I'm stationed in US Navy but it was just too outlandish to go with. I can handle the fantasy part of it but they really didn't research the minute details of what goes on in the Navy. Hey at least my 8 year old liked it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the pivotal book of the three-book series.  Anyone who has an interest in \\"Hunger Games\\" needs to know what happens next.  This book is a surprisingly satisfying sequel and sets up the story for the last of the books.  A story told as well as the first book but with dizzying twists that spin the reader silly.  Great book!  Get it.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|I just finished reading No Easy Day, the story of the SEAL Team 6 raid that killed Osama bin Ladin.  It was written by Mark Owen with the help of Kevin Maurer.  Mark Owen is a pen name used to hide the identity of the real SEAL and team leader who participated in the raid and delivered the coup de grace that killed bin Laden.  Owen was a SEAL for more than ten years and participated in many missions, including another high profile rescue, that of Richard Phillips, the captain of the merchant ship Maersk Alabama, who was being held by Somali pirates.<br /><br />The book is no literary masterpiece.  But it does provide a straight-forward description of one SEAL's motivations and the kind of personality that is driven to this kind of work.  It opens with a brief synopsis of the raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad.  It then flashes back to the years of training and the experiences that led up to the author's participation in the raid.  This flash back represents about two-thirds of the book.  It provides an important glimpse into the life and mindset of a man who claims to be a typical Navy SEAL.<br /><br />The description of the raid on bin Laden's compound is riveting.  SEAL's like Owen train day after day, simulating all the different scenarios they might encounter, till the necessary survival behavior becomes second nature, like the muscle memory of elite athletes that requires little conscious thought to complete.  Raids become missions, men become targets, and killing becomes routine.<br /><br />The bin Laden raid was planned down to the smallest detail and many contingencies were planned for.  Learning from the disastrous attempt to free the Iranian hostages during the Carter Administration, they provided for multiple back-up helicopters in case one or more of the attack craft were damaged or destroyed.  Yet there were things they could not know.  For instance, they did not know what the interior layout of bin Laden's house was like.  Once inside, they would have to rely on their training to find their target.<br /><br />We all know that the mission was a success and that bin Laden was killed, so I won't go into any more detail about the raid.  As a society, we need these warriors, acting as our surrogates, to hunt down the bad guys.  We select them, train them and pay them to do this work.  But the whole issue of the existence of a highly trained killing force employed and trained by us to do our bidding is disturbing on several levels.<br /><br />For example, what kind of men devote their lives to becoming highly trained, disciplined killers?  They appear unmoved by the lives they take.  Summing up one raid as a, \\"Successful mission.  Seventeen killed\\".  The dead are the bad guys, the targets.  The SEAL's have noble motives, yet in the end they give their lives to the art of war and killing.  How do they do this?  What toll does it take on them?  Can they ever successfully leave this work and reenter the larger society?  And who are we that we require this kind of service from others?  The answers are not in this book.<br /><br />Yet there is nobility, even if the contrasts are jarring.  After bin Laden has been mortally wounded and dispatched with several shots to his chest, the SEAL's herd his traumatized children and one wife to a balcony removed from the scene, while another tends to the wound a second wife sustained during the action.  In another incident, a courier is killed in his house in an exchange of gunfire and then his wife and children are escorted to safety.<br /><br />The book is truly a riveting bit of history.  Osama bin Laden was a mass murderer who needed to be brought to justice.  This was done.  And while I do not rejoice in anyone's death, I am satisfied that in this case, his death was the correct and just thing.  I am thankful for the skilled men who delivered this justice and the courageous president who ordered the mission.  Still, in my heart I long for a world in which men like bin Laden cease to hate and where men like Mark Owen do not have to defend us from them.
B0087HT36U|5.0|totally addicting and challenging! love it!!! love the bombs. needs more levels tho im almost threw with the entire thing!!!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This is the game that you share with your children, because it's beautifully crafted and non-violent.  The underlying messages are there, about how we are destroying our planet.  It's packaged in a wonderful story with excellent visual and sound.  Remember \\"Myst\\"?  This is Myst in the 21st century.  My favorite game collection of the last five years.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book really kept me interested.  Read it in between meetings at a work conference, couldn't wait to get back to my room at night to snuggle up with my Kindle.  The characters were well developed, warts and all.  I'm not a huge mystery fan, but if the rest of Flynn's writing is like Gone Girl, count me in.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|EXCELLENT BOOK! DID NOT WANT IT TO END. THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BEST TRILOGY I HAVE EVER READ.I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!
B0084IG7KC|3.0|I read this book back in 2007, before it was released. I remember thinking \\"oh another young adult novel...yawn\\" BUT I was wrong. I was engrossed immediately, shut down all outside bothers and read it in a day. I found myself connecting the characters in deep ways, crying for them, rooting for them, hoping, terrified, loving them. When the movie came out I was so scared that they would take the book and seriously mess it up. So we didn't see it in the theaters.<br /><br />I waited, and waited and saw some good reviews and bad. Finally we just gave in and watched it and I was so ....disappointed. I watched it unfold and kept thinking \\"they are missing so much\\" and \\"I don't give a shizz about any of these people\\" and \\"this is some seriously bad special effects\\" and \\"WHY WHY WHY!!!!\\"<br /><br />Suzanne Collins wrote such a descriptive book, but her screenplay was tepid and clipped and pathetic. My husband had never read the books, and he couldn't get any character development, back story, or feeling for the \\"world\\" of Hunger Games at all.  I felt sorta perturbed that the movie had been such a let down, I wanted it to be so much more.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|My only complaint with this book is that I was getting tired of the constant training in the order house... but then the book picks up steam quickly introducing us to mysteries and action of the world.<br /><br />Can't wait for book two!
B0087X728K|5.0|i installed a zalman 9900max-b cpu cooler, and it came with its own thermal compound. but after looking at a small sample of each, i prefered the artic silver.I also looked at tests on the inter net. any way this is the best paste out there, i highly give it five stars......  jesse
B0087HT36U|4.0|I like it. passes the time and just hard enough to be fun but not impossible. give it a shot
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I rented Season 1 from Redbox.  Was hooked on the series immediately.  Ordered Season 2 to catch up before Season 3 starts.  This is a great series with talented actors & original material.  Maggie Smith is superb, as one would expect, another gem from Masterpiece Theatre.  Good selection for anyone who loves period fiction.
0307474259|1.0|Aside from being redundant, citing conflicting research, and authored by a writer without a medical degree or any nutritional education (per his bio), this book gives dangerous advice. Anyone with any interest in nutrition science will be highly alarmed at his recommendation to use fake sweeteners. As a seemly acclaimed researcher Gary Taubes somehow failed to discover (or conveniently omitted) their dangers. Most recently, Aspartame has been found to be (along with MSG) a neurotoxin, which literally stimulates nerve cells within the brain itself into cell-death; it's also been banned in many countries throughout the world. With the exception of Stevia (which is a fructo-oligosaccahride and has interesting research to back its health supporting properties), he suggests the full spectrum of sugar substitutes but warns against sugar alcohols which he says causes 'abdominal discomfort'. Apparently, the carcinogenic properties of saccharine are not worthy of a warning. Furthermore, he suggests eating processed food (pepperoni?) as part of his menu. I would just love to pick apart his book page by page, opening for discussion his use of anecdotal evidence to legitimize his flawed point of view.<br /><br />This book makes me very angry because people who are looking to gain understanding of obesity and how to improve their own health are getting a partial and inaccurate picture and ultimately harmful advice. I suggest everyone question the research in this book and then go out and continue to educate themselves on how to support their own health and not to be subject to poor and possibly harmful advice. Off hand, a few books I recommend are Scott Ohlgren's 'The 28 Day Cleanse' and Diane San Filippo's 'Practical Paleo.' Both books are on the opposite side of the pro-protein spectrum and both give a wonderful, clear picture of how health works.
0141197714|5.0|This was exactly as described. I was not disappointed with it. Bought as a gift and they loved it very much. Would recommend.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|If you are old enough to remember Star Blazers from the late Seventies then this movie will bring back memories. This is a live action version of that Japanese Anime. Only draw back is this film is in Japanese so you will have to turn on captions. Very good CGI.
0451169514|3.0|When I began reading this book, I had very high expectations for it. This was because of a numerous amount of sources. My friends, who had all told me that It scared the bejesus out of them (pun intended). My past reads by him, such as Misery and 11/22/63. However, when I actually got around to reading this monster of a volume, I was sorely disappointed. First off, the book jumps around in time too many times. King writes the book as if you've already read it - meaning there are many scenes where you have no clue what's going on unto live finished the entire boom- and by the time you know the backstory, you've forgotten what the scene was even about. But it is also because of this that this book would be marginally more understandable if read through a second time. There is not a very adequate book summary about it on the inside cover, either. It leaves you completely in the dark. Normally, they give the reader just a taste of the actual book. But no, this one is 4 sentences about utter nonsense. Therefore, when I read it, I had next to no idea what was going on.<br />Now down to the actual plot. The plot is simple enough (that is, if you've ever gotten around to understanding it) - its about a clown that eats kids and changes shape. Now, you may be thinking, how did Stephen King manage to write over a thousand pages about that? Well, if you babbled every 5 seconds, you would. Many times, I had to jump back several hundred pages and reread scenes that had happened before. One of the few things that I actually enjoyed about this book was it's (somewhat) realness. It is clear that this book consisted of much filler - for after reading a thousand page book, shouldn't I have something more to summarize about it than one sentence? My advice to YOU, Constant Reader, is to stay far away from this book, unless you have plenty of time on your hands to reread it several times and get the gist of it. All in all, this book could be improved a lot. And shave several hundred pages off of it. The way that the kids and adults fight It is a little far-fetched, and the final form of It could have been different. I was interested in what it's true form might be (deadlights), but sadly, I never got to know what they were like. BUY IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
B004VDL826|5.0|This 3rd film manages to embody what made the original and its sequel resonate so well, even after all these years. \\"Solid State Society\\" still pulls at the questions involving humanities battle for its identity and what our technological innovations mean for our potential future. This film still embodies it's techno-thriller roots and succeeds in it broad foreboding message just a successfully as the first 2 films.

B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|Well, I bought this because I loved Legos as a kid & have been sick and grumpy all week.  I was<br />as excited as Christmas morning when I opened it up on Saturday morning; the box was huge,<br />bigger than it looked in the Lego store at the mall.  Inside the pieces were distributed between<br />a large number of stiff, crinkly clear plastic bags.  I dumped a few of the smaller bags into some<br />bins (I'm way more organized than when I was little), left the larger bags closed until I needed<br />something out of them, and started building.<br /><br />Hours passed.  This set has probably three times the pieces of the most complex set I'd built before,<br />something like the Blacktron Alpha Centauri Outpost, and nearly five times the pieces of my favorite<br />set of all time, the amazing Blacktron Aerial Intruder.  Saturday ended and I was halfway done!<br /><br />The next morning I finished the orbiter, external tank, and baseplate/stand.  My older sister built the<br />Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters, and then we assembled the components into the launch stack.<br />It was a lot more work than I expected, several evenings' worth for a patient teenager who also<br />has homework and such.  The finished product is beautiful and, well, accurate enough to the real<br />shuttle.  It's a satisfying build, and though I expect a few bits and pieces will break off if I ever try<br />to play with it (particularly the somewhat flimsy vertical tail), hunting down scattered pieces and<br />reattaching them is part of the fun.<br /><br />Just like the real space shuttles, this model isn't headed into orbit.  I work in a physics department,<br />and I intend to display it in my office to show my love of space travel, space technology, and the<br />complex and ambitous story of human attempts to engineer reusable things.

1439102430|2.0|I have to echo the readers who gave this book 3 stars or less.  It was, overall, boring.  I think it's also a bit implausible to imagine that a forensic anthropolgist should be traveling all over western Canada to track down a missing person.  That just seems silly to me.  I thought it started out interesting with the corpses of the babies, but just deteriorated after that and once again, the heroine finds herself in peril after making too many dumb moves.  I think the most interesting part of this series is the anthropolgical stuff,  and that seemed to end after the first few chapters.  I agree with the review that mentioned by the time we found out about the \\"bad guy\\" I couldn't even remember who it was!  Not one of her most interesting reads for sure!

0385344333|4.0|I see a lot of reviewers complaining that A Wanted Man is slow, boring, and every other adjective possible that would fit under those headings.  This is fiction, and any true Reacher fan will be able to appreciate most of this book for the great piece of fiction that it is.  The truth is that the latest Reacher book is actually just a continuation of previous ones.  Both in terms of plot and writing style.<br /><br />Lee Child has realized that Reacher is aging, and it just isn't realistic for him to be engaged in constant slug fests with the enemies.  Even though he may be a physical freak, aging takes its toll on everyone.  The bigger they are the harder they'll fall, etc.  Instead we get to see a side of Reacher explored that has always been overshadowed by his incredible fighting skills; his intelligence.  Reacher has always been described as extremely street smart if nothing else, but in A Wanted Man we see it goes beyond that and we get an insight into the way his mind works.  More so then in any of the previous books.<br /><br />Look, I understand that some people read these books for the machismo that they inspire and the fact that Reacher is plain and simple a bad ass.  But, Child has shown before that he likes to at least acknowledge that life realisms such as aging exists and to expect him to continue on as if Reacher was 29 30 is unrealistic.  The fact that it has taken this long for the process to become noticeable is stretching it as is.  If you want some pure action, no thinking required book then go pick up any other book that vaguely resembles the Reacher series.  Odds are that all realism will be thrown out the door and you can have your non-aging hero and we'll all be happy.<br /><br />Now, this is not to say that the book is perfect.  It isn't by a long shot, but for a transition book it was pretty well done.  Lee Child took a shot in the dark by drastically altering the style of his books, and one should give him credit where credit is due for pulling it off as well as he did.<br /><br />: Warning, Spoilers Ahead:<br /><br />The start of the book is one of the strongest points I think.  It does a nice job of giving the reader enough information to allow them to start speculating and creating their own theories while not giving everything away from the get-go.  We know that someone important has been killed but we're unsure as to why they're important and why they ended up in the middle of nowhere.  We know that the people picking up Reacher are almost certainly going to be the ones that did the killing.<br /><br />We do not know why they would pick someone up like Reacher though since most fleeing criminals don't really want to take hitchhikers with them.  From there it becomes a game of trying to catch the murderers and we begin to learn more about all the players involved.  We see the gears in Reacher's head working as we have seen to one level or another before, but more so now.  The reader has always been given the sense of his intelligence but this time it is really spelled out by all the small things that he takes into account and calculates in the small spans of time he is given.<br /><br />Nothing of particular note happens until Reacher is almost shot in the motel room.  This is the first bit of foreshadowing that indicates not all is as it seems.  From there the reader should begin to suspect that this is deeper than it would first appear, though with all Reacher books this should be a given.  Time passes, and the kidnapping of Delfuenso's child gets the wheels turning for the meat of the plot to begin.<br /><br />Why would the child of a dead woman be kidnapped?  It seems painfully obvious that Delfuenso is still alive, and I was honestly rather disappointed by this because it was such an obvious plot turn that I thought maybe Child was beginning to go easy on his readers and cater to those action obsessed fans.  Fortunately I was proved very wrong.<br /><br />Finding out that Mcqueen was a double agent wasn't a big surprise but did explain a lot.  Finding out that Delfuenso was a sleeper agent though was very surprising and really made me appreciate how unexpected and well-designed Child's good plot turns can be.  From this part out it was a typical Reacher book.  Reacher finds out who-dun-it, goes and kills them, gets lost quickly...<br /><br />Except it wasn't.  The end of this book was actually the weakest part in my opinion, and was vaguely disappointing.  The plot itself wasn't bad, in fact it was kind of novel.  You don't hear of terrorist banker bad guys all that often.  And, while it sounds implausible at first guess, it worked all right with this book.  If that had been the weakest part then I would probably be giving this book 5/5.<br /><br />Tragically though, that was not the weak part of this book.  Instead, the weakest part of this book was the action itself.  It honestly seemed like something any generic action writer could write.  It wasn't horrible, but Reacher has long been known for suspense that leaves you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next move.  There are countless times that I can remember unconsciously holding my breath while reading.  Just imagining myself in Reacher's shoes because of the vivid imagery and waiting for the other shoe to drop.<br /><br />Nothing could have been further from the truth this time around.  The death of Sorenson was abrupt and should have created a lot of empathy in the reader.  The truth though was that it was rather easy to shrug off because there was not much attachment to her.  Then Reacher just marched in and killed them easy as 1-2-3.  It never really felt like he didn't have a chance, even when his thoughts were indicating he didn't think he had one.  Then the end was just completely abrupt.  It felt like Child didn't know how to end this one, and it's really too bad because he had been on fire up until the last 60 pages of it.<br /><br />Still, it was a solid book overall and a transition that I think was needed.  My biggest problem though is that I'm still not sure how long Child can keep older Reacher going in a fun manner.  I hope he will start writing more about his army days.  This will allow him to put more action in it, though I certainly hope he will keep showing some insights like he does in this book.  Overall I would say A Wanted Man is a solid 4/5.le agent wasn't a big surprise but did explain a lot.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|The first slow scene is when the father talks to his daughter...dads all wrapped up in shiny armor, which just like in opera, makes a performance seem like a tree standing. They simply didn't have a clue as to how the scene should be in terms of creating an entertaining moment. The daughter needed to have tons of attitude, and dad needed to be banging his head against the wall....instead it really slows up the film. I imagine once special effects added the proper visual layering to the scene, it was going to be too expensive to reshoot when they saw what they had. The rest of the film is a gorgeous blast. Incredible detail in the effects take it to another level, and you won't see this level  again unless you're watching something like Marvel's The Avengers, which also had absolutely top quality effects and design work. So make sure you see this film in Blu-Ray, as it's visual details are fabulous. At the moment, I can't remember the other slow scene. THe 3-D was excellent too.
B004K4IZ54|4.0|A lot of people hate this movie. I am not one of those people. I actually enjoyed this movie. I thought it was a faithful extension of the original and the special effects were great.<br /><br />The 3D is very tasteful. I.e. no obvious gimmicks with characters through things towards the camera to get a reaction from the audience.<br /><br />If you like the original movie or are simply a fan if Sci-Fi you should enjoy this movie.
B0089BSM70|5.0|I noticed all the 1 star reviews on this site and references to Rob Zombie's Halloween 2...If you look at the box or read the details, you will see this is John Carpenter's Halloween 2...Not that trash Zombie movie.<br /><br />This movie felt like a continuation of the original and 'to me' was a classic end to the Halloween Movies. I know of the countless sequels, but since JC wasn't involved, I consider them really low budget knock-offs that should never have been made.<br /><br />Again, to me, this is really were the Halloween movies ended. Anything else was made to cash in on the name without even attempting to come up with anything original in thought or style.
B005FISBTO|2.0|What is up with these big name shows ruining finales now a days.<br /><br />Season 5 of Dexter was great, but the final episode was lame.<br /><br />Season 6 picks up where season 5 left off, but I feel like the show in this season specifically is running on fumes. Most shows have lots of characters for the viewer to sustain interest, but the now, 6 seasons later, each episode, throughout the entire episode is Dexter, Dexter, Dexter. The other characters fall majorly behind in this season with the exception of his sister, but I was not a fan of the direction they decided to go with her. They turn this bad a$$ woman into a feeble little puppy dog who falls in love with....SAY WHAT!?!?!? It seemed very out of her character.<br /><br />All the other characters and their personal lives do not shine. Theres really nothing to know, show, or even care about them.<br /><br />Other than that, mostly all of the event of season 6 were very predictable. I easily guessed where they were going with this season by episode 2, but it took them 8 entire episodes to get to the point that I already knew by episode 2. I felt the whole season to be very dragged out, only to be ended with yet another major finale let down.<br /><br />The only event that made the entire season worth it was the very last 3 seconds of season 6, but at the same time....why was she even there? Maybe they will explain that in season 7, but I'm not anxiously waiting for the next season after watching this one.<br /><br />I'd recommend watching it for kicks, but it's definitely not on my lists of re-watches.<br /><br />Hope this helps! =)

B000002G8L|3.0|Eric Clapton's Just One Night is one of my favorite rock albums, so when I saw this remaster, I thought I'd give it a try.<br />Reasonable decision, disappointing result.<br />Since my original disk is in fine condtion, I listened to tracks alternatively. The original definintely has richer, fuller sound. The original also opens with the audience reaction to Eric walking out on stage which sets the tone for this live album. The original just has more life and spunk.<br />I guess the remaster is better than nothing, but if you want the real McCoy, find an original.

1476712042|5.0|~Updated Review<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster by Jaime Mcguire<br />Genre: Contemporary Romance<br />Age Group: New Adult<br />Release Date: July 12, 2012<br />Print Length: 434<br />Format: Kindle<br />Review Date: April 9, 2013<br />Overall Rating: 5 stars<br />Steam Rating: 3.5 stars<br /><br />I have to be up front and I tell you that I am slightly biased when it comes to this book.  I first read Beautiful Disaster (BD) in September of last year and I fell in love with it.  So much so that I put it at #1 on my all-time favorite books list, and I have read a lot of books.  So I started the reread already in love with the characters.  I am readying myself to read Walking Disaster the follow up book in Travis's POV.<br /><br />Did I love it just as much?  Absolutely!  I loved reliving the extremely passionate but volatile romance between Abby and Travis.  BD is a very intense book that brings out powerful emotions.  One minute I'm giddy, the next I'm frustrated and full of anguish.  Do not think BD is a fairy tale romance.  It is real, visceral, and chaotic.  It's full of sex, violence, gambling, and underage drinking; with a very toxic relationship at its core.  If this offends you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.  Its name is Beautiful Disaster for a reason. I say this because I have seen many negative reviews based on being offended by the content in some way, the book is not trying to send a message, it's for entertainment purposes--and for adults only--so you have been warned.<br /><br />Abby \\"Pidge\\" Abernathy is an 18 year old college freshmen running from her seedy past.  Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox (HOT, HOT, HOT) is the college bad boy, complete with tattoos and a Harley.  He also is an extremely good, undefeated fighter in an illegal fighting ring.  They meet and fall for each other, hard.  Because their feelings are so strong, and they are both insecure and damaged, they are constantly exploding on each other and those around them.  It's ugly when they are fighting, but amazingly beautiful when they are not.  It is definitely a wild ride, and that is why I LOVE this book so much.<br /><br />Quote from Abby:<br />\\"...each time I did something to push him away, I was terrified it would work.\\"<br /><br />Quote from Travis:<br />\\"I didn't know I was lost until you found me.  I didn't know what alone was until the first night I spent without you in my bed.  You're the one thing I've got right.  You're what I've been waiting for, Pigeon.<br /><br />~StacyHgg<br />Books Unhingedut amazingly beautiful when they are not.

1451627289|3.0|With such high reviews, it was surprising to me that I thought this book was just \\"ok\\"... I think it had the potential to be a great book if it focused less on JFK and more on the other \\"life changing\\" incidents in the book.  Without getting specific, I think blowing up the janitors storyline a little bit more or the life of Deke/Ellie/Sadie and and realizing that changing the past has ramifications would have been an excellent book by itself.  Bringing in the assasination of JFK made it too outrageous to go along with. Then, there's the issue of Lee Oswald as the lone gunman. I found myself getting increasingly annoyed at the naivity of the writing to believe that 24 yr old uneducated untrained LHO did everything himself...<br /><br />That said, It kept me reading and I finished all 850 pgs (probably could have cut out a lot of the details in the book)in a week.  It's a quick read.... just might find yourself annoyed with details and lack of JFK conspiracy theories.
B009329Y30|3.0|Slow, not great acting on the part of Zac Efron, highly predictable. Something in the editing, flow of scenes just not right.  I would give it a 2.5 if I could instead of 3.  Wait until it's free on TV.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game.  I wish the tutorial had explained energy better so I did not waste all my diamonds.  Looking toward to updates!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is the first book I read by Lee Child. I loved this book so much I read it twice. It had just the right amount of action & some of killings were gruesome. I love everything about the Jack Reacher character, he's smart & he can fight. This is a great book to start a series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read all 3 books in the trilogy.  50 Shades Darker is by far the best of the 3.  I have re-read it 3 times since August 27.  Each time I fall more in love with Christian's and Ana's characters.  This is NOT a book of S&M.  This is a true love story.  I know mostly women are readying this book but men would find this book so interesting and erotic on so many levels also.  I recommend you read these books with someone you love.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I don't use this one much but for being free, I can't complain. It can be a little sluggish but it depends how strong your wifi connection is.
B0087HT36U|4.0|enjoyable and challenging enjoyed playing it. found it rather addictive. would recomend. it to others. fun way to spend a day.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who likes fast paced fighting action games. I like the new treausure chest feauture
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Their love is very touching. I love the chapters after Ana's leaving and their fighting. Finally they could express their true feelings in the end of book two. I feel glad about that.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love being able to use this on my Kindle Fire while cooking in the kitchen.  So much more convenient than running back and forth to the computer.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works great on my Nexus 7 tablet. It is very easy to customize. Widgets are nice also. Keep up the good work. Thanks.
B008XG1X18|3.0|great app with wonderful ideas for parties and decorating the home. but the app on the kindle has a few kinks that need to be worked out. it freezes at timer then it just goes completely white. you then have to force close. if they fix that I would give it five stars!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Very handy and good to have on my Fire. Have had no problems with it ... and you can't beat the price! (grin)
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book was great, his other book Run is even better! I couldn't put them down :) Hoping to find more books as suspenseful as his!
B00881VLCE|1.0|I HAVE JUST DOWNLOADED THIS AND AFTER ONLY ONE PUZZLE I GIVE THIS THE TOP RATING.  I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED DOING ALL JIGSAW PUZZLES.  Now it is a few years later and my antivirus app wouldn't let me play anymore.  I changed antivirus app and had to reinstall the puzzle app.  Now I get lots of ads when I play and would like to know if there is an app to avoid them.  I still love doing the daily puzzles.<br /><br />I love jigsaws, but now I keep losing my progress each time I leave it.  When I touch certain areas of the puzzle area, it closes and then I have to start over again and again no matter what I try.  My husband has already given up on this app.  How can this be corrected?  I have changed from 5 to 1 star.<br /><br />Just a few days later.  Another puzzle almost complete today and progress disappeared so this is it.  How many times can a person put up with this?  If you cannot fix this big problem, this is goodbye.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The casting was perfect and I can't wait for the next movie to come out.  The special effects were great as well.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Not much to say other than this mic makes the audio of an interview a lot better than that of a built in mic of any camera. Id say it was a great buy cuz the price was unbeatable and the product is actually impressively decent. If you need this quick fix then 20 bucks shouldnt be a problem
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Dylan hears again during these times and they are a Changin inviting one on a trip upon a magic swirlin ship as your senses get stripped prompting one perhaps to wake up to strengthen the things that remain. Many roads walked down & seas sailed on the friendship before one is called a man. For an example, almost, the trip along the song 'Tempest' is supposedly a tale wind about the sinking of the well known unsinkable 'Titanic' ocean liner, they say, but do you recall a tempest/hurricane being involved with that gig? It is, was and shall be Dylan and deja vu all over again back from the future.  Dylan's Not There and that's OK. It's not about Dylan. He never said it was. It's about the songs and you. God is A Spirit. God is Love. Have a Good Time.
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|Such a beautiful & inspiring movie.  I recommend it to all that go thru life by a beat of a different drummer. Enjoy!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The 'Jaws' Blu-ray is a brilliant transfer of a 70's movie and the James Bond frame-by-frame transfers are outstanding examples of remastering older films, that's why it's a little mystifying why the 'Raiders' color balance looks a tiny bit off, too much brown/orange. But the transfers are generally fantastic. The classic original along with 'Temple of Doom' and 'Last Crusade' have never looked better, highlighting great British DOP Douglas Slocombe's brilliant deep focus cinematography.<br /><br />Spielberg's regular DOP, Janusz Kaminiski doesn't really (and probably didn't want to) replicate Slocombe's classic look, but he does subdue his usual milky, soft lit, muted style and gives 'Crystal Skull' a pleasing nostalgic tone.<br /><br />'Raiders' was the kind of cultural movie phenomenon back in the day that probably only 'The Avengers' matches today, but 'Raiders' even more so as it was such a trendsetting, genre defining movie. There had simply never been anything like it as a big studio, summer event movie.<br /><br />Roller coaster thrills, perils too numerous to count and great humour powered `Raiders' to instant classic status. It is still a massive influence on pop culture, films and filmmakers.<br /><br />It's a measure of how successful `Raiders' was is that Harrison Ford was an established star in the mega blockbuster Star Wars series,  but it was Indiana Jones launched him as global the superstar he is 30+ years later. Not bad for a 2nd choice for the lead. The rest of the cast is very special, Karen Allen is a fantastic, feisty love interest and the suave Paul Freeman and reptilian Ronald Lacey are classic villains. Then there's brilliant Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies as Indy's memorable comrades.<br /><br />It's all driven by Lawrence Kadan's great script that fills out Spielberg's brilliant set pieces with plenty of humour and gravitas. And of course there's the classic John Williams music that lifts all this genius to even greater heights.<br /><br />`Temple of Doom' is arguably the most viscerally exciting of the first three, but it's also the most controversial. An adventure movie that borders on horror and at times is downright sadism. Plus it's got the one of most annoying heroines in movies, Kate Capshaw has great appeal, but is done no favors with the way her whiny character is written. She's unfortunately matched in the pain-in-the-behind stakes by Indy's sidekick Short Round.<br /><br />Mola Ram is a heinous bad guy, played with demonic zeal by Indian star Amrish Puri.<br /><br />The set pieces are absolutely brilliant throughout, but the overall nasty dark tone detract from what is a great adventure film.<br /><br />`Last Crusade' was a welcome return to the tone of `Raiders' and whilst it lacked the freshness of the original or the sheer thrills of `Temple', it is easily the most emotionally  resonant and dramatically satisfying of the series.  Spielberg's brilliant casting of Sean Connery as Indy's father makes for real movie magic as two of the biggest movie starts of all time make a wonderful double act that powers the heart and soul of this movie.<br /><br />In terms of special features, this box sets isn't quite up there with Star Wars or even the original Star Trek films set, but it's still an absolute must have, sure to please fans.
B0091P6590|5.0|...and an answer to viewers hungry for a Mad Men type show, as well.<br /><br />I was surprised at how much I've enjoyed this show - discovered it here and devoured both seasons in a ridiculously small amount of time (I've been sick, but still...).  It's very addicting. The initial premise leaves room for lots of drama & interest.<br /><br />For several episodes of the 2nd season I felt the plots were getting over-complicated (how many conflicts can you stuff into one episode?). And there are moments, especially re: the romantic subplots, that are so predictable (I hate spoilers, so won't go into specifics), it kind of ruins it for me. But I was glad to see the writers pull the show back into better focus by the end of the season.<br /><br />I'm also posting this to, hopefully, create a boundary  before the review that is, I think, titled \\"Awesome,\\" which contains quite a few spoilers.  A pet peeve of mine.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0316023744|3.0|This book is well written, as is no real surprise, and if you knew nothing about World War II, this would be a fairly good introduction. On the other hand, I have considerable knowledge of the war, and this book lacked any great interest. There simply wasn't anything in there I hadn't seen before many, many times. There is no trace of \\"revisionism\\" here - every interpretation reflects the standard consensus, so far as I can tell.<br /><br />This is one of those books that is hard to review because I can't really think of anything very positive to say about it, yet I didn't hate it, either. Writing 800 pages without being interesting or original is an achievement of some sort, I guess.<br /><br />I didn't think Max Hastings' recent history of WW2 was very interesting, either. In my view, the single best one-volume history of WW2 remains Gerhard Weinberg's A World At Arms, even though it was written nearly 20 years ago.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am so excited it finally came out! download it now and expirience just why minecraft is just awesome. blab.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the bomb! I like the evil demon monkeys.<br />agian this game is number one wow. temple run is great.
0140143505|4.0|This easy....very quick read is lovely.  It records 20 years of letters written between a London bookseller and a NYC writer.  I read it as it was paired with one of my all time favorite books: The Guernsey<br />Literary Potato Peel Pie Society....which is a the same concept but more animated.  You will be inspired to use the written word more in communicating with those you love!
B008BDZOZY|5.0|Absolutely beautiful, quirky, inventive and dominating horn arrangements. I love this album more with each listening. Vocally and Lyrically, David Byrne is the same master he has always been.  I had not listen to very much of St Vincent before, but this is a perfect pairing.  Optimist is quickly becoming an absolute favorite of mine.  The Forest awakes and Dinner for Two are also standouts. I could see myself coming away with a different favorite each time I listen to it.  Highly recommended for the adventurous music fan.  It may not be for everybody, but it is definitely for me.
1612183956|4.0|\\"Pines\\" gives us the story of Ethan Burke, a Secret Service agent that awakens on the side of river on the outskirts of the small town of Wayward Pines, Idaho. Burke's memory of why he is in Wayward Pines, and what has happened to him is gone. As he begins to investigate what has happened, and why he is in town to begin with, he begins to uncover some startling and sinister clues that this sleepy little mountain town may be hiding some dark secrets.The deeper Burke digs into Wayward Pines, the creepier the story becomes, and appears as if Burke may not be able to leave the \\"Pines.<br /><br />I highly recommend you don't read too many reviews for \\"Pines\\" lest you run across any spoilers. \\"Pines\\" is a novel of building suspense....until it breaks out into full blown horror. This is the type of novel that will keep you up turning pages late into the night. Blake Crouch builds a genuine nightmare that unfolds at a perfect pace, drawing the reader in, and then picking up the pace so that you will finish the novel in one or two sittings...simply because you can't put it down.If you want a horror novel soaked in atmosphere, that ramps up to a break neck pace, then pick up \\"Pines\\".
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is a awesome game its so addictingg! I love it you earn tons of cool stuff I cant wait till I earn the assassin. I love bow and arrows I have three bows this game is awesome.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I'm thoroughly impressed with this backpack.  I only received it this weekend, but when I brought it in to work this morning, I noticed a co-worker who had this same model for two years.  We talked about it and he loves it too.
031620157X|5.0|This book took me out of my life and into the lives of Alex and Connor. I, like Alex, feel that fairy tale creatures are my oldest and dearest friends. I could not put this book down, and I finished it in a week, sadly, because I wanted it to go on forever. I was reminded of tales i had forgotten, and details that were kept out of the stories i read as a child. The tale of the Queen is the most beautiful and sad version I've heard in my life,and I want to thank chris colfer for writing this book. Without him, I wouldn't have remembered who I truly am inside. Thank you, Chris, you reminded me that i do love to read books beside harry potter, and that there is always the possibility of magic, especially when you need it the most. <3 10 stars out of 5!!!
B0012PDVQ2|4.0|suspensful, thought provoking, funny Harrison Ford blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book is hard to put down as it was hard to pick up the first one of the series. There is an interesting twist to the love story. Looking forward to find out what happens in book 3.
B0000042H4|5.0|To hear this work of art is a complete learning experience. There's no doubt that the Ring is not only a musical but a philosophical experience, after all we need to remember the long standing friendship between Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche which clearly nurtured each other works.The demise of the gods and the rise of the human being is all there, Wotan himself recognizes in Die Walk&uuml;re that he needs a human to complete his work, being that he is fatally tied by his own contracts and conventions.<br /><br />The more we advance into this music, the more interesting questions are posed to us, for instance, what is the meaning Nothung the sword and Fafner the dragon could  have in our our contemporary world? Also lets not forget the fascinating Tarnhelm, that allows its owner to become in anything he wishes.<br /><br />So basically this Ring is not an end, but a beginning, a great purifying experience that is going to change your outlook and attitude towards life.<br /><br />For the soloists i would like to concentrate first on Hans Hotter, whom uses his musical qualities as a means to accomplish his interpretation of the character. In this case those who are expecting an imposing, powerful Wotan, are just not paying attention to the meaning of the work, since in Die Walk&uuml;re  Wagner intended to portrait a god in his darkest hours, a god in decline, a figure that haunted and tired by his failures and challenges asks literally for the end. But even though he's a god in decay he's not a silly god, retaining all of his knowledge intact, and Hotter is able to reflect just that.<br /><br />Then we have Wolfgang Windgassen's Siegfried, again is not a matter of musical capabilities but of interpretation, if we listen to the recording under Clemens Krauss we get a sense of how much Windgassen's lecture of Siegfried's role evolved throughout the years. He sounds like a force of nature, sometimes a naive character also conditioned by his own background (do youremember how when discovering Brunhilde he thought he had found his mother?) his situation during the end of the second act of Siegfried give us a very clear sight of why this man wanted so bad the alliance and approval of Gunther in G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung, simply this demi-god is alone and seeking for a sense of belonging. Also rhythmically speaking Gerhard Stolze and Windgassen clearly eclipse their counterparts of the Krauss version.<br /><br />Of all the operas on this cycle, you need to pay attention the most to G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung, the quintessential Ring drama, it has all the musical means the other dramas have plus the thing that they lack: Choruses, and boy Wagner knows how to use them to improve the drama! during the second act, you feel how Brunhilde's thirst for revenge increases to a cosmic level and how much the figure of Siegfried is endangered, the power of the music is such that you really feel swept away by the slow agony of the characters that leads to the chilling revenge trio.<br /><br />Finally we need to rescue the value of the Ring as an Utopia, as a work that is showing us the realization of a world without gods, where the human being understands that achieving the world he wishes is within his own grasp and not in a permanent paranoia of ghosts and ethereal but intangible figures and fights. Those who support this vision of the world would definitely appreciate all the knowledge they can get by reading and listening this magnum opus.
B00846REIS|4.0|It was a very fast read, a little more vanilla than 50 shades. I'm addicted to the characters and all the their bickering! Can't wait for next one in series!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Definitely well worth the price..<br /><br />I cant even say how much I enjoyed this book.from the minute I picked it up, I just could not put it down..
1586634070|5.0|My daughter used this to supplement her reading material for AP english.  She read the books for her test, which requires 5 books to be read over the summer.  We decided to get her the spark notes to help cement nuances about the material.  She did very well on the test, which possibly had more to do with the amount that she studied, but the spark notes certainly didn't hurt either.
B003QSMC18|5.0|My four year old loved this movie. She has been doing make believe about the movie with her baby dolls ever since she saw it last week. :)
B003AYPMBU|5.0|This edition of BRITISH STEEL is very good. The disc's look like they were made here, but  it's not clear if that<br />is the case. All I know is that the concert that is included as the bonus concert was recorded in Florida, down<br />south from where I am in the State. I have seen different versions of the packaging for BRITISH STEEL 30th<br />ANNIVERSARY, so I suspect it is a US edition, and the FBI logo is usually a give-away.The sound is awesome on the<br />remaster for each track. Like the Album HELLBENT FOR LEATHER 2 years before, the sounds quality is awesome.<br />  The concert is an amazing video experience. From what the band has said about the event, when they first<br />started to try and go, the power drain was so high the whole rig blew, at least until they could reset and then<br />restart. The extra tracks are total gems, so  with the HD channels \\"Mobile\\" rig recording the concert in full (<br />unedited thank the gods), the sound is more than Awesome. With 5.1 sound, this DVD version of the album is just a<br />gem, whether you have a standard ear-bud, Headphone, or something like a Monster Diamond Tear Head Set, the DVD<br />gives you a more than good sound. About the only other Live DVD by priest you need is the Double DVD that includes<br />PRIEST LIVE ( 1986) in Texas, which also has another concert thrown in. But, in the last ten years Priest has put<br />out some great material, and the British Steel Anniversary Album is an excellent concept. If you can still get the<br />Special edition with the DVD, its worth every penny. ( My Surprise, I should try and get the import and see if there is any difference; Lately I have been finding significant differences in packaging or content; Either way I do not regret buying this gem !! ). And the other thing of note is that the Booklet is pretty good !! Too often the British Versions of Many bands albums have great Booklets, and CDs of superior quality , except with special editions by Rhino... which isodd, since regular Rhino versions are kind of below average, but Rhino Special Editions are beyond good, since they are US only [ I presume ] ).
B005IQZB14|5.0|I finished this a couple days ago but haven't had the time to write the review. Even though I have finished reading two books and a short story since then I still feel five stars is appropriate. This flawed depressed person finally decides to go on her sacred walk, a hermitage, or just plain run away to the PCT. There are worse ways to deal with angst, but none seem as healthy as this one. Sure there were dangers, but as she says, most of what we are afraid of are images in our heads. I loved her powerful Amazonian woman mantras.<br /><br />I loved being with Cheryl on her journey, both the internal and external. The author made it an easy flow between, like most of our minds work during long periods of boredom or as we move through pain.<br /><br />Though this was a library book I think I may someday buy the paperback. Who knows, it could be the very novel I burn ten or fifteen pages a day! Then again, maybe not. I don't know if I could burn a book. Especially if by re-reading the pages would get me to actually go for this hike!<br /><br />I do like the author's writing style and think I will look up her other books.
0525953728|5.0|Emily, Not everyone likes your Muslim president. Its a sad day when two soldiers were arrested recently for plotting to murder Obama (sad that it should come to that level of hate). The same thing happened to Hitler. Remember there is freedom of speech in this country - at least for now, until Obama changes that too.
B000FBJF6Y|3.0|No text-to-speech. Luckily the library had the CD set. So I bought the Kindle version to read while the lovely voice of Lisette Lecat narrated the story to me. I think her voice added a taste of the culture to the reading of the story. Even still, I think I might have been just as happy with the robot voice on my Kindle. This is an expensive read for me. It is hard to try and get the whole package from the library on anything. When a part comes in that's what you have to drop other reads so as to get it done on time. I don't do well with just the audio version, I have to immerse myself in a book to finish. And because of all that I just said, this story leaves me not caring if I read any more of these books.<br /><br />The story was of a sing-song feel and I often found myself drifting to sleep or off to other thoughts. The author did capture the love of country and the evils that still exist. It reminded me of reading missionary books at my grandmother's house. I loved seeing a different world than the one I live in. But sad to say the attitudes of men seem universal. I was so disappointed in the ending. I thought we had finally grew a strong self-sufficient woman. Meh!<br /><br />Unless the Kindle and Audible versions of the rest of the series fall into my lap, I will not seek out the rest of the series.<br /><br />Since Amazon won't let me review these books separately, the above was about the first book. The following is the second book, Tears of a Giraffe.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I didn't think I would go on and read the next book. But I saw that my library had the Kindle version AND the audio CDs to go along with it. And as luck would have it I was able to check them out at the same time!<br /><br />I can't tell you how marvelous it is to listen to the narration of  Lisette Lecat and her accent. Yes, I could have read the Kindle version without the text-to-speech and no audio version to help me. After all, I did read three chapters before the CDs showed up for me to check out. But that voice brought a reality to the characters of Botswana's No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency.<br /><br />What a beautifully told story! It does stray from my goal of reading books written by females with strong female characters. By the way, that goal is swiftly narrowing down to wanting to read mostly OLDER females. I'm tired of Young Adult books. But, though this is written by a male, I find the older female and her co-characters written so well that I dearly love this series.<br /><br />I hear that it has been made into HBO series. I can understand why. Yet I can't imagine it is as wonderful as these books. How can visual arts capture inner thoughts? But I will watch them and give them a chance.<br /><br />Since I can't afford to buy this series I will have to take it slowly as the library has the copies of Kindle and audio available.or me to check out.

Kudrow and Sorvino are so great together! What a perfect comedy team match! They go so well together. It is so funny, because they are so stupid and ditzy. If your looking for lots of laughs, this is the movie to see and if you love chick flicks. Great 80's music, a great cast, and lots of laughs makes this a great movieh

B008QE9VJI|5.0|I saw this film for the first time last night. I couldn't wait to see what this movie was going to be like, because I wanted to see this movie for three months. I am a huge Tim Burton fan! His films are always amazing, and I wasn't expecting anything less with Dark Shadows. I found this movie to be very fun, campy and original. It had the darkness of a Tim Burton film, but plenty of witty humor to go along with it. Johnny Deep played a very convincing role along with his supporting cast that included Helen Bonham Carter who was also amazing as well. If you enjoy Tim Burton movies or are curious about this film, you will not be disappointed as this movie never missses the mark. I am definitely purchasing this movie the day it is released on dvd to add to my Tim Burton collection!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I've had this DVD for a few years now, and it's one of my regularly used workout DVDs. I work out at home 5/6 days a week, and I love the fact that on the days when I'm exhausted, I can stick with a lower level, and on the days when I want to tear it up, I can go with Level 3.<br /><br />For people who are new to this DVD, Jillian keeps you moving the whole time. It's relatively low impact (except for in Level 3 where there are considerably more jump moves) and it's surprising effective for a 20-minute workout. She always does a warm-up and cool-down, so you can expect the workout to take about 25-30 minutes total from the time you pop the DVD in to when you're wiping up the sweat afterward.<br /><br />For an at-home workout DVD, I applaud Jillian for giving good modifications and pointing out common form mistakes. As she says, she does \\"make big promises\\" with the DVD, but if you show up, do the work, eat right, and workout consistently, you will reap the benefits from Jillian shredding you into shape.

B008O69SZ0|5.0|For those who don't know, Ian Hunter was the lead singer/piano banger and later rhythm guitarist for one of the most important bands of the late 60's(until Led Zeppelin showed up)and Definitely The Most Important Band of the early 70's (even the mighty Zep were jealous of them, a drunken Bonzo and Pagey actually trying to steal their thunder during their Tremendous Uris Theatre gig on Broadway)and their legacy has lasted well beyond. The torch has been carried proudly since by their most talented member, Ian Hunter. And wow, what a career he has built for us die-hard fans who can't get enough! Mott the Hoople at the start were the creation of one of the most talented/demented producers of the crazy psychedelic period when rock and roll suddenly(because of nightmare events in the world) turned much darker, Guy Stevens. He loved \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" by Bob Dylan,as the rest of us all did, so much that he envisioned a band that could play that song over and over. And by god he succeeded- If you haven't already, you must listen to the first Mott The Hoople album. Then you will truly understand what Ian has achieved here. I think this new album is possibly his Best Ever. It even has a song that should be a big hit record- \\"When I'm President\\" has the potential to be a bigger hit than even his classic \\"Central Park and West\\". In fact it actually sounds alot like that song, but even catchier. A song that should be blasting out of every American's car radio. Definitely gonna be a Little Steven's Underground Garage \\"Coolest Song of the Week\\"-that's for sure. What I'm trying to get at is Ian seems to be looking back(I guess the live shows he did in England with MTH inspired this incredible record)and he's revisiting great little things that made his solo records and Mott The Hoople so great. This album is loaded with them. Check out \\"Fatally Flawed\\" with it's dynamics of quiet and loud. Reminds me of great songs like \\"The Journey\\" and the Live version of \\"Angel of Eighth Avenue\\" from MTH. I never could say it before, but his Rant Band have truly mastered that great MTH sound and have actually taken it into the 21st Century. I can't imagine how he will ever top this instant classic,but I hope he continues to try. A truly Amazing Artist at the Top of His Game. The Rock and Roll Circus is definitely back in town. Get This Now!enue\\" from MTH. I never could say it before, but his Rant Band have truly mastered that great MTH sound and have actually taken it into the 21st Century.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Grammy worthy material throughout this album.  Though I can imagine the Grammy Committee looking at the song lengths and rolling their eyes -- 7:30 --  that's like 2 or 3 songs to the committee.  ...And then Rush fans laugh at the Grammy Committee as usual.

B000NQRE1E|5.0|Titanic finally gets the DVD treatment its deserved after all this time.  This particular set is great as its got the BluRay discs as well as the DVD in case you have other players in the house that just have DVD players like I do.  There are so many extras and features on this set that you'll never get through it all in one sitting. There is one thing I noticed after watching the excellent four part feature set called &#34;Reflections on Titanic&#34; and that was where is Leonardo DiCaprio?  He is the only main player that is completely absent from speaking and contributing.  I thought that was odd.  Maybe he was asked and he said no or he was busy.  Other than that, this is still an incredible dvd set that delves into detail on the making of the movie and what they all went through.  There is also a nearly 2 hour documentary of an in depth look at the actual Titanic ship itself and how they attempted to solve the mystery of what really happened as if it were a crime scene.  This is hosted by the Director, James Cameron who you really appreciate his genius and intellect.  This documentary alone is already worth the price of this set.  The special features however can only be played on a BluRay player.  The DVD movie is just the movie.  There are also 60 other behind the scenes vignettes and 30 deleted scenes.  If you have a surround sound system then this is a movie you want to crank up.  It's as if you're on the ship with them.  This is definitely a keeper!  James Cameron did an exceptional job at including as much of the historical facts of what happened on that ship from when it left port to it's tragic crash that destroyed so many lives.  While the story with Jack and Rose are fictional, the rest of the story around that is pretty on factual from the historical documents I've seen and read.<br /><br />I realize they lump all reviews throughout the different versions of Titanic available.  The one I'm reviewing is Titanic (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)

0517548232|5.0|First, let me make it clear that I am an economics major, pursuing a BS and hoping to continue my education with either a PhD in Econ or a JD. I say this only to indicate that I have some degree of knowledge of the subject matter at hand. Despite studying close to 3 years of economics, Henry Hazlitt's magnificent work, Economics in One Lesson, is still a valuable resource. Even Keynesian economists will find something of value in this legendary introduction to Austrian economics. Whether you are a layman or a college educated economist, I'm sure this classic work will  be of some worth to you.<br /><br />Positive Aspects:<br />1) Hazlitt is an excellent writer. I can not imagine an economics book that is more clearly and concisely written.<br />2) Hazlitt is, for the most part, absolutely correct. Despite what you hear in modern media, government intervention is, in general, harmful to the economy as a whole.<br />3) The chapters are short. Anyone can sit down for a few minutes, read a chapter or two, and gain some knowledge relevant to economic discourse.<br />4) Compared with other works on economics, this book is something of a page-turner. You won't be bored to death trying to deal with complicated mathematics of graphs.<br />5) A wide variety of topics concerning government intervention in the economy are covered. Amazingly, nearly the entire book is relevant to modern discussions.<br /><br />Negative Aspects:<br />1) Some of the arguments in Hazlitt's work are simply too brief. His reasoning doesn't always feel fully fleshed out, nor is he always charitable to the opposing viewpoint.<br /><br />In conclusion, I feel Hazlitt's book is somewhat impossible to summarize. I will attempt to do my best. Anyone who is even somewhat interested in economics will benefit from reading this book, whether or not they agree with the author's conclusions. It is a classic economics introduction for a reason, after all. I would recommend this work to anyone who has even a passing interest in economics. Don't take my word for it, though; buy this book, and let Hazlitt speak to you.
0525953728|3.0|Two thirds of the book pretty standard SEAL-type war stories highlighting a few missions, the training, and the importance of training the SEAL team mentatlity.  Last third of book of course dedicated to the actual mission which was gripping.  Highlighted how well trained and focused these guys are to the point they are almost robotic.  (Loved the line describing VP Biden when they were officially recognized after the raid.)
B007GCY8FS|4.0|The book did drag on a bit, and as some posted there was too much time spent in cars.  Hopefully this and \\"The Affair\\"-similarly \\"very good but not as good as we're used to\\" aren't signs that Lee Child is running out of ideas.<br /><br />Despite all of that, I blew through the book very quickly.  I can't get enough of Reacher and this book quelled my thirst.  I'll preorder the next Reacher book whenever I can and I'm assuming I will read it within a few days of it becoming available.

B000AM2L1O|4.0|Just got this for my daughter and she seems to like it (1 1/2 yrs). She really loves the open/close eyes. The doll itself has a nice expression although to me her eyes are very small. She has a soft body which is very nice to cuddle. I'm not too thrilled about how they attached the head. I little flimsy looking. Overall she's pretty darn cute.
B0055SWM08|5.0|As with so many of the best puzzlers, Quell's gameplay and controls are simple.  However, the peaceful setting for the game does not mean all the puzzles are easy - especially if you're going for a perfect score.  There will be times where you will choose to gain some small satisfaction from deliberately destroying your water drop as you realize that this attempt to reach a perfect score will be one over (for the tenth time in the past half hour!)<br /><br />Solid challenge, fun to play - I've already picked up the sequel.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Like many, I'm a long time Dylan fan-having seen him in concert many times through the years and owning everything he's ever put down on celluloid or digital cd content.  I've tried to not compare/contrast his works post 60's period because he's changed and evolved many times over.  Actually, the breaking point for me is anything done after Dylan's motorcylcle accident in 1966 whereupon his return to the music scene showcasted a vastly different voice and articulation.  He's had his ups and downs both musically and artistically, and I know we all have our own personal favorites.  You won't hear me suggesting that Tempest is one of Dylan's greatest efforts in his entire catalogue as other's have done in this Amazon review forum, rather I compare it favorably when looked at in contrast to his \\"later day efforts\\".<br /><br />On the positive side Tempest is a return to lyrical content that makes you listen word by word, unlike his previous release \\"Together Through Life\\", of which I found to be a great dissappointment.  I won't quote the lyrics here, other than to say it's back to a stream of consciousness spewing of sometimes disjointed thoughts and words-which is a Dylan hallmark.  I can't and won't attempt to define or interprt the lyrics, which is part of the mystique.  Dylan's current stream of consciousness wording is done in a snycopated fashion that maps into his snarling and raspy vocalization, almost a beat by beat pounding out of the lyrics.  Outside of a few well spun direct stories like the title track, these songs are indeed full of dark and ominous musings of which no definitive interpretation can be held-again part of the wordsmithing barrage done so effectively so many times by Dylan.  This is a return to lyrics, and a return to content that makes you listen and think and feel.<br /><br />I like this CD, and I'm sure on many  more listenings I'll like it even more.  The instrumentation is sparse as is the production-there are very limited full off riffsand or solo efforts either via guitar or piano and there is nada a harmonica note.  While I'm sure this very basic effect is one that suits Dylan these days, I feel that a bit more \\"oomph\\" out of the backing band would have made this a far better effort.  To me, some of Dylan's best later day works include \\"Infidels\\" and \\"Oh Mercy\\", among others.  I know I'm not the only one that has credited Daniel Lanois for his excellent production work on Oh Mercy which brought out not only front and center Bob's preaching vocals but also expertly weaved instrumentation that added to the mood/feeling.  Again, I like Tempest for it's return to Dylan snarling stories of intrigue with some very nice melodies that match his current vocal limitations.  It's a good and enjoyable effort, one that will stand the test of time and make for long-term listening enjoyment-but I can't rate it a five start \\"later day classic\\" effort....rather four stars, which indeed is a fine rating given Dylan's own 5 star standards over the decades.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I enjoyed this game on my PC  and I am enjoying the game on my Kindle. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys match games.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was enjoyable and entertaining.  I felt it went round and round the same circle but I still wanted to read the second book.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I LOVE this AWESOME movie!! It has so much action and suspence!  This is one of my (personal) FAVORITES!!  Please get his movie!!
0345404475|5.0|My husband and I absolutely loved this book! It has all the things we want in a sci-fi book: depth, human introspection, action, and we grew philosophically from the topics in this book. If you love literature quality science fiction but not young adult then this is the one. Truly. I'm not sure why young adult books are in the same section as this book. I hate that science fiction is now synonymous with young adult books which lack depth and quality of introspective writing. Anyway, I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a quality read.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I played the whole thing all the way through.  It is an ok game as it kept my attention.  It is worth the price of admission, trying to be like myst.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've had it on my phone for years &amp; it's just as good on my kindle fire (if not better because the screen is bigger).
B005EGXTEE|5.0|This is a great book to read, even if I am a little bit older than a teenager. Enthralling and hard to put down (read it in 2 days). Way more insight into what makes the characters tick than the movie (as usual).  Definately should have read the book before the movie, it would have made a couple of things a bit clearer. Most certainly a keeper.
B005LAII6M|2.0|As a fan of the RE movies and Anderson I hate to say that this one stinks.  I also hated his last film The Three Musketeers.  I've grown tired of the Flash and no substance film making.  Is this Resident Evil or the Matrix?  This film is a mess and it lost me from the very start.  Milla looks great as always but the action is way over the top.  Actors look pretty while standing in the open firing their weapons.  Trust me as a fan that this is the worst of the bunch.  Sad to say this won't be the last.

B004TUKNX6|5.0|My first Rush album that was given to me by my Dad when I was 15, was Moving Pictures.  Now a die-hard Rush fan, I can easily say that I know how annoyed people get if you try to push Rush on them. I know, its a real struggle. But Moving Pictures kind of has this immunity from the anti-Rush Venom. Everyone will - AT THE VERY LEAST -enjoy the first half of this album. Everyone born after 1982 has fondness for the album built into their DNA. The first half is enough to hook anyone into the masterful musicianship of the Canadian veteran power trio named Rush. Those adventuring souls who choose to pursue further find a world of atmospheric storytelling that is unmatched in music. It's the album that's changed my life by making me want to deviate from the norm. My senior quote in my high school yearbook is \\"Changes aren't permanent, but CHANGE is.\\" Anyway, the Grammy-nominated pieces on the album are individual gold, that earns this album many fans and five stars.<br /><br />There is a point in Rush's documentary when Jack Black says that each band has a resevior of \\"rocket/rock it\\" sauce... some bands use it all at once, some on just one song. But Rush's righteous bottle of rocket sauce was so big that they shook it literally for decades, and there's STILL stuff pouring out in their new album, Clockwork Angels. THIS ALBUM IS WHEN THE BOTTLE SHOOK HARDEST.
B005FISBTO|5.0|This was the best season yet!!! The end of the final episode, O-M-G!!! Talk about a cliff hanger! Loved the mix of religion with it. Can't wait until the next one.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|Saw them in person at the Peabody Opera House in St. Louis-same show.  They are fabulous and get better as they get older.!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Movie was well made with good acting~really would have liked it to be longer so all the great parts from the book could be shown.  Looking forward to the next 2 movies.
055357342X|4.0|I love this book.  I love this series!  However, this book especially was VERY heavy on details.  I love that I can picture every single thing in George RR Martin's head but this one is so steeped in detail I can tell you what color thread is in the clothing of every character.  So be prepared to slog through a very detail oriented fun adventure ride.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've installed this app on my samsung blaze smartphone, my laptop, and my android tablet. There is nothing but ceaseless perfection so far. I've noticed the sync is flawless, the app is extremely user-friendly, and those in combination make my world an easier place to be.<br />Thanks for making my OCD tendencies for note-taking much easier to live with ;)
B008LZHA3G|5.0|My favorite Dylan songs have tended to be the long ballads. If you're a Dylan fan, you know the ones I mean: \\"Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\\", \\"Jokerman\\", \\"Brownsville Girl\\", \\"Desolation Row\\", \\"Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts\\", \\"Mississippi\\", etc. This album has some really good, long ballads, maybe more than any of his other albums: \\"Scarlet Town\\", \\"Tin Angel\\", \\"Tempest\\" (my favorite, almost 14 minutes long, about the sinking of the Titanic), and \\"Roll on John\\". Dylan reminds me a little of Johnny Cash, who recorded some of his best music in the last years of his career. Dylan may do the same, if this album is any guide.
B004EI924E|5.0|Wonderfully funny movie!!!  Great cast! Has a lot of excitement through out the movie.  It's definitely a movie to watch over and over again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It freezes every once and a while. But when it works I love it! Glad to gave it on my kindle fire.
B0043X1FOK|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie!  It was just as funny as the first one.  Was so sad when Johnny Five was battered so bad that we thought he was dying. A good ending.  Loved it!
B0081KTI0E|4.0|I read the Woman in Black a few years ago and liked it enough to seek out the movie.  The one available at the time was good and a fair representation of the book.  I really liked this adaptation as well -- I thought Daniel Radcliffe did a surprisingly good job of separating this character from the Harry Potter character.  My husband felt that the movie had only 1 tone - bleak and morose.  While I didn't disagree, I thought that that well matched the book.  I wasn't thrilled with the ending, but overall, I felt that this movie captured the essence of gothic quite well.
B000W94FE6|5.0|Excellent consciousness investigations given in this book. After reading I find myself more aware about my thoughts and it's causality.<br />I've enjoyed this book a lot.
B0087HT36U|4.0|good game but it should be free and not a dollar... its not worth it for a dollar good graphics and everything else though
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Five stars to counteract the religionists who wanted God to come over the hill in an SUV. Tough movie. Should have had four stars for not quite the character development (another survival story--but no William Bendix anywhere) everybody thinks it had, and somewhat plotless action (but what could you do?)--very tough, a first for a godless Ben-Hur where it ends with the race and callous revelation. Tough-minded, and with several interesting twists (the jerk who doesn't stay a jerk OR become a hero, the role of a Bergman-like Death around everyone--his woman who dies (predictable) but tells him not to be afraid, killing the wolf at the beginning, wolves get him in the end, almost killing himself, guiding the fallen passenger to his death, etc.). In short, not one of the great ones, but a genuine adult film that doesn't pander to American cavalry-or-God endings, well worth watching. By the way, it doesn't say there isn't a God, just that He doesn't work the way we expect Him/Her/It to, i.e. it is not an atheist film per se. Just realism--why do intelligent beings expect an infinite God to lead the cavalry.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't put it down until finished. It is a great primer on that period in history. I look forward to the next book as a review of the period it covers. The characters were intriguing and a well rounded look at life as lived. This was my first book from Amazon on my Kindle and a great start.
B007MAET4O|5.0|What a great album from Mayer.  I will echo what others have said about an album you can just sit and relax with.  I don't think there are any bad songs (\\"The age of worry\\" pushes my personal taste on the bad song scale).  Stand out songs:<br /><br />Queen of California<br />Shadow days<br />Something like Olivia<br />Born and raised (both versions)<br />You know what, I can keep on listing songs but the whole album is just great...<br /><br />The fact is, John can crank out a pop song that will rock the charts in about 10min. If you're looking for that, it's not the album for you. However, if you sit and listen to the album I think you'll find that you like it.  The songs are beautifully layered and rich in tone.  I purchased the vinyl Version of this album.  If you have a turntable I highly suggest it, the album is a great pressing and it includes the full CD version of the album as well.<br /><br />I look forward to what's next in John's musical journey!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I would like it better if there were some categories. Some way to tell what it is first. But there are a lot of choices.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am totally obsessed with Pinterest to be totally honest. I get so many great ideas! It really is a fabulous app/site!
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|The book needed a couple rewrites at least. There was way too much exposition and a lot of it was unrelated to the story. The main character needed something more compelling to make him likable. Just being a uber-80's geek doesn't automatically endear him to people who grew up in the 80's. And when did the main character have time to master EVERY arcade and video game from that period, as well as learning EVERY word to EVERY 80's movie and EVERY 80's song? That was too unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy a lot of the nostalgia, but after a while it became grating and tedious. One last thing: the writer has Lucas-idis. That means he was too in love with his sci-fi world. He didn't need to describe every last button on his spaceships or computer screens. Five paragraphs describing how he walked out of his spaceship just wastes valuable reading time, when \\"I left the spaceship and...\\" would work just as well.
B00005JM20|5.0|Although this movie has been around for a while, Rowan Atkinson has always been funny, and this movie is, too.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Fantastic reading! I read it from cover to cover in one sitting. I couldn't<br />put it down. In my opinion, a definite must read for teens and adults who like<br />fast paced what will happen next stories.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the multiple choices for sounds. I love that you can mix and match them. The humming setting helps my 6 month old sleep. Great app.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is still just as good as the other two; but winds down a little more... the ending is ofcourse best of all I ATILL recommend.  Epic Love Story!
B000002LPD|5.0|For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge is an excellent Van Halen album and by far, their best with Sammy Hagar. It's a bit heavier than their first 2 with him and he shows a lot more potential here than before. The songs aren't as poppy and they take the synthesizer out of their music which they have been using since '84. Judgment Day is an awesome opening track and a perfect start for the '90s, don't believe all the bad reviews that people gave it because they're wrong.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is just as good as the first, the same lustful, and dark romance filled.  Plus the suspense still keeps your head in the book!
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark's songs are so strong, they can stand and hold their own in this rather \\"lean\\" production.<br />It's great how Irish and American traditions blend here.<br />It's not lean at all - it's rich.<br />DJ's working for radio stations might be scrambling for that \\"hit\\" on this double cd.<br />Good luck - the whole album is designed to draw you in slowly and there are none.<br />Pick any song - they are all hits.<br />Boom - just like that!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|EPICALLY GOOD! It not only woo's you with fantasy love and romance but it's dark and is very suspensful.  I could not put this book down!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Worst written book I've ever experienced. Much like watching a bad movie. Once invested, you feel obliged to see it through to the end.
159562015X|4.0|excellent book for assessing the strengths of your employees. The \\"themes\\" the author uses to categorize the strengths of employees make common sense and are based on scientific research. I've always subscribed to the idea that people naturally tend to gravitate at work towards their strengths, by either transferring, promotion or leaving the company. This is based on my own observations during over 35 years of work experience. The premise by this book to strengthen one's talents and do not try to compensate for their weaknesses through training and education makes a whole lots of business sense and will save money and resources. By considering employees talents during the hiring, training and promotion stages results in a win-win strategy. The Company can allocate their resources more wisely and the employees will be happier in their work, resulting in increased productivity and improved employee morale. Al Calvo
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is so great. It's free! The ads are nothing. Draw with your friends! It's just too fun. Good drawer or not, you'll get completely hooked on this game!

B007SSEU9O|5.0|Meryl Streep is amazing in Iron Lady. A very good actress anyway, this is one of her best works.<br />The point of view (recollections of an aged Thatcher) is genius; it makes the film pop. Thatchers aging is done with taste; nothing tacky.<br />There are good history lessons: reminders of what has gone on. Seen from the British point of view. Make no mistake, this is a character study, not a history lesson - but you can't avoid seeing history when studying a former Prime Minister.<br /><br />The download from Amazon to TiVo was flawless. I ordered from the TiVo Search function, TiVo contacted Amazon ... later the movie was waiting for me on the TiVo. I don't know how long the download itself took: it probably did not occur within the next five minutes. I should pay attention, I guess.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I just loved \\"Gone Girl\\" and thought I would backtrack and read some of the author's earlier stuff.  I couldn't imagine more despicable characters than the two main ones in \\"Gone Girl\\", but geez, the folks in this novel made me feel in need of a shower after reading their story.  Fairly good as a thriller, just kind of yucky.

B004GBFF5Y|4.0|A sweet story of a young teen who semi-contemplates suicide and finds himself admitted to a psychiatric ward where he meets varying degrees of mental stability.  He is befriended by one of the more stable patients who kinda guides him through it all.  Meanwhile, he discovers his new friend isn't all bravado after all and has his own personal pain.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is great! it shows how much you have left, and is super easy to use!  it shows up when you plug it in, and lets you know how much time you have left.
B007SSDDWE|5.0|The show played very well. The quality was excellent. Would definitly concider streaming another movie via amazon. The Darkest Hour was action packed and full of excitment. You never knew what was going to happen next and it was very unpredictable. My only hope is that there is a second to this one because the ending does leave you hanging abit.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I have been playing this gameon my kindle fire with no problems other than it took a while to load.  I think it is challenging, fun and definitely well worth $0.99!!  graphics are well done and the game lasts a long time.  I would definitely recommend it to those who enjoy hidden object games with a good story line and one that challenges your imagination.  thumbs up!!!
B004UID2LC|3.0|its a great app untill recently were it just tells me that the video cannot be displayed because of connection problems. i have usualy 3 or 4 bars while running the app please fix the problem...but a great app.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Ok, this is going to be a tough one. This book is simply put fantastic teen literature. From the start to finish, amazing. The book starts off with Vaelin al Sorna, or as he is better known, Hope Killer being taken into port. It builds up the fear and hatred of this character to an amazing amount, and then gives us this child, many years younger being given away by his father. The idea of the Faith was beautifully conceived and its Orders and Aspects were amazing as well.<br />  This book has several plotlines, more than other authors could handle, but Ryan does it perfectly. He keeps a few plotlines running to keep the readers interested, while ending the extra ones, or the ones that he is finished with. The characters in this book are perfectly well done. We learn to love them, or hate them depending on what Ryan wants.<br />  I can't go through this book without talking about killing. Vaelin faces internal conflict between killing (right or wrong?) and killing versus murder. He comes close to murder, and kills many but everything works out against him in the end.<br /> His battle with the Shield that the entire book leads up to is ... short. He quickly defeats the Shield, to the amazement of many, and lets him live (honestly do the main characters ever kill them?) and walks away. Many would say that this is bad, but it shows you just how underestimated Vaelin is, and makes you respect the cold, angry, and human character.<br />So all in all this book hits all the points, plot, character, cliffhangers, drama, action, romance (you'll have to read it), and ends a superb book. I cannot wait for book 2. Authors, new and old, this is a perfect example of a teen fantasy novel. Anthony Ryan, I salute you.
0385343175|5.0|Danielle Steel as always, at her best.  It held my interest to the very end.  And as always a surprise ending.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|The songs are perfect, vintage Dylan. However, I only know that because I finally downloaded it from itunes. I pre-paid for it on Amazon, it came on Sept 11th, with one side of the case smashed since it was packed badly. (read: thrown into large box, no bubble wrap around it, along with a heavy chrome banana holder, also with no wrap taped around it. There were just a couple chunks of loose billowy plastic wrap. I called - they were to send it next day - a week later, still no CD. They said it was a \\"glitch in the system\\" during a  20 min. long talk with a pleasant lady in the Philippines. She kept apologizing for that, and for the \\"long wait,\\" but it was still like talking to a robot. I finally just got a refund. I'll buy a hard copy somewhere else. It was supposed to be a special Sept. 11th gift and then a special Sept. 12th gift but that never happened.....bad on you, Amazon. And stop turfing customer service off-shore. It's hard enough that you have to do a Google search just to find your customer service phone number....
B000B5XOYI|5.0|The Dark Night series is unbelievably good,  But you gotta love the classics.  This set is great for anyone who enjoys that comic book feeling style of entertainment. Its also great for anyone who loves critiquing who pulled off batman better. Micheal Keaton did the best all around performance but he was a little up staged by his brilliant antagonists. Danny Devito's steller performance as the love deprived mutant \\"Penguin\\" man, Certainly creeped me out as a kid and conitnues to make me cringe as an adult. Jack Nicholson does a great deranged two face with comical villianism coming out of his ears. And NO ONE plays cat womman like Michelle Pfeiffer<br />The newer instalments, brought us cool new tech and stimulating computer graphics but truth be told the story lines were a little weak.  But we do get to meet the spunky teenage rebel Robin, played by Chris O'donnell. All though Val Kilmer  wears the mask Better than his succsessor, George Clooney's performance and chemestry between himself and his co-stars made for a far more entertaining sequal.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey is an impressive new writer, and you will not be disappointed with this book.  (Well, a small percentage of people will.  No doubt some people hate Ray Bradbury's works as well.)  What did I enjoy about it?  Lots of little things.  Almost complete real-world believability of everything that is happening.  Last time I've seen that was in Kim Stanley Robinson's books, and no offense to Kim, but Wool is more gripping and interesting.  People's motives and personality being explained via actions, not dialogue or expositional narrative.  That's cool.  You'll excuse me for being vague, but I don't want to give away one delicious bit of the plot, because you will hang on every electronic page wondering what will happen next, and when small pieces of what may be an interlocking puzzle are revealed, you'll gasp, heart in mouth, hoping that your hunch is correct.  At least, I did.  Let's see? What else?  Spectacular use of language, and yeah, I didn't reference Ray Bradbury randomly.<br /><br />Pick it up already.  Smell the solder, the grease, hear the clang of boots on endless metal stairways.  I don't want to say more--the less you know the better.  I'll leave it at that.
B007T5K2I4|4.0|I like the weird and unique, the different, when it comes to music. Even if its unique and popular :) I haven't bought Jamiroquai in a while, but after hearing Rock Dust Light Star (the song) and White Knuckle Ride I had to purchase.<br /><br />It's Jamiroquai, its EMD meets dance floor soul anthem. Who else can give you that old Motown feeling and make it feel current and cutting edge? This is a great album to groove to, especially if you work in an office environment (like I do). When I want to plug in and groove to be productive and make the time fly, Rock Dust Light Star is one of my go to albums. The head starts to move, the shoulders to shake, and the feet to tap the minute the first song starts and doesn't stop until the end.<br /><br />Favorites:<br />Rock Dust Light Star<br />White Knuckle Ride<br />Smoke and Mirrors<br />All Good in the Hood<br />She's a Fast Persuader<br /><br />If you are a fan of Lenny Kravitz's 5 album (ie the songs like Live, Black Velveteen, Supersoulfighter, etc) you will def dig this album.

0525952616|3.0|KILL DECISION (2012) is a contemporary SciFi-Spy-Thriller.  I like a lot of the ideas regarding autonomous unmanned air vehicle technology, but many times the details get too far-fetched.<br /><br />The main theme of the book is that one part of the US government is carrying out or backing attacks on US interests abroad and at home - apparently for the purpose of getting massive funding approved for building up autonomous unmanned killer drone technology.<br /><br />The \\"heroes\\" of the story are a covert operations team, that is tasked to stop the scheme... with a lady college professor, who specializes is killer ant swarming behavior simulation software, being recruited for her skill (as her software has been commandeered by the bad guys, to form the basis for the autonomous small killer drones' behavior).  Having an extensive background in software, I can assure you that, in practice, this \\"heavy re-use\\" of the professor's ant-swarming software algorithm, to form the behavior of the ten's of thousand's of 2-foot and 5-foot size \\"killer drones\\" isn't just \\"far-fetched\\", it is actually absurd - especially given the time-frame of the story (the software is \\"swiped\\" and \\"re-used\\" in the new application in a matter of weeks)  ... and the \\"pheromone message exchange technology\\" is just plain ridiculous.

B008ZOHCKE|2.0|OK for basic entries,  but I can't find access to open more than one entry per notebook. Not very useful for notes on one subject over multiple dates or for more than one sub-topic. Locked up during first use and had to force quit. Still has bugs on Kindle Fire.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|easy yet not too simple. good for passing time. a bit repetitive at times but entertaining. you wiggle ur way around the grid to match the colors.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|I loved the app. It worked great on my Fire. Downloads were quick &amp; easy. It has quit downloading anything. Keeps saying to download patch update but it wont download it! Tried to download video, but keeps saying video expired download error. Enough to make me UNINSTALL from my device.
B001O1O71C|1.0|I saw the movie a few weeks ago and was absolutely enthralled. The movie is a rich moving experience. I decided to order the book to get the rest of the story (so much is generally left out of movies) and  I was sorely disappointed. There was an amazing lack of character development on every single level.<br /><br />It was very 'simply' written -  maybe for a young reader? If so, the writer assumed its young readers would not be able to handle much more sophistication than a Dick and Jane book.<br /><br />I don't know where the critical acclaim for this book comes from unless it is simply an attaboy for writing about the subject matter.<br /><br />I would definitely not recommend buying this book. However, if you have the opportunity to see the movie, do not hesitate.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|A very quick read, clearly written with easy-to-follow methods to improve communication. The lessons in the book would help most anyone learn how to make others feel comfortable quickly. It also would, I think, help someone who wondered why strangers might shy away from them or otherwise don't respond to them the way they'd hoped.<br /><br />I think the thing I liked most about this book is that one key emphasised several times by the author is to be genuine and truthful. Although any communication technique could, theoretically, be used to manipulate others, when the advice in this book is taken in the spirit in which it's delivered, it could quickly help anyone overcome communication and even relationship obstacles with a simple shift in presentation and how we listen to each other.

081297381X|4.0|One of the best business books I've ever read from a brilliant, cynical, humanist statistician.<br /><br />SUBJECT<br />The book is a philosophical rumination on human cognition- i.e. what do we think?

0321714113|1.0|IMO, this book is for the more experienced programmers or to be used with an instructor. As a beginner trying to learn C++ on my own, the code snippets used through out the book doesn't help me a lot. I need to see the whole program to help me learn. Yes, there is a download of some the programs (not necessarily all) used in the book available but it doesn't help me if I do not want to turn on the computer. That's why I bought a hard copy of the book & not an ebook version. The lack of the complete programs in the book is the main reason why I gave the book a low rating.<br /><br />The C++ Primer Plus by Prata is a better beginner's book because Prata includes complete programs through out his book. However, the Lippman book is more readable than Prata's book. I like the content organization better on Lippman's book as you do not have to wait \\"until the end\\" of the book to learn more \\"advance\\" coding syntax.
034580404X|5.0|These books have been given a lot of review, some unfair, if you haven't read them all then you will not understand, the under story that develops and the sad abusive treatment of Christian as a child is significant to understand this trilogy. I considered it routine sexual encounters as opposed to \\"housewife porn\\" as I have seen it referred to.  And as far as bondage goes, it is really Dominance/sadism and really pretty lightweight when compared to reality. Read them all.

B005J4TLQG|1.0|Huge disappointment after reading so many positive reviews.  This movie is a mess...the alien looks like a Teletubbie with glowing eyes and has rabies.  First 30 minutes consisted of teenage hoodlums roaming the streets of London, drug dealers, and rap music...3 things that I don't want to watch for 30 minutes straight.  Really bad movie.  Do not buy or rent.
0439813786|4.0|At first glance, the format of \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" reminded me of the Harry Potter books I used to read when I was younger, but as soon as I had turned the first pages I knew that this piece of art was not like anything I had encountered so far. The story of the 12-year-old orphan Hugo, who lives in the walls of a Paris train station in the 1930s, is so powerfully written one can easily relate to the protagonist's all too human feelings and desires.<br /><br />It is incredibly difficult to classify this book into an existing category. Even though its amazingly drawn illustrations might qualify it as a picture book or a graphic novel, it is much more. It is cinema in the form of a book. Large parts of the story are told in pictures so that the reader can find his or her way into the story very easily.
B004LWZWDS|3.0|This movie looks the same on Blu-ray as it does on DVD.  No improvement at all in picture quality.<br /><br />No reason to upgrade from DVD to Blu-ray in this case.  Save your money.
B008CP6RWU|4.0|This is the kind of game that redefines video games. There are no quests, weapons, coins to collect, or princesses to rescue. It's more like playing a poem than a game.<br /><br />While you can complete the main adventure in no more than 3 hours, there isn't a wasted moment in all of it. I found myself smiling with delight from start to finish. At times, it was like being a hiker, at others it was like being a bird or a fish. The variation in each new phase was astounding, keeping the entire experience fresh and new.<br /><br />There is some limited replay value, and the other two games (Flow and Flower) are magical in their own right. All in all, it's absolutely worth owning. I think that Journey could have been longer or given more replay value by giving it multiple paths to its conclusion, but it's hard to complain about a game when it's such a joy to play.<br /><br />It comes with extra 3 mini games, PS3 themes, and bonus art.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|The great Bob Dylan is 71 and has just released a solid gold album. True, his voice is a bit raspy at times, but, of course, it was never about sweet vocals for Dylan. His strength is in his magical lyrics woven into catchy tunes. It's all there in this album.<br /><br />My favorite track is \\"Duquesne Whistle.\\" After I listened to this CD a few times, I found that tune sticking in my skull. It's got a driving beat, like the train that it glorifies.<br /><br />I predict that there will be many covers of these tracks, and I'm sure there are many performing artists listening to these tunes and saying to themselves, \\"Right on, Bob.\\"

B0012QTT4O|5.0|I first heard about this series in 2011. I watched the Pilot and then immediately watched every episode of every season available. Then waited impatiently for Season 5 to air.<br /><br />Breaking Bad breaks the mold for television shows, taking TV to a new dimension in creativity with writing, acting, directing -- everything connected with an idea becoming a show. It's not an evening soap; it's closer to reading a great novel, only I don't have to find my glasses first.  It's more intense, compelling and entertaining than a well-written book.  Often I'll read a book more than once, but I see or hear something new each time I re-view episodes of this show.<br /><br />I've now watched Breaking Bad, from Pilot to the last episode available, at least four times and probably more.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like?  After the next season, the show ends. Can't say enough good about Breaking Bad, from the title and premise to the acting and the actors' love for their work on it -- but no spoilers here. If you think you can guess what happens next, you're wrong unless you answer, \\"The unexpected.\\"  Yet the quality of Breaking Bad makes suspension of disbelief possible, taking me places I didn't think any fiction work could get me to go.<br /><br />Thanks, Breaking Bad, for breaking TV's tired formulas, lifting the bar and demonstrating what's possible when an entire team (including the cable network, AMC) commit to excellence in their work.

B004LKVHSY|5.0|I disagree with all of the reviews that panned this movie.  Its not to say there weren't plot holes, but the concept is compelling!  After his wife and son leave him after his drinking problem goes out of control he loses his job so he moves to Las Vegas to kill himself by drinking himself to death.  He meets up with a hooker and they start to form a bond that slowly turns to love.  Her pimp gets killed, she gets raped, she loses her apartment and just as she experiences love for the first time she finds him cheating on her in her own place!  She kicks him out, then she forgives him and he dies!  The music by Sting is awesome and is perfect for a modern day film noir!
B004EPZ070|1.0|Way to ruin a good book. Hollywood couldn't live with the basic principle of having characters that weren't \\"good\\" so they changed the basic premise.<br />When is Kate Hudson ever in a good movie anyway, so I should have known.<br />Maybe if you haven't read the book and catch the movie on a day when nothing else is on it's acceptable. Otherwise you will be majorly disappointed. I guess Giffin was so flattered or starstruck she wasn't able to keep them to the integrity of her book.  Felt slimy after watching it so I turned it off midway.

B0053KWDES|5.0|I purchased this heaphone amp to match up with a pair of Sennheiser HD598's.  It is a great product espically for the price.  The amplifier will bring a clarity to your music that you just can's get through your standard headphone jack.  I use my at low volumes as well as high to keep the clarity in my music.  The battery life is AWESOME!!!!!!! I have seen a lot of people complain about how you can't charge it while you use it but that doesn't bother me at all.  Just set it in a USB wall charger at night and it's good to use for a few days.  Excellent product for the price. I use mine with my MacBook Pro and it sounds awesome.  I also use it with a COWON S9 and thats great too.  For the money I recommend this product to anyone looking for that little extra.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 1.5 out of 5<br /><br />'The Hunger Games' is an amalgamation of many films and TV shows we've seen before. For starters, the long-running reality show 'Survivor' comes to mind as a good part of the film is set in the forest where the characters must rely on survival skills to survive. The film's premise, in which children and teens between the ages of 12 and 18 must fight to the death as part of a televised spectacle, is reminiscent of 1998's 'The Truman Show', where Jim Carrey's entire life is put under the microscope of a reality show, broadcast to millions.<br /><br />The setting of Hunger Games is a post-apocalyptic dystopian future similar to the 2010 British film, 'Never Let Me Go'. Both films posit a future where a society of mindless, brainwashed automatons are unable to rebel against a totalitarian system that calls for deathly self-sacrifice of the young. With all the characters adopting such a one note conformity, there's very little wiggle room for any kind of interesting drama in the film, which relies more on the cheap thrill of watching teenagers attempt to do themselves in vis-a-vis mortal combat.<br /><br />The rulers of the post-apocalyptic country we're introduced to, 'Panem', are more like unpleasant fops from an 18th Century Louis VI French court than the ineffectual pacifists of the 1993 sci-fi satire, 'Demolition Man', starring Sandra Bullock. And our 'common folk' protagonists 'Katniss' and 'Peeta', from 'District 12', remind us of an Appalachian setting, similar to scenes from 'Winter's Bone', the same film in which the Hunger Games' star, Jennifer Lawrence, was nominated for a Best Actress Academy award.<br /><br />The Hunger Games takes an interminably long time before we get to the meat of the story. The reason for this is that the film's scenarist, Suzanne Collins, seeks to extract as many tears as possible from her teenage audience, by dwelling on the victimization on the protagonist's younger sister, Primrose, and Katniss' sacrifice, when she volunteers to take her place as part of the Hunger Games. Can the cold-hearted leaders at the 'Capitol' be stand-ins for parents in general, as the 'kids' appear to be completely at the mercy of adults who hypocritically claim to be acting beneficently on their behalf.<br /><br />The Hunger Games won't begin until we're treated to the next long-winded sequence where the principals are introduced to the public via the big media broadcast. The criticism of the media here seems to be all too obvious but Stanley Tucci is effective as the foppish master of ceremonies. Like many of the 'twists' throughout Hunger Games, Kantniss' dress catching on fire during her TV interview, hardly seems fantastic at all. If you want better 'magic', check out any Harry Potter flick instead!<br /><br />Finally, we get to the meat and potatoes of the film--the fight to the death between the kids. One immediately thinks of a futuristic 'Lord of the Flies' here. Interestingly enough, director Gary Ross's herky-jerky style prevents us from really experiencing the full import of the violence. On one hand, that's commendable since the film's basic premise is wholly unappetizing. On the other hand, it prevents the film from being suspenseful, as the violence doesn't seem real, suggesting that these characters are also not real people.<br /><br />Hunger Games finally morphs into a completely dopey and comical spectacle as the teenagers (aided by the surly establishment) attempt to do one another in. As the games begin, the kids begin hacking each other with machetes. The rest of it is completely derivative including a dull computer-generated fire, a wasp nest falling from a tree, booby-trap explosions, more computer-generated nonsense (a pack of gnarling hounds), poisonous berries and a fight to the death on top of a weird sculpture called 'Cornucopia'.<br /><br />If this isn't ridiculous enough, at a certain point, the powers that be declare that there can now be two survivors, provided they're from the same district. This turns out to be a ruse and the new rule is rescinded which lead the protagonists to threaten mutual suicide. Although the bulk of the people are depicted as enjoying the spectacle of the mass killings at the beginning, the authorities now fear that a mutual suicide may cause unrest in the districts. Hence, the basic rules are changed, and now two are allowed to survive, instead of one.<br /><br />As Jennifer Lawrence appears to have signed on for three more Hunger Games sequels, she'll probably be set financially for life. Whether her overall reputation will survive after acting in such drivel, remains to be seen.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is really designed for young teenagers and older, less sophisticated teens who have little interest in reading anything resembling what any reasonably educated adult may refer to as 'literature'. It's a film that's mostly devoid of 'ideas' and appeals to devotees of soap operas, who always seem to end up entranced with one-dimensional villains and heroes or heroines, that inevitably end up on elevated pedestals!hat be declare that there can now be two survivors, provided they're from the same district.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a heart warming story about having the courage, determination and fortitude to do something you have never done before.  The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry considers the plight of the Fry's marriage, what could have been and what it has become.  Harold and his wife each learn a great deal of about themselves and each other while Harold is on his pilgrimage.  Throughout the book I wondered if I could have taken on that journey.  It was a story that I could not wait to get to the end....but I did not want the story to end. A very nice read.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I have read all of Lee Child's books and was looking forward to his next one.  \\"A Wanted Man\\" certainly did not meet my expectations.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|some parts were a bit slow (boring), but the story line was great. It was well acted and for the most part, really kept you wondering who was going to be next. I've watched it twice now and came to the same conclusion both times, I would watch it again.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read the whole book, but I was happy it ended.  The characters were real enough.  The story was depressing. You have to ask, Is this what America is becoming?  I hope not.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|perfect basic calculator for desk use -- subtracting my check register,  etc.  I like the large keypad and simple format -- just right for everyday needs.
0920668372|5.0|This book is sticky sweet. I love reading it to my children who are now 8 and 6 and have since they were born! Gets me every time too. That lump in my throat and my eyes get blurry! We love it still though! A must for every child's book shelf!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app has been excellent for me! It works great, no complaints here. Super fun and easy to use. I even found some things I didn't know I could do before
0805047905|5.0|I loved reading this book to my twins as much as they loved hearing the rhythmic words and seeing the bold beautiful pictures. A classic for sure. Highly recommended.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Very good movie.  Leaves a bit to be desired at the end but it is definitely worth the rental fee.
B008B0QH5S|3.0|As most of the other reviewers of this item, I am a \\"Very\\" long-time fan of the PSBs.  They are without a doubt my all-time favorite group, without a close 2nd.  I have every album they have made, and most singles (and B sides).  After recently buying the \\"Winner\\" single (which I like \\"ok\\" but not crazy about), I found one of the B sides to be an amazingly fun, dancy, classic PSB track (\\"A Certain Je Ne Sais Quoi\\").  Wow, if that is a B-side, I couldn't wait to hear the album songs!<br /><br />Well, the wait is over, and after giving it is couple of listens, the jury is still out.  The first listen was borderline terrible, to be perfectly honest.  However, as many of you know how it goes, the 2nd and 3rd listens started showing a couple of promising tracks.  But continued listens have left the majority of the tracks in the \\"skip\\" category ... I will be giving the steering wheel radio controls and thumbs a workout with this album (yes, us \\"old school\\" listeners who still prefer CDs to MP3s, ha!).<br /><br />Anyway, the good:<br />Track 1 - Leaving - a nice introductory track with a catchy but not overwhelming beat.  The only part I didn't like was the sampled \\"dog / keyboard voice\\" section, which definitely has the 80s sound but not really in a good way (I do get a smile at that part since it reminds me of Ferris Bueller playing his sampled keyboard with throwup sounds, but now I'm really digressing and showing my age!).<br />Track 2 - Invisible - this is your classic slower / complex / introspective style PSB track.  Very \\"Behavior\\" reminiscent; it would have fit right in, and wouldn't surprise me if they had an old shelved demo that they brushed off and polished for the album.<br />Track 3 - Winner - an acceptable track that I have listened to enough to \\"learn\\" to like it.<br />Track 5 - A Face Like That - another excellent track, classic PSB stuff!<br />Track 12 - Requium - this one reminds me of some of their better B-side tracks (has similarities to \\"Between Two Islands\\").  I can't say it is my favorite, but for some reason it is the one that is stuck in my head before going to sleep; a nice inventive addition to the album.<br /><br />OK - so that makes 5 of 12 tracks that I like.  Which leaves the remaining 7 tracks as what I will call \\"the bad\\".  Some may continue to grow on me, but others will just remain work that should have been left to a future B-side collection (in particlar, I like the meaning behind \\"Ego Music\\" but listening to the repetitive \\"yes yes yes\\" lyrics is, well, painful).<br /><br />In comparison to past albums, I realize that this pattern of only liking a few songs is my typical reaction, and it takes time to \\"digest\\" the remaining ones.  I loved the last two albums, so I would would put this one on-par with \\"Release\\" or perhaps \\"Bilingual\\" as being towards the bottom of the list.  But of course those albums had some real gems, and quite frankly I am happy to keep buying PSB products as long as that keeps them coming up with new material, even if some of it is \\"Hit or Miss\\".<br /><br />In summary, if you are a \\"true\\" PSB fan, I would recommend buying this album, but go into it without expecting to like most of the songs.  And if you are on a budget, I would highly encourage you to pick and choose and just buy the individual songs that you like.  Thank you for reading!Islands\\").

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|good movie but lacking some of the material from the book. it could have been a lot better overall<br />characters were good
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great app runs smooth never crashes. lots of levels and at times very challenging. would recommend checking this app out to anyone who likes sword games.  lots of upgrades and weapons provides hours even days of fun
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Well developed characters and wonderful plot.  I will definitely be buying the next book when it comes out.  The dual story telling of the main character and the scribe does not make the read cumbersome as I have seen in other books. Very rich narrative, and I found myself reading the entire book in two sittings.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|kindle fire users....<br />iit works fine til youu update iit.<br />iit doesnt work for me at all anymore which annoys<br />me cuz iits one of myy fav. apps -.-<br />now ii needa replacement.

Basically its amazing!!!!<br /><br />FOR PEOPLE OUT THERE YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!..........
B000JIJPZY|5.0|Both of my boys have used this playmat and have loved it!  I prefer it to the larger ones simply for that fact that it fulfills its purpose without taking up too much space.  Both of my kids have loved the detachable parrot.  I love that two of the toys can be moved to different locations.  The head support doesn't seem to serve much of a purpose once baby can move around.  It has kept both of my children entertained and held up extremely well.  I have washed the playmat, and removable toys many times, and they still look brand new.
B000JIHP88|1.0|I tend to think negative reviewers come from negative people, but this product really is shoddy. It looks great and operated beautifully for 3 weeks before the motor stopped working (i.e. the leaves stopped rotating and opening/closing; the music and light still work though). I threw out two sets of batteries assuming that was the problem.<br /><br />Choose a different mobile because chances are you won't have time to deal with the warranty or get a replacement mobile once your baby arrives... I wish I had heeded that advice from other reviewers.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down!  I read the book in 2 days and started on Book 2!  I would recommend this book, I just wish there was a book 4 now:)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|brings back the memory's when I played this in school. it's a must try for those who played the original.
0061122416|5.0|Awesome book! Loved it! I was glued to the book for 2 days straight and it really made me think about my own personal journey and things that happen along the way.
0525953728|5.0|This is a well written first hand account of a day in the life of a Seal. While it is aimed at UBL raid, it is much more in depth than that. This book offers a great insightful view into what our guys in the military (obviously Seals but you can draw an understanding of all) sacrifice to ensure we're safe and our liberties remain in. Details the training and day-to-day activities to the relationships and lifestyles these men live. Loved the book, thank you for setting the story straight and for your service!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was one that my friend pushed me into reading. After finally giving in, I sat down to read it, and I have to say; I truly regret not picking it up earlier. The story is relatable on so many levels, and also is one of the most deep books ever. It even gets emotional. Another fear I had on reading the book was being a guy. I really expected a girly level. Again, I was wrong. This book is actually easily a dual sex story. Please do not skip out on reading this. It is amazing
B0084B5TK8|4.0|After reading for 55+ years, I thought it about time to read the \\"real\\" Dracula and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The book is intriguing and suspensful without being gory or bloody. A lot of history about Dracula is given and  the book also explains why he does what he does.<br /><br />The book is written as diary entries by all the major characters; gives great perspective.<br /><br />The only negative comment is that some of the journal entries use less than proper grammar (he has brain of child, he weak, etc.).  This detracts from the otherwise well-written book.
B0064W65SO|1.0|I've loved this book since it came out in late 80's. I am tired of collecting paper comic books, so buying Kindle version seemed attractive, but it turns out a digital nightmare. The images are so poorly compressed that it is hard to read hand-written monologues in the graphic. Artificial fonts on pop up screen are fine, but as for graphic, you can see digital noise from compression in any edges on characters. As for the additional material for this 2005 version, those noises are just horrible on pop up screen, and resolution is ludicrously low.<br /><br />Those digital graphics novels must be checked by publishers or artist, otherwise should not be allowed to sell on digital format.
B00095NX9G|5.0|years ago i heard someone in the SF tribal community publicly suggest rachel brice needed to \\"smile\\" more. like what? a hooker? i, myself, thought she just was working her own badass \\"attitude\\" as we all must when we dare to swagger out as ourselves.<br /><br />but as a reformed performer, artist, and writer who's on a mid-life rampage through the rest of my years here, i was also wrong. i now see that rachel's taken the art of performing, being objectified, to a new level of \\"i'm doing my own hot thing, and if you wanna enjoy it, fine. but this is for me first and foremost.\\"<br /><br />and good for her for not \\"smiling more.\\" we ought to be lucky if she merely acknowledges us at all.<br /><br />the other day when i was turning a dancing friend onto her work, i accidentally found a video clip of her without her ubiquitous heavy makeup mask on, and was astounded at the sacred intensity that emanates from her soft feminine face. no wonder all the eyeliner! I GET IT! she'd be eaten alive if she went any further to make us all feel at home with her epic talents and sexuality.<br /><br />and thank you for showing us all things we can never possibly do like you. but it's way more than \\"smiling more\\" for us when you dance like that. i'm relieved that it's on video. for that i'm grateful once again to your producers at world dance new york for such a high quality production that befits your work.<br /><br />thank you again and wow. what a gift.<br /><br />and you all, who cares if you ever can do ANY of this. just WITNESS her! once again it's her bringing fire from the gods that we even get to TRY.<br /><br />don't get this to necessarily copy her. that's not the point. if you want another zumba workout video to make you wear out the living room carpeting, walk on by. get this DVD to witness, enjoy, and maybe even TRY to vaguely emulate what she's doing in the hopes that you'll do the rain dance and end up wherever she goes when she's doing her own thing. it's bliss. it's what we artists get strung out for. it's god, y'all. it's channelling all of time and there is no \\"genre.\\" only what this individual did with their time here.<br /><br />talk about such epic gifts.<br /><br />you did way, way more than \\"smile more\\" miss rachel. thanks. do this life and art thing however you want. let the cabaret girls \\"smile more\\" and dance for the tips. you're cavorting with the gods.<br /><br />smile whenever you damn well please.<br /><br />and thank you.<br /><br />--erika lopez
B0085776BG|4.0|This film was exactly what I expected and a great diversion while not overly taxing intellectually.<br />I find it too bad that Amazon does not provide closed captioning with its films. My hearing isn't what it used to be, and I find closed captioning very helpful.
B000092WD8|1.0|My son got a part in this musical at our local high school so I ordered it to surprise him.  Unfortunately I was the one who was surprised.... when our DVD player refused to play it!  Apparently this is a \\"zone 2\\" DVD, designed to be sold and played in the United Kingdom and western Europe.  Why this company is sending this product to U.S. customers is beyond me, maybe they're hoping that I'll just consider it a bad deal and throw it away.  I mailed it back, my review of the company will depend on how (and if) they credit me.
B00000269M|4.0|MJ had so much talent, but also protected in what producers would tell him...listen to the fans, well-done LP, not complete in everything compared to past masterpieces.
0307948110|3.0|This is my first Harris novel.  I've enjoyed the movie adaptations of several of his previous books.  I would guess that Fear Index probably was not to the level of Enigma or Ghost Writer but it was a very fast pace interesting read.  The novel take place over a 24 hour period in the life of a PhD ex physicist running a Hedge Fund purely by algorithm.  The build up was rather good but the ending was somewhat flat.  This is a very much a plot driven book rather than character driven.  I enjoyed it and think of it as more of a 3.5 even with the flat ending.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|I was debating whether or not to post a review on this one, since I am not a Dylan fanatic. My background basically goes back to when his Rolling Thunder Revue played in my neighborhood and I could not score a ticket, but thankfully have some video of that tour on Bootleg Vol. 5. Little did I know at the time, that this would be the end of his most favored output from 1963-1976 in the period of his life between ages 22-35. When I finally got to see him live in 1981, he wore a mask and deliberately distorted the sound so that he would not get ripped off. I thought that this show really stunk, and it would take me many years before I began buying the best years of his back catalog besides Before The Flood. Then I saw him again in 1999 shortly after his comeback (which I thought was highly over rated), and this show was better, but nothing to write home about. By then I realized that he was never known to be a performer, but a poet and songwriter with a vast amount of influences. He also created records to satisfy his own artistic desires (for the most part), and to hell with what his fans expected of him. Always keep them guessing. The third and final time that I payed to see him was in 2011, which really stunk.<br /><br />By this time, I was truly amazed at the amount of Dylan fanatics in the audience who thought that their hero could do no wrong. Most of them were born after Bob's heyday. I was glad to not be a a part of this group. Was I missing the boat?  If so, let it sail somewhere else, since I have better things to do with my time. It amazes me that some thirty years after his heyday, his fans still try to analyze his lyrics while Bob is just probably snickering at all of the misinterpretations. I am convinced that when one writes intelligent lyrics and at least tries to make them accessible, there will always be numerous misinterpretations no matter what.  Now add the ingredient of deliberate vagueness as Bob likes to do and the audience will almost never guess what the intention was. They can pretend to figure it out all they want, but they wind up being the ones to miss the boat. We may never know what Bob was thinking when he wrote all of his songs, and frankly I feel that it is none of our business. He keeps enough of his dedicated fans always guessing, and they are happy with this. To me, it is what it is, take it or leave it. I have also learned to never argue with a Dylan fanatic (staying one step ahead on the comments).<br /><br />So given that I have admitted to not being a Dylan fanatic and have only bought the Freewheelin' to Desire phase, as well as Infidels and Greatest Hits Vol. 3, why did Tempest catch my attention enough to buy it? Well, as a few others have noted, Duquesne Whistle reminded me of Louis Armstrong, and the video was quite playful and amusing. When the soundclips were released, I saw enough playfulness in the<br />songs to warrant buying it. When I got it, I could not stop playing it. The magic of this release is the playfulness of the music (sometimes monotonous, I admit) juxtaposed over dark lyrics. It also appears that Bob and I finally agree on something: when faced with pending mortality, joke about it! In the style of calypsoian music that uses major key music set to minor key lyrics, Bob pulls this one off in my opinion. If it were not for the two sleep inducers included here (Scarlet Town and Tin Angel), I would give this one 5-stars. Still in all, not bad at all for being 71 years old and still recording 50 years later. As for his voice, yes it is gone, but actually works quite well with these songs. Being a fan of Ryan Bingham's young whiskey soaked voice, I cannot fault Bob's voice on this one. I applaud his courage and I am sure that this won't be his last release.

B005LLSNNE|5.0|Love Sons of Anarchy. Such a good job. Loved that I could buy the season and have it sent directly to my TV.
B009329Y30|4.0|The movie is well directed and well acted. It also, has a great plot. I really enjoyed this movie and think so will others.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|I haven't been so moved by a film in a very long time. Meant to see it on the big screen; had to wait until it was on HBO. Will now buy it as it bears watching more than once.<br />How was this movie not chosen at The Academy Awards?!?<br />The acting is exceptional - by every cast member. Every moment is compelling. If you have an emotional vein in your body, you will be swept up in the story. If you're looking for mystery/action/thriller, move on. If you care to be touched, watch.<br />The film gave me the ability to feel tied in with others closely affected by 9/11 - without having to watch newsreels or reality shows or listen to narratives or political theorists - rather simply identify with how it affected us.<br />Totally satisfying.<br />A superb cinematic catharsis.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|Despite myself, this film grabbed my attention and kept me interested throughout.<br /><br />I always enjoy seeing Ron Pearlman, even in a smallish part (as is the case in this film).
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was 5 star for me, all the way up to the ending.  It was enjoyable reading and I would still recommend it, I was just personally disappointed with the ending.
1250010489|5.0|The author's 2nd book (in this genre, at least) and the second time he has made me stay up waay past my bedtime multiple nights because I could't bear to put it down! As a fan of tech thrillers, I have to say he is one of my favorites.
B005I64U66|5.0|Horrible Bosses.... Is hilarious.... I hardley ever watch a movie twice and if I do it will months or years between.  I have watched this 4 times in the past month.  It just cracks me up...  I bet these guys had a blast making this movie.  Great cast and love Jamie Fox.<br />Elizabeth Raley
1401300529|5.0|Excellent book, well written, well thought out, well organized, and well researched. I would highly recommend purchasing this book, I found it unbiased and very informative.
B002RPR6DU|4.0|I ordered this movie because I loved it when I was younger. The special effects are really outdated but I still fall in love with the robots. It also gives a perspective on what could be on Earth without plant life. Something to think about.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is one of those books that you will open the first page and be unable to put it down. A book that you will shelve to read time and time again.  A story that will stay with you way past the last page.  Why ... Because it's a love story with hope. As Disastrous as it seems, love is never black and white.<br /><br />At 5am in the morning, I'm reading away heavily engrossed within the storyline and completely and utterly gob smacked by Travis, and this compelling story of love.  I asked myself is this normal to like a guy who is dysfunctional - who has issues etc. But the way in which Jamie has scribed him is just compelling. Everyone deserves a chance at happiness. Right?<br /><br />Travis is the bad boy your mother always warned you about - Womanizer, good looking, tats, buff and bold. But - this hunk of a man has two sides to him. A side that he portrays as bad, uncaring and callous and another side he never knew ever existed within him until he meets Abby.<br /><br />Abby has moved away from her home town to start a new life and make a fresh start, to move on and live her life away from the dramas left behind. Until she meets the school Jock - at a fight meet. Here her life changes.<br /><br />After losing a bet with Travis, Abby and he embark on a friendship that no one deemed possible. Travis has taken Abby under his wing, forming a friendship that builds into love. They both try to deny the building friendship and love growing until everything that never seemed possible to Travis happens. He meets the one!!<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster takes us on a whirlwind of emotions and events.  Jamie has mastered the emotions so well; I'm sure in certain places you to will be wiping away that tear, or even gasping at other moments, and even sheepishly grinning at others.<br /><br /> A relationship that seems disastrous yet inevitable. A Beautiful Disaster.<br /><br />To be loved that much by someone may come across as possessive but when Travis loves he loves hard.  When he hates or is angry it's rough. Jamie has not portrayed this romance as all flowers, hearts and chocolates, its rough - hard and guts wrenching at times, it takes work and patience and of course a lot of loving.<br /><br />The characters have all been created with flaws; no one in life is perfect.  I found this Very realistic it happens in everyday life.  Jamie certainly has defined her characters with such depth you can't but help be sucked in there world. Feel all there heartaches and hope to the book gods above that it all works out and we get that happy ending. I must say I wasn't so sure at many parts within the story. So of course I was compelled to read on and on and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I personally loved Travis - he is my new heart throb - protector - my Conan the barbarian. He comes across maybe dysfunctional, possessive, aggressive, and dangerous at times, but I as the reader can see the love he feels for Abby. He has found love after many years of never having it, it tests his patience, resolve and everything he never thought possible.<br /> A love like that doesn't come by every day.  The romance made me melt pine and sigh many a times and I even wanted to bitch slap him at one stage! But they say we are out worst enemies. ;)  The chemistry between Abby and Travis was smouldering, volcanic and heart-warming. It turned me to goo many a times.<br /><br />Beautiful disaster will pull you into the pages, have your heart palpating, you will be gasping, sheepishly grinning and even wiping away a tear or two. It will take you on a rollercoaster ride; you will feel many emotions throughout this story.<br /><br />Grab a copy for yourself, I'm so glad I don't buy a book based on others reviews, because this book certainly gave me more than I expected. It's dark and haunting at times, but Abby was strong willed and determined and stood her ground. Not once did she do something she didn't want to, or did Travis ever harm her like portrayed in reviews. He was aggressive, dysfunctional in his own ways, but love does funny things to some people. Jealously being number one...<br /><br />A fluent flowing storyline that will capture you within its grasp until you have turned that last page and  : sigh .rayed in reviews. He was aggressive, dysfunctional in his own ways, but love does funny things to some people.

B00727AM3Y|5.0|Great Book! I read it in just a few days, and found myself fairly connected with the characters. I did think that it ended a little abruptly, but that's probably how it is supposed to feel given the main topics, and storylines.

0547564651|5.0|This is the most revolutionary book regarding child development I have read in my 61 years as an educator. Paul Tough skillfully and extensively explores the progressive new idea that character--qualities like persistence, self control, curiosity, conscientiousness, grit and self-confidence--matters more in a child's growth than cognitive development.<br /><br />He draws extensively on studies--like the seminal ACE study that reveals how deeply most of us are affected in our lives by our adverse childhood experiences; the famous Stanford University \\"marshmallow\\" test showing how the decisions of four year olds could predict how they would conduct their lives; the long term affect of rat parenting in handling the stress of their \\"pups;\\" the study that reveals the non-value of the G.E.D. The list goes on; with the scope wide and fascinating.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Mr. Tough visits programs across the country that are addressing their students with character based programs. It is impressive how deeply he imbeds himself in these programs and in particular how extensively he describes Kewauna, one of the students in the Chicago \\"OneGoal\\" program, whom he follows from high school into college.<br /><br />Paul Tough makes a very powerful case that our schools and homes need to begin to place a higher value on character than cognitive development. Thus I was disappointed that his \\"better path\\" summary seemed weakly focused on teacher quality. Character is inspired, not imparted; you don't pour it in, you draw it out. This means we need to develop a society of teachers and parents who model qualities like persistence, self-control, curiosity, grit and self-confidence. Since we were all educated in a cognitive value system, we will all need to make a personal transformation to some degree.<br /><br />All in all, a truly exceptional book, whose value to us is in the league of Tom Paine's Common Sense. The fact that this educational book has been near the top of the best selling list ever since it was published is remarkable and a sign it is hitting a nerve with Americans.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|For all the hype, the book is badly written, rhetorical and sadly lacking in originality. A recycling of better erotica from better places 60 years ago.<br /><br />I really wonder, did she get anyone to proof read before going to press? And if not, how did it get past the editors at The Writers' Coffee Shop? Did they proof read it..... oh, hang on. they probably did.<br /><br />No real publishing house would touch this right?<br /><br />I wanted to give this 0 stars but could not.

0783225482|4.0|Death Becomes Her is a brilliant allegory on the quest for eternal youth, all in the name of vanity. Two women, rivals Madeline and Helen, both have their eyes on the same man, plastic surgeon Ernest. When he leaves Helen for Madeline, Helen descends into a breakdown. Finally, she comes up with a plan to both get Ernest back and get back at Madeline. Obsessed with her failing youth, Madeline resorts to desperate measures to retain her youth - she drinks a magical potion that will keep her forever young. The trouble is, with eternal youth comes immortality, even when dead. To make matters worse, Helen drank the potion too, and poor Ernest finds himself in the middle of the mess.<br /><br />Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn are excellent as the bickering rivals, and Bruce Willis surprises as the long-suffering surgeon married to the wife from hell and her rival from Hades. The film's theme of the obsession and pursuit of youth no matter what the cost is powerful. The special effects concerning the half-dead half-alive Madeline and Hellen are stunningly convincing even to this day (well deserved Oscar for Special Effects).<br /><br />I warn you, though. The squeamish of you may have trouble watching some scenes, where Madeline and Hellen are impossibly damaged but still alive and feeling nothing. But sit through the movie to see a well-presented allegory on vanity.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. its super addicting and easy to play. deff would buy again. I just wish it wasn't so hard to get points after a while

B0098VYCCE|1.0|This movie was 2 hours long well let me tell you it felt like 4 hours.  It was slow and very boring.<br />Everyone said it was such a great movie.  Well I am glad I didn't see this in the theater.  I don't see<br />what the big hype is about Kristen Stewart.  I think they could have found a prettier Snow White.  That<br />might have saved her relationship with Robert Pattinson.  Overall not really worth your time unless you want to take a nap.

B0079XNWQA|1.0|I bought this CD simply because of the song, \\"I Won't Give Up\\".  I love this song, but I was very disappointed in the other songs.  I did not like any of them.  They don't even come close to the song I like.  Doesn't even sound like the same singer on most of the songs.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had twists in it that were very interesting. It did take me awhile to get into the book but once I got to the twists in the plot, I quickly finished it.
1451696205|5.0|A great coming of age book. I only wish I new about in high school so I could do a book report on it. I don't usually read for fun, because I can't find a book that keeps my attention but this book kept me engaged the whole time. I can't wait to see the movie.

B0012GMWCU|5.0|It's all been said here already...<br />All these classic songs written by Willie Dixon and so ingrained throughout the world; in different scenes; different styles; different cultures; but sung by, and made so popular by, so many OTHER singers/bands.<br />Of course some of those other singers include blues legends like Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, etc; people who also make up the 'I Am' in the blues.<br />\\"I Am The Blues.\\"<br />Okay, Willie, I'm not going to argue with that, but can you sing your own lyrics, powerfully, with conviction, joy and sadness all at once while you play your great bass-lines used in so many classics, too?<br />\\"Sure enough, yes I can.\\"<br />Well sir, Mr. Dixon, you are the blues...
B0080CKGZE|2.0|Only reason why I gave it 2 stars is for the cast that's it. The book was just as bed.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Loved this book!  I see an individual counselor who recommended this book to me.  In the past, I have been to marriage counseling with my husband.  I found that this book helped us more than any of the marriage counelors that we have been to by far.  Highly recommend it to couples before they get married or to couples that may have been married for years such as myself..........28 years.  Wish we could have read this many years ago.
B0087HT36U|3.0|I downloaded this app for free. it seems fun enough. my seven year old and my four year old like it enough to occupy them for a good 20 minutes.
B0055Q5F36|1.0|I received this case and it's absolutely a rip off. I have t mobile galaxy s 2 and it was impossible to even get this on my phone. It just doesn't fit. I know some of the things are off about the case, but this just literally would NOT fit my phone. The buttons don't even come close to lining up. DON't BUT THIS PRODUCT! They won't even help you out by taking it back. They want me to spend almost as much as I spent on it to send it back. Rediculous and awful.customer service. I will be doing everything I can to have the shut down!

B006LSZECO|1.0|Got into the story, thought it was going to be a great mystery - if it were a paperback instead of on my Kindle, I would have thrown it right in the trash! I thought I had found a new author, but I will never read another book by this author. One of the worst books I have ever read. Cannot believe this is so highly rated!
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|Excellent movie that arrived quickly after I ordered it.  A great family film for all ages.  We had guests that we shared it with.  We all loved it.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Others have said it better than I shall---still---I want to add my five stars to the long list.<br /><br />IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHICH ONE IS BEST, JUST NOTICE HOW WELL THIS ONE HOLDS ITS $-VALUE (the used ones ask as much as brand new copies, or they'd be more, I'm sure); NOTICE HOW MANY OF THE THE NEAR 500 COMMENTS ARE FIVE STARS!!!  (NEARLY 400!!--with a relative smattering of lower scores)<br /><br />I LOVE THE CHEMISTRY AND SUBTLE BELIEVABILITY OF THE LEADS.  RUTH WILSON AND TOBY STEPHENS RULE!!  THEY'VE GIVEN DEPTH AND MAGIC TO THE ROLES LIKE NONE BEFORE--IMH0.  DO love the others! Several are wonderful; but THIS version conveys the magic of this particular romance with so many nuanced and believable interactions it just stands above all the others---again--IMHO.  I simply adore this version!  I just can't praise it enough.  (I've never seen Rochester so well portrayed. Same for Jane Eyre, tho' I've enjoyed several others very much.)<br /><br />ENJOY!!!<br /><br />I've since re-watched this version---and I have SO much to say, yet I'll try to be concise:  Ruth Wilson is just breathtaking in how much she communicates without a word.  It took re-watching it to remember how rare and vital an infusion of character this affects.  Her nuanced performance is more an embodiment than acting---and that in the rarest sense.  I've rarely in my life--and I've spent this life as a movie enthusiast--found so rarefied a 'performance'.  Never have I seen Jane played to palpably, so embodied a Jane as elicits profound appreciation for who Jane really is and why; and---how they came to fall deeply in love.  It's obvious in this version beyond all the others--as I recall.<br /><br />NOW---the hesitant confession:  I've never read the book--but, please, before I'm too harshly judged for that, simply let it be said that I JUDGE THIS ON THE WELL KNOWN STORY, and in context of (rather than comparison with) the almost countless other versions--many of which I've seen two or several timeseach.  Before I started this I'd just watched the proposal and their intimate talks before going shopping.  I thought to myself:  \\"I don't care what was written in the original book unless it's at least as wonderful as this movie version.\\"  That is how I feel about this movie.  I still love most of the other versions, but this one is the one that IS \\"Jane Eyre\\" to me.  I wish to one day feast on the book, but with severe A.D.D. it's really hard for me to stay put with books.  Meanwhile, I'll come here for bathing my romantic heart & temperament in \\"Jane & Rochester\\".<br /><br />Before I go--I just can't say enough about how similarly, palpably Toby Stephens expressed Edward Rochester.  I can barely believe the chemistry and how well it was embodied in these two unforgettable performances.  In other versions, to varying degrees, I couldn't quite buy-in to how he intentionally, recklessly misled Jane to do with his marriage issues, not to mention the wondering why she loved him SO--given his temperament & near-cruelty.  In this version, thanks to Toby's incredibly nuanced embodiment of Rochester, I could not only see why he held off and tested on so many levels for so many substantive reasons, why his nature was compelled to test the waters until the moment he knew FOR CERTAIN that she was UTTERLY in love with him; but, also, that it was OBVIOUS HOW & WHY THEIR NATURES CAME TO SO ADORE EACH OTHER---like no other version I recall---at least not quite like this one.<br /><br />Oh,well.  So much for being concise.<br /><br />If you prefer other versions I can only hope you love them as much as I this one.  Thanks for your time.  Bill, Evergreen, Colorado
B006LSZECO|4.0|My daughter recommended this book to me as she read it for her book club one month.  The first chapter I found a little difficult to navigate until I got into the rythym of of how it was written.  After that it went much more smoothly.  I had never read a work by this author before, but I think she did a fantastic job of keeping the story moving and then pulling it all together after the twist and turns.  The characters were very interesting, especially Amy, of course, but the author did a nice job of developing the background characters too.  It is a bit of a bizarre story, but I would highly recommend it to people that like some mystery and criminal intrigue.
B005SJIP1E|5.0|After comparing the recordings in this edition with their counterparts in the 2001 edition of this sterling set, I'll add my attestation to the improved quality of the sound.<br /><br />This latest remastering leaves this listener with the sense that the original recording venue has, in a virtual sense, been shifted to Carnegie Hall.  There is a fuller depth in the sound \\"stage\\"; there is more air around each orchestral and choral voice, which improves the clarity of the performances; the sometimes cringe-inducing glare of the strings in the upper registers has been softened; the bass has more presence.  Overall there is an almost indefinable sense of the sound having been polished.  The works with choral writing have particularly benefited from the improvement: the sections in the tutti passages in the Eighth Symphony, for instance, are more distinct, raising the comparative quality of this recording several notches.<br /><br />Those who might feel deprived because this edition doesn't have the Das Lied von der Erde with the Israel Philharmonic needn't.  In any event, as noted elsewhere on this page, that recording can be had for a reasonable price.<br /><br />This remastering keeps this set central in the classical music catalog: at this price it is the ideal choice for anyone who is becoming acquainted with the Mahler oeuvre; still essential for classical music collectors.<br /><br />Those who wish to read more about this set in its remastered glory are referred to the Arkiv Music website.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I loved the movie. There were a lot of thing from the book that were in the movie. And some things weren't in it but that's ok not everything had to be in it. <3
B002APU580|5.0|Will definitely be buying this movie after seeing it and reading the book. This movie had excellent adaptation and great casting.
B007K3JFUQ|1.0|When I opened my shrink wrapped DVD it did not have the typical security tape on the top that has the name of the movie, but did not think much of it at the time. After I tried to download the digital copy with the code provided inside of the DVD case I was informed that I have exceeded the number of downloads already. It appears the seller might have used my download code first. Now, I only have the DVD but am unable to use the digital copy I paid for. Very unhappy with this seller!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This is a well-written book about Scott's journey to ultra-greatness.  It brings the reader in close, so you can get a sense of what Scott is running for and running from.  Well done.

1476712042|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is by far one of my favorite reads/books I have ever experienced. I say \\"experienced\\" because this is more then a story. It's an experience.<br /><br />The characters, Abby & Travis, are very unique.  Travis is the touche, fighter, tatooed, wrong-side-of-the-tracks bad boy, famous for his one-night stands.  Abby is a \\"good-girl\\" with a past (major plot twist).  Abby wants Travis. Travis wants Abby. Neither one of them want to make a move as they each have found a unique comradery that would make most \\"good-girls\\" squirm. But alas, Abby really isn't the \\"good-girl\\" now is she.<br /><br />Supporting characters are equally intriquing with great supportive roles. Mcquire's character development is one of the best parts of this novel.<br /><br />Book has already been sold to Warner Brothers for future movie- sure to also be a hit- well, if they stick to the storyline.<br /><br />This was the first book since the Twilight series that had me re-reading chapters, sections, and then finally the whole story: over and over.  Author Jamie McGuire shows her talented writing skills in her first novel destined to be a New York Bestseller. Oh wait, it already is!<br /><br />Strong language, violence, sex scenes.<br />Contemporary, Adult, Romance novel.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is the second time I've read Will and Layken's story.  I read Colleen Hoover's novel immediately after she self-published it on Amazon.  I had seen others talking about it over the internet and found the synopsis interesting.  Now, I am a huge Avett Brothers fan...I mean, I'm from the South, and it would be sacrilegious not to be a fan...anyway, I had heard they were mentioned in this book, although I didn't know in what form, so I was curious.  I originally rated this story with 5 stars on Goodreads.<br /><br />This time, I was fortunate enough to secure the Simon & Schuster version via an ARC through NetGalley.  I was curious if a big publisher like S&S would change the book in some way...really, I feared that they would take away from the story.  Did they?  No, they didn't.  This story is just as heartfelt and emotional as the original version with very little changes to the detail.  I only wish I had more than 5 stars to give this beautifully written love story from the imagination of Colleen Hoover.  The paperback publication is due for release on September 18.  I am an avid e-book reader; it's just my preference.  However, I recommend you run to the nearest bookstore and secure a paperback copy.  You won't regret having that printed copy on your shelf.<br /><br />There is a sequel, Point of Retreat, which I also gave 5 stars and highly recommend.  Colleen is presently working on Will's story...not a sequel, but Will's pov.  From what she has shared on her website, you will not want to miss it's debut.<br /><br />I'm not going to spend time with quotes and other diddle in this review.  Instead, I hope to try to put my thoughts into a poem....for Layken, Will, and Colleen.<br /><br />I read a story once about a girl in pain<br />Her heart was ripped beyond recognition<br />Her life was torn apart as she knew it<br />Yet, she had to survive<br />She had to live<br />She had to go on<br />She had to meet the boy.<br /><br />I read a story once about a boy in pain<br />His heart was ripped beyond recognition<br />His life was torn apart as he knew it<br />Yet, he had to survive<br />He had to live<br />He had to go on<br />He had to meet the girl.<br /><br />I read a story once about star-crossed lovers.<br />A boy met a girl and love happened.<br />Then Circumstance reared its ugly head<br />and charged in with a mighty sword<br />to cut their love deeply.<br />It shouldn't happen!

B007KOYEOC|4.0|good read, love having kindle for PC made it so accessible which was great considering how addictive the book is!
0525478817|4.0|I'm not much of a reader so if I finish a book, I must like it.  I read this based on a friends comment of how it was life-changing for them.  It really was a good book to read.  The only two things I didn't care for was 1., what other reviewers said about the way these teenagers spoke.  It is on a level of scholars and not teens.  I took that with a grain of salt and it didn't bother me but I had to keep in mind this isn't how any two teenagers would ever talk.  The second thing was, it was depressing for the most part.  And the part with Isaac in Augustus's basement was...well...downright horrifying to me.<br /><br />I have a teenage daughter (13) and I don't think I would want her reading this just yet.  I also thought about telling my mom about it but then decided against that too, since my sister, one of her children, died of cancer in her 40's several years ago.<br /><br />I finished it with a good feeling.  It will most certainly affect my attitude towards life.  In a good way.
B0043JDUNS|1.0|Iron Man 2 had some of the worst dialogue of recent memory. Characters often talked, but there was never an indication that a character might actually be listening. The conflict was forced and the plot loosely strung together - there was only some small redemption with a few solid action sequences.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Great Book!!! Could not put it down because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. First time I have ever read her books and will purchase more.
B006L9B6TI|3.0|The Magic is very informative. It tells you how to live very positive, you can achieve the things you want in life. Don't dwell on the negative things, think of the positive and always thankful for everything. It has inspired me to think differently, my attitude towards things are different, and it gives me things to look forward to. Great book.

B000003TB6|5.0|I have to say I don't listen to much hip-hop or rap. Most of it is so contrived and ridiculous these days that it isn't even worth a casual listen. It's all hoes and dollars and totally stupid. Irony is a powerful thing and I don't want to dwell on it too much but lately The Roots are really no better than most. This was made in a completely different time and I think many would agree it is one of the best albums ever regardless of genre.<br /><br />This on the other hand is brilliant stuff. Proceed to witness some of the greatest beats and rhymes to come out of the culture. There isn't much else I would compare it to for creativity and soul but Public Enemy, OutKast, etc. in some respects. Sure, some of the gangsta rap as I like to call it has some worthwhile beats and lyrics but so much of it got caught up in all the most worthless things humans mire themselves in.  Violence, money, sex, etc. Nothing wrong with singing about these things but when it becomes all you are about you become a parasite to it. It guides everything you do. Tupac started out brilliant and just steadily drove himself off a cliff imho. He still remains relevant but I cannot help but dislike what he and others like him became.<br /><br />From cuts like Distortion To Static and Lazy Afternoon to the title cut there is a lot to love here. The Roots are something else entirely from most of their peers and it shows. These guys are just some good old-fashioned hip-hop updated for a modern audience and this is one of their best and one of the best. Other reviewers more familiar with the genre can make better comparisons and insights I just know that this is one of the few artists in this genre I will listen to with pride.
B007N579X6|5.0|It's a great show, and with the 3D effects, it just amazing! Well recommended show! there is a lot of content in the bluray.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This is one of the most engrossing TV series I have watched.  There are consequences to rationalizing wrong actions! Hank is by far my favorite character, great guy.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I take a ton of pics of my baby with my phone and this is a great program to edit them quickly<br />and easily! Recommend it for anyone who needs to rotate a pic that they might want to post to facebook or send in a text. The crop function is cool too. Love it!
B001RLP862|5.0|It costs as much as 5-7 regular cheap decks, but the quality and durability of this deck is worth every penny. Finally, no more replacing whole decks thanks to moisture damage caused by careless players.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. the weather is much more accurate than the weather channel. I use it every day. highly recomend.
B003XTUZIM|5.0|One of Crimson's best in my opinion and a bit underrated by some of the fanbase. It might not have the ferocity or pure visceral punch of such records like In The Court... or Discipline, but it has a truly elegant and timeless style and the lyrics are utterly fantastic and quite spirited. People nudging it for being bad poetry have no idea what they are talking about. These are very good lyrics for musical accompaniment for the most part.<br /><br />Formentera Lady remains one of my all time favorite cuts in the history of music, and the rest of the album is necessary in every way. Ladies of the Road is clearly having some fun and was mistakenly taken for selling out or some such idiocy back in the day. I just think most people were not ready for this one. It was quite a departure from previous works but you can definitely see pieces of this in their other releases.<br /><br />Islands remains a bit of an outlier in the entire catalog, they rarely if ever play any of this stuff anymore and the band was broken fairly quickly, though still enjoyed a decent tour and run. Remains one of the best records ever made to me. It may be scattered and each song may exist separately but people miss the point when they say there is no theme here. I think through the lyrics and the dreamy atmosphere one finds many different tones and themes that add up to a very coherent whole.<br /><br />At least in my book. The new mixes are gorgeous in high-def audio. They did such a great job with all the 40th mixes. They are definitive in every way. You will never need another release unless they figure out how to put the master tapes in your house with the band as holograms. Not even sure I'd be into that but it may be possible in a 100 years or so.<br /><br />TONS of extras on this disc: 5.1, an entire Alternate album made of different versions and additional rough mixes in 24/48, both 30th and 40th masters in 24/96, and some other assorted takes of Formentera and Ladies.... You can't ask for much more. Worth every penny. The new mixes are crystal clear and beautifully done. The old mix of Islands now sounds positively tame. You can immediately tell the difference in A/B playback. The new version just brings all those instruments to light and demands a rereview from those that didn't give this a fair shake. If you want the old mix it is there too. KC has done audio right here.r much more. Worth every penny. The new mixes are crystal clear and beautifully done.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent - couldn't put it down and am moving quickly through the next two!!  A must read for everyone, no matter what age.
0345803507|5.0|Ok I will admit it.  I love a happy ending.  I am a total sap for things working out and everyone living happily ever after.  I had to stay up all night to read book 3 because that's how I am... all or nothing.  It is so addicting.  Well in book 3, Christian finally has a break through.  He finally realizes that Ana truly loves him and would never leave him again.  There are some shockers that I didn't see coming but it wraps up nicely.  Again it is a fantasy.  What I really appreciate is the epilogue that is included.  Provides insight into Christian and ensures us of the future for Ana and Christian.  Loved it!
B009329ZF2|2.0|Too many things in this movie just wouldn't happen - and I don't mean anything about the space invaders - do they except us to believe a floating museum would be kept armed and fueled and ready to go to battle - I don't think so.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Thought that this was crass and too much- definitely not for me. I stopped reading half way as it gave me a sick feeling in my stomach. I do not really see the difference between a man watching porn and this book and so for me it creates double standards.
0802473156|5.0|I read the book and found it to be most useful in relationships with people. I was pleasantly surprised.<br />I am service oriented.. I thought it was quality of time. That did come in a close second. I now<br /> understand and am relaxing my expectations. I understand my husband\\"s language.Knowing both of<br /> ours, takes  away a lot of  stress and unfulfilled expectations. I have come  to better appreciate our<br /> relationship with out unnecessary demands. I do know that I do respond to all 5 languages.<br />There s is one I am some what uncomfortable with and now that I know what it is , I am working on<br />my responses . It will take time, but will be worth the effort. I believe this would work for everyone. I<br /> thank my Pastoral Associate for recommending the book. I highly recommend it to everyone interested<br />in having a great relationships with others.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love the app, but I think there needs to be some explaining. I get lost at times but all in all I love the App!!!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam seems to be one of those rare talents who appeals to people like me and to teens. I never imagined I would ever say this, but its true: he is as good as Roy Orbison and yes, even Bobby Hatfield. If you dont know who Bobby Hatfield is, buy yourself a greatest hits album by the Righteous Brothers and listen. When you find the song \\"Ebbtide\\", thats Bobby. Im not a devoted fan of ALL of his varied styles, but his softer side, his ballads, his vocal range, clarity (yes, you can actually understand the words - try that with a Springsteen album!), have me listening to his songs on replay. Its a testimony to the tastes of the american teen audience that he didnt win Idol, but thats another issue - neither did some others who became superstars. So what did ever happen to Clay Aiken, Ruben, etc?  Gone. Im so impressed with Adam I actually bring up his name when, on rare occasions, music comes up - which isnt so often at my age, lol.
0345803493|5.0|I have read some of the other reviews on the books and I must say I'm surprised.  Come on ladies... it is fiction - fantasy not the read world!  Of course it is unbelieve that Christian is rich, gorgeous, successful and young.  That Ana is easily orgasmic.  That they can have sex over and over.  It is a book!  A wonderful guilty pleasure of romance, love, and sex.  I loved the books.  I loved the characters.  I think the author is smart and witty.  I love how book 2 delves into why Christian is the way he is.  And I was sad when Charlie Tango went missing.  Read it and remember it is a fantasy, created to entertain.  :)
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|Great Movie! Good plot. Good effects,Worth watching.....I would recommend this one to anyone wanting some action and good visuals.Need to see this one!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Started reading this book and thought I knew where it was heading....wow, was I wrong! Enjoyed it so much I'm buying more of her books.
B001CDWFPC|4.0|I am very pleased with the ESV Bible for kindle. Let me point out what I like most: The intro for each book - which may contain themes and a concise but yet deep look into interpretation approaches as in Revelation for instance. The intros and cross-references are just what I wanted now that I've started to study the Bible eagerly.<br /><br />The timelines, maps and cross-references are great. If the maps were a little bit bigger, that would be even better but I must say I loved the resources. Other kindle study bibles are double the price and this one is just right for the job it does. As a non-native reader of English, I take a lot of advantage looking up words without having to leave the passage I am in.<br /><br />I haven't given it 5 stars because when I am reading a passage and go to the cross-reference in a second layer, I need to start again to go back to where I was.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|I use this item with [[ASIN:B003BVVYSM Sewell Direct SW-23000 PC to TV Converter]] and [[ASIN:B006LP0FXA Sewell Direct SW-29831 Sewell Hammerhead]].<br /><br />I've tried this combination on a Toshiba Satellite, Acer Aspire One and Dell Optiplex. I split the VGA signal to my flat screen tv (through the hdmi converter) and my portable dvd player (through the rca converter and inputs).<br /><br />Many other reviews have concerns of ghosting on the screens. (GHOSTING - when the signal is blurred due to two identical images overlapping each other with slight variations in position.) I have encountered this same issue but only when I change resolutions on the VGA source.<br /><br />I haven't tried the VGA splitter with any VGA cable, the splitter is connected directly to the two adapters (mentioned above) and from there I used a HDMI and RCA cable to connect to my tv and dvd player.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful to anyone looking to somewhat build a home theater system with different monitors with inputs.
B005N4F37S|5.0|We had just visited Gettysburg so thought the movie would be more meaningful to us.  It was very well done, depicted those things we had learned about on our visit and brought the people to life that we had learned about.  Recommend the movie and a visit to Gettysburg as well.
0345803485|5.0|Bottom line -  this book as well as the other two in the trilogy is sensual.  There is a lot of carnal activity but it has more substance then just that.  BUT if you are bothered by detailed accounts of lustful activity or have an aversion to not so vanilla bed room antics then I don't recommend this book.  However, if you are curious then read the book.  It lives up to the hype.  The author is smart and witty.  She is so descriptive in the main characters that you find yourself really rooting for them.  The one thing that I was not really anticipating was the humor.  This book is funny.  The two main characters email back and forth and their banter is hilarious, sassy, and flirtatious.  Dominant man, submissive woman????  Hmmm, I think Ana might have the real power but she is SO shy and innocent.  The end of the book was sad but it compelled me to immediately read book 2.  Oh and lastly, that silver grey silk woven tie on the cover has special meaning and is discussed at length. ;)
B007Q476KU|5.0|This was a really great movie to watch! Impressive to say the very least! A must see if you like action ,a good story,and great producing.I really felt for this horse and his owner.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Fantastic app! The best feature is the navigation. Smartly done, it feels natural, not clumsy like so many others. I'm using it more and more.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|I can not even begin to describe the brilliance of this remake. It took an already great anime, and then shaped it into a perfect version. Gotta say that this movie made Evangelion shoot up to my favorite. I'm usually not a fan of remakes but this is just so dramatically better. My mouth was hanging open by the end and I await the third movie with extreme impatience.
B009329Y30|3.0|It was okay. Truthfully, I hadn't had high hopes for it, but I'm a Zac Efron fan and thought I'd check it out. It was good enough to watch but I probably won't buy it and watch it again and again.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|What can I say?  It is so hard to believe Rodriquez just faded away in the United States<br /><br />He has made somewhat of a come back,finally.  I am very happy for him.  It is about time.<br /><br />His music just reaches out and touches you.<br /><br />grannysue
B0083SBMBM|2.0|Why does the blue ray versions have the special features and deleted scenes? For the $20 for just the dvd version that has absolutely nothing else that comes with it, it is a complete rip-off. For $4 more i could get both versions with stuff included. What the heck Marvel and your partners.....
B004XANKVO|1.0|Honestly expected a lot more from Thule after spending over a $100 on this item. I'll give that the product is made from high-quality material and it can be seen right out of the box. However, not all places that needed this high-quality GOT the attention. The strap for instance, the biggest design concern for any backpack maker should be to make it extremely comfortable for customer carrying a fair amount of weight. The straps dig into your skin. Very uncomfortable and does not disperse the weight properly. Second, the sun-glass holder is designed very awkwardly that the front of bag doesn't sit up right but sags (UNATTRACTIVE). Overall, I'm returning the backpack and hoping that next time THULE comes up with something better for the money. Going Northface now.
B00884GR0W|2.0|I still prefer actual Minecraft over this, though. For me, this app sometimes stops responding, and if I had some precious hard-to-find stuff that the game hasn't saved, ITS GONE. Amazon has Minecraft now. Go buy it, people.
B00297FEUI|5.0|This is a continuation of great music from the first Transformers score.  It uses alot of the original music and blends Linkin Parks New Divide into the score.  Such great music to listen to to take your mind off todays troubles.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This album is really special.  So, glad he was finally re-discovered.<br /><br />Saw him on the David Letterman show, and he was wonderful.  Everyone should go see \\"Searching for Sugarman\\".<br /><br />Very inspiring story.<br /><br />grannysue
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a great game to play to waste time. It would be nice if there were a way to see how much buildings and things cost though. Never know how many more coins I need in order to build.
0060245867|5.0|One of the best Children's books.  I have read this many times to groups of 3-5 year olds.  They love it.  I like it so much I purchased it for my grandchildren who also love the story.  Check out Laura Numeroff's other books - they are small people pleasers as well!
B0058YPGL6|5.0|The storylines, dialogue and characters are well-written. The show is well carried by the young cast.  Great show, good buy.
1401937268|5.0|Wonderful and highly accurate deck with such great energy. This is my best deck yet. I love it and can't stop using it on my friends and clients!
B00992CF6W|5.0|great version and you can add textures. I have sphax 128x on it and very little lag. Worth the money!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|One of the best FX continuing series I have seen.  Definitely one of the most reality fictional shows that will not only keep you on the edge of your seat but the script and acting is REALLY well done.  An addictive series that I won't want to end.  Very entertaining!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|really liked the movie.reminded me of the original series. great action. liked the characters. tom cruise - lookin good!! i definately recommend ghost protocol.amazon ships stuff so quickly.
1609611543|5.0|I've been reading lots about statin drugs, mainly Lipitor and have finally found a book that is written by a doctor that tells how bad these drugs are. I've talked with people who have tried Lipitor, but in a short time they ache all over. They decided against their doctor's orders and have stopped taking this statin...they feel so much better. This book \\"Wheat Belly\\" has given me much food for thought. I hate taking pills, the side effects can be very bad, this book is helping me to make a different approach to taking care of my own body.
B006T3RM08|5.0|I purchased this item at the recommendation of the Apple store rep and it makes ALL of the difference when using our new Mac Mini as the media room controller.  It was quite cumbersome using the keyboard and trackpad separately.  Looking for other accessories to bring the two together yielded a list of huge awkward-looking items.<br /><br />The Clique turned out to be the smart and clever answer to our needs.  The drawings on the box provide all the instruction needed and we were up in running in about two minutes.  I just cannot say enough good things about how the good design of this item.
0525953728|5.0|first of all great book, my hats off to the brave man who lived the life and thank you for everything you have done<br /><br />Ive read the book...twice....<br /><br /> \\"what a disgrace\\",\\"blue falcon alert\\" bla bla bla are mislead and uneducated people....In no way has this man compromised future operations, nothing in the book is a secret, the people claiming so are people who obviously are new to the subject in general. Everything contained in the reading material is easily available online. These people are probably very miserable people and are better \\"keyboard warriors\\" than anything else in life<br /><br />In my opinion, i am a tax paying hard working honest veteran for whatever its worth these days, this is a good read for those people like myself that are fascinated by our special operations.<br /><br />If anyone wants to criticize the book, you must first criticize the president, because he is the one who made the decision to take this public in the first place. Love it or hate it, it is what it is, stop complaining and be appreciative of your alive
B008XG1X18|4.0|Not bad at all for a mobil app. Works good on our Kindle Fire. I use it all the time.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Brian,(Buy Mart) Thanks for taking notice of my recent feedback 9/14/12 regarding season 4 disk 3 you have come through making good on your commitment of customer satisfaction. I will be ordering from you again soon. Thanks, Ray
B001IF5YLQ|4.0|It does what it says. I connected my Mac Book Pro to an external Apple cinema 27\\" display. Works well. Fast shipping.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is a great take on the canon-style game with colorful graphics, smooth animation, and a wonderful interface.<br /><br />I did see instances, as others reported, where platforms which should have fallen remained with nothing under them, but replaying the level was no big deal and on I went.<br /><br />Five stars because of the game itself and because I kept wanting to play it again and again.
1451608659|5.0|I am a former elite gymnast and I was very hesitant to read this book because of how the media had skewed Dominique Moceanu (DM) image.  The bratty, confident gymnast who grew up to be outspoken about how awful gymnastics is.  Well, I didn't believe that fully of course but after reading this book I have a different type of respect for her.  Her life is incredible and it is so amazing to me that she turned out to be such a normal young lady with a beautiful family.  I was especially intrigued with how she told the story about Bela and Martha.  I am ashamed now to know that Martha is now the face fo USA Gymnastics.  Like she said, the way things are run is un-American and more people need to speak up.  She is so courageous to write this Memoir but I am so happy that she did.  After everything that has happened I hope that she continues to have a blessed and beautiful life with her family.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I've had this headset for a few weeks now and am really loving it.  It's very comfortable and the sound is great.<br /><br />My only complaint is with the USB cord reel thingy.  It's bulky, it's awkward to use and it creates a cluttered mess on the desk.  It seems like a strange thing to supply with a cleanly designed wireless headset designed to work without the nuisance of wires.<br /><br />Anyway, I now charge the headset with a simple six foot USB cable ordered here on Amazon and I plug the headset reciever into a USB port on the front of my computer. It works perfectly.<br /><br />Cable can be ordered here:  [[ASIN:B004GF8TIK Mediabridge - USB 2.0 A-Male to Micro-B Cable (6 Feet)]]<br /><br />--Update 3/4/2014--<br />The headset is still working perfectly.  I do a lot of gaming and listening to music so this thing gets a good workout. I do take care of it (treat it with reasonable care and hang it on a hook when not in use).  It's holding up well and still looks and works just like new.  Highly recommended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Of all 3 books the third one was the best. I loved it. I really hope she writes a fourth one.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|this is the BEST way to watch youtube on you kindle fire and the best part you can download videos u like!
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app works well most of the time. When I go back to the all it usually doesn't respond and I have to force quit, but it always works after I open it again.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Just purchased this back pack because I got a 17 inch laptop. Already had an indentical one only smaller & absolutely love them. There is a pocket for everything. My first one has been fron one coast to the other and still looks brand new.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|Being an M. Night fan since The Sixth Sense, I have been increasingly disappointed with his more recent entertainment attempts.  However, Devil is a step in the right direction.  The suspense builds all the way to the climax of this movie.  The way everything tied together in the end and the nice little twist worked for me.  Loved this movie.
1250000971|3.0|While I didn't think this was Archer's best work, it was still pretty entertaining until the last 30 or so pages where they are deliberating who should get the \\"title\\".  While his books are good with character and plot development, the endings are not as satisfying as they could be.
1451696191|5.0|The protagonist is one of the most memorable and likeable characters I've encountered in ages.  This book spoke to my heart.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is one of the most romantic books I have read in a while. I must say, It's a Winner!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love it its awesome . great graphics coudent be better!  endless fun so glad I downloaded it I haven't found anything bad :D
B008IJTFYW|5.0|perfect, and really helps you either relax or fall asleep.<br />I love it and would recommend it to any and everyone.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Season 2 of The Walking Dead is even more intense than Season 1.  The characters become more fully realized as their situation becomes more desperate.  The acting and the script are top notch, and the fact that the viewer has no idea when a Walker will show up turns the tension up to the point of being agonizing.  The final scene of the episide Pretty Much Dead Already is the best one of both seasons, and the deaths of two of the main characters comes out of nowhere.  The final episode finds the group in worse shape than they've ever been as they unknowingly face another turning point in their lives.<br /><br />There's a great special feature with Robert Kirkman, the creator of the original graphic series on which the show is based.  The webisodes are a bit lame, but overall, this is even more of a must buy than the first season.  The Walking Dead is the scariest show ever made for TV, no exceptions.
B000244FDW|5.0|While there is much to praise in the more recent A&E version of 'Pride and Prejudice', this earlier filming with Elizabeth Garvey and David Rintoul has always seemed to us to be the best dramatization of the story. It is far truer to the book and the period than the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle series: Fay Weldon's script is almost unadulterated Austen, with very few alterations (apart from necessary cuts of course) or additions. Elizabeth Garvey is, for me, the quintessential Lizzie, with a fine voice and bearing, a delightfully satirical eye, and an ability to convey deep feeling with little more than the raising of an eyebrow or a tightening of the lips. David Rintoul makes Lizzie's detestation of Darcey early on perfectly understandable, and then allows the character to warm and to win not only Lizzie but the audience as well. The sisters are all excellent, and Mr and Mrs Bennett (Moray Watson and Priscilla Morgan) are superb. Judy Parfitt as Lady Catherine is peerless, and in fact there is no cause for any objection from even the most resolute Austenian. I recommend this version as the definitive one.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This movie is hilarious and it is definitely a must see! It will definitely take you back to the late eighties/early nineties!
B0042ESTQW|5.0|Short and simple - this case fits perfect and it well thought out.  You have good access to the USB port.  Adds a good feel to the unprotected plastic case.
B008XG1X18|2.0|the latest version is terrible. When you click on the app, 90% of the time, it force closes and says the app is not working. incredibly annoying.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Love it.
B007SGM084|2.0|I was dissapointed with the details of the characters.  It is taking too long to find out why Christian Grey is the way he is.  The lead female anastasia is really boring.  The book keeps repeating the same sentences and descriptions over and over again.  There is no debth or breath in this series.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Although the subject matter would seem to be such that adults would most likely be interested, my grandchildren (9 and 14) were fascinated.  It gave them a bit of history wrapped up in a human interest story that had impact.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I honestly don't see why everyone is complaining, I have had no issues so far on my kindle fire!<br /><br />There was a time I believe, that I wasn't able to create boards, which was a bit annoying, but that's all fixed now. I think they fixed pretty much everything in the update.<br /><br />So, cool app, I LOVE pinterest, use it all the time, and I hope it continues to spark the interests of more and more people! &lt;3
B00992CF6W|5.0|before on my Hp i had minecraft, and a few days a go I saw this and I was like &quot;I have to get this.&quot; minecraft is a great game it has so many fun things to do. BUY IT NOW. WORKS GREAT ON KINDLE FIRE (BY AMAZON)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So I was very excited when I bought this book for my Kindle this morning. As I am reading I am thinking to myself, oh this has to get better, it is a best seller. I keep reading, even though my brain is begging me to stop, my IQ is dropping by the nanosecond and every time I read \\"He is freaking hot\\" all I can think about are my kids saying the exact same words, and they are under the age of 13. I make it 25% of the way through the book, supposedly I am getting to the good parts, then for two paragraphs they have worse sex than I have ever had in my life. My \\"hard limit\\" list is the same as this supposed dominate male and I am a mother in my late 30's. My children have larger vocabularies than the writer does, and since the writer talks like my children that's all I can think about the whole time I am reading. If this is \\"Mommy Porn\\" mommy's other than me must have a really dull, bland, rather moronic sex life. What a waste of time and money. I would rather shove a steak knife in my eye socket than read another page of this utter drivel. The only good thing about ANYTHING was that I wasn't suckered in to buying all three books at once!
B002VECM6S|5.0|Every time we watch this video, we see things we missed:  great lines, great interplay of characters . .  .  .  Sandra Bullock is excellent.  Her facial expressions are worth hundreds of words, and the interactions between cast members is classic. In addition, the movie is though-provoking. Every viewer can learn much about human nature from the interplay of the family as they are adding a new member. Every teacher should be required to watch it over and over and realize that only one of the teachers in an excellent private school is willing to look behind the surface and see the child and teach him.  It gives me pause to think about students in less fortunate settings.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The book is an intense triller that keeps you guessing.  Balducci stays true to all his hero's with an all American hero who puts right above all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|at first I though that 6.99 for a game was a little bit out of hand... but its completely worth it I'm in love with minecraft trust me u wont regret getting it
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is great. I'm totally addicted to pinterest. This app is great to use when you don't wanna use a computer or anything. Its great.
0525953728|5.0|I am now mid point in the book, No Easy Day.<br /><br />It has been helpful to read in order to realize what those men went through.<br /><br />I am thankful for the people that serve our nation in the Military.
B002QXI2M2|3.0|Generally excellent.  Performed with great dignity.  I found the overstuffed chairs ludicrous but they're scarcely visible.  The dancers in the metal shop aprons were acceptable.  But  for me the jocks wandering around in white shorts distroyed the tone of the piece.  Eurydike was dressed in a very red red.
B008YI91HS|5.0|Best movie that was made about dinosaurs and one of the greats of all time. Youa ll know that though!!!!!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I thought this was the best Snow White movie I have ever seen, a lot of action and the story line was good too even though I have seen many renditions of the story. Very entertaining and the acting was well done. I would watch thia again and I don't watch to many movies more than once.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I almost didn't order this book after reading the reviews.  Hey, it's just another Reacher novel.  Maybe not quite as good as his best, but we aren't talking filet mignon here.  This is like Tex-Mex.  Never great, rarely bad and usually pretty much tastes the same.  It was a fun read and certainly delivered a few hours of diversion.<br /><br />I will say that Lee Child's knowledge of U.S. geography is as bad as one would expect for a Brit.  Still, don't they have editors for this kind of thing?  I guess most of those people are from one of the coasts and couldn't pick out Nebraska or Kansas on a map.  His attempt to overcome this deficit appears to be the result of an internet search.  We get meaningless information like gallons of water in the aquifer, area codes and population figures.<br /><br />Nothing to do with the book, but I have to comment on the Tom Cruise debacle.  Obviously, for many protagonists, physical characteristics are not that important.  But his size is a key part of Reacher's character.  I'm glad that Cruise likes the series and the character.  However, that's not good enough reason to let him ruin the character.  Woody Allen may like Superman, but that ain't gonna fly either.<br /><br />I'm going on a record declaring that all loyal fans of Reacher should boycott the movie if they persist in using the midget.  Who's with me?
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|Distant Suns is a very long running astronomy app that was originally published for the Amiga series of computers, and it's the best astronomy app I've found so far for Android.<br /><br />While it's listed for only Nook and Kindle Fire, I've been running it on a Nexus 7 for a few days and it works flawlessly for me.  No crashes or odd behavior.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|I love how this book shows who Justin trully is. I love how it gives more details about how everything heppened. Fame wasnt given to him, an oppurtunity was and he took advantege of it, he worked hard to be where he is now. He is hated by people who he havent even meet, people who know nothing about him. By the end of this book you may not LOVE him but you will have RESPECT for him. if you`ve seen never say never and or read this book you would know that life hasnt been easy for him. Justin just want to make a positve change in world, making music, by  inspiring others, by giving not only his money but time to charity. Yes he is now rich and famous but still humble, he appriciates everything we do for him he trully cares. He`s accomplished so much... But hes Just Getting Started... Your a Belieber? You have respect for him? Have any questions? Follow me at @Inspired_By_JDB
0385344333|2.0|Lee Child has always said he doesn't outline his books in advance and until now I didn't believe him.  The stories hung together too well.  This time I believe him.  The first part of the book is excellent - the hitchhiking, the people who pick Reacher up, his intelligence at noticing the discrepancies that make him suspect all is not as it seems - vintage.  Similarly the intercutting with the mystery of the killing of an unknown man nearby.  Then it falls apart.  I don't quite understand the ending.  I don't really know who did what, to whom, or why.  It seems either to have little connection to the first half, or it so clever that I can't follow it.  In sum, I think this is a lazy book.  It has all the shtick, and tricks and very little of the thinking that makes me want to read more.  Also, a small point, I think his research is showing.  The descriptions and historical details of Kansas are too naked, too isolated from anything in the story.

0393061310|4.0|Did you ever wonder if there is a certain inevitability in the way world history has evolved? Jared Diamond argues, in effect, that the giant Eurasian continent (Europe and Asia combined) was predestined to take over the world. Everything conspired in its favor: climate, vegetation, population distribution, mineral resources and even bacteria. Compare Eurasia and Australia, for example, and you find that when humans evolved to the point of beginning agriculture, Eurasia had dozens of varieties of natural grains that could feed humans and a dozen potential draft and food animals. Australia had only two puny proto-grains and no potential draft animals. No contest. Eurasia developed settled agriculture, food surpluses, dense populations, cities and complex social organizations. Due to climate and landform zones, Eurasian civilizations were then able to share inventions and culture with each other by trade or conquest, whereas complex civilizations that developed elsewhere, such as those of the Aztecs and Incas, remained relatively isolated. Even the types of germs conspired to \\"favor\\" European and Asian expansion. The virulent types of bacteria that developed among dense human populations in interaction with animal populations wiped out low-density indigenous societies on other continents when Europeans explored and settled new lands. On the other hand, non-Eurasian germs brought back from Africa and the New World had little impact in Eurasia. Even if you don't agree with the hypothesis, Diamond has given us a fact-crammed, yet very readable book that won a Pulitzer Prize.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Where did the Jack Reacher we knew go? This is a travesty on the people who pre-ordered. It's just boring, and there is no action, and it's boring, and there is no action, and it's boring, and.......<br /><br />And, Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher in the movie. Are you kidding????
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is a ton of fun and very well done. The characters and goals are easy to understand and fun to work through.

B007FG9LIE|3.0|Hard to write an honest review without spoilers. So this is not an entirely honest review.<br /><br />In \\"Pines\\" author Crouch masterfully ratchets up stratospheric levels of intrigue. He creates a conundrum that is thick, meaning you the reader can only guess what's going on while suspecting you're wrong, and you probably are, but broad issues with the storytelling begin to unravel the novel's strengths. The main character, a secret service guy named Ethan, runs around in circles so much of the time, without any plan or displayed skill sets, that eventually his plight gets stale. This leads the oomph, wow and tension factors to fizzle at around the half-way mark.<br /><br />With my interest faltering I began paying more attention to the author's infatuation with fractured sentences and muddied tense structure and syntax--things that definitely did not help the fluidity of the read.  About two thirds in the mystery adopts some horror story elements, sequences with Edgar Alan Poe-ish 4-legged type monsters. While these incongruent action sequences helped to dispel any notion I might have had about where this novel was headed, other readers might be glad to know that there's a very sane reason for these creatures' existence lurking in the book's conclusion. Ooops, did I just say a very sane reason? Well, actually there is nothing sane about the conclusion, even though a lot of readers seem awed by it.<br /><br />Overall, an average read. Has some very exciting and interesting moments in the early going. While you probably won't guess the ending, it's not necessarily a good thing, especially if you come to the conclusion that  author's 2 plus 2 does not equal 4.
B000E9910W|4.0|This is a fine collection of songs for those, like myself, who, while not big Doobie fans, and who, like myself do not want to buy all their CDs.  Some reviewers complain that these songs are radio edits of longer material.  But this goes unnoticed by those who know the Bros only from the radio and like what they heard blasting from their FMs while driving down the highways or walking the boardwalk on salty summer afternoons.  I would think that those who complain would already own the individual CDs.  The music included here is great, including songs I had forgotten over the years.  If you are someone who enjoys this music but not enough to purchase pricey boxed sets or to buy each album (with I am sure some boring material - they weren't known for being an \\"album\\" group - that is to say you won't find any of their CDs on any critic's list of great albums).  The sound is excellent as well.
B008E374PO|5.0|This was a great, light pop album with toe tapping songs that will keep you coming back for more. As I have heard some of Owl City's music before on the radio, I was looking forward to hearing the new album. While it is different than some of the past songs I have heard, it shows versatility and has some great mixes. I also enjoyed the fact that you also get to hear some other well known artists in the songs, so you get the best of many fronts. Some would say that this is a great album for the summer, as it is light and boisterous, but I would have to say that I would listen to this no matter what time the year. A great CD!

B0034G4OVS|3.0|This film is basically a mountain version of \\"Open water\\", definitely not as good but certainly original, a litle bit slow in some parts but quite surprising in others and even genuinely scary in a scene or two.<br /><br />The story begins with two young guys and a young girl who took a weekend to go skiing. Because of a snafu (and also because of their own reckless stupidity) they find themselves blocked on a chairlift, high above the ground, alone in the middle of the night, with the perspective of spending the whole week there, before people come open the ski resort for the next weekend...<br /><br />The story seems to be quite silly, but it is not half bad filmed and with the panicked - and not very clever - three people making some critical mistakes, their situation will become very dire indeed... The coming of a blizzard complicates things even more and gives to this film some pretty good moments. At one moment, the deteriorating condition of the girl, Parker (Emily Blunt), will force the two guys, Joe and Dan, best friends since preschool, into some pretty desperate moves - and it is indeed a tough thing for a man to seat still when the chilly wind rips slowly but certainly pieces of skin from the face of an attractive young female next to him... This kind of primal reaction explains a lot of heroically stupid things happening in \\"Frozen\\"...<br /><br />Now this is definitely not a great or a very good film and without much effort it is easy to find lots of plot holes, but with a beer or two (and also at least one cup of hot chocolate) it is quite watchable. There were many critics about the ending, but I personally found it rather good.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a rather honest little thriller, to see once and then sell on E-Bay. Can be good for watching with your girlfriend as it will probably induce her into cuddling in search of some warmth (this film REALLY can make you feel cold)...cuddling in search of some warmth (this film REALLY can make you feel cold)...
B0063IH60K|3.0|great game! there are ads at the start of each game. that's really the only down side. its free, and you can choose to skip the ad.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|I loved it! I'm a fan of vampire movies and tv shows and this movie is now one of my new favorites. Colin Farrell was execellent as a vampire. A btter vampire than Robert Pattinson. Anton Yelchin was so cute in this and tough as a vampire hunter in training. David Tennant was really amazing as Peter Vincent. My sister and where fsngirling when he came on, those parts where really funny. I would recomment this movie to anyone who love vampire movies to buy it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this series.  I felt that the second book was the best of the three.  I read it in under a week in between a very busy schedule.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|This movie was really good and after you bought it you can watch the movie right after you buy it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|new and interesting. definitely makes you think. a fun time waster. it could use clear instructions at the beginning. I didn't realize that the connection pipes needed to fill the whole game board. but it corrected me and then I was good.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|I usually devour any Reacher book as soon as I get it. But with this one, I just could not wait until it ended. I almost stopped reading it 75% of the way through (maybe sooner).<br /><br />By far, the worst book of the series. One star for trying.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Was not sure about these books until I saw the movie and then ran through all three books in two days. The second one is a catch you up to date between the first and last but brings it all together for the final book.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I already watched through the entire first season and it left me extremely impressed.  I had never seen the show prior to this and was glad I picked this up.  The storyline, acting, effects, etc. are all very good.  It left me wanting more (just ordered the second season).  This is a show that can be appreciated by all, whether they like zombie shows/movies or not.  The zombie presence is there, but the focus on the story and the group's struggle to survive is what makes this a riveting show.  You will not be disappointed.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Thoroughly enjoy this show! Characters are very interesting, and class differences are breaking down somewhat with younger generation. Using instant streaming with no problems at all.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! It has so many great ideas. My son and I have done crafts and have made his favorite meals! You wont regret downloading this app!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm no expert, but I thought the story was really boring. I wanted to read it to see what all the hype is about, and yet again I am surprised at what makes the top in the New York Times. I also think that the relationship between the two is just awful- not because of the sex but because of both of their personalities.
B004EBT7RI|5.0|Excellent, so discriptive it was as though I was there eating and smelling all the dishes and joining in the celebrations. The story was so realistic I thought it was a biography.
B00479SVBU|5.0|best invention since the toaster, i would never be without one. this product beats a cd player, hands down. I wholeheartedly endorse this product
B003IPC5UC|5.0|This album is just amazing<br />all of the songs have their own soul and at the same time they all have the same core...<br />all of them good and with a good chance of being a single, and the edition it's just amazing, the sticker with the code, the photographs, the DVD and the online content it's just perfect, all of the CD's should be like this to raise up the music industry
141694737X|5.0|My little guy is just over a year old and he loves this book.  The flaps on the different pages keeps him interested all the way to the end.  In fact after we are done reading the book, he takes it and flips the pages and lifts the flaps!! Very cute!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|No need to rehash all of the reviews of the show itself, this is to rate the packaging for the limited edition set. McFarlane hit this one out of the park, quality, attention to detail etc, all beyond the price paid. The detail in the sculpture itself is worth the price alone WITHOUT the Blue-Ray discs. This is a collectible grade set, if you are inclined to keep it in mint condition. Perfect execution and quality manufacturing are evident and I would not expect less from the reputation McFarlane has earned with the Spawn collections that span many years. This will not dissapoint anyone who  wants a great collectors item in the Zombie genre.
0345803507|4.0|Well...it's over.  And like the rest of the women in the world who completed this book, we are left wanting more.  Amazing writing, transporting us out of our lives and into a dream.  I miss Christian everyday...
B008602KQI|5.0|Of course the book is always better, but as a film, this was very well done. Excellent casting, good exposition and overall storytelling. I've watched it several times since purchasing! :)
B003F17ZN6|1.0|was not the actually DVD very dissappointed. wish i would have known that i wasnt going to get the right DVD before spending the money on it.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|No book has inspired more people to take up running than this book.<br /><br />I bought this on a recommendation from a friend and read it in one sitting. I simply couldn't put it down. I was just starting to play with the idea of starting to run at the time. This book made me realize I could run if I wanted to and that long distance running one of the gifts most humans are born with.<br /><br />At the time of reading this book, I had done two runs of one mile each, but that was my limit. After reading this, I signed up for my first marathon. 8 months later, I am a runner and a marathon finisher. I highly doubt I would have changed my life so much for the better without it.<br /><br />Almost every runner I talk with has read this book. Stop whatever you're doing and get it right now. It'll change your life.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|Can not put this book down. The insight and depth the authors go into make the book a fantastic trip into the roles and relationships shared and undertaken by the few men who have had the position in the highest office in world politics.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|A lot of life lessons have come for me out of this book. It is a great picture of Steve Jobs: the man. I'm not a fanboi by any stretch of the imagination, but few can argue with the impact he made on our daily lives. This book is like the \\"behind the scenes\\" or \\"the making of\\" extras for a movie. Well worth reading and understanding that, great as his impact was, he was just an ordinary, flawed human being like the rest of us. It will leave you looking for ways you can make a difference to the people's lives around you.

0393088774|5.0|Paul Krugman, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2008, has one of the clearest and most succinct proposals for fixing the ailing US and world economies that I've ever seen: Do what works and stop doing what doesn't.  That's a nutshell wrapup of Krugman's main advice: use Keynesian economic policies and drop calls for greater austerity.<br /><br />Keynesianism worked well during the Great Depression, World War II, and for nearly 40 years after that, but beginning around 1980 the economic world began to turn away from the idea that the government could or should manage the economy.  That more hands off approach dominated, despite plenty of evidence that it didn't work every well, right up until the financial crisis of 2008.  In response to the meltdowns that fall some governments, like the US, began to practice a limited form of Keynesianism that Krugman characterizes as too little and too late, while other nations like the UK opted for austerity measures that actually made things worse.<br /><br />Krugman analyzes what went wrong and what continues to go wrong, and tells us how to get out of the mess we're in.  His advice isn't particularly surprising or radical: build infrastructure, do more to help underwater homeowners, invest in job creation, etc. He points out, with the same sort of withering scorn that is familiar to faithful readers of his column, the dangers of austerity programs like the one proposed by various GOP politicians and Tea Partiers and gives faint praise (being sure to point out their failure to go far enough) to efforts by the Obama Administration.<br /><br />Krugman writes clearly with a good eye for a telling anecdote.  It is to be hoped that after November the reelected Obama Administration, with more support from Congress, will listen to him and not the prophets of austerity who have prolonged our economic woes.

0425263908|4.0|I read this book after reading the 50 Shades books and felt it was a little bit of a \\"knock off.\\" But overall, I did get really into the story and am excited for the next book to come out.  It was really good- entertaining and I really enjoyed it.
B007RI56NY|4.0|Train has done it again. Another great album that I enjoy listening to!<br />The album has been added to my favorite playlist..<br />Kudos to Train - they never disappoint.
B002ZG99NG|1.0|This review applies just to the two disc blue ray extended cut version and I can sum it up in two words - \\"DON'T BOTHER\\".  Don't get me wrong, \\"The Town\\" is a great movie even though it softens the character of Doug Macrae AND lets him live at the end.  Also, it eliminates the relationship with the FBI agent and adds some sex.  Still a great gangster movie.  Ben Affleck had the same problem with \\"Gone Baby Gone\\".  Anyone who read the book knows that Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan were totally wrong as Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro but still it was a fine movie.  The problem with the extended version of \\"The Town\\" is that the added scenes were added haphazardly and didn't always make sense.  There was one or two scenes that added a little nuance but was not really worth it.  Not like the extended versions of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" movies which really added to the theatrical releases.  My guess is that Ben Affleck didn't have anything to do with the extended versions because he seem more professional than that.<br /><br />The other reason I bought the extended version was that I had read somewhere that a version of the movie had been done with a different ending and I was hoping that it was more in keeping with the book.  Unfortunately, the purchase did not fulfill the desire.  So don't bother with the extended version, especially if you already have the regular one.  It is not worth it.<br /><br />Though I rated this with \\"one star\\" for the above reason, the movie is actually at least \\"four stars\\" leaning very heavily into \\"five stars\\".
B003VIWO9I|5.0|Terry Pratchett's \\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\" is the 4th and best of his Tiffany Aching books ([[ASIN:B000R33QWY The Wee Free Men (Discworld)]], [[ASIN:B000R4LGMA A Hat Full of Sky (Discworld: Young Adult)]], [[ASIN:B000JMKTE6 Wintersmith (Discworld)]], and now [[ASIN:B003VIWO9I I Shall Wear Midnight (Discworld)]]).  Like all the other books, even though they're labeled \\"Young Adult,\\" they're really not:  they're eminently suitable for all ages.  Unlike the other Tiffany Aching books, and the reason I consider this book the best of the series, this book is more plot-driven than Tiffany-learns driven.  Along with that greater emphasis on plot comes another benefit:  a better, more meaningful and more satisfying ending.  I do have two minor quibbles with the book.  First, Pratchett has Tiffany produce and work with a shamble.  Yet, in previous books, Tiffany, like Granny Weatherwax cannot make or use a shamble (both she and Granny are such powerful witches that the shamble gets in the way).  The other issue is that Roland seems to behave as though the events in the previous book (Wintersmith), didn't happen.  His behavior and knowledge seem to be frozen at the point in the first book where he's been kidnapped by the fairy queen.  I was considering dropping my rating a star because of those inconsistencies, but realized that they're just too minor to do that.  So, I'm happy to rate this book at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.
0345803485|5.0|Hands down, best book ever!  These books take us out of our lives and truely into a world few ever knew of.<br />WOW!  I loved every minute I spent with my nose in these pages.  I don't think anyone will ever create such a story<br />that completely surpasses any other books I know of.  Great job EL!!
034580404X|5.0|Couldn't put the books down after I got over my initial shock of the erotic sex.  They were easy to read and I got caught up in Ana's struggle to rescue Christian from his past.  It made me reflect on a few long ago relationships that might have ended differently had I some of Ana's tenacity and love.  Very good, entertaining read!  Even my 81 year old aunt enjoyed them!
B007XF0X16|2.0|First let me say that I am rarely one to complain about an old movie, even a classic movie, getting a modern day makeover. I see negative reviews of remakes based alone on the feeling that some movies are sacred and should never be messed with. I say if you can take a classic and make it even better, then by all means have at it. The 2010 version of [[ASIN:B002ZG9788 Clash of the Titans]] failed at making the 1981 version better and the 2012 Wrath sequel didn't come close to redeeming the 2010 debacle.<br /><br />I was actually encouraged when I saw that [[ASIN:B004ULEEY8 Battle: Los Angeles]] Director Jonathan Liebesman took the reins from Clash Director Louis Leterrier, because I thought that Battle: LA was quite well done. But Liebesman stayed the course of a CGI spectacle with Wrath and abandoned any effort to make you think you were seeing anything that could have actually happened in Greek Mythology or any fantasy world; the death defying action in Wrath was completely unrealistic and the acting bordered on some of the worst that I have seen in the past year.<br /><br />The story flow was a bit better in Wrath than it was in Clash, but again, not so much so that the end product was anything more than a below average screenplay. The concept was simple enough: Zeus (Liam Neeson) has been taken prisoner and Perseus (Sam Worthington) has to get him out of the Underworld and out of the clutches of Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Ares who want to sacrifice Zeus as a means to release the ancient Titans on Earth.<br /><br />Then there was the acting, or should I say lack thereof. It didn't seem to me that Worthington or Neeson took their roles seriously at all. They came across as two A-listers making cameos versus lead actors giving A-list performances. This combined with some super-unrealistic, death defying (even for a God) battle scenes really took a lot out of the movie for me.<br /><br />I was never even a fan of Greek Mythology until seeing the original Clash back in the 80s. After that movie I not only became interested in Greek Mythology, I felt I now actually knew something about it...like I just had a very clear and concise lesson in it. After the 2010 and 2012 Titans attempts, I felt the same way I did after the recent [[ASIN:B000NTPDT6 Transformers]] movies...like I'd just seen a lot of cool FX with little substance to the story.<br /><br />So my recommendation is to go back and watch the [[ASIN:B000Q7ZOL2 the 1981 original version]] and watch the updated Clash & Wrath on cable. As dated as Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion effects will look in the 1981 version, you'll walk away from it with a much more entertaining and even educating experience. And if you're just looking for some mythological fun I'd say get yourself a [[ASIN:B002I0J4VQ PlayStation 3]] and spend countless hours with the [[ASIN:B008CP6MA2 God of War Saga]].the 80s.

0142407542|4.0|My son loved it. I didn't like it as much as the first but it's still a great book. Definitely buy it.
B003UXRZIY|5.0|I read the books years ago and did not even know this series was out, which I feel is one of the reasons this show only had 2 seasons.  I believe with the proper marketing, this show would have finished the saga of the Sword of Truth. Yes, die-hard book fans might turn their noses up at it.  I was one of them but this show is sheer and pure brillance.  I am so sorry that I missed it when it was on.  With all the horrible shows on TV that seem to stay on forever, this one got 2 seasons.  The actors, though almost all were unknown to me, were perfect for the parts, and I honestly never saw so many beautiful women in one cast on ANY show.  Also, Craig Parker, who plays Darken Rahl, is the epitome of what ever villan should ever hope to be.  He is deliciosly evil.  Just action-packed, sprinkled with humor, longing, magic, and good versus evil. This show deserves to still be on the air.  It's a darn crying shame it isn't.

B00004XQ83|3.0|I shouldn't be reviewing it bcuz I bought it as a gift. The person I bought it for watched the movie and enjoyed the songs, asked me if I would get him the soundtrack. He has not complained, so I guess he is enjoying it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is hard to impress me with a mystery book.  I have read so many over the years, that it's rare for me not to figure out the killer or the ending, etc.  This book is a little slow in the beginning.  You jump between the 2 main characters, Nick and Amy.  Amy's point of view is her speaking to you through her diary.  It gets a bit annoying and neither of the characters have any true rooting value.  Then you hit the halfway point of the book, and the whole story changes.  You will be left reading the last half of the book with your jaw dropped down to the floor and shaking your head incredulously.  The first half was a steady slow burn, and the second half is a 5 alarm fire!  While I predicted quite a bit of it, it just didn't matter, because it was that good.  And the ending is definitely one that you'll either love or hate.  I absolutely LOVED it and thought that it was the perfect ending for this book.  Very Hitchcock like.  It seems to have left a window for a sequel, but really I don't think that the author should do one.  It's prefect just the way it is.  I have since been recommending it to friends and family.  I've been enjoying all the different thoughts about this book.  It would be perfect for a book club.  So far, only one person that I recommended it to didn't like the ending, but loved the rest of the story.  I believe the reason that many seem to have issues with the ending is that authors have conditioned us to think that a book has to end a very specific way.  Gillian Flynn writes with an absolute disregard to the \\"rules,\\" and tells her story her way.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I am (or was) a big Reacher fan, have read every Reacher book, but no longer.  I was able to read about half the book before i finally gave up in disgust.  It is soooo bad!  The story line is stupid, the depiction of the FBI is uninformed to the point of being childish, and the story-line was painful.  Lee Child has finally lost it.  Sell a lot of &#34;A Wanted Man&#34; cause I'll never buy another Reacher book.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|I ordered the HD \\"Hunger Games\\" video and viewed the show on my wireless ROKU.<br />When the video was downloaded it told me it could not be viewed in HD. Since there were two<br />prices HD and non-HD why was I charged for HD if I did not get it. I know it was only $1<br />but I think that is a false programing and I will not be using this service again.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I was especially impressed that my order automatically came with a downloadable version of the movie, the hunger games.  I found this to be an extremely convenient and attractive addition to my order!
B001992NW4|5.0|I have this movie on Blu-ray, and have seen it many times.  The first time I saw it was in a drive-in when I was about 15.  I cowered in my seat for two hours, and then went home and tried to sleep.  I was up sweating all night.  It had been the most terrifying movie that I had seen at that time, and it still might be the most terrifying.<br /><br />I read the book on Kindle much later, and believe it or not, I still like the movie slightly better than the book.  Hey, I gave the book four stars and hedged on a five.  The book is surely that good.  But perhaps seeing it on film first biased my opinion.  I'm sure that William Peter Blatty doesn't much mind; I believe that he adapted the screenplay as well, and he did a terrific job with both.<br /><br />Now, the acting in the film is fantastic for sure; there is almost not a single weak link.  However, I believe that the most underrated star was Lee J. Cobb, with perhaps one of the greatest acting performances ever in film.  If you watch the film multiple times, as I have, you will begin to notice some of the subtleties of his acting.  The scene where he is having tea (or coffee) in the kitchen with the Ellen Burstyn character in particular is amazing.  At any rate, I believe watching this film for Mr. Cobb's performance alone is worth the price of admission.  (Jason Miller was excellent as well, as was Max von Sydow, as was Ms. Burstyn, etc. etc.  We could run all the way down the list.)<br /><br />A lot has been made about a potential remake.  I am on the fence a bit here, since usually, remakes aren't as good the original.  Also, when something is so good, why redo it?  But how about this:  Do it in 3D (yeah, 3D is overused but it would add to this film I believe and not take away), cast Meryl Streep as the mother, Chloe Moretz as the Linda Blair character, Robert Redford perhaps as the Cobb character.  And for the Max von Sydow character?  How about Clint Eastwood.  Yeah, Clint Eastwood!  I can just hear it now:\\"You feeling lucky, Satan?  Do I have one prayer left, or am I all out?\\"  (Yes, I know that Mr. Eastwood is persona non grata at the time of this writing, but I will be a big fan of this American treasure forever.)<br /><br />Naturally, I jest a bit with the proposed dialog for the proposed remake.  But a remake might be in order IF the casting and direction was done correctly.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I was almost put off buying this book by some of the earlier reviews. Fortunately they are overly critical and A Dance with Dragons continues the excellent writing seen earlier in the series. Some complain that the story does not move fast enough, but that is part of the charm of these books, watching the characters develop. If it is too slow for you, watch it on HBO instead.
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy was excellent in every way. It shows good character analysis, excellent plot and great suspense. I have enjoyed it at least three times so far--and I intend to read it again as I go...
B008B11R1Q|3.0|Let me first say that I loved the first album - simple, yet still interesting with methodical layering of sounds that flowed together perfectly. This album has some of that, but just when you would expect the addition of one more sound/hook in these tracks to complete the tune, it never happens like it did on the first album. I respect the minimalist style as I agree things are getting intolerably busy in many cases in the indie world. There is a fine line, however, between beauty in simplicity and just uninteresting repetition. This band has a ton of potential and I hope they capitalize on what made the first album so phenomenal in the future.
1451627297|3.0|This is the only work by King I have ever read, hence this review is for this book alone and is not intended as a commentary on his entire body of work.<br /><br />First writing style.  This book is written on about a 7th grade level.  It uses lots of short, simple sentences (or nonsentences).  I think I could count the number of compound-complex sentences on one hand.  There were many, many places where a sequence of two or three simple sentences could have, with just a little effort on the writer's part, been converted into a single more pleasant sentence.  I suspect that King stuck to short, simple sentences either to create a faster pace or to appeal to a broader base of readers.  As a result, the book is a very fast read.  (I read the 800+ pages in only a few days.)<br /><br />Further, the short-and-simple writing style is rendered jarring by the too-frequent insertion of fancy words where simple ones would have done just fine.  And there is way too much needless profanity.  I know that people sometimes swear, but *that* much?  And in the late 50s and early 60s?  Given all that, here is my own example of the writing style of this book:<br /><br />  See Jane run.<br />  Run dexterously, Jane, run.<br />  F---.<br /><br />(I did you a favor and spared you the explicit expletive; this book never did.)<br /><br />The characters and plot are fun -- I loved the wonderful recreation of the time period, down to the tiny details such as what brand of cigarettes they were smoking -- but in many places not believable.  I often found myself thinking \\"Nah, that wouldn't have happened that way,\\" or \\"He wouldn't have said that.\\"  One of the main plot lines, the love affair between Jake and Sadie, was sweet but unbelievable, given that it allegedly took place in the early 60s, before the sexual revolution.  I liked Jake and Sadie, I enjoyed reading about them, but I did not believe that they were real, even in an alternate history.<br /><br />And the book, as fast as it is toread, is too long.  It contains too many irrelevant details that do not advance the story.  When I first picked up the book I thought that my favorite part would be the JFK subplot, but I often became bored when the plot switched to Oswald -- seeing him beat his wife once, twice, three times was enough.  I get it.  And there are more beatings and more attacks from more people.  The book is too violent for my taste.<br /><br />All the above being said, I found the last 300 pages to be un-put-downable.  I could not stop reading it.  I wanted to find out what happened between Jake and Sadie.  (I already had a good guess as to what would happen regarding the JFK assassination.)<br /><br />But the biggest reason I gave this book as many stars as I did was because after I was finished reading it, I could not stop thinking about it.  It disturbed me, and not because of the violence.  It disturbed me because I kept thinking of myself, in a \\"corrected\\" reality, standing alone at night on the road in front of my house, looking into the living room, seeing my children inside, and thinking, \\"I hope they had a good father.\\"<br /><br />I cannot get that thought out of my mind.<br /><br />Books that haunt you after you are finished reading them deserve, in spite of their flaws, at least a few stars.

B0029QRA1U|1.0|Okay, here's how bad the ION turntable is: you need to adjust the speed with the stylus on the record because there is so much stylus drag that it actually SLOWS DOWN THE TURNTABLE when you're playing a record. Needless to say, you will NOT be getting any accurate representation of the \\"music\\" on your records by using this turntable. Having taken one apart for a repair (yes, an almost brand new unit needs a repair already), I can tell you that this is cheaply manufactured junk. Plastic everywhere. You could find a used Technics for less money and it would be sturdier and more reliable than this junk.

B0070UFMOW|1.0|---<br /><br />Edited to add: I am now returning the E17, with no plans to obtain a replacement. Either it was:<br /><br />* Shipped with a defective battery or charging system<br />* Shipped with a discharged battery, which permanently damaged the cells<br />* Shipped with defective firmware<br /><br />Unfortunately, the E17 is now reporting \\"LOW CHARGE\\" and showing an empty battery meter after apparently taking and holding a full charge. I've been over FiiO's support section, and it's abysmal. About the only thing I could do at this point is find something small enough to fit into the absurdly tiny \\"reset\\" hole, which I see they've recommended to cure everything short of cancer. That's not good enough. If FiiO get around to hiring some competent support whose first language is English, maybe later. Until then...<br /><br />---<br /><br />Note: I'm using this purely for the USB DAC functionality. No testing whatever of headphone amp capability at this time, nor extras like the TOSLINK connectivity.<br /><br />Audio seems clean and clear when tested with Sennheiser HD485 studio phones. (Discontinued.) The E17 defaults to 48KHz / 16b, which is fine, since that's about the limit of human aural perceptivity. When I have the time, I'll see if I can find the arcane ALSA(?) commands probably necessary to adjust the USB DAC for 24b PCM and so forth, and update if it doesn't work. (I'm using the E17 under Ubuntu Linux 12.04 LTS at this time. Windows and Mac users should have an easier time of it, from reading other reviews.)<br /><br />The E17 was shipped with apparently zero effective charge, which is a great way to destroy battery life. Someone may want to let FiiO know 40% is closer to a good shelf charge to keep the battery in shape before someone uses it. Unfortunately, like so many other small USB devices, the E17 cannot be powered via USB. It drains the battery at all times, depending on a steady flow of power from USB (if it's present) to charge the battery as it'sdrained.<br /><br />The E17 takes a long time (8hrs?) to charge from zero off a standard USB port. Consider investing in a more powerful charger, such as the 1-amp Samsung USB cell phone chargers.<br /><br />Final battery note: the E17 appears to drain a considerable amount of power when \\"off\\". If left unused for about 24hrs and plugged back into a USB port, it charges again for something between 30 and 60 minutes. I question how quickly these unnecessary charge/discharge cycles are going to kill off the battery.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|wow, this book really touched my heart. You pick up the book, and through the first 2 chapters, you wonder why you are reading it.  But when they hit the arena, the action starts. And you will cry in ths book. I highly reccomend it.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I must admit, I am very much impressed with this product. The look and the finish of this product is top notch. I chose this over a full size keyboard (cost me $15 extra) and I am pretty sure that I made the right decision. G13 is portable and is very comfortable. The keys are well placed (except for the ones that fall under your palm, which you can configure for lesser usable in game functions) and the curve is really comfortable. However, the placement of the Joystick doesn't make any sense to me and strictly makes it a tool to be used by the left hand.<br /><br />The software that comes with the hardware is crap. Download the latest one from Logitech's site which is really good. You can fully customize tour gamepad via the software. The installation and configuration is pretty easy too. Haven't tried the macros as of yet but I hope they would be great too.<br /><br />One funny thing is the LCD display on the pad. You would never look at it while you are engrossed in some high tension action game.<br /><br />Nevertheless I am thoroughly enjoying my game pad and yes it saves my laptop's keyboard from the undesired hard presses, random multiple hits that take place during gaming.
B0090EHVMC|2.0|I loved The Lorax as a kid.  i loved the book, and I loved the cartoon that would come as an evening special on network tv.  I was extremely excited when I saw it would be made into a full length film, and couldn't wait to see it.  I would have watched it in the theatre, but I couldn't swing the funds at that time, and when I could I had other things I needed to do.<br /><br />So when it came available to rent online, i did it.  I was pretty disappointed.  Not so much for the story, or anything that was great, and that is why it got two stars.  The songs ruined the whole movie.  It would be one thing to have intelligent, humourous lyrics to add to the film.  That would have been ok.  However, the songs were inane, idiotic and did not add anything to the film.  In fact they were very irritating, and as I stated before ruined the whole thing.  If you want to watch it, that is your choice...however I will not be purchasing this film.
1455502758|4.0|Just as he embarked on a tour to promote his memoir HITCH-22 in June 2010, Christopher Hitchens was diagnosed with Stage Four esophageal cancer. \\"The thing about Stage Four,\\" he writes with his customary directness, \\"is that there is no such thing as Stage Five.\\" Nineteen months later, he died of pneumonia in a Houston hospital. In that interval, which included debilitating chemotherapy and radiation treatments that brought with them side effects often more painful than the disease that was \\"battling him,\\" Hitchens wrote for Vanity Fair magazine the seven blunt, combative, unfailingly honest essays collected in MORTALITY.<br /><br />As much as can be done in a work that encompasses fewer than 100 pages of his words, the book offers a snapshot of what made Hitchens' opinionated, intellectually wide-ranging and usually infuriating (to someone) work so captivating. He was \\"one of life's singular characters,\\" as his Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter puts it in a foreword to this slim volume, and nothing in these parting essays contradicts that description.<br /><br />When Hitchens' diagnosis became public, there was much speculation about questions like whether perhaps the world's most unabashed atheist would renounce his beliefs and embrace religion, or how he felt about the many people (including prominent clergy and theologians he'd battled in public debate) who earnestly offered prayers for his recovery. Hitchens quickly dispels any doubt on the first point, vowing to \\"continue to write polemics against religious delusions, at least until its hello darkness my old friend.\\"<br /><br />While Hitchens is mildly grateful to the \\"quite reputable Catholics, Jews and Protestants who think that I might in some sense of the word be worth saving,\\" he's quick to \\"sympathize afresh with the mighty Voltaire, who, when badgered on his deathbed and urged to renounce the devil, murmured that this was no time to be making enemies.\\" And as much as he would like to discourage the people who insisted on praying for him, he at least acknowledges the possibility that their intercessions might serve the purpose of making them feel better. In one of the fragments of unwritten essays gathered in a concluding chapter, he observes, \\"If I convert it's because it's better that a believer dies than that an atheist does.\\" It doesn't require a careful parsing of these sentiments to understand that Hitchens left this world clinging firmly to his atheist convictions.<br /><br />But Hitchens doesn't confine himself to philosophical musings or score settling with his theological rivals here. Some of the book's most riveting passages are its most intensely personal, detailing, as they do, Hitchens' darkest moments in the place he names \\"Tumorville,\\" as he makes the journey \\"from the country of the well across the stark frontier that marks off the land of malady.\\" He devotes an entire essay to debunking Nietzsche's pronouncement that \\"whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger,\\" concluding it with a grim description of the mounting difficulty phlebotomists encounter trying to draw blood from his battered veins. When his voice and hands begin to fail him, he's keenly attuned to the irony that the two instruments that have fueled his career may be the first gifts taken from him.<br /><br />Yet even amid this account of illness, decline and death, Hitchens' caustic wit remains undiminished. Writing of one website comment that predicted an agonizing death followed by eternal damnation as his well-deserved fate, he observes, \\"The vengeful deity has a sadly depleted arsenal if all he can think of is exactly the cancer that my age and former `lifestyle' would suggest that I got.\\" And he confesses to what would be a sense of irritation if he \\"pulled through and the pious faction contentedly claimed that their prayers had been answered.\\"<br /><br />Hitchens' widow, Carol Blue, concludes the book with a touching tribute to her late husband. Describing a typical \\"raucous, joyous, impromptu eight-hour dinner\\" at the family's Washington, DC apartment, she recalls Hitchens rising to proclaim, \\"How good it is to be us.\\" There's nothing in that heartfelt sentiment to suggest any sense of overweening pride. Instead, it rings out gloriously as the expression of joy of a man intoxicated by his zest for all that life offers. It's no consolation to his family to say this, but Christopher Hitchens lived every day of his 62 years fully and deeply. He wished for more, and whether or not we shared his views, we, his readers, shared that wish.<br /><br />Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg

B008JFLWLE|5.0|it is surprisingly accurate in converting my scribbles into equations.  if there is one way to make it perfect for my use, it would be to allow variables which can be entered into the math and hot change the value outside the equation. ( a + 4 = 4; a = 3 now makes it total 7 etc)
0385344333|5.0|You may find yourself wanting to read A WANTED MAN twice. The first time through, you will read it simply for the joy of another encounter with Jack Reacher, Child's iconic creation. The (relatively) silent but deadly former Army MP prefers no ties and minimal (if any) contact with his fellow human beings, yet attracts and is drawn to trouble with a force as immutable as gravity. You will want to read it a second time to carefully examine not so much what Child has done as the way he has done it. Through a good portion of the book, he takes the tedium of driving on and across the middle of the United States highway system and transforms it into an act infused with suspense and quiet danger, one where an explosive and deadly ending lies in wait.<br /><br />A WANTED MAN begins practically where WORTH DYING FOR left off, with Reacher in the middle of a very cold and dark nowhere called Nebraska. He is picked up by a car that is occupied by two men and a woman. They drive, stopping only for gas, food and the like, and talk endlessly. As the four passengers head east into the night, a grisly tableau is unfolding behind them. A gentleman, his veracity as a witness somewhat diminished by inebriation, has observed three men enter a small isolated concrete bunker, but only two of them walk out. The third is subsequently found inside the bunker, the victim of a violent murder. We learn very gradually the connection between what the somewhat impaired witness saw and the two men in the car who picked up Reacher, along with the identity of the woman, where she came from and why.<br /><br />Reacher makes some assumptions based on what he knows, and the more he learns, the more those assumptions change. Of course he is unaware of what has gone before, or what is occurring even as the increasingly uneasy quartet drives into the promise of the day's new dawn. Meanwhile, the discovery of that body has set off a chain reaction that involves a full alphabet soup of government agencies,including the FBI and CIA, as well as another set or two of eyes that are from the more secretive nether regions of the State Department.<br /><br />Someone eventually catches up with Reacher, though not with the other three passengers, in a classic tableau that you can only truly appreciate if you've dealt extensively with night clerks in hotels just east of nowhere. By this time, Reacher is compelled to jump in, particularly when what has happened --- and what subsequently happens --- officially turns into one of those \\"nothing to see here, move along\\" situations. And when Reacher is ultimately taken into custody to keep him from muddying up the works, he really becomes interested.<br /><br />Reacher, forming an unlikely and somewhat uneasy alliance with a Federal law enforcement officer, slowly but surely follows a trail based on two-thirds evidence and one-third intuition that, in turn, results in semi-technophobe Reacher being dragged kicking and screaming into this century. At the end of the trail is a major operation, hidden in plain view, that gives Reacher the opportunity to disrupt a world-wide terrorist network, if he can survive the encounter. The odds, however, are stacked against him. In spades.<br /><br />If you thought that Child had rung all of the action out of Nebraska and its contiguous states that he could, then think again. You'll never drive along a lonesome stretch of six-lane late at night, or past one of its no-name exits, without thinking of A WANTED MAN, Reacher, or what might be waiting at the top of the off-ramp.<br /><br />Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
1441308512|4.0|After reading the reviews, I was prepared for two things:<br />1) I was going to have to stretch it a bit to fit my Kindle 4 properly<br />2) It was going to make my bag smell rubbery (it is neoprene)<br /><br />It came in the mail quickly, and:<br />1) It fit my Kindle perfectly - no stretching<br />2) My bag didn't smell at all<br /><br />I will say this:<br />1) I love this case.  I wanted something slim, that zips & protects my Kindle.  I didn't want a bulky case trying to double as a wallet or a padfolio.<br />2) I carry a big bag full of folders and work stuff, I can find this case easily amongst all my items.<br />3) I wish this company had a few more choices in their design selection.  I had to settle on this design.  It's not horrible, but not necessarily my style either.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|Stephen King has done it again, with a book that keeps you turning the pages. Well, at least tapping your screen. Always a fan!
B0087HT36U|4.0|Addictive and helps to pass some time. Similar concept to angry birds. Done in a fun and creative app. Good buy.
B007STBUHI|5.0|What's not bad, however, is this movie and DVD. The movie speaks for itself so I don't have to review the film. The DVD set itself has great picture and sound with a colorful and history filled flip cover. The extras are interesting to watch which take you back to the shooting days; told by those who inspired and made what we know the movie to be today possible.
B001IXSU8M|4.0|I waited around for a long time to buy this album; I wanted to get it as inexpensively as I could.  It's fun, listenable and VERY danceable.  My only dislike is my own fault; Gaga sounds young because she IS young.  She reminds me of Gwen Stefani on more than one track (and that's not a bad thing in itself).  But do add it to your Gaga collection - the Lady does not disappoint.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As always Nicholas Sparks brings us another love story from the Carolina coast - and with a new and fresh perspective.  I would very much recommend this book.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest. I enjoy having the app on my kindle so I can access  it almost any where. the only think I don't like is sometimes when I go to open it only a whit screen appears and not the normal pinterest screen. when this happens I need to exit out and reopen the app. it usually works fine after. its a small technical thing. other than that, love it.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|This is one of my favorites and this was the last one of the set I have been purchasing.  Great movie with the originals from the earlier movies.
1451673442|4.0|Quite inspiring. However, my only complaint is that the book doesnt contain references to backup her claims about scientific studies or other mentions.
B0067DBHBU|5.0|One of Daughtry's best albums.  Rock, ballads and fun songs.  He shows his sensitive side with \\"Gone to Soon\\"<br />and he rocker side with \\"Renegrade\\". \\"Louder than Ever\\"  brings back those memories of young love and carefree days.\\"Rescue Me\\" could be viewed with many areas of life.  Great words to go with the melody.  I would recommend this ablum. I love the words that go with the songs.  I'm not one just hooked on the music.  A rocker with many layers.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was a bit far fetched but it kept you reading to find out how bizarre it could get.
B0053FANQS|5.0|I enjoy the whole series of The Fast and Furious, etc.  I am purchasing for my collection of movies.  Filled with lots of car action, race and chase.  Love this movie.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Tempest is, admittedly, for those who Joan Baez calls \\"True Believers\\" only.  If this is your first exposure to Bob, the odds of your becoming an instant fan are a million to one.  This album is for those of us who have never heard a 1 or 2 star Dylan album.  Even his arguable \\"worst\\" albums offered up gems like Brownsville Girl and Silvio.<br /><br />My very first reaction was, \\"Why all this gratuitous violence?\\" but I got over that in no time.  I think it's at least as good as Love & Theft, perhaps better.  Then again, my \\"favorite\\" Dylan output changes all the time.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find that Duquesne Whistle might be, lyrically, the weakest song on the entire album.  And it didn't take long to figure out that the bizarre video had more to do with the album than that song.  Narrow Way is about, I read elsewhere -- his critics?  Maybe, but as always he speaks on many levels.  The If-I-can't-get-up-to-you, you-have-to-come-down-to-me line is just as much about all of his relationships - Critics?  Yes.  God?  Yes.  Lovers?  Absolutely.  Expectations be damned.  This is a reminder that he's \\"got nothing more to live up to.\\"  And speaking of critics, and his voice, I think his biggest slap at them is the satisfaction on his face as he sucks his stogie on the inside cover, bringing his tobacco and whiskey drenched throat to the level of perfection they so despise.<br /><br />The melodies generally go where I would not expect.  I'm no musician, but the songs are performed in unusual keys.  Flat notes.  Minor chords.  High notes where you expect low and vice versa.  Clapton once said that was Dylan's genius, and it shows here.  Not much you can dance to here unless you want to waltz along with Tempest or jerk awkwardly to Whistle.  Listen to Muddy Waters' Mannish Boy. Then listen to Early Roman Kings.  Love or Theft?  Probably both, except he returns to the scene of an earlier crime.  This is the song where Muddy growled, \\"I'm a rolling stone.\\"<br/><br />Lyrically, he swipes not obscure, but classic lines from Paul Simon's Feelin' Groovy, and from the Beatles:  Twist & Shout, A Day in the Life, The Ballad of John and Yoko, and Come Together.  Three of these are in obvious homage to Lennon, and I am sure there are several more that I missed.<br /><br />Women.  These are not the same creatures in his earlier works who ache and have warehouse eyes and are mystical children and who he splits with on dark sad nights or make him lonesome when they go.  Nope.  Tempest is populated with wenches and bitches and hags and flat-chested junky whores.  And murderers.  By the way, I wonder what the body count is when you put all these songs together?<br /><br />Tempest, the song, is both a waltz and an Irish sea chantey; he even chops off his words like an Irish troubador every time he brings up the dreamin' watchman.  Soon after Midnight is baffling; I'm not sure who killed Two-Timing Slim (\\"whoever heard of him?\\") but his corpse was dragged through the mud.  I LOVE Long and Wasted Years.  The repetitive seven note descent into complacency.  They cried.  Therapeutic?  Healing?  Nope.  \\"So much for tears.\\"  Pay in Blood (\\"but not my own\\") is vicious, disturbing, vengeful - in fact my adult son said he would not like to meet this psychopath in real life, the song is as close as he wants to get to the narrator of this madness.<br /><br />Finally, at first listen I thought Roll on John was contrived and out of time and place on this album.  Too gentle and saccharine.  On second listen I appreciated the melody, but assumed this must be a decades-old outtake, rerecorded in his \\"new\\" voice (sarcasm intended).  On third listen, I thought it was the most remarkable use of his voice on the album.  Now it's the one song that is stuck in my head.  Go figure.<br /><br />If you've made it this far, I thank you.  Now, if we can just get Tom Waits and Bob to sing some harmony at the next Grammies we're all set.
B003VANOFY|1.0|had these headsets for almost a year now, can't talk to my friends on Skype or team speak without the mic stop picking up my voice in mid chat. They worked great when I first got them, but now, they are a 100 dollar piece of crap. I would not recommend these to anybody unless you like spending your money on the turds that Logitech calls headsets.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|this a a adobe product what more can I say other than it works the same on the kindle as it works on any other operating system
B0087HT36U|5.0|great game really fun cant stop playin i love how its like angry birds just better buy this game you wont be mad
B005LAIHAE|3.0|This is one of those \\"What the flipping deuces was that all about (amazon made me edit it)\\" films but it is a harmless enough shoot em up and more importantly features some \\"subtle\\" product placement for Audi, including a comical shot introducing a scene is a square where the panning shot is interrupted by a detour to feature a large poster fo the Audi A1, which is featured later in the film in the climactic chase scene. Bruce Willis e-mailed his performance in and Sigourney Weaver I think was cut and pasted from the identical role when she was a CIA agent helping some lad who had some mistaken identity thing, and his dad was a spy and some people with guns was chasing him, and he had to do something in a football or baseball game at the end. So thats cleared that up then.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|Very educational movie about great artist explaining his roots and now songs are more meaningful. Good combination of interviews with people he lived with and documentary.
0061122416|5.0|This book will teach you to look at life in a different way. It will really change your life with a thought-provoking parable.
B008C20TDG|5.0|What can I say other than this book and these two people are amazing, life changing.  If you don't want to follow a Paleo-way of eating or, you don't believe in excluding grains, sugars, etc from your current diet, at least this book will help you understand how food is processed internally and what it does to our hormones.<br /><br />I've bought several copies for friends and family and, continue to do so.<br /><br />Try the Whole30, i promise you will feel a difference.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would highly recommend this book as it contained a little of everything from drama, mystery, and suspense!  There are lots of twists and turns that leave the reader wanting more!  I couldnt put it down!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|This is a great movie in every way. It will definitely change your mood in a positive way. It is an allegorical story and you will find a lot in it.<br /><br />All in all, a great watch.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My family saw this movie in the theater and couldn't wait for it to come out on blu-ray! We bought the combo pack so we could get the digital copy. It was so easy to do!!! Thanks Amazon!!<br />My girls sing the songs all day long!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Nice to see that one of the hottest and best selling games for smartphones and tablets is now free on the Kindle Fire :) Thank you Amazon. The games graphics and audio are a solid 5 stars from this user!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Im a huge Reacher fan...this installment was a bust. Interesting start then blah. Couldn't wait for it to be over. I think the Reacher series may need an overhaul or some major shake up.  Wish I could rate it higher, but this one is weak.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|Utterly charming. You will not want the story to end, and you will, in fact, find it will stay with you for some time to come.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book and I couldn't put it down! You really get to know the characters and feel their emotions when things happen in the book! Great author!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A very good app, especially for free. It opens when you begin charging, but still allows you tho go back to the exact spot you were. Adds are minimal and unobtrusive. V. Good app!
B005LAIHGI|1.0|A friend and I went to see this in the theaters the day it came out and I wish I could get my $19 back. The movie was terrible. I love usually love this type of movie, but this one just didn't do it for me. The stereotypes and jokes were much to predictable and more often than not they were taken too far. For the record, most people are not so stupid that you have to shove the same thing in their face twelve times just for them to understand the already moronic excuse for a joke. This is not worth anyone's time. Even if they think that this movie is worth their time, its not. It needs to go away. Parody comedy at its worst in The Dictator. Fail upon the writers and directors.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Awesome app! I could spend hours and hours on it. So many great ideas all in one spot. Love it!!!!!!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I LOVED the Lost Hero! it has the thrilling plot that keeps you thumbing through the pages. So HATERS, STOP IT! I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T THINK RICK RIORDAN ISN'T YOUR FAVORITE AUTHOR, BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NICE TO SAY, SHUT UP AND DON'T SAY ANYTHING!!! &#62;:(
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I had the 2nd and third on PDF so I only needed to purchase the first book. I didn't like the ending though. Can't wait to see the movie!
1400032717|4.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, by Mark Haddon, is an insightful look at autism through the eyes of the main character, Christopher Boone, a 15 year old autistic boy. The story is written in his point of view, him writing a novel to you, the reader. From the very first page you can see that this book is unlike any you've ever read, or at least any that I had ever read. It starts on chapter two, and you notice that the rest of the books chapters do not seem to be in an orthodox manner, but then you find out this boy's enthusiasm for Mathematics and Physics, and that really he has chosen to label his Chapters with prime numbers. That may not be the first thing you as a reader notices, but if it's not that's okay because the first thing he tells you about is how he is standing in front of the neighbor's dog. Then the cover makes a little more sense. Reading has become more and more important in today's classrooms, and autism has become more and more prevalent in today's school. I'm in school working on becoming a high school mathematics teacher and I personally think this is a great book to incorporate, math as well as students in special education. As we progress in schools inclusion is becoming more predominant and you are likely to have classrooms with a variety of students in them. I hope to be able to use this book in the future to have my students read, as it is rather rare in my opinion to find a book about math that is able to reach such a diverse crowd. I think it is a good opportunity to engage students in learning about math in a different and entertaining way, while also connecting with someone they may not ordinarily associate with. By reading this book you get to see autism from another side, another point of view. It's not like reading a text book about the subject or doctor's journals; it is a reader friendly canvas. Christopher is not in an inclusive school, but that doesn't mean he has no contact with other children his age, or withthe rest of the community. In part of the book he talks about kids from the other school calling him names. It is heartwarming getting to know Christopher, learning about what he likes, and how he sees the world, and how he sees the people around him.  In Christopher's journey to solve the mystery of his neighbor's dog he encounters many different people and also finds out the answers to some other mysteries along the way. He faces fears and challenges that not only come with be autistic, but come with being a teenager and with being human.  In the end, whether you like mathematics or hate it, whether you know someone who has autism or not, this book is an enthralling read from cover to cover, and may open you up to a whole world of new things.
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|Fantasy. Allegorical. Classic literary (even if it's not Brit Lit). Directors and actors seem pathologically compelled to use a British accent whenever we're sitting down for a good bit of storytelling. For pete's sake, they went to the trouble of reintroducing many original Grimms' bits, previously all but lost to countless flowery Disney variations on this story. So if you're going to force an accent, why not the original German?  German or Brit, phoney accents add nothing to the quality of the dialog; in fact, it ends up emphasizing weaknesses in the script. And when principals lack either the natural skill or coaching required to pull it off, busted dialects are a huge distraction. Now, adorable rake Chris Hemsworth handled the Scots brogue a bit better than the bizarre British accent he attempted in \\"Thor.\\" But Kristen Stewart had no idea on which side of the road she was driving (ooh, surprise), and even Theron occasionally struggled with sounding like a high school production of My Fair Lady.<br /><br />With that said, it was a visual feast. Turn off the sound and watch some really gorgeous camera/lighting work and creative CGI that actually adds to the film rather than being just more shameless lily-gilding. I had to watch the mirror morphing and raven dress splat/reconstituting bits a couple of times. It's a beautiful movie and not entirely without merit. Get the HD/Blu-ray version, pop some corn and enjoy the show. But Hollywood, let's stop with the affected dialog. Meryl Streep's already won every award we'll give out for canned accents.
B009329ZF2|2.0|What a waste of Liam Neeson. He was given very little to say and nothing to do. All we get are those unknown yong actors trying to get famous dominating the entire story who are as intersting as any metalic piece of debri blown away by aliens.
B004SF30HI|3.0|My grandchildren, a pair of 2 year old boys loved the movie so much I bought them the sound track.<br />When they heard the music it absolutely confused them since they kept on looking at the TV screen<br />for the images not understanding it was just the sound track.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Bought this for my Kindle app on my iPad.  Love this book and am about to purchase the second one.
B007MJT1K2|4.0|Completely enjoyable film.<br />Plot was so good that after a short while I didn't even notice it was animated.<br />Speaking of the animation, that in itself was so well done that one can only marvel at the level  of realism achieved.<br />Do see this movie.<br />Dg
B007XIC1GI|5.0|THIS IS NOT A BOOK ITS A EPIC STUFF OR A BOOK THING STUFF EPICLY AWESOME READ OR DIE A DEADLY DEATH AND DIE BUFFY HEGDE H0G SMOSH RESIDENT EVIL FAT GUY MAYBE!#%&$
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I Loved the ending of this third book  of the trilogy. the middle of the book dragged a bit,  but .worth. reading.
