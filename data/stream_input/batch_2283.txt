B007UR1OHO|1.0|The First problem is Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams had no chemistry. I thought it was a love story but the whole movie was about poor, pathetic, entitled Paige and her manipulative family. This is not a love story. It is foolishness!
0545128285|5.0|My 7 year old grandson has been reading this aloud for me when he visits.Not an easy reading book for someone so young but he's doing good with it. He shares a love for Harry Potter with me and it's a joy to hear him read
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I'm still learning - but it is great to identify songs. How often have I wondered the name or artist of a tune? Often! This app is wonderful!
1440503257|5.0|I have tried a few of these recipes like Molly's meatballs with onion sauce and the Herby Roast Chicken with onion-garlic mashed potatoes. My family loved them as well
B00BF11STU|5.0|Awesome movie, a real eye opener.  Lots of action.  It gave me a new appreciation for the folks who dedicate their lives to keep our homeland safe.  A heartfelt thank- you to all of them!
B004HXIZVC|2.0|If you are familiar with sound hound and looking for something that is comparable at a cheaper price, this is not it
B0030B621W|5.0|This is one of those movies you have to pay attention to; but it's well worth the effort.  Same Rockwell always seems to nail the characters he plays and it continually underrated by some.  Watched this with my daughter and enjoyed it.
B005COO1X6|5.0|What a great horror story !  Loved the young hero !  This is a fantastic read of total science fiction of the most fun and weird kind.  And that is why Stephen King is so great !
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really easy to use. Clear. Adds every so often. Totally worth it. If you do random shuffle it's really hard.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|while you may not agree with the war, you have to know and appreciate our men and women in the armed services and the struggles they encounter serving both away and at home. Great read.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Our son is a musician and after seeing this I had to buy it for him.  He's watched it several times already.  Great history of a dying art form that the best rock and rollers of all time bring back to life.  Highly recommend!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think this game is fun and cool. It gives me something to do after school. So that is y I like subway surfer
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Don't be afraid of the running time, it flies right by.<br />Great music, great sets, great acting and wonderful cinematography.<br />I have not read The Hobbit, so I cannot say if it follows the story line or not.<br />My only complaint was some of it was a bit Indiana Jonesish.  A little too coy and snippy in some places.  The movie can stand on its own without \\"dumbing it down\\" or trying to be cutesy.  I am glad there was not excessive Gollum in this one.  I know the effect is cool but I think there was way too much focus on him in TLOR trilogy when more time could have been spent on the other events.<br />All in all a great Saturday afternoon movie and I am excited to see the other two installments.
B00A1AF4DM|5.0|I began reading this one night before bed.  I finished it by 2:30am.  I couldn't put it down!  It was just a fun adventure story.  It kind of reminded me of Jurassic Park when the group is trying to fight their way to safety.  It was just FUN FUN FUN to read!  No - not a deep, psychological thriller, but I loved it!
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|I rated this So highly because I know their story and love the music.  I plan to buy more of their music.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Funny in the beginning, but then pretty depressing and just sad the rest of the way. Doesn't exactly set the right message either &#34;let's just ignore our problems and hope they go away&#34;.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Page turner, though the ending was a bit of a let down. I really could not predict story line so pleasantly surprised.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The series was better than expected! I'd gladly read more!!! Great characterization. I would love to read the ENTIRE thing from Christians perspective.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|My son reviewed this as I have never played the game. He has both and said he prefers the first one. He said the first one has more gadgets that you can &#34;buy&#34; which makes it more fun. This one is more chalenging, however.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|Came in perfect condition and plays without a problem. This is by far one of my favorite series of all time.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie is excellent for kids and adults alike.  It is a must see for any anime fan.  So good.
B001BNFR6W|3.0|Some of the episodes skip when played and some won't even play. So far this is just one the first season.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I believe Richard Dawkins has done a great effort sharing his knowledge to the world, and encourages us to question the big problems in today's society. If you're willing to explore religion, and question it (which we all are allowed to), this is going to be a great book for you. I would like more religious people to read it.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Shipped on time, in perfect condition. This is loaded with tons of cool extras that will keep you busy. Tis is one of my favorite Diseny movies of all time.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was worth the time to watch and the lead woman was very believable as well as energetic. Five stars from JP. Thank you!
B0091REZMW|4.0|good visuals fun great game. just wish the gems were earned In the game more.  the rooms change all time so reentering is still a challange.
030746363X|5.0|Reads more like a textbook.  Great information, simple and straight forward.  Get it if you are serious about making a change to your body.
B007N6NGYG|3.0|I believe this game is ok because, i have played some better train guiding games on apple devices. This game is the best I've played on the kindle fire. The best Amazon have to offer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever seen! Acting is phenomenal, leads to great character development. Great look into this time period!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Bloons TD 5 had amazing gameplay on my PC and I absolutely loved it. Once I discovered that it was out on the Amazon app store I decided to try it out and I was blown away!! The graphics are superb and all the features on the PC like the special missions and special agents were added into the game making the experience even more EPIC!! Anyway, this game is a &quot;must buy&quot;. This game is excellent and family friendly as well. No blood, no gore and no violence of any sort. Just monkeys popping balloons. Again I really recommend this game and make sure you have a lot of free time because you will be playing this game day and night:)
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This CD blew my mind. Very awesome music, I love listening to it. Easy to move to and totally gets you in the mood to sing!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun but you have to practice a lot!! In a couple minutes you will be good!! Really fun game so addicting! Download it!!! :)
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It's functional, and basic.  Not a knock out of the park, but just fine for waking up in the morning!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This brought me back to high school and growing up. You feel for all of the characters, especially Charlie. Can't wait to watch the movie (I mean film lol).
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I found it to be thoroughly entertaining and great fun to watch.  It was a real escape and I looked forward to each new episode.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I got the kindle originally to occupy my subway commute - and got hooked on this almost immediately!  Thumbs up!
B007712XAU|5.0|Outstanding acting on the part of all of the characters.  Actually the production is outstanding in every way:  Acting, camera work, screenplay, costumes, sets, historic accuracy, everything.  It's hard to imagine anyone not liking the production.  No doubt I'll watch it again at some time in the future.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I had heard and readonly rave reviews f the latest 007 film.i missed in it theatrers, but knew I had thave it to keep my 007 collection upto date. My wife and I started &#34;SKYFALL&#34; Friday and finished it, last night.It  was just the right combination of 007 action and intepersonal drama.The Blu-rayis Big and Bold and Loud and totally awesome!
B000067D8W|5.0|This is a great addition for any true Smallville fan! It came in the mail with really good packaging. Everything was in great condition. If you're a true Smallville fan, GET THIS!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Great acting, great writing, great direction and production values combine to make Downton Abbey a great series. A touch of history is added because it is base in the 1920s.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|My husband and I watch Same Time, Next Year every year around our anniversary and always get a laugh out of it.  It's a classic that will never get old.  It's really unusual because they are really the only people in the movie.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Worthy of an Oscar.  Pretty intrigueing and suspenseful from beginning to end.  Not for kids or conspiracy theorists.  A country has to do what a country has to do.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved it! This series has yet to let me down thus far. I can't wait to start the third book. Going to buy it right now and get started!! Definitely worth a read!
030758836X|4.0|Giving this 4 stars - probably more like 3.5 but I'll round up.  The characters weren't likeable and the 'twists' were seen coming a mile away, but the beginning of Part 2 of the book, even though you could totally see it coming, was still fun to read. I'd say Part 1 and most of Part 2 were pretty good, but then it just gets ridiculous and seems like a rush to a conclusion.  So many loose ends that ... hey, I'm not a cop, but the whole case and clues and answers for said clues seem really, really weak.  I can't imagine them buying this and I would think there would be plenty of ways the police could have arrested him/her (don't want to spoil).  The ending didn't bother me because of what happened as much as that it didn't make sense.  Surely he/she could have gotten a confession SOMEHOW on tape.  Bug the soap bottle in the shower, a mic placed very low in the ear canal - I don't know!  But overall, I liked the book well enough.
B000W292C8|5.0|It does not get any better than this.  It is old but never out of style, one to have in your library
B00364K6YW|4.0|I also own the BBC DVD \\"Special Edition (2 disks). This \\"Restored Edition, in my opinion does not look as good as my \\"Special Edition\\". The flesh tones on faces etc. looks much better with the special edition than this restored edition on my HDTV and Analog TV's.<br /><br />Having said that, this Pride and Prejudice DVD is terrific so far as the actors, content and story goes. One of the best I have ever seen.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|It's always tough to reinvent a movie; this was a pretty good effort. I preferred the storyline of the original but the action and special effects in this version were excellent.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The perfect combination for me - I can play for two minutes or twenty, it's amusing and it's just challenging enough that I feel proud when I figure out what to do, but don't get so frustrated I stop playing.  I found this after I finished Where's My Water? which is the same kind of game and which I also very much enjoyed.
B00B7H3OFI|5.0|What can I say? A masterpiece of sonic delight from a group of highly skilled musicians and all around great guys!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was great! Some of the passages are quite graphic and a little disturbing, but clearly necessary for the plot and accuracy. I couldn't put the book down for days. I even read at the gym on the elliptical, while walking home, on the subway, basically everywhere. I would recommend this book to any friend or colleague - especially for a book club.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|literally download youtube videos what else can i say it works like it advertises have not had a problem yet the only thing i wish it would go straight micro sd instead of phones memory
B009FZHYKU|5.0|DANG RICK - Y'ALL GOT SUM CRAZINESS GOIN ON UP IN DARE! 4-EAL yo - HIT ME UP IF U NEED SOME KICKIN BUNNIES AND PONIEZ WHEN THE GUVNA COMZE A NOCKIN! WHAAAAAT!  I WUNDER IF GWAR ARE ZOMBIES NOWADAYZ - werd
B002QHH22O|5.0|Great rock and roll but NOT for kids there are some things on here that make me cringe but they know to rock out!!!!!\m/..\m/
B009FZHYKU|5.0|At first the zombies bothered me, but the main characters hooked me.  Darryl is my favorite. Silent but strong. Loved them all
B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|Luke's back.  The guitar work and the writing are exceptional. I would highly recommend this album.  Everybody needs this one.
B0094K1QR8|3.0|Typical tintalating flic that focuses on a beautiful young doctor that's life consists of no romantic commitment until she finds a good for nothing poet. Standard fare.
0307341550|4.0|I do like this author.  She is fresh and imaginative in her stories and writing style.  This is her first book before the overhyped Gone Girl came out.<br /><br />It is of a similar style to Gone Girl where the story builds up bit by bit and you learn new details about the characters in small ways that help the story build and progress.  It takes about a third of the book to actually get absorbed in it but this is down to the style as you cannot get into the characters until she reveals just the right amount of information about them - again very similar to the build up in Gone Girl.<br /><br />I did guess the two \\"twists\\" that came towards the end but this did not lessen my enjoyment of the story as I was intrigued to see how they would be handled.<br /><br />My criticism is about the end.  It all felt rather rushed and sometimes convenient.  I wanted the end to be written in a lot more detail and, after thinking about it for a while, I would have loved a full flashback section about life in the Preaker home when Marian was still alive and perhaps more detail about Camille's future at the end.<br /><br />I think an author with more experience would have made this a fantastic must read novel instead of the good, read if you can novel.  4 out of 5 from me and certainly an author I will enjoy reading in the future.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|For anyone who loves the smell of books (Barnes and Noble), this book will intoxicate you.  Throughout the book Sloan keeps you guessing what will come next (fools you every time). Enough mystery and likable characters to keep you reading to the very last word.
B006VA3ZEG|1.0|I bought the second season of Downton Abbey. Is not steaming, so I paid for it but I cannot see it. What is going on? Can I get my money back?
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I was not able to gewt to the theater to see Life of Pi.  I'm so glad I read the book!  Imagination of the story had me wanting to read to the end  but never wanting the story to end.  Maybe I'll see the movie or maybe not, but the book I will read again.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|It is a little bit of a drag and quite exaggerated.  I am not sure I would recommend to anyone.  I am having a difficult<br />time finishing it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is pretty sweat, but there are a few things I want to say to anyone who is going to by this. Note that the world is not endless like the computer game. There are no endearment and you cant craft everything you can in the computer game. however, I'm not saying its a bad game at all. it has its limits, but is definetly five star worthy.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The Harry Potter series are the best movies that everyone should see, never read the books but they must also be great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this game..its amazing and the 3d effect is beautiful. the horses are cute and the completion is brutal but say what...my horses get true
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Its the new social correspondence but very difficult for a matured, retired person to grasp. Great for the younger generations with the digital ablilities. Actually I feel it is a high tech gossip page.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|I read this book on holiday and couldn't put it down. It is a gripping, thought provoking tale of a mother, trying to come to terms with her son's crime of killing fellow students at his school. It explores the theme of exactly who are the victims in this crime. We rarely think of the family of the perpetrator and how they have to live with the aftermath of the crime also. They are frequently blamed and unjustly bare the guilt of the crime. The story is told in letters from the mother to her husband. They are letters in which she attempts to explore their different parenting of their son, Kevin and to examine if she could have done something to avert what happened. This book draws you into her world and it is told with such skill that I found myself wondering what I would have done if in her shoes. It is rarely sentimental yet this tale has stayed with me, long after the last page was read. Are parents always to blame for the behaviour of their children or does nature sometimes win over nurture? To say anymore would be to reveal a story that everyone should read because we all should talk about Kevin.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Fun to play, just like the old &quot;space invaders&quot;.  I recommend for anyone who wants to relax for a few minutes and play.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|love it, i have seem it three times , a great movie to watch has everthing you want........so watch it
1401235417|5.0|Snyder and Capullo deliver a batman story that is original and one that i actually cared to read. Capullo is a master of comics Storytelling!  this is a must read even if just for the pictures
B005NFWCSK|4.0|This was a great movie. Only downside was there was no original actor's. However its a prequel so its understandable.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a good one , have been playing it for hours.  Lots of fun and a good challenge to go farther into the game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoyed this series very much. Can't wait for the next season. However, please bring back the guy that was killed in the last episode of Season 3.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Photo editor works quite well on my Samsung Galaxy Rugby Pro. The interface is easy to use and does great work on images.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|the language was fantastic and painted emotions.The characters were very believable and so heroic in their living of life and love
B00514HDNW|4.0|This book kept me curious and on the edge of my seat. I enjoyed reading it. I would recommend it to any one who enjoys books about vampires. Give this one a try  I did and am glad I did
B005EI86JU|4.0|Easy to follow, with recommendations by the author for camera settings and his reasons for using these settings. Much handier than the book included with camera.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|This is a movie that I knew I would purchase and add to my collection as soon as I was 20 minutes into the showing at the theaters.<br /><br />There are additional features on this collection that make it the ultimate purchase and addition to your collection. The hopping eggs were a nice addition to the purchase.<br /><br />If you loved it in the theaters, you will love to watch it over and over.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This has to be one of the best worry free ideas to keep your Plantronics headset safe and charged.  It does the job well.  Plus you don't have to worry about easily loosing your headset when your not using it since the case is easy to identify.  A MUST have accessory!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is a good way to chill when you have down time.  Try it you'll have fun. 2 thumbs up.
B004TI5N38|4.0|At first, it seemed like some trivial, local story, but it ended up with national implications.  The bad guys were not who I expected, but it made sense in the end.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I never knew what was coming next with this book, kept me in suspense right until the end of the book....
B000FBJAEG|4.0|It took me a while to figure out who is the hero and who is the bad guy.  There are so many crimes to investigate and so many people from so many agencies investigating the crimes that it is hard to keep track in the first half of the novel.  After you get that squared away in your head, then it is a good read.
B005IQZB14|4.0|When one thinks of &#34;wild&#34;, one's mind turns to autopilot equating to &#34;sex&#34;. This emotionally written, heart-warming book leads us to open our minds to endless possibilities other than the obvious! Out-of-the-box thinking and reasoning---faraway dreams and obsessions bending toward triangle barriers. We might be able to break out of our molds and become more of a oneness to our own self.  Four Stars mean better than most of the best reads, but not quite the top of my list! Although, as I am pondering my rating- I might just change my mind, because I can!
B00AJER3SE|4.0|This review is for the the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  I was pleased with this newly remastered version of Terminator.  The previous blu-ray release was not good at all.  This one is significantly improved.  While there is still some film grain, especially in low-light shots, it is not distracting.  The level of detail is significantly sharpened.  One downside of the improved clarity, however, is that certain closeups of Arnold Schwarzenegger's face now reveal the makeup and special effects.  Oh well, you cannot have it all!<br /><br />If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, the 2013 version is worth it; the 2006 version is not.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game. My kids play it all the time. Better graphics and maneuverability than the first. Would recommend to anyone wanting a fun game with some challenge.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|This review is for the quality of the blu-ray transfer and not the film itself.  The blu-ray version of Lawrence of Arabia is stunning.  The color saturation and tones are perfect.  The level of detail is so fine at times that it is almost as if you are seeing the characters and scenes in real life.  This is exactly what a viewer wants with a movie full of scenic vistas and exotic locations, like this one.  The sound is also superb, with distinct dialogue and a soundtrack that soars.  Thank you, Sony, for doing justice to this remarkable film.<br /><br />If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is totally worth it.  This is one of the best blu-ray transfers I have seen of an old classic.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|interesting story line. it keeps u interested to complete each level. love Mr foggy. gets your brain working how to figure. each level!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I haven't read the books, so I can't comment on how it may diverge from the original source material, however I enjoyed the Second season as much as the First. I watched some episodes on Blu-ray and some on DVD since I was not always able to watch on a Blu-ray player. Either media was great to watch. I believe all the extras are on the Blu-ray discs which makes sense and I also can't comment on the Digital copy since I haven't done anything about it. I got it at a $29.99 on Amazon and very happy I bought it when I did.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|I enjoyed and truly liked Cathy, the main character.  I could also understand her OCD because this helped her feel better safe than sorry.  Her instincts and perceptions were correct in dealing with Lee.  It goes to show that we need to listen with an open mind to people who are in her situation!  What a great read!
B000001FKY|5.0|Since I couldn't get the original album as a digital download on iTunes. I decided to get the CD. I believe the band is rerecording the songs. I had the original album, but lent it to someone and never got it back, so I wanted to get the same thing.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|I enjoyed the cartoon as a grown up but would not allow younger children to view.  Good storyline. I would buy it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A must read for any American! After all we only spent 10 years trying to get this guy. I'm glad I know how it all went down.
B0060D11OU|5.0|Mary Poppins is truly a Disney classic...  With a fabulous story to tell - and the best actors ever telling the story..  A movie for anybody..  and everybody!!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love Dawn French and she is great in this too, all the characters are perfect for their roles.<br />If you like period drama's this one is for you!
B000N5F6PG|5.0|Who doesn't love Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore..  with a splash of Whoopi Goldberg...  wonderful movie- romantic, suspenseful...  A poignant love story...
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Ideal tool to keep my pocket knifes razor sharp and it works great on serrated edges.  Keeps blades razor sharp with a minimum amount of work and is lite to carry!
B003IKMR0U|3.0|I'm just leaving this review for people who are wondering about the quality of the zombie cup. I thought it would be cool to have a zombie dice cup and the game seemed fun so I bought this. Unfortunately the cup is a toilet paper roll with a glossy sheet of paper glued to it. It would never hold up like a real dice cup. The art is already tearing off after 30 minutes of playing. Fun game though, I was just hoping for a cup I could use for other games.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn has done written another great book about black opps and terrorism. I never could understand the complexities of the political situation in Packistan. After reading The Last Man, I know a little more. This book is a pager turner.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|How can you go wrong with this movie.Watching it in color makes it even better. A holiday tradition to come in my family.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a fantastic app. It has become part of my daily routine. In combination with the Fujitsu scansnap it becomes a means to a paper free office.
B00006674X|3.0|Its a great story but doesn't have the same feel as the movies that proceeded it. Very much a social comentiary.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Clever romantic comedy with truths that stay true at all times. Anyone can watch this movie. The comedies today cannot stand up against it. We enjoyed it very much.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|This was one of the best games I've played so far.Certainly worth the price in fun,interest and length of game.I used the &#34;Casual&#34; setting and had a great time going through the different tasks with no glitches noted.Would I recommend this game to another?? You betcha!!
B00BP29SAA|5.0|This game is great! Excellent graphics and like all of Dr.Pandas apps interactive and keeps my little one busy on our morning commute.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love it but all the waiting you have to do while an egg is hatching or a dragon is evolving
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The following is not a review but just my humble opinion and nothing more. Beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder. Aside from Judy Dench the movie was boring. As for Javier Bardem's performance seemed to me to not fit in the movie, as his concept of a Bond bad guy was too well acted, too sincere. Of course, Javier is not capable of doing less. The movie made a billion dollars. Great. I love to see a movie succeed. We need to move onto to another incarnation of Bond. Daniel Craig is also a fine actor and needs to move onto other things.<br />I am not being a sour apple here for the sake of being a sour apple. I didn't like the movie, starting with that awful, in my opinion, opening song Skyfall. Talk about insipid lyrics. Where is Shirley Bassey and Goldfinger. Now that was a song sung by a great singer.<br />The only reason I give 3 stars is that there have been worse Bond movies.<br />Yet, the ending of this movie gave me hope that a return to the real 007 universe may be in the cards.<br />So, as one who has seen every 007 film, this was entertaining but disappointing.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|again i want it to be able to view it again at my convience. I also wanted it as part of my collection.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|This movie was cute. For a society that is regressing to childhood, the movie fit the bill as capable of holding a child's attention through frenetic motion. I watched it with my grand kid. We both fell asleep. Forcing me to watch it several more times so the child could see it through. I have to say it was cute. The production values not the best but good.
B000FIMG68|4.0|because I thought the show was great and I want to be able to watch it again and again at my conviece
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|What an original, mesmerizing film. If you want to be twisted back and forth between what is morally right and heroism, this is the film to watch! It is excellent! I watched it three times! Gets even better the second and third time! I am still thinking about this film a week later.
0061801313|5.0|Started to read it but haven't really finished reading all the books. Don't have time right now really busy time in life. I hope to get to read them soon.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Great film! Keeps you interested from beginning to end! When you think you have it all figured out you are shocked with a meaningful twist.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Considering how much I rely on reviewsto ppick what I  down load, this is my first review of a game. Just the perfect twist on a fun old game!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Liked the film, loved all the historical information and it kept me on the edge of my seat. But I really didn't think about this film much after I finished it. In my opinion, a film that is worthy of an Oscar must be a film I would want to watch again. Flight and Life of Pie were much more deserving.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm ready for the next book.  It's going to be a great one!  I've not heard about the next book, but I can't wait!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I put this on my Kindle Fire for my 6 year old granddaughter. She loved it and quickly became addicted to it and went through all the levels and found most of the puzzle pieces. After about 2-3 months, she got tired of it and rarely runs it anymore.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Great mix between science fiction and semi western; more realistic than any other show I've watched.  This is what I would imagine the future would be like.  Very good acting as well.
1416549447|5.0|This book contains excellent tips about running without injury. It takes the basics and explains them very well, with specific activities to improve running form.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Emotional it's amazing. Love it! I've read it multiple times. I've laughed and cried every time. Colleen Hoover  is an amazing  writer  it's defiantly a must read.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|A fantastic Halloween movie. A great classic that never fails to amuse or put me in the holiday spirit. Great
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|absolutly phenomenal album. from start to finish, nothing disapoints. i'd have to say it's not only clutch's best album but possibly one of the best albums i've ever heard. it's the first album in a long time that every single song is BAD ASS! i got to see them perform some of these songs at the end of the world show in denver this last december. awesome. it had to be the best set i've heard them play in the eight shows of thier's i've seen.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I got the Yahoo Mail again because somebody hacked into my last account and I had to set up a new account.  Iliked the last account so I set up the new account.
B00846REIS|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! Got pulled into it right away and simply could not put it down. Very easy to actually immerse yourself in the story and get caught up in the characters
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I loved how the plot line of this movie gave more substance to the other Bourne movies. Though the chase and fight scenes seemed to get a little long, it still was a fun movie to watch. Especially since there were no unnecessary romance or sex scenes. It's definitely fun to watch for those who have seen all the other Bourne movies.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Love this a lot! I need HBO so I don't have to wait til next year for season three. Love this series
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Wow, I am in awe of this series and already an avid fan. Can't wait for the third season to start at the end of this month. Once constructive feedback is that I would like seasons to be longer (each dvd only contained 2 episodes).
0679809015|5.0|Very small, but perfect for small hands, very cute and kind of takes me back to the books I used to read as a child because of the pictures ;)
B001FB4W0W|3.0|It is an ok series which is centered on the vampire theme with story plot revolving around a vampire lair located in New Orleans.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I read the books by Martin after watching season one. I watched season two live after subscribing to HBO for the first time in 15 years. I just watched seasons one and two to prepare for season three beginning on March 31.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|It was a good book and good character people who are in the that are funny and even on the beach
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I found this book more disturbing than most books I have read. I can't say I liked it but it was okay with a little different twist to the theory.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone.  I missed the first two seasons so wanted to see it from the beginning.
B003EYVXTG|3.0|Great movie. Only got to watch it once though, second time it would not play. I would like it replaced.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is really good and very fun to play on specially if you want a horse. Has some amazing features realistic video
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I've been hearing of this show for some time and finally decided to sit down and watch it and I am hooked! Can't wait to see what the Doctor gets up to next.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It will make you laugh and cry and ruin your life with how perfect it is. You have been warned. READ IT.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|I've been a big Clutch fan ever since I was introduced to Elephant Riders long ago.  Earth Rocker is up there with Clutch's very best: Elephant Riders, Pure Rock Fury, Blast Tyrant.  Clutch's last couple of albums left me a little ho-hum, but now I'm hooked all over again.
B008PZ69T8|4.0|Chose this book because of all the hype surrounding it.  Have not finished it yet but so far is like she is living a dream.  Good looking, rich, deranged..... who could ask for more.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|I love these films shot by Ron Fricke with their original, non-verbal approach. Like Baraka before it, Samsara offers the viewer stunningly mesmerizing images edited by Fricke and producer Mark Magidson to an enthralling music score by Michael Stearns weave a magical viewing experience that actually leaves me speechless. Much like a real-life experience, Samsara requires a period of contemplative mental digestion to come up with an explanation of the film's theme, or more correctly, its multiple themes. I found Samsara to be an inspiringly spiritual but realistic view of the contemporary human condition of those living on our beautifully diverse, but fragile planet.<br />My wife and I first screened this film at a theater equipped with a digital projector, and the Blu-ray quality of this particular release looses nothing from our original theater experience.<br />I would recommend Samsara to anyone who wants a memorable sensory experience which is more than just entertaining. The phenomenal photographic mastery of Mr. Fricke weaves dream-like images of our world which I would call extra-ordinary.  Believe me, you've never seen anything like Samsara, unless you are already a fan of Fricke, Magidson and Stearns.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Very talented.  Their classical background in music shows.  I love it. Would recommend to anyone who likes music that is new.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I read this book before the movie came out.  It is so much better than the movie.  If you like the movie, read this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game SUBWAY SURFERS's  is a good and educational game for children!!!!!:)  $ex offenders and things that people believe I'm!!
B006OITIQE|5.0|I saw them on Saturday Night Live.  I wanted to listen to what else they had.  I like every song on this CD.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It is a good game for kids and adults because this is a shark life and it teach kids and some adults about sharks
B000JMLFLW|4.0|This is a great book so far, I haven't finished reading it yet.  I have seen the movie a dozen times and needed to finally read the book.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|This product **** i cant hear my own voice and my computer cant even see if i speak or not, to Avoid!!!!
B0045DO8NI|5.0|This is a great CD/DVD combo set.  The DVD has some videos on there that I had never seen.  The CD is also great.  Pink is a great artist.
0307730697|5.0|I read this in one sitting today...and loved every minute of it. I can write no higher recommendation about any book, nor life testimonial, than this. This story is truly transformational.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a great trilogy.  I read it faster than any other book series before.  If you like the movies, then read these books.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|the clock is handsome the alarms are soothing and I am greatful for this free app.  why didn't I get this for the Kindle before!
6304711905|4.0|Wonderful movie.  This is one of my stepdad's favorites.  I bought it for him for his birthday.  A must for any movie collector.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great, realistic, compelling characters. Action packed, funny, sad stories all mixed and rolled together. It's kind of comparable to the series &#34;24&#34; -- once you start watching, you can't quit it.
B000BCE918|5.0|This is a great box set.  The movie case opens from the front instead of the side which looks like the gates of Jurassic Park opening.  This is a must for any movie collector.
0812984412|5.0|It takes a long time to read and digest this complex novel but it is well worth the time and effort.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is amazing and just keeps getting better! We don't have cable, so I couldn't live without it on amazon!! Gotta get my next day fix!
B004F1F32A|5.0|This movie was a great movie!  It kept us on the edge of our seats from beginning of the movie to end.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|The whole family sat down to watch this This one was good. It had a story to it to help figure out and kept us on edge most of the movie.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Did not know much about the movie, but read the good reviews on Amazon.  My wife and i both enjoyed this movie.
B004EWFUQY|4.0|This book is great. It tells you all you need to know to go on thier diet. Follow the book and it willwork.
B004SIP7NU|5.0|Wonderful acting - great insight into the writing of Peter Pan. Excellent source for a critical understanding of Barrie's work.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|I saw it because the first one wasn't awful and I am a huge fan of the game series. The plot, the acting, the special effects everything was pretty terrible. I never liked the third Silent Hill as much as the others, which was used for this movie, but this movie takes a mediocre game and makes it awful. Don't bother watching,
B0063IH60K|2.0|It's okay but I wanted something better. I will look for another one. Nothing much else to say about it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game and very realistic. I would recommend everyone try this game. I love this game its because I am an animal lover.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I love Mahjongg games but this is not a version I really like. I guess I will have to try another.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Such an amazing book! I could not put it down, and such tragedy little ones have to go through, so unique and special!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|We will see as things progress. I haven't used it yet so I don't know if it meets my needs.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game on the ipod a lot but it wont let me download it on the kindle fire!?!?!?!
B004SDEP38|5.0|I downloaded a different tool to read my spreadsheets created on my laptop. The other tool screwed up the formulas. This one read them perfectly. I've only used the spreadsheet part so far.
B00BLCHZC2|2.0|This was boring to watch. The plot doesn't move and nothing much is going on. Things are pretty obvious and you can expect what will happen next
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have a facebook account but rarely use it. I don't care for social media sites. I think they are built to take advantage of people. To many security holes. People spend too much time on these things and say things about themselves and family they shouldn't.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|The series is 4 seasons long, so a worthy review is difficult to compose.  Try the first season and you'll be convinced by the performances and period details, for sure.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It's an OK tool to check battery usage. They are all the same and this one was free so I downloaded it and it did what I needed.
B009HEMW4W|3.0|I liked that this movie gave a bit of background information to the Men in Black series. It explained a couple of questions I had from the first movie but I don't want to spoil it for others so I won't elaborate. Unfortunately it didn't have the &#34;something&#34; of the first two movies.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I needed a calculator tool and this one was free so I downloaded it. Not much else to say. It does the job.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I have always enjoyed this show and Season 5 has continued to exceed my expectations. Excellent storyline and great dialog. In real life there isn't always a happy ending. The writers of this show showed how when there isn't a happy ending, there is &#34;I'll take what I can get&#34; endings. I look forward to the rest of the season.
B007FIY3VW|3.0|I bought this hoping it would read my excel spreadsheets. It does read them but fails to allow for certain formulas. I got another tool Documents to Go which does a better job.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|If you can overlook the unbelievable coincidences and enjoy this movie for what it is, a fun reintroduction of the original Star Trek characters, you'll be in for a wild and exciting ride.
B005MLP71Y|1.0|It got really popular on Tumblr and I thought it would be one of those movies that's good because it was making fun of itself but it was so bad. It was so bad it makes me angry. Seriously don't waste your time.
B003EYVY0E|4.0|The movie itself is great.  The only thing I knock it down a star for is not having an extended edition of the movie.  All the other extras that are included are great.  The documentary series that runs throughout the course of the ultimate editions gives a great behind the scenes look at the series as a whole, then there are a lot of features that are just specific to this movie.  One of the best parts of the first two UE sets was the option of seeing the extended edition (which essentially just incorporated the deleted scenes into the movie).  You do get the deleted scenes here, but they do now flow as well just seeing them one after another.  That is the only drawback.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it is great.  By this time you kind of know how the movies flow as opposed to the books, and just expect that a lot is going to be cut from the books to make the movie.  While it took some getting used to in the first couple movies, I found it to be far less of an issue at this point.  The story introduces three characters that are essential to the rest of the story.  Sirius Black, Lupin, and Wormtail.  Neither of which are what they initially seem to be. Lupin gets the most screen time, and is great as the favorite teacher that takes Harry under his wing to start to prepare him for what lies ahead.  The story continues getting darker and the characters are put in more and more peril.  It is the film where the shift from introducing the world and the characters to getting to the meat of the Harry vs. Voldemort story begins.<br /><br />The big change in this movie is the addition of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore.  Richard Harris died after making the second movie, and it does take some getting used to.  Gambon plays a far less soft spoken and more eccentric version of Dumbledore.  When I first saw the movie I did not like his version as much, but after this film you get used to him more, and his presence feels more natural by the end of the series.<br /><br />The lack of an extended version of the film aside, the movie is great, and the extras are very good.  If you can find this for the right price, it is worth adding to your collection.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|Its a fun game but it takes forever to download so I recommend it but there's just that one issue
B0049J3RBC|5.0|Easily my favorite movie from Pixar, and quickly becoming my son's, now calling himself the &#34;Tiny Chef.&#34;  Adding three words.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just really like this app. It is easy to use and fun to play. I would recommend this to friends and family
B004LWZWBU|5.0|If you're a birder or know a birder you'll relate to this movie.  The combination of comedians makes this movie a plus too.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Love this show.  Everything from characters, sets,  to production are outstanding.  The plot twists are riveting,  if I didn't own a TV I'd buy one to watch this lol.
B000ZM1FXO|1.0|terrible acting, soft porn is all it is, not even good looking people either. Better to watch weeds grow taller.
0345525558|3.0|I read this book in one sitting,  you would think that would mean I liked it.  Not so much, mysteries compel me even when the plot and characters let me down.  The heroine has a narcissistic personality disorder and is borderline sociopathic in that she seems to lack empathy.  She cannot see past her own feelings to emphasize with others.  She has had a rough start to life and in the whole nature/nurture environment the author is firmly on the side of nurture.  She comes across an assortment of people who are only found in books, as they are so generous with resources and forgiveness they don't exist outside of Mother Teresa stereotypes.  To call the plot contrived would be complimentary.  I actually felt a little unwell when I finished this pap.  YMMV.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is an ok app.  I find the wide variety of games nice.  Though I wish they would be more creative.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I so wanted to love this book. I LOVED Delirium and Pandemonium. I have read them both several times and recommended them to friends. I found them unique, excellent writing, romantic, and great dystopian fiction. However, I have to say that since Lauren Oliver has made it clear that she is ending this series with this book, I was hugely disappointed with the ending. We don't really know what happens to this world or most of the characters in the end. I despise when authors do this. They make us love their characters, and then they leave us with this ambiguous ending? I need more closure than this! Especially if you are going to write dystopian fiction- tell us how it ends!!! I also did not find this book at all romantic compared to what the other two were like. Alex was amazing and so emotional in the first book and despite loving him, I was drawn into Julian's story in Pandemonium. While I could understand Lena's emotions and the difficulty she was faced with, the ending and her choice I found anticlimactic. Requiem was not what I was waiting and hoping for.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very good read. Nicholas Sparks with a dark twist. Held your interest and kept you wanting to read more. I would recommend.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|A Storm of Swords is really a great book. And the book have one of the biggist &#34;Oh my god&#34; moments that really set the standart for the series. Defently the best of the books so far!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I cant put it down, its horrible, like Tetris and crack, you will spend hours of your life killing pigs.
B004P1JEXE|4.0|A Fast for Crows itsnt the bedst book in the series. But if you alrighty have read the other books then you have to read this one too. It was still entertaining and keept me reading.
076790592X|1.0|After all the hype over the years I finally got around to this book.  And seriously, it was quite a disappointment.  Yes, it's poignant in parts, but Mitch is not a great writer and it is solely Morrie's insights that carry the book to the bank.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I think I liked the first one better.  Now I have seen the movie and read the first two in the series.  I enjoy them.<br />This one seemed a little slow at times and a bit more contrived.  You have to have contrived plots to make this formula work, but maybe too much  here.
B005LAII8K|5.0|I thought this movie was wonderful. I saw this in theaters before I bought it and have been waiting for it to come out.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|Completed every puzzle available. Very easy to pick up and play. Once I started I couldn't stop. Wish there was more.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|I liked it a lot, good actors for sure! I would certainly watch this again. I also got a another for a gift.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Great movie for the whole family.  Has plenty of modern game references for kids, and the 8-bit cabinets for those who grew up in an arcade!
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is the best out of the three Daniel Craig Bond movies I think. There was a bits of humor that I loved!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked the way that his first wife seemed to have a part in the his choice for a second wife.  I also liked the way this story addressed spouse abuse.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I purchased this along with the electrical plug after accidentally leaving the one that came with it at the hospital.  I actually feel this one worked better then the one that initially came with my kindle fire.  It seems the connection wasn't as loose and actually charged faster/better.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this series!  The characters are great and so are the actors!!  Daryl is my favorite!!  Love Ric, too!
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|I first viewed these episodes on first run in the 60s.  Great to see them again. Brings back fond memories of the time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read various articles about near death experiences and a couple of books (\\"90 Minutes in Heaven,\\" \\"Heaven is for Real,\\" and find it fascinating that they have commonalities with each other.<br /><br />I am a non-denominational Christian and find comfort in reading the Bible and talking about Christ to others.  Much of my faith has been derived from experiences like the author's story, but not on a \\"near death experience\\" level.  I know that God is always with me and relish in his spirit when I feel him \\"speaking\\" to me on a level that I don't quite understand.<br /><br />It is obvious that Dr. Alexander is a very intelligent, accomplished neurosurgeon and I found the medical terminology somewhat difficult to grasp.  But that did not prevent me from understanding his story.<br /><br />He begins by describing the bacteria that attacked his body and the experiences while meeting God in heaven.  He describes it in as much detail as he can muster but finds that our language prevents him from describing it in full.  Next, he goes into details about what heaven and God are like - where love is a dominating force - and describes his physical, emotional and mental experiences.  Finally, he writes about his return to earth and how he ended up sharing his story with others.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for both believers and non-believers who are \\"on the fence\\" about whether there is a higher power.  It is a quick and fascinating read.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This book has been around for years and now my granddaughter loves it and &#34;reads&#34; the book to us enthusiastically.
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|My husband and I watched this when we were growing up, and now our son is watching it and he loves it.  We forgot some of the funny things that happened with the A-Team. Obviously the movie is different then the actual t.v. show episodes.  But we found the original seasons of the A-Team on Netflix and our son is watching them all.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I choose this rating because I really just love this program.  It is interesting and very well done.  Most of the TV now is all about sex and violance.  The writers of this have used the era and the history to portrate these characters in a well rounded way.  I believe everyone would enjoy watching this because it is very well done.
B00881VLCE|5.0|No probles with the app except for annoying  advertisements. Plenty of free puzzless to do. Use the pieces scrambled to make it more interesting
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I think this is just the most enjoyable series out at this time.  Most of the TV  now is almost all about sex and violence.  This is about interesting people and times.  I feel this would be interesting for anyone.  I will recomend this to all.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I decided to try this as an experiment. Without really trying i lost 4 kilos in 4 weeks. I still miss a nice croissant or a vienese bun, though!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome show I love love love it! Why is there a required number of words? I think that is horrible, let me review something with as many words as I want.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BUTTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Minecraft is so fricking awesome! But they should put wolves,emerald,nether,and villages. But great game. Mojang,your awesome! And who says pixels are ugly? Minecraft is da bomb of pixels!
B005ZUR724|5.0|awesome. finally an mmorpg thats mobile. too many things you need to pay money for. plhoping they make some things free
B00BLGDFH2|5.0|I never was a time I had to get a album.... this is the one. I wanted to own the album -vs- to see if there was anything on Pandora
1451696191|5.0|I am in love with this book. It is a great coming-of-age story, characters are relatable, and it's a quick read. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fresh read about teenage life. Also love the size of the book, paperback is great and the book isn't too heavy to read in bed when tired.
1594203334|4.0|As other reviewers have mentioned, this book is a story about a young Ex-pat family's life in Paris and not a \\"how-to\\" manual. It is a quick read and very entertaining. It may be helpful for those who are struggling with the current \\"American way\\" of raising children, or those with a lack of common sense. :) I enjoyed the book, but I was a little disappointed that Druckerman generalizes that all American kids are terrors and their parents are miserable.<br /><br />I found that many of the \\"Pearls of French Child Raising Wisdom\\" mentioned in the book echo what I have learned from my very Southern Grandmothers (ages 85+). It makes me wonder, are these ideas truly French, or simply more old fashioned? Are the issues we are having today with raising children more of a generational issue than simply an American one? Maybe we should not only listen to other cultures when trying to improve American parenting, but also to our own mothers and grandmothers that were successful at balancing kids and life?
B007YOC4RW|5.0|If you like blues and rock, then this is for you. It is my first time listening to Joe and I am impressed. One of my favorites now.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Thanks for sending it so fast and just loved the price. I really got this one for my son, I  love the first one the most.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Personal preference here im sure. Just Ok movie to me but rest of the family really enjoyed it. Price was right.
B006N9XHLQ|5.0|I have loved reading all about Adrien English and I'm hoping Josh Lanyon keeps the series going.  There has to be more to explore with him and Jake!  Plus, I would love to see what happens with Adrien's new family..Lauren, Natalie, and Emma.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|How old are your kids? Well this might have been our kids favorite gift this year. They know the thing by heart already.
B000WCBMA8|5.0|The Hives are IT, everything every bunch of wannabees strive for; driving, pounding, relentless, hardcore punk/garage band tunes, so catchy you find yourself desperately trying to get them out of your head, days after listening to or seeing them live. (Which is THE ULTIMATE rock and roll experience!) They don't disappoint album after album. No wimpy slow tunes, no soppy lyrics, just cleverly written, reminiscent of a great band like Sparks, way back from the 70's. Beginning with Tick Tick Boom, it's all uphill from there. LOVE THIS BAND!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Most depressing 'comedy' I've ever seen.It is terrible.This is surprising given the cast of Paul Rudd and the rest who normally give a great performance.Who wrote this piece of garbage and who it  put on the screen? This is not 40.I've been there and it is nothing as bad as this unless you live in Afghanistan.Maybe not even then.This is not even close to funny and a waste of time and money.One unrealistically depressing scene after another.If anyone is thinking about suicide don't let them watch this because they'll do it for sure.Just watch 40 year old virgin again  or knocked up.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Yes this is yet another page turner from E.L. James, and Yes I would highly recommend all three of these books to any one who likes to read, and yet again it had to end. looking forward to her next book to come out, because I know it will be another page turner as well.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The plot was not at all what I expected. It was was full of interesting surprises, not predictable like many other novels. I look forward to seeing the move now.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book enormosly, just as good if not better than book 1, I would highly recommend this book as well as the first one. the only thing that I didn't like about this book is that it had to end.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|It was a good book, a woman trapped in a relationship with an abusive partner. This book goes into detail how difficult it is to leave. I would recommend this to anyone. It gets a bit tricky with the story line but otherwise good story
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This has got to be the most incredible books I have ever read. It totally consumed my life. I just couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read period, even if you don't like romance novels, you  will absolutely love this book. It is very entertaining to say the least, very hot and very sexy. You will love it!!!!!
B00BF11STU|1.0|I watched the whole movie from start to end , pulled the movie out of the player , and threw it straight in the trash!
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Did the job I needed it for. Helps let's you watch flash on certain tablets that usually can't play flash.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Could have done with some serious pruning. I appreciate the sentiment of this quirky film, which straddled the line between forthright acting and modern snark driven movie improv comedy, but man did it need some editing. Don't know if Apatow just didn't want to lose so much of the painfully obvious improv scenes (some of them real clunkers), or couldn't find it in his heart to cut lines for his wife and daughters, but it could have been more efficient, and thereby more funny and effecting. Certainly didn't need to be over two hours. By the end, I just wasn't caring as much about them as a couple as I was at the beginning of the film, or wanted to as an audience member. That he was running a record label and seemed overtly incompetent or unaware of trends in the industry to the point of ignorance seemed a little much. Overall not a bad movie, just not really sure what it accomplished except a snapshot of an average dysfunctional white upper middle class American family circa the early 21st century. If you're not already living it, or are interested in that kind of thing with some decent laughter, it's worth your $5 and a night in on the couch, but not much more.
B00A9X9VAI|2.0|JGL does a pretty good job, Bruce Willis, not so much. Too many contrived and poorly executed components here. Drags and drags to the point that this could have been 1:20 and not 1:58. Do not waste your time or money. And that goes for when it's free on Netflix or something else, this is just a disaster - like someone put it together on the back of a napkin, and filmed it all in a week or two.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I could not put it down!  Well written and very suspenseful!<br />I highly recommend this captivating work of fiction that feels like true crime!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've read a lot of good books this year but this is far my favourite! It reminds me of Barely Breathing. It is a powerful book. Thank you Colleen
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|It amazes me how game creators come up with these ideas, but this one is so imaginative and truly a work of art!<br />You are in space and an organism that must absorb everything else -- each level is unique and we are<br />Talking about a multimedia experience that has to be experienced!
B007N6NGYG|1.0|it doesn't even go past level 5 for me. I don't know if its bad luck but to me its not fun at all.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|This is one of those puzzle apps where you have to get the test tubes to make the crazy formula.<br />It starts out easy and gets harder...truly another clever and wonderful game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good book; well written and engaging.  Characters and story line excellent.  Well developed plot and engaging dialogue.  A book that is difficult to put down.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Couldn't put it down. Read all three books in a week or so. Very good book to read which there was one more book
B00BMUYLSE|3.0|Nothing too interesting here, just some indistinguishable songs and one very nice ballad.  I wish it contained more of the latter.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|The colors are bright and the music is fun.  It's easy to play and makes a good time-passer.  I like making my own aquarium scenes too.  I don't like some of the decorations but you can change them if you like or not use them at all and I would like a better variety of fish.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|This was a well- written book that held my interest with plot twists right up to the end.  The novel explored the relationships between mother and daughter and husband and wife.  It was plausible, but a bit in the paranormal range.  Good value for the money.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|This was a rental by my wife - I did watch it with her but it was not my cup of tea - - I found the movie plot slow, however my wife liked it.
0316056871|5.0|I always liked Tina Fey from SNL and 30Rock but after reading her book, I admire her. I will admit that i didn't fully understand her humor until after taking a comedy improv class. But once I understood comedy improv, the more I see Ms. T. Fey as very talented, imaginative, professional, and creative. I very much enjoy reading about the stories that make up her life and feel inspired to see life through her eyes. This book is a quick read but I look forward to it on my commute every single day. On days i don't want to go to work, I just think &#34;I get to read Bossypants&#34; on the train which cheers me up for the most part. Thanks Tina Fey for entertaining me for the past few weeks and giving my life something to live for each day, haha. &#60;3
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Good but not great - - I would have been disappointed if I had paid the admission fee at a theater. Appears to be more of a children's movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What a mind blowing game only if it was a little bit more challenging then it would be the best game in the world  :) ! :) !
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Lots of action and special effects - mot a great movie but entertaining. This is a guy movie as it should be. Don't expect to see this movie win any Academy Awards.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|Love the color love the cover. Does the job of protecting my kindle fire. The orange color helps me find it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|What can I say? Beautiful high-quality images. Brings back the original experience of the 1st theatrical viewings. The extras are extensive.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It is nice to hear know that even the most educated can learn from the heavens. I would have enjoyed even more of the story of his adventure while in the coma. that part was fascinating. I am happy to know he had the courage to share this information.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Lots of fun! Wish I won more often but still enjoy playing! Playing 2 or more cards at the same time is really a challenge but so worth it! BINGO!!
B004S9AK3G|5.0|Ken Follett has a fantastic gift for story telling.  I have found all his books that I have read captivating and difficult to put down once started.  I am a great fan unfortunately he can't write as fast as we can read.So I anxiously await his next release
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love this series and I was immediately hooked the first episode, however I feel that lately the story has been less about survival against zombies and more about the soap opera between the living. I do feel that this adds realism but lately it seems they throw in one or two zombies to fillet almost absentmindedly while discussing sports or something. I don't feel the fear like I did in season 1 & 2 which is why I deducted a star, but the acting continues to be superb and gripping and the writers continue to make you root for your favorite heroes. Obviously if you have made it this far in the series you are already a fan. Enjoy! Keep killing those zombies!.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|Enjoyed the ongoing journey of all characters. Iam about to commence the 3rd Chronicle. Hope Jeffrey Archer gets moving on books 4 and 5. Most enjoyable
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how easy it is to use on my ipad or iphone. Great.and easy to use in church or Bible Study. Easy navigation.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great basic calculator. som reviewers stated it only has +,-,&divide;,x. if you swipe the memory keys, you&acute;ll find a few more functions (pi, x&sup2;, root, 1/x)
0345529057|5.0|Couldn't find book 4 in Las Vegas for the life of me. Glad i got the set though, much better deal.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Joss Whedon is a genius, this is one of the best series ever. I have watched every episode many times and never get tired of it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was hooked on this series instantly. I loved the entire thing. I would highly recommend it to my friends.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|A fun story that takes place within the world behind the video screens of an arcade. The characters are pretty well defined and I think a child would enjoy it. I found it entertaining without an overload of visual stimuli. There are some adult oriented humorous points that adults will find enjoyable beyond the storyline.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|good way to pass a rainy day. can be very addictive and holds your attention for an hour or so.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|The story idea is interesting and its cool to see how the mythical beings for the days of yore are shown in todays light.<br />This may help to educate children on the existence of these stories, if they never heard of them.<br />The villain, though, is a bit too predictable and I think they could have refined him.<br />Adults will find some hidden adult humor in the story too.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|This purchase was a gift and hasn't been opened yet. These movies are favorites of my dad so that is why I bought the set for his birthday.<br /><br />I was very satisfied with how quickly they were delivered.
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|using this will help you mange apps that may be open in the background and eat up battery life by using unneeded facilities of your device and it saves available battery life by shutting them down. I prefer non ad apps, so I chose this one.
B0068THAGY|5.0|Knew it would have all of the Spielberg touches as he produced it. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though it was very similar to ET. The only difference is the alien did not have the cuteness that ET had. But, it was a good story, good effects, good acting and it kept my attention. Good for the whole family, though there are some scary, dark moments.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I really enjoyed both the first and second seasons of this.  Once I started watching, I couldn't stop!  It is an interesting murder mystery type show.  It does have some inappropriate context that one might want to be careful of if you let your youngster watch it as a high school student dates her teacher.  It also has a girl who figures out that she is gay and comes out to her family.  I wouldn't suggest this for anyone younger than 13 and even then it would depend on how you as a parent feel about some of the issues.  The current season on TV however has gotten boring.  They push the &#34;A&#34; thing too far and I feel the first 2 seasons are great but season 3 is not that good.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This guy can write.  A fantastic, funny book.  I read a lot of science fiction, this was an easy, fun, immaginative read.  One of the best I've read in a long time.  I even told my wife to read it, and she hates science fiction.  I don't think she willread it,  her loss.<br /><br />In many of the science fiction books I have read, the protagonist is unrealistic or boring.  Not here.  You really like, and admire the guy.  I will miss him.<br /><br />PS- this is the first review I have ever written.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|This calculator does all of the basic functions needed in a typical day.  It even has some of the more complex functions for students.
B00AHGSVKS|3.0|I was happy that I read Childhood's End as it is a classic bit of science fiction. Nonetheless, there isn't a character hook to the story, and hence not much of a modern story line. Much of the book is Clarke's speculations of how humans would react upon arrival on Earth of a superior intelligence. While that is interesting, it would be much better if he had made us care about the characters having to deal with the aliens and change.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very good first hand account. Definitely worthy of praise. Thankful for our soldiers for keeping us safe and out of harms way
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Ms. Goodwin regales us with the lives of Lincoln's contemporaries and shows us his superiority to them all. An excellent read as are all her books.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe is a great show. The season gets better a few episodes into the season. Seasons two and three get really intense.
1847946240|5.0|Duhigg shows us how habits develop and then how they are used to further self interest, business, and other aspects of life. I was intrigued by his examples from football, Starbucks, Alcoa and other places. I really enjoyed reading this book.
0312427646|1.0|I just do not like the author or his style.  Have read others and didnt like them either.  Sorry. but you asked!
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I bought this app I loved it!!!and the first thing I built was a mansion!!! Buy this game!!!!then my sister Sophie joined my game then my sister Sophie destroyed my home. So buy this app!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was a book being read and discussed by a book club in a nearby library. I saw the notice and thought the title was interesting. When I read the blurb, I knew I had to read the book.  Having read much about WWII--both fiction and nonfiction--I must say that few books have touched me so profoundly as The Book Thief. The unusual perspective of the narrator is very effective as is the unfolding of events as they affected a little German girl, her family, and her peers in a small German town. An excellent book!
B00BNNJHXO|5.0|My favorite collection of Soilwork albums thus far.  \\"Spectrum of Eternity\\" and \\"Whispers and Lights\\" are probably my favorites.  The intense melodies and harmonies are superb.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|woohooo! perfect, love that you can access your notes, even when not connected to wifi, only flaw is that you have toopen the app to sync your notes
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I bought this based on the first single, which I normally wouldn't do, but after hearing an interview on Sirius and listening to her sing a couple of other songs live in the studio, I took the risk.  Wasn't a risk at all.  There are other songs on the album I like even more, and top to bottom, there's nothing that I skip.  I've bought a few other albums recently, but this is the one I tend to keep coming back to most.  It has a nice blend of upbeat pop songs, ballads, and all are lyrically well written.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love the background on this game and there are more things you can do  besides just run. I think  this is a game adults and children will enjoy
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I didn't expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did. It was a great movie. I wish I had seen it at the theater.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|So, this book wasn't as exciting as the first two books. Nevertheless, i continues hoping that the end would be the best part. I didn't like how the ending was summarized. The wedding, the children and how the mockingjay felt going through all this.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love to play during long flight! Crew favorite! Wish there was another land to play in. Lots of fun with each new turn.
1476712042|5.0|Excellent book, Jamie McQuire is a wonderful author. I couldnt hardly put the book down. Now waiting on Walking Disaster.
B007712XAU|5.0|absolutely love it! I loved the castle, it's gorgeous... the characters are wonderful too! the storyline is so interesting...I can't wait to see the  next episode!
B004LUS390|5.0|I love drawing so much and would love to be an artist when I grow old, this app is so easy to use and I just love it!!!
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|I bought this Blu-Ray for hubby and we were riveted throughout. Being married to a former sound man/ drummer I knew he'd appreciate the history of The Neve and the drum-friendly studio along with its Who's Who of recording artists. I just bought a second copy to be sent to our audiophile son and can't wait to talk about it after he's seen the film. Up close and personal, this is a must have for any true music lover. Is there anything Dave Grohl CAN'T do?!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed all the hunger games books, I loved how it pulled me into Tue world where people kill others for fun. I've read many books, and this by far the most exciting and breathe taking book I've ever read. Suzanne Collins is a great author.
B0063GORYU|5.0|So fun, but addictive! It keeps your mind sharp or it's driving you crazy. I'm pretty sure anyone would love it.
6305910103|5.0|If you didn't feel like crying near the end of this movie ( after the INCIDENT in the Engine Room ) , chances are : you are very likely a cold blood psychopath.<br /><br />Sorry , I was not logic.<br /><br />But one can not deny that this is the most HUMAN Star Trek movie ever.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|*****Warning! May contain some spoilers*****<br /><br />Very disappointed with this film, especially from Pixar which has put out some gems. There was no clear moral, a sketchy plot, and minimal resolution.<br /><br />The movie tries to make some vague points about changing your fate, except you can't really change your fate, only sometimes you can. It's very vague has no real purpose.<br /><br />There's also this whole mother/daughter relationship dynamic which could have been done beautifully, and in fact has some good moments, but again: vague and no real purpose.<br /><br />Spoiler alert! After the main character and her mother get in a fight, tearing a tapestry, the daughter finds a witch and asks for her mother to be \\"changed\\". The mother is cursed into becoming a bear. The given solution to the curse is to \\"mend the bond\\" that was broken. You'd think: \\"well clearly it's a metaphor, and the mother/daughter relationship needs mending.\\" Wrong. For some reason the writers decide to take this extremely literally and she has to physically sew the tapestry that was broken.<br /><br />Overall, the film really stretches to find some depth and meaning which at the end of the day just isn't there. Pixar films used to be a \\"must see\\" for me, but \\"brave\\" has me doubting that mentality.
B0094K1WZE|2.0|The MI series has run its course, jumped the shark, or just petered out. Nothing goes right in this film and I'm not just talking about the plot.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|A excellent film, very exciting, nail biting at times, graphic, well portrayed, keeps you guessing right up till the end.
0385349947|2.0|Sandberg seems to think all women are alike. Since she thinks we should get up to the table, here I am. There is more to life in all leagues besides meetings, policy and apex dominance. Women are creating their own version of life, career, family and community.  This is a narrow look at a diverse group.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|One hell of a film..the flight itself kept you on your toes, Denzil played the part so well, highly recommend for everyone to see this film.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Changes the game: sweat proof, ultra lite, and stay on no matter what.  I don't think there's a better pair out there.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Another masterpiece from Joss Whedon. I felt the action, special effects, casting, acting, directing, and story to all be exceptional. The casting of Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was iffy, but I feel he was the best Hulk to date. Compared to Tony Stark/Iron Man, I feel the other heroes could have received more screen time. The story at times felt centered around Tony; it made the movie feel like &#34;Iron Man 2.5,&#34; rather than The Avengers. This will not be a problem except for those who hate Iron Man and/or Tony Stark, and I only have pity on those people who fail to recognize Robert Downey's amazing acting ability.<br /><br />This 4-disc edition in particular was a great bargain. Even if you don't use everything included (digital movie download, I'm looking at you) it's still a good deal.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This entry to the Batman phenom. is one of the best. Great story, easy to follow, and excellent action. I highly recommend it. Light years ahead of Jim Carey's attempt.
B004JK61K0|5.0|K-9 absolutely beats the lame mail app that comes with the kindle giving you full features and control. I especially like that it will download up to 250 messages per account.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Sorry book hardly had any. Redeeming value.  I could have and should have quite after reading  the first half of the book.
B00943SP0G|5.0|The movie was so much fun.  Great music.  Tongue in cheek style.  Brought me back to my youth in the seventies.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|When I read Delirium I was in love. It was so powerful and romantic that when Alex 'died' I cried for the first time in a long time because of a book. I was so in love with the idea of Alex, that anytime Julian was mentioned it honestly pissed me off. So every time there was a Lena and Julian moment in this book I had to grit my teeth and keep from flinging the book across the room. I feel cheated because I waited basically two whole books for Lena and Alex to be reunited and all I was given in return was a quick kiss. To go from the best book I've ever read, Delirium, to almost the worst, Requiem, was a big disappointment.
B00BHU9DUK|3.0|Nothing special.  Stick with the book.  The book was long so the movie had to dramatically (no pun intended) shorten the stories of the characters, especially Levin and Kitty.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|I am a huge bond fan but this was just terrible.  I don't like craig at all.  Craig is not handsome or suave he's just a thug.  I liked all of the other bonds but Craig just doesn't work he's just to old.  I miss the gadgets and were was the bond girl?  I'm glad I got this movie from the library or I would have wanted my money back.  I keep trying to like this new bond but it's not working.  If I could have given this less then 1 star I would have.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|A must have item. Easy to install and use. I'll get another One for m&uacute;ltiple  images catching when riding outdoor
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Since this movie startet (here in Germany) in February i saw this few times in the cinemas and it is my favorite movie for this year. In Addition im happy that is a us-german co-production with produce in many locations there.<br /><br />A great action and fun movie. With funny new ideas, a familar background story, few dramatic scenes and bloody horror. Also the music is great.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner as Hansel (in Germany Hänsel!) and Gemma Arterton as Gretel are absolutly great. They bring the action, fun and the dramatic very good on the screen. That make it to a great movie as a new version from the old fairy-tale story of Hansel&Gretel.<br /><br />The new ideas in this story are great and make it funny too. And it has the potential to a second movie, i hope it soo.<br /><br />I think, that the 90 min. are ok, the movie is not to short and not to long.<br /><br />I have seen it in 2D and 3D in the cinemas, but i think that, 2D is almost better.
B004UPANGM|4.0|Its funny the movie made me laugh more than once cant complain is not that bad just remember its and oldie
B00B1TJO10|5.0|Andy Field's Discovering Statistics books are both enjoyable to read and comprehensive in their coverage of topics. Even those who dislike statistics will find this text engaging and intuitive. For the more ambitious, the book is packed full of references to original research and other literature related to the topics discussed. The most enjoyable aspect of this book is its balance between the ideas of understanding the statistical concepts and of actually performing the analysis. If you aren't interested in the theory, you can skip it and still get practical steps for conducting the analysis. Likewise, if you don't care about SPSS, the book is still valuable for the theory it provides.<br /><br />The only downside to this book is that it is for SPSS, which is incapable of many modern robust tests. But no worries, as Field has also written Discovering Statistics Using R, which provides a larger set of tools.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Great movie, cast, etc... Mae Whitman is great as usual, Emma Watson is totally boneable. Check it out as soon as possible.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I enjoyed the it once again. I had forgotten quite a bit since I last saw the movie. It was like a new movie.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. there are a few glitches but they seem to fix them pretty quick. lots of different levels to complete and they just keep adding more.
B00122RFRQ|5.0|If you love the more melodic compositions of Steve, and prefer the less pop music style (before Phil became completely dominant) you'll love this album.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Awesome movie best renner movie yet would definitely recommend me everyone to watch except for children there is lots of blood and gore parts but great movie
B00BIQU1K4|3.0|Good if you like prog rock. I am more of a Genesis type fan. Great melodic tracks, glad to hear he keeps making new music.
0802473156|5.0|A great “ owners manual “ for any relationship. Be it friend or lover, speak the right language. Thanks Dr Chapman.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game can be summarized into many words but ive got one word that describes it perfectly<br />i typically would think this word isnt very fitting to  the game, but after playing a few<br />rounds i think it will fit perfectly, the word is .......<br />AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I felt it was based on preprosperous situations.  Prolonging the &#34;Kiss&#34; incident was tirersome and boring.  There were many other scenes that were of the same type.  It WAS Hopeless!!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|mindless but not boring<br />I'm gonna keep playing<br /><br />mindless but not boring<br />I like the scenery<br />the cart could go a little slower for beginners<br />I might get discouraged soon
B005T87QCI|5.0|This is an awesome game<br /> I thought it was a fun game I just keep goin through the tournaments 20 70
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This show is funny and sentimental.  Anyone who has ever played a video game will love this show and also those who have not yet.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Overall the book was rushed and still has a lot of unanswered questions. Characters where broken apart with no details of why.
B000001ELR|5.0|I orig. bought this record in December 1982.  In the summer of 2010, I bought this album on CD format. Something about the CD sounded different, but I couldn't figure out why. One thing that I DID notice, FOR SURE, on the CD, was that the 2nd song \\"Saint & Sinner\\", AND the 8th song, \\"Killer\\" were REVERSED on the ORDER of the songs...I DIDN'T like that @ all.<br /> Then come to find that I had bought the 1985 German Import version of this 1982 classic. Two or three songs had been REMIXED. And even the album looked entirely different from what I remembered from 1982. Last week on 3/16/13, I bought the CD AGAIN & I made sure that the album cover AND the song order was correct, the way that I ORIGINALLY remembered it.  I'm gonna do my review of this album now as follows:<br /><br />1.  \\"Creatures Of The Night\\"...I love this EXCELLENT song. It is good & powerful.<br /><br />2.  \\"Saint & Sinner\\"...pretty good song, that I really like quite well.<br /><br />3.  \\"Keep Me Comin' \\"...more of a sexy number here.  It's pretty good & I like it.<br /><br />4.  \\"Rock & Roll Hell\\"...this song is excellent & powerful. I love this song.<br /><br />5.  \\"Danger\\"...pretty good song.<br /><br />6.  \\"I Love It Loud\\"...the hit single, that I remember from the December 1982-January 1983 time frame.  I LOVE the drumming INTRO on this song.  And I forgot to mention, that THIS song is EXCELLENT.<br /><br />7.  \\"I Still Love You\\"...this is a unique, but powerful ballad by Paul. It is very good.<br /><br />8.  \\"Killer\\"...pretty good song.<br /><br />9.  \\"War Machine\\"...I like this song quite well.<br /><br />This 1982 Kiss classic \\"Creatures of the Night\\" was the BEST album , since 1979's \\"Dynasty\\" album.  This Kiss album is most definitely recommended & quite enjoyable.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a great  game. it teaches kids how to be resposable for an animal.esp a horse. 4 stars for sure.
B004I744AS|5.0|I like this app! I can easily type in a word and find the definition.  I was disappointed with the dictionaries (book form) that came on my Kindle Fire H D because they don't seem to let you search for a word easily. The Free Dictionary also remembers the last few words that you looked up which is nice, too.<br /><br />Update:<br />The first time I tried to use this without a WiFi connection, I was disappointed that I couldn't use it.  But, when I got back home, I was able to download the offline version, so now I can use it even when I don't have a WiFi connection!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|First rate acting, cinematography, direction, not to mention storyline. It may be soap opera, but the best!  Have just begun the latest &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; since Downton was so fine. &#34;Upstairs&#34; holds no candle to &#34;Downton&#34; - an amazing difference in quality, especially actors..
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I needed a calculator for my Kindle.  This one was free.  It's just a calculator and behaves similar to all other calculators.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This is a really great book and i recommend it to any kid ! Its really funny and amusing<br />BUY IT ! Lol
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app gives adobe capabilities to my Kindle.  I use it constantly.  It is easy to use, and convenient. Of course the price was right, free.
B008X2MQ3Q|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie. They don't make really good scary movie anymore. It doesn't need blood and guts to be truly scary.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Savages is a violent action packed movie .similar to pulp fiction. An interesting plot with with many twists and turns. The cinematography is well done ...Not a family movie but great late night movie
0786891416|1.0|Really?  Castle would write a much better book than this.  The level of writing is almost insulting.  Don't judge the show by this trash.
B00BESKTMG|1.0|I grew up on cheesy kung fu movies. Although they weren't profound, some of them were entertaining. This however was bad all around. No inkling of a plot, no memorable moments, just nonsensical, cliche,  over the top dialogue and action. You won't get your time back! Run away!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book not only covers a military members perspective but also his wife's.  Highly recommended this book to anyone.  Military or not.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|TL;DR - this game's fun as a time waster but only because it's free, plus is large and can ONLY be downloaded over a Wi-Fi network.<br /><br />  This is a good game to play,<br />especially if you're in the waiting room at an office, or in line at the DMV, etc...<br /><br />  It's not AS fun as the air traffic control that was one of our previous FAOTD, but is a lot of fun as a time waster.<br /><br />  It looks great and runs perfectly. the gameplay is very smooth,when you start, you'll find yourself enthralled, and after looking up, you'll notice you've been playing<br />this game for an hour.<br /><br />While  I probably wouldn't pay the .99&cent; or $2.00 or whatever the original price was for this game, it is definitely worth the  DL as the FAOTD.<br /><br />BUT! Know that.You can't download this game off the network (even 4 g). It won't let you and says &quot;must download over a Wi-Fi network (and still takes around 2minutes to complete).<br /><br />All in all, I say download the game, because it's pretty fun.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I did feel the misery of life during that time and know the story of Jean Valjean.  I will be more knowledgeable when I see the movie.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Good simple program to quickly check the status of my Kindle battery. This program also shows how long the battery will last depending on what it is being used for (reading, games, movies, etc). I highly recommend this program.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I couldn't  stop playing. I am now going back to try to better my times. An excellent match three game.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I don't normally re-watch movies, but I had to watch this movie twice. Now I have the soundtrack to listen to as well. Our whole family likes this album and we listen to it in the car.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|At first this production may seem strange but if you give it a chance, you will find it unique and interesting. It's a good film to discuss with friends.
B00899F0G8|5.0|This is the Best Show in the world! I love that if i accidently miss a show i can watch it with my tv pass! I plan to buy a tv pass for the 4th season!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I find this simple to control, retro inspired app to be a frequently used game.  The levels are the perfect length whether you want to play for just 2-3 minutes, or even an hour.<br /><br />The game itself seems inspired by Space Invaders, Galxian, etc. and the graphics show that it does pay homage to those games....  It's just as easy to jump into this game and play.  No learning of combo moves, or loosing a life while looking for a &quot;smart-bomb&quot;.  Just tap to start each new wave, move your ship while it auto shoots, and pickup rewards.<br /><br />Overall, I feel that the game is perfect for anyone that likes to have a fun and fast to start playing game.<br />The levels are a perfect length, but it's the automatic pause between waves that make the game.  You can play during a TV commercial and know that the game will give you a chance to finish a wave and then you can simply ignore your device until the next commercial break.
B003TZ9EGO|5.0|If you are a fan of Lady Gaga then enough said, I need not go on.  If not then what can I say. But you will jam to the music in the CD.  Get it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is nice a really fun game love love love love love love love love love love love love it
B008220D5K|5.0|It will take about the first ten minutes before you can really get into it. I have never laugh so hard at a movie in a long time, I think a lot of the lines were off the cuff by the actors them-self and played off each other. Movies like this one can make you forget your worse day at work. It's about a man with two girls his wife lies about her age of 38 she is like Jack Benny always 39 both have their own business which is going under and the other don't know.  (Spoiler Alert)--------> (her Gynecologist told her she was 40 she ask how he knew that, he said I can count the rings). I had to pause it long enough to get off the floor. Enjoy the movie I know I did.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved the book.  The author has devised a new take on some old superstitions and beliefs to reinvent a remarkable tale of love and loss.
B003G94BZC|4.0|I love this show and this season is when you get to know the new characters. Love the next season though.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Never have I watched a show that takes me through all of my emotions! The show flies by because it is so good!!
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I love Doctor Who and this season is one of Matt Smith's best. One of my favorite seasons. If you don't watch this show, you really should.
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|From Radagast the Brown or Jar Jar Binks coming out of no where, to swords that detect ORCs not glowing, queer dialog with the great goblin and the worst character insertion of AZOG the Ork, dead for over 500 years. Someone needs to be spanked or worse.
1451695195|5.0|Many who are sure of their faith will find this fascinating - a doubting Thomas coming clean - others who may have some doubts will see a new perspective, most likely convincing. Those without faith should surely select this for reading.
B0013O123Q|1.0|Amateurish photography technique left my head spinning. Stupid dialog.  It was a lot of money per minute, but at least it wasn't 90 minutes of my life wasted....
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Unlike most of the games I've played this game allows  you  enlarge the sceen which makes it easier to find the  hidden objects. This is a really nice feature.
B005I548B4|2.0|throughout the book, this was a great read, but from personal taste i really didn't like the ending of story
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|The first level is impossible to do.  The rest isn't too bad.  The idea of the games is good though.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham starts out in his casual style, painting a picture of a small three-person law firm chasing ambulances on the south side of Chicago.  Then, there big break comes when they have an opportunity to carve out their share of a mass-tort law suit.  Just when they think they're in tall cotton, the case falls apart and the very existence of their little firm is in question.  A great twist in the middle of the action, and a great ending.  Grisham hasn't lost his touch.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked the book a lot. At times it got a little to much into detail about the abusive relationship. But in the end it was a feel good story and reminds readers of the power of love:)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|its a cute little romance. I liked it. and easy read kind of like watching a hallmark movie. or a movie on lifetime channel. I liked it..
B0063IH60K|1.0|I downloaded the &#34;free&#34; version.  The ads are absolutely annoying.  After the cards are dealt, the screen changes to an advertisement...some of them are videos and hard to cancel out of.  If you want this app, I would suggest paying for the ad free version.<br /><br />If not for the ads, I would have given it 5 stars!
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Im still reading it. half way through. its ok not the greatest book but its good...its not the kind of book that you can't put down..
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Such an interesting story of how our lives and perceptions are shaped through our experiences.  Everyone looks at the world through a different lens which makes up our individuality.  It is interesting to see what a person's reality is that struggles with a mental illness.  I believe many people block some of what is real in their lives so they don't ever face the painful feelings this may bring.  Some a little worse than others......I enjoyed the story and had a hard time putting the book down. I finished it in 2days.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Keeps you interested all the way to the end. You can picture everything happening like you were actually there.Looking forward to more of this series.
0062014102|5.0|I bought this for my husband while he finishes up his last couple months in prison and he LOVED it!! It will make you re-evaluate your perceptions of reality - but in a good way! I highly recommend this book to anyone that loves reading anything scientific/spiritual!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book I read the book before the I seen the movie and I must say I liked the book better than the movie. Buy it,read it, love it. i did.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|This was another solid batman depiction. Epic fight scenes and great characters. The joker is pure evil and batman is unyielding. Overall well worth the money
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put it down. The story line is great. The characters are believable and true to themselves. The author did a great job of putting you in the story.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I bought this screw driver set when I had accidentally spilt soda on 2 Xbox 360 controllers.  While its possible to get bits that fit my specific needs, it would have cost me the same cost as this set was.  This set includes just about every bit you'd need to work on Xbox 360 controllers to PS3 controllers to iPods, iPhones, iPads, tablet pc's, and everything else out there that you need specialized bits for that you can't find at Home Depot or Lowes without spending $75 or more for kits that includes crap parts or bit you don't need or screw drivers you don't want because you've got a bunch already.<br />This set is actually very solid.  It even gives you bit adapters so you can use one other standard handles.  It's a no-brainer!
B007KZY1YY|3.0|I don't really rate the trilogy to be honest the two main characters annoy me but this was the best of the bunch
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Love this book!!!!!! I usually take a long time to read a book because I get busy with life, but this book was so well written that it grabbed my attention!! I finished reading this book in less then a week and that is fast for me. I had to force myself to put down the book so I could attend to my daily responsibilities. Looking forward to reading \\"Walking Disaster\\" :)<br />So happy my friend recommended this book!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Around the world in 80 days is a well designed app that runs fine on both flavors of Samsung Galaxy tab 10.1 running Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean Android OS. The game has the perfect amalgamation of puzzle and complexity to make this game a winner.<br /><br />This is based on Jules Verne Victorian travelogue and the presentation is superb with excellent graphics and animation. The game is colorful and very pleasing to look at. Sound effects are good and the music can be turned off as it may get repetitive after couple of hours.<br /><br />If you love matching puzzle game this is perfect. My wife loves it. When your wife is happy you are happy and life is good. For that reason alone it is well worth it and deserves five stars.<br /><br />Playrix LLC makes excellent quality games - Highly recommended.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Since Google Reader announced its discontinuty, I`ve been searching for a good replacement of this service. Finally, I have found Feedly... And It`s even better than Reader!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I personally love this game a lot. It uses the full screen for overgenerous graphics and plays beautifully on any size Android tablets. Sound effects are perfect for this type of game and I have played this on Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy tablets and it looks gorgeous! - Wow! Superb Presentation.<br /><br />If you love RETRO games this is no brainer, it feels very good to play this game and brings back those nostalgic moments of my childhood when used to play these games on PCs and game consoles.<br /><br />Game is worth the money! - Highly recommended! Five stars.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Muy amena narración, muchos personajes hábilmente entrelazados para hacer de un libro extenso, un fácil recorrido por un gran acontecimiento histórico
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A great character study and character arc of the protagonist, who goes from ordinary girl in suburbs of London to someone who takes risks and opens her heart to paraplegic man she cares for.  I loved this book and know you will, too!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am enjoying this set and catching up on what I had missed. I look forward to watching all of the episodes. This is a good quality set.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|I enjoyed this book with lot of surprises and twists to the story. I would recommen this book for anyone looking for a thrilling mystery.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|These are some vintage recordings from 1968 and 1969.  Some of the material we have heard in different forms from other releases. The musicians are plenty, but Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums drive home the majority of the music! The sound is really fantastic!! These songs were recorded 45 years ago and they sound like Jimi recorded them yesterday!  We all know that Jimi Hendrix was in a league of his own. He could extract sounds out of his Fender that no one has been able to achieve to this day!!  I plunked down $11.99 for the bonus track at Target. If it is still available  \\"Buy It\\" this version has a 20 minute jam that is Jimi at his best! Some people are calling this greed, scraping the bottom of the barrel,etc.  I call this ear candy for the die-hard Hendrix fans who are always wanting more Jimi!! So keep on searching the vaults I will gladly shell out ten bucks every time you find some more Hendrix to listen to!!  It shows how much of a guitar legend this man was.  He has been dead for close to 43 years and still has a huge following.  All of us fans who were lucky enough to be around when his music was current. In 2013 he has a new younger fan base who seek out the music to see what this \\"Guitar Legend\\" was all about, my 20 year old daughter listens to him alot and is a true fan!!  Thanks Jimi You were and still are the BEST!!!!!
B000SLP4SE|4.0|The movie is great Mark Wahlberg plays a sniper on the run from the U.S. government.  The acting is good and the on site filming gives the movie a good look.
0385344333|5.0|I have read 6 of them so far and never ran into a &#34;dud.&#34;<br />The author keeps you on the edge throughout the story.<br />You never want to place the book down and look forward to your next reading.
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|I thought this movie was pretty good /okay. It was a little slow in the beginning and some of the action scenes were good but overall nothing spectacular.
B001OSIV62|4.0|I enjoyed watching this film showing all of the ins and outs of this event.  I remember seeing it on the nightly news, and was fascinated by the sheer fearlessness of this man.  This comes from some one who is a little afraid of heights.  I really enjoyed learning what these people did behind the scene to pull this off.  I think kit was a bit much for the government to prohibit him from ever coming back to the states at all ever!
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a fun and addicting game. Planning where to put everything is part of the fun. Watching the little life flights is cute, just wish invest points were easier to get.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Best holster I have ever owned.  The belt clip wraps around the belt keeping it from falling off.  I wish the made a holster for my Leatherman.

B008CP6RWU|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She plays this game all the time and loves it.  Well worth the price I payed at Amazon.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Good book!  One of the best ones about Harry Bosch.  First-rate story telling and kept you on edge until the end.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good mystery.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and felt it explained baseball very well, even to readers (such as myself) with no prior baseball knowledge.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I downloaded an excerpt on Kendall just to see what it was about and couldn't stop.  Downloaded the rest of it and read it in 2 days.  My husband read it and he loved it, too.  Wonderful book!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|a different s.k. novel; don't miss it. quick read for 900+ pages; don't mess with the past!  jfk assassination facts.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|As a long-time Burdon fan, I was pleased to see that he's still got it. Great CD for fans and non-fans alike.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have one every race and I have gotten a perfect every time I practiced something. My horse is very sweet.
B00AIBZJLG|4.0|This is a great movie that would really rate 4 1/2 stars. Only downside is that performances do not convey the vast multi-faceted aspects of live Cirque stage shows.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Game is really fun, but probably uses a lot of battery life with the vibrating when you win, lose, shoot.
B00AFOS6QG|2.0|I was expecting so much more from Nick Cave. I'm a fan & recommend that you give this one the boot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so adicting. I can not stop playing me and my brothers play every chance we get. Could use some updates though
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Love the music. It is fun & keeps my son entertained. He now walks around the house humming the theme song.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Got this game for free and its well worth it... It asks for you to make purchases often,like most games but with patience and practice you will be at level 10-15 in no time. The graphics are cute and colorful, better than other similar games. In my opinion, it's fine for ages 6 and up
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I have wonderfully enjoyed this massive book. It was a great book and I know that I would love to read it again
B00ANW33CM|5.0|This is one of the few games I play over and over. It starts out easy and gets progressively harder. Once I got through a section, I went back and played each game until I had 3 stars which has made the game last longer. Some are very hard when you do this.
B00BESNKB8|3.0|S'ok. Russel Crowe has a cool knife. Batista is a beast. It's weird watching a kung-fu movie in English. I'm still a huge fan of the Wu-Tang and RZA, but the movie is take/leave.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I think this app is great. I can keep in touch with my friends after school or really anywhere where I have Wi-Fi. If u don't have Wi-Fi than you can't send texts to people. Over all I think its a great and easy to use.
B0012NO316|5.0|Each time I see this movie I pick up a few more of the great lines.  The acting is fantastic, but not a &#34;They all lived happily thereafter&#34; ending.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|They need to tell you up front that this will work with only certain products.  I was under the impression that it would work with most a/v gear, not so.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I like the book and always have.  I'm still having a few problems getting familiar with my Kindle but it's working out.
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|Too long, some areas having too much uninteresting detail and philosophical discussion.  Hardships and circumstances were almost unbelievable although possible as the author experienced this himself.
B009LGO88E|5.0|this is such a great product. This helps so much wit shooter games like MGS Snake Eater and RE Revelations.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Excellent cast except for Russell Crowe who does not have the best voice for this wonderful role of Javert. Otherwise, it is remarkable!
B00280LYHS|5.0|Great ending and an amazing adventure of a lifetime! One of the best books I have ever read...young readers will love it
B005S9EJ14|5.0|You can never go wrong with the Dench and Smit combo! THey are the standard for excellence in acting. I hope they continue as long as possible.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The creators should change how energy work u should have the energy producers produce energy so no new building need to produce energy
B006QQQ5SI|5.0|Being a mild bird watcher, I enjoyed seeing how fanatical one can become.  Birds are very interesting.  I am anticipating my big day in May when I go with friends to Magee Marsh and see all the people watching warblers.
B008Y5QDTU|1.0|Not worth the money, so unfortunate we  could not rent this and had to buy it.<br />Poor character development and quite frankly Tina could not handle such a major leading role.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|oh my gummybears I absolutely love this. I am completely addicted to it I would recommend this to anyone and EVERYONE! lol
B009GX7IRA|4.0|Nicely paced, interesting interactions.  The characters have matured, and the show just gets better with time. One of my favorite seasons and shows.
0425098478|5.0|The anecdotal information provided in this gem is wonderful.  It actually describes my work environment and a popular 'management' style to the letter.  What I think is interesting about this book also is how, the One Minute manage does very well and seems competent. However, I'm sure many manager who aren't competent attempt this same management style.  I'll read other books from this author, as it obviously is a series, though this book is an excellent start.<br /><br />My only concern is that while it makes 'others' accountable for their work, it doesn't really give much insight on how the One Minute Manger actually organizes his/her time.  THAT, would be worth reading...
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book is historical fiction that rings true - beloved characters you won't soon forget - great for book clubs.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This game is really fun but also super hard.  It is okay but not great.  I would say buy it cause it's free
B00B6OEDS4|5.0|When I first heard Rhye, Sade came to mind. The singer of those songs exude the same kind of soul sensibilities that Sade exudes. Rhye was definitely a sensuous woman whose first album is aptly titled 'Woman'. Alas, all was revealed not too long ago that Rhye is a male duo and lead singer Mike Milosh whose voice is captivating and most of all, deeply seductive as he croons on Open, the Fall and my personal favourite, Last Dance. While he is a dead ringer for Sade, Rhye's music (with partner Robin Hannibal) is luscious with a modern, neo-soul quality, sparsely peppered with the quintessential electronic touch. This is a collection of the best ten tracks for the year 2013 so far.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This I'd a verY good gamme .  But temple run I'd more addictive I don't now why but temple run is still butter this is Good to cause it has a ziplin FREe game to Also has a min a cart  in a min plus it has butter graphics then temple run actually a parity goof games. Buy this game Perez you are so Dawson
B0054SMID0|4.0|Well-acted and written. Didn't think I was a Matthew McConnaughey fan until now! Gripping story, well told, a tribute to Michael Connelly, the author.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best app that I have ever played in my entire life!  I have probably spent a full day on it!  It is better than lots of PAID apps.  And it's free!  If you don't have this app, you are missing out.  If I could give Temple Run 1000000000 stars I would!  You really need this game!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I &#34;jumped in&#34; to The Good Wife Season Three, now am traveling back in time. Love the beginning. The acting is superb.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Extremely high quality, smooth gameplay, few crashes, but I don't think that the graphics are up to par on the faces they look kinda ugly and fake. Sorry gameloft, other than that I love the game!!!
B00BHMF578|4.0|Well-scripted, directed, acted. Even though we knew the ending, we were kicking our feet at the end. Intriguing sideline to a bigger political show going on.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|My family and I (surprisingly my husband is included) absolutely LOVE this movie & all of the characters recommend this to anyone looking for a great movie & some laughs.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really enjoy this game - there are lots of different towers - I also like the shading that indicates tile being available.  An &quot;undo&quot; button would be nice for players that are not too good at it, like me!
B008Y2IU12|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I think that they did a really good job with all of the characters & the story line.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I am knew at this game, like it very much. Easy to learn.If  you have never played played this game, fun. Easy to do on your kindle
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is the best game ever get it I give it 88 stars if like it rate it Othello<br /><br />fjghjv
1400067820|3.0|I loved Taleb's &#34;Fooled by Randomness.&#34;  I liked &#34;Black Swan,&#34; though he'd become a little less practical and more generally philosophical.  This one is a harder read, for me at least.  Probably still worth it if you liked the other books.
B000NY12LO|4.0|I really liked this book! Jodi really touched on so many different points of view. She really did her research. It made me think differently about the shooter. While still guilty I could relate to him. I think we all have been bullied at school a time or two just not the extent of what he dealt with though.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Disorganized writing, confusing characters, hard to keep them apart.<br />interesting subject, more research would help.  Would not recommend to friends.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|If you like historical fiction, you will love this book.  The characters are well developed and the story engaging.  A fast read, hard to put down!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Absolutely love this series! Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman rock! Best take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic with a modern vibe. I cannot wait for Season 3!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It was great! I enjoyed every second of this game. I only wish it had not ended so quickly. The puzzles were fun and the find its were just challenging enough.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Best book yet!<br />I was very surprised at the end!<br />All kids should read this book!<br />Can't wait for the next book!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Interesting, but my son and I think this is not G 5's best game. I. I I I I I.I.I I
630282091X|4.0|Love the book. This is a very simple video great for young children 3 to 5 years of age. Owl Moon is a favorite of mine and my family.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Excellent game if you like puzzles, adventure and good graphics. I I I I I I I I I I
B00992CF6W|5.0|ITS fun for people that like building stuff MUST BUY OR ELSE IT IS AN EPIC GAME MUST TRY THEY MADE IT FOR US NOT FOR JERKS THAT DON'T LIKE IT<br /><br />PLZ BUY PLZ
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Now I just use Twitter on my Kindle Fire and it is amazing. It is really easy to use and you can spend hours &#34;tweeting &#34;
B0077EBWVI|5.0|This was a nice update on the original. The casting was spot on and I loved the dancing, especially the finale. Fun!
B009GRMH7C|4.0|Liked it,but I have a problem with the audio while streaming. I don't get the 5.1 surround sound as advertised..

B0086700CM|5.0|I think that temple run is a great game! I love all the clever ways it tells you that you died! like you made a tasty snack! :)
B000YXDUAA|1.0|I paid careful attention to make sure \\"DVD\\" was included in the description before purchasing. They sent me a blu-ray.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|Really enjoying this, especially the performance from Kate Maberly, with her classy acting style. Her performance was praised by many and quite par with Tatum O'Neal of Paper Moon or Keisha Castle-Hughes of Whale Rider. I've seen a lot of The Secret Garden's screen adaptation, so far, this is the best. Recommended for those who would like to see this classic.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|This guy is rivaling Sean Connery he is great with the action stuff they need to keep putting out more with him
072325804X|5.0|I bought this book for my friend's baby as a shower gift (beatrix potter was her shower theme). Its a beautiful book that i'm sure her son will cherish for years.  Well printed, nice paper stock, beautiful cover.
B00ARAO720|4.0|What I saw was great but fell asleep and it expired before I could watch it and I didn't want o pay twice
B005C0DHEY|5.0|This movie is a depressing eye-opener. The subject matter is especially depressing because this is going on all around me. What once was a small country town now has hotels popping up right and left (with ridiculous rates) and there's just all kinds of activity and tons of traffic. But when these temporary workers follow the oil on down the road, what's going to happen to all these businesses that popped up overnight???<br /><br />Fracking is causing more worries than just our water (although that's the biggest). I really enjoy documentaries, and this is one of the best I've seen. Prepare to be shocked.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Great movie with a awesome ending I would watch this movie again if the opportunity arose Denzel is a great actor
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I enjoy quiet time watching this series together. It is good, wholesome entertainment, and we are looking forward to series 4.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|I thought it was a bit ridiculous I was disappointed the Stallone version was about the same maybe better I thought it would be better, I like Karl Urban movies.
B000FA675C|1.0|Just downloaded it onto my kindle. Many of my friends loved it so I know I will also. Cannot wait to start it.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great Bruce Willis is always awesome great action would be a great to have a sequel to it I would watch it again
0439023521|5.0|I bought this book to read for myself and then to put in my classroom library. My students and I love it!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Great movie it was an awesome add on to lord of the rings would suggest it to anybody that likes that type
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Love how easy it is to stream HD quality movies from Amazon.  The acting/performances in this movie were amazing and now I am only sorry that it was not awarded more academy awards.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|Simon is a great song writer ang Garfunkel knew Simon is, therefore, they combined and prduced Great songs and albums!!
B00AKKS278|3.0|I liked a lot of the advice in this book, but I thought it was a bit heavy on the front end with respect to background information about the author.  Just skim over most of that.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|When I got this app, I didn't realize how realistic it was. The horses are so cute and they do act a lot like real horses. I love it!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a wonderful story.  The live of the main character is heart-wrenching, and speaking a someone who loves flowers, I really appreciated the way flowers were worked into the story, and how they became a healing aspect of her life.  The story shows how hard it is for people to seek healing and forgiveness in the absence of communication and support.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this book!  The character John Corey has a sarcastic edge to him that I see as a bit like my reaction to things.  The book is long enough to develop characters and hone a good plot, not like some of the &#34;novellas&#34; we see on the book shelves today.  There are twists and turns in the book as well as some love interests (sex), which adds to the overall journey.  The final outcome was not a surprise; however, I like a final twist or two.  I know that you will enjoy this book.  After reading this book as my first Nelson DeMille, I went on to read all of his other John Corey books; now I have his other books ahead of me.  I am always pleased when I stumble across a new author (to me) and get the opportunity to go back and read his other offerings; lots of good hours ahead for me!
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Well, Lauren Oliver has left me speechless again! I was bawling at the end of book 1, gasping at the end of book 2, and now speechless.  I really enjoyed the ride that Oliver took me on but the ending was like leaving us at the top of a roller coaster loop!  Lauren has a writing style that creates such vivid images that I'm just going to hold on to the hope that she will continue this story with a fourth book!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Love it, it is much better than the movie. It makes it more in intense and very enjoyable for anyone who reads.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app better than any of them. It does take a but getting used to and cannot see paying for it because the ads don't bother. me.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Would recommend this game.  Clues were understandable.  Different  picture entered were well done.  Was able to complete within a reasonable amount of time.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love this app.  Works much better then the built in keyboard on the galaxy s3..  So far there is not much I can say bad about it.  Just love the app. Look is very nice also..  Very happy with this app.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|We enjoyed Argo for the reality and information it provided.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 was the sound was irritating.  It went from high pitched to low pitch too often and we found ourselves putting the sound up and down constantly which interfered with the enjoyment.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I would recommend this app to everyone you know who likes horses. I keeps me entertained when i am bored.
B006YC74E8|2.0|I only found this product useful for covering up blemishes and acne and stuff like that. I would recommend PicsArt as a great app instead of this one
B00992CF6W|5.0|Do not use skin stealer on  minecraft pocket edition it messes it  up  to fix it delete it and download it again but it's worth 7$ .
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book provides insight into Special Ops and requirements to be a Silent Warrior.  I initially said I would not purchased the book because of the violation of this principle.  After Zero Dark Thirty released I decided to purchase and found it to be a good read and very insight.  Minus the somewhat negative views of leadership and the Commander in Chief it was a good read through the eyes of an operator.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|Strongly recommend this soundtrack. Even if you didn't play the game, its worth listening to. Its a mix of rock, industrial, & dubstep.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Not at all what I had expected from the one or two previews I had seen,but I really enjoyed this movie. And it was nice to see both a female character with more gumption, and a break from the traditional family arrangement in Disney movies. This I think was also a good movie for me because I identify with having difficulties relative to my mom but being close to my dad.
B005BRS8Z6|3.0|I don't know if the author is just not a great writer, or if he was trying to make a heftier book, but I felt like I kept reading the same sentiment over and over in each chapter, like he said exactly the same thing but three different ways. While I thought what he had to say was important, and worth reading, I would have liked to edit it about in half. It's not that I mind reading long books, I just prefer concise writing.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|And he loved it! It is also one of my favorite Disney movies, and Eric enjoyed it as well. They did a great job making the movie attract not just young girls, but all ages and all genders of moviegoers.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|GREAT ACTING LOVE IT  -  GREAT PERIOD PIECE  - LIKE TO SEE MORE LIKE IT -  LOVE THIS SERIES OF PLAYS
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series had a lot of ups and downs. Such a roller coaster of story telling! I laughed (mostly at Maggie Smith's character. She is a hoot!
B008MX7Z32|4.0|All in all it works great. My only problem is its not quiet tall enough for my nightstand which is what I got it for. But otherwise it works perfectly.
B002C949KE|5.0|Very well written and interesting information on human behavior. You do not need to have a background in psychology (or economics) to understand the material.
1609613937|1.0|This book puts forth an interesting concept, one I fell for hook-line-and-sinker: that filling up on starch and vegetables while eschewing meat, dairy and fat will result in weight loss and better health.<br /><br />The author has not only written this book about the concept (as well as a few others) but has also created youtube lectures and has a website about his way of eating.<br /><br />He writes that one does not need to count calories or measure portions. He writes \\"the more you eat the more you lose\\". He even says it's not an \\"all or nothing\\" plan.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the concept does not seem to work perfectly for everyone. After eight months of strictly following this diet, I have not lost an ounce but actually gained three pounds. In the meantime, my best friend began to follow the \\"paleo\\" way of eating and has since lost 20 pounds and has his cholesterol drop drastically.<br /><br />I visited the website and was going to post on his website discussion forum, but the regular posters there become downright insulting to those who question this protocol. They declare that the person for whom the diet is not successful must be cheating.<br /><br />The doctor's message forum is pretty much an online cult. Many of the reviews here are written by recognizable regulars on the McDougall message forums. They also argue with the Amazon reviewers who do not \\"worship at the same altar\\" --- just read the comments on the not-so-glowing reviews. Hostile. Name-calling. Arrogant and rude. Argumentative.<br /><br />It's the same on the message forums, where anyone for whom the program doesn't work as it's laid out in the book are treated with suspicion, insulted and accused of not following the plan or cheating.<br /><br />Despite what the book says, the \\"regulars\\" often recommend that those for whom the program hasn't worked should measure their food and calculate calories in a Cron-o-meter (Hello! Can you say W**gt Watchers?). Another common piece of advice is to cut down on starch and eat more vegetables (but, gee, isn't it supposed to be the STARCH solution, not the celery and kale solution?)<br /><br />I noticed that those who mention the \\"paleo\\" diet are treated with hostility and quickly labelled as \\"trolls\\". I have no desire to try paleo but find it interesting that my paleo friend has had so much success while McDougall diet has been a total failure for me. Think I'd ever mention such a thing on the McDougall forums? Heck no!<br /><br />Anyway, I don't recommend buying the book --- you can pretty much find all the info in this book for free on Dr. McDougall's website --- but keep in mind that it doesn't work for everyone and also tread carefully in the message forum.down on starch and eat more vegetables (but, gee, isn't it supposed to be the STARCH solution, not the celery and kale solution?)<br /><br />I noticed that those who mention the \\"paleo\\" diet are treated with hostility and quickly labelled as \\"trolls\\".

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the biggest best game I have ever played in my little life<br /><br />I am 9year old girl my name is Marissa
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|My daughter was 8 when this came out, and is now almost 21.  She came home over spring break and wanted to see it again, so we watched it.  We still laughed out loud and enjoyed it immensely.  Loved it!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Retro and fun even my boyfriend loved it.  At first I though it be mediocre since it reminded me of space invader but now that I've played it, I'm hooked!
B00138J342|5.0|Vs. has to be one of the few follow up albums that doesn't suck.  From &#34;Glorified G&#34; to &#34;Daughter&#34; this disc rocks throughout.  I'm sure nostalgia is peppering my review as 10 and Vs. came out during some of the best times of my life.  But 20 years later it is still amazing
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game is one my son really wants. It said it would be able to downloadable on our device and I was charged for it but it didn't download. I'm very unhappy.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game it is neat and has lots to do to keep me busy.  The time to get energy could be less but it works out ok.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I wish I could give it no stars because I tried several times to download it to my sons device (a nabi) and it should download the other temple run games have but this one won't. I was charged for it though. I'm very unhappy.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Performances are outstanding.  Subject matter is pertinent to today, although set in 1950, and cult membership.  So depressing.  So heavy.  Not a light moment in the whole movie.  When it is over, you can't understand what was the attraction between The Master and Freddie in the first place....although it would make for a great discussion and arguably could be Freddie's choice of beverage.  Amy Adams plays a very stoic person so contrary to what she usually does.  PSH is perfection in his role as the guru with the gift of gab.  Phoenix transformed himself into a skinny, hunched, confused and addicted character so full of flaws you can't understand how he has managed to stay alive as long as he has.  The ending is slightly confusing.  Probably another discussion.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Can't tell you why I like reading this book but after seeing the moving again I decided it was time to read Hugo again to see how he expressed some of his writing and how it differed from the movies that have been made.
1439148953|4.0|Easy reading.  Great discussion book for book club.  Author was descriptive in his portrayal of life in Ireland and Brooklyn NY.
B005PK56TA|3.0|I had heard good things about this series and was looking forward to watching the free first season. Around the third episode i started to get bored and didn't finish out the series beyond 7, I think. It got to the point of being rather ridiculous.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I just started watching Downton this past month and have completed all three seasons. I love the series; the characters (except Elizabeth Mcgovern with her silly accent), the period clothing (the dresses and jewelry are gorgeous) and the story lines. My complaint, and reason for my 4 star review, is the exaggerated time lapses between episodes. I end up feeling like we 'missed out&#34; on these wonderful characters lives and the fact that two main, and beloved, characters were killed off. With that said, I love Dowton Abbey and eagerly await season 4!!!
B0089BSM70|5.0|I love the Halloween series and this one has the best (in my opinion) kills of the series. Where are all the people in the hospital? It nevere looks like that when I've been in one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very good awesome game. I like it. my kids do too. I love the graphics.  never boring. love love it
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I have never seen a movie like this in a while I geeked out throughout this whole movie. I loved it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is awesome and I am 10 years old and my b-day is 5/22/13 so this game is just awesome.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a great book for someone who is looking for a mix of emotions.There are sad moments and happy moments.
B00B769XB8|4.0|you have to like scifi fantisy to enjoy this movie.It's entertaining and the acting isn't too bad either. I'll watch is several times.
B009GLHF5C|5.0|great cd, love the unsustainable song, my kids act like robots when its on and ask me to replay it constantly
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I never would have picked up this book on my own. I saw the movie and didn't like it. In the movie I didn't understand the relationship between Katnis and Peeta. Everyone said &#34;you have to read the book, the book is so much better.&#34; So I did. The book is great! It Cleared up alot of questions. I'm going to have to rewatch the movie now to see if it makes more since. The movie does follow the book quite accurately though. I give the book 4 stars because although I wasn't blown away I was pleasantly surprised.
B005XOPEOU|4.0|theses songs are good, some of them stick in my head all week. Coldplay is nice softer rock than most
B004H6G0TI|5.0|really enjoyable game. very fun and a great deal of work went into keeping it fun and exciting. I hats bad reviews just because it wont work on a device.... that's not a bad game.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I have watched 5 episodes thus far and they have all had very interesting story lines. I feel that the writers have incorporated the science fiction, suspense, and mystery well. The characters that are being developed are a bit unbelievable but perhaps they will &#34;smooth&#34; out. I plan on watching the entire first season so the jury is out on that. The first &#34;pilot&#34; episode was by far the best.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|beautiful voice. great  story  teller. a welcome  to  my  ears'  missed  him  when  he  was  in  St. Louis. I  will be  in  the  front  row  next  time  he  comes  to town.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|Love the Early Beatles. Love the early songs. But when they got what I called weird that was it for me.
B0000DZ3HM|5.0|In short. if you came up  in the  blue note  days, and  missed  some  of  the  artist that  made contributions'  to the  label, this is  a great  way  to  catch  on  what  you  missed. Great  dvd.
B0035JNRXU|2.0|I thought I was watching the real Star Trek but turned it off as soon as I saw it was not. Sure wish Amazon would put Star Wars on Prime. Running out of movies to watch then I will have to go to another site.
1609611543|5.0|This book changed my life. After only six weeks of stopping eating wheat or its derivatives, my fasting glucose went from 110 to 97.  I have lost 14 pounds from my belly, I can walk stairs without pain in my knees, I can eat beans without gas problems, I am no longer lactose intolerant, I look healthy and went from 42 pant size to 39, and still going down.  Buy this book, the knowledge in this book is what the big pharmaceutical companies do not want you to know. Learn why the FDA, the ADA are wrong.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The author has quite an imagination! It held my interest up to the very end. Couldn't put the book down!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Having been charmed by Studio Ghibli's Howl's Moving Castle, I wanted to explore the source material that the movie was based on. Glad am I that I did because the book, as is usually the case, is even more magical and delightful than the movie.<br /><br />Sophie is the eldest of three daughters. And because she reads a lot she knows that as the eldest child she will lead a dull life with no magic in it at all. Until one day the Witch of the Waste crosses paths with her and enchants her. Now Sophie has been transformed from a teenager who dutifully helped run a hat shop into a 90 year old woman. Because she doesn't want anyone to know she has been transformed, Sophie leaves and that is when the fun begins.<br /><br />Enter a world of enchanted girls and transmogrified beings. Of falling stars that long to die, of demons cursed to serve wizards, and of castles that move about the countryside. Enter a world where doors to lead to different lands and where what you see is not what it appears. Now you're in a world where our protagonist Sophie comes to find herself employed as the housemistress for the Wizard Howl and is asked by a fire demon to break the spell he is under so he can be free and where Sophie finds herself experiencing adventures she has never dreamed of. Adventures that will see her caught in a class between wizards and witches and where Sophie will play a key part in breaking curses and solving mysteries.<br /><br />Howl's Moving Castle is a beautifully written modern fairy tale. The characters are well written and the world building is fantastic. Short, sweet, full of charm and humor, the book is a portal into a fabulously engaging story.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Very good for the price, which is free.  Better than the Astro file manager and works well on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9
B009YX02T8|3.0|Liked it but didn't find it as identifiable with the film as I have with previous soundtracks for this film series.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Bought this for my daughter-in-law. she loves it and wants the rest of them.  She has a birthday coming up and there is always christmaws.
B0011Z31V8|5.0|I purchased my first Prince &#34;album&#34; on cassette tape so the love goes way back. I could listen to this one over and over.
B000FA675C|5.0|I love Mystries, especialy when it has to do with my beliefs. I learn alot of history because I trust the author to do his research. I feel that Dan Brown does his.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book.  You cannot stop reading it.  Nicholas Sparks is a good author.<br />It has a surprise ending
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun and the graphics are great. The mini games are pretty easy but it is still enjoyable. It is difficult to get enough gems to buy stuff without spending real money but so far it hasn't stopped me from doing any parts of the game
B003UBTX6S|5.0|As I have stated before, this is a great series of books.  You will want to keep reading to see what happens next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome and its free they update it all the time with cooler and fun stuff every time and they always cone out with a new person its awesome I love this game
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We Love Downton Abbey and wish there were more episodes!! A  Quality Masterpiece every single episode! Whether you Love the Characters' or despise them, we just can't wait to see how it unfolds.
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|This is an excellent free app for someone learning to write using a stylus with a tablet. The writing area is a little smaller than I would like, but you cannot beat the price…free.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Great movie! Could have been in any language but its French and has Ebglish subtitles so you have to be ready to really pay attention. Well worth it! Speaks to the way each of us want to be seen for who we are inside, not our outward appearance. Funny and highly entertaining!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Delightful. Making myself ration it so I won't finish it too soon. I am always sorry when each episode finishes.
B008R6MI8G|5.0|We watched this when it was first released years ago. Then again on St.Patricks day this year. Really enjoyed learning something about the history of Ireland and how the people have  struggled. Learning while being entertained is never bad!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I've been a fan of this HBO series from the very beginning.  It's visually stunning, extremely well cast and stays true to the books.  It doesn't get better than this.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Usually, I love quirky! This I could not get into. Slow, slow, slow and not even a story that caught my interest. Maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind to watch. I kept waiting for it to take off- but it just didn't.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|I loved this. Wish I would have saw it in theater. I agree, it isn't for everyone. If you enjoy the live shows, then check it out.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's just fine.<br />But I hate that the review requires minimum wording.<br />word word word word word word word word
B002NF1ZI6|2.0|Good to have these building pieces to work with.  Ample supply for my 4 grandchildren to use.  Satisfied purchase thank you

B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this app!! Very convenient and easy to use.  Every aspect of EBAY at your fingertips. You won't regret it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I did like this book. Totally unrealistic. No way life is this cooker cutter. It was a fun read. I do want to see the movie
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|I have played it a few times when I am bored with other games. It started off slow but is getting a little more chalenging.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I don't really use the pinterest ap at all.  I am not interested in crafty type things.  A friend installed the program.
B000SEI230|5.0|At first I was skeptical because I saw the movie first and  fell in love with it, when I started reading the book it was nothing like the movie. Although a couple paragraphs into the book showed me that the movie did not do the book justice. Don't get me wrong I loved the movie but the book truly always will be better no matter what the book or movie.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I will use accuweather more during the summer for hurricane information.  I am concerned about the location of the storms.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app. Extremely fun. Got my family into playing it now. We all love it. Deff. Five stars. Great quality
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|occasiionally I enjoy playing Angry Birds.  Especially when I have children in my house!  They are much better at playing angry Birds.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It's kinda like Temple Run but way cooler!This game is just the coolest ever! I encourage everyone to play it because they\\"'ll love it like me
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|What a stunning, haunting collection of Hawaiian songs. Well assembled from some of the greatest Native musicians the Island has ever produced, this is a lovely stand-alone listening experience for any fan of the genre.  But since the big theme of the film is the idea of Legacy, it is entirely appropriate that past and present are represented. Aloha!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I thought it was a great book.<br /><br />It had a great plot. In the beginning it was a little confusing but in the end it explained everything.<br /><br />Overall it was and amazing book with an amazing story line.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Enjoyed the movie overall. Fun story if a bit fanciful at times. They could have left out the religious aspects and it would have made for a better time.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|so much fun to play with pictures on this app! it really works great! love it! I would suggest this!
0307346617|4.0|The book, when I got it, had a small fold on the bottom right-hand corner, so the rating takes a dip because of that. It was still delivered promptly and I'm sure that the book normally comes in pristine condition. As far as the book goes, it is an excellent read. The writer writes as if each &#34;chapter&#34; entry is a different interview that a journalist has done after World War Z to catalogue the history of the event. I'm not really sure how this is going to be made into a movie and stay true to the source material, but that is neither here nor there. It is a fun romp into the post-apocalyptic zombie world that really makes you interested in the workings of this faraway, yet metaphorically similar universe with substantial research and an in-depth care of the prose this writer has crafted. The language is very light and dynamic to the situation, so, through using the medium of a journalist's entries, you are able to drop the veil of a person telling you the story of a story, and you are able to actually wrap yourself directly into that story, letting your own interpretation of the events unfolding in front of you be the guide. All in all, it's a good read. I would recommend reading the Zombie Survival Guide beforehand, as it helps you wrap yourself in the story and adds to the realism. That being said, it is in no way necessary.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|Great content with research back up. I will recommend this book to everyone. If you are stuggle with willpower challenge, this book can help you find out how to build more to success every area of life.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|As I was reading this book, I felt it was based on a true story. I don't think it was written for the reading  level of the general public. I have a Masters degree and still felt that I needed a dictionary next to me as I read it due to the quantity of very high level words. Often this manner of writing interfered with the meaning and flow of the story. This was a very different book in that it was written by the &#34;wife&#34; and &#34;mother&#34; corresponding with her husband about her life as a wife and mother. I would recommend this book if a reader can overcome the obstacles I mentioned.
0385349947|3.0|Even though Sheryl Sandberg's book has nothing to do with lean manufacturing, my news feeds bombarded me with announcements about it. It is probably the only book with \\"lean\\" in the title where it is a used as a verb, in the sense of leaning forward or back. I had heard of Sheryl Sandberg from her work at Facebook, and was curious what she might have to say.<br />The book kept my interest all the way through, which is more than I can say of most business best sellers. It is well organized, with chapters that have descriptive titles, with reasonably dense content that matches the titles. Excluding front and back matter, it is 178 pages long, and suitable for reading on one transcontinental flight.<br /><br />That the book kept me turning pages, however, does not mean I agree with what it says. For someone in Sheryl Sandberg's position to give career advice is a bit like the Mad Men's Don Draper giving advice on picking up women. From her own stories, Sandberg went from Harvard Business School to McKinsey, the Treasury Department, and Google to finally become COO of Facebook in her late thirties. No doubt, she did all of this by her wits, but she doesn't seem to have known adversity. She has not had anything like, for example, the 12 wilderness years that Steve Jobs endured from his firing at Apple to his return. Sandberg made the right professional decisions to get where she wanted to be, but how relevant can her advice be to millions who do not have her abilities or opportunities? She does not brag about being smart, which wouldn't have been, but her resume speaks for itself. She also gives marital and parenting advice, which is courageous for a 43-year old married barely 10 years, with children still in elementary school.<br /><br />Her message is not consistent. When she says that gender discrimination is a waste of talent that we can't afford, that is unarguable. But she goes on to say that the world would be better if half the heads of state were women and half the households were run by men. This is a message of parity, not equal opportunity. If a woman is willing to run into burning buildings and has the strength to carry out a 200-lb unconscious person, her gender should not stand in the way of becoming a firefighter; that's equal opportunity. Mandating that half the firefighters should be women would be  parity,  and parity only makes sense in professions where gender itself matters to performance. Police detectives, for example, must communicate with citizens in tense situations and gender can be a factor in gaining their trust. To her credit, Sandberg does not advocate parity as a legal mandate, but it has been done in other countries. Norway, for example, has quotas of at least 40% for each gender in the boards of public corporations. In the US, it would mean that, by law, 40% of the board of Harley-Davidson would be women and 40% of the board of Victoria's Secret would be men.<br /><br />She criticizes stereotypical \\"Pretty as Mommy\\" messages in toys for girls, but makes her own generalizations about gender-specific behaviors of men and women, asserting, for example, that women apply for positions only when they have 100% of the required skills, while men apply with only 60%.<br /><br />In a few places in her book, she urges her readers to be \\"ambitious in any pursuit,\\" and occasionally hails achievements like her brother's in pediatric surgery, but, everywhere else, the only kind of success she discusses is securing leadership positions in business or government. She does not have much to say to the men and women who are happy to leave endeavors like monetizing social networks to her and prefer to seek cures for AIDS, write novels, or cook. Sandberg is obviously good at what she does, but her book could have used a broader perspective.<br /><br />A surprising story is that, on her first day of work at the World Bank, she did not know how to use Lotus 1-2-3. In my experience of working with MBAs, juggling with spreadsheets is the skill they least lack. The rest of the story is equally surprising: her boss taught her how to use the program. Some years earlier, arriving at the Hahn-Meitner Institute in Berlin to work on my Masters' thesis, I realized that I would need to write Fortran code and didn't know how. But all the help I got from my boss/adviser was his assurance that he trusted me to figure it out. It was understood that, at this level of education, the one thing you are supposed to have learned is how to teach yourself what you need.<br /><br />Sheryl Sandberg describes herself as busy with work and family. So how did she find the time to write a book? The first page says that it was written \\"with Nell Scovell,\\" which is the standard way to acknowledge ghostwriters. At the end of the book, the acknowledgements further indicate that Nell Scovell took a break from her other professional engagements to work on this book. Also a Harvard graduate, Nell Scovell is the author of [[ASIN:B000KLQUMG Sabrina, The Teenage Witch]], and screenplays of other TV shows. Perhaps due to Scovell's professionalism, the book is polished to the point of lacking an authorial voice. To paraphrase the saying attributed to Hemingway, to write, you just stand in front of the computer and bleed. Sandberg's book would have been more compelling if she had done that.adsheets is the skill they least lack. The rest of the story is equally surprising: her boss taught her how to use the program.

0770435726|5.0|It seems some people hate this book and some love it.  My opinion is in the 5 star rating.  I am not going to comment on the \\"artistic value\\"  I will leave that to the wine critics.  I found the book engrossing and very entertaining. The main characters for the most part well developed, with strengths and flaws. Kate was many facited, guilt ridden, and unsure of herself except in her clandestine abilities.  Kate goes through a reinvention of herself despite the obstacles generated by both her past and circumstances. Some might not like the slow pace or Kate's self examination but I found it all intriguing and I was not smart enough to have it all figured out from the beginning.<br /><br />It is also possible that I was influenced by having spent a total of 5 years as an expat with kids in 2 different countries even though hardly as eventful and exciting.  That description rings true.<br /><br />For me this was a very enjoyable read.  Can't wait for Chris Pavone's next effort.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Great series, got it very quickly. Can't wait for season 3! This show is the perfect combination of action, intrigue, and passion.
B009MO5960|1.0|Then Don't.  I know, by writing a negative review about a \\"niche\\" film that has a core fan base, I just lower my ratings.  But I feel I have to be honest, if only to save a couple of poor souls who may regret the time and/or money spent.<br />How does the film go wrong?  It's hard to count the number of ways.  What's sad is that the first three Resident Evil Films were actually very good.  A distinct downward trend started in the fourth film, and unfortunately it went hyperbolic here.<br />When a sequel takes the first thirty minutes (OK, it only FELT like 30 minutes, it wasn't quite that long) simply EXPLAINING THE PLOT of the prior 4 movies, you start worrying that the script writers are searching for a story to tell.  Although to be honest, the plot in the prior movies was sketchy enough that having it all spelled out in sequence wasn't that bad, compared to what comes later...<br />This voice-over retrospective suddenly cuts to a totally different scene: Alice as a perfect suburban housewife with a perfect suburban family.  Except that zombies suddenly attack everywhere.  Then that cuts to a scene of Alice (is it real or is it Memorex--is this the original or only another clone?  Only the script writer can tell..they say it's the real Alice..) nude except for a towel covering her more \\"sensitive\\" areas, lying in the center of a pretty much empty research room.  We are informed that she is \\"being tested\\".  Exactly for what purpose cannot be explained (I think the purpose is pretty obvious--it's for the benefit of those 14 year old males to compare which Alice they like better: tight-leather-fitted Alice, or Alice with nothing but a towel?  And I think the answer is pretty clear).  Anyhow, then the facility seems to go haywire and she's being told that a former enemy is trying to help her escape from this secret \\"Umbrella Corporation\\"  research facility, because she's the best hope to save what's left of mankind outside...<br /><br />Second warning (after the laborious-explain-plot-of-4-movies sequence): you know you are in trouble, if the movie based on a video game starts to feel more like a video game than actually playing a video game...<br />Sonorous explanations warn Alice & friends they must \\"move quickly through the New York Zone into the Berlin zone, then through that into the Moscow zone, and from there to the elevator...expect resistance along the way...I was waiting for the instructions to \\"be sure to grab every power-up you can find along the way, and don't forget your save points in case you wipe\\".  Well after that, basically it's just an hour or two of humans vs. zombies with various weapons...<br /><br />I counted one cool idea in the entire movie, (well, besides Alice with only a small towel) which led to about 30 seconds of cool visuals.  That was the idea that this whole research facility was designed to be unescapable and pretty much undetectable, because it was built ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN in a siberian sort of port, so it's several hundred feet under water with a thick layer of ice and snow on top.  The scene showing the layout underwater was beautiful and a surprise (even  if it was CG).  The rest of the film consists of: lame plot, embarrassing script, acting on a par with the plot and script; not sure what to say about the directing; and the cinematography: well apart from wanting to look good in 3-D, there is really nothing interesting going on.<br /><br />Maybe this cannot compare with the awful thud that was $800 million worth of John Carter landing in theatres--heck this was only $40 million or less, but by comparison with the prior films, therefore by comparison with expectations, and even by comparison to the money spent, it was at least as disappointing as John Carter.  Mila: save yourself!  Don't agree to another sequel, unless you THINK HARD about the script in advance.<br /><br />PS: How did they find hundreds of actresses that looked so much like Alice, to put on that assembly line?  Or were they REALLLY clones?  If so, what did they DO with them after the film was finished?  I can only think this must be the kind of question that occurs to people who think this is a great film...r were they REALLLY clones?  If so, what did they DO with them after the film was finished?  I can only think this must be the kind of question that occurs to people who think this is a great film...
B006M7JCC2|4.0|This is a great book for those who are seeking to understand or are looking for inspiration from NDE's (near death experiences). Not a &#34;woo-woo&#34; account, by any means, as some NDE recounts are.<br />Ms. Moorjani's experiential tale is one that stuns and you will find yourself relating it to friends and colleagues.<br />No spoilers here, you will have to read it yourself to glean the gem from this one.
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|I haven't watched a lot of this yet. It's just hard for me to get into after being spoiled by the great Swedish TV series that have been coming out. It just feels a bit dated.
B006JRY5L8|5.0|After watching season 1 I'm hooked on this show can't wait to watch more.  The show just pulls you in and you can't wait to see how they will get out of the next problem.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Having used this app for 6 weeks now on a daily basis, sometimes more, and knowing what I now know, I'd pay$20 to avoid having to give it up. It's that good.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|First of all thankyou for the great customer service<br /><br />I love the dvd and the condition it came with, brand new and sealed as I wanted and expected.<br /><br />The quality of the dvd and movie was excellent
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|Not only was this movie simply awful, it was also unwatchable due to the constant buffering of the streaming.  Just a totally regrettable experience.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly is an excellent replacement for Google Reader. It has a clean look and is very fast. Most definitely 5 stars!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Product would not install via the amazon app but did install via google play.  Installation issues on Samsung Galaxy tablet, very frustrating.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Awesome sauce but went through it swiftly. Liked the bonus level that tied the story up. Wish it had been longer but it was enjoyable
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Never having been a fan of soap operas, I have been surprised at the power of this one to draw me into its drama.  And not only me, but my whole family----even the men! This series is so well written, so well cast and directed, that we all find ourselves laughing, crying, cheering and booing its various characters. They are each totally believable. The 2nd season, set as it is in the post-WWI era, highlights the social and economic changes that inevitably follow such a war, and the manner in which England's aristocracy reacted to those changes. Of course, you will want to watch Season 1 first, else you will miss the premise of the series.<br /><br />  It is worth watching the whole series just to see the Grand Matriarch of the family in action.  She can level an adversary with a verbal riposte as deadly as assassin's rifle. Had she been at Churchill's side when the 2nd Great War Broke out, no doubt the two of them would have obviated the need for all that bloodshed.<br /><br />  The British have finally found a way to recoup the money they spent fighting us in our revolution.  No matter how many seasons this show runs, we in The Colonies, driven by our inbred fascination with royalty, shall be happily  glued to the 'telly' watching the ups and downs of the Crawley family.  And when its story concludes, we shall race to our computers and Amazon.com to buy the whole series and watch it all over again.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Enjoyed the latest but difficult to see that Jean Marsh (like myself) has gotten old, but she's still really a wonderful actress - my favorite character in the original series.  The brightness and color is fantastic in HD - storyline good -  glad it is available from Amazon Prime.
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|Great Movie absolutely original and Hysterical great watch. Loved it so much bought it on blu-ray right after finishing it!
0030565812|5.0|Nelson Mandela reminds the reader of the struggles and sacrifices made within most of our lifetimes by thousands to ensure equality under the law. I recently returned from Cape Town and a visit to Robben Island, and was compelled to read this moving autobiography of Nelson Mandela. What struck me most was the determination and humility expressed by Mandela during his decades of imprisonment and struggle for the freedom of his people. The book reads easily, and is close to a page turner in spots. While history is written by the victors, and I am certain that there are other sides to this story, the story as presented by Mandela makes for moving and compelling reading. The fact that apartheid fell and South Africa moved towards democracy without the same violence as neighboring Zimbabwe/Rhodesia speaks volumes for all parties in the struggle, and Mandela gives credit where credit was due. The first hand perspective provided by Mandela on the centuries long struggle and his role in it gives the reader access to a modern revolution and modern revolutionary.
0385535147|2.0|A fairly unbelievable plot.....Bannister sits behind bars for 5 years but still can outwit the FBI, goes into Witness Protection, has surgery, then takes the FBI on this wild chase in and out of the country while he gets all of his ducks in a row to keep the hidden money (in 10 oz gold bars no less).  When he gets the money where he wants it, he then EMAILS the FBI two letters explaining that his original information was \\"wrong\\" and now he has the correct information.  Apparently, the FBI still does not have egg on their face and goes down to the Carribean to get the additional information.  All of the money that was spent by the Government giving him the reward, changing his appearance, flying him here and there.....all forgotten because Bannister now knows who really killed the Federal Judge.  The guy he originally \\"framed\\" just \\"gets released\\" cause Bannister says he's the wrong guy.  Everybody gets immunity and they all live happily ever after.  I enjoy legal THRILLERS and this really was not one.  I wanted to like it though. I listened to the Audio CD version.
0425252868|5.0|One of the best aerial combat books about World War II that I have read. Fantastic story. I could not put the book down once I started reading it.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Relay enjoyed this first book in the series. It is a good book to sit down and read on a rainy day.
0822208385|4.0|I ordered this book for my husband who's an Actor and he will be auditioning for a part in the play.  The book itself is very sad, but I'm happy I read it.
B004H4XAXO|5.0|The best Brandon Sanderson has written, the only problem we seem to have to wait for ever for the next book in the series. Hoping the next book is as good as this one.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I became very fond of all the characters, thus I care about what happens to them. Wish there was a season 2.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|If the next book in the series is as good as this one I will become a great fan. I hope the next book is not to far away.
0307474259|5.0|Wonderful &#34;food for thought&#34;... Great case studies and background research for the science behind following a life style that watches carbohydrate intake. It was part of the process tht helped me lose almost 40 lbs. I ave kept it off for over two years already.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I love this reader. It's elegant and engaging, which can't be said for most news readers. More like reading a magazine or newspaper.
1439190275|5.0|This book is the perfect companion to &#34;Why We Get Fat, and What To Do About It&#34; by Gary Taubus. Dr. Eric Westman has an awesome book. My family calls it my second Bible.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|This movie is every bit as good as coraline. I intend to purchase it on blu ray. I love it.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I liked the game but found there was no information on what the Bonus is for with the prizes, what the coins and points mean on the puzzle board mean.  When I use a game I like to know detailed information on the game, and how to play it.  It would help if you upgraded the rules and information.
B009VB97EY|1.0|The movie actually reminded me of Saturday Night Fever but with more cliches and more skin. It was embarrassing to watch Channing Tatum in this role. I honestly couldn't wait for it to be over.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really fun totally play this had some doubt at first but it's really fun u should totally download this call

0425264386|3.0|This one is not\\"action packed\\" as some of the others with unexpected turns.  It is more of a poilitical essayand long on discourse.  My husband is nearly blind so I read to him nearly every night.  I found that I was skipping whole paragraphs to get to the action or to anything that moved the story line forward.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|came in excellent condition and works perfectly!!! bought it for my nieces and they are loving it sooo much! and a GREAT price!!!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|It's Angry Birds with an homage to Star Wars.  I wasn't expecting much, but it turned out to be a lot of fun.  I especially like the levels where you have to deal with gravity wells around planets.  I wish more levels came with the initial purchase, but considering I got it for 99 cents--and Rovio's got to make their money somewhere--I don't mind too much.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I had no idea what to epect from this game when I got it. It just looked like it might be interesting. And it definitely is... interesting. It is very easy to play in that the object is clear. What I really like is that it is never the same way twice but it definitely offers a challenge each time.  I am impressed with the way you can rotate the cube with just a swipe of your finger. It allows you to look at every side and if you angle it just right you will have the corner in front of you and you can see most of two sides at once. Sometimes I can get through the game fairly easy, other times it has me scratching my head and chasing around the cube sides trying to find the matches. All in all a good game for anyonel
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire and, before I found MoboPlayer, the process of watching my home videos on my Fire was rather complicated.  Now, I just drop any movie I have on my laptop into the &#34;Movies&#34; folder on my Fire and I can watch it instantly.  I can even reduce the size of the movie and keep it going while doing other things on my Kindle!
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book has completely charged the way I look at my finances and especially what I view as an asset. He definitely puts forth some radical ways of looking at your money and building wealth. Even someone who is financially conservative and afraid to take risks will find something valuable in this book.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Like the character of Walt Longmire and also wish the made for TV would have continued. I found the book a good story.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|to get gems<br />if you have 250 or more elements<br />250 stars<br />250 diamonds etc.... you keep clicking them you will get one gem<br /><br />also there is a pony he likes to hide in a box.. if you keep finding him you can get a gem. i have gotten 5 gem from him in one day at the most so far.<br /><br />you can buy gems ... they cost real money up to $99.99<br /><br />once in a while when collecting money from the jobs you can get a gem.<br /><br />if you play every day you can get a daily gem up to 2 gems a day.<br /><br />when you level up you also get a gem.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This is a very fun and realistic first person shooter.  It has great graphics but a few glitches and lags.  I wish they would make campaign and multiplayer seperate so it wouldnt take up so much space but i still love this game.  GOOD JOB GAMELOFT!
0143039431|4.0|I have nodoubt my grandson will enjoy it.  Soon I will be done reading and I will pass it on to him.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The Hobbit, prequel to the Lord of the Ring Trilogy, begins an extraordinary journey and provides an amazing foundation for the movie. Peter Jackson started the Hobbit saga with an amazing cast. The costumes and special effects provided a great feeling to the Hobbit.
B004H6G0TI|4.0|Controls work great - left thumb rotates the little plane, right thumb blasts the crap outta ducks, other planes and anything else that might go boom. Fun. Addictive. Easy. Overall, nice FAOTD. Turn the music off and have a BLAST!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|i think this game is very fun. and kind of like super mario bros.  its makes you rate it 5 stars to continue to play which is why I'm leaving this review
B00BESM14U|5.0|I love the timeframe that this movie covers.  I grew up in the 80's and 90's and know all about making mix tapes.  The setting is in Pittsburgh and features the tunnels on several occasions.<br /><br />The movies depicts some extreme ups and downs, but overall is very uplifting and has quite a bit of humor in it.  I don't want to give too much more information and risk spoiling anything.  But you won't regret watching this if you were a high school student in the 80's and 90's.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|thk u... STOOOOP Stooop StooooP.. forcing people to write all these writing - when people don' have time. This is the last survey!!!!
B000NDEXFC|4.0|When I received the DVD, I found out that it's the same as the one I bought before.  I had thought it could be different one performed by different cast.  But it's ok.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I didn't watch any episode of Fringe until 2013, then me and my wife watches the first episode of season 1. We finished that season within a week, it's that good. The characters are all unique looking and believable, the main character was not over-sexualized, and the stories were fantasy with a nice grounding in science. Truly one of the best Science Fictions television shows.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I like the game a lot, but the sound is way off from what it is on my iPhone and PC version.  It's like there is a glitch in the sound on my Kindle.  I would recommend this product, but only after the sound is fixed.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Reminded me of Bioshock,but quicker.  It only took a few hours to get through.  I enjoyed the variety of mini games and the ease of navigating.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|This game is very addicting, I love it. You really need to get this game and try it for your self.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|Surprised so many people thought this was good.  Nonsensical even within the boundaries of time travel movies.  Did we really need the telekinesis?  I don't think so.  This future is boring.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great. My horse is perfect and is very tame it feels so real I can barely believe it is a game. You'll love it,if you like animals
B000YJ85BI|5.0|This is the third in the Old Man's War series. I received the first book, Old Man's War, as part of the Humble Bundle eBooks. Thanks to them I was introduced to a new author and a great series. If you like science fiction, then this is a series worthy of any collection. I have thoroughly enjoyed the first three books, and am planning to purchase the fourth book, Zoe's Tale, this month. Truly a great series.
B00003CY6M|2.0|This is a great movie from 2001. I purchased it in order to add it to my collection of all time favorites. When I put it in to play it was scratched and would not play.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was so glad that the story continued where the first one left off.  Amazing love story and was glad there was another book to finish it off.
B009AP2G26|2.0|I watch with my daughter. Enjoyed earlier seasons, but disappointed in character development and story lines.  There is also less humor. Maybe dividing the show between New York and Lima is too much.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you can get past the 'sex' this is a real love story.  When I read the last chapter - I just could not believe it ended and was so glad to have the 2nd book there ready to read.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game has the vintage invader look and feel which bring back fun memories. Interface is nice and easy. All that and oh wait.. There's more: pong interleaved in the game! How cool is that? Captivating game, I must say..
B001NOQI3U|5.0|Great classic performance by Barbra.  Nice storyline.  Great singing.  Watched years ago and had to see it again.  Love this movie.
B00AF6B2BK|5.0|I don't know what we ever saw in tapes or cds, because there is no better way to listen to music than vinyl.  (live is the best but we all can't go to the concerts)
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I received it when I was supposed to.  I want to know why it's not at the video store?  That's why I decided to try and buy it.
B0027MJU00|1.0|I have finished about 25% of this book and I don't think I will ever finish it. The main character who survived the murder of her mother and two sisters is totally unsympathetic. No empathy for Libby Day. The story also seems to drag. The good news is I loaned it from the library so no waste of money on this trash.<br />Can't understand the 4 star overall rating.<br />I know I haven't finished and some would say that I shouldn't write a review then but some books like some movies are so bad that they can't be finished.
B001CU1RRM|5.0|I Imagined Myself In Michael Jackson's Concert With So Many Hours Of Beautiful Music!!! You Should Get This CD For Ur Collection!!!<br />You Won't Be Disappointed, Trust Me!!!
B0042XA2U4|3.0|Good book overall. Kind of slow at some points. Much better than the movie, focus more on the list insteadof the main characters love interest
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Love this game, so much fun.:-) It has great controls and is very entertaining. I reccomend it highly.  Breast fun, really:-)
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|(originally written for Sputnikmusic)<br /><br />Life is never easy being JT. He sings, he acts, he constantly is featured in GQ. The ladies want him, the guys want to be him. He took 7 years off from singing to become an established actor, and some of the performances he's given (The Social Network in particular) are just stellar. So when he announces that a new album is on the way, it's hard not to be even the slightest bit enthusiastic. Whereas artists like Rihanna pump out albums every year that seem to adhere to the same formula with little to no change, one look at the track listing for The 20/20 Experience shows he's got some ambition up his sleeve.<br /><br />Since I've gotten the album, I've listened to it three times. I know it's one that will have to grow on me, as his previous effort FutureSex/LoveSounds set the bar admittedly soaringly high, But I'm still not feeling it yet. It has sort of grown on me a bit, but I'm still not quite... used to it. For one, it sounds startlingly different from the previous album, whereas his previous album had a more upbeat, power-RnB sound to it, this sounds like more of a throwback to the 90s (but thankfully as far away from N*SYNC as possible!). And the songs do exceed 5 minutes in length- which is a bold move for pop music. In this day and age where people are used to their pop songs being a maximum of 4 minutes long, this album flirts with progressive territory. And in a way, I do admire Timberlake for trying to make an album that is meant to be listened to front to back, just like in the old days.<br /><br />To be fair, none of the songs are particularly bad- they're all very enjoyable. Despite the mixed reviews, &#34;Suit And Tie&#34; really does represent the album perfectly- there's lots of balance between upbeat and slow. The song itself is a fun listen- there's an air of old time class to it, with a mix of retro sounds of the sixties and the newer, hip hop sounds of today. Jay-Z proves himself to be yet again, the coolest rapper alive- with his middle section rap that adds a lot to the song. Perhaps the highlight of the album is &#34;Don't Hold The Wall&#34;- 7 minutes of pure energy with a tribal sound, and a catchy chorus that sometimes sounds dark. This song will sure tear up the dance floor on dance competition shows worldwide- at times it bears resemblance to &#34;Pass that Dutch&#34; by Missy Elliot. One particular part that's very interesting, and I'm surprised not many people have mentioned this yet- at 4:04, a sample from &#34;Steel Dream&#34; from Cirque du Soleil's Quidam can be heard- it adds to the eerie atmosphere of the song. &#34;That Girl&#34; is a fun song with backup from a Motown choir. It's catchy, upbeat, and deserves to be a hit. &#34;Mirrors&#34; is a song that's the definition of a hit- a catchy hook, an irresistible vintage Timberlake beat and excellent lyrics. The guitar riff is very much an ear worm, and it's nigh impossible to get out of your head. And, of course, it's not hard to see why everyone loves &#34;Blue Ocean Floor&#34; so much- it's so beautiful, ethereal, at times downright creepy. It brings to mind Madonna's &#34;Falling Free&#34; from last year's MDNA, which has that same atmospheric air. The effects the song uses really add a sense of eeriness.<br /><br />Also, anyone who lives in Canada gets the two bonus tracks- &#34;Dress On&#34;, well, it's easy to see why it's nothing more than a mere &#34;bonus track&#34;. It's catchy, but it's easy to see why it's left off the US version of the album. However, &#34;Body Count&#34; is a simple must-hear. It sounds a bit like &#34;Like I Love You&#34; with a Spanish flavour to it too. It's definitely a song that shouldn't have been left off- it is danceable and could have been known as an instant classic.<br /><br />However, the one complaint I have about this album is a big one- it's WAY TOO LONG. I get that Timberlake was trying to make an &#34;album&#34; instead of a collection of tracks, but its sheer scope- while impressive, also makes it a chore to listen to at times as well. &#34;Pusher Love Girl&#34; is the first track and an indication of things to come a the song ends at 5 minutes, but then there's a 3 minute coda that goes on and on and drags the song out. It really isn't necessary and takes away from the track. &#34;Strawberry Bubblegum&#34; both takes forever to begin (seriously, get rid of that &#34;this song is for you&#34; part) and to end. The entire second half of the song adds nothing to it. Mind you, I love long songs. They feel like adventures, if done right, and a number of bands I love have mostly songs that exceed the eight minute mark. But since a lot of stuff happens in the song, they feel way shorter. This isn't the case with The 20/20 Experience- at a lot of times, you think the songs are over, but they keep on going. This really is a shame, because all of the songs are good at worst, but have potential to be great. There are a few songs that benefit from the long lengths (like &#34;Tunnel Vision&#34;, &#34;Don't Hold the Wall&#34;, &#34;Blue Ocean Floor&#34;), but trim down the album and you have a way better album.<br /><br />It really is nice to have JT back. He's truly a visionary of pop music, and it's hard not to have respect for him, he sure knows how to deliver a good tune and get the people dancing. And while this is an acceptable return to form, itncould be better. It is nice to have a pop &#34;album&#34; instead of how pop albums usually are nowadays, but there's a lot of ways it could be better. Still, I'd take it over garbage like Nicki Minaj and Lil Wayne, so he's doing a good job in some way, at least.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD THESE TRACKS<br />-That Girl<br />-Blue Ocean Floor<br />-Don't Hold The Wall<br />-Body Count, but its sheer scope- while impressive, also makes it a chore to listen to at times as well. &#34;Pusher Love Girl&#34; is the first track and an indication of things to come a the song ends at 5 minutes, but then there's a 3 minute coda that goes on and on and drags the song out.

B0067TQQI8|5.0|The Anker dual USB 8400mAh external battery pack performs and saves your day great when you need it. It charges with a micro-USB cord which is supplied but you supply the wall adapter. It charges twice as fast with a 2amp wall charger. I got the Naztech N321-11655 Dual USB 3-in-1 Charger here at Amazon and it works to charge the Anker battery or your cell phone also. When you need to charge your phone or tablet just hook your device with the variety of charging cables supplied. It comes with original a mini-USB, micro-USB, and a 32 pin apple adapter but not the iphone5 Lightening connector...<br />It has a bright LED light to help you see if the power is off. You can choose from one of 2 USB ports offering  both 1Amp or 2Amp output. It charges my iphone5 from 30% to 100% in 40min...I'd recommned the 8400Amp or the 10000Amp model to charge 3 phones or a tablet and a phone when you need it. The battery comes with a nice protective pouch and 18 month warranty...

B002GHIPYI|5.0|For someone on a tight budget i think the HD 681's are going to be tough to beat. They fit over<br />my large head just as well as they do over my wife's not so large head. Yes, an on-cord volume<br />control would be nice but that would add to the cost and it's far from a deal breaker. It's the sound<br />most of us care about when we purchase headphones and that's where i feel these headphones<br />really shine. When you factor in the price i can't think of too many improvements Superlux can, or<br />should, make to this model. They sound great, don't look too bad and are VERY affordable so that<br />only leaves how they hold up over time as something i'm not 100% sure of.<br /> My older brother is ordering a pair of 681's for himself and my wife is hinting around for me to get<br />a second  pair just for her. so i guess we're happy!

B005C0DHEY|5.0|I work in the wastewater treatment field and recognized many chemicals named in the movie that are used in the fracking process that also used to treat wastewater. We have to take precautions around these dangerous chemicals at the waste treatment plant and some of the chemicals named in the movie are so bad we would never even use them in the wastewater treatment process. Many of the chemicals used in the fracking process belong in a lab and in a lab only. I am skeptical that there would be so many 1 star reviews of this movie and also noticed a pattern among the reviews recommending a pro-fracking movie that I will not name. Fracking threatens everything, environment, food, animals and our children. Fracking needs to be stopped before its too late.

It also lets the reader in on the day-to-day life of the typical Seal, something that we all should be able to relate to.

I find it to be a great album in respect to all of what has been on the top 40 for the past decade. Music needs growth to survive. and sometimes going back in time to grow is what makes it great. for me, the radiohead sound of blue ocean floor. and mixture of groovy dance tunes like strawberry bubblegum, and tunnel vision. make this an album. not to be picked through like a bunch of the pop artists albums are. listen to it from the beginning. and enjoy.

B000FS9FCG|5.0|What can anyone do in the face of true tyranny? When simple criticism is outlawed, what chance does a revolution have? How do you inspire a nation that's been bullied into silence?<br /><br />  The story begins with a comment on the power of an individual idea. Additionally, we are given a brief history of a failed rebellion in Great Britain and the man behind it, Guy Fawkes (portrayed by Clive Ashborn). Next, we flash-forward to an unspecified point in the United Kingdom's future. A future in which a man by the name of Lewis Prothero (called The Voice of London and played by Roger Allam) has his own nightly broadcast and uses it to espouse his own political beliefs which always ends with the phrase \\"good guys win, bad guys lose, and, as always, England prevails\\". Prothero is shown to the viewer on two different screens being watched by two different people. One of them, Evey Hammond (portrayed by Natalie Portman) is preparing for an evening out and turns off her television as she leaves, saying \\"That's quite enough of that. Thank you very much.\\" The other viewer is left unidentified. Once Hammond has left her home, a public address system notifies the citizenry that a \\"yellow coded\\" curfew is now in effect. Worried that she might face consequences if she is discovered, Hammond suddenly hurries. Unfortunately, she is accosted by two men. Soon after threatening her, they identify themselves as government officials and make it clear that they intend to assault her. All seems lost for Ms. Hammond until a masked man, (voiced by Hugo Weaving) intervenes on her behalf. Our man in the mask subdues Ms Hammond's attackers and then tells her that she may call him V. V claims to be a musician on the way to a concert and asks Evey to join him. V appears delusional to Evey at first, conducting a symphony that she can neither see nor hear, when the same public address system that informed of the curfew begins playing Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. Before the song is finished, she is surprised again by an explosion which destroys the Old Bailey, home of the Central Criminal Court and an iconic piece of London architecture. As V revels in the destruction of the Old Bailey, it becomes clear to Evey that he was responsible and as government officials observe her next to V in the surveillance footage, they incorrectly assume Evey was somehow involved.<br /><br />  When V for Vendetta was first in theaters, it was the source of much debate. Fans of the graphic novel complained that it took liberties with the story. Others worried that it justified terrorism. Having not read the graphic novel, I can't comment on the first part. On the second part, at the time it occurred, people might've seen the Boston Tea Party as terrorism. In a totalitarian state, where dissent is a criminal act in and of itself, terrorism might very well be the best vehicle for change. And it's because of that, an engaging and suspenseful story, and stellar performances from the main and supporting cast that I count V for Vendetta among my favorite movies. I have seen it many times since it was released on DVD and I will, no doubt, watch it many more. If what I've written intrigues you at all and you haven't seen this film yet, you absolutely should. Just one man's opinion.s surprised again by an explosion which destroys the Old Bailey, home of the Central Criminal Court and an iconic piece of London architecture.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|The first 40% of the book could have been skipped entirely.  It appeared that the author was simply trying to fill space with irrelevant and often repeated information.

I recommend a very fast read for the first few chapters and then settle in to a very good and different story.

B00BEZTMFY|3.0|ACTUAL RATING: 3.5 or maybe 3.75<br /><br />*Quick Note: I haven't read The Hobbit, so I'm not exactly comparing it to the book. I have read summaries of the novel though (yes, I know, I'm a cheater), so I'm going off of th<br /><br />The Hobbit isn't a bad movie. It honestly isn't. It was definitely one of my favorite movies from 2012. But it just wasn't quite what it could have been. And to answer the question of \\"Is The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings better?\\" In my opinion, Lord of the Rings is the better movie.<br /><br />Now, there's a lot of good stuff in this movie, don't get me wrong.<br /><br />The acting is fantastic. Martin Freeman IS Bilbo. You do not doubt for one second that he is Bilbo. In a lot of ways, I found him to be more likable than Frodo (who I still like as a character, but, well, that's a different story.) Freeman is just endearing as the unassuming hobbit from Bag End. Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis reprise their roles as Gandalf and Gollum, respectively. To no one's surprise, they do great. They are every bit as good as they were in The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />The dwarves are the ensemble here, the way the Fellowship was in the first Lord of the Rings movie. We only really get to know Thorin as a character as far as the dwarves go. And I must say, Richard Armitage does an admirable job playing the conflicted Thorin Oakenshield. As for the other dwarves, they all did a nice job in their roles and were entertaining to watch, despite the fact that we only get glimpses of their character here and there. (And not to mention, there are some very attractive dwarves.)<br /><br />There are also some very well-done scenes in the movie. I enjoyed the scene where the dwarves all crash at Bilbo's house. Personally, I think it conveyed the fun, lighter tone the movie was trying to get across (more on that later.) It's a nice insight into Bilbo's characters and a nice way to meet the dwarves.<br /><br />The riddles scene with Gollum was great. I loved the humor that was thrown in here and there, but that the scene was also creepy and had some tension. It was interesting to see Gollum in a different light. You almost pitied him when Bilbo took the ring and almost kiled him.<br /><br />The beginning scene with Bilbo and Frodo was a nice addition. It was short, but it was a nice shout-out to the LotR trilogy. While Frodo seemed incredibly thin and pasty (maybe it was just me), it was sort of...chilling to see him pre-Ring. I know that sounds like a bizarre way to put it, but seeing him before his journey seemed strange and kind of sad. The whole time he was on screen I was just thinking about what was to come for him.<br /><br />Middle-Earth looks gorgeous. There seems to be more CGI this time, but still, it looks beautiful.<br /><br />And I can't mention what I liked about the movie without mentioning the music. Howard Shore has done another great job with the score for this film. The movie captures the simplicity of Hobbit life, the tension of thte battle scenes, and everything in between. The Misty Mountains song is lovely. It just sounds like it came straight out of Middle Earth.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite the great acting, the music, and some well-done scenes, The Hobbit had its flaws.<br /><br />There were a lot of little things that botherd me about the movie. I thought the Goblin King was incedibly silly and didn't look menacing at all. He just looked digusting. I was hoping they would go the \\"Orc Route\\" with the Goblin King and make him look creepy and hellish, not goofy and over-the-top gross. His one line, \\"Well, that will do it!\\"...eh, n'mind. I'm not going to get into that.<br /><br />Radagast was also unnecessarily silly. While I've never read the books, if I remember correctly, he is supposed to be as powerful as Gandalf (**but I could be wrong about that**). And while he may be a little nutty, this movie just took it too far. His rabbit-pulled sled was ridiculous and the fact that he had bird poop in his hair did him no favors. I mean, really, I'm supposed to think THIS guy is as powerful as Gandalf?<br /><br />The film's two biggest issues, however, are the pacing and the tone.<br /><br />I feel like this movie couldn't quite decide what audience it wanted to appease the most. \\"The Hobbit\\" was written as a children's book, so I wasn't expecting this to have the dark, sometimes grim tone the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" film trilogy had. However, with this movie, there were a couple moments that seemed pretty dark. The movie appeared to want to try to sort of \\"age\\" the story, if you will, to appeal to more of the adult LotR/Hobbit fans. And yet, we have things like wizards with bird poop in their hair and overly grotesque goblin kings and just cheap humor. The movie does have its moments of more mature humor that works, but not many. And this isn't to say it didn't need humor, but it didn't do it well. \\"Lord of the Rings\\" had much better, subtle humor when it was needed. The film seemed to be trying to strike the balance between being mature enough for adult viewers, while still being good for the kids, and unfortunately, it didn't quite hit the mark.<br /><br />Then there's the pacing. As I'm sure everyone knows, \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is only part one of what is going to be a three-part series. Unfortunately, the source material is only about 280 pages (at least my copy is.) Needless to say, the pacing of this film suffers. Since there are still have two more three-hour-long movies to fill, the scenes here feel very long. The movie only covers about five or six chapters of the book, I believe. There are several times in this movie where it feels overly looooong. The fight scene with the goblins felt long. The beginning, while I liked it for introducing us to the dwarves, was long. There were just quite a few times where the movie dragged and the tension was pretty much lost.<br /><br />So, \\"The Hobbit\\" isn't a terrible film. It's enjoyable. The acting's great, it has some good scenes, and the music is amazing. But it suffers from pacing and tone and it definitely isn't as good as Lord of the Rings.oop in his hair did him no favors.

B003LQ3YXU|3.0|Didn't click with this Dr so much, love Rose. That is all I can think of that needs to be written.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is an awesome game that doesnt bombard you with ads and pop ups even though its free. Addictive gameplay and surprisingly easy controls. Definitely worth checking put!
B003JUGQ38|4.0|My favorite Dr, good and fun. Not my favorite cohort. They want more words but I am all done writing.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I love Glee, and I enjoyed each episode. I was thrilled to watch the episodes that I missed during season 1.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Wow!  What a page turner!  So many twists and turns - you think you have it all figured out then Grisham puts in another angle to consider.  Excellent book - I 've recommended this to several friends.  I think this is one of Grisham's best!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It was an absolute amazing game, it quizzes your knowledge, it's fun, challenging, I think you should buy this game if you're looking for some fun.
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|I first heard \\"Oblivion\\" on The Vampire Diaries and wanted it so badly, but could not find it anywhere other than youtube.  I kept searching, hoping it would eventually become available.  Finally, I got my wish.  I'm the kind of person that listens to samples from the entire CD before purchasing just one song, because a lot of the time I will like other songs on the album.  When I listened to just samples off of \\"Bad Blood\\", I was extremely intrigued.  I bought this for 18 dollars...quite steep for a 12 track album these days but I do NOT regret it one bit.  You know how with a lot of CD's, you have your favorite tracks and you sometimes skip others to hear that one?  I cannot bear to skip anything on this!  I love all of them so much, I haven't taken the CD out of my car's player since the day it arrived in the mail.  I also listen to it on my mp3 player while cooking or riding my bike.  Basically, I cannot stand to not listen to this it is so amazing.  It is unique also, which is refreshing in a world of copycats as far as music goes.  I have zero complaints about \\"Bad Blood\\", and I wish it would catch on in the US...but then again, I rather enjoy being part of a smaller audience anyway.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I would have given a 5 if they had not killed off Mathew at the end....why not just find a new person to play Mathew? So what if Lee Stevens wanted to leave....the accident could have left him disfigured to explain the new look. They need to fix this before season 4 starts or they could lose some of their audience....me included.
B000SW2F6M|2.0|i was really disappointed because i couldnt watch the film because the movie on amazon was not good virtually and the sound effect was also bad.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I enjoyed this movie! I thought it was pretty funny. I was a little disappointed it didn't really tie into knocked up; I thought Seth Rogan and Katherine hiegle would be in a least one scene but they weren't. All in all a very good movie though.
B00BF11STU|3.0|I was really looking forward to this considering the Oscar nods.  Honestly, I thought it was a little boring!  Even the scenes with the Seals!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|fun and you don't want to stop playing it. it just takes a while to unlock another shark but it rocks!
B0064W65UM|5.0|Re-reading V again after a break of some years, I was pleased to see how well it holds up. There are signs of its age but they don't diminish the overall effect much, which in the wake of the London riots and the growing fascist tendencies in the west remains chilling.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great update to the holmes saga, I really like that they use the original stories in a modern context.. so if your a fan of the books or original movies (Basil Rathbone) the you will like how you think you know the plot but the twists are new so it maintains your interest..
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|I've always like Helen Hunt and I know how difficult it is for women of a 'certain age' to get work.  Bravo to Helen for making her own movies and keeping her face in front of us.  The only one that doesn't seem to have that problem is Meryl Streep!
B00095NX9G|5.0|As an experienced dancer, this was my first belly dancing DVD and it really inspired me to delve into this as a hobby!  I can't even tell you how many times I've done the isolation section!  It emphasized posture and form and fools you into thinking that you already are a belly dancer.  The shimmy drill is ridiculous.  It's fun just to watch, but if you're willing to practice you'll be able to get through it eventually.  The combinations are nice- they get you thinking about layering.  Though I love yoga and do this as a separate exercise session, I wish it was a little shorter for a warm-up and cooldown.  My only other complaint is that there are a couple of synching problems that last a couple seconds each- definitely not a deal-breaker, especially if you are looking at the quality of content and education as number 1.  I've owned this for three months now and this DVD has definitely helped by flexibility (especially in my back and shoulders), my overall posture and my confidence in my ability to do the basic movements of belly dance.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Rothfuss' writing skills have improved considerably since Name of the Wind. He takes more risks, provides more variety, and trusts the reader more. The result is a powerful and engaging novel that I would rank among the all-time best in the genre of high fantasy.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|The author clearly did I his homework. I disliked the other stories.  He should've focused exclusively on Chris.<br />Saw the movie first and recommend that too.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|A novel that's both light-hearted and unconventional, a bit like Umberto Eco but with Star Trek rather than history as the reference point.<br /><br />The tone of the novel changes noticeably as it progresses, so you're likely to either like the early parts better than the latter ones, or vice-versa.
B008602KQI|5.0|We received this DVD in record time. Which was great because I really wanted to see it. It's a great movie.
0380807343|4.0|Not my usual fare, but a compelling \\"fairy tale\\"...more endearing to children than adults.<br /><br />Frankly, I didn't know what to expect, but needed to read this for a book group discussion.<br /><br />Young Coraline is indeed a very brave young heroine, empowered and very clever in the face of what the dangers are and lurk furtively in fairy tales!  Young readers will find the adaptation to a two-dimensional situation easier to digest than an older, less flexible reader where the blurred realities are more burdensome.<br /><br />\\"Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.\\"<br /><br />I expect that my children would have loved hearing me read this to them when they were younger...I mean when you can actually talk to a cat with attitude...how cool is that?<br /><br />\\"What's your name,' Coraline asked the cat. 'Look, I'm Coraline. Okay?'<br />'Cats don't have names,' it said.<br />'No?' said Coraline.<br />'No,' said the cat. 'Now you people have names. That's because you don't know who you are. We know who we are, so we don't need names.\\"<br /><br />Some reviewers have shelved this novella in their \\"horror\\" category, but that is not at all what I experienced!<br />I allowed my `inner child' to peek behind the mirror and fall through the \\"rabbit (rodent) hole!\\"

B007712XAU|5.0|My wife began watching the series in it's third year and realized she's missed out on a lot of the back story.  So I ordered Seasons 1 & 2.  Delivered quickly.  And the quality of the discs are excellent.  My wife enjoyed every minute.

B000N6UERK|4.0|High action film with a sci-fi twist that I did not exspect. Decent movie for when nothing on tv, sournd sounds great.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Everything in this musical positively drew it together to really pay homage to how epic the story is: The monumentally talented actors, the swooping musical score, and the haunting realism and historical significance of it all, combined with truly amazing sets and costume, make for a film that you will want to watch back to front over and over again... and I have done.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|What can you say? EXCELLENT entertainment and acting.  I'm a fan. This is always a truly entertaining  series when you have friends over that want to watch something a bit strange and out of the ordinary!

1457514508|3.0|From its title, \\"The Gordonstown Ladies Dog Walking Club\\" might promise to be one of those cosy little mysteries filled with eccentric characters.  Instead, the present novel turns out to be quite something else, much more hard-edged than the title might suggest.  The chielf limitation of the book, in my opinion, is the heavy reliance upon coincidence to drive the plot.  Virtually everything that happens is the results of a series of never-ending coincidences.  I am perfectly willing to suspend disbelief for some good coincidence to start the gears turning, but a series of such coincidences to keep things moving is just too much.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"Changeling\\" staring Angelina Jolie and directed by Clint Eastwood. The movie was loosely based on a true kidnapping and murder case coming out of Los Angeles in the mid-1920s. As such, I found this period piece to be just amazing. The film was date-marked from place to place from the mid-20s to the mid-30s and the scenery always fit the time. How do they ever do it? Where do they get all those magnificent old cars and  trucks? Where do they get Los Angeles street-rail cars and even the rails on the streets to operate them?And how do they get rid of all the normal traffic and people? I could go on and on. It's amazing! Kudos to those in charge of the sets!<br /><br />The story had a powerful impact on me. I might indicate that I'm the father of a 4 1/2-year-old boy and this story would be a parent's worst nightmare. I thought that it lacked credibility here and there. Okay, a young boy was kidnapped and gone for six months. Then the police said they found him in a mid-west state and shipped him back to Los Angeles. Well, Jolie took one look and knew it wasn't her boy. What parent wouldn't? I mean, he was three inches shorter than her boy, he was circumcised and her boy wasn't and there were all sorts of other things that just didn't fit. Yet, the story goes on and she's locked up in a mental ward for disagreeing with the police identification. Really? Can this kind of incompetence and/or total corruption really happen? Well, surely not in this  day and age.<br /><br />Then, of course, they finally find a chicken ranch where about 20 boys were murdered. The killer is caught, tried, sentenced and, ultimately hanged for the murders. It's a gripping story and very well done. The acting is excellent. I found no dull moment, yet the film seemed overly long. Was it really necessary to drag out  some of the scenes to such a degree? Well, it was an excellent movie, without question and I think my quibbles are just minor. I'd give it 4.5 stars, but I have no way to do that so rounding it up to 5 seems  fair.<br /><br />Gary Petersonars, but I have no way to do that so rounding it up to 5 seems  fair.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B009O07NMA|4.0|This was a bit of an impulse buy.  I heard a couple of the songs on this album on satellite radio and couldn't help but sing along after hearing them a couple of times.  The new auto-rip feature cinched the deal because when you do the math, you get two albums for the price of one.  All in all a great album with some very catchy music.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Never have I laughed or agreed more with a book. Perfect mixture of Gaiman's love of mythology with Pratchett's ability to turn the serious, ridiculous. You'll never look at religion the same!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Couldn't put this one down. It isn't deep, not even necessarily believable -- but very entertaining and a good read.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|I'd heard such rave reviews about this book I couldn't wait to read it so I jumped at the offer of a friend's e-reader with this ebook. I hate to say it but I was disappointed. As some others have said the story being told from the viewpoint of a 5 year old throughout the whole novel was a little tiresome. The escape itself was a bit far-fetched & I found a lot of it wasn't realistic. I liked the grandmother & step-grandfather. They were probably the better characters in the story. The way they were treated after they got out just didn't ring true to me. I don't think they would have been able to have as much control over the situation - ie. staying in the clinic for weeks without any interference, etc if such a thing happened in today's world. The mother checking up on her friend's on FB & emailing them after 7 years is a bit unbelievable to me too. How would she remember P/W's or even know about FB? So while I did read the entire book & definitely found it interesting, it really didn't meet my expectations.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was very interesting.  I am quite the animal lover so it was hard to stomach the horrible slaughter.  It was a sad and tragic story, but I still enjoyed it.  Would not want to see the movie however (too graphic).
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|As a Dr Who fan I stumbled onto this series and absolutely love it. Does get a bit gory at times but story line of saving earth from aliens is a good one. Set in modern times but travels to past  and future. Cast is yummy and interaction very good. Highly recommend after watching all of the Who series.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|I really wasn't sure how good the quality would be streaming this movie from Amazon.  Much to my chagrin it was outstanding!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was quite a page turner ... I felt like I was actually hearing them speak to me.  Lots of twists and turns.  I just wasn't sure I was happy with the ending although I understood it.
B000031WBV|5.0|What can be said that already has not been said.  This is a rich, wonderful recording (2 CDs) with quality ewngineering. I was fortunate to have met Mr. Rubinstein in a concert in New York.  His control over the keyboard in the recording is excellent and he delivers the true Chopin sensitivity.  A well worth purchase.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I find this game test my memory and I like that.  Some of the towers takes a few time to master and I like that too
B007QSNMS6|4.0|I found the book to be inspirational and full of candid information that can be applied in everyday creative work.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Pi Patel tells the extraordinary tale of his surviving a shipwreck to a writer. By the end, you will wonder which parts were literally true and which were symbolic or metaphorical.  The young actor playing Pi on the lifeboat is especially moving, as are the scenes with the tiger.  Great visual effects and a spiritual journey.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I can't find rules for this.  I love Bingo, but not when I don't understand how to play.  It says Free, but tells me I have to by B's.  I ran out of them and now it won't let me play.  I also don't understand how to collect the symbols.  Oh well.
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|If I say that this adaptation could've been much better, it gives a misleading impression that it wasn't excellent, but it was!  The story and animation was very close to that of the graphic novel, and the overall movie was extremely enjoyable.  I did, however, not like the way they left out the internal monologues, which I thought added a lot to the characterisations in the book.  I wonder if they did it because of memories of the negative reactions to the voice-over in Bladerunner, or if it was just an artistic decision. Either way, it was a bad idea.<br /><br />I was also a bit disappointed with the casting - Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill have built incredible identities as the voices of Batman and the Joker, and in this version they are sorely missed.  Peter Weller has a great voice but it just isn't 'heroic' enough, and Michael Emerson as the Joker doesn't seem quite as maniacally joyous in his mischief.<br /><br />These criticisms are really just the fussing of an obsessed fan.  I enjoyed the movie(s) immensely, and would recommend them to everyone!
B004YXE438|5.0|Lots of fun playing this.  Started on medium, which was a challenge.  Pictures are vibrant, colorful to play with repeatedly.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|This is a cool game! Whatever was the problem with the kindle fire hd, has been fixed. Downloaded on kindle fire hd and works great. Fun action game!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't get enough of the Walking Dead series. Season three is a bit of a shift in the story, being more about people vs. people. The &#34;bad guy&#34; is wonderfully played, smart and kind of scary. The main cast is as awesome as before, but with more grit and intensity. If you're a fan of the series, my guess is you will love season three also.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|Sometimes Hollywood makes a good movie with content, and thus without the need for comercial sex appeal. The story was writen by Victor Hugo. I thought Amanda was a decent actress, until I found out about the other indecent movies she made.

B002MUAJ2A|5.0|A good book, summarizing business practices in a dynamic, but economically conservative software business. Good to see how mid decade advice stands up to the test of time, as some of its notable peers have stumbled.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|I loved a comedy not geared to high school or early 20s crowd. It is for all us late 30- early 40 people.<br />It is funny and worth a watch, but not so funny you pee.

B0017M413M|4.0|I am a fan of the Stargate series. I enjoyed the movie for the story and how it tied in to the regular series at the time. It's a good watch for anyone who knows the series although might be tough to follow without prior understanding of the good guy and bad guy roles.
B008OOYALE|2.0|I mean this game was alright but it's pretty much just a total rip off of dragonvale. It's an ok game
B000OIZUW6|5.0|Great book. I love Follett and he didn't let me down. Fast paced, interesting characters and a good read. If you loke Follett, read it!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I'm a writer so, I know what it must have taken to create this. Life of Pi is, without question, one of the best books I have ever read. Martel cuts us loose from reality with a sharp, sudden blade and takes us for a ride through a starry universe of suffering and wonder in the company of a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Before you open the cover or switch on your Kindle: clear the next two days, turn on the answering machine and forget Twitter and Email - because you won't want to stop reading.<br />The film, by Ang Lee, in 3D, will change you forever.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I enjoy this type of movie and it has alot of graphic stuff in it so I would not recommend it for children
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|great geats really addicting after the first few minutes. I recommended it for times when u need a break from a hard day.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very enjoyable, could play for hours at a time without getting bored. Difficult enough for a challenge but not frustratingly so.
B005S9EKCW|2.0|This latest production of Les Miserables just wasn't very good.  It obviously has high production value.  It's visually fantastic, but it's an operetta with really substandard musical performances.  The music from Les Mis has always stood out as some of the most powerful and moving in musical theatre.  This latest version utterly fails to live up to that legacy.  Russel Crow's performance is especially bad.  If you love the music, you may want to give this one a miss.
1780540574|4.0|I bought this for my granddaughter who loves JB.  It is substantial in size and the lunch tote is a nice plus.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I was very pleased with this purchase.  The quality is great and It was just as it was pictured online.  The packaging it was shpped in protected the product and was the appropriate size for the item.  I would reccomend this product.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|i'm enjoying it a great deal. not sure I have the right reflexes! you really have to move fast with the signals and switches. I like the graphics of the crashes and the tumbling cows make me laugh.<br /><br />Update: on my Kindle Fire, there are places in the game that go \\"off the board\\" and are impossible to play.  It's not as responsive to touch either. I finally deleted it without playing it all the way through since some parts of it are off screen and impossible to play. There are also times when I believe a bigger screen would help you make the switches. There are a couple of levels where on the smaller screen the trains hit their switches at apparently the same time. Perhaps a bigger screen would show a difference, but I was unable to pass the level because of not being able to go between the two switches so close together in space and time. I wanted to like this game, but it just doesn't work on my KF.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun and engaging. I haven't been playing long, but I suspect the &quot;training&quot; will get a bit tiresome, hence the lack of 5 stars (at least for the time being).
B003TH14H4|5.0|I think this is one of the best series I have seen  in a long time. The cast is great.
030758836X|1.0|I won't spoil it by giving the details, but I will say, it's a slow start, a fire-hot middle, and an anticlimactic, non-existent, dead end. I wish I could get back every minute I spent reading this book!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I hate that I have to wait for the next book, but I absolutely loved this installment. I love the style, the substance and the incredible depth of the story.
B0042RUMIW|4.0|The first six songs out of the gate are simply fantastic.  Tracks like &#34;Russians&#34; (which borrows from Prokofiev) suddenly make complete sense.  Never one of my favorite Sting pieces, it comes to life on this disc.  The symphony orchestra is top notch and Sting's arrangements are very good.  Sting is in great vocal form and he looks good to boot.<br />I like when artists perform deep tracks rather than just the hits, and here is where the DVD can be confounding.  It sags in the middle when Sting chooses deep tracks that are simply not his best material (&#34;Cowboy Song&#34; &#34;I Hung My Head&#34; &#34;Moon Over Bourbon Street&#34; &#34;My Ain True Love&#34; come to mind).  Even my wife, a hardcore Sting fan, drew the same conclusion.<br />Thankfully Sting recovers and the show gains steam once again and finishes strong.The orchestra and band never falter.  Sting puts his bass guitar down early in the show, but I didn't really miss it as the bass player in the band was very good.
B001MLEW2S|1.0|I found myself laughing at the horrific acting and forcing myself to keep watching just to see how bad the whole thing was. TERRIBLE. Not one of Wes Cravens better moments.

048629823X|5.0|I first read the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius as teen over 35 years ago, thought it was interesting and thought-provoking...and then moved on, as teenagers are wont to do, to other, newer things. Re-reading the Meditations as a 50-something woman with much more life experience behind me gives me a new perspective and many more ways to apply these ideas to my life. You know it's worth paying attention, when the personal, journal-style musings of an ancient Roman emperor strike home, and resonate with, the mind and heart of an ordinary woman living in 21st Century America. The introduction is short, and well worth reading for it's clear explanations of the man, his times, and background: also, what Stoicism actually is, and is not (surprising for me, who foolishly thought she already knew) Highly recommended.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Worst Movie Ever Seen:<br /><br />This was a total waste of everyone's time and effort to produce this movie.  This movie could qualify as the worst movie of all time that was ever produced.  I love Keira, but she could not pull this off and save this monstrosity.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Downloaded onto my kindle hd fire. I love this app as it shows you how much the battery has charged,how much music,reading,browsing time is left.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Very good but too expensive. It's kinda worth it though.<br />And it should've said what happened to Mr Duffy too
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Just got the bluray combo pack from Amazon a couple of days back and what I saw was truly amazing. The movie is a pleasure to behold. Set 60 years before the event in the fellowship of the ring, the epic functions as a perfect prequel to the three LOTR movies.<br />The video and audio are top notch and the locations taken in picturesque New Zealand are simply mind-boggling.<br />I think this is a must have for die hard LOTR fans and it pushes the franchise to even greater heights.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Not a very good Bane, sometimes the animated series are just better.  If you've watched all the other Dark Knight series then you might as well finish this one.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|I bought this along with a Swiss Tech tool. I like this one because it doesn't look like a tool or a knife. The blade meets TSA's announced exception to the \\"no knives\\" policy. We'll see. It will probably last until some overzealous TSAgent covet's it for him/herself, then they'll gin up some excuse why it has to be \\"confiscated.\\" Ah yes - TSA - the gift that keeps on giving.
B00ARAO720|5.0|I ride a road bike, and this is nothing like the way I ride.  Pretty suspenseful, cops are dooches, and all lanes are bike lanes.
B002E2QHBS|5.0|Great box set with the classic performances previously released but with enough unreleased material to be worth the purchase. Loved the Canned Heat uncut Woodstock Boogie.
0894803123|5.0|This book is a go-to book for making many flavors of ice cream, and I have made almost all of them.  I modified the sweet cream base recipe so that it is cooked as recommended in other reviews.<br /><br />For the Sweet Cream Base, simply cook the milk and cream on medium heat until hot stirring occasionally.  While you are doing this, beat the eggs and then add the sugar to the eggs.  Temper the egg mixture by adding one cup of the hot milk mixture.  Turn the heat on the milk mixture down to medium low, and then add the egg mixture while stirring constantly.  While stirring monitor the temperature with a thermometer until it reaches about 160F, and do not allow to boil.  Remove from heat and add your vanilla (or other flavoring).  Chill for several hours and then freeze as directed by your ice cream maker.<br /><br />For the chocolate ice cream recipes, I make them in a double boiler first melting the chocolate and then adding the milk while wisking until incorporated.  I heat the cream in a separate pan and use the cream to temper the egg mixture and then add it all to the double boiler until 160F.  Cooking it on a burner simply allowed the chocolate to separate from the rest of the mixture.<br /><br />The hot fudge recipe is excellent, and for the cookie dough I use Egg Beaters and butter.  Do not use margarine as the dough will not effectively hold up in your ice cream maker.  By far the best tasting ice cream recipes.  Buy the book now.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Great game. Loved hints. Only used 3 but great to have when totally stumped. Liked that had 3 separate adventures or chapters to story.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this is a really fun game. it kinds reminds you of like Mario kart but it is faster and crazier. I really enjoy playing this game! :)
160094048X|5.0|I can find most ingredients at the local grocery store or wal-mart, if not easily substituted products. I bought this for my vegan friend and we bake together. It doesn't inconvenience me at all and I'm not even vegan. The cookies are delicious, better than non-vegan cookies. The ooh-la-la's (oreos) are AMAZING

B0051XI9FO|5.0|Although we might think Miles Axlerod is a great guy in the Cars 2 movie at first, organizing the 3-country World Grand Prix race to show off his renewable, clean-burning fuel Allinol, he ends up being the one behind a secret plot to actually turn the world AGAINST alternative energy, and to instead rely heavily on traditional gas (since he and the &quot;Lemon&quot; families own the world's largest untapped oil reserves!)  He's designed as a green Range Rover L322, and his license plate is part of the scam (it says &quot;ALT NRG&quot;!)<br /><br />10/7/15 Update:  I'm adding the following couple of paragraphs strictly for the benefit of anyone considering starting a collection - don't spend any time on them if you're only looking for one or two of these diecasts.  When we started collecting Mattel's Cars 2 1:55 scale diecasts for our oldest grandson in early 2012, there were SO many choices when it came to singles... 50 &quot;numbered&quot; packages (along with 14 &quot;Deluxe&quot; numbered packages), &quot;Lights &amp; Sounds&quot;, &quot;Pit Stop Launchers&quot;, cars with &quot;synthetic rubber tires&quot; or &quot;metallic finish&quot;... and multi-packs to boot!  We were completely overwhelmed and confused.  Ended up deciding to stick with the &quot;numbered&quot; packages (probably a bit naive since - at least at that time - we might've found some better deals with the 2/3/4/5/7/10 or 12 packs, but you have to have a strategy if you go that route since there are so many duplications), along with the Super Chase models.  Then in November of that year, they started coming out with a bunch THEMED series, &quot;lenticular&quot; singles, etc... it's so easy to spend a small fortune (and we did!), so I'm glad we at least set the parameters for our collection early on before we got too sidetracked (and spent our retirement funds!)  We've had a couple of more grandsons since then, so we really feel it's been money well spent given the high level of durability of these small models and the enjoyment they get out of playing with them.  There are so many ways to collect, and obviously the more recent the releases, the more readily available (and more reasonable) you'll find them.<br /><br />For anyone who might be interested in knowing what those original &quot;numbered&quot; singles packages were, here's the (very long) list:  1) Race Team Mater, 2) Finn McMissile, 3) Lightning McQueen with Racing Wheels, 4) Francesco Bernoulli, 5) Holley Shiftwell, 6) Professor Z, 7) Jeff Gorvette, 8) Carla Veloso, 9) Raoul CaRoule, 10&amp;11 (together) Race Team Luigi &amp; Race Team Guido, 12) Acer, 13) Grem, 14) Race Team Fillmore, 15) Race Team Sarge, 16) Rod Torque Redline, 17) Miles Axlerod, 18) Petrov Trunkov, 19) Hydraulic Ramone, 20) Nigel Gearsley, 21) Max Schnell, 22) Shu Todoroki, 23) Miguel Camino, 24) Lewis Hamilton, 25) Carlo Maserati, 26) Hudson Hornet Piston Cup Lightning McQueen, 27) Mel Dorado, 28) Vladimir Trunkov, 29) Radiator Springs Ramone, 30) Victor H., 31) Don Crumlin, 32) Officer Murakarmi, 33) Becky Wheelin, 34) Acer with Torch, 35) Kabuto, 36) Rip Clutchgoneski, 37) Bindo, 38) Celine Dephare, 39) Erik Laneley, 40) Cartney Brakin, 41) Galloping Geargrinder, 42) Prince Wheeliam, 43) Otis, 44) Suki, 45) Alex Vandel, 46) Nick Cartone, 47) Fabrizio, 48) Alexander Hugo with Party Hat, 49) Mary Esgocar, 50) Sir Harley Gassup.

B004H6G0TI|5.0|My first game of this kind, quite simple, colorful. Game of the Week, liked it. The game is simple, but the &#34;addictive.&#34; The controls used quickly. I recommend.
B004I744AS|5.0|It's a wonderful learning tool. My favorite is the spelling bee.  You not only learn to spell properly, you learn the definition and sentence structure. Thank you!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a great game for both kids and adullts. Its teaches responsibility and patience. I just wish it was a little easier to earn coins and gems.
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|A Great movie, I only wish it didn't have as much hype as it did.  Still a solid LOTR project.
B007M45PMU|5.0|The Lumineers are an up and coming band out of Colorado. Their album is great to listen too and I look forward to more  from this group.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Great movie that builds up the Marvel base for future movies. Quality performances by undervalued actors. Not a must watch but pretty good movie especially if have an affinity for comic book movies.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|This is a very entertaining movie and a rapier-sharp political satire as a Palin-style presidency deals with an invasion of Nazis from the moon. While the premise is a wee bit ridiculous, the film never takes itself seriously enough for it to be a bother. If you trust the filmmakers and go along for the ride, you will find this movie is a lot of fun. It also has some of the best special effects I've ever seen in a European film not from Britain. I wish I had seen it in a theater on a big screen. This movie is well worth seeing in my opinion.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I like this movie a lot. It has its funny parts & it made me feel like a  kid again
B000VUCIZE|5.0|A logical look at faith and religion and its impact on our thoughts and actions.  The author shows great courage in 'telling it like it is'.<br />If we, as a species,  are to get along, survive and advance ourselves, we need to get off the religion opiate.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|My 9 year old son and I watched it times in the 48 hours we rented it!  I would recommend to anyone who likes their funny bone tickled, and heart strings pulled :)
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Good movie, I was kind of skeptical about watching this due to I can read the book in a day, and it is broken up into three movies. I was wrong. Very good story. lots of action, and an all in all great movie. Looking forward to the next 2!
0802473156|5.0|I wish I had read this book YEARS ago because it might have saved my marriage.  I'm separated from my husband but am reading it anyway because it's never too late to learn how to speak someone's love language.  I read this book in two days and then gave it to my husband to read.  I made notes in it and took the test for me.  I hope he sees that we were not communicating because we were not speaking the same language all these years.  It's a MUST HAVE book to read if you are married or if you are thinking of getting married or if you are having trouble in your marriage.  PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!  You will never regret it.
B009KUANWG|5.0|First I was disappointed that this track was NOT on the film soundtrack, But then again, it doesn't really matter since this is the one track that I really wanted. She deserved that Oscar.
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|This is a romantic and energetic CD simultaneously.  As usual, Bowie's lyrics make one ponder.  It is so wonderful to have him back making music!
B009MB682W|5.0|It was great to find these in one package! Track quality was great, plus they seemed to be in order!
B0091REZMW|4.0|It can get crazy expensive but addictive. Almost gave it up a few times but hung in. Kindle update FINALLY showed up yesterday and looks good. Still has slowdowns and freezing not to mention missing essentials like seahorses and pearls(!). Also lots of repetitives in what you receive after exploring rooms. Quests also take way too long. Key element is to have friends and reciprocated gifting. If you start follow discussions on FB&hellip;though some hints on there do not help Kindle users as the games are not the same as the FB and ipad versions. Close but not quite...don't know why but there it is. And have lots of patience.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Phenomenal book and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in books about self awareness and finding your purpose in life

B004MC8CA2|5.0|There is not greater book. The Bible stands alone as the word of God that changes and saves the heart, the mind, and the soul.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The cast is excellent. But do remember these are actors and a hundred years from now they may have actors portraying them. They are portraying what the writer believes and has researched what it was like in that time period. But it is good drama. Probably very close to reality in many ways. How did they get in the character mood?
B001LOPYHI|4.0|This is one of those classics that needs to be watched from time to time. Of course the costumes and hair styles are dated, and the &#34;special effects&#34; can't compare in scope and realism compared to what is the norm today .. but for the times, and what it was pretty darned good. The story is a good story and relevant even today.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It was an exciting movie. Do we really know what the story was? Did the hero ever go back to India? The hero seemed apart from the story at the end, yes it changed his life but he is still alive. Did he ever look up the island of trees he found out there?
B004MC0FO8|4.0|This app does exactly what it is supposed to do.What else can you ask from it.I would recommend it to everyone
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Really fun to play and easy to learn. The app was free which makes it even better. Fun to play.
B004XZR63M|3.0|Nothing to complain about. Classic reading that is as relevant today as the day it was written. Timeless advice on financial management and wealth building.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Too many descriptions seemed like the author was just trying to use up space skipped many parts and it was very predictable

B005F8CL1S|5.0|I did not know much about Leonard Cohen other than liking his songs that were on the soundtrack of 'Pump Up The Volume.' I listened to some of the teasers and decided to buy the collection. I am glad I did. LC is a really good songwriter and performer.
0316228532|5.0|New book, received promptly. Plot is not as gripping as Harry Potter, but solid. Reflects JK Rowlings experiences living in apartments prior to her success.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is the first book I ever read in my life. Been a crazy apple fan. And it prompted me to read the life of Steve. The way he inspired to bring out the best in people.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Yes, it's much more than your usual $.99 app, but this one holds your attention to the max. Everyone else I knew was playing it, and now I can see why they liked it so much.  I like it because in addition to entertaining, it allows you to be creative in development of your own world.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Truly a legend. I was inspired by his work, patriotism.. And so on.. Rip Chris..  You are never forgotten by the men behind you and front of you and so the readers like me..

B008Y6TD5A|4.0|I always wanted to watch The Next Three Days yet put off watching it for some other movie. One night that changed and I put it on. I watched it and liked it. I was pleased with the Amazon Instant Video streaming service. The audio and video was clear throughout.<br /><br />I like Russell Crowe. His performance in The Next Three Days was good. The supporting cast was good, too.<br /><br />I didn't know until recently that The Next Three Days was a remake of the French film Pour Elle (Anything for Her). American remakes are usually not very good nor better than the original foreign movies. I have not seen the French film Pour Elle (Anything for Her).<br /><br />The Next Three Days, is not a flawless film nor is its plot plausible. The strength of the film comes from the actors. The direction seems competent yet it's a generic \\"by the book\\" type of movie. It just doesn't stand out from other movies in the action/drama genre.

B00BHU9DUK|2.0|This was not what I had expected. I did not like this interpretation of the classic. It was a bit too stylized and surrealistic for me. However, the acting was very good,as well as, the scenery.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I am so glad to have finally discovered this book!  It has already made a difference in my relationships and I will use it in my therapy practice.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Creepy, some pretty disturbing material, well acted and directed.  If you like &#34;Insidious&#34; you will like Sinister.  Horror is an acquired taste.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|If I could give negative stars I would. This book reads like a special needs high school student wrote it. The characters all immediately bond stronger than relationships that have lasted lifetimes, plot holes everywhere, and even a main character's name is spelled differently throughout the book (is it Gwen or Gwynn?)
B0037VNX44|1.0|Title says it all.  Pass on this one, because it is slow.  It wasn't entertaining to me at all.  I suggest you find something else.
B008K9UZY4|4.0|How fun this game is but can't down lode it on my phone now so I'll tri later. How cool it is.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|Starts bit slow and casual, but once you're on this train, you realize its becomes a roller-coaster. The emotions in this book are extremely powerful and you can easily identify with the characters. They are so NOW.
0785814531|5.0|This book is not all of Edgar Allan Poes stuff. Its a little more than half. Its definitely incomplete<br />This book is great though . No doubt totally excellent
B004NSURT4|4.0|Great read.  good spy novel, with a few twists in an era before mobile phones and the internet.  Highly reccomended.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|So much fun. If you like the movies you'll love this game. Only downside is you have pay money to advance fast otherwise it's slow moving but still fun
B006GKHE6G|4.0|ok so it is a really good game and idea but you should practice because the controls are really bad and hard. I love racing games.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is fun to play. A bit blotchy at times however. It is stimulating and I'm happy with the program.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Definitely not what you expect. It's a fantastic movie that you will watch again and again! Feel good, fun movie!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a great time killer and is fun I love this game on my fire and I pod it has  levels you pay for but most are free! You should download this for at home and car rides. Everyone I know who has downloaded this has enjoyed playing and you will too

B00AI29MMC|5.0|Yet the writing is so full that we can feel part of this other world.<br /><br />I came to this story by the back door. My first introduction to Somerset Maugham was through the movie \\"The Razor's Edge\\" (1946) staring Tyrone Power as Larry Darrell. I have no idea as to how much it was adapted from the book. Then in 1984 we watched Bill Murray as Larry Darrell. This film lost what magic the 1946 film had. So it was time to read the book. Yes I know very few films can do more than present the essence of a book. Turns out that even the older film wrote Summerset out of some of the scenes.<br /><br />Larry is back from the war (WWI). As with many of us he is left with nagging questions about why one person lives and another must die. This problem leads Larry to search for the answers. He turns down opportunities and takes up a lifestyle to help him find answers.  This story is told or narrated by Somerset Maugham himself. In the book Somerset takes more of an active part in the story. Larry came as close as any of us to the answer, he seeks and we leave him much the same way one enters and leaves your life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0007PALVQ The Razor's Edge - Gene Tierney]]<br />[[ASIN:6303333079 Razor's Edge [VHS]]]
B007CRS628|3.0|Let me begin by saying that I hold Hemingway in high esteem: so much so that while at the Key West Literary Seminar this year I visited his home for a second time. I have read nearly all of his novels and admire his devotion to writing insofar as he lived humbly in Paris among the Lost Generation to establish himself as a novelist. He paid his existential and literary dues as a novelist and was richly rewarded for his gifts. \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is an early work and, although one can see his promise as a novelist, this particular novel suffers from a green, preening style, which may well the case of early autobiographically consuming novels. The book is taken from Hemingway's experiences in Paris on the Left Bank, the fiestas of Pamplona during the running of the bulls and fishing for trout in the mountains of Northern Spain. Despite the relative immaturity of his style he was an innovator: he was one of the early novelists to write dialogue with a truly sensitive ear attuned toward the ways in which ordinary people spoke to each other. He was committed to creating verisimilitude in dialogue and dialect. The characters cover themselves in their conversations with the slang of the day: \\"Women made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, (sic) you had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship...The bill always came. That was one of the swell things you could count on.\\" One claim he makes, the truth of which may not be denied, is that we certainly pay for the things that we do: \\"You paid some way for everything that was any good.\\" So Hemingway produces a literary style for dialogue that is so readily played out in the novelists who follow him and becomes so advanced in its execution by them that a work like \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" almost seems a parody in many places. It must be one of the most quoted works in the Good Bad Hemingway Contest held annually which both praises and parodies his novels. He writes in criticism of another writer that \\"He's through... He's written about all the things he knows, and now he's on all the things he doesn't know.\\" Hemingway always wrote about the things that he knew from first-hand experience: war, fishing, writing, Cuba, Key West, the UP of Michigan, Paris, safari and women. Hem was a man of half as many wives as Henry VIII. Although he knew many women intimately, he didn't really understand them fully. I find that in many places Hemingway's women, even Lady Brett Ashley, play over and over again primarily as helpless objects of desire. In this book like most of his other characters Brett is a flat character and a stereotype for women of his era. I also found that other minorities (Jews, Afro-Americans) seem diminished in his work except for bull fighters and fishermen, essentially they are servants to a greater or lesser extent. Later in the \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" clearly this is not the case but it is true here in this book. He still has not yet really developed the sense of humanity which would emerge later to earn him a Nobel Prize for Literature. The male characters also seem flat with the Jewish boxer, Robert Cohn, and his hedonistic friends, Bill and the drunken Michael. He draws the bullfighter, Romero, a Spanish Romeo quite elegantly because he imbues in this character the deep respect Hemingway had for the courageous bullfighters and also portrays the bulls themselves as heroic, magnificent forces of nature, downstream like the great marlin, doomed by man's tragic desire to conquer and kill them for sport or sustenance as God similarly may play with mankind. Jake Barnes is a well drawn figure because he is Hemingway. It's as if Hemingway created Robert Cohn to be himself like a boxer, and Mike like the big drinker and the Hemingway women as the objects of desire that he sought. The book is poorly edited: I know, sorry, not withstanding Maxwell Perkins this is heresy but I stand by my claim. The stories about the fiesta at Pamplona and running of the bulls and the trout fishing and Brett with Romero weave a compelling tale worth reading. His writing about bull fighting and fishing attest to his fascination with both sports and elsewhere in hunting on safari. Then there is, of course, the elegant innuendo of the unfortunate war wound, one of the great scars of life for a man devoted to total immersion in his existential experience: none of us go through life without scars and a few may become immortal but rarely do we come out alive in the end. By all means read Hemingway but perhaps not this novel. Read the immortal works of Hemingway in \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" and \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" and \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" and \\"The Torrents of Spring\\" and even \\"Across the River and into the Trees\\" which impress me more as the Nobel Prize winner rather than the green, American newspaperman in Paris of the Lost Generation. Hemingway is an iconic American author whose simplicity of style and power in telling a story earned him vast wealth and reverence as a writer during and after his lifetime: what novelist worth his salt wouldn't want to come back in the next life as Hem?nd the trout fishing and Brett with Romero weave a compelling tale worth reading.

0061537934|4.0|Sweet dog lovers book with a fun twist in the end! It was a good read and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00000E1W0|3.0|It had a few tunes that are worthy of note, but nothing like the &#34;Icehouse&#34; album.  Bous tracks are good.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|this series is so well done and a page turner that doesn't stop.  I couldn't wait for the next in the series and I've read all so far and 100% enjoyed them all.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|Pros:<br />The record player and all the hardware produce outstanding quality sound at least for the non-audiophile.<br />Physical operation is very simple.  I transferred 118 LP vinyl over three weeks effortlessly in a few weeks.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. You must install itunes, yuck.  Bu they provide it on their CD.<br />2. Supplied software has a bug where you enter track title, but it doesn't work.  You must get into Explorer and rename it manually.<br />3. Software is OK at identifying track breaks for the usual pop songs, but fails miserably for live albums or other esoteric music where there are no silent breaks.  In that mode it provides a way for you to break it up into tracks, but you must sit there and listen.<br /><br />Overall:  if you have basic computer skills and can manipulate MP3's outside of their software, then this is great value, especially for the price.  But if you are not very good at computer stuff, then you might have a problem.
B007V65R54|4.0|In part, I have to admit I love this book because I agree with close to 95% of the points Silver makes. An excellent critique of the current media fascination with big data and predictive analytics. Also joins many insiders in criticizing the integrity of the scientific literature. There is much to recommend in this book. I only give it 4 stars rather than 5 because it could have used some editing. Signal and the Noise seems to repeat the same points over and over, so there i a lot of redundancy. The book could have probably been reduced by half.  It is probably difficult to make some of the arguments in the book interesting to the general public, but Silver does a good job of trying to weave a story and narrative.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|The display works really well with the kindle but the stream of rotating ads on top is distracting. Good app when helping kids with homework!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I am going to guess I am not Downton Abbey's target audience. Still, overall I find it to be an enjoyable series, although it seems to lose its way in Season 2. I guess the sophomore jinx. In particular, when you have a story line that features a returning relative who had amnesia for years and also suffered bad burns and has their face taped so they are unrecognizable, you could be watching any  soap opera parody.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Yes, if Bingo is your thing, you will not go wrong with this app.  I love the different counties  you can go to . Very clever on this.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It's a little glitchy but it doesn't really bother me.<br />I can see that a lot of work went into this game and definitely deserves the five stars I gave it
B00B99KJR0|4.0|There are a few areas of poor explatantion when you get deeper into the game. Other than that I like the game. Would purchase a simular game .
B005TKD6NY|5.0|Muarakami's depth and emotional insight is unrivalled. Norwegian Wood is a novel everyone, not stuck on less demanding literature, should read. I feel much richer having discovered this fantastic author.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT AND FUN APP. I RECOMMENED THIS GAME FOR ANY AGE. HORSE LOVERS ARE REALLY GONNA LOVE THIS GAME. GREAT GRAPHICS AND WORKS AWESOME ON MY KINDLE FIRE. PLEASE DOWNLOAD THIS GAME AND HAVE SOME FUN!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This is a fun game if you can get it started.  It works most times I load it up, and I enjoy the gameplay very much.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a really fun game because you can train your very own horse. I would recommend this game to any one who loves horses.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have gotten hooked on hidden object games and this is one of the best I've played.  In fact, I compare other games with this one.  The storyline is interesting, the progression is well paced and the graphics are beautiful.  I vote that they make a sequel.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|very much enjoy playing. reminds me of the movie they kept it to the theme and like the addition of the water
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great read.  Action packed and it keeps you guessing. Another great read in the Reacher series.  Always enjoy these books.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Never would have thought it possible I could get addicted to a &#34;Zombie&#34; show - I've never even watched a Zombie movie.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this game.  It is a non stressful thinking exercise, once I got the hang of what I was supposed to do.  I will probably play this game daily to help me get focused and balanced.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable games I have tried on my Kindle.  Nice sound, fantastic graphics and ample gameplay options keep the game fun and challenging.  You won't be sorry with this one!
B00BHU9DUK|5.0|I've never been able to get past the first few chapters of this book...I've always fallen asleep and lost interest eventually.  But that's me.  I don't however, believe this movie to be perfectly literal in it's interpretation.  That said, I thought this move to be visually stunning, coherent in it's incoherence, elaborately costumed and symbolically beautiful.  I very much enjoyed this flick!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Extended Edition (DVD +UltraViolet) (2013) (I made my purchase at a local target rather than Amazon.<br /><br />What you need to know -- the digital \\"Ultra-violet\\" is a very limited choice of options as you MUST have one of the digital provider proprietary systems such as Apple's iTunes and that means you can only access it via \\"registered and approved devices\\" and are limited to how many can access it -- you can't even buy a second license for it.<br /><br />It would be better to just buy the DVD set and do the digital yourself.<br /><br />Now to the Extended Version of the movie --- That is what raised my 3 stars to 5 -- the Extended Version makes the movie actually more enjoyable and much less choppy. Even the humor scenes are a bit more enjoyable.<br /><br />This is a much better addition to my Lord of the Rings library -- and DVDs will play in all DVD players (region respecting unless you find a region free version out there).<br /><br />The \\"official\\" reviews suggest the added content was very limited -- yet in my opinion it actually makes the movie play much better and more consistent story spell hold.<br /><br />As to the people complaining about the adaptation of the book, remember there will always be differences, among which are the lack of mental insights gained from reading about characters internal responses to the various situations... so far as I know only the original adaptation of DUNE attempted this and even then there was much chopping due to the time limits to a Hollywood production -- so a story such as The Hobbit will be different in a motion picture than the book -- yet this production (with the extended footage) holds true enough that Tolken's vision is not lost in the adaptation.<br /><br />It is a worthy addition to any video library -- and worth interviewing with reading of the books.<br /><br />I will now wait for the extended edition of the Hobbit 2 before watching it so I can just enjoy the better movie.<br />-----------------<br />Non-extended version review:<br />Firstly, must point out that I rented this movie via amazon's Instant Video -- my only problem is actually a problem with Cox because if I am connected for more than an hour, they tent to temper my speed so that Amazon's streaming system gets lost or blocked.<br /><br />Now about the movie. I was disappointed -- I watched it in two parts on my 48 hour rent:<br /><br />Night 1 I watched to the Rivendale sequence was completed -- (note that there can be no spoiler in this movie as long as you have read the book)  There was a lot of attempt at humor that just did not do near as well as the Quad from the Lord of the Rings hobits did. It actually seemed to bog the movie down a rather large bit making it really hard to stick with it. I hope that the Extended Version that will come out towards Christmas will correct that.<br /><br />Night 2 -- Much better going from the Rivendale departure to the end -- more of what the Lord of the Rings movies was about. But that is not to say that there were'nt a few elements to take away from it -- the goblin king seemed at times to havt the kind of Gungan King appeal from the Star Wars Episode 1 and as much as I liked the original cuts of Star Wars 4 to 6, I did not like the Star Wars Episode I at all -- so something like that just takes away from Jackson's Hobit.<br /><br />I suspect that this is due to the essential take-over of MGM's corporation oversite by WB -- they tend to be more flashy with fantasy stuff (Remember how the mishandled Harry Potter?)<br /><br />I hope that the Jackson oversite when putting out the extended versions will prove the same with this movie as it did with the LotR -- believe it or not the Extended Cuts of LotR is so extra-ordinarily better than the theatrical release, so that I why I chose to rent this rather than buy -- and will look forward to the Extended cut release at the end of this year -- economy permitting.
B00AXVH8KQ|5.0|So many compared this CD with so many long-gone and what I consider stale musicians (I mean c'mon people, can someone please stop peddling the 'greatness' 40-50 year old music???).  But I find this CD to be very new and refreshing with high-key tinges of the past.  The songs are great, not too overdone with overlapping genres.  First I heard of this band, and I will be looking into the future to see what's next.  I expect it will be as good as this CD.
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book although I was hoping to read that she did finally get her memory back. It was still a great book.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|This is a nice flick.  To me, the symbolism was overdone.  The ending left me a bit cold.  Visually, very beautiful, but all animation.  So why it was nominated and won at the Oscars is a little baffling.  The subject of the animation was amazing and portrayed very sweetly.  The story was OK.  The writing was OK.  I guess perhaps I had higher expectations as an Oscar nominee than I felt it delivered.  I'm not sure, with all the superb animation and computer graphics that exist in the world these days, why this movie was so chatted-up.  I found it to be a faux-myth without much substance at all.  With all that said, it's worth the rental fee, perhaps a good purchase.  If you want to know 'everything' that can be done on a computer, then it's worth it as well.  A little disappointed.
111846446X|5.0|Very informative guide to the Pi and what to do with it. I'd recommend it to a friend for sure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Just like my title says the best game out there and to add to the greatness it's totally free BUY it because Yolo (you only live once)
B00BQBNK04|5.0|The soundtrack was a lovely addition to my collection. While it's not my favorite soundtrack, it definitely does the show justice
B00B49L7JY|5.0|An excellent documentary that tells an unbelievable story. Searching for Sugar Man does a great job of conveying the joy of music, it's humble beginnings and, sometimes, fairy tale endings.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|guess by now you know how much I like all angry birds stuff , or at least most of them ,some are kind of dorkey, but you , as in life win some  and lose some.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is a good game for all ages. it is addictive especially trying to top my score. buy it
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|just getting into it, but really is good recomend getting this as soon as you can I`m really hooked on all angry birds stuff.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|Downloading this was a waste of my time because the purpose I'd downloaded it for wasn't met. They also ask for you're email. They emails are constant and very annoying. If you were hoping this app would fufill the purpose of hacking or whatever, don't get this. It doesn't work.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|still waiting for the rest of star wars to be completed,  but it seems like forever.to get it. but was gone for ten weeks, may it is updated by now
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|So addictive and a lot o' fun. Guide Lep through safely while collecting coins, pine cones, and lives. Good controls, very smooth feel the game. Enjoy!
B0011Z1BOC|5.0|This album--classic rock and roll.  This is a true classic album from the Chili Peppers.  I've heard people say its full of testosterone among other things, but however you want to describe it, it's all good.  I'm telling you--classic rock and roll.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Started. Playing this bane after watching my boo played for hours and got hooked as well. Wish there were more options for the gig b<br />ox but real nice to pass the time away.
B00AG4BZFE|5.0|I'm a big fan of Wrightson's old school comic illustration style. This is an excellent collection of his work. Check it out.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|IF ONLY  OUR POLITICIANS OF TODAY WOULD  TRULY  LOVE AND  WORK FOR THEIR COUNTRY AS THIS MAN DID WE  COULD  ESCAPE OUR  PROBLEMS AND  HOME AND ABROAD.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We love it! Couldn't wait to see season 3! So glad Amazon has it to stream, as no one else does.
B0050PYNN0|1.0|Not funny at all.  I have no problem with crude humor as long is it's funny.  This was not funny to me at all.  You'd have to either be high or 12 years old to laugh at this stuff.  I suspect many people who gave this good reviews were high when they watched it.  Pineapple Express and Cheech and Chong movies are funny to me.  My bad review isn't because I'm offended.  IT JUST WAS NOT FUNNY AT ALL.  I almost never leave movie reviews.  This was so bad, I felt compelled to.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love Downton Abby! Now we are impatiently waiting until January 2014 to see season 4! My only complaint is that season 3 was not free with my Amazon Prime. I had to pay $1.99 per episode. I think that is wrong. It is not clearly stated anywhere that some streaming is not free. Amazon needs to make that more clear to its Prime members. I thought I had total free streaming.
B00BYOEZTI|4.0|Only issue I had was the streaming kept skipping a lot toward the end. I have a great internet connection so I'm not sure what the problem was. The movie itself was very good.<br /><br />If your a LOTR fan dont miss this movie.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in knowing more about Oscar Wilde. The story plot is truly timeless.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't stop watching it. So a lot of people I know are addicted as well. Now some people say they can't wait for the zombie apocalypse to happen ,as if it was. I try to remind them, just a show. Calm down.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I think this is a great little usb mixer for the price.  I bought 2 of them since the first one worked well.  It's very convenient.  The adjustment dials work fine, the treble and bass, etc.  It's small too, so it fits nicely on the desk.  I use it for giving online presentations with a mic.  If you want something simple to use with bass and treble, this will do the job.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Better than other apps I have tried. Just like the desktop version. But, like most apps doesn't let you say happy bday from news feed. Not a very big deal considering.
B008VBYN80|4.0|It is a fun game to play.  Graphics are good and so far the story line is entertaining.Not to hard to grasp and my son is enjoying it as well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was a rollercoaster of emotions. I took my Kindle with me on vacation and read it with every spare moment..Loved it....kept me intrigued, scared, mad and happy.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Graphics are very good and so far it is fun to play.  Hack and slash type right now but my son and I are very entertained.
B005JABSB6|5.0|These 3D glasses are great, they were just what I needed. Very simple to use and have a good fit.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|just loved this book, amazing story putting you through all kinds of emotions!! hanging by a thread for the follow up book. So in love with Travis!!! and abby.. :)
B0072OFM28|5.0|I love this DVD. The characters and story lines keep you wanting more. The main characters look good even though they are often covered with mud and blood. Sometimes I have to look away during the violent scenes, but for the most part, it is great. I also plan to purchase Season 3.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|I find it very unlikely in a Grand House like Downton Abbey to find so much drama regarding the aspects of some scenes involving homosexuality. Almost all of the servant class were vowed into celibacy and also would rarely include a husband and wife team. Kind of felt where this was going in season two. I'm done. Will be interesting to see if season three draws as many viewers as one and early two did. Then again I could be wrong, just my opinion as to what I wish to view.......... is that still allowed??????????? This was not meant to offend anyone, as I judge no one to their choice of life, nor discriminate against anyone. I wouldn't have liked torrid love scenes with the Crowley's either.  Just felt it took away the grandeur of looking into a era almost all but gone.
B003L77G8I|5.0|I love this series and I really enjoy watching the characters work out the mystery of the deaths of their &#34;finds&#34;.
B004GYY714|5.0|love to listen to NPR now I dont miss an episode, as well as some good old 70's rock now and then flashbacks I guess to sillier days. Nice app very happy
B000065U1N|3.0|I have not watched this DVD yet.but I am looking forward to watching the film and seeing how the story goes about this incredible real event
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Love to listen to NPR with this I have all of the broadcast, and an occasional late 60's  70's rock music (flashbacks)
B009GX6600|5.0|I love NCIS.  This was special to me as the sargaent on the show plays Wendell on BONES and I already know his character and find him a good character.  Also the dog, DAX was special with Gibbs. This is a very special show to me.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I love it because it works just like a basic or scientific calculator. It is easy to use and has big buttons.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I LOve this game you get to  MAKE DRAGONS AND NAME THEM and I named mine tj because my name is tj and I'm 9 years old
B008OOYALE|4.0|I don't like that it is hard to earn gold. Creative dragon breeds. I like the differences in the &#34;personalities &#34;.
B001HBWY8M|4.0|Amanda Bynes did a great job in this coming of age comedy movie,  which is for all ages to watch.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Inspiring and heartfelt.  A true testament to human capacity to overcome any obstacle.  From addiction to disability, Adam Brown conquered his demons and refused to allow adversity to push him down.  With his faith and determination, Adam was Fearless on and off the battlefield.  A thoroughly riveting account of his life and legacy!
B009ANP4F4|3.0|Step Up has had many incarnations...1-2-3, etc. Each is not a continuation of the previous one, has different cast & can stand on it's own which contradicts the adage that the sequels are never as good as the original. &#34;Revolution&#34; has some interesting dance sequences but the beginning dragged a bit.
B0087GF8ZG|1.0|The average score and positive reviews were very misleading.  I had high hopes for this, installed the mounting screws, only to find out that the product is defective out of the box.  The motion sensor never worked -- the auto option is completely dead on arrival.<br /><br />I may do a video review to prove it to you all, but it's a total sham.  Its been a while since I've been this displeased in a product and it in no way deserves the rating it has on Amazon.<br /><br />Someone else said they may have well just bought a nightlight from the Dollar Store.  That's exactly right.  It's poorly made and false advertised.  The company that makes this does not deserve to make any more money off suckers for this product.<br /><br />You have a choice of others, pick something else.  Read my other reviews, this is one of the only negative reviews I've left.  Really really displeased customer.<br /><br />I hope this review stops at least a handful of you from making this purchase.
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn/Mitch Rapp...what more needs to be said? If you're a fan, this just adds to Rapp's history/backstory. Well done.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Being a classic series, I am so happy to own this series.  Great quality and I will be watching this over and over.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|My all-time show (& I'm a Sr. Citizen).  Great acting; character development; scenery; historical  facts; story line; many variations of stories.  There are so many &#34;little stories&#34; woven throughout each episode - for instance when a couple falls in love with a little dog. We've just begun season 6 - a short season - and like a great book, we will feel as though we've lost a best friend.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|It was the first book I had read by this author. It was one of those books that once you start reading it you don't want to put it down.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Even though there is less zombie killing action this season, the story lines have been great. Every week i look forward to watching and don't mind the $2 a week i spend on it.
B009369Z8A|5.0|I was so happy to see this made into a movie.  The book got a little confusing to me, the way it jumped around in time, but they did a brilliant job with the movie.  Tom Hardy steals the movie 100%.  Sorry, Shia.  In the theatre I went to, Tom got whoops, cheers and a standing ovation at the end of the film.  Best movie in a long time!
B0092SQBJA|5.0|I had never heard of the Two Door Cinema Club, until they were recommended to me through Amazon. As I listened to the previews, I really liked what I was hearing, and decided to buy the CD. I was not let down. Every song has a unique feel, and sound. While I enjoy every track, two of my favorites are Sleep Alone, and The World is Watching.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this game is really great. it goes on juneys for this little leporcon. but don't let him dye! get this app!!!!!!!!!!!
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|At first, I wasn't sure about Lucy Liu, but by the third episode, I really grew to like her Watson.  This is a fun take on Sherlock and Johnny Lee Miller provides a quirky, modernized update to the character that feels in keeping with the original.  Worth watching!
B008D28HYS|4.0|After playing through most of the original, it was nice to find a new version. The addition of multiple colors changes the logic enough to make it a new game, but it's close to the older one that the learning curve isn't too steep.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Story, cast and costumes!  A must see; one can only wish it never ends.  Well worth the time to view every episode
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see their live show recently and it brought the album alive for me.  The intensity is there, it's just deeper, more subtle, more emotional, and more about the beauty of it all; it's less dependent on beat to convey it's message.  One clear example was Jubilee Street which was very powerful live; I hope there's some live material from the tour someday.  To me the album can't be analyzed because it's something you have to feel, feel inside yourself.  Give it a few listens, it's deep, absorb the mood, I have and now I can't stop listening.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Enjoy the twist and turns. It will keep you guessing what/who is real or a fabrication of lies and deception.
B0050PYNN0|3.0|A little rough with the language but it was a good story line and my son was happy with it.
B004SBX112|1.0|I chose one stare should be none when I bought this didn't know I have to keep buying eagle feather & other helpers. To me it seems harder to complete the levels than the free version. I will keep trying to use the game but so far NOT as fun or as good as the free. I had so many of the levels done with 3 stars & the little fish but not in the version I paid for with no commercial. I can tell you I loved the free version but the commercial drove you nuts.Good luck to all that buy this I hope you will like it & enjoy as for me so far YUK
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game! Very addicting. Graphics are awesome. Just wish there was a way to back up your game and import to your new device. device In my case it is on my kindle fire..nd I had to start a new game on unreliable hd :( but it is worth it.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I really enjoy reading books by Nelson DeMille.  His sense of humor is wonderful..He can take a serious story line and tell it in a way that is not over your head.  And its like getting inside a man's head with his humor..I have many laughs as I read.  I would recommend his stories to everyone
0064400557|5.0|Both of my children love the book and movie. Easily read and counts towards the Accelerator Reading Program most schools have implemented. Every child should read this classic book.
B003B02PFO|3.0|It was good easy reading, but there was no great plot.  It did have a good ending.  All is well that ends well.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Great and unexpected story. I was catapulted through so many emotions. I wish there was more. I love reading when it is this captivating.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another good book by John Grishham.  I enjoyed the plot.  It kept me in suspense and held my interrest.  While rreading I didn't expect what would happen next.
B0074VA2T2|2.0|I get a &#34;warning, this device is unsupported&#34; when I try to run this app.  I am hopeing that an update will be released resolving this issue.  Looks like a great program my 3 year old would enjoy... if it works.
B006C1DH92|5.0|When I saw the other reviews, I thought I would give it a try.  The game is fun, fast paced, and entertaining.
0525953728|5.0|My son, who hasn't ever read an unassigned novel, loved this book.  He finished it within 2 weeks of its arrival.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|We were not able to watch and finish the movie. It continually crashed (freeze, start over, etc). I do not think we got our money's worth.<br />Nothing wrong with the movie, just the delivery.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My daughter told us to watch this and then we started noticing all the references to it on TV.  Started with Season One a month ago and now halfway through Season Three.  We're stretching it out to really enjoy it.  All the characters are captivating to follow. The changes unfolding in society are extremely interesting and saddening to see how far society has tumbled as to morals, etiquette and relationships. You'll love it unless you're locked into the mindless shows of the current generation.
B004XISI4A|4.0|Everything you would expect from a great George Martin book. Continues with a storylines parallel to and at times intertwining with \\"A Feast for Crows\\". Leaves you waiting for the next book in the series, \\"Winter is Coming\\".
B004V73FGE|5.0|I was a child of the 80's, but I had never seen the original all the way through until shortly before (and by that I mean minutes, not hours) watching this one.  The original took me back in time, but this one knocked me far into the future.  If the computer animation was all it had going for it, it would have been halfway between good and great.  Put in the caliber actors (Jeff Daniels and Bruce Boxleitner return in their original roles, as well as a broad array of excellent supporting cast) and this shoots past great to must-see.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I feel this book fell short of full disclosure.  The author went into exquisite detail about what his body was experiencing, but he does not talk about the lessons he learned while in heaven.  Perhaps he is planning a second book or maybe workshops where he will disclose what he learned, or the lessons do not agree with his conservative Christian views.  Either way, the book fell short of its mark.
B004HMQ7BI|4.0|I had no idea that Iron Man was ever that young...<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr, has always been a great actor, and Marissa Tomei has proven herself here again as well.  Add in a supporting cast of actors whose faces we know like those of our friends, and I find this movie is a real treat.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I love this game, and its more fun drawing in detail on a bigger screen with my Fire HD rather than my android phone. Five stars go android /mobile app, Kindle edition falls short.  I'd like to purchase the upgrade IF * we could buy colors, and bombs could be used for bonus words. When this happens, this will be a five star app. Also, I've been experiencing the crash lately on Kindle Fire. Is this something common? Great game, Kindle edition app falls short. For the record, customer service for account issues is great though.
1250012570|5.0|I knew from the moment I saw Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell that I was going to love it. It was one of those book lover's intuitions and it was spot on. Eleanor & Park is exactly that kind of angsty emotional story that I love. All the consuming and warm and fuzzy feelings of first love are captured perfectly. This is a book that I could read over and over again and never grow tired of it.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is told from alternating points of view. This gives the readers a really unique perspective of their journey to falling in love. My best compliment for this book is that it's realistic. Eleanor is a very odd girl. She's not someone that you come across often in YA. I loved how Park's feelingsdeveloped for her. He was just too nice for his own good. Then before he knew it he was utterly in love with this odd girl. Their feelings played out so quietly at first, just nice gestures and errant thoughts. I couldn't help but swoon.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell knows how to hook a reader. As soon as Elanor sat down with Park on the bus I was a goner. The budding relationship was my favorite part, but there's a lot more to the story. Eleanor has a very troubled home life and it was heartbreaking to see what she had to go through on a day to day basis. She was such a strong character. I really just loved her. Park also has a rocky relationship with his father and it was fascinating to see their push and pull with each other. I loved all the pop culture references since the book takes place in the 80′s.<br /><br />This book makes me heavy sigh just thinking about it. I would read it again in a heartbeat. I will certainly be reading everything by Rainbow Rowell that I can get my hands on. It goes without saying that I recommend Eleanor & Park. It was one of the most realistic and heart wrenching love stories I've read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I purchased the game for my 4-year old niece and was told by a fan of the game it might be too hard for her but she loves it! Now I can babysit easy while I study for genetics she is building her strategy skills so I am a FAN! After downloading many games I finally got one that has her undivided attention = quiet time :)
0062014536|4.0|If you've been a long time reader of my blog then you probably know how completely and utterly blown away I was by Delirium. It been a long and very heartbreaking road, but now we're finally at the end of this trilogy. In Pandemonium, Lauren Oliver took this series in a vastly different direction than I ever would have expected and I ended up being completely okay with that. The ending of book two left me anxious and a little terrified of Requiem, but I'm happy to say that I was very pleased with it. Even if it did go in a different direction than I was expecting as well.<br /><br />I really wanted to reread the first two books before jumping into Requiem, but my distracted mind and overwhelming reading pile didn't allow it. I was happy to see that there was hardly any gap between the books and I found it super easy to pick up the thread of the story again. We were all shocked by the end of Pandemonium, right? Well, Lauren Oliver sure keeps you on the edge of your seat regarding that throughout this book. My lips are sealed other than that. I don't want to spoil anything for you.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this entire trilogy was watching Lena grow from the rule following girl into this amazing warrior for what is right. Her development throughout the series has been extraordinary. I also love the world building. I'm still in awe of the love is a disease concept. The fact that Lauren Oliver didn't make this series predictable at all makes it one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />Requiem was a great ending to this breathtaking trilogy. It might have been my least favorite of the 3, but that doesn't mean much considering just how much I loved them. I was very pleased with the ending and I think you will be too.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good book to kill time, easy to read, takes your mind away from day to day things... A bit too cheesy for me, expected it to be better written, but I felt like I am reading a common blog on the internet...
B0063M22QO|1.0|I purchased this game but it never showed up on my Kindle.<br />Unable to give a review due to the lack of the game on my system
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I hated this whole triology.  The characters aren't likable, especially Anastasia.  These books also perpetuate EVERY stereotype there is out there about people who practice BDSM.
B008476HBM|5.0|I enjoy reading books from this era. The fact that this book contained no ugly language kept me reading it. Very interesting almost like watching Downton Abby.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I enjoyed the storyline and I enjoyed the characters.  I found it very well written and engaging.  It was a deviation from what I usually read and I am very glad that I picked this book up and became engrossed in it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing clear everything before you start you will not be able to put it down for anything
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I love many of the actors from this show from other shows/movies.  I find Joss Whedon's humor awesome and engaging.  The first time I watched this I literally fell over laughing.  It's definitely one of those pieces of work that make you think about the characters and what's really going on.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the book love the story and love the ending I hope fifty shades can continue I really hope it can
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I can't believe any SF fan hasn't already read this....unless they're very young. A classic from a master!  Enjoy a true trip into imagination and character with one of the truly great writers of his generation.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Love this. Have read this book many times since about ten years old. I'm now fifty nine and still enjoy it. I read it when looking forward  to spring. I now have my grandchildren reading it. I have four granddaughters who also like to garden with me.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|We use this for our kindle that is used often by a five and three year old. It protects the device well. We even bought one for a relative.
0316077046|5.0|I like the authors and liked the first book; how could you not continue to read the others?<br />very thrilled at the end and how could you not wait to read the third book?<br />that's why i bought them all.  Just started reading Beautiful Chaos.
0316017930|5.0|Great book. Shed's light on may things the average person has never considered. You get done reading this book a much smarter person.
0802473156|5.0|The book is informative to self and how we can build and have better relationships when we know which love language of those we love.  Gave this book to all four of my adult children and suggested they read them together.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|Evie is such a sweet character only she can change Sebastian for the good. I can't wait to read Daisy`s story.
B004W2V254|4.0|Simple storyline, but very entertaining and gripping to watch. Don't usually like movies with subtitles, but this one was very good.
1576754227|5.0|This book is one of my favorites. I read the book with my board. It provided tools to aid busy people as well as people who have a habit of procrastinating. I refer to the book often in my public courses.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my Mother - For a Christmas gift.  She enjoyed the movie and has shared it with her friends.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is SO ADDICTING! Its so fun and cool. I actually have a score of 972 in Arcade Mode! AWESOME! &#9733;
B009NQLT0M|5.0|This fan has many good reviews and for good reason.  I have a media centre that gets quite hot as I live and work in Africa most of the time.  My worst enemy was the cpu fan that went nuts in the middle of a movie... it was quite annoying.  This fan (kit) has all the parts to fit many applications and even a pigtail to modify your connection in case they forgot one.  The install was a cinch and I had to shine a light in to make sure the fan was moving, it was so quiet.  Even full tilt in video my cpu runs cooler and no noise.  We have enough noise in our lives we don't need our homes to add any more... thanks guys for a great product.
B008OOYALE|1.0|This does not measure up in any way to other fantasy 'farm' games. The graphics are harsh and it is difficult to maneuver around the island on a smaller device such as Kindle Fire 7&#34;.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Each show keeps me wanting the next.  The characters keep me invested and the acting is superb.  One of the best dramas ever.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|The only thing that makes this movie worthy of 2 stars is the performances of the two leads. Phoenix and Hoffman are at the top of their game, but even they cannot save this movie. The film is borderline nonsensical, with a script that seems to have no real plot or direction. I truly believe that Anderson conjured up this mess of a film with the belief that people would mistake it's incompetence for brilliance. And it worked, because the moronic film critics of the world ate this pile of crap like it was a bowl of chocolate pudding.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app is really pretty cool,if you don't pick the winning hand at the begining of the game be in for some frustration. Other than the winning hand I haven't been able to win...Grr.. could be my skills but now I feel l I'm a. Cop out . Fun times though
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|i really loved this game it was scary and exciting and kept me interested from beginning to end great game
B000TGJ80I|4.0|Great!!!
B0086HGW42|5.0|If you like Jack Johnson, Dido or that style of music, Ed Sheeran's music is a must have!  His music is easy on the ears.  Nothing negative to say!  :-)
B003Y5H5F6|4.0|Great!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|sometimes a game needs to stimulate your mind, but not jack you up doing it!  This is wonderful.  So soothing.  You barely know you're thinking.  Good mental exercise with calming graphics and sound.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great!!!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|This is a great movie for children and adults. If you like well written animated movies this is a must see.
B000F4RHB6|4.0|Great!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really great book. Keeps you guessing, wondering, hoping until the last page. Everyone knows a 'Nick' and an 'Amy'.  Definite must read.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was exciting, suspense filled, FUNNY and an easy read.  Sometimes a bit technical but thoroughly enjoyable.  Would make a good movie.
B008KZVNLC|5.0|Rupert Everett not the star but Benedict Cumberbatch.  I purchased an all region portable DVD player to watch this.  Available in pal format only.  It is brilliant. If only there could be more programs of this quality.  Why was it not advertised more? The book is well worth spending the time to read also.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This little app is accurate in my area, I can pull it up in a second and know exactly what to expect for the day. I have it on my Fire and my phone so I always know the temperature and any changes in weather. Far better than my weather man.
B007SGM084|4.0|Well wrote. A deffinate bed side novel. I purchased the kindle trilogy version. Works great. Loved the bookmarking. I think a movie would be going too far as this should simply be a fantasy in our our minds.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|YOU can never go wrong with any. MCEWAN BOOK. THE excellence of literary style keeps me reading. Like walking alittle fast through an art gallery, you can allow your eyes to linger abit more on certain paintings or reread sentences again to appreciate the wordsmith. I thought it was abit of a novella, and mirrored that part of the book. Not as satisfying as his others, but worth the time and effort.
1451695195|2.0|The author claims that he traveled to the world of spirits and the worlds beyond our physical life in an NDE (near-death experience). He starts the book with scientific and logical/medical explanations of his medical case. Then delves deeper spiritually and attempts to convince us that he visited heaven - no evidence or support is presented. And the author never explains how he came back from this trip although he was about to die. So he contracted a weird illness (as he claims he dint know where it came from) then magically heals although medically it was impossible. Book is beautifully written but full of contradictions. Church goers will love this book. Not for people who believe in logic, science, and proven logical evidence.<br /><br />Yousef
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I love this game. It is sooo fun! It provides lots of entertainment. I recommend this game for horse lovers.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is a very good book. It tells a full story no cliffhangers or loose ends and yet I can't wait for book two.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a pretty coo little game, really reminds me of Mario. I wish I could just load the real one with out all the complications of going threw those other apps and you have to get the game tron offline.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm not a video game freak in the least bit but I found this book extremely interesting.  I would  recommend  it to anyone.
B000PH40HM|4.0|This is the story of a boy who, with a magic ticket, watched a movie starring his favorite action hero and was transported into the movie while he was watching it.  It was enjoyable to see how he tried to convince the hero (Arnold S.) that he was just in a movie and it was not real.  The fun was watching how the boy tried to convince Arnold.  I feel that many of the explanations went over the audence's heads since they were subtile in nature.  The movie was, in my opinion, both exciting and very enjoyable.  I recommend this movie.  It was a fun, light movie with a good story line.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is the best game I have ever played,this game has awesome graphics and has really cool people to unlock and run with.
B00006879E|5.0|Nice songs form some of the earlier days of Maroon5. I miss hearing some of their older hits so this is a good CD to have.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book truly is a good book predictable at times but very good. I feel Nicholas sparks is a fantastic writer and I'm looking forward to reading another one of his books !!
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I think this is a great CD. I love all the songs. It was a great price and came with the digital download. One of their best CD's to date.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Awesome<br />Cool<br />I picked this because I love to read anything about stuff I also want to thank you very much for this dictionary I will read it a lot<br />From Bridget hope farmer.<br />@54131Parkvill rd
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game! its not as good as bakery story, but it is still one of my favorites.  I like how in the team lava games that there is a button in the top right corner that lets me go between my bakery and restaurant. it also ties between all the team lava games. I go in between the games while my food is cooking!&hearts;
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 Is so much fun and a bit more addicting than Temple Run. Plus it has more powers you can choose from to help you get a better score. You can also cheat death by using a gem. The characters are cooled too.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Thanks to a very good friend I read this book, is super intetesting  and I think that can change many many lives
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Fantastic writing and acting.  No vanilla plot lines or characters here.  Anybody else noticing that TV drama series like Homeland, Breaking Bad and Boardwalk Empire are making the standard-issue movies that Hollywood serves up these days look pathetic by comparison?
0763619612|5.0|I loved this book, which I purchased for Christmas for my 5-yr old niece.  It has unique names for the characters, which is always nice to see in a children's novel, as well as a heart-warming message that there is always a creative spark in you.  I would absolutely recommend this book for young children and beginning readers.
