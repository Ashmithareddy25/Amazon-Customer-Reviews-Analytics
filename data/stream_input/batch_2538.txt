B00A7W29BE|2.0|I love the idea of this application. I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought of this. the problem I have with it is big though: it doesn't work very well for kindle fire. with a front mounted camera it is near impossible to scan your documents properly. if I was using this on my phone it would be no problem at all and I would more than likely be giving it five stars, but I got it on my kindle and am more than disappointed.
B003SNKBXW|1.0|To be clear, the story is worth five stars, but the terrible scan and failure to proofread same means I can't recommend the Kindle edition of this book. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves ripping people off with lousy scans like this one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is fabulous!! I can't even explain how much a enjoyed this book! I think that it is a book that everyone should read. It gives a new outlook on life and you end up feeling for the characters! I loved it...but have tissues ready!
B00005JSGK|5.0|It's one of the Duke's better movies that's not a western.  I'd put in almost in the same category as The Quiet Man.  The actors are terrific and the cinematography is spectacular.  It's great entertainment and of course, we get the classic song, Baby Elephant Walk, from this movie.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|It is definetly a pass time that does get you hooked. She was slow to start but now she can fall a sleep with it.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Pretty much what I expected...an easy action movie with some neat gadgets .  Par for the course as far as mission impossible flicks go
B00COGXX7A|5.0|this movie was excellent I highly reccomend it to people who enjoy thrillers and the cast was awesome! so cuddle with a big pillow and a drink and enjoy!
B00CF2UORK|2.0|The first season of Shaun the Sheep is brilliant: simple stories, a genuine wit and charm and an innocence in the plots and characters.  None of them have ill intentions, except for the pigs who are the antagonists.  I am and always will be a huge fan of season one.<br /><br />Season two, however, is a stark change from season one and the humor has changed from simple wit and charm to offensive humor.  The nature of the characters have changed as well, as now it is not simply Shaun trying to have fun, coming up with a plan, and then shenanigans ensuing.  The second season makes every character to be a manipulative opportunist, including the dog, each of the sheep including Shaun, and even the cat.  If I wanted to watch television with a bunch of jerks I'd just watch regular television.<br /><br />In the second season I saw Shaun flip the bird (as in his middle finger,) the flock sabotage each other, and the farmer try to make a buck off of some ducks on his farm.  The first season showed the flock to be united, the farmer was not THAT opportunistic, and there were definitely no middle fingers.  In the first season it shows that everyone listens to Shaun and likes and respects him, whereas in season two the flock and the dog at one point are laughing at him and gesturing that he's crazy.<br /><br />It is a sad change and the show lost all of its heart in Season 2.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is great. It is so nice to be able to get the weather and the maps at the touch of a finger and not have to wait for the report on the television. We use this nearly every day.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I've been a fan of many law shows over the years starting with LA Law, The Practice and most recently Boston Legal. But what's great about the Good Wife is that it's not just another law show. You get a more behind the scenes look at how law firms are really run. Instead of focusing mostly on passionate closing arguments in front of a jury, you get to see the investigative work behind the scenes, how cases get settled, pleaded out an much more. Plus, Alicia, the main character, is excellent, unflappable and inspiring. All of the characters are really well done in fact. Nice to see that good scripted television hasn't died entirely.  5 stars all the way. The first season has been full of surprises thus far.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This version of Mahjong is very nice. I love that there are so many game variations and background pictures. Great game.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|the seminude scenes with Megan Fax were the only highlights of the movie. Seemed like the director could not make up his mind as to what kind of movie he wanted to make,

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I liked how the book took You  on the adventure. As she traveled the PCT and to watch her grow thru it
B008JGSM6G|3.0|not as fun as I thought it would be, but probably aimed for the younger generation of savvy kids not adults

B000F8O35U|5.0|It was advertised as a used item but it was brand new. It was a great surprise.  She was very happy with her birthday gift.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Liked this book, it was more complex with the female protagonist than I first thought. However, both characters could be be developed more. I do like the build-up, angst, and chemistry between the two characters. I wasn't ready for it to end.
B004KPQK2S|4.0|The story sugar-coats history a bit, but Secretariat was a legend, and as Americans, we love our legends. Go, Big Red!

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am 68 years old and I am enjoying this game. I a sure<br />The young folks have this done in a couple days but I have<br />at it for a week.  WISH my grandson lived closer to help me. :!)
B00000DFSK|5.0|This is one of the best U2 CDs ever made!  I got it for my 11th birthday (I've loved U2 sine I was eight years old).  All in all the title says it all.  :-)
B008OM0EDO|1.0|If you'd like to feel stupider, watch this POS film. I am very thankful that I watched some of it through my Prime membership rather than pay for the actual movie. It is clearly made for the brain dead, mass-media, zombie hordes in the American idiocracy today.
B009L7MD44|5.0|Because it does exactly what I expected it to do. Now I can easily access my external storage devices through any kind of Web connection.
B00BMT9SQA|4.0|Talk about a nag!  She smoothers him but turns out to be a good friend also. Makes me want to try a trip with one of my parents.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I love it and it works well a must have for everyone who works with numbers all the time in business
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I enjoyed this very much. I purchased each of the complete season sets as they came out. Since the retelling varied from the classic legend--in a good way--I came to it having no expectations of what changes there might be. In fact, I was looking forward to the changes. I especially enjoyed how the characters evolved: from prince to king, from servant to queen, from a loyal ward to her evilness, from 'apprentice' to powerful sorcerer. Even the dragon evolved from a captive full of rage to an aging benefactor. I found the stop-action rendering of the final sword fighting scenes very interesting. The lighting itself (dark scenes, light scenes) became a character in it's expression. No storyline is perfect but I find only one Major fault: Why didn't the ghost rat on Merlin?  Whatever faults other reviewers may have found may be the result of looking for the negative. Any fan of the sword and sorcery genre will be entertained and appreciative of this production. As a final note, I feel the need to mention the make-up. The make-up artists did a good job in making the dying and dead look dying and dead.<br /><br />SLIGHT SPOILER<br /><br />Although this story started out as a retelling prequel, it ended up faithful to the idea of the once and future king. That faithfulness, in itself, came as a wonderful surprise.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is horrible to use, but it's the only one for Kindle Fire. Takes forever to update. I almost cringe every time I use it.  Sorry but this app is garbage!
B00C5UV3YU|5.0|I am so excited to get this collection of videos by the greatest female group at the turn of the century. I have been patiently awaiting this release for months now. No other girl group does it for me quite like Destiny's Child. This is going to be pure bliss for me.<br /><br />No matter what the line-up may have been, these ladies always brought style, class, looks, clever lyricism and some of the most beautiful harmonies ever. I seriously cannot wait until this arrives at my doorstep. Destiny's Child is my all-time favorite group (male or female).<br /><br />Anyone familiar with this group knows that these videos are truly iconic and have helped cement these ladies as legends!!!<br /><br />I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN WITNESSING THE LAST GREAT GIRL GROUP AT THEIR BEST.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|Different kind of zombie movie.<br />Entertaining in a low key way for most of the movie.<br />More action at the end.<br />Should have made John Malkovich a zombie. He's already scary looking.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Love Nicholas Sparks books and movies - good author and storyline.  The kindle fire HD works very well for viewing.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|Enjoyed the story, but it is a sad one.  Spoke to an Irish friend of mine and told me it was really just like Frank writes.
B0039OC64M|2.0|Boring! This movie is proof positive that some books just can't be made into a film. The book has o be better. Just read it.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I think that the makers of the game should add a lot more maps and jet skies and make it fast.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I like all the sounds you can use alone or combine. All the sounds are of really good quality too.
B00BKRON5K|4.0|I like learning about different diets.  I am a true believer in low-carb diets but I am having trouble dropping the last 15 lbs, so I am going to give this a try.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I've read all of the books in this series and had really looked forward to reading the last book.  Unfortunately, it was not very good.  The ending was flat and almost like the writer had just given up.  I would recommend just reading all of the other books and skipping this one, that way you can make up your own ending, instead of being stuck with this terrible excuse for a final book.
B00C061I3K|5.0|After hearing many teasers about this album I was curious as to what direction the final product would take. Daft Punk is always very unique and progressive with their music, and I have incredible respect for them as composers. When I finally sat down and listened to RAM, I was blown away from start to finish.<br /><br />The album is simply phenomenal, I would consider it a masterpiece in composition. They set it up as a well paced journey with good variety in songs that, if you listen, are incredibly complex with strong attention to detail. The homage to some older genres like groove, funk and disco are well integrated to produce a new, interesting style. The album has to be evaluated for what it IS rather than what it is not.<br /><br />I believe the mistake of many of the low reviews here is that they came in expecting this album to be \\"traditional\\" Daft Punk; as in french house/electronic. Or they expected every song to be like \\"Get Lucky\\" which is actually one of my lesser favorite songs in the album in contrast to certain more varied songs such as \\"Touch\\" or \\"Giorgio by Moroder\\". Too many younger generations were likely expecting modernized electronic such as dubstep, or house and too many older generations were likely expecting it to be a direct \\"70's\\" album simply because of the presence of certain collaborators. You have to listen to this album with an open mind, and evaluate it on an individual basis.<br /><br />This is not your \\"usual\\" Daft Punk. This is something new, and fresh for them; it's an excellent step forward and further defines them as a group. It's much appreciated that they're experimenting with new concepts rather than regurgitating something that's already been done a million times. I believe this album will come to be appreciated heavily as time goes on, it simply comes as a shock to many listeners now as they listen to it with unrealistic expectations.<br /><br />I would absolutely invite everyone to listen to this album from start to finish, without imposing any pretense or assumption. Some might be surprised by what they missed.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|couldn't put is down.  No wonder they made a movie out of the Jack Reacher character.  Lee Child did a riveting job
B00A7W29BE|4.0|Initially, this seems to be easier than another product I tried. I like the fact of scanning on the spot, and having the scan saved into a pdf. This could be one of the most used apps I have.
B00BB67UNW|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and would give it a recommendation for others to view.  It is exciting and keeps your attention.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|My wife is constantly asking me to add fractions for her when she is cooking. This saves me and her both time without having to add it the old way! Whoever thought this up is thinking outside the box, in my opinion.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I can honestly say I fell in love with this novel. I found it by chance through a friend who recommended it.  The plot, the story, and the characters are extremely well developed.  I flew through this novel with ease and would honestly recommend it to anyone.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Something to pass the time away with. I'm not a big &#34;gamer&#34;, but this is from my era so I downloaded it.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Although The Selection hooked me in immediately, The Elite was slightly tougher to get through.  The writing is wonderful as always, but the characters and plot go back and forth so many times, I feel like I'm watching a ping pong tournament. I feel as though the book's intentions are good, but not quite as good as The Selection.<br /><br />Regardless, I am still excited for the 3rd book. Who will win?!
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|This was an over price peace of utter confusion...<br />Acting was good (great stars)...<br />But the plot was so scattered and confusing...<br />I wasted my money....
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.It is a bit eclectic,but if you are  a music lover, it will touch your heart.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Intriguing and intense.<br />Not fond of the partial nudity but the show keeps your attention.<br />Can't wait for season two.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I also have this game on my computer I have replayed it to see if I could beat my own high score.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great series and the movie based on it is good as well. Too bad that it all just kind of ends in the middle of things.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Excellent, another great work by Mr. Sparks. Highly recommend, couldn't put it down. Loved the characters, Amanda and Dawson. Buy it!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|good movie to see again. Watching it before did not attracted me that much as when I watch it again to prepare for this new one &#34;ST into darkness&#34;. Overall I enjoyed this movie and made me wanna follow STAR TREK movies now...<br />Overall, its entertaining and fun to watch! It was worth it to see it again...
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Well delivered, great fun for the whole family. Clean enough for the kids, introspective enough for an adult to be carried with the plot
0525953728|5.0|Both my husband and myself throughly enjoyed this book.  It is extremely well written and it brings the action and danger to your door.  I highly recommend it.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I'm not a sci-fi fan.  This movie was my husbands choice, but it was actually good.  I would recommend this to everyone. Shipped well and was fun to watch.  if you are a sci-fi fan you will love it even more then I did.
B000FC130E|4.0|So this was my first Neil Gaiman experience outside of the two episodes of Doctor Who he's written. I loved it. Richard, our main character, is believable and very out of place in London Below. This lost-ness is part of what endears him to us as he experiences things so far outside of his realm of understanding.<br /><br />The character goes through a fully believable arc, even if the situations he goes through are totally unbelievable (it IS a fantasy after all).<br /><br />It was a very compelling read and I'm dedicated to reading more of Gaiman's stuff. Ten minutes after I finished reading it, I went out and Bought \\"American Gods\\" and \\"The Graveyard Book\\" at my favorite local used bookstore.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the smart, the fun, and the fantastic, well, then this book is definitely for you. Come fall through the cracks with Richard and be enchanted.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Perfect addition of barman movies! Bought for my nephew and he lives it! Watched it as soon as he got it and replays over and over!
013168728X|4.0|This is a good introduction to image processing.<br />The first chapters introduce the readers to the fundamentals of human vision and how the brain processes light, contrast and color. The examples are clear and understandable.<br />As the book progresses, the subjects become more complex and mathematically-oriented. I found that I could follow up with those topics in which I had prior background, like intensity transformations, spatial filtering, filtering in the frequency domain, color image processing, image compression and image segmentation. In these topics I understood most of what they were explaining, except maybe the last pages of each chapter.<br />When it came to chapters where I was weaker or not familiar at all, I have to admit that I was able to keep up only with the first pages of each one. More specifically: Wavelets and multithreshold processing, morphological image processing, representation, fuzzy logic and object recognition. These chapters became muddy very quickly, and I only got a general feeling about what they were explaining.<br />Maybe someone with an electrical engineering background (myself being mechanical/software) would understand better the advanced topics.<br />I plan to read them again once I have a practical need or use for those areas.<br />The book does not contain code samples but it has quite a lot of practical use examples with pictures.<br />In summary, I understood roughly 65% of the book and would recommend it to anyone who needs a better understanding of image processing.<br /><br />Best Regards<br />Ari
B004LWZW7O|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS SO GOOD IM WRITTING IN CAPS. MY SO CALLED FRIEND THAT SAID IT WAS GOOD TRIED TO LIE TO MY FACE THAT HE WAS NOT CRYING. THIS MOVIE WILL MAKE SATAN HIMSELF CRY.<br />#TRUE MEN<br />#THUG LIFE
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Anna Karenina is a magnificent story, and other credible film versions exist. Sadly, this version is a bizzare waste of time and money and more worthy of the title \\"unSense and unSensability.\\"
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Love the game because it is so easy to play it on the tablet  I can play the game for hour now that I have the tablet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a really fun game. subway sufers is kind of like temple run but more easy and more fun.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Love the weapon and skill system. Also enjoy cut scenes. The movement of the character is more smooth than I imagined.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book at the suggestion of my brother and thoroughly enjoyed it. The author gives a good insight into mental illness through Pat and his struggle to deal with it while still making him a quirky and likable character. Highly suggested.
B00992CF6W|2.0|This game is good in survival but creative only has basic building blocks. This game seems like it WAS a test game before minecraft was updated for of and xbox. It needs an update asap.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great match 3 game that keeps your interest with each level. Any match 3 fan will like this for sure.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Excellent show, entertaining without vulgarity and swearing.  I found myself watching this series instead of televsion and get completely lost in each episode
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great thriller, couldn't stop reading until the very end.  Recommend this to all Connelly fans. FIVE MORE WORDS REQUIRED SO THERE.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My kids enjoyed this alot.  I did not watch it myself but they have watched it several times in just a few days.  would buy again
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Just did not like it, story line was ok, acting was bad, I know these movies are supposed to have over the top violence but it was too much.
0449000729|5.0|I have noted with interest the number of reviewers who are not charmed by \\"Sarum.\\" If a person is not enthralled by Stonehenge he might not be enthralled with this epic book. Perhaps a person has to be a Stonehenge junkie to enjoy Rutherfurd's sojourn into Neolithic Britain and the long, long road to the present.<br /><br /> Many years ago, when you could still roam around Stonehenge, I sat on one of the great rock slabs The rock felt cool even though the sun was shining. I ran my fingers over the lichen tracings which were as delicate as lace and I thought \\"hundreds of years from now when I am long gone, this rock and this lichen will look exactly the same as they do now.\\" That was sixty years ago. As the author remarks  in Sarum \\"the glory of the Island was made of stone.\\" If wonders like Stonehenge thrill you, chances are good you'll love \\"Sarum\\"  and the descriptive events swirling around the great astronomical monument are among the best in the book. The superb Salisbury Cathedral is also a nucleus of activity and a reflection of the English spirit and made of stone.<br /><br />This immense novel takes a long time to get through but perseverance is worth it and you'll come away thinking about Britain in a new light because you will feel yourself an observer. You were there when Neolithic men first came down from the North, you were there for the next 10,000 years. In the Fifth century Britain is over-run with the Romans, then Germanic tribes-the Goths, the Saxons-  and the Viking marauders from the north. King Alfred the Great manages to keep his kingdom of Wessex from being conquered by its numerous enemies and from that small kingdom Britain the Island will become England the country, a diverse people under one flag. As the history panorama rolls by you'll visit Norman England after the Conquest. In the fullness of time men will marvel at the great Sarsens at Stonehenge but they have forgotten what the eerie circle of silent giants was for.<br /><br />Sarum follows the lives  and fortunes of five families who lived on the Salisbury Plain- the family of Porteous, the Wilsons, the Masons, the Shockleys and the Godfreys. Families like these and the individual men and women who comprise them, some good, some bad, mold England over the centuries, give it its character, its uniqueness.<br /><br />In the fourteenth century come the reigns of John, the magnificent Edward I and his disastrous son Edward II. Salisbury Cathedral rises from the plain, a church so light and airy it looks from a distance as though it were made of lace. The Black Death, a bacterial disease spread by fleas fro rats, decimates the population of Europe. In the Fifteenth Century Henry V wins the battle of Agincourt. The Tudor dynasty emerges after the death of Richard III. Henry VIII dissolves the monasteries, England is plunged into Catholicism by Mary and Elizabeth I wrenches the country back to Protestantism. She demands the Cathedral at Salisbury to contribute money to fight the Spanish Armada, knowing that the Spanish ships are positioning themselves for invasion. She executes her mortal enemy, \\"the Frenchified Mary Queen of Scots.\\"<br /><br />In the Sixteenth Century James I and his son Charles, devoutly believing they rule by divine right, try to govern Scotland as well as England without  understanding either country. In the next  century Cromwell, the Restoration. Citizens are buffeted one way then the other. The nineteenth century. Napoleon. Nelson. The little frigate called the \\"Euryalus\\" is tucked right next to Nelson's ship the \\"Victory\\" at the Battle of Trafalgar. \\"We were Nelson's watchdog\\" the seamen said.  \\"We were his extra eye and arm.\\"  But Nelson in his admiral's jacket covered with flashing medals strides across the deck, giving orders, an easy mark for an enemy sniper. A concise description of the great battle which destroyed the French navy forever is written into the story. The British nation becomes an Empire, stretching around the globe. Queen Victoria is not mentioned.<br /><br />Author Rutherfurd's authoritative and convincing story goes to the heart of the British nation, to the people who are the country's backbone. And Stonehenge, which had fallen into private ownership, was sold in 1915 to a gentleman for 6,600 pounds. In 1918 that gentleman gave Stonehenge to the nation.he globe.

B000FA675C|4.0|I thought the book was very interesting, but quite frankly I could not see how the world went nuts over it!
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|This movie is terrible. It jumps around so much its confusing as hell. Its a bunch of pointless scenes with alot of characters that look similar and talk a bunch of nonsense. This is the worst film I have seen Tom Hanks in. If you want to be irritated watch this movie.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I love IZ's version of Somewhere Over the Rainbow and What a Wonderful World. The entire CD is VERY good. IZ's voice is remarkable!!!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever!  I will probably end up reading it over and over again!  Scary and heart pumping!  Awesome book!
B00C7O8TSM|3.0|Everyone anticipated the 50th tour and the miracle of not only the original guys playing together but the songs they would pull out of the closet. The song selection didn't disappoint, but...the collections isn't a five or four star collection, I'm sorry to say.<br /><br />Before anyone gets nasty, I am a huge Beach Boys fan. I own everything in multiple formats. They are MY boys. I love them and their collective work.<br /><br />The song two CD set gives us 41 tracks...a great representation of the concerts (which had a couple songs not here float in and out of the performances). It's an improvement over the DVD that included just 20 songs and seemed an unfair summary of the 50th anniversary tour.<br /><br />Musically, they have a good sound. They should: there are a lot of great musicians touring with them. Brian's backing band and Jeff Foskett are as good as musicians as the Beach Boys are/were (if not better). And the backing vocals (which are probably sweetened in the studio after the fact) sound luscious.<br /><br />The problem is that we want the guys to sound like they sounded in their 20s...and those days are long past. Sadly, Mike and Bruce's voices have lost a great deal of the timber or beauty they once had. Brian's voice is an acquired taste. And while knowing the guy who wrote the songs is singing them should be a thrill...it just made me want to go back and listen to the originals. Al's voice seems the strongest of the original team and is more of a  pleasure to hear.<br /><br />And the packaging stinks. Could Capitol have put any less effort into it? There's nothing there for fans to get excited about. A tiny perfunctory booklket with a couple of pics and band details. That's it. No real liners to speak of, nothing to indicate that it was supposed to be a once and never to be repeated event. And nothing to make a real fan happy.<br /><br />This is a CD you'll play once or twice and put away as part of your collection. Good for completionists but few others will find it very satisfying.others will find it very satisfying.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Science fiction is typically not my genre. But I read Ender's Game as a teen and just picked it up again as a young adult. I only remembered it as being a great book, but reading it again I am hooked. It is wonderfully written and explores the future in a way I have never heard of before with the &#34;Buggers.&#34; Ender's Game is an excellent read and I recommend reading and re-reading.

Short, concise, eye-opening journal of what was happening here and There at the same time, as this professional was given the chance to take the journey of a life time, and we have the privilege of reading the log of that trip. Fascinating nearly beyond words, brought me to tears various times.
0812975219|5.0|This is one of those books that completely changed the way I view the world around me. I first read it back in 2008, when I was still very new to the world of finance. Its wisdom goes well beyond finance though. It contains a lot of practical advice on how one should live one's life, and by putting this advice into practice, my life in general has on various levels become substantially calmer and more noise-free.<br /><br />While reading this book for the second time, I also realized that it is actually the best book on trading that I have ever read. You will meet four fictional traders in the book: two wise ones (Nero and Louie) and two amateurs (John and Carlos). A lot can be learned from all of them. In addition, aside from the general theme of the book on how people can be deceived by their own minds, especially when subjected to randomness, the following (sub)sections are particularly worth heeding for traders: \\"Pascal's Wager\\" in chapter 7 (on how good traders conduct their business), \\"The Backtester\\" in chapter 9 (warning against over-optimization), \\"Our Brain\\" in chapter 10 (on the importance of tolerating drawdowns), and \\"Monsieur de Norpois' Opinions\\" in chapter 13 (on the dangers of doggedly sticking to past opinions--there is a nice story about one George Soros here).<br /><br />After reading this book, you will begin spotting things half-baked all around you in life in general. Without giving any personal examples, I will leave you with the pleasure of making such discoveries on your own. Suffice it to say, more than a decade has passed since the first edition of this book, and it seems to me that most people are still completely unaware of its insights. (I confess to having strayed from them far too often over the years, making the second reading all the more vital.)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|You can customize your favourite sounds to relax to with a multitude of sounds and save your favourite mixes. I have had some really pleasant nights of sleep.
1567184855|5.0|My astrologer called me one day and told me I needed to read this book.  2 weeks later I was doing laundry in my apartment building and there it was sitting on the table in the laundry room.  I knew I was meant to read it and once I did I couldn't believe that I hadn't come across this book YEARS ago!  I have read MANY books on past lives but this explains things on a whole new level.  I recommend this book to anyone on a spiritual path or anyone who has lost a loved one or is trying to understand why they are going through what they are going through in life!  THEN READ &#34;DESTINY OF SOULS&#34; right after!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app!!! I especially love the sorting capacity of it. I can organize my thoughts in a way it makes sense to me. I use it to take notes, for a journal, and I even have my grocery list on it, organized by type of food.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's alright I guess.... I have played better and I have played worse. My nephew loves it. He is five.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book has always been such a pleasure to read. I love it more and more with each read. This book should be a constant in any library.
B003D513TQ|5.0|Is a really beautiful movie.<br />I like history, it was a very good performance.<br />So romantic too.<br />I like the movie very much,
B0052U59F4|1.0|So badly written and such little imagination.  If you are looking for good erotica try something like The Story of O.
0743270754|5.0|Team of Rivals is one of the best Lincoln bios I've ever read. While technically, this is a bio about several members of his cabinet, clearly he's the main character. Goodwin hasn't failed me in the previous books of hers I've read, and this one certainly exceeded any expectations I had. I'd begun reading this one a while back, but then had to return it to the library. It was of a caliber, though, that I was inspired to buy my own copy. She offers a great deal of detail about the lives of the key players in the cabinet, without drowning the reader in dry chronology. I felt as is I were sitting in the room watching the story play out, and though I know how it ends, I was riveted. If you've seen the film, Lincoln, or want to see it after reading this book, you'll likely be disappointed. The film is primarily about the passage of the 13th amendment, which in Goodwin's book, covers about 10 pages. It doesn't come close to telling the story of how this brilliant man rose to the Presidency, and once there was the master of his domain. The one thought that kept coming to me as I read this was how desperately our country needs another man of Lincoln's caliber. Maybe one day...
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a marvellous design, why can other manufacturers not offer a similarly priced item? A big thumbs up for whoever at Amazon worked on the product design. It swallows two bodies, 5 lenses, all memory cards, remote triggers, cleaning fluids, cloths, everything.<br /><br />In the outer pocket I wedge a 40L dry sack that can swallow the whole backpack and my smallest tripod in the straps on the side. I just noticed this week that it has another front pocket that I haven't even used yet.<br /><br />Other comments say that the top handle falls off. Time will tell...
B00AALU8IS|5.0|Nothing gross and lots of laughs and thrills.  Boys and girls and jaded Dads can all find something to like in it.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|It was okay.  Read it some time ago and can't remember it, that should tell you something.  I have nothing more to say
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was very up lifting.  The author's sincerity reinforced my belief.  His scientific knowledge of the body and the spiritual made his story more real and believable. P.T. South Carolina
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Shirley MacLaine versus Maggie Smith.  Fireworks!!  Keeping all the storylines moving along.  A consistent winner.  Can't wait to find out what happens next.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|Thought this is a great new show!  Started watching and after two episodes I was hooked!  So glad they renewed it for a second season!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had already watched the movie before reading the book and was very surprised at how the movie follows the book. Cant wait to start book two
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Not a blockbuster but definitely a good feeling movie about a mama and her son. Reminds you to reach out and just love your family.
B0038NN3B4|4.0|Good info, would have liked to have seen more recipes. There is a lot of new information in this book.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was one of those books where you're not 100% sure what the truth is until very near the end, and then there's yet another twist.  Fun read.
0316056898|5.0|If you like Tina Fey, this book will make you like her even more.  Besides being hilarious, Tina comes off as very down-to-earth and honest about her real life struggles (and the fact that her real life \\"struggles\\" are probably not really that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things).<br /><br />I \\"read\\" this book in audiobook format and it was so fun to hear Tina tell her story in her own words - from growing up in Pennsylvania to doing amateur improv in Chicago to Saturday Night Live to 30 Rock (and simultaneously moonlighting on SNL as Sarah Palin while simultaneously planning her daughter's birthday party).<br /><br />Fey made me laugh as she talked about her father (Don Fey):<br /><br />\\"How can I give her what Don Fey gave me? The gift of anxiety. The fear of getting in trouble. The knowledge that while you are loved, you are not above the law.\\"<br /><br />...and her honeymoon adventure, her interview with Lorne Michaels at SNL and even as she described her struggles with being a working mother.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for whenever you want something lighthearted and fun to read.  If you are offended by language, however, this book may not be for you.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|When I started this book I found a lot of humor in the telling of the story, even though there was an underlying sadness based on life the main character was living, due to being controlled by the state.  The last half of the book turns and becomes more poignant.  You'll hold out hope for the protagonist through the end.
B00471TLZS|4.0|I missed Poltergeist in the movie theater. Too many other movies I was watching I suppose. But when it hit cable the first night I was hooked. I'm sure I saw this dozens of times back then. Today is probably the first time I've watched it since the 1980's. It is still an awesome scare fest. Not only does it bring on intense nostalgia but I'm sure I'll be throwing my blankets over objects in my bedroom tonight so I can fall asleep. Great stuff. If you want your paranormal activity, watch this.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Will be topnach #1 English dictionary in the world. From Tony stark. Iron man created and actor in all the movies.
B009ZM74F8|3.0|It been a while since I've seen this, forgot why I didn't choose it as a favorite of mine, but now I remember. Right off the bat the film takes a very European feel, which isn't bad, but different from what i was expecting. Further into the film, the look and feel changes again from a European feel to a very Asian one. The transition, unfortunately is not smooth nor clean as an american style is trying force it's way through the whole of the film. In the end, while the story is interesting, the ambiguous style with which the film was directed only served to bring this movie down from a 4 star to 3.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|If you expected a novel with explicit details you will be disapointed.  This is an excellent account of a man's personal journey through a war that some politicians say doesn't exist.  It definitely does and Kyle pulls no punches in telling you what he thinks.  As a fellow Texian I am honored that he was born here and lived here until his untimely death at the hand of someone he was trying to help.  His character show throughout the book, which was not without flaws.  I also like that Taya's thoughts were included as well.  With her insights this book is an almost comprehensive emotional account.  It is well worth the time.
B009MYARIK|2.0|Not up to par with Kinsella's previous works that i enjoyed. Many paragraphs sound as if she were writing a script for a film instead of writing a novel for a reader to become emotionally in tune with.
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|It's a kid's movie.  I liked it for what it is.  The main villain may be scary for very young kids.  Santa and the Easter Bunny aren't the traditional ones you're used to so they may come across strange to your children, but I liked them.
B00CATSONE|5.0|So many great things could have been... it was a crossroads in technology and we should have taken a left in Albuquerque!
B000SP1SEO|5.0|This performance convinced me of Brad Pitt's skill.  The brogue is *SO* intense yet hysterical once decoded.  The characters are richly developed (including the dog).  Honestly, don't rent Snatched; buy it.  You'll watch it many times and you'll surely loan it.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|fair game, not the best i've played.<br />the clock ticking down is annoying<br />need to be able to do more
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Consistently engaging writing and acting. The production values are mesmerizing in and of themselves making it watchable on that basis alone. Looking forward to season 4 when it is released.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|i love this movie.  i can watch it over and over again.  it is fun and striking. you gasp, cry and sing along
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Wonderful stories of Afghanistan, family, and redemption. Such beautiful scenes this author is able to paint for the reader. Stories not easily forgotten.
0143035711|5.0|I read this for a class I took and found it very interesting to read about the Vietnam War from this perspective.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|I don't see a lot of education coming out of this movie it shows how differently pregnancy affects different women and how we all react a little differently to it. It was cute, I give it that. I wanted it to make me laugh out loud but it was only kinda funny.
0307749347|3.0|These CDs are very hard to listen to, in fact I almost returned them after hearing the first few minutes.  The narrator/author is difficult to follow because he does not differentiate new chapters from subsections in the same chapter. Voice timbre changes, the shrilling of every &#34;S,&#34; and pronunciation of the word recognize as &#34;wreck-a-nize&#34; are disturbing, especially because the author emphasizes to excess his alma mater and affiliation with Harvard University.<br /><br />If you can manage it, the valuable bits start about mid-way into CD 2. Replaying each CD several times was key to teasing out the gems...they are there.<br /><br />The CD could have been so much better if it had been narrated by a pro and re-cast to a non-first person narration.<br />Probably better to read the book instead.
B004PR71JC|5.0|I had wanted to see the film, but I wasn't able to.  Then I got a chance to see it a couple of months ago and fell in love with it and the soundtrack.  I'm a fan of the &#34;feel good&#34; movies.  After my Mom died I needed to feel good or die along with her.  Rio is one of the films I can turn to in any frame of mind.
B0092MJOMW|5.0|Im' a little drunk right now so Igonna talk a wihle a bit without try to sound clichéd. Not much has been said about this album that hasn't already been said before about this album. I remembember the exact procise moment this was released back in '96 ... I was at the<br /><br />my mom. With my mom. (She died.) I\\"ll try not to sound to clichéd but I think this is the fastsst most lightning fast and brutallically fast Metal Album is history and. And if You don't own it you're NOT a true Metal Fan. It goes in your ear like a hot pitchfork. Nothin glike the first time and. And then I borroed this from his Cousin Greg but he never got it back. But that's ok. I have an internet computer with M3P files. Now.<br /><br />GET THIS OR BURN!!<br /><br />The review Comments for the this album are now closed. For all eternity. HELL AWAITS
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|I got this one because Hot & Cold is on it.  I thinks Katy has been doing well since.  I want to add the latest work to my collection.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I have been plowing through the seasons of Dexter and the show is still going strong in Season 5.  There are interesting developments between Dexter and Deb, and the villains get more complex and creative each season. If you liked the first 4 seasons, I would recommend you keep watching!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I enjoy the characters and story but mostly like receiving information of life during World War I.  I will certainly recommend to many others.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Hoping this works getting ready to try....but very excite about what I have read. Looking forward to losing weight and not feeling like a huge slug anymore!
B008ALA6DW|5.0|The connector fits in the mini-display port nicely and isn't loose. It works as advertised and so far I have not had any problems.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is awesome except that the PC is better because it is more eerie. You don't get a flashlight because everything is black and white. Don't let this stop you from buying it because it is still pretty awesome.
B00000JSJC|5.0|Katerine Bigelow is a genius, and this movie is unique<br />I might this will be one of the new classics<br />Juliette Lewis is a sweety pie but is also a cold dark women<br />Angela Basset is a black an hard women with a sweet heart<br />I can watch this move many times and always find how to enjoy it
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I absolutely loved this book even more the first. Great story, great characters and a great romance. Team Maxon! Amazing!
B00C061I3K|5.0|I'm so excited! Just listened to the whole album and I must say, I'm more than satisfied! Robotic vocals on several tracks and a funky disco sound throughout much of it. Two tracks (Motherboard & Contact) are reminiscent of the [[ASIN:B0037KMHRY Tron Legacy]] soundtrack. Most other tracks remind me of [[ASIN:B000059MEK Discovery]] and [[ASIN:B000000WCV Homework]], but there's definitely a new feel to much of it.
B002B79BVO|5.0|Such a well-written and well-acted show! You find yourself thinking about all the symbolism and character development for days after watching.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Refreshing love story with great characters and how to deal with mental illness. Love Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper together
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This is an impressive first novel recommended by a book club member.  I was riveted until the end.  I wanted one more chapter.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I thought the quality of his writing was very poor.  I labored through the pages and had little desire to finish.  Although some of his descriptions were very detailed I found his conclusions, while of course personal, very religious and almost trite.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great and easy to use.  Just what I needed.  I keep it on my carousel for quick reference.  And it's free.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Enjoyed this movie, but I don't think it is memorable. Good acting and keeps your interest, but not a movie I will remember.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|I decided to try it based on all the positive reviews.  The description says it works on &#34;Android devices&#34;.  I have an Android tablet.  My tablet has only a front-facing camera, not a rear-facing, but I figured I might be able to lay an item on my chest where the camera could see it.  Seemed worth a try.<br /><br />I got the program downloaded, but it refused to install.  Just said my device was unsuitable.  I can only guess that it looks for a rear-facing camera.  If so, it would help to say that in the description so people like me will realize not to bother.  If that's not the problem, it would help a lot to program it to tell the user what it saw that it didn't like.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|This was quite confusing. Perhaps better to have read the book as it moves too quickly from scene and timeline.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this game so much! I got sooooooo  jealous when my brother went and got this on his iphone, and now its on kindle! this game is awesome and allows you to express yourself.
B001O1O71C|5.0|this book is amazing and heart brokening at the same time i think every kid should read this book that is how good it is
B0064X79JC|3.0|The book was fantastic to read. Yet the quality of packaging was horrible. The book was used. The cover of the book had wrinkle creases. The pages had folding marks.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's an amazingly amazing game. I can't live without it.love it. Get it you'll never want to  stop. Great for everyone
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I mean come on it has a demon monkey and a cursed idol<br />If a strong Christian read the description they would have<br />Not bought it
0152465073|5.0|I loved the story.  Other reviewers mentioned that this translation is better than the newer one.  I haven't read the newer one, but this one is certainly great.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. It is really good. One thing I have to say is that I am waiting for the 0.6.2 update.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|The story line was fun but the issues and struggles Ralph had were true to life.  The animation was well done and the dialogue was sharp and entertaining.  Even though my granddaughter had already seen it she asked to see it with us because she thought we would really like it.  She was right!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A very fun game that gets the mind thinking.  The problem solving game that involves any age.  Our kids play for hours.
B00A7YZ1KI|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I restricted myself to reading it on the train and at lunch only but I still finished it within 36 hours of purchasing it!
0307454568|3.0|The first two of Stieg Larsson's novels in the \\"Millennium Trilogy\\" are great. The last installment, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,\\" is only great when it's not tedious, and it's often tedious. This book is easily 150 pages or so too long, and desperately needs a skilled editor's attention. That said, when the book works, it's excellent and gripping entertainment. \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" is only worth the time of people who devoured its pair of predecessors, and are very eager to know how the trilogy ends. Otherwise, there's little to recommend this book as a \\"stand-alone\\" read.
B005HEPOKU|4.0|Originally I got this to see Terri Hatcher's guest appearance but I got a surprise. This episode is hilarious! I think even non trek fans would laugh their head off.  A famous comedian has a guest spot but I won't tell.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Honest, insightful, smart, awe-spiring and uplifting!  I can't say enough about it.  We could't wait to read the next words!  An excellent read and well-written.  Love it!!!!
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|Okay, so the illustrations aren't warm and fuzzy but it's creative and different. I love it because it's the first book my son learned to read so it'll always have a place in my heart. The repetition really helps for early readers and it's fun to read out loud as well.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My new favorite game! The premise is simple but mastery is not! It's fun to try to make it further each time you play. Earn points to better equip your car by driving farther, doing flips,  and by collecting coins. Fun,  fun,  fun!
B0094LU2TU|5.0|This movie so ingeniously encapsulates everything that is post-modernism. I happened to watch this movie for the first time while taking a literary criticism class and several of us in the class agreed that this movie would be perfect for analytical fodder.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|This book was amazing<br /> Thought chapter 11 was a little slow, I enjoyed it very money much. The end was the most surprising part though I should have seen it. I would defiantly recommend this book to friends.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|My kids and I love a good that uses your mind and I like that it has no violence, which is hard to come by now days.
B00932AA5G|3.0|OK, all you reviewers who loved this movie. Explain to a no-doubt clueless viewer what happened in the last 15 minutes of this movie.<br /><br />All these security guards, and other apparently high-ranking officials, too, were gathered around the bank of monitors watching what happened in the cottage. They didn't call the police.<br /><br />Then the focus of the movie shifted to \\"reputation,\\" as if the entire thing had been an exercise of some sort? Was that it?<br /><br />Please -- help me out here. And don't be mean.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|I love this author, he is new to me and I love the way he writes. Nothing is as it seems where he is concerned.<br />lots of twists and turns, you never know which end is up.<br />This is the fourth of his books that I have read!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Not feeling bloated anymore and no more diarrhea  and bad stomach cramping! Used to think I was food poisoned but  it was actually wheat!!! Even now if I eat bread(whole grain organic etc) I immediately bloat and my whole body feels puffy! I eat brown rice and feel great!!!!
B00A88FLI0|5.0|My six and seven year old sons really like Ninjago and legos so this was a perfect gift for them.  They really enjoy it.
B004LWZW42|3.0|I have no complaints about amazon's part in delivery of this movie, it arrived promptly and in very good condition. the movie itself strays a bit too far from both the established movie storyline and the classic comic book storyline for my liking.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I've never written a review so bear with me...<br />I absolutely loved this book! It's written in a refreshing way and Drew's POV is hysterical. You gotta love this guy. In the beginning, I thought \\"what a jerk\\" and by the end I was cheering for him. His transformation is absorbing. I couldn't put it down. The book is well written and progresses flawlessly. For me, the author's ability articulate and tell a story intelligently is really important and Ms. Chase doesn't disappoint. This is one of the many reasons Emma Chase has just become one of my new favorite authors. (that, and it's just freakin' HOT)!<br /> Can't wait for her next book!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|this isn't the greatest game in the world but it isn't the best either I timed it 14 mins and 56 seconds thats berally enough time for anyone to do anything in the demo they copy Minecraft AND NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO COPY MINECRAFT!!!! and they cant say that they like Harry Potter around me.<br /><br />  --Belatrix's daughter
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series has practically kept me on the edge of the cliff, I like the way it builds. The second book definitely shows a good transition into the third book leaving it the way it did.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it ws veryfun the best horse game that i have ever played in my life so far it is awesome.
0753541637|4.0|A lot of space was wasted citing older studies on women in the work force that we've all heard before, but there are several lines that held deep meaning for me that I intend to use and use often. There were a few modern insights that really hit home and probably will for a lot of women who read this book.  Personally, I was hoping for more than just a &#34;woman's work versus woman's family life&#34; comparison, but that appears to be the focus of the author, so that's what you get.  Overall, I would recommend it to others, especially men who may not be aware fo the histories we still struggle with.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I am always so excited for the next g5 game. They always make me use my brain and challenge my memory. Can't wait to get the next great game.
0060594888|5.0|The Success Principles makes the best, and I do mean the BEST graduation present.  I gave 15 books out. It will be very interesting to see the outcome from the graduates' responses. One of the graduates has read the book in one week and has her life smiles ahead of her.
B00C70FH7M|5.0|I typically don't write reviews for Amazon.com but I feel compelled to this time around because this album is simply magnificent.  I am a long-time progressive metal fan and I have to say that Tesseract is one of the most unique, dynamic, and impressive bands to recently arrive in the genre as well as the \\"djent\\" prog-metal sub-genre.  In this album, the band combines intense syncopation, bone-crushingly heavy guitar parts, mind-blowing poly-rhythms, lush atmospherics, pristine production value, catchy grooves, and generally astounding instrumentation with soaring melodic clean vocal harmonies.  My favorites on the album include Nocturne and Eclipse but I would advise you to listen to it all at once considering it is composed of one long prog-metal suite.  I would highly recommend this for fans of bands such as Dream Theater, Opeth, Periphery, and Pain of Salvation, among others, or just of good, memorable music.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really fun game, I like games like these, there good time burners. Reminds me of Theme Park and Jurassic Park Builder, highly recommend.
B002PEP4C8|2.0|I really tried to like this book.  When I was bored with its self-indulgence (which was more often than not) I forced myself to continue until I finished it.  There was nothing unusual about the book in any way.  I am familiar with the crime of rape, and found Sebold to focus more on the horror of her assault than figuring out how and then working on recovering as much as possible from the heinous experience.  Sorry.  I really tried to like the book, to no avail.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is  an amazing awesome spectaculaire game!!!!That any person of any âge could love!!! I know i do!!!and i AM 11 years!!!!!!!
B007HC3LHS|3.0|This book skips around in time, so it was a tad confusing remembering the time period I was reading about at any given moment.  I also didn't like the court transcripts used.  It just looked weird.  As far as the story itself, not bad.  This was either a free or super-cheap Kindle edition, and I feel like I got my money's worth and perhaps a bit more.  The author's writing style didn't actively bother me, so that was okay.  The characters were believable and I came to care what happened to them.  All in all, a decent read.  I'd recommend this book to those who enjoy the crime, mystery, and thriller genres.  Not a light beach read.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is an amazing book and I would highly recommend it. The storyline is beautiful and the characters raw and real displaying the emotions of life with poignancy.
B0019I6WDG|5.0|My husband and I have watched &#34;Juno&#34; multiple times, and will likely watch it again!  It's funny, sad, realistic and a treat to see the wonderful performances by all cast members.  I would recommend this movie both for teens and for those of us who have been around the block a time or two.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|It explained a lot about Kanban that I didn't really know before with real world scenarios. It was a fun read and I finished it quickly
B00BR476TG|5.0|The message tries to be deep, but no matter what you think of what they are trying to say, the movie is beautiful and the story interesting.
0393339882|5.0|I've read a number of books on quantum mechanics, and some are good while some stink. This one shines, and it's totally deserving of its 5 star rating. This is the first I've ever read that presents a thorough history of the development of quantum physics. I had never heard of half of the great scientists who contributed to this awesome achievement. The book is very easy to read, and Kumar explains each step in the process in both a comprehensible and very interesting manner. Kumar deserves the plaudits of all amateur scientists for writing the best book on physics I've ever read. Read this one first. Then the rest.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Great game for kids. Daughter has really enjoys it. She Has needed some help. But over all a fun game for kids.
B004HO6I2O|4.0|A great date night.  Not suitable for the kids at all.  Not a deeply meaningful movie, but fun and stupid fuuny.
0307476073|1.0|So, I picked up this book at the local library (thank goodness I didn't pay for it outright) after reading the book jacket.  I was hoping for some memorable PCT moments - beautiful descriptions of scenery, towns, people, and experiences - but instead was extremely disappointed with the utter lack of \\"appropriate\\" descriptive content.  Maybe a shocking memoir (I'm thinking it might be more fiction than not) replete with sexual promiscuity, animal brutality and a totally obscene lack of preparedness to hike the PCT was the only way Strayed thought she could break into the writing world.
B00867GHS8|4.0|...so good it's almost sickening. Be prepared fr the ulitimate 3D experience. Although &#34;The Avengers 3D&#34; is a better adult movie, this is great for the whole family.
B004LQI1PA|3.0|I saw les miserables on stage years ago and I thought it would be like that. The singing was fantastic but without them actually doing the play, it left me wanting. Please find an actual stage rendition so my kids and I can enjoy it at home.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|I am a Hugh Laurie fan (Dr. House); but, his CD was an amazing surprise.  I heard him on one of the late shows a few years ago with his &#34;garage band&#34; and was impressed with the talent.  So when I had the opportunity to order the CD, I did so immediately.<br /><br />Just so you know, I am not a music expert, but enjoy all types.  This CD was kind of like a quick trip to New Orleans.<br /><br />I definitely look forward to his next release.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Fun game and neon provides a nice touch.  My family enjoys all the flow games and play them again when we finish one.....keep them coming!
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|This is one of the best band documentaries of our time. The behind the scenes footage takes you back to the 70's California music scene that includes some really cool cameos. This set tells the truth which is not always pretty & the music is there for the whole ride. It is a great set for Eagles fans as well as music fans worldwide!
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Loved fruit ninja but when they made th h he upgrade my virus protector says that&nbsp;it's&nbsp;malware and forces me to delete it
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love playing bingo blitz. I have been playing it for a few months. Hope everyone has as much fun as i do.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I actually didn't absolutely chose this series, but come across it by various seasons, all not in numerical order, but once i did complete my entire set.  I absolutely could not get away from my tv, this series is so addicting.  I loved watching it.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Nothing to write home about, and not worth paying for. My biggest complaints are that it doesn't have as many characters as a normal virtual keyboard,  so chars like the ' that is on the keyboard key ~ is unacceptable for passwords, when it mistakenly autocorrects a single word to two you cannot undo the auto correct, and when typing a long text, it doesn't give you the ability to scroll through the previous texts as the text scratch pad envelops the entire screen.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|This didn't sream well onto my Samsung TV.  It could have been an issue witht the television that was purchased through Amazon as well but all of the movies I had previously purchased had very few issues/delays while streaming.  This paused several times and skipped parts.  This was very confusing with this movie because it jumps around so much.  Was only able to watch about 1/3 of the movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Love the book, loved the story line! Loved the characters! Could not put the book down. Loved that it was not a thrilogy
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It is an very interesting and well done show.  I plan to watch all the episodes in each season.  Yes.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Lovely!!! I just loved it. I can now put my D7000 body, 2 lens (18-55, 70-300), Sony Cybershot and few other stuffs not related to camera ;)
B004856SQ8|5.0|This was actually a awesome remake from the tv show it was full of action and comedy. This is a must own for any fan of the tv show.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I've just started but I'm on level 5 . it is so fun. it is free ; very cute I will tell my friends
B008C0C1Y8|5.0|Stallone is Judge Dredd the future world was awesome and on blu-ray it is even better. The action is non-stop.It's a must own if your a Stallone fan.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Another bonus that I did not pay one dime for.....my Amazon bonus points paid for it!  These are great movies and nice packaging.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I loved it.  I thought the entire book is a vry beautiful love story.  I do not care what people are saying - it is a very good book.  I am unable to put it down.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|It is an awesome game to play!<br /><br />I always want to play it when I'm bored and I let my 2 year old sister play it to keep her quiet
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I have not read this one as yet, but I am certainly going to order it soon.  I am still reading the second one
B00A7W29BE|3.0|OK, I didn't read the description of the app thoroughly but I thought it can recognize the scanned documents as text files, but it cannot. It can only make photos of the documents, it can convert it into pdf and enhance the the text on the picture. So it has some good ideas, but it is not what I thought. But it was free :-)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a good story:  good triumphs over evil  and the human spirit reigns supreme!  Considering Augie's situation from so many different angles and characters' perspectives really helps the reader identify with Augie. I don't think I would have understood the plight of permanent disfigurement without this &#34;lens...&#34;. Well done!
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Arnold is at his best when he is chasing down and killing the bad guys. In this movie true to form, he chases them down and delivers justice. I enjoyed the movie, albeit the was a little thin. I like Arnold and just about anything he does that delivers a blow to the bad guy makes me happy.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Highly addictive!! The graphics on the kindle are amazing! Easy to play! No lag time like some of the other games!!
B00006FDCD|4.0|I like Stephen king and like to terrify my spouse. I like it. he hates it. I want to terrify him
B0067EKYS6|5.0|I eagerly waited for this movie to come out and it did not disappoint me at all.I watched it with the expectation that it would be mildly entertaining and fluffy.Instead it had me in tears the last half of the movie hoping events would change.  I recently reread the book and Leonardo DiCaprio played Gatsby perfectly. The attention to the little details really made it a beautifully tragic story that i could watch many times and not get tired of it.<br /><br />I've seen the movie twice and love the many layers beneath the glitz and glamor of the larger than life parties that Gatsby throws. Even though i knew what would happen with Daisy and Gatsby, the way the events played out was both heartbreaking and fascinating to watch. It reminded me of watching an accident knowing what will happen yet being unable to change events set in motion long before the final tragedy even occurs.<br /><br />Seeing the story from Nick's POV really showed that beneath all that glamor there was a dark side to living the fast life. I was initially skeptical about the music but it was blended perfectly in the party and dramatic scenes, it did not feel out of place at all. I've been listening to the soundtrack non-stop this past month. I could go on forever but in short...this movie is so unique and reminds me of Moulin Rouge in some respects. I am a big fan of Baz Luhrmann and it was well-worth the long wait to see this stunning movie P:)
B0053TWW1I|4.0|I have not saw this movie sense  I was a little girl and im into vampires. I like it its cool
B004TTHLBE|4.0|Very readable and nothing like I was expecting, Gaiman's typical dose of fast paced Fantasy is wrapped around a bit of Mystery. Some of the players appear in other Gaiman tales, but this simply adds a touch of credibility all around. A good read.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Vikings season one is a great show..I am hooked and love the ability to watch it at my own pace.
B0093LINVK|5.0|Short version - if you're looking for the best HTPC or XBMC box this is it. Great performance, small size and virtually silent. What more could you ask for?<br /><br />Long version - I've been using Boxee Box since it launched for my HTPC needs in conjunction with a NAS. However, recently the Boxee Box has been struggling with the size of my library and with some of the higher bit rate files. That and the fact that Boxee have stopped updates meant that I've been on the lookout for a replacement. With XBMC being the predominant home theatre software the software was decided but there is a plethora of boxes. Eventually I decided to pay the extra and run it on a full fledged PC. I picked the NUC over it's competitors for a variety of reasons:<br /><br />- core i3 vs atom and AMD system on a chip processors (for future proofing)<br />- small size<br />- good looks<br />- virtually silent<br /><br />Overall I am ecstatic with this device. I configured mine with 8gb RAM and a 64gb SSD running Windows 7 64 bit Home Premium. The performance is blazing. It boots into XBMC in 15 seconds and will play anything you throw at it (unlike some of the Android and embedded XBMC devices). In addition it acts as a VPN gateway by sharing out my VPN connection<br /><br />Visually it looks pretty cool being very small and with the glossy black top. I've never heard the fan but it is there.<br /><br />Cons are few and far between. It doesn't come with the needed cloverleaf power cord so make sure you order one. Some people are bemoaning the lack of USB 3.0 but in my usage streaming from a NAS this is a non-issue. A built in IR receiver would be nice, but the USB one I'm using works fine. I managed to damage my wireless antennae while connecting it to a WiFi card so be careful in handling it. Also I had a wierd issue in Windows 7 with the NUC not staying connected to my switch at 1000Mb speeds (it would flap constantly) so I had to lock it to 100Mb to resolve this issue.<br /><br />Overall,I would say this is the best XBMC/HTPC solution for those streaming from the network.
B000W94FE6|2.0|I feel the vast majority of content in this book is unnecessary padding around what could be compressed into a tenth of this book's size. Endless stories and anecdotes may help hammer in the setting and reasons behind the points the author wishes to make, but there is little enjoyment and flow to be found reading this book.<br /><br />Find a summary somewhere, and only if that doesn't give you what you need get this book.
B000IJ79WU|1.0|This DVD wouldn't run in my Blu Ray/DVD player, and everything else does . . . I hope somebody is not dumping a malfunctioning product on the market here.
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|Seeing this remake movie made me fall in love with Evangelion again.  The original movies were just a summary of the series, but this kinda isn't.  Some things have changed but I like that.  You'll be surprised of how great the animation is.  Watching 2.22 will also be great.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Excellent read filled with plot twists and 80's nostalgia. A must read for any gamer that loves fantasy and living their childhood. Personally loved the Columbus references as its my home town. Highly recommended!
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Loved the anime. This movie series will be better than the original. A lot more fan service as well. You will not be disappointed with this movie.
B001HN6922|4.0|Great movie. The only thing I've noticed with this and the one we borrowed before buying this, is that it only works on 2 out of 3 of our DVD players. all other dvd's work on our main dvd/bluray player, but this one doesn't. It's not old either, so i'm not sure what the hangup is.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|There are a lot of choices of different sounds.  The layout makes it very easy to understand and use.  Best sound app I've seen.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|It was great to see Jamie Fox in a different type of role. The movie was great to watch, put your feet up and enjoy.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is great I have always enjoyed jewel games and this one great and  a challenge will definitely recommend it to my friends and family.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I love this game but why am I unable to connect to my Facebook or my GL live account? It's frustrating I want to continue playing but I can't get enough hearts because I can't connect with my fb friends to earn hearts. I trust I'm not the only person with this problem. I even went so far as to restart the game, hoping that the problem would sort itself out. I'm going to be deleting it for good. Btw the costs of finishing this game is ridiculous! I would have toiled on if it weren't  for the connection problems.
B004ULEEY8|5.0|I think a lot of people missed the point of this movie.  This movie really has nothing to do with an alien invasion.  That is merely the catalyst for the story just that same as it was for the movies \\"Signs\\".  This is a movie about U.S. Marines and an Air Force member who despite overwhelming odds in the face of an unknown enemy, do their jobs.  They are always moving forward.  It is a movie about duty and service before self.<br />To me, this is a wonderful movie that pays tribute to the men and women of our armed service, just as Battleship did for our Navy and their retired.  Great fun.  Check it out.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Great and fast read. I read this book after the news broke about the women kidnapped in Ohio which made this a little more intense to read. A great perspective to tell this story from the child's eyes.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|its great game to pass large amounts of time on<br />its a great time killer I can tell you that much. I enjoy playing this game and it work perfectly on Kendle
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I will be buying the 4th season as soon as it comes out.  I loved the three seasons and will be watching them again in the near future.  They are spellbinding to watch.
B00C7KYXHW|3.0|It is ok but I cant get by the role of Hanibal, the Actor does just not fit. They should have found someone better to play the part.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|I'm the kind of person who likes to expand on my musical options all the time. Instead of being a mainstream and close minded person, I bought this album, the CD. Yes, people still listen to CD's, and I can honestly say that I love every single song on this album. I even skip Pumped Up Kicks sometimes. Because there are actaully BETTER songs on this album then that one. Yes, its fun to jam to, but it isn't the only good song. Trust me. I love music, and I don't lie. Check out their stuff, and if you don't like it, your crazy cause it is amazing. BUY THIS ALBUM!!
B003TQKVGU|5.0|I've several different books on the power of positive thinking and applying the principles of the power of the Universe. I rate this book higher than most on this subject due to it's easy to read and practical applications - mostly in the form of  affirmations - delivered in everyday and down to earth language.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Best game ever I loved it but my kindle fire had to restart and now it won't let me load it
B0012HRJEA|3.0|I was too distracted by Mr. Gatsby!  I loved this movie when it first came out.  My daughter is old enough that she's started studying Shakespeare in school.  I thought it would be fun to watch this movie with her to help her see the timelessness of the story.  I only made it about thru their wedding night.  Then I remembered that the really boring exiled part was up next.  I asked if anyone would mind if we just skipped the rest and everyone quickly agreed.<br />I have trouble with older movies.....so, take this with a grain of salt.  I still love the soundtrack!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is awesome because you can create your own little or big village and then you can start to expand it far and wide. You can also add or invite your friends into your world and let them see how big your village is compared there's and also have a competition.
B0051XSKSU|5.0|We LOVE Kung Fu Panda II at my house.  For kicks, I rented the first movie again to see if the kids remembered it.  It was fun to see it again. Po is just so darn lovable.  It's a feel good movie with NINJA's!! Jack Black is awesome, too.  There's too many good things about this movie.  You should BUY instead of renting.  This is one you'll enjoy seeing again and again!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this App. The calculator is really big, and easy to use. Works great on my kindle. No problems with it.
B000MVN8GK|5.0|First off, start with season1.  It'll mean more if you watch them in order.  Season 2 was a little random for me, but I really liked the way they pushed it forward with Season 3 (in college).  We are all looking forward to the Veronica Mars Movie next year! (thanks to a GREAT Kickstarter campaign--the fans have spoken and we want more!!)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An extremely intriguing story for any thrill seeker! This book kept me in the edge of my seat the whole time and spent an hour at a time reading it. The imagery is incredible and the book itself is also kind of a twisted love story. This fight  for survival is perfect for Anyone looking for a high action book.
B001A5HBAG|1.0|I didn't like the way they treated the women.  I didn't like the pasties.  The commercials made this look so much better than it was.  Maybe I should have watched more than one episode, but I just didn't want to.  I thought it'd have cool advertiser stuff in it like we got with Sam's husband in Bewitched.  Instead, he worried about what to say til the very end and then spouted off some stuff we all know already.  It was....lame.  Sorry, you might like it.  I just didn't.
B00985E3UG|4.0|This is scary stuff.  Think of the repercussions for our children and what they will grow up doing to their bodies unknowingly
B003VVFGWC|5.0|Season 2 wasn't as good as season 1 or season 3.  It was still great, but there has to be a last place.  Still, it's best to watch it so you know what's going on in season 3 or you'll be really lost.  The characters are fun and engaging.  The puzzles are fun and challenging.  The script is tight.  There's a lot of good things going on there.  I guess it reminded me of Buffy the vampire slayer.  Not because of the bad guys, but because of the comradery.
B00000IQC8|4.0|its okay but i liked the second more still you got to watch this to understand some jokes in the 2nd
B00BESM14U|4.0|I thought this would be more light hearted than it was.  They took a hard look at what it's like growing up through the highschool years with serious social anxiety. It was like the kind of movie your doctor would make you watch to help you sort through lingering issues.  I didn't connect on the passion with music that they shared, so that might have made it better for many of you.  I do enjoy watching Emma Watson in any role and look forward to seeing her in more movies.
B00563M11M|5.0|After reading abolut 20 of Pratchett's novels, this is one of the best. I am partial to Sam Vimes and lady Sybil, and it is a joy to read this book with the usual humor and literary jokes. Recommended.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I really like the Lark Rise to Candleford series. It is very entertaining. I will watch the whole series. I recommend it for anyone who likes a good story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it! its super funy for me and my kids.  The graphics are amazing, so realistics and the moves of the horses are totally same at the real life.
0553386697|5.0|Very impressed with how nice the condition of book was in! Thanks :) Great book on learning how to understand the brain!
B00847KFDS|4.0|I bought this from walmart, after I heard it was a remake of old songs I thought \\"WHY\\", but now I know, 1.they are great songs, 2. making them with other artist is a great idea, they do not sound like CCR songs, I am very pleased, have already listened to it a couple of times and its still in my car player. Buy it and enjoy CCR songs from another angle..
B009ZE27US|1.0|It work the first time you try it out; but when you get other contested to try out the app; the age is way off. About 20 yrs off. It would be nice for the app to be accurate with the age after the first prediction it makes.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I wish that I could have read this book ten years ago.  Every educator and social worker in the New York York City system system would do well to  read this book.
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|Loved it, not only is the movie one of the best ones I've seen, but the soundtrack is awesome, I highly recommend it to all.
B004LROMWU|5.0|Waiting on season 2  to come in. Can't wait for season three to start on June 9th! Noah Wyle is my hero. =0)
B000R3NNDQ|5.0|Meting icebergs are all around us. Metaphor and feelings, used together, can become a powerful tool for change. Inspired leadership must get us through these challenging times. This is so well illustrated by a simple story of a colony of penguins struggle to evolve and overcome their problem.  How very refreshing.
B0033TJATW|5.0|Every MJ fan needs this one. I remember when it came out. Even thought they may seem a little cheesey, MJ was very good at telling a story in his videos.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|This program has little functions and yet the effects it helps give to your art and pictures are breath taking and all you need are a few clicks and voila. In this case less is definitely more.
B009CG0102|4.0|This movie will probably go down as the best historical depiction of an Apollo Saturn 5 launch and a commemoration of an incredible period of NASA history. I was a kid when the Apollo 13 accident happened and remember the world holding it's breath hoping for their safe return. This movie captures it very well.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|First of all, it's free.  But in a very clever and useful way.  If you prove to James that you read this book - and he gives you plenty of easy options on how to - he'll refund your cost or donate the amount to a great charity: Women for Women International.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever seen that done before.  I like it.  He's so confident in the value of his message - a message that made him wealthy - that he's willing to forgo any money.  All he wants to do is make sure that you read it.  He chose himself to succeed and he wants to make sure that you choose yourself as well.<br /><br />Even if I hadn't followed his amazing blog for years, I'd still read it just for that.<br /><br />Another important thing: He's honest.  Painfully honest.  Tells you about how he made money, lost it all and hit rock bottom, and how he raised himself through it to become a major figure in media on the internet.  And he did it all by going outside the box.  Everything he did, he did himself.  No middlemen.  No one choosing him.  He chose himself.<br /><br />And that's what the rest of the book is about.  Working for old corporate, the nine to five, the 401k, the dream of owning a house (or it owning you), all that society taught us gives us happiness - that's a big lie.  James shows how to create real wealth and happiness, how to create your own destiny.<br /><br />Talking about when he hit rock bottom, he says, \\"That's when it clicked. When everything changed. When I realized that nobody else was going to do it for me. If I was going to thrive, to survive, I had to choose myself. In every way. The stakes have risen too high not to.\\"<br /><br />That nails what the book is about.  Not only does he give hope, he inspires and shows exactly how he did it, the details, and how we can do that ourselves.  And it's really well-written and lots of fun to read.  Of all the books available to read, this is one that shines.
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|Very hard to watch. How in the world did this movie receive such acclaim? Such simplicity misinforms more then informs.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is great! Since I've bought it, I've had sounder sleep and have been more relaxed. My favorite part about it is the ability to pick and choose the sounds you want! There's so much variety and not many prapps of this kind let you do that! Get this app and I promise that you will not regret it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is awesome.  It's just hard enough to keep you engaged, but simple enough (with some hints) to not want you to just give up.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The story quickly grabbed my attention and kept it throughout  the entire book. I can't wait to read the next one!
B006L7S8YG|5.0|Oh, The Places You'll Go,\\" is what I always give.<br />The perfect road map for how folks really live.<br />Gift it to Graduates...

B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|The whole idea of the Jack Reacher series is the SIZE and STRENGTH of the man...his physical abilities, his power to intimidate.  Cruise is just the opposite...the scene of him without the shirt was embarassing when compared to Jack Reacher as described by Lee Child.  The movie is a bust.  If you are a Jack reacher fan DON'T WATCH IT.  It'll break you heart.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|Great book!  Was disappointed that the zombies didn't win.  It was like kitchen soup for the undead soul...a collection of short stories about the only apocalypse worth having.
B0087ITBPC|2.0|I think the movie would have been great and I love Barbra Streisand; however, the movie kept locking up in the second half of the movie....so there were parts I didn't see. I have tried it on several DVD players and it just doesn't work.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|I have seen this before but the rent from amazon was an easy and great experience!! I will do this again soon
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Hill climb racing is a fun game. I told my friends about it and they downloaded it. Now they all love it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Good way to pass some time. Seen the app decided to try it, glad I did. Some strategy needed but not to much that you can't relax and enjoy the game.
B0096HL33G|1.0|Did not care for this movie at all. For me it was not worth the 2 hours to watch it.
B002ZP1STK|5.0|Wonderful film of a child prodigy whose gift is his connection to music. Perfect match to the many children being discovered on the talent shows shown on YouTube today. Great feel good movie
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Amazing beyond words. As always Mitch Albom delivers with heart-rending creative talent. I explored every emotion known to man. Simply astounding.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It is fun to a degree.  gets boring after a bit of playing and I have a hard time trying to exit.  For a free game you can't beat it though
B00B1OWEVC|4.0|When I first heard of How to Destroy Angels, I was surprised to see Trent Reznor back making music with Atticus Ross. When I saw this album was coming out, I was very excited, because I have liked HTDA before this album, and it still had that NIN sound, but a more electronic pop sound that I really like. I bought the album on Vinyl, and I am surprised. Beautiful artwork, from the talented Rob Sheridan, and the singer, Mariqueen Maandig, is a very great singer for HTDA, and her voice goes really good with the music. Coming with the vinyl, was an extra CD of the album. Also, there were extra tracks \\"The province of fear\\", and \\"Unintended consequences\\". There is also a slightly different track order on the vinyl edition. Very great album, I am happy with how it is!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|i really did not buy the app but i know it will be awsome so i think you should get it i love it because it is free so i bet it would be great
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Gary doesn't beat around the bush, there is a coherent message throughout the book which he does not want the readers to miss; he provides more than sufficient scientific data to justify his idea.
B0089LOG02|5.0|i really enjoyed this book. I did not know a lot about the orphans from this time period and how they really suffered! Great Book! Thinking of using it for my book club.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'll miss Sookie, but Charlaine Harris did a great job of letting me know how everyone is going to be, and wrapping up all the books!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I ordered this app based on the rating, and I feel very comfortable giving it the rating I chose it on, a 5 star.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|The character was nerve wracking and the film in black and white made it stark and surreal. Couldn't watch more than 15 minutes of it. It irritated me - like a nail on a blackboard
B000PMG16U|3.0|These 3 are not the first movies out.  It was explained to me that these three are the last three.  Oh well.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Amazing and inspirational!! Very moving definitely two thumbs up!<br />Wonderfully written and I highly recommend it to anyone. Loved it
B00BQ1DATU|4.0|Good follow up to Fields. After multiple listens, still finding additonal things that I like about it. If you liked the last album, this one will satisfy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think this is a well written book. The other books ( Hunger Games and Catching Fire) are also amazing. The books can bring out some of your emotions, though.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|You don't have to be a buddhist to enjoy this film - it's a super adventure, full of twists and turns that will set your mind reeling!  The actors are all to be commended on their awesome performances;  it was the acting skills that impressed me the most, however, the familiar concept of one person making sacrifices for the greater good is the theme that touched my heart.  There's plenty of action and much that a lively mind will enjoy here!  Watch it!  :o)
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Utterly and completely blown away by this book. The series comes roaring back to life with rich characters, amazing plot lines, vivid images, incredible twists and turns. George Martin is incredibly gifted. One of the best books I have ever read. One of the very best in the entire series. Pure genius Mr. Martin. I applaud you Ser!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook so why wouldn't I have this app on my Kindle Fire?  It's easy to use, and I can keep up with my friends on the go.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a Facebook account.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|The trouble with these book series is that the story seems to be left hanging in all but the last book.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|This is an interesting game.  It's not really my style, but that's not a complaint.  Even though I gave it five stars, I didn't like it.  However, that's not due to the game itself.  I just didn't like it.  It wasn't for me.
B002W7J3SO|1.0|was unable to watch. i want a refund not able to watch give me my money  when do i getmy money
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I really liked this game until I couldn't play it anymore.  I have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and for some reason after awhile it started freezing up when I started playing the game.  It looked like a TV with snow on it.  I tried to reboot my Kindle several times, but it never resolved itself.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Very cute movie. Highly recommend for Tweens! My daughter loved it and I thought I was goings to fall asleep thru it but turns out I was laughing my butt off in some parts as well.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I was looking for an alarm clock for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  This app was perfect.  I've used it several times.  It's easy to use and you can customize it to fit your needs.
B0034G4P9E|3.0|Firstly - the motivation is terrible. A Physics teacher who between he and his wife \\"have 3 jobs\\" and can't make a house payment - that's silly. My gal is a teacher and she makes good money..if this guy can't manage his money I don't really have a lot of sympathy for him. Secondly the other brother goes AWOL from the Marines and is allowed to keep fighting -- umm, they would have arrested him on the spot.<br /><br />The performances are good but the script is well intentioned but full of holes.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a calculator app for my Kindle.  I didn't want to pay for one, but I would have if I couldn't find something good for free.  This is exactly what I was looking for.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Works like a regular jigsaw puzzle, you will appreciate the ability to carry it with you, never lose a piece and you don't have to flip the pieces over. You can come back to it, later, if you need to put it down. Now I can work on my puzzles without listening to husband complain about the mess.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Les Miserables is often called France's national story, but it's a<br />story the whole world loves. So, its story's a winner, but what does<br />this movie bring to its telling?<br /><br />All the key elements of the musical have been kept. The movie does add<br />two things at the start that the play could not. Views of the French<br />countryside let us see how far the government could reach to continue<br />hounding Jean Valjean. More importantly, Hugh Jackman shows us a dirty,<br />wounded beast of a man. Jean Valjean's papers labeled him a dangerous<br />man, and his injured spirit and anger made him more dangerous than even<br />he knew. This makes the transformation by kindness that much stronger.<br /><br />This movie also brings in a tad too many shots of singing heads.<br />Cinematography should be something you notice only after watching the<br />movie. I noticed it, but this wasn't enough to derail my enjoyment as I<br />watched. This movie develops the story at a good pace: moving along<br />without rushing things.<br /><br />Some have criticized the vocals. I'll admit, if this movie was \\"Javier<br />Sings,\\" it would have fallen short of a good experience. On the other<br />hand, with Russell Crowe's force of presence, his raw vocal style<br />complements his performance. Overall, the staging, the pacing, and the<br />acting enforce the drama of its music.<br /><br />Les Miserables is one of the great stories of the human spirit, and<br />this movie delivers its full impact.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|very good but I hope that is not the ending Will there be another? Please let me know when and if that happens
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great series.  I tuned in to Season 3 and discovered I loved the series but wanted to know the things that had previously transpired.  The characters are so rich I felt I wanted to know them from day 1.  I recently subscribed to Amazon Prime and as I was browsing through the list of perks from the membership, I found the first two seasons of Downton Abbey!  Oh, I had a fine time watching the episodes at my leisure on my iPad.  5 Stars for the storyline and acting; 5 stars for Amazon Prime; 5 stars for Amazon.com.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The story of this book, with its twists and turns is spellbinding. But what I actually enjoyed most about it is the quality of the writing. Gillian Flynn has created a voice for each of her primary characters that is incredibly authentic. Her ability to capture the thoughts and mental outbursts of the character left me feeling completely engrossed in each of them. One tiny negative observation: Ms. Flynn is so clever with the voice of each character, that it sometimes borders on the too clever. These phrases sometimes took me out of the story and back in to my own role as a reader, rather than a voyeur watching something real unfold.<br />AND, this is one the most well-written, most downright enjoyable books I have read in years!
B0045HCJQW|5.0|I find a new aspect of this film every time I watch it. Has been a favorite for more years than I care to admit.<br />Cary Grant is a gentleman comic at its best.<br />Katherine Hepburn is perfect as the wealthy WASP.<br />A must see movie for all generations.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|Title says it all. I didn't expect the end. I would of gave it 5 stars but it started off kind of slow. I would definitely recommend this book to my girlfriends.
B008OHV4PG|1.0|Needs more music and less talking. Spends to much time driving and giving the tour of his home town. I like Neil;s music and thought there would be more.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I went into this book just looking for something to read on a long flight. What I found was a remarkable story with so much more than I originally thought it had to offer. I assumed it was sad, little love story and that would entertaining but not deep. I was completely wrong in this assumption. Read the book, don't give it another thought.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculator.  Large buttons, easy to use, and access to many kinds of calculations. Definitely an awesome app for being free.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This story is told in a fast paced, gritty, narrative that is even more amazing because it really happened.  If you're a fan of military history, or think that the current generation doesn't measure up to those that preceded it, then this Autobiography will amaze you.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I've read the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, and this one is pretty much the same book. I found this one more repetitive than the others, though: lots of Masonic motifs over and over again. Filled the plane ride well, though.

B0083O0ZHS|5.0|If you are an ABBA fan then there is no question you'll want to have the deluxe edition of this album for the excellent performances, videos and behind the scenes glimpses on the dvd.

B004R2HGMC|5.0|From the 1-2 punch of the title track and The Winner Takes It All to great album tracks such as The Piper and Andante Andante and familiar tunes like Our Last Summer, On And On And On and Lay All Your Love On Me this is a solid effort through and through.  Add Spanish language bonus tracks and an awesome dvd of videos, television appearances and a short documentary and this is a must-have album!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I had jst opened this application, my televisin was on, but turned down low. I wa tuned into one of those Time-Life music collectin programs. As soon as this application opened, it pops up with &#34;Coming Around the Bend&#34; by Credence Clear Water Revival - which was the particular song on the television just then.  Amazing!
B008TT7CXW|5.0|This thing is great! I needed something to house the micro memory cards from our phones. This is exactly what we need. Because there is room for the larger SD card we can use those slots for the SD adapter that came with the microSD cards. Perfect!

B000001E29|4.0|I actually got to see the play in Los Angeles.  Jack Nicholson happened to be at that particular show.  It was truly a play accompanied with a live Waitsian orchestra.  The perfect place and time to invent that word or whomever's already used it.  I was fascinated by the saw.  I'd know it to be used for making music in the past but to see it effectively used here was just amazing.  The lead actor who later said he is a cousin of k d lang, said that he couldn't help but sorta sound like Waits vocally singing throughout the show, both as it's hard not to given the songs and as an homage to Waits.  It seems to me that Mr. Waits did here what he did on some Orphans songs.  He could have simply had a cast recording released but, instead, did the vocals himself.  He is not in the play, he just wrote the music.  But for this album, he's done the songs he wrote for us.  And, though the lead actor/singer did a great job it is a treat to hear Waits do the songs.  As a result, this is another Waits album.  There may be too much story for some but all his songs stand alone and this package, all related to the story of the play, read/listen/hear like an album say of a rock opera or some other themed record.  I sure wish there was a dvd release of that play but, as with most plays, that does not appear to exist.  It'd be great to have a cast recording of the play but that doesn't seem to exist either.  However, having this record is certainly much less than table scraps, really, what it is, is Waits doing us the favor of singing the songs he wrote for the play and then releasing it all on this cd, a very kind thing to do for Waits fans.  I first heard/saw him on the Mike Douglas show in apparently, 1976 on TV.  It was love at first sight and I've been a giant fan ever since.  I do prefer the One From the Heart soundtrack and earlier material to material released after that (1982) but I keep stumbling on records after that that turn out to be better than I'd at first believed.  I've since decided that Rain Dogs and Swordfishtrombones both fit in very well with the high quality musical output he had prior to that in basically the 70's.  Really, since Beautiful Maladies (which as a greatest hits for I guess his 80's period is a stand alone gem of an album musically, one of my all time favorites) everything after that I take cautiously and have yet to hear an album since then that really sways me as much as those to Beautiful Maladies and before.  Maybe that's just taste or maybe it's that he's, least it sounds this way to my ears, come past his magical period of making music that stands the test of the decades and into the uncertain future and instead is able to make music, with a few wonderful tunes but mostly, functional, yes, always interesting, but not songs that just pop like those earlier records.  I always felt like Bone Machine was the start of that 'sorta' decline.  Ahma gonna have to revisit that album too (I'm sure I have all his albums) cuz, who knows, even that may turn out to be brilliant or have some afterall.  I do know that only today, after hearing the samples for this record have I given this album a break.  For years I just undervalued it and now I consider it with a coupla gems, as usual post Beautiful Maladies, and, especially since I saw the play, something I'll go back to a few times again in the coming years, should God give them to me of course, cuz we never know.  Each day's a gift ain't it.  ciao.ve since decided that Rain Dogs and Swordfishtrombones both fit in very well with the high quality musical output he had prior to that in basically the 70's.

B007MCTTHY|5.0|At first I got this game for myself to play and I kind of forgot about it after a while.  My 6 year old daughter was playing on my phone and started playing this.  She figured it out and completed almost the first 30 puzzles on her own!  Honestly I thought it was a little difficult at first but you figure it out as you go.  It does increase with difficulty as you move on and she needed more help with it but I still think it was a fun game.

B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|If you're a fan of the show &#34;Nashville,&#34; this cd will whet your appetite for more.  The songs' lyrics/music are well put-together, and there is a nice variety of artists performing.  That said, today's cd's usually have more than 11 songs, so I think this collection should have had more tunes.  The cd arrived in a timely manner, and in good condition.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|This book is a well written story with a great message behind it about the perception of life and the relation between spirituality and story telling. It succeeds at keeping you engaged and the end doesn't disappoint. Overall I enjoyed reading it and also learned a few things I didn't know about wild life and survival in the ocean.
B005F3XV62|5.0|I am a big fan of this guy and his movies never cease to make me laugh out loud!  It's great to see a movie that is so funny that explicit sex scenes aren't necessary.

B0070UFMOW|5.0|This is a great product and a nice addition for anyone who likes good, loud sound. Be careful though, as it is capable of overloading the inputs to some devices. It is especially useful for splits and when you want to turn the volume down low on your source device to save battery.
0345529057|5.0|These books are fantastic! If you like the medieval times and twisted plots then these books are for you. Irresistible to look at without wanting to pick one up, and impossible to put it down.

B00005N7Z1|2.0|This movie was a sensation when it came out, but a hopelessly over dramatic look at a cartoon that was acted out with actors.  They were not great actors, and the movie was not either.

B00CRR5YA0|5.0|Great new music, but takes the 2009 Star Trek sound track to \\"get it all\\", as will no doubt happen again when the 3rd Abrams movie is released.  I judge the track \\"Klingon Wartet\\" as a true loser, especially the first minute or so of \\"noise\\".  But with the bad comes the good and the opening and main theme are truly beautiful music.  French Horns reign supreme!

0345803493|2.0|This book was a not so decent follow up to the first book. It was a bore trying to get through this one, that when I got to book three I was too tired to finish it.<br /><br />First, the most likeable character in the series lost his appeal in this one. Christian was hardcore in book one, and a huge softy in this one. He had Anastasia on his beck and call in book one, had her taking his orders, but this one he is begging like Keith Sweat. Anastasia on the other hand, was too damn stupid for own good. Like did she not realize her e-mails were monitored? That is what annoyed me the most in the book more than anything. The biggest let down was that Kate was gone for mostly the entire book. Anastasia is just not that interesting by her stupid ol' self.<br /><br />The sex scenes were overdone, repetitive, overdone, repetitive, and overdone to the point where you would rather read the plot than the sex scenes, which are the main hype of the series. The writing was still as awful as it was in the first book, I guess the publisher didn't care that the writing was that bad as long as they were making money from the books.
B00BSN0K1C|4.0|First, a word of warning: the actual figure does not resemble the one shown in the picture. The actual figure has a slightly different head sculpt, a noticeable 5 o'clock shadow, and the outfit also has a bit more texture on it. Okay, with that out of the way? Onto the review:<br /><br />The Superman Man of Steel Movie Master action figure is, by and large, a very good figure. The first thing you will notice is how heavy is it. The whole figure is cast in a very durable rubber like plastic that should stand up to play. The paint application is done very well, with not a hint of bleeding or slop anywhere, and the overall mold is nicely detailed and rich in texture. Please take note that the cape is not cloth, but rather a sizeable, molded, piece of plastic. The cape is flexible, but not in any way poseable. The figure is pretty much the same size as the Dark Knight and Green Lantern Movie Master figures, and would fit nicely in with that line. It's nicely proportioned and not overly muscle bound like other Superman action figures.<br /><br />As far as articulation goes? The head is on a ball joint but does not tilt up far enough so as to be put into a flying pose. The shoulders are ball jointed as well, with a mid-bicep swivel and single joint elbow. Both wrists rotate but lack up and down articulation. The is a swivel joint at the waist, and the hips are the type of joint anyone who collected DC Universe or other Movie Masters should be familiar with - meaning it's a peg joint which offers up and down rotation, but they have a flange which provides the legs to be swung out wide. There is a mid-level thigh swivel joint and both ankles can go up and down. All in all? I counted 20 points of articulation, not bad.<br /><br />The figure also comes with a stand in the shape of a Superman S shield.<br /><br />There were a few things that I did not like with this toy, namely the lack of a better head joint and the complete omission of an abdomen joint. Without these, it's pretty much impossible to put Superman in a realistic flying pose, and c'mon, it's Superman! Flying is what he does. Another point is that because of how heavy this figure is? The ankle joints are going to take a beating and get loose in a hurry if you have him standing on your shelf. The base doesn't really do anything to help this, in fact? It makes standing the figure worse as he easily comes off the stand.<br /><br />All in all, this is a pretty good Superman action figure. I would definitely recommend it. Please take note that this action figure, found at retail, goes for $15.99 It can be found with a little hard work, it's definitely easier to find than the General Zod or Jor-El figure. If you can not find it and are really dying to own one? Then I encourage you to go ahead and order. You won't be disappointed.retty much impossible to put Superman in a realistic flying pose, and c'mon, it's Superman! Flying is what he does.

0345803485|3.0|I will say that I slighty enjoyed reading this book, the plot was good, although it was oddly similar to that film \\"The Secretary\\" with Maggy Gyllenghal(which was better), but the execution itself was poor. The writing was pitiful, the author didn't do any research on American culture, and dialogue, nor did she know that there is no college student in this day and age who doesn't function without an e-mail address. And lets not get to how many times I lost count at how much Anastasia \\"flushed\\" through this book.<br /><br />The many women enthralled by this book must not be getting it on the regular because this was purely BDSM for beginners, nothing too steamy, and nothing that popped out as interesting. From the hype I was expecting something more hardcore, the plot itself was much more interesting than the sex scenes if you ask me. The only real good part of the story was the Graduation. There were many times I flipped through the pages and was like \\"WTF??? is this really a best seller???\\"<br /><br />As for the characters, the only likeable characters in this story is Christian because he was smart, successful, and down right scary. I honestly wouldn't see any woman putting up with his demanding foolishness, unless she was a money hungry gold digger with no self esteem, and into having sex with no strings attached. Kate was also likeable because she let Christian know that she was NOT the one. She was the only one with some real cojones. As for Anastasia, she is dumb as rocks, I honestly don't get the hype about her, she wouldn't even be able to keep a man like Christian in real life if you ask me. Men like Christian use girls like Ana as props and for a good time, not for long term relationships. Her stupidity gets worse through the next two books. This book would be so much better if the main heroine wasn't so stupid and annoying.

To me, Suits is sort of the legal/law firm version of White Collar. Also, it has a great supporting cast. Especially the actor playing Louis Litt, Rick Hoffman. That character is a fabulous dork, offering much comic relief, while also giving a certain sweetness to the show. I look forward to season three.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|#Nemo's Reef is a great, non-violant kids game for Kindle and other tablets. My son loves the concept of earning money and spending it.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Well done film noir style movie based on true story of gangster Mickey Cohen played by Sean Penn.  Josh Brolin does an excellent job in the role as the cop trying to stop crime in Los Angeles.  Great story, casting, acting, directing, sets, wardrobe, and music.  You will feel you are in post WWII Los Angeles.  From the daily lifes of the cops and their families to the gun battles in the warehouses and clubs of Cohen you get a great view of what it must have been like living in LA.  Great rental and probably well worth adding to your library.<br /><br />Recommendations: [[ASIN:B001N3OJEG L.A. Confidential]], [[ASIN:B000I3UI7E Untouchables]], and [[ASIN:B00008L3U3 D.O.A.]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|It's cute, but just wasn't much there.  Wanted me to buy extra stuff, so I lost interest in it quickly.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I have played many Mahjong games and have found that this game is the most challenging. I find it fun to sit for hours and try to figure out the elaborate puzzles that this game presents. It lets you choose from over twenty game set-ups, all which are as invigorating and fun as the last!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Horse lovers will enjoy this one.  Lots of levels to achieve and the graphics are really top notch.  If you can't actually own a horse of your own, this is almost the next best thing.
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|I enjoyed this game. It is different from the games that I generally play. Give it a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at the replay value!!
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Very pretty visually, but I'm new to this game and hard a hard time figuring it out.  Probably worth my time to do that because it looked challenging enough.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Living  a dull retirement in a marriage turned sour Harold decides to post a letter to a dying friend what happens next well you must read the book to find out. Suffice to say I thoroughly enjoyed the journey
B00B2V66VS|3.0|A little too fast for this old timer, but my 6 year old granddaughter can fly through this.  I was very impressed with her eye and hand coordination.  If you like a challenge, this one is it.
B0036S4B2G|4.0|I liked this book a lot. It is a fun read, and it made me think about the way think (inception). What I mean with this is that it gave me a new way to see things, from the business side of it, which is something very new to me.<br /><br />I recommend this book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is perfect for a read on the weather in your location and others.  Loads quickly whenever I access it, and radar maps are always current.  I love it.
1439170916|5.0|Who would ever expect a book about cancer to be a page-turner? It was riveting. I brought it to bed with me every night. I've already got friends lined up to borrow it. Read this book! It's compassionate, informative, compelling...chock-full of facts, quotes, and anecdotes...I can't remember another book from which I learned so much.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Had never played Angry Birds before and had heard so much about it, that I had to see what all the hype was about.  Well, it's cute and if you like AB, this must be pretty good.  It does get tougher as you go along, so if you like the challenge part of it, this is pretty good.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|read the first book, followed right along. good story line. easy reading, will read more of Jeffrey Archers books thanks
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a good, basic Mahjong app.  Tiles are a little small on my Kindle, but then my eyesight isn't so good anymore.  Very challenging because so many tiles are similar, but not exactly the same.  When I want a good and challenging game, I go to this one.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|read the book, it follow the book closely , loved the actors, will watch other episodes. a little racy in some scenes
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|So far this game is great. ive played twice for 4 min to an hour and like I said so far I like it. good job GAMELOFT, Really Good job.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|It a good game. I like playing it. It is fun and somewhaat difficult.  .  It is a very challenging game.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I liked the idea of going out to post a letter and ending up releasing a past that was strangling the life out of his most important relationships.  A good story brought full circle with a redeeming end.  Read it!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Para poder ler alguns e-books encontrados na Web e ouros documentos, precisei baixar esse aplicativo e estou muito contente com o resultado!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This is a good game for the price not paid. I have played many games in this  genre and this one is comparable to some and better then most. The zoom is not the best and graphics are midlevel. Had this been one of my first experiences this would have got five stars do to a creative storyline, responsive touch and ease of use. The game guides are helpful but not intrusive. The story keeps you interested. I recommend giving it a shot as it is one of the better games i have tried.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|I paid for the full season 3 and half of it was part of season 2!! I could have saved myself $16! What a rip off!
1616550414|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of the Zelda games must have this. The book itself is a work of art. Every page springs to life with lively, beautiful artwork and awesome information.<br /><br />I can't really say much more than what has already been said in the other reviews. Buy this book!
B0058O84G0|5.0|very accurate historic facts and details, including social background,  very nice picture of the pre-war diplomacy and also nicely written
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really love this game it is a very fun way to pass the time- and it works really well on my kindle.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|No real plot but a fun movie to watch. Stupid at times, but if your into a \\"B\\" rated type movie and don't expect anything grand then this is it. I like the \\"gore\\" and reminds me of a horror movie. Don't expect much from it. I wouldn't pay $14.99 for it...but it would be more expensive to take a family of 5 to the movies to watch this so it balances out. I would wait until its free on Prime or when it gets down to $2.99 for rental.
B008602KQI|4.0|If you had not read the book it could be hard to tie in the flashback scenes. Movie has a flow and engages the viewer yet has the usual cast of only utilizing beautiful people do enthralling, interesting, and dangerous tasks.  Production wise it was a bit glossy compared to the book, but a movie audience full of kids do not care about production only the entertainment factor. During the movie She loses her tree rope in an earlier explosion scene then has it again. She had a spool of wire that she could have tied to an arrow to aim at, then reel the items to her, instead she resorted to the plethora of dumped apples into the minefield. She never questions Peeta for why he was leading the patrol of kids to find and kill her. Where does she keep getting all the arrows?
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|I decided to give this show a try and couldn't stop watching it. It has great acting, unimaginable murder scenes and story line. I am recommending it to everyone  know.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|Wide ride with tense moments when you think they may twist the plot. But it's straight forward story or a family<br />Trying to make a vacation a dream, but the worst happens, everything coming around in the end. The script was<br />Too simple for a true thriller. However, it will entertain families, who could later talk about &#34;what would we do&#34; in tragic<br />Circumstances. Ok film for one look.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable and hard to put down. At least the third time I've read it and still find it fascinating. Makes you think- from first to last word.
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|This was a horrible lackluster excuse for a film, I want my money back!<br />The script, acting and editing were absolutely inexcusable.<br />These two actors, where did they come from? Well send them back.<br />The children actors looked somehow off from the &#34;white&#34; culture of the<br />Script. It was trying to recreate 'sleeping with the enemy  'and the 'the notebook'<br />SAVE YOUR MONEY SPEND IT ON CANDY!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I haven't seen the movie yet but the game is loads of fun to play.  My kids love it too.
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|...... And well acted. These two play well off each other ...they make you believe in fun happy love. Just sit back a enjoy the fun.  Jake gyllenhaal show he has reach for many characters, and script. More in Hollywood would should trust his talent.  Go Jake
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I play several games...most of the others are Scrabble-like.  But this Dice with Buddies game is the one I go to first!!!  If you like Yahtzee, you WILL like this!  So quick and easy, but still involve luck and strategy.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|We get that dose of the 1950's we long to relive on a adult level. This bio pic takes you behind<br />The scenes of a true auteur at work and at home, a view many must have had interest in Hick's<br />Life. Acting top notch, wonderful sets and designs, script successfully fills in the blanks of what rumors<br />We many have thought about Hitchcock. No one doubts his talent but to also see he was a very human<br />And perhaps misunderstood in his kindness. Enjoyable on many levels see it!
B009G7WUME|5.0|Stars are for the release, but in my opinion the vinyl is not terribly great.<br /><br />I am a bit anal about vinyl and bought this from amazon brand new.  Packaging was great, vinyl looked fine, no warping, etc.  I put it on my vacuum record cleaner and cleaned it up nice and then played it.  I am getting a good deal of sibilance across all tracks and the last track on each side has a lot of inner groove distortion that makes the sibilance even worse.  Its not unlistenable, but its definitely a downgrade from the CD in my opinion.  I'm running a Clearaudio table with CMB and a Grado Reference sonata cartridge, so decent enough equipment.  Kind of a bummer, but if you shopping for this vinyl expecting to outclass the CD, you will most likely be disappointed.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|I loved the first two books and waited anxiously for a long while for \\"The Best Kept Secret.\\"  I did not care for its loose ending, only a publisher or book seller would love that ending!  Until the last few (20 or 30) pages the story was good tying history and fiction in a yarn.  But those last pages were superbly written, AND A SHOCKER!  Hey, I always thought a trilogy involved three of something and this is/was a trilogy...??  Is there to be another book?  Not sure if I'd ever buy the fourth book in a \\"trilogy\\" but it is tempting.  Read at your financial peril, this story could go on for a looooooooong while!
B000SEI230|5.0|I love the way Mr. Sparks writes, getting me so involved, like i am right there. He always has a way of touching my emotions.
142314189X|5.0|Really good books. Fun to read and reread. Love the fact that they are hardcover so they can handle use and misuse.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Perfect ending to a perfect series!  I have read it completely through about 10 times ans probably will again and again.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I wish I could log in and listen to my personal playlist. So far I have to put in each video in the search to watch them.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was a great book, I couldn't put it down! It held my attention all the way through! Awesome book!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|My wife and I love watching the development of the two Broadway shows and the competition at every turn.  Too bad the show was cancelled.  We watched every show from the beginning to the end.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I have been using the large size for some years.  When I saw this more diminutive package, I knew it was perfect for my Smoky Joe AND my Big Joe.
B00007AJF8|5.0|I am Being John Malkovich. This is a true story, it is based on my life. Or maybe I made it real. Slaveho, Pineapple head, and matt I mean Scott I mean Janene I Am are dead because of me. I am John Malkovich. Why do I sound like Cameron Diaz? I dunno. I just killed a ho. Who is the ho? Matt Cutty is the ho! He is dead because of me. I zapped him into an alternate universe between space and time so I could beat him mentally and physically for information. He told me everything. And now he goes to jail for life. Being John Malkovich is real. Slaveho (Amy Whartnaby Favretto) and Tim Brown (Pineapple Head aka Nothing aka No Name) will die in jail because of me and they are my little helpers! I killed Matt Cutty with my mind. And Jason Hannold is next. He will die in jail and hang himself with a bedsheet. Then John Scanlan will die. In jail as I torture his mind and whisper in his ear until he can't take it anymore and I make him run in front of a car with my mind and this time I will concentrate on the car and the car will run him over. He will also die in jail. Fred Gayburn is dead because of me. He has Hep C and I don't. Matt is yellow and has Hep C. Go to his house and take a look. Justin Gallo, Mark Bruns, Tim Cahalan, dead fat roomate, Brian Sheldrake, and everyone else I want dead dies. So does Captain Madonna, Pecko, Brian Wearshing, Brian Slattery, Pete Beisser, Dave O'Brien, Brandon Rickards, Jackie Edwards and Edward Basile and everyone else that set foot in my house. I am John Malkovich. Die b*tches! Signed, Your worse nightmare.
B004G606K8|5.0|I enjoyed reading this story. Looking forward to the next in the series.<br />I would recommend the book to anyone e.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Wow! This book is great. At first when you read it you think, wow I eat like crap and feel a little guilty about they way you eat. But Dallas and Melissa map it all out for you and make it easy to put down the bread and walk away and I have never felt better since eating the way the book tells you. It is hard at first but the benefits are amazing! I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to change their diet with out going on a \\"diet\\". Easy, fast and super tasty recipes are included and both my husband and I are loving the 30 day challange! A must read!!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This tale appears plodding at first but soon the reader becomes engrossed in this story.  This is a tragic tale. What begins as a familiar slave - master story has many twists and turns as the story evolves.  I know that that there were better plantation owners and slave masters ... at least I hope so.  i also know that there were many cruel plantation owners who turned a blind eye to the despicable overseerers they employed. This story will disgust and horrify as well as captivate the reader.
B007YJS7G4|3.0|Liked the premise behind the movie-it just seemed a little \\"hokey.\\" It's such a sensitive subject, and it feels like it truly doesn't receive the full credit it should've for the amazing sacrifices our soldiers put on the line. Fighting for their own country when we wouldn't even accept them. Also, for WWII buffs-there are some MAJOR historical inaccuracies. If you are one who can enjoy a movie w/out always thinking back to the historical accuracy, this would be a great movie to watch. Impressed by the theme and the intentions of the movie...A+ for intentions...C- for follow-through.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a super cool app. It's  a must have!!!!! Trust me!!!! Once i started i couldn't stop!!!! You won't regret getting this app!!!
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Be very careful with this; I downloaded it as a free app of the day, had it for a few days and had to delete from my Kindle....malware!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoy the book.<br />I couldn't stop reading. I have read it  3 times now and I can't get bored.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|play at work on break and lunch thanks.also will play when i am waiting some place. thank you very much
145210655X|5.0|I gave this as a baby shower present and the dad loved it. I was so excited to be able to give him something that he loves and wants to share with his son. Looks like something they will be able to enjoy together (and sometimes independently!) for years to come!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My sister told me about this book. I used to mentor a young adult discussion group at the public library, and she told me it would have been great for that. She was right! I definitely recommend this book for Tweens, teens, and adults. Two thumbs up!
B000RO9VJK|5.0|Must reads for business starters. This book describes common traps for starters, and provides analysis and shows how not to make it happen.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A fun game that I don't have to pay total attention to, I can be on the plane. Fun game
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is probably my favorite app I have.  I like the math problems I have to do to shut off the alarm.  This is, of course, just one of many options. It is too much of a pain to do a thorough review on a phone, but to be short, best alarm clock app period.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|There are lots of mundane trivial pages of words. The only interesting part was the escape and I wanted more for an ending.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|From the era of 30 years ago it would of been ok, today... Cheesy as hell. Weak story, predictable plot.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This was a well written and informative story about a subject I knew little about.  Another reminder of how life was hard and not for the faint of heart in our American past.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|I was a tot during Marley's era, I knew as an adult he was good, but this documentary made me realize how good he really was.  I have a new found respect.  Great movie for all.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was fun and challenging. I enjoyed the graphics and the sound effects. The puzzle was engrossing. I wish there had been more levels, but it was definitely worth the price. I am looking forward to more. I did not expect such a well developed game on this platform.
B0095P29EG|3.0|I enjoyed the movie from start to finish, very entertaining. I would recommend to lovers of super hero movies.  Rent it!
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Show is amazing can not get enough of it and hope it sticks around for awhile. Just watch it you'll love it too.
B0091VTISO|3.0|It was cool to watch has DVD, glad I didn't pay for two at the movies. It does have entertainment value.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I just love that I can download or copy documents and then send them to my kindle to read at my own convenience.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the app is great but some of the games are hard to control while some are great the games can get a little boringvat times
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Nice choices of many ambients good to relax ,,, love it !!! You'll love it too don't hesitate and download it now !!
B001UGB1X8|2.0|I thought this fell into that general catagory of time line , ghostly contact and self examination themes , It just didn't grab me in any particular way , Like Tommy Jones generally though , just this one didn't do it for me.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Fantastic movie. Enjoyed the mastery of Denzel Washington. He is truly able to capture the essence of any role that he attempts to portray. Very enjoyable viewing.
B0093LFXIG|5.0|A must read for all fans! Its a fun to read, informing book about McFLY - I couldn't put this book down :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|does what i need it to do, a very capable, simple calculator.its best feature is that its free.all in all Im not unhappy to have downloaded this application.
055357342X|5.0|The complexity of the storyline is amazing, and the diversity and uniqueness of each of the characters makes them believable. The series is as always a joy to read, however some long awaited moments seem rushed only for the sake of...who knows. Perhaps this far in the books, with few villains left to uncover, and taking the gore for granted, the shock factor is lessened. Regardless, SOS has equally satisfying moments that keep you hooked.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I would like to see a go-cart on here. and make it so there would be a road so it can go on. also a bicycle would be nice.
B005LAII80|3.0|Only the blu-ray was included with no digital copy or ultra violet. This is not the only time this has happened.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|If you like HOG then this is NOT the game for you. There is NO story line, POOR graphics, NO characters, NO h.o.g.'s, POOR games etc. etc. etc..<br />And I have NO idea how anyone could solve this without looking at the hint guide. I am deleting this immediately. I really shouldn't use the word solve because there is no real investment in any story or characters. If you were one of the people who gave this a great review the please go to games (on Kindle Fire) and enter hidden object and you will find plenty of GREAT games that completely blow this out of the water. I would not have liked this even if it had been free. Thankfully, it was only a dollar. Please, if you liked this game, take my advice, you don't know what you are missing.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|This was so good I immediately wanted to download the 3rd book on completion. Come on Mr Follett , get writing.
B002CMQS1O|5.0|The internet has changed so much, yet so little at the core of the music business.  All wannabe young musicians should watch this (or maybe a remake for today's world is needed?)
B005JE1KD8|4.0|this is a good follow up to the farseer trilogy which always felt like Fitz needed to do some more
B00CW665VI|5.0|I don't comment on books too often, but I couldn't NOT review this book! It kept me laughing practically the entire time. Loved the story and the writing in general, such a great point of view. Will definitely be following thus author.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|All the charactars are great actors and actresses.  The story line keeps you interested thru out the season.  Best series I have seen in a long time.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten. Hope this fulfills my required word count... does it? Yes.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love this app it . Is so creative who ever made this app is awesome. I would recommend you getting this app.
0756686970|5.0|The pages are colorful and the pics of characters are big enough to keep a kids interest.  Each page has different facts about each lego figure/character.  Its a great reference book too.  Great product.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. He gave his life to God and his life was turned around. That goes to show what God can do in your life when going through hard times.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a great game. The puzzles keep me interested. Good graphics and music. The story line works okay. I enjoyed the game.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Is way too cool and you can use diamond and plasma centers to buy stuff and the way Tony flies is awesome and I really like the game.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This was a heart werming story about two boys I wish it would have been longer well over all it was a great story
B007BT0RKG|1.0|hard to navigate and only downloads certain areas. not what i was expecting as a navigational map. only downloads the state you live in. not very convenient when I travel across a 3 state area.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love The Big Bang Theory because it's well-written and well-cast.  The scientific content makes the comedy unique and fun!  The characters' witty banter makes you feel like &#34;one of the gang&#34;...and makes you care for each and every one of them.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I like it because you can unlock things, it's not just about having money to upgrade.  I like the new characters and the upgrades with the characters.  It's my favorite game!  Im eight years old, perfect game for my age.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Growing up this was part of my childhood. They are not Picture of the Year worthy, but they hold a special spot after reading the books
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|This is a very difficult movie to watch. It's three hours of your brain trying to figure out the connection between all of the different time periods. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if it had been a shorter movie, but not being able to understand what's going on for almost three hours was not enjoyable.
B009JBZH54|4.0|For me the best went 2nd, 3rd, 1st. The second one set the tone in my mind while the third did a nice way of &#34;wrapping&#34; it up. The first for some reason just seemed slow and nothing special.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This is a great action flick. Very humorous and clever. It's Bruce Willis at  his best. A lot of fun.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|This is an excellent crime drama with many twists and turns. It keeps you engaged the whole time and I highly recommend it!
B000SEIDR0|5.0|My first Michael Pollan book.  I will read more.  How he kept my interest and awe for over 400 pages, I can not explain. A tasty meal for my mind, my foraging, shopping and cooking life.
B00C7DGRL4|2.0|Great cast of actors, but it begs the question why would they want to be involved with this movie. I am a scifi/horror film fan but this one was pretty lame.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|This is a marvellously crafted film. But you have to go in cold to fully appreciate it. So I would say don't read any reviews first! I never say this!!<br /><br />That said, I don't think that the film depends entirely on surprises. I would watch it again because given what was going on in the overall plot the acting was especially subtle and the psychology especially interesting.<br /><br />Extra features are bits stitched together from interviews. Okay.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|He does it every time; a masterly written detective book which has you on the edge of your seat. Make sure you have the time to read all the book over just a few days. It's worth it.
B006PTL1QM|5.0|I really appreciated this film. That said, I am about the 130th review and I think both the 5 star and 1 star reviews have something to say. So I would advise the potential viewer to read some of each and be prepared for a slow film with some flaws, but on the other hand some very nice work and important things to think about. This is very much in my opinion an \\"ideas\\" film, but also some compelling character themes.<br /><br />I don't have much to add to the various reviews except to weigh in and say that I think the flaws do not outweigh some of the very positive aspects and do not diminish the value of the film or my enjoyment of it.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|this app is great. you can connect to your facebook account without problems. this only connects to the weekly tournament aspect of the game but if you want to play the levels you can just get the free angry birds app. you can even send gift to your facebook friends through this app. i was even able to send more than one to each friend. this is fun and addicting and i recommend getting it.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|Was a good Android Bible but they went too far with a recent update wanting access to your personal phone directory. There are less intrusive apps out there.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Wow!!! This game is really great!! Great job Gameloft! You know what I noticed...that EVERY SINGLE Gameloft game is the best!!!!!
6304711891|5.0|Excellent movie.Non stop action.Great casting,great acting,great story,and a solid transfer.Ed Harris is the best.Get the pop and popcorn,sit back and enjoy.....support your favorite artists.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Themovie was more exciting than I thought it would be.  I thought it would just be a love story without action.  Great movie!!
B005LAIGW8|4.0|Might not be as good as the 1st, but what sequels are,besides LOTR.Good all around movie with plenty of action.Its well acted,in color,and a great transfer to disc.Its not a comic book.....support your favorite artists.
B0041D843M|5.0|I think this should be required reading for every high school student. It is a wake-up call to everyone eating the typical American diet,  even those of us who strive to eat healthy and avoid processed and fast food. There is so much cancer all around me and I was searching for answers when I found this book.<br /><br />Cancer,  heart disease,  diabetes,  and obesity can all be prevented by following a whole foods plant based diet. Read this for your health. If you only read one book, read this one!

B001XULSG6|3.0|Not great, not terrible... Just a bit boring.  I expect more from a Star Trek movie. I thought I was watching a long TV episode.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|'nuf said.<br /><br />But since the review requires 18 more words, I'll say this:<br /><br />these films were formative experiences for me as a child, I saw them all in the theater, and owned a ridiculous amount of Star Wars toys throughout.  I learned about who I was in the process.<br /><br />I'd like to share this experience with my own children someday, and relive my youth with them.  I can't until you release these films as they were, Mr. Lucas.<br /><br />I wish you the best.<br /><br />You're our only hope.
B00009NHC5|5.0|There was a time when scary meant NOT seeing the blook fly everywhere.  You knew the bad guy was right there but you still jump when he grabs the poor girl.  THIS is one of those movies.  Well written, well acted, and well shot, don't watch it in the dark.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I've been following since the beginning and I have been loving it.  I can't wait for season three to come out.
B00000ILDE|5.0|great copy, no problems with the disk. This version is never being shown on TV. Enjoyed seeing it again and again.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is an addictive game. Should have been a longer adventure mode. I'm ready to give jewel legends 2 a try.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Hated to see this series end, but was satisfied with the story and ending. Sure will miss Sookie and all her pals/enemies.
0316017930|5.0|Great research.  This book's story tells you, it's not luck or talent, rather hard work and good timing to become great.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Ted is wonderful, these conferences are quick to watch and thought provoking. Once you are hooked the topics are endless.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I don't think I read many books on women's leadership. And I am glad to see a new generation of women who are striving to gain more power in leadership positions in this country and throughout of the world. It is truly inspiring. A great book worth reading.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It's was a very good book love the whole collection and Amazon makes getting books so simple thanks a lot amazon
B00AG297GK|1.0|Worst Cohen movie ever it's like he wasn't even trying at all. Really not that funny. Too bad it wasn't any better!
B0084IG7KC|1.0|I rented the DVD because I have the good fortune to own a small place in the mountains of western NC.  People said you need to see The Hunger Games.  Well, I did.  The movie did absolutely nothing for me.  A big nada.  However, I must make two admissions, number one, I'm pushing 60 and number two, I do not like \\"fantasy\\" movies.  If one wants to see western Carolina scenery (along with a decent movie) then watch The Last of the Mohicans.  I guess some woman writer wrote a trilogy on this Hunger Games nonsense and made a mint.  Only in America.  If there is anything left in your cranium you might want to read a little Thomas Wolfe (the one from Asheville) or Charles Frazier (lives in Asheville).  Don't wast 2.5 hrs on this movie.  Mindless.
B00B935SUY|4.0|Sound City is a great look at a monumental rock studio in Seattle.<br /><br />Dave Grohl does a wonderful job taking us through the history of the studio, its famous Neve sound board, and the artists who paraded through it. The last portion of the film is dedicated to Grohl's moving the soundboard from Sound City to his own studio and subsequent jamming with legendary artists. At its core the movie explores the sound of music and how in this digital age, computers and pro tools cannot recreate the magic that occurs when one is working in the studio.<br /><br />Appearances ranging from Barry Mannilow to Rick Springfield to Trent Reznor help enhance this doc.<br /><br />A must see for any fan of rock music and music engineering.
B0082A3HTQ|5.0|Excellent for easy listening and if you saw the movie, well you will appreciate the album that much more. enjoy and share!
1401922732|5.0|These cards are easy to understand and super easy to read. They are exactly what I needed. I love the cards.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|This kept my granddaughter ( 4 years old)entertained for quite some time. I would recomend this game. Give it a try
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is an awesome game. But it does have some glitches. It goes faster as you go along the game. Assuming that you can do it, or trying to make you loose. But overall a very fun adventure game.
B00CY9AA6E|5.0|This is rather simple app, but I love it. It does not require loging to any servers, it does not have any advertisements and it does not crash. It just gives you lot of tests to your memory and shows your results and progress. I recommend it to anyone who want to use couple minutes a day to self-improve.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|What a great app to have with a very intuitive interface. Great work by the dev. Love when a new creative app comes out.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is a fresh spin on a contemporary romance. The story is a narrative from the male point of view. It's not for the faint of heart, but it is raw, honest, hysterical and truly wonderful. Can't recommend it enough!!
B009GEFXLC|4.0|Enjoyed this season as much as the first 4 seasons....fun and interesting!! I would recommend to all who have watched previous seasons
B007KZY1YY|3.0|a bit boring, just the same things over and over. how many times can anastasia roll he eyes? it was a repetition of #1
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I dont drop my phone usually or do high risk activities where my phone may get damaged so I don't need a huge Otterbox type case that will protect it from the apocalypse.  I bought this case frankly because it was cheap and it was made by Amazon.  If you read my other reviews on Amazon products, you will know I am a fan; and this case falls into the &#34;impressed&#34; category.  I have occasionally dropped my phone or hit it hard against something, and this case provides the amount of protection I need in a slim, unassuming case.  I like that it came with a screen protector because even though I don't drop my phone often, I do tend to put it in the same pocket as my keys (which has scratched the case all up).<br /><br />Overall, if you dont need a lot of protection for your phone and need a slim case to take care of everyday hazards, then this case would work for you.  If you need something to protect it from habitual drops or dips in the pool, then this case will not provide the protection that your looking for.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Great classic and prequil to the rest of the series.  never was sure why they did not make this the first movie.
B0083ZRAJS|1.0|This wonderful classic is an easy read, however, I am disappointed to say that this is the one instance when I truly believe that the movie is better than the book.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|This movie fell down completely for me.<br />Arkin and Goodman were just caricatures, though intended to be satirical of Hollywood.<br />As far as \\"taut, suspenseful movie-making\\" goes there are many in this genre that are superior.<br />It never left Hitchcock behind.<br />And the unfortunate tendency of script writers in our era to use so many four letter words is a reflection of their inability to write intelligent dialogue.<br />If everyone tosses out profanity in every situation, men and women alike, from those in the White House to those down on the ground, that is just a way NOT to write a literate, involving script for me.<br />It's formulaic and hardly makes the characters seem grittier or more sympathetic.<br />Do all tough guys swear so much?<br />What if Bourne or Bond tossed off so many lines with the obligatory profanity?<br />At best this is just generic film-making I am afraid, displaying no originality and utilizes the cliches of other recent and popular films to underwhelming effect.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I really like this game. Lots of levels, repeat, back, hint. The game also tells you how many times you have won.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I enjoyed the maze runner and equally enjoyed book 2 it's a very fast paced read and I'm looking forward to reading book 3
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like being able to see what the weather is where I live as well as other locations. I can see what the weather is going to be in the future.
B000JQU4TW|4.0|Oscar Wilde is just too funny. I laughed out loud throughout the entire book. Dark comedy mostly but comedy all the same. An enjoyable read!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Great series!  Characters well developed and the story pulls you into their world. I ended up reading the entire series over three weeks and am hoping there will be a few more coming. Looking forward to the translation on the big screen this summer.  Definitely worth reading for adults as well as teens.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Best motivation book ever!<br /><br />Is changing my life.<br />I have the book, the video and the e book. Can I say more?
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Love how this book shows more of the reality of true love not the fairy tale ending at all,it's so real and true of what people really go through with love,lots of pain and sacrifice. I'd recommend this book to all my romance novel loving friends,they'd really enjoy this book.
B002XXNSF6|4.0|Nice slice of life movie, fairly good performances from young actors. Good cinematography at a beautiful city and interesting characters encountered.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Very creepy. I knew this movie would be good coming from del Torro. The scenes with stuff coming out of the wall were among my favorite.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Being a huge gamer, this was the best nod to all the classics and next gen games! Story was perfect, cast was amazing and MY GOODNESS! I had so many feels during the movie
0802473156|5.0|Not for the light of heart for it will require real WORK to turn your marriage around...but at least the outlook is GOOD.  I DO wonder if this technique, tho it appears relatively foolproof, has weaknesses.  I can't think of any...
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|slick design, user-friendly software interface, and it's pretty cool to find out that I can change the color of the LED logo, recommended!
0062231375|4.0|I am not a cook; in fact I cook poorly.  I am not a pretentious foodie, but I do like good food, from food trucks to five stars.  This book though has altered my perceptions of restaurants - I'm not sure I want to eat in one ever again!
B005HI4LLY|5.0|i did not want to watch this movie (i think because of the title) but got talked into it. it is one of my favorites now. i laughed so hard myl stomach hurt. its goofy but clever too. you have to see this movie!
1451695195|2.0|Since there are already more than 4,600 reviews it would seem hardly necessary to add another one. But since the vast majority of reviewers simply believe what Dr. Alexander wrote to be true in all its aspects and informed critical voices are relatively few, the public needs to be aware of some crucial medical facts.<br />It is correct that Dr. Alexander was for a week comatose as a result of E. coli meningoencephalitis. It is also correct that had the condition not responded to antibiotic treatment and had prophylactic artificial respiration been discontinued he would have died. It is not correct, however, to state as was repeatedly done in the book, that his brain had been \\"dead\\" and any time and that his book provides scientific proof for an afterlife.<br />His coma was not only due to the meningoencephalitis but also in part medically induced, and sustained, in order to prevent further epileptic seizures which had occurred as part of the illness. When anticonvulsant medication was reduced his level of consciousness had, as far as his wife's report is concerned, improved (p.106).<br />From a medical point of view I don't doubt that Dr. Alexander had a subjective experience of heaven at some time during his coma and most probably while it had started to change into sleep. NDEs are real phenomena about which I have written in the medical literature in 1980 and 1981 (reprints available on request) when they first came to public attention as a result of Dr. Moody's book, Life after Life. Then as now, it was claimed that these subjective experiences are proof of an afterlife, but this rests on belief rather than scientifically established fact. In my opinion NDEs fall into the group of subjective experiences which have been called Cosmic Consciousness in 1901 by Maurice Richard Bucke and discussed by William James in his Gifford Lectures (1901-1902) under the title: The Variety of Religious Experiences.<br />These experiences exist, but at present we don't know how tointerpret let alone measure them. Yet science requires measurement and this makes Dr. Alexander's statements unscientific in spite of his claim to the contrary. Furthermore, as a neurologist and electroencephalographer who is interested in the NDE phenomenon, I have previously asked Dr. Alexander to make his complete medical chart available to qualified physicians so that we can judge how \\"near death\\" he actually was. One or more EEG's were undoubtedly obtained and these would provide objective evidence in regard to the state of his brain at that time. Since EEGs are likewise \\"interpreted\\" the raw data, which nowadays exist in digital form, could be put on CDs and sent to past and/or current officers of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society who could render their opinions. The same applies to the MRI(s) where neuroradiologists would serve in that role. This is the normal scientific way to assess claims, especially ones that are so unusual and potentially important as Dr. Alexander's.<br />Since he has so far not seen fit to honor my requests I am now making them public. The scientific community does not merely consist of nay-saying \\"reductionist materialists\\" but it does insist on being shown objective data before a given claim can be accepted as scientifically valid. Up to now Dr. Alexander has provided only unsubstantiated and in part exaggerated claims. His book should,therefore, be regarded as an account of a subjectively real unusual experience, which has led him to recover his previously lost religious faith, rather than as scientifically valid proof  that consciousness can exist without a brain and for an afterlife.
B003INBOE2|5.0|Loved he movie. The clarity of  Blu-ray is amazing. The IP Man series if fun to watch. I wish there were more.
0374214913|5.0|This was recommended on a reddit list of \\"books like [[ASIN:0307887448 Ready Player One: A Novel]]\\" and I am extremely grateful for it.  I couldn't put it down, I didn't want to leave the world, and I look forward to a long career from Sloan.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|I love the list of singers. Blu-ray makes watching them sing a very pleasant experience, not to mention the choice of songs performed. Very happy with this purchase.
B00CRS5HII|4.0|However, if you're going to buy it, I would recommend you spend the extra 2 dollars and get the deluxe iTunes addition since it has a few cools songs that are not on this album issue
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I tried this game once and got hooked. its fun and challenging. Ive had this game for quite a while now and every time I think its getting to easy it gets harder which keeps it fun
B009NY43NY|3.0|The ending seemed forced.  I have been a huge fan of the Sookie books and this just didn't ring true to the spirit the books have had in the past.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Bought this for my (former-although there is really no such thing) Marine father. He loved it! Can't wait to see it myself.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A fluent story that keeps moving along. The characters are neighbors and family members of any culture or ethnicity. Love Hosseini and can't wait for his next book.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|I'll let the poets give this the justice it deserves. But I'll just call it indispensable.  The Stones, reaching the end of their peak, having recently released Some Girls, pay a visit to the Checkerboard Lounge in a act of reverence and gratitude. Too bad they didn't also bring the suitcase full of cash they owe Muddy. The performances here are amazing...... touching, funny, brilliant and just a perfect pure reminder of where this all came from and how it started. A shot of Muddy singing ' like a Rolling Stone ',during \\"Mannish Boy\\", with Mick next to him on stage is absolutely  mesmerizing. And the irony is not lost on Muddy. Jammed onto this tiny stage, this is as much about the characters as about the music and performances.<br />Muddy's like Don Corleone, with Mick almost a yippitty dog at his feet. Keef is looking whiter than the KKK  but playing amazing. and you can see what a gifted player Ronnie Wood is. They both look like teenagers having the time of their lives.  and who could blame them?  The cameos are priceless, from a Sam Cooke like Junior Wells to a drunken Lefty Dizz, who provides much of the humor. He's also quite an amazing guitarist.  Looking weak is Buddy Guy, who, looking like he just climbed down from a mountain of blow, can't seem to get in sync or even in groove with a couple of white guys. What's great and comical however, is the lack of deference paid to the Stones, they're welcomed but they're not considered the evening's stars. Love it love it love it. and the can of Old Style on the piano makes it perfect!<br />So much is owed to Mr. Muddy Waters, may he rest in peace, as he is sorely missed.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Great movie!  Very close to the book.  I have read all 16 Reacher books.  Good action without showing blood.  Well done!<br />Hope they do another.<br />Rick
1612930425|5.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was a very surprising novel for me. I expected some sort of stuffy difficult to decipher writing style, but instead I got a great novel. Of course the plot is not all that original, it is one we have heard time and time again of love/hate relationships. Truthfully, I think that this novel is a great opportunity to introduce young adults to the classics since is is not that difficult to comprehend and has a story line that is still relatable after all of these years. I found this novel both entertaining and enlightening as to life in a different time period, though Elizabeth's spunk will definitely catch the attention of many young women and be an inspiration to them. Overall, this novel is very cute and a great way to begin students' interest in the classics.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|A game changer on the inside,  I used this in combination with his other book,  The Tree of Knowledge and found them both to be of great help.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I'm only 10 and if you have a lot of imagination then this app might just be the app for you just think it then type it and it will come alive
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|This app is great for the kindle fire! It has all the themes, and well, they're awesome. It has ninja theme, Antarctica theme, and two Halloween themes. If you have a kindle fire, you won't be disappointed!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Plot draws you in.  Best dramatic series we have seen.  Seasons are short.  Look forward to more episodes coming soon.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It grabbed me early on and kept me spellbound throughout. I really became attached to all the characters. I finished it in 2 days.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|After reading the first two books by this Auther, I was eagerly awaiting this new one. \\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\"A Million Splendid Suns\\" were two of the best books I've ever read. So, I couldn't wait to read this book.<br /><br />I have to say, for me, it was very disapointing. I felt it was disjointed. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did.There were parts of the book, where it seemed he was telling a story inside a story, but it never led anywhere.<br /><br />I would still read other books by Khaled Hosseini, in the hopes that they would be as good as his first two.
B00129MIBW|5.0|I taped this off the broadcast years ago.  the scores are good, and some still go through my head and make me smile many years later.  It has some great twists that add both humor and charm, and gives depth to the characters that we don't generally see in productions of snow white.  considering it was a local production, the production values are pleasantly high - though there are moments some lighting is more stagelike.  highly recommend for all ages.
B00AG297GK|5.0|For what it was, it was hilarious! A complete satire on terrorism and dictatorships. I feel this is a very underated movie and Sacha Baron Cohen has once again proved his comedic genius. This is one for the ages and will go down in history, like Dr. Strangelove. As for all the bad ratings, what can you say, true greatness is often misunderstood by the masses. Artistic Genius!
B0027MJU00|2.0|Dark Places leaves you just there - in a dark place. Child molestation, animal sacrifices, devil worshiping, depression, murders, and on and on. Way too excessive with the dark themes. Pass on this one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This spider game<br /> is fun and the random deals are challenging enough to keep it interesting without too  much frustration. Great when you want to pass the time but don't want to get too involved.
B00CRMWMZ0|3.0|They're moving into middle age it seems. Kinda nice and they reflect back on R&B hits and makes some amusing referential music, but overall not up their prior work.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|The instructions are easy to understand as to which keys to play and when to play them; however, for me it is challenging to play the notes in a timely manner, even in slow timing.  Several good songs are included which you have the capability to listen to them first if you are not familiar with the song and then try to play the song.  The Piano Master is so much fun! I would definitely recommend this.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I've read all of Grisham's fiction and this one was a fun read.  Interesting characters, clever plot, only a little predictable. I recommend.
B0055S348W|5.0|It works very well. Finds my printers right away. I had a number of them that I turned on and I think it failed to recognize about 80% of them. The print a web page is nice. I guess the one fault I could find was it doesn't print everything that a desktop will print. If I need something printed it isn't quite as easy as a desktop to printer run. Overall though I waited a long time to purchase as I prefer free apps and this just beats all others.<br /><br />If you're looking for a printer app as said previously this is about the only one that covers all brands.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|This movie I had seen in 3d my first ever and it was the best, enjoyed the action and plot in it. I totally recommend for anyone who loves a good thriller.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter got me hooked on this game.  We play all the time.  I like that it has frequent updates, so while the general game is the same, the backgrounds change often so you think you're playing something new.  It's a fun game with many challenges.  They do well to keep it updated and fresh.  Hasn't gotten old yet and we play all the time.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Paramore always rocked the house with a DYI eff-you attitude that served them well. But here they've grown up a bit. Writing is much tighter, as are their respective chops as musicians. Finally a mature, wholly satisfying CD.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|My daughter loved this movie - buying from amazon, we had immediate access to watch online before it even shipped.  That was a nice feature.
B00005JA8B|4.0|No,  I never saw it before, hard to believe it has been around for a generation. It remains a fine action thriller, not at all what I expected, never having  heard of the film. From a routine, though good,  special unit combat movie, it turned into a fight against a Beast who never is identified, but is too high tech to have been of natural origins. To say that much, I imagine, doesn't reveal anything that is not in the public domain. This is one to be seen by all ages, save for those whose ears don't tolerate a handful of expressions to be heard in any woman's dorm in the country. I liked it and commend it highly to most who have a taste for tough guys  taking on jungle warfare of a different sort.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I don't like that the person in the game is getting chased by a monster, but other than that, the game is pretty harmless for children.  Easy to maneuver and figure out.  Not addicting for me or my child.
B0006A9FKA|2.0|I don't intend to knock the film; apparently, it is quite favorably received by those for whom it was intended. That wasn't me. My mistake. Should have looked more closely at the description and reviews before buying. I should think that if you are a person who enjoyed Bob Hope and  Paulette Goddard in their comedy featuring a zombie when it first came out, you will not really get much out of this film. In other words, it ought to bear one of those age warnings, the equivalent of a rating that says a 17 year old  must be accompanied by an adult, which advises that an adult over the age of ?? cannot view this film without being accompanied by a younger person (who can point out what is humorous and why).
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|I am a game player, this game is ok, but gets boring to me.  My daughter also enjoys playing it, but it's not her go-to game.  Not really addicting - easy
B007SGM084|5.0|Don't read this book at family functions or on family car rides....it will be ackward!<br />Dirty dirty good dirty<br />Wish it was longer....I want to read 50 shades of family life....
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Purchased because I always liked the beat at parties. Excellent long drive music. Get lucky is probably my favorite track on here.
0380973650|5.0|It's no wonder why hollywood producers have been trying for so long to seduce Gaiman for the rights to a film or a miniseries. It has lots of  potential for both of these projects because of the visual elements this story offers. The way we follow Shadow's story, in a pace so slow at times, but rich with deep feelings of solitude and wonder. It took me for a ride I wasn't expecting and that made the journey so exciting. A fabulous read. The cover art of the road with an ominous storm is very fitting and puts you in the right mood to embrace this tale. I have yet to read Anansi boys, Graveyard book and the Ocean at the End of the Lane. I'm really looking forward to them!!
B00766CLPI|2.0|Everybody thinks that Barbra Streisand has some sort of gargantuan ego.  I've never met her.  Have you?<br /><br />Her singing on this album is flawless.  But who the hell wants to hear this?<br /><br />In the first 10 or 15 years of her career, she made smart and wise moves and then those that guided and goaded her convinced everyone that she could sing classical.  Or sing in the French language.  Or Italian.  Or Yiddish.  Or, as of late, Portugese.<br /><br />The rumor/legend that she can sing \\"anything\\" is preposterous.<br /><br />Relying heavily on wonderful orchestral arrangements, Streisand really doesn't quite cut the mustard here.<br /><br />But you gotta give her credit for trying!
B00BU18U82|5.0|I have enjoyed many hours of fun with this app/game as I find it addicting. believe me the hours do fly by! have not really seen what the difference between beginner and expert is. Also would like to have bigger fields and animals, but for the size of the game and the price, its fantastic. great job!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Time killer fast challenging ..fast past they even have an option for a non power up bingo which I love nice game
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I would like to see a square root function for the calculator. I like the large key pad numbers and symbols.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game my only complaint is I don't know anyone that plays so I have now towns to explore.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I check it everyday - so it very nice to have this on my phone so I know how cold it will be here in Minnesota
B000V696ZI|5.0|An excellent Marley album.  Always Bob, always fantastic,  Had a few cuts I had not heard before.  I listen to at work all the time.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|I really looked forward to watching this movie.  A plodding plot line sank it.  I fell asleep midway, then fell asleep with 19 minutes to go the following night.  The next morning I accurately predicted the predictable outcome.  ZZZzzzzzzz....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|OMG this book was great!!!!!^_^ like I haven't really enjoyed a book this much since the twilight sagas and I think this book might even be better,but I'm not saying.

193700788X|1.0|This was such a disappointing end to the series that I wish I hadn't read it.  I should have listened to the advice that the ending was horrible and not to bother.  It does not seem that the story did right by the characters at all, that is the worst part!  It was a forced happy ending with the wrong character and leaves you feeling more letdown than anything else.  It's like a betrayal by the author.  I am going to erase it from my mind and picture my own ending so that the whole series wasn't such a waste by ending like that.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|This is excellent series. Our friends recommended it and we were hooked with the first episode of season one. Don't miss it!
1408215330|5.0|This dictionary is an excellent tool for foreigners. It is very easy to understand the definitions because they are written simply and clearly. This book is manufactured in India and it's great!<br />I give the highest recommendation for people to buy this book.

I bought this to add to our record collection knowing I liked at least three songs on it, and the others did not disappoint. They are very easy to listen or to rock out to, depending on your mood. My purchase was delivered quickly and I am very happy with my purchase.

B00CW665VI|5.0|5+ \\"Dark Side\\"  Kisses!<br /><br />Holy sweet amazing Jesus! I had a feeling I was going to love this book...and my feelings rarely disappoint me. Not to say that it doesn't happen but when a book is referenced to other books that I have loved as well...all signs point to a good thing. I am so freaking off the charts in love with this book and all it entails I can't even put it into words...but I'll try :-)<br /><br />Andrew Evans...do you see that picture on the cover of the book? That delicious piece of man candy that made me drool with just one glance. That my dears....is Drew motherfreaking Evans, in the flesh and in my imagination for all it's glory. And believe me...he was, is and always will be glorious. I cannot lie, the first couple of chapters I did not want to like Drew...but I couldn't stop it...so I gave in, why fight it? He's a complete douche - a play boy to the max. He knows his strengths and he uses them to his advantage. He's blunt to a fault. He's ballsy. He's successful. He's like the businessman alpha male of my dreams.<br /><br />`I am all about self-determination. Will. Control. I determine my path in life. I decide my failures and successes. Screw fate. Destiny can kiss my a$*. If I want something badly enough, I can have it. If I focus, sacrifice, there is nothing I can't do.'<br /><br />Katherine  'Everyone-Calls-Me-Kate'  Brooks...I envy her in the worst way possible...and the best way possible. If there is a God, Emma Chase will write Tangled from her POV, because I swear that would be aaaaaamazing. SO freaking amazing. I'll beg if I have to, I have no shame. She's beautiful...but that's not all. In the words of Drew `She's adventurous, unapologetically demanding, spontaneous, and confident. A lot like me. We're a perfect fit, in more ways than one.'  *sigh* you see....some of the many reasons why I want to be Kate. Lucky B*$@#.<br /><br />\\"Do you know how much I want this? Want you? God, Kate...I've f@$%^&g dreamed about this...begged for it. You make me...ah, I can't get...enough of you.\\"<br /><br />So...they meet at bar, where Drew meets most of his `conquest's' and like the awesome woman that Kate is, she blows him off...with a good reason. She's engaged...to Bill  'Why-Don't-You-Just-Die-Already'  Warren - has a nice ring to it, doesn't? I can't take credit for that, it's all Drew. What can I say, he has a way with words. Among other things. But Billy isn't the only source of contention between Drew and Kate...oh no, there is more. So much more.<br /><br />`All kidding aside, this is a new beginning for Kate and me. A fresh start. I'll be a perfect gentleman. Scout's honor.<br />Then again, I never was a Boy Scout.'<br /><br />I was laughing with this book...a lot. Like laughing out loud hilarious moments. But there were also witty moments, sarcastic moments, and just moments that I couldn't help the cheesy ass grin that was plastered all over my face. There were hot moments (actually...a lot of super hot moments ;-) ), sweet moments, even some swoony moments (and who would have expected that from Mr. Evans...not this girl!) and yes...even those dreaded `scream at your kindle' moments...more out of frustration than anything else, but seriously - I wanted to smack Drew around...but just a little.<br /><br />`I gaze at her eyes. The way she's looking at me...it's just like she did after our shower yesterday. Like she's giving me something - a gift. That's just for me. Only for me. And it's her. Because she trusts me, has faith in me, believes in me. And you know what?<br />I don't want Kate to ever look at me any other way.'<br /><br />God Bless Emma Chase for creating a man I wanna f@$%, punch and hug...all at the same time...repeatedly. I started reading Tangled and was like really? I'm supposed to like this dude? Yeah right! I was wrong...she did it. Dunno how, still trying to figure it out, but I'll be damned if Drew didn't crawl his way into my heart. I love him something fierce. He's one ofthose guys that you're convinced is a lost cause, which makes that moment when he's not like a million times better. I think what made him more real was even after he figured out he actually liked a girl, he didn't do a 180 and completely change. It was slow...gradual... believable. I appreciated that, it made Drew as a character seem more realistic in my head.<br /><br />`I'll never get tired of looking at her. Or kissing her. Pussy whipped, thy name is Drew. Yeah I know. It's okay. I don't mind. `Caue if this is the Dark Side? Sign me up. Seriously. Don't be surprised if I start skipping down the street singing, \\"Zip-a-Dee-f*$%&#g-Doo-Dah.\\" I'm that happy.'<br /><br />Kate...deserves a freaking medal. Like the golden vagina of resilience or something cause Lord have mercy, Drew would have worn me down with his antics after the first 4 hours. He's a swoontastic beast when he wants to be. But I get it...after what happened, she built walls - better to protect yourself than to regret it later...but still. SERIOUSLY....the man hired a three man band, sent a million flowers and had her name written in the sky. F-O-R-E-V-E-R...that's hardcore. *sigh* Like I said...a medal. I really didn't think he was going to break her down.<br /><br />`And if I strike out? At least I'll go down swinging. If I crash and burn and she grinds my ashes into the dirty with her heel? So be it. But I have to try. Because...<br />Well, because she's worth it.'<br /><br />So  Tangled  is told from Drew's POV...100%. No bouncing, we're in his head the entire time...and let me tell you, it's a lot of fun in Drew's head. Loads of fun. In fact, I'd like to build a summer home there. He's hilarious, sexy, smart with a dash of frustration - perfect combination if you ask me. Don't get me wrong, Drew had his douchey ways in the beginning, but it's not that anything he did or said isn't factual, it just sucks that because men have penis's they think...differently about things. Some of it I agreed with, some of it I didn't want to agree with...but had to...cause it's the truth! And not that I've never read books from a guy's POV before but this is probably the best one to date. It felt very real.<br /><br />`Jesus. The taste of her-my memory was unforgivably inadequate. I feel like a recovering crack addict who just fell off the wagon and never wants to climb back on.'<br /><br />Of course Drew and Kate got their HEA...which makes me a happy little camper...but I want more, as always, cause I hate letting go. But then I find out Tangled is part of a series...and that makes me SQUEE...just cause...I love series, I love Emma's writing...and I don't even care what the next book is about I want it now, now, NOW ! And yes...I did stomp my foot like a five year old when I typed that. Ms. Chase has an amazing way with words and characters...while this may be her first book I'm SO glad it's not her last...because that would be a travesty. If you have not read Tangled...please, for the love of all things that are holy and decent...drop what you are reading and read it now. It's worth it. You'll thank me. :-) And I will leave you with the best lines out of the entire book...truer words have never been spoken (and they were spoken to an almost four year old): \\"Vaginas beat penises every time. They're like kryptonite. Penises are defenseless against them.\\"  #Truththose guys that you're convinced is a lost cause, which makes that moment when he's not like a million times better.

B007U1FEJE|4.0|I was born in Hawthorne California in 1976, so perhaps it is only appropriate that I became a fan of Beach Boys music early in life. In the last decade, I have discovered the band's sadly overlooked 1967-1971 period that failed to generate any big radio hits but actually produced some of the band's best music, such as the obscure classic \\"Sunflower\\" from 1970.<br /><br />The last thing anyone expected to see in the musically dreadful year of 2012 was a new album and tour by the legendary Beach Boys line-up after 15 years of seperation. Carl Wilson's death in 1998 resulted in the break up of the band as the remaining members went their seperate ways. Mike Love bought the rights to the name shortly after Carl's passing and has toured under the name \\"Beach Boys\\" throughout the last decade, but without a Wilson brother anywhere in the line-up, we all know that group is nothing more than the \\"Mike Love Band\\". All of a sudden, California's finest rock n' roll band resurfaced with the release of this album a year ago and followed it up with a 50th anniversary tour.<br /><br />Despite the missed presence of founding members Dennis and Carl Wilson, That's why God made the radio just might be the strongest Beach Boys album since the underrated Sunflower. The legendary Brian Wilson has come up with a batch of rock solid new tunes that manage to capture the bright, sunny, carefree atmosphere of the band's classic hits, and the trademark vocal harmonies and sunny melodies from years ago are still intact after all these years. These are happy, feel-good songs for all ages that both new and long-time Beach Boys fans will find appealing. The band actually manages to sound the same as ever even without Carl Wilson's voice in the mix.<br /><br />The title track is a perfect modern day Beach Boys tune with all the elements of their classic sound. The serene, hauntingly beautiful ballad \\"Summer's Gone\\" is the highlight of the entire CD and surely the finest pop song released in 2012. You will have to look long and hard to find anything on the radio half as beautiful as this sublime piece of music that soothes the soul with the kind of melody and harmonies that is sorely missing in music today. After all the years of drug abuse, mental illness, and turmoil, Brian Wilson has survived and continues to write and record quality music like this little masterpiece that serves to remind everyone what REAL pop music should be in the 21st century.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the reunited Beach Boys line-up that resulted in this fine comeback album proved to be short-lived thanks to the one and only Michael Edward Love who somehow feels that HIS bogus version of the Beach Boys {with Bruce Johnston along for the ride} is more important than the real thing. Halfway through last year's 50th anniversary tour, Love announced he and Johnston would be leaving the group to resume touring with their own line-up WITHOUT Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, and original guitarist David Marks who rejoined the band for this album. Wilson and Jardine, understandably let down by this turn of events, are anxious to continue on with the REAL Beach Boys and produce a new album as soon as possible and give the fans what they really want.<br /><br />Mike and Bruce,<br /><br />Your contribution to the Beach Boys over the years is certainly appreciated by the band's many fans, but let's get real here. The Beach Boys are simply NOT the Beach Boys without the man who wrote their body of work and made the band possible...BRIAN \\"THE LEGEND\\" WILSON! True Beach Boys fans who remember the original band will never be fooled by the bogus \\"Love-Johnston Band\\". There is only ONE Beach Boys, and that band dies with Brian Wilson, not Mike Love. What could have been a great and lasting comeback by a legendary American band has been ruined by the ridiculous bull crap that is an injustice to real Beach Boys fans who want the REAL DEAL. If Mikey Boy and Brucie Boy refuse to get back on board with the REAL BAND, the two jokers need to pull their heads out of their butts and give their little Beach Boys tribute band another name! Sorry to bruise your egos boys, but if Carl and Dennis were still alive, nobody would think twice about Mike Love or Bruce Johnston. Enough said.<br /><br />Brian, Al, and David....keep on keeping on gentlemen!  As a fan of the REAL Beach Boys, I have no problem spending my money to watch you guys perform. Mike and Bruce, give it up boys!

1932735410|5.0|I took a PMP Prep Class that used the Andy Crow book. Since I didn't have a lot of PM experience, and barely qualified to sit for the PMP exam, I was worried that the class and Andy Crow book was not enough. I was right. I failed at my first attempt at the exam.<br /><br />I regrouped and decided to get Rita's book to get \\"into the weeds\\" of what being a PM is all about. I read PMP Exam Prep cover to cover, grinding through the exercises and doing the end of chapter tests. And then I went through the book a second time. The light started to come on. Once I got a grasp of how to answer the tricky \\"experience\\" questions, I felt like I was ready to take my 2nd shot at the exam...and I passed. Thanks Rita (R.I.P.).

0547564651|5.0|The title is what drew me to this book by Paul Tough, \\"How Children Succeed.\\" But the subtitle--\\"Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character\\"--is what made me buy it. Educators working with high poverty students have always known the achievement gap has more to do with poverty than any other determining factor. Tough has made a very compelling case that explains how some children in poverty succeed and why most fail. Tough brings together multiple research in the areas of endocrinology, neurology, physiology and psychology to link together pieces of a puzzle educators and policymakers have been grappling with for decades.<br />Stories from each area of study overlap and hold significant meaning for those of us struggling to break generational poverty and help low income students find long term success. Tough does a great job describing seemingly disparate studies to help explain how some children find success even when life has set them up for almost certain failure.<br /> One of the most compelling studies was one described by Tough as LG. The LG stands for Licking and Grooming, by mother rats of their babies. Amazingly enough, when baby rats (whose brain structures are eerily similar to ours) are NOT licked and groomed by their mothers, they end up much less able to deal with stressors and succumb to a variety of health related issues as they age. These results are astonishingly similar to long term studies of people who suffer incredibly stressors at an early age.<br /> The role of stress, especially when experienced during early, development years, is strikingly correlated to the number of physical maladies and diseases suffered as one ages. The impact of experiences is profound. This is the most important conclusion Tough makes. Are we finally willing to admit nurture might be more important in shaping us than nature?<br /> Tough's summary of the work of Carol Dweck is equally effective in explaining some of the problems with students from poverty succeeding. Dweck's work on fixed and growth mindsets (both of the students and the educators working with them) demonstrates the power of positive thinking, hope and the ability to persevere in the most extreme situations.<br /> The only criticisms I have of the book are that while the descriptions and summaries of the research are incredibly compelling, the research alone does not give us practical steps or guidance in helping to develop grit or character in all students, let alone those from extreme poverty.  Additionally, the amount of time Tough devoted to describing the teaching and learning of chess rules and strategies was distracting. The emphasis on chess and developing master status with a group of disadvantaged students seemed too simple and surely not a magic bullet (even when presented that way by Tough).<br /> Educators have always known the role of parents in student performance and character is crucial. It's nice to have some concrete evidence this is so. We are a long way from solving society's problems, the achievement gap, and college success for first generation students, Tough's collection of stories and research summaries are definitely pivotal in shaping how all of us can have the most impact.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I read this book in three sittings as I hated to put it down.  At first it seems straight forward; a woman goes missing and her frantic husband calls the police. After that there is a roller coaster ride when everyone reveals themselves to be entirely different from they had first seemed. There are a lot of themes in this book but that would give away the story line. Read it and I'd love to discuss it with other readers!
1878424319|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I am very in to finding my authentic self.  I truly believe I have come to know me for who I actually am and not what other person may perceive.  I respect their right to their opinion, but don't have to agree.  I live by  &#34;To thy own self be true.&#34;  I was recently terminated from a job as my boss wanted either a yes person or someone who would rebel so she could be in charge.  I believe when I am wrong, I am the first to admit it and If I am right, I will have documentation to back me up.  I bought four books as I had just finished reading this myself and wanted to pass this on to people who are very important to me and are growing themselves.  Thank You Don Miguel

B004SBQGHS|2.0|you would think with the paid version of an app it would be released faster than the free version but here the opposite holds true. worst of all the Play Store continually wants to update the paid version with the free version.
B00AEFYWDC|3.0|This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The Blu-ray version of Primal Fear provides a good level of clarity and detail throughout.  A few lower light shots are noticeably grainy, even gritty in places.  The colors are not particularly strong, but neither are they washed out--something in between.  The sound was a bit soft.  I had to crank up the volume a few notches on my system in order to hear the dialogue.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, this Blu-ray does provide a better picture.  But this is not the type of movie where it matters all that much.  There is little in the way of scenic vistas and virtually no special effects.  It is mostly talking heads.  So in my opinion it is not a significant enough upgrade to warrant buying it again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the entire series in a weekend. They are suspenseful and very entertaining.  The descriptive style of writing puts you right at the scene.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|A new take on an old classic, the actor selection was outstanding and the emphasis is more on the actual story. The gorgeous<br />musical score is secondary. I have seen the stage play at least 4 times, the story is more powerful when you see it on the large screen.

B000AMPZF8|5.0|This is my ranking of their best albums: First place is Origin of Symmetry, second place is Absolution (this may be tied for first place actually), third place is Showbiz, fourth being black holes, fifth the Resistance, and sixth the 2nd law. What can I say, they just don't hold the same appeal anymore. There are a couple of incredible songs on their latter albums, like exogenesis, knights of cydonia, and take a bow, but really could you top, new born, bliss and plug in baby for shear creativity?
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Great guitar, lyrics, harmony, all the talents of the entire band showcased in this one CD. If you can define Radiohead, you're missing the point of their work. If you GET the point of their work, you can't define them. And you can't keep your head away too long, can you? Huh, am I right? Just try this CD. I dare you.

B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Altucher nailed it.  Choose Yourself is a game-changer.  Since the 2008 crash, people now understand nothing is safe anymore.  Not your job, your pension, your investments.  Nothing.  Relationships are different.  Outlooks have changed.  People are still scared.<br /><br />But in this book, James teaches us that by choosing ourselves and focusing on our own happiness, there is no limit to what we can accomplish.  Don't focus on a job with no security, a degree that will saddle you with debt and limited opportunity, or a house with a white picket fence that you will struggle to maintain.  In this book, Altucher encourages us to find our passion, but more importantly explains how to cultivate it and reap a lifetime of benefits from it.  Everyone who wants the most out of a job, a relationship, or really the most out of LIFE, must read this book.

0307949508|3.0|I read The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo and really loved it but this one just didn't work.  I forced myself to keep at it because I remembered that the first novel was slow to start and really got better but this sequel never got me hooked.  To be honest, I still have the last chapter to read and I am going to have to force myself to do so.  I thought I would like finding out what happened to Lisbeth in her past to make her such a strange person but it just became a chore to find out!
B0027MJU00|4.0|This is a story of struggle and the dark moments that everyone fears. It is one of those books you just can't put down because you are anxiously awaiting to see how it all turns out .

B008HFWF3U|3.0|Compared to the rest of my Pat Metheney collection, this album is somewhat disappointing, mainly because of the material.<br />I do NOT question Pat's talent as a musician, by any means...<br />However, there are NO familiar selections on this album; the music is abstract in the extreme.<br />Be sure to listen to some samples before buying.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|I personally think recent MEGADETH albums like ENDGAME and UNITED ABOMINATION are some of the band's best.<br /><br />Yes, yes I know everybody always gets nostalgic about RUST IN PEACE and SYMPHONY OF DESTRUCTION.<br />Of course I like them too ...... But, unlike bands like Metallica which just seemed to fade away in the 90s  (after their Black album), Megadeth continued to offer very good<br />albums (with of course one or two low spots like RISK).<br /><br />But ENDGAME, UNITED ABOMINATION and even THIRTEEN are very good in my book.<br /><br />In fact, ENDGAME and UNITED ABOMINATION are among my favorites now that I am 50 myself and not as fond of the pure thrashy stuff I liked more in my youth.<br />I appreciate melodic content with my heaviness as I have gotten older.<br /><br />After 3 difficult listens, nothing is sticking in my head as extremely memorable.<br />I say DIFFICULT because the production is a wall of fizzy, buzzy compressed noise that makes it hard to hear what is really going on.<br />None of the usual top-notch Megadeth production and sound quality here.<br />How bad is it ?<br />My wife who also loves hard rock and metal walked in when I was listening to this new release and asked me what was wrong with the stereo.<br />\\"Mike, why does it sound so fuzzy and muddy ?\\"  she asked.<br /><br />I ordered the CD and downloaded the MP3s<br />I hope the CD is not hyper-compressed like the MP3 files.<br />So compressed it loses much of the power and is flattening to the point of being more thin and lifeless.<br /><br />UPDATE -<br /><br />I just received my CDs for this new release.<br />I hate to say it, but my comments above regarding sound quality are not limited to the MP3 files.<br /><br />Megadeth historically has good sounding production quality on their recordings.<br />Examples -

Such an amazing, funny and sexy read. I was really intrigued to read his thoughts and understand how a man actually thinks sometimes. It was Hilarious and the characters were great; and the ending was just want I needed. LOVED IT!!!
B005S9ELY4|4.0|Based on quite a bit of truth. Many movies have dealt with the topic; especially Nick Nolte's &#34;Mulholland Drive&#34;.  This adds some flsare and action to the original historical facts of how LA kept the mob from establishing a permanent foothold in LA.

1400049628|2.0|I'm not going to go into the details of the exceedingly unrealistic virus, or his version of a zombie (seriously, magic would have been a much better excuse).<br /><br />Just basic contradictions (one section, he says it's best to hunker down in an  inner city, a bad idea in Any survival situation) and the next he says avoid them at all costs (the correct answer...).  He encourages practice of a favored weapons system, then turns around and says it would be too hard...<br /><br />His weapons section is abysmal, as well as recommended supplies (His recommended amount of ammo is horrible).<br /><br />The reason I'm not giving this one is the common sense sections are right enough, for the most part (mobility, noise and light discipline).<br /><br />Not understanding basics like the essentials of foot care and proper boot selection (especially if there were ankle biters around) is a Huge no no.<br /><br />Just get the \\"regular\\" survival variety.  (I know this book was written to be somewhat humorous and explore the Zombie TEOTWAKI trope, but it fails miserably.)  The recorded attack section is ok, and it Is better then WWZ.  But not by much.  The apple obviously fell very far from this tree.

0770437400|1.0|This book is a love letter to Israel and Cuba (These being 2 of the only countries to survive unscathed).

B0002V7OI8|4.0|There is really nothing to the Disaster when it strikes as compared to even B and C movies these days; even a TV budget stretches to stock film that does a better job than this one does. On the other hand, hackneyed though it may be, stories of people reacting to the  expectation of death does make for a Good if not a Very Good film. Most of it will be acceptable entertainment for the average viewer. A few of the \\"stories\\" which move the film along, make no particular sense, such as the one that begins the film. how the anchor-lady got her job. One gets the impression that it made up a substantial portion of the original book or script, but got chopped to nothing at all interesting by the time they got the film down to its final length. Most of the actors are serviceable in what they have to do,  with Morgan Freeman making an A-1 President (and looking too old to run for the real office) and Robert Duvall giving the space ship crew, which hopes to divert the death dealing comet, some class. I did not know that the surviving member of a notable British acting family had put  in an appearance until watching the closing cast credits.  Guessing game: what character did she play. All in all, sufficiently entertaining to warrant being the core of an evening at the TV without, I repeat, being a true disaster film.
0062059963|5.0|Oh, how glad I am that I decided to read this series. The Elite has delivered such an amazing and gripping storyline. I wasn't too sure as to just what was going to happen and was so delighted by the outcome. Yet, the last few chapters totally caught me by such surprise, I couldn't stop reading until finished. Nervous and on edge as to what was to happen, and what was going down. This series is so addicting and compelling. Whether you are into princesses or strong willed people, this series will succumb you!<br /><br />  America holds onto her beliefs in the second book of this series. We see unexpected events occur that would've never thought possible. America's heart is broken, only to find out the true feelings of others around her. Not to mention, the feelings that others have for her. We see more girls sent away by Prince Maxon and Aspen holding onto America. Both men are there for her. It's her decision on what will happen and the events that go down might have heavy influence on her choices she makes.
B002WY65VU|2.0|This is the kind of film you know is going over great for the audience for whom it was made....but you also now know that wasn't you. In fact, I knew that within the first two minutes of the film when a zombie spewed up (nice way of putting it) a mess of undigested  whatever. After that, it was just a matter of sitting through it because it was going over big with a different age group with whom one was forced to associate at the time. So, just a word of warning: if you are over the age when you speak of a teen-age girl (or boy) as being \\"hot\\", stay away. ( On the other hand, the same is true, if you can identify the entertainer who called herself a \\"Red Hot Momma\\".)
0060012234|4.0|I was originally asked to review Brent's newest book in this series but he ended up sending me all of them! To me, that's a sweet deal. This book definitely discusses a topic that leaves people in uncomfortable situations and feeling unaccepted. Truth is, they are right. They aren't. And sometimes people are just plain mean.<br /><br />  We meet Russel who knows deep down inside that he is different from all the other guys in the locker room but he also knows that he has to hide this fact. He certainly doesn't want to raise a red flag and be the school's laughing stock and throw himself out there as a target for bullies. I can't blame him. People are cruel. Kids are cruel. Everyone can be cruel at one time or another.<br /><br />  When Russel is safe at home and in his room he is allowed the freedom to branch out online and be himself. But when he's chatting with someone claiming to go to the exact same school as him and who's also into the same things, he can't resist. I instantly felt like it was a trap to get him to expose his true identity but alas, I was wrong. What he found that evening on the gazebo shocked me as much as it did Russel. The truth of that night will bring so much more into Russel's life than he could have imagined.<br /><br />  When Russel finally gets up the courage to tell one of his best friends about his love life, he finds out even more surprises that were totally unexpected. So, with all of them coming together, they create a name that would throw everyone off their trails. The Geography Club is introduced.<br /><br />  Is it true that they can have a safe place to get together so they can all be open about their sexuality and just be themselves? Or is it too good to be true? Will they all be left exposed?
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|You whiners need to get over it. Companies are here to make the biggest profit they can. If this means those that do not have the money, can not buy the product, SO WHAT!<br /><br />Companies are not in the welfare business. Some ding a ling Liberals feel that companies should price products to be available to all the people and this is the goal. They call anything else corporate greed. DERRRRR! It is about profit.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|I was reading a review above-- or maybe below-- which spoke of this set of disks as if it were a 2-disk set. It is a 3 disk set, at a very good price. The first disk is the original record remastered (as I understand it), the second consists of live versions of the songs, and the the 3rd disk is a well thought-out sequence of the song composition and group ensemble playing that turned into this widely hailed classic.<br /><br />I like the addition of \\"Silver Springs\\" to the first disk (although I think it may have been added in previous additions). Unlike some of the irritating, out of place songs that were strewn through \\"Then Play On\\" in latter years, \\"Silver Springs\\" is there because it fitted from the beginning.<br /><br />I will do some more listening to Disk 2. I'm a great fan of Fleetwood Mac's previously released \\"Live\\" album. At first listen, it is easy to see this disk wasn't meant to replace that one! It presents a contrasting light to the studio tracks, helping to round out the story, if nothing else.<br /><br />Disk 3 is something new altogether. It presents the Mac's individual raw materials that coalesced into Rumours. It shines a light on the respect and generosity within the group which enabled the individual talents to give away to the group what they'd found on their own, trusting it would grow into something better, and, hoping too it might, well, keep them together.<br /><br />There is a lot on this CD that was a real revelation to me. Fleetwood Mac winds back the clock to before the hit record \\"Rumours\\" was born and lets us see the various strands of virtuosity that only the Mac themselves have known up to now were at the heart of the shimmering sound. The sequencing of the songs on disk 3 keeps the standalone brilliance of various early takes at arms length from each other, so to speak, leaving the listener to piece together a whole. Making them a part of the Chain kind of. The Fleetwood Mac fan is catapulted way back into the into the original stew of \\"Rumours,\\" into the simmering, sizzling soul in the songs before they became the commercialized froth & confection of the finished product that set off the fabled big bang on the charts, the stir on FM car stereos, the blast out of frat-house speakers, the tinny nearness of beach transistor radios and the magic spell of cozy smoke filled rooms.<br /><br />It is fascinating to see the genesis of the \\"The Chain\\" taking place right before our ears, as it morphs into a Fleetwood Mac group composition from its former life inside two songs-- \\"The Chain\\" by Stevie Nicks, and \\"Keep Me There\\" by Christine McVie.\\" I am glad this early version of \\"The Chain\\" is seeing the light of day. A very charming song, on which Nicks's voice haunts over straight-ahead non-fussy guitar chords, this \\"The Chain\\" stands is a flawless gem, in its own right. It opens up a curtain on a certain ordinariness & everyday longing that went hidden beneath the thundering final version on \\"Rumours.\\" Nonetheless, as good as it is, it hardly hints at the magnificence of the final version which, drawing on the bluesy rocking basics of \\"Keep Me There,\\" shoves the  pensive initial opening verses of the song down a crazed, near-epileptic guitar-wailing climax.<br /><br /> \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" on disk 3 is another knockout. Stripped down to the bass, piano, drums, and guitar (who needs more?) it moves along with aplomb. The guitar concept is cool (a lot cooler, one is tempted to say, than in the hit-album version), as is the piano, and there's a kind of light-hardheartedness to it (I picture Cassius Clay gloating over Sonny Liston lying supine & defeated on the canvas below him) which is an essential part of the song, I think, but which ended up being lost beneath a tide of witchiness and halloweenery by the final version. It's a fun take on the song.  Stevie Nicks's lead vocal, though, has not inhabited the lyrics yet. They're a little tentative and warbly. You can hear her working on nuances and phrasing equal to the richness of the story-book lyrics. There's a world of difference between the light-hearted, coquettish way she stresses the word \\"lovers\\" in the lyric \\"rulers make bad lovers,\\" and the matter-of-fact delivery of it in the final version. There are also some splendid, left-behind vocal ideas that shine here: a reproving whispered \\"ahh-ahh\\" that punctuates the lead guitar between verses and a haunted far-away coda somewhat in the Yoko Ono vein, to close the song out.<br /><br />Disk 3 is almost as surprisingly good as the original vinyl record. I know other examples of rock artists' demos and early takes that have come out over the years; but, none I've heard are as well thought out, integrated, & revelatory as is Rumours Expanded Edition x 3.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I needed a light read and this did the trick while not lacking depth of character development. I'd recommend it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I think we decided to start reading this about the same time that it absolutely exploded online as well. I was sold the second I read a recommendation that said this was going to be funny. I think we were desperately needing some funny, and I know I was and it couldn't have came at a more perfect time.<br /><br />1) Drew. I thought his douchebaggery was cute. He was funny. Eh, it is true that I would totally hate a guy like him in real life, you know the ones who think that because they are gorgeous and have a lot of money that they are God's gift to women. But since apparently I am a glutton for punishment, I can't seem to resist a book with a bad boy. Drew, is mostly a spoiled boy so I couldn't help but laugh even harder when he got knocked down a few notches by his sister and father. He had me at his nickname for his sister, his relationship with Matt and Steven, his denial that he could ever fall in love and thought love 'em and leave 'em was a completely normal behavior. The part's I absolutely adored though, well aside from his persistence in pursuing Kate, and his flu, were his interactions with his niece Mackenzie. This is where I knew that he wasn't quite the douchebag he pretended to be.<br /><br />2) Kate. While I wish that I could've known more about what she was thinking, the strictly Drew point of view was fun. Only being able to see what her reactions to things were like through his eyes and how he dealt with it was even more fun! Kate was strong, independent, driven to find her place in her new job, and surprisingly unavailable. I was ready for the cheating plotline, and while I hate it, I knew that I would be rooting for Drew to come out on top. (Yes, I feel horrible about it...) Just an FYI, she doesn't cheat per se. Okay, enough that I would totally cut my husband's balls off and choke him with them if he did the same to me, but Billy has been with her for 10 years, and kept her as his fiance for 7. If he really wanted to be married to her he should've done it at least 8 ago...or that is my justification.<br /><br />(YES, I am psychoanalyzing the lives of fictional characters daily at this point, so do not judge me!)<br /><br />3) The rest of the cast. I am going to gush a little bit more of my love for secondary characters. Mackenzie and her swear jar, that inflation has totally gotten a hold on, and her honesty that only a 4 year old can give you. Alexandra for being the best big sister. She keeps his feet planted firmly on the ground and never lets his ego get out of control, but mostly just loves and believes him for who he is anyways. She is married to one of his best friends, and I found that awesome. Drew's monologues about Steven going over to the dark side by marrying his sister were highly entertaining. Matthew and Dee were a lot fun together and complemented each other, but were amazing apart too. Matthew was a great support for Drew as another bestie, and Dee was that amazing BFF that we all dream about. She has the most reason to not be on Team Drew, so read ASAP to find out 1) why and 2) what she decides about it!<br /><br />My favorite line:<br />Drew: \\"I'll be a perfect gentleman. Scout's honor. Then again, I never was a Boy Scout.<br /><br />So. I loved this book. Read it and have some fun. I hope you will anyways. I enjoyed it because it was definitely a light in all of the dark that I've read lately.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game. Mystery. Hidden Objects. Mini games. Plus a hints if you need help. I think this game should be played by pre-teens to adults based on the storyline. I think it would be a little too much for children younger than pre-teens.
B00132D808|4.0|They have a couple deep songs on here with style of lyrics I fell in love with from the 1st album (whoever says they sold out on this album ... must've been their first band that changed or something).<br /><br />Yeah, this album is different, and some of the lyrics in the songs are pretty generic or only slightly better than mainstream.  They do have a couple great songs on here, and all of the beats are catchy.  It definitely didn't have the perfection the 1st album had, and in their 3rd album, it shows that they can make great music when they spend time on it.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|(No serious spoilers.)<br /><br />I've given Heart of Obsidian four stars rather than 5, simply because the ending leaves a few loose ends that I wish had been included (Alice waking up, Mercy's babies, Ming's ultimate death - a few other missing story-lines I'd have enjoyed reading)). Aside from those dangly bits, unless there is another war between the various species (taking us back to the beginning), this saga is pretty much done. Finis, over. All that's really left, is the cleanup. Another book in this series would jump an unnecessary shark.<br /><br />If you already read the first few chapters (available before this book came out), you already know that the main characters are Kaleb and Sahara. The other characters we've learned to know and care about have minor guest roles to help win the day.<br /><br />Overall, a very, very, good read. I didn't put it down from start to finish (took me about 4 hours). Lots of action, serious battles, a damsel in distress, a heroic hero, never-ending love... a new unbreakable bond.<br /><br />Thank you, Ms. Singh, it's been a fun ride.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Let me say I loved the book but I HATE that Sylvia Day took this triology and turned it into what she is now saying will be 5 books. I waited so long for book 3 I wanted my happy ending I wanted the books to be wrapped up. I know I will continue with the series because I have to know how she wraps it up BUT I will not be starting any new books or series by her. I hate that this will now be dragged out she could have wrapped it up and I would have given 5 stars and told everyone to read. Now I say if you haven't started it I wouldn't. I have seen on her facebook saying it was never said it was to be a triology but it most certainly was you can still look it up as the bared to you triology. She also hasn't addressed the issue on facebook like I hoped she would. I loved the writing but if I was not already hooked on the triology I would not start it and after this series is FINALLY completed it would take ALOT to make me pick up another book from her.
B004LP601S|5.0|If Pretty Odd! didn't scare you away from PATD, then you will enjoy this album.  It is more akin to their first, matured, but not out there.  Honestly, I enjoyed Pretty Odd! but it was definitely more upbeat and not as dark and deep as their first album.  This one is the same way.  Listen to Mona Lisa if you don't believe me.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love this movie; it's fully entertaining. The scene where Katniss volunteers makes me cry every time I see it!
B00846REIS|5.0|Read this book and the 2  that follow.  Luve Gideon and hope Cary pulls it together for Eva's sake.  Love
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Very scientific and highly descriptive content.  Somehow it still reads very easily and the story reminded me of tuning back into a favorite show on television every time I picked it up!  Great book overall and would definitely recommend it to any fellow tech/sci-fi fan!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun. My family love it.<br />It is very intelligent.<br />I play it all the time<br />It is cool
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have been a loyal fan of this series... I pre-ordered, and I usually will not pay more than $5 for an ebook.<br /><br />I have to say that after getting to the end of this book I am furious.  I feel so cheated.  I still think this one was better than the 2nd book in the series, but come on!!  Other authors are charging $2.99 and writing excellent quality work, and this seems like a phoned-in effort that I was charged $10 for?  COME ON!!!!!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked the book and found it to be rather chilling.  There were clues to the outcome early on but of course the reader wants to believe what the father believes.  Many of the readers will have known someone like Jacob and will find the &#34;truth&#34; disappointing and sad.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This kept my family busy for hours! Very hard but lots of fun! Great family time! Kids get so excited when mom and dad mess up!
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|And he does it again ! It's always a good show with &#34;BIG A&#34; ! From Conan to Sheriff... he still packs the house!

B0098VYCCE|2.0|With the title, I honestly expected &#34;The Huntsman&#34; to ya know... hunt? Sadly, that wasn't the case and instead, turned into a sappy, strange love story. Of course, the visual effects were the only plus side to this movie.
B005BDZN62|5.0|The color was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great sound!!!! great story line a classic. Its kinda like romeo and Juliet but amazing and way better
B0060MYM7O|4.0|I loved the 2nd Season of GoT. The only complaint I have about this product is the fact that ALL the extra/bonus material is on the Blu-Ray discs. The regular DVDs are 2-sided discs with just the episodes. I buy DVD/Blu-Ray combos all the time, and they've always had the same material on both. I was surprised when I bought this. So for those who don't have a blu-ray player, it is better to just buy the regular DVDs since the extra material is included.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|lets face facts. Jack Reacher is the best. this is a great story, keep you on your toes until the end.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This book was a very enjoyable read, awfully sad though.  I found it to be a bit odd being orated by a Grimm reaper persona though.
B006UV8DJS|1.0|Doesn't tell you, you have to use ur finger to highlight a color.  Always outside the lines, nothing looks like the pictures.
B0094TDAYG|5.0|I found this disc to be mesmerizing - with the Indian styled instrumentation and vocals, and particularly the percussion is very catching. That this is a European (German) individual who has been heavily influenced by the far eastern melodies and sound is what sets this apart from recordings by artists originating from the region itself.<br /><br />I really like this, and will explore other offerings from Karunesh.<br /><br />Update 6/8/13: I listened to this 3 times yesterday while working from my office at home. The more I hear it the more I like it! Really infectious rhythms, and also calming. Changing my review from 4 to 5 stars. I highly recommend this recording!
0307346617|5.0|I've noticed that there is a movie coming out soon. I can't help but think that it won't even begin to compare to the novel. Told from several different viewpoints, it covers a variety of cultural differences and possible reactions to a disaster such as a zombie epidemic.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. It helps work the mind in different levels. It makes you think when playing. It always brings you a challenge.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|A very pleasant movie about a TV station getting turned around as all those involved learn to work together as a group.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a very addicting game. It would be better if you did not have to spend for different maps. and with each car that you buy you dont get to start over you leave off for how far you have to go like  1200m and you buy a car or a new map and that is still how far you have to go.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing a heart warming story with ups and downs. If I ever met August I would hug him. Auggie! Auggie!
0307592731|1.0|I got this book for a book club and I wish I hadn't spent the money on it.  From the start, it seemed the writer was trying too hard to be meaningful and descriptive.  She does not have a compelling story to tell, unless you enjoy reading about someone who makes ridiculous mistakes over and over again.  I cannot believe a publisher paid her for this (and that the Oprah followers are making it a best-seller). If it wasn't for Oprah's \\"seal of approval\\" I doubt this would not have made it very far at all.  If you want to read a hiking book, read \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" by Bill Bryson.  If you want to read a memoir about overcoming life circumstances then read the brilliant book \\"The Glass Castle\\" by Jeanette Walls.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was very interesting and exciting.  There is a movie coming out in November that is based on this book.  I will be interested in seeing it.
B001ANSS5K|3.0|Spoiler Alert--I reveal a lot in this review.<br />I think that John Green had a great idea including paper towns in his book. It was really interesting to learn about paper towns and to visit one in the book. However, the description of Agloe was sparse. I couldn't really picture it, even though I really wanted to.<br />I really liked how poetry was woven into the story, playing an important role.<br />I also liked the fact that Margo left clues to direct Q, but her anger at being found was strange.<br />I enjoyed the writing a lot of the time, but Q spent too much time fruitlessly exploring the pseudovisions, which slowed down the book in the middle.  It played into Green's theme of thinking you know someone when you don't, and also encouraged the fear that she may have killed herself, but that part could have used more editing. It would have been more interesting to spend that time learning about Margot's paper towns, rather than Q's paper towns.<br />I have to point out that although Q did worry about getting arrested in the beginning, because it would jeopardize his college entrance, much of the book contained cavalier behavior that undermined the book's credibility.<br />Spray painting and vandalizing people's houses and cars without any repercussions--even when Q told the detective and the victims about it? Q got off too easily for sneaking in and removing a character's eyebrow while he slept in his own home. Where did all of the beer throughout the story come from? What attracted Lacey to Ben?<br />The detective that was on Margot's case was completely negligent. Q called him with new information and was concerned that she had killed herself and the detective told him that because she is over 18, there's nothing he could do, and then he really did nothing.<br />Emptying beer out of a moving car window, and then throwing bottles full of urine out of the car window too? All of the characters thought that was okay, and not dangerous like it is in real life?<br/>Q lifted his hands off the steering wheel when he thought the car was going to hit the cow. Why--so Ben could save the day?<br />Can they use a BP card to pay for a motel room? Would they really take Q's car and leave him in New York? Where is Margot getting money? How is she going to get a cell phone to call her sister every Tuesday?<br />These characters live without consequences, so I was frequently jolted out of the story during lapses of integrity in the book. Although I think in the end, I'm I supposed believe that Margot will successfully figure out her journey through careful planning, what I really think is that she has been lucky so far and is in for some more extreme traumatic experiences.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Hard enough to make it challenging but offers hints if you get stuck. Looking forward to the next game from this group.
B00BU8QOII|4.0|THE IMPOSSIBLE is not a film about the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.  Even though it's set during that horrific tragedy, it's really the story of one family's really bad Christmas vacation.  Maria Bennett (Naomi Watts) and her husband Henry (Ewan McGregor) are ex-pat Brits living in Japan when they decide to spend Christmas at a beachfront resort in Thailand.  The film begins with a few quick scenes of the family's arrival at the resort (the three boys are sniping and whining a bit, like all kids do, and Maria and Henry are worried about whether or not they set the alarm back home and whether or not Henry's is about to lose his job). Of course none of that matters when the tsunami hits.  Maria and her oldest son, Lucas, manage to find each other in the aftermath, but there's no sign of Henry or the younger boys.  Maria and Lucas struggle to survive, are helped by some really nice locals, and end up in a crazy-crowded rural hospital trying to deal with the onslaught of victims.  Eventually we find out what happened to Henry and the boys and everyone gets to go home.  It's a feel-good movie that's a little hard to watch as it's unfolding - but don't worry, it will all be okay in the end.<br /><br />Most of the criticism this movie has received has revolved around two issues - first, there's too little about what actually happened during and after the tsunami, and second, the director (Juan Antonio Bayona) decided to cast generic white actors to play a Spanish family.  As I said at the start of this review, THE IMPOSSIBLE is not a film about the tsunami.  Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. S&aacute;nchez aren't interested in giving us a wide-angle picture of what happened to Thailand or to the Thai people or to any of the other countries and people devastated by the tsunami.  They are interested in the Bennett family - or in Mar&iacute;a Bel&oacute;n's family, to be more accurate.  S&aacute;nchez's screenplay was based on Bel&oacute;n's story about how she and her husband (not McGregor's Henry, but Quique Alvarez) survived their Thai holiday in 2004.  And as a survival story, the film works.<br /><br />But what about that second complaint?  Does the film suffer because of Bayona's decision not to hire Spanish actors to play his suffering family?  Apparently Maria and Quique don't think so.  Mar&iacute;a Bel&oacute;n worked closely with both Bayona and writer S&aacute;nchez to make sure that what happens on screen really happened to her family.  And the film makes no attempt to hide the reality of who this family really was - their names and photographs appear at the end of the film, just before the closing credits.  While I do think it would have been interesting to see Spanish actors playing these characters, it in no way changes what is an inspirational and emotionally gripping story.<br /><br />Bottom line, THE IMPOSSIBLE is one of those survival films that will have you chewing your nails, weeping uncontrollably, and praying to God that nothing like this ever happens to you.  It's about survival in its most basic sense.  And if it all seems a bit \\"feel-good\\" in the end, then it's done its job.  In no way is this great movie; but it is a damn good one!(not McGregor's Henry, but Quique Alvarez) survived their Thai holiday in 2004.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was Amazing, I can't wait for the 4th and 5th!! I think i'ts really sad that people are rating this book so low, based on the fact they they didn't realize that there were 2 books left! I for one new this info, and there for enjoyed this book!!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game is awesome it allows the mind to work out puzzles and also GRIPS THE imagination. You will not be able to put it down until you finish it in order words it's addictive
0316223239|4.0|So often, we read a story like this from the perspective of te kidnapped child. This gives such an unusual, haunting look into the world of a kidnap victim. I had to read it in two days and really hated to say good-bye to these characters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So much better than all other games. This is the best game EVER!!!! It is so fun and additing (best game ever)
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|It's been so long since I felt compelled to write about a complete LP. I am sure this album will fall safely in I get it, or don't, territory. I will leave all the Gobbledygook to someone with more time or lack thereof... All I can say is, not since Exile On Main Street, Physical Graffiti, Or Dark Side Of The Moon, has an album struck a chord so true with me. Without a doubt, this will be on my mental, and physical playlist for the summer. I think you have to most definitely be in a mood, or the mood to dig this. I go to sleep with this song buzzing like a mad hornet in my mind. Cheers, FM. The Vampyre Of Time And Memory
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like that the game is more modern*. The game is like temple run but it is more fun. It keeps you interested throughout the whole game.  * compared to temple run
B0054SMID0|4.0|GREAT film and cast. Local attorney that has no office, yet works on the road from his Lincoln Town Car. Defends the not so wealthy and trustworthy type, but they all believe in him and know where to find him to get the job done. a good weekend flick to keep the mood simple and enjoyable with a little head spinning drama splashed in.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! it is perfect for any horse lover's out there. it is so lifelike and is just awesome!

B009NY43NY|5.0|I am however, very sad to say goodbye to Sookie...to know I will not have another new, anticipated book to wait for... Thank you Charlaine Harris for the privilege of living in your creative mind through your Sookie Stackhouse novels! As a young mother I was enthralled in the vampire tv series Dark Shadows back in the 1960's, and haven't encountered a vampire story again until I stumbled across my first Sookie Stackhouse novel, and I was hooked (not to mention I am now in my 60's)! This Series is now My Gold Standard for modern day Vampires!
B001QWEE4E|5.0|Director Lee tackles a controversial subject and at the same time releases a beautifully filmed movie. I especially liked the closing song by Willie Nelson.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This is a messed up book from the get go. It is however, refreshing to find an author who is not afraid to end a book with reality, and not feel good.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Relatively interesting and informative about some aspects of federal justice system but not as engaging as many of his other books. His book on elected stat.e supreme court justices was informative and chilling. Those on death penalty both fictional and actual were more informative and gripping .
B008602KQI|2.0|The entire idea behind this book is humanity at its worst. The movie is just a product of the same.
B008220D7S|5.0|My wife and I are 44 and have 3 kids.  We howled with uncontrollable laughter at many of the scenes in this hilarious take on this uneven and trying time in our lives.  I agree with the reviews that say it was too long.  They could have easily shaved off 30 minutes and produced a more compact and less meandering movie.  Nonetheless we haven't laughed this hard since Bruce Almighty split our sides.  There was one bedroom scene that had me laughing (and crying) so hard that my 7 year old rushed into the room to see if I was OK...he asked \\"what is wrong with Dad?\\".  I would guess that many of the poor reviews are from the youngsters who have yet to experience kids and the other side of 40 when life takes on a completely different feel and this movie does a good job at poking fun at mid-life and all its ups and downs.  This is a Blu-ray buy for sure.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I read the books when I was little, and watched The Lord of The Rings when they came out. This was by the book, and well done. I love it.
0425263924|4.0|I enjoyed this third Crossfire Novel. Picking up right as Reflected in you ends it takes us a few more weeks into Gideon and Eva's relationship. This Nathan issue is still causing some issues with Gideon and Eva's relationship. We also get to see its effects of Gideon. Gideon is working on some of his issues and maybe developing some new ones. This book has everything you would expect and leaves some questions hanging at the end that will keep you waiting for the next book. Gideon and Eva are still working on their own personal demons and we get some more bits and pieces of Gideon's past. The drama in this book isn't just around the two of them but branches out to other people in Eva's life including her parents. I'm looking forward to the next two books. This was originally supposed to be a trilogy but for me it doesn't seem like it was dragged out just because. Each book only covers a small amount of time so I'm glad Day didn't rush the story or end it abruptly to try and fit it into three books. That being said their relationship moving as quickly as it does and the extra books will probably annoy some readers but I  will be happy to read about Gideon in two more books.

B00BEXB18M|1.0|Super Collider is like that lingering smell left in the bathroom after a serious bout of food poisoning from eating bad Mexican food in Tijuana. Once you've listened to this monstrosity, you'll instantly be sick. I'm a loss for words because I've been a fan for 27 years and it really pains me to bash Dave and company's latest release, but I'm left no choice.  The entire album is a poorly conceived mid-tempo hard rock album with tracks that sound like they could have been lifted from a Bon Jovi album. For starters, just listen to the title track and you'll quickly understand what I'm talking about. The slide guitar work and southern rock feel of The Black Crow is a disaster and feels out of place, the lyrics throughout the album are juvenile and preachy, the album has Dave Draiman, and although I hate Disturbed, Draiman does have a decent voice which so happens to be buried deep in the mix.<br /><br />I could write a dissertation on why this album is the worst in Megadeth's discography, but I'm really don't have the energy nor the desire to write the lengthy review truly required of me to do so.  Being a fan for 27 years, it's left me a bit numb bashing Mustaine's work because I'm a huge fan.  I understand that any band that has been around for 30 years will have a few stinkers in their discography. Risk wasn't very good, The World Needs a Hero was anemic, and Thirteen was a bit of a let down since it followed the solid Endgame.  But this takes the cake.  The songwriting is atrocious, and to be honest, maybe it's about time for Dave to allow the other members to have a bit more creative input.<br /><br />It's a bad sign when the best track on the album is a Thin Lizzy cover song, which so happens to be quite good and the only track having any redeeming value.  Dave is better than this. He is one of the greatest songwriters in the history of metal, but no one is infallible, and that includes him.  I just hope when it comes time to write for their next album that he rights the ship and writes killer material that we all know he's capable of.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a great game, nice graphics, for the people on the game, pretty colors, my son loves the game.
0425263924|1.0|This book should have been the end to this trilogy.  Instead, the author leaves her readers hanging and fills this book with unnecessary angst (Brett) to manufacture conflict to stretch a trilogy into a five book series.  Very disappointed with the writing and plot of this book.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is an inspirational book, written with simplicity that evoked strong emotions. She is indeed an amazing survivor!Highly recommend this read.

B00821PCJS|5.0|This is a highly entertaining and well-written program that portrays love of family as one of the best traits of the main character.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Think of the worst movie you've ever going to see. It must be better then this was. It was boring
B000MNP2K8|5.0|What a great new take on the Bond story. Craig is spectacular and the film's darker approach to the story is refreshing. It's tempting to lump this in with the other origins stories that stole the box office in recent years but it's something more.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was recommended this nook by a friend and from now on i think i'll read every book he recommends to me.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Although awkward in moments, this is clearly the strongest of the two halves of this movie. If only Tarantino would hire an editor who could stand up to him in his more self indulgent moments this could have achieved timeless greatness.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I will miss Sookie. I thought that MS. Harris did an excellent job of tying up this series. I will always want more books about Sookie but I was very pleased with this novel and thought it was well written and the ending was perfect from the entire series.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never quite saw the appeal for Buffy, but the complex themes and fully-realized characters of this series make it a real gem.

B00005JMUA|4.0|While not as strong as the first half, this bit of storytelling is an interesting blend of brilliant and clumsy.
B007SGM084|5.0|Friends of mine told me that I should read this book.  The more I looked into the reviews the more this novel appealed to me.  It's definitely a dark &very raunchy  read but in the end its a love stricken romance. Once I started reading...I couldn't put it down!

B00CW665VI|5.0|In Tangled by Emma Chase, Drew Evans has been adored his whole life: by his family, friends, clients, co-workers. And women. Especially women. He's never had more than just a casual encounter with the fairer sex and doesn't feel the need to ever have a long lasting relationship. So when he sees a lovely brunette in a hot NYC bar, he makes his move. Only she politely declines his advances. Drew makes pleasant conversation and Tshe seems interested when he says what investment banking firm he works for but she makes it clear she's taken. He moves on to other pursuits that night, although oddly enough, Kate keeps popping into his thoughts. Imagine his surprise when Kate Brooks is introduced as the newest employee at work on Monday and that his father (who owns the firm) wants Drew to mentor her. It is both his fantasy and nightmare come true. He would give anything to spend some \\"quality\\" time with her but he has a strict policy about not sleeping with co-workers. And so the dilemma begins.<br /><br />  \\"...I realize this attraction--no, that's not a strong enough word--this need that I have for Kate Brooks isn't just going to go away. I can try and fight it, but I'm only a man, for God's sake. Left unresolved, my desire for her could turn my office, the place I love, into a torture chamber of sexual frustration.\\"<br /><br />Drew lives and breathes his job and has a solid reputation as the go to person in his industry. He's intrigued to see how well Kate will do in the firm until they are pitted against each other on a very important project. They both want to land the account, so when the gloves come off and the pranks fly, the tension builds between them until they break down and have a lust filled make out session in his office. That's when things start to shift in their relationship. Drew becomes obsessed with her, but not just to get her into bed. Although that is a huge goal. But he also wants her to be successful and happy. He's not sure what's happening to him until it's too late. He actually has feelings for this woman. Deep, could-last-forever kind of feelings and it honestly scares him a bit. He takes a chance by showing her these feelings when the opportunity presents itself, but as is typical, he puts his foot in his mouth and pushes her away. Can he figure out a way to gain back her trust and give Kate everything she deserves in life?<br /><br />  \\"Apparently I've grown a conscience. I don't know when it happened, I don't know how it happened, but I am not happy about it.\\"<br /><br />Emma Chase puts a fresh spin on contemporary romance in this story. It is a narrative from the male point of view and she wrote Drew as if he was talking directly to you, the reader, including asking questions and engaging you to be a part of the story. This book is definitely not for the faint of heart, as it may be considered raunchy and explicit by some, but I loved every second of it! Drew calls them like he sees them and is unabashedly all male. So to see him in the process of falling in love is equal parts hysterical and truly wonderful. Even though he is a bit of a playboy (okay...a huge playboy) you can't help but fall in love with him and his raw honesty. If this is Emma's debut novel, I can't wait to see what she offers us next. Seriously...I can't recommend it enough!!until it's too late. He actually has feelings for this woman. Deep, could-last-forever kind of feelings and it honestly scares him a bit.

Drew calls them like he sees them and is unabashedly all male. So to see him in the process of falling in love is equal parts hysterical and truly wonderful. Even though he is a bit of a playboy (okay...a huge playboy) you can't help but fall in love with him and his raw honesty. If this is Emma's debut novel, I can't wait to see what she offers us next. Seriously...I can't recommend it enough!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was a quick read but that didn't detract from the quality. It was enjoyable and even offered up some nice laughs. I enjoyed it!
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|I have always been a fan of K.H. This book was very disappointing to me in so many levels. To being with, midway through the book, I was getting frustrated because I felt that the shift from one character to the next was happening to quickly and sans connection. There was no in depth character development. After a while, the whole thing just become predictable. I wanted to know more about who I assumed to be the main characters, Pari and her brother. But the author kept on telling us the reasons behind why each of the other characters were doing what they were doing. For instance, it was not necessary to know the life history of the Greek doctor. I can go on and on. At the end, I did not feel any real connection to any character and predict that I'll forget the whole book in a few months.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me wondering what would happen next.  It is fun to have a book that is hard to put down.
B00CTEP7O4|4.0|You fall in love with the characters, and hate for each episode to end. It's no Boston Legal but it's a great show centered around lawyers and their lives.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|Loved the game.  3 of us play it on my kindle.  my grand kids play it whenever I see them
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is way better than the movie. I know it is time to get the other books LOL can't wait!!!!!
B0012CJQY6|5.0|DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />You have been warned, my review contains at least one spoiler!!<br /><br />Good writing, good character development (Officers Vic Mackey, Shane Vendrell, and Julien Lowe immediatley come to mind), and good plot.<br /><br />My only criticisms would be a somewhat week Pilot with a somewhat predictable ending, but after watching the first episode with the commentary (something I recommend for you to do after watching every episode once) it was explained that the show's creator and main writer Shawn Ryan had never worked on a pilot before in his life.  Taking that fact into account gave me a whole new sense of understanding.<br /><br />Shane Vendrell might be my favorite character on the show (played by the excellent Walton Goggins, who's now playing Boyd Crowder [another excellent character on another excellent FX show])<br /><br />At times I had to suspend my disbelief (like when Vic and Gilroy place the dead body of a gang member in rival gang territory to make it look like a gang hit, but any forensics team worth their salt would know that the victim died in one location and was moved to another), but these moments were few and far between.<br /><br />I'd say this show is only second to The Wire, a least as far as police crime dramas go, and \\"The Shield\\" is definitely an equal to \\"Breaking Bad\\" (with perhaps Breaking Bad Ahead by a hair) in terms of basic cable drama.<br /><br />As my title states, this first season was so excellent in that it's made me want to see this series through to its end, and I think that should be every drama's main goal.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|So Glad we bought this movie, the digital download was such a great idea! The fact that we got to buy it and watch it before it was released on Blu Ray was just a bonus.  We can watch it on our TV's just stream it from our Amazon Player, or on our IPad when we are out and about with our little one. You can stream it from online or you can download it. That helps when your out at a restaurant and you don't have wifi. Will definitely be buying more Digital downloads from Amazon!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|major disappointment. deception. not as promised. no ending. save your money. would like to return. other reviewers correct. commercialism at it's worst. greedy.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I hated this book. It had so much unnecessary drama. I should have never even bought it. I loved the first two and couldn't put them down. This one was not the cases. I didn't even get half way through and I was done and ventured off to read something else.  Eva is coming off as a shallow individual and Gideon deserves way better then her. I should have saved the money in my book budget and bought a book I would actually enjoy. Don't waste your time and money. There are plenty of cheaper books out there that actually are worth the read.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|As a movie, stand alone and unbiased from the book, it was good. Not great, not bad, just enjoyable. The accents and the mannerisms were either spot on, or a mockery of the South. The scenery, filming, and set styles were gorgeous and beautifully made. The characters, while based upon the books, were loosely adapted from those characters and allowed minimal depth. Though I must say that the young man who played the lead character Ethan Wate did an excellent job. While I enjoyed the movie as it is, the screenwriters severely limited any potential franchise possibility by condensing, cropping, and bastardizing a series of books into one film. If they had allowed Beautiful Creatures the Movie, to be based sorely upon the first novel of the series by the same name, we would have serious contention for the recently vacated Harry Potter/Twilight YA throne. Any possibilities for further movies based upon the series was stopped before this movie was ever released. As an adaptation of a book onto the big screen, I have to give this film a dismal 1 star. The only thing they got right was names, places, and basic single plot (even that they severely messed up, especially the ending and the Claiming scene.) Now, no bitter resentments because I \\"didn't treat the movie fairly\\". I am sorry, but it was a film adaptation of A BOOK, and the only reason to do that is because the books have a large enough following to warrant the expense of a film. If you don't treat the source material with respect, then how then do you expect any kind of positive feedback from that same fan base for the movie? If the books had never existed, and this truly was a standalone film, I would have considered it a nicely done film, pleasant with a loose plot and a seductive cinematography to it. But that's it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Interesting twist but excited to read the 3rd book. Not as good as the 1st but this author has a great imagination.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I was looking for a way to enable my new laptop to connect to a network that didn't have wireless. I have a Dell XPS 13, a clone of the MacBook Air, it does not come with an ethernet port, but it does come with 2 USB 3.0 ports. Well this works perfectly. It registers on the switch as being a Gigabit connection and does everything I ask of it.

B007G92QGO|4.0|This is a thought provoking book, how would you react, how many people are in the same position with unusual children
B008OOYALE|4.0|Love the game!  1. It's fun! And it's flexible, I can obsess and spend all day or take just a few minutes with it; I can work with a large number of interactive neighbors or just a dedicated few while I visit others, both newbies to the game or experienced folks who are generous with advice and enthusiasm; it is easy to add or edit neighbors; I can accumulate gold from neighbors or buy if I want; there is someone playing 24/7.  Issues causing grumbling include: playing on different devices gives the player different tools thus dragons and I don't have some things I want want and feel limited and excluded at times; players have to deliciously selective in sharing some very limited resources ie gold. I hope the creators will continue to evolve the game while I find enough to maintain enthusiasm and play on!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I couldn't believe how much they wanted for these damn batteries at Target.  I got five for half the price of one by buying them here.  With all the little toys we have, it's nice to have a stock.  They shipped free in a regular envelope (no stupid unnecessary bubble wrap), and were here in just a few days.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I'm a big Lehane fan, have read all the detective novels. This one is different, more of a psychological thriller. I prefer the best detective novels to this one, but it's mainly a matter of taste in genre.  That said, I thought the novel was really, really well done.  Thrills with surprises, and Lehane's always-tight dialogue and expert character development.  I read the book having not seen the movie.  Still haven't, so can't compare.  Kindle edition had relatively few problems.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I can't help it.  This song is freaking catchy!  It got overplayed on the radio.  But now that the bell curve has passed, I'm glad I got the song for my player.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|In my opinion, this was the best Nesbo I've read (have read all those available on Kindle).  Action-packed, tight plotting, good character development.  I strongly recommend it.
B000002KON|5.0|In the late 1960's, The Kinks released two commercially unsuccessful albums, The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society and Arthur (Or The Decline & Fall Of The British Empire) and both of them seemed to fall off the radar until Village Green found the spotlight during the Britpop period of the mid 90s. While it was (quite rightly) hailed as lost classic, Arthur remained criminally overlooked.<br /><br />Based on the concept of a British working class family struggling with or accepting their day-to-day existence and dreaming of emigrating to find a new beginning, it features some of R.D. Davies' best writing and represents one of the first attempts to deliver class-consciousness in a pop-album format. From the \\"know your place\\" mentality of the rocking Victoria and the poignant She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina to the complacency of Shangri-La, to the escapism of Drivin' (on one level) or Australia (on another), to the cynicism of Yes Sir No Sir, to the polemic of Brainwashed, this is a remarkable document - a brilliant, honest, musical summation of British attitudes to class.<br /><br />Ray will always be Britain's finest lyricist, and he re-states his crown on this album, with this heartbreakingly simple line from Some Mother's Son:<br /><br />Some mothers son lies in a field<br />Back home they put his picture in a frame<br />But all dead soldiers look the same<br /><br />Wonderful
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This takes way too long to update still waiting for the Florida update. It is still a very good game
B000GCFG7E|5.0|This is one of Lee Child's better reads. Plenty of suspense mixed with just the right amount of action.  This is one that you want to read every word.  I'm a bit of an action junkie and I judge an action thriller by how much I scan the pages, bypassing mundane descriptions of things I'm not interested in. It is always a fine line between enough descriptions so you can clearly imagine the scene and too much so that the story looses momentum.  Child knows the perfect balance.
B009NY43NY|4.0|A little convoluted, plot-wise, but a good ending nonetheless. The last few books were more like chapters, so it was good to go out on a better note.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It cost 3 bucks to play the full version but well worth it. My kids loved it to. Very interesting.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|First Sylvia Day rips off the story line now she rips offer her readers.<br /><br />Not withstanding the distracting similarities to FSOG I read books 1 & 2 of the Crossfire series and was awaiting book 3.  Between the extended release, the reviews and learning that there are another 2 books I am left wanting just not wanting any more Sylvia Day.<br /><br />The book is nothing more than \\"fluff & filler\\" with no advancement in the storyline.  The plot lines advanced were set ups for books 4&5. The sex without a plot becomes boring and exhausting. Add no HEA and 2 more books=really pissed  off fans.<br /><br />I read most of the ratings and saw little if anything that was substantive or meaningful to justify the high ratings IMHO.  I remain unwavering in my original assessment.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game it has like the most awesome ponies in the whole world like celestia and Luna. and its differant from the show it self so I love this game!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My 8 year olds granddaughter turned her Father and I on to the game. Lots of fun with her thanks for the bonding time.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This addictive game is very similar to Around the World in 80 days.  There is a significant difference in that you can save your lightning bolts, hour glasses, bombs and there is even a swap factor to use later.  It is best to save all these to use them in the latter stages of the game as it becomes increasingly more difficult.  The graphics are stunning.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Terrific book, especially if someone in your family is 'on the spectrum'.  Books like this help to educate the broader community about the challenges of living with aspergers.  Do read it!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|very fun.  it seems harmless enough, but you do kill the driver when you crash.  I would let my 7 year old play this game.
B00127RAJY|5.0|jillian's dvd's are all a good workout. i have heard great things about this one in particular but have found that it's the easiest for me among the 5 biggest loser dvd's i've tried. maybe it's cuz i've only done level 1 but that's the level i've used on the other dvd's. i could always go up in weight on this one. i prefer the Last Chance Workout because it was so many different exercise routines and is set up for you to use everyday, Mon-Sat (Sun off), with 3 levels that should last a person 2 wk each.
B005544V6A|5.0|I like this series and will be watching season 2. Some of the things are predictable but still enjoyable to watch.
B0094MFITS|5.0|This was a short lived series but it was very good. I have enjoyed Tom Selleck movies going back to his days as Megum PI and Stone Cold series was not a disappointment.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I have been a Leonard Cohen fan for many years and pretty much like anything he does. This Cd is no exception
B009NY43NY|1.0|This end to the Sookie Stackhouse saga was a major disappointment.  It did not hold together with any kind of logic.  Sam?  Really?  We are supposed to accept the man who has been a good friend, but nothing more, in the previous books as her HEA?  It doesn't work.  Eric could have worked (and would have been my preference) or Bill could have worked.  I could have written a better ending and certainly would have been happier with my imagined endings.  I wish I did not know how Ms. Harris cobbled together her ending to the series.  Given that I do know, it would be beneficial to maintaining readership for future works if Ms. Harris would either write an alternative ending book or write another Sookie book in which Sookie ends up with Eric (or Bill).  It shouldn't be too difficult for her to devise a way for Sookie to become \\"immortal\\" for one of them without actually becoming a vampire.<br /><br />Yes, they are Harris' characters to do with as she pleases.  It is also my money to do with as I please, and I please to  avoid buying any of her future works.  I don't appreciate an author who cannot tell when burn out has been reached in a series and who keeps writing well beyond that time.  Apparently that is just what happened with Sookie Stackhouse.<br /><br />It is notable that Stephenie Meyer was able to provide an ending that did not totally alienate the \\"Team Jacob\\" fans of her books.  Too bad Ms. Harris was not equally thoughtful in writing her last Sookie book.<br /><br />If you enjoy reading about the supernatural, try some of the other successful authors who have been able to write series that do not leave their readers feeling like they have been sucker punched - Lynsay Sands, Sylvia Day, Kerrelyn Sparks and Deborah Harkness, to name a few. All have books available through Amazon and all write endings that leave the reader feeling good.
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|Story line could have been awesome but it didnt flow and very hard to follow. We should have read the other reviews before renting.
0451232577|4.0|Ken Follett did his research for Fall of Giants, and it shows. The novel opens with a detailed and convincing depiction of life in a Welsh mining town on the eve of World War I. Later, Follett does a marvelous job setting up the Battle of the Somme and follows up by describing its awful results -- Telegram Wednesday, when so many families learned their sons had fallen for so little reason. He shows us what life was like for Russian peasants before the Revolution -- and after.<br />Fall of Giants is a good read. But it is not a great book. Some of the characters are paper thin -- too good to be believed -- or too easily bent to fit the purposes of the plot. One character, for instance, is an upper-crust twit until it briefly serves the story to give him enough clear-sightedness to recognize that the British military brass is making a calamitous mistake and enough bravery and rebelliousness to work clandestinely to undo the damage; once the plot twist is over, he's back to being a twit again. Similarly, another character goes from damsel-in-distress to drunken slattern and back again. Not that such transformations don't occur in real life. But here they don't feel earned. They feel more like storytelling artifice.<br /> Perhaps inevitably for a story so sweeping, the book is also filled with clumsy attempts to work history lessons into the plot -- often through lectures stiffly delivered as dialogue. And the toggling from the big picture to the lives of the characters often produces awkward passages such as a passionate love letter that ends: \\"P.S. Germany invaded Belgium an hour ago.''<br />But I enjoyed Fall of Giants, appreciated the work that went into getting the details right and felt (as Follett no doubt intended) fresh outrage at the injustices of the past. The novel's final scene is magnificent, too -- showing in human terms how the rigid social relationships of the past have been upended by a decade of war and revolution. So quibbles aside, I plan to read the rest of this trilogy.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|It doesn't matter if its 3 books or five when you don't have a plot. Just repetitive nonsense. It's book 3 you can stop describing how everyone looks we get it Megumi is Asian!!!!!<br /><br />And wtf is up with Eva being slutty!!<br /><br />And Cary ??!?<br />And Corrine?! What do these characters add to the story<br />And my biggest upset why in the world would you marry someone you can't even sleep in the same bed with!!!<br />And when did a safe word become the answer to ea saying I love you ?<br />There is not enough time to say everything wrong with this book
B009B2VBWE|5.0|She is super talented. Great album. Appreciated it even more after I saw her perform it in concert and understood her song choices more. She's fantastic!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have followed these books from the start, anxiously awaiting each new release. Harris has taken the reader through a magnificent and fantastical journey. Each character had a unique personality and I enjoyed getting to know them. With the release of the final book I was sad to see the story end but excited for another great read. For those majority of the book I was spellbound, unable to put it down. But all too soon the story ended up abruptly, almost as if Harris was tired of writing. I wasn't impressed by the ending and feel a little let down. After years of following Sookie I was hoping for an ending that matched the excitement and intensity of the other books. I'm sure others will think the end fits perfectly but I beg to differ. Nonetheless it was a great book and I am sad to see the series end.
0425263924|1.0|I really enjoyed Bared to You and Reflected in You.  So, I pre-ordered Entwined With You.  Pre-ordered in August of 2012 ... yeah, that's right ... that's just how much I liked the first two books in this TRILOGY.  As everyone is painfully aware now, the release date changed so many times I lost count.  Then I get emails and texts this morning from friends who stayed up all night reading EWY and were hopping mad not only about the ending and lack of real progression in the story, BUT also the fact that this is no longer a trilogy--2 more books planned.  I wonder if it'll even end there?  So, I hopped online and checked it out for myself.  I was truly stunned by all of the 1 star reviews for this book considering how highly anticipated it was by fans and how hyped it was by its author and others.  It was at that point that I decided, \\"I'm done with this.\\"  I'm done being jerked around to the tune of $9.99 a book (EBOOK for crying out loud--no trees killed!) only to find out that the author is going to keep milking my wallet instead of finishing the story as promised.  Then, I did something I have NEVER done before with any book ... I asked for a refund.  I am no longer playing this game.  There are far too many authors out there that respect their fans enough not to lead them on in this manner.  The fans of Eva and Gideon deserved better.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love the book, love them. I could read it over and over and never get tired of it. So excited about third book
B0063IH60K|2.0|I have used other formats on computers that are much more user friendly thant this one.  I just deleted it
0425263924|4.0|Knowing that this was the third book to a 5 book series, I thought It was a solid continuation to their story. There were all the same elements that Sylvia Day brought us in the first two books.  There were secrets revealed but more to uncover with a lot of material to warrant two more books.  I'm looking forward to continuing the journey.

0425263924|3.0|I was so excited to finally read this book.... I live in Switzerland and was able to purchase it via amazon Germany .<br /><br />I have the feeling that Ms Day and her publishers are out to string this story along to cash in on our interest in Gideon / Eva.<br /><br />This book basically rehashes the previous books and is filled in with a MASSIVE amount of sex scenes.  I love the intimate play between the main characters but this was bordering on too much of a good thing!<br /><br />Hopefully we will not have to wait two years for parts 4 & 5 !<br /><br />Ms Day get your act together! There are so many other fantastic authors out there ready willing and able to steal your crown!
B008YCMM2A|5.0|Three CD's and one DVD of the &#34;Lost Band&#34; - the Shorter, Corea, Holland & DeJohnette band from 1968-1970 - recorded in Europe in 1969. Very good to excellent performances recorded very well and presented excellently. A must have for Miles collectors.

B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|I was kinda hoping for a Shayamalan comeback (as far as I am concerned, Signs was his last decent work, though I have personal conjectures as to why that are perhaps wishful thinking in being kind to him about that.)  This movie... was better than some of his, and I did appreciate some attention to detail... the way the ship was made, and parts of it operated kept my attention... but the plot of the movie itself was very narrow and linear... and didn't really offer any surprises... or anticipation for what you thought might be coming, either.  It felt as if it had already happened, 20 minutes in, and one spent the rest of the movie waiting for the inevitabilities to catch up with you.  I'm also, I have to say, getting a bit weary of the automatic 'evil = ugly = evil' equation and irretrievable and singleminded adversaries thing.  Just once, I want to be surprised to find out that the massive, ugly, terrifying creature is the good guy and that humans are not always the hapless victim.
193700788X|5.0|I thought the story tied up most loose ends.<br />Sookie did not end up with Eric. I know people wanted her to end up with him- but get the hell over it. She did not.<br />Ms. Harris wrote the book. YOU did not.<br />I cannot believe there are so many haters on the site.<br />Shame on Amazon for not having better control over the content on this board.<br />It is ok to have a negative opinion- but some of the hatefulness and bitterness is awful.<br />If you did not like how the book ended- write your own book.<br />In fact- write your own series and have HBO make a television series from of it.<br />How often does that happen? I bet you think you can do it.<br />I bet you can write so that Bill, Sookie and Eric can all have a threesome.<br />Wouldn't that be fun to read? Hey let's throw Pam in there too.<br />I bet you would like it.<br />Then everyone can end up with the partner of YOUR choice.<br />Everyone can be happy.
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|Yes, some of the songs sound alike... a lot do, but I think, given what I know about Black Veil Brides, this was intended to be a journey, and thus sounding alike is perfectly fine. My favorite song from this is Lost It All.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a great app...love it on my new Kindle Fire HD. I have played previously and it works great.
B00012QM8G|5.0|With some of my favourite actors in it, I really enjoy this film. I believe you will, as well, if you are not too sensitive to violence. However, I think, to some extent, we need to see things a bit how they were, so we can really feel that time, and feel the pain and outrage that it should give us.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Sylvia Day always starts out strong, then ends in disappointment with her &#34;series.&#34; What a joke. We should of gotten a conclusion. I am not interested in all of these other characters. It just seems like a way to d..r..a..g out the series. Finish with Eva and Gideon, then give the other characters their own book if that's the way your going.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|The Historical authenticity of it is a bit off, but it is pretty decent for a television show that didn't intend to be authentic. I like it. Craig and Andy are GREAT actors. (RIP, Andy.)
1401229921|5.0|This has become my new bible/reference for drawing.  Its truly amazing to see Jim Lee's raw pencils in over 200+ pages!  Its amazing!  If you like his art this is a must have!
B0072OFM28|3.0|... is what makes this watchable. I recommend the first season of this show, but as it goes on, the &#34;unique speech&#34; becomes more like caveman-talk, and the &#34;slow-mo&#34; becomes exceedingly overdone. It also becomes so much more soap-opera, and the story seems to falter. It is historically bad, but a good action flick for those who like soap-opera action flicks. Craig Parker is really a very good actor, and it is a shame he did not get more screen time in the first, but he does in this one, at least. I'd still buy it, for his part in it, if I had not, already.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Grandkids love this movie. There are a some parts that are a little scary for little ones. All ends well. Some great lessons here.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|i really enjoyed this cd. the song selection was quite good, especially for a frank and nancy sinatra fan like me. i also love the oldies and really appreciated &#34;to love someboy&#34; and &#34;who's loving you.&#34; lastly, i had never heard &#34;come dance with me&#34; before. immediately it became my favorite on the cd. buble generates joy through his singing and he didn't disappoint on this collection of crooners, love songs, and dance numbers.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book, just finished it last night and cant' wait to read the second book.  This book has every supernatural creature that I love to read about.  Plenty of action and a few twists throughout the book, some I was predicting but the twist at the end threw me for a loop and now I'm craving more.  The writing is clear making it very easy to visualize the world she paints, although some of the character descriptions are a bit dry.  Not sure why so many reviewers compare Clary to Harry, I don't think they are anything alike.  If you liked Harry Potter, you may not like this book.  I for one did not enjoy the Potter books, but I did enjoy this book.  Happy reading!!!

B000E1MTZE|5.0|All time best trilogy - philosophy, prophesy, cinematography, acting.  It simply does not get any better than this Wachowski brothers production.<br /><br />- PETER KIMBIS
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is great that Minecraft has been made into a pocket-sized version! Overall, everything is the same, just like in PC. Great for entertaining yourself. Get this game.<br />Its worth it.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|Wonderful characters that are wiser than their years - works for me.  A must read.  Green's novels bring you right back into the angst of youth.  Feels as  real as the first go around.<br /><br />Peter Kimbis
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow amazing book so exotic yet such a great storyline best book I have ever read. Easy to put yourself right into character. Awesome.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|First I really liked the Crossfire novel. However I was disappointed in some aspects. First I thought there was too much drama. I felt the author just wanted to fill the pages and had more drama then was needed. Second I just wanted a epilogue. The ending had a hea however it did not feel like it was over and I wanted that. I feel the author is writing more for money then for actually writing for the love of it. I enjoyed reading the 3 books however I don't know if I would start reading any more from the author.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Slow getting into but it's a great book, all 3 are great.  No need to go on and on, that's what you read the book for.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I'm a big fan of t&s, and I'm crazy about this CD. it's great for singing, dancing, and listening. Enough like their other stuff, but different enough to keep it interesting and new. Great album!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This gives great insight into the real Germany and the differences between &#34; The party&#34; and the Germans who were fighting for their country, it opened my eyes about Nazis and people who lived in Germany
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Did a decent job of making sure it's playable except when you have anything that cost more than fifty acorns. Not to many glitches except when you play a lot.then it seems to get tierd
B00A8LYYI0|1.0|This film should really be a rental. I have no reason to watch it again except to note inacuracies and mistakes. If you are a fan of the series, you will really be disappointed how far apart this is from the series. A lot of the scenes, inconsistencies, and dialogue can be seen as just used for movie magic (or show off some cgi and 3D effects)  and really had no place in the film.  You will leave yourself at the end of the film wondering, why did that happen? Or, this didn't make sense. Even if you did not play the games, you'll notice the inconsistencies as the movie went on.
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|I like all the fun and challenging levels and cute characters. The hearts are sometimes hard to collect but that is what makes it challenging. The (extra) snow levels have lots of fun loops and mountains.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|At the end of the book you feel like you have stopped in the middle of it. There are too many loose ends. Its one thing to leave the reader hanging but this is just ridiculous!  After waiting for so long to get this book it is a huge disappointment. I agree with a previous review.....had I known how drawn out this series was going to be I would have waited until all the books were out.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|Great book hahahahahahahhahahhahahahahahhahahhahhahahhahhahah anyways good enough well I'm chilling hahaha and the only thing I don't know if you can get to be that goooooooooood
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|loved everything about this game....my kids love it too! im definitely getting the next version of it! its a must have....fun for every age!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is like none I've seen before, it left me craving more and I can't wait for the next installment
0525425772|5.0|I bought this book for my son who is 10 and he never read it so since I read about any thing I see from J. Grisham I read it. Its a kids book,not a bad book its just a kids book.The boook was in great shape and shipped quick so its a 5 star in my book.
B00005JL96|5.0|awesome....loved it. My grand children were going nuts after seeing lilo and stitch for the first time. Thank you again.
0763619612|5.0|Used it for an art project.  Read the book to my class.  Students created their dot (\\"Make your mark and see where it leds you\\").  Wonderful short book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is probably the best book so far in this series. It is not as sad as the last book.
B00933JL0A|4.0|I would give it  five it got  four because it won't let me continue all the levels with one village but other than that I love this little game
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have watched  my brother play this on his iPod and I was always so jealous because this game is so amazing. I am glad they finally came out with this go  th  kindle
0446554995|1.0|This book is obviously written for long-time fans of Pendergast. I got the audiobook from my library and rue the day I decided to invest all this time in listening. I kept thinking that somewhere along the way the vastly different story lines would converge and that never happened. So as I read comments here I realize that the other two characters would possibly be meaningful to me if I had known Pendergast novels already. If I had, I probably wouldn't have picked this one up because of the inplausibility of the plot. All in all, it helped me pass the time while walking and gardening, but wasn't a good choice.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|this is a fun game but it has a pretty steep learning curve and it is very easy to get frustrated and quit.
0525478817|5.0|No word in this world would describe how perfect this book is.<br />I didnt think I'd like to read this book, but it's my favorite one now.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I saw the preview for the movie and decided I would read the book first...and I wasn't disappointed. This book grabbed me from the start and held me ask the way through. It was hard to put down. I stayed up way to late, read on my breaks at work, skipped lunch. The only disappointment I felt was that the book ended.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I NOW HAVE ALL 3 QUELL GAMES AND I LIKE THESE GAMES VERY MUCH!!  THEY ARE NOT THE USUAL<br />&quot;BEEN THERE DONE THAT&quot; GAME. PLEASE KEEP THEM COMING.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|The book blows. Never read it at all. A total pyschological book with a twisted yet interesting documentaries. Over all buy a different book.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Okay...so...finished Entwined with You and I don't do spoilers...I will say this.... I was sooo worked up over what I had read from other readers saying how they hated this book and how the end was a cliffhanger and how it pissed them off etc . Reasons I rarely ever read what people have to say before I read it. I  did have some anxiety reading this (not gonna lie...I often have anxiety when I read...I often yell and scream and curse out loud too)....I did all of those things during this book.  I was positive that I was going to be angry and pissed off at the end like others had said......I can see where they said they didn't like this one as much.  Yes...There were several things that did drag on a bit, a lot of things repeated / brought up that happened in previous books, alot of time spent on new characters etc  and yes every time you turn around they are having sex =)  But isn't that why we love Gideon?  ;) People are pissed off at it now NOT being a trilogy....so what if it's now going to be 5 books... I mean we still have alot of unanswered questions....things to wrap up....One more book about them will do that I am sure.... and if she wants to have a book about other characters.... good for her!  Anyway..... I expected something super major to happen at the end because of what other readers had said.  How it pissed them off and how it was such a cliffhanger.... I mean when I hear the word cliffhanger I think..... holy mother of all freaking Cliffhangers.........Didn't happen!  Yes...it leaves us hanging,  because Eva (Angel) and Gideon's  (Ace) journey isn't over yet.  I wasn't pissed off at all at how it ended.  Was I happy with the way their relationship came together in this one.... YES! YES! YES!  &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 and that is all I will say about that! ;)  I will continue to support Sylvia Day whether it's one more book of five more books because isn't that why we read....to fall in love with characters and their stories......

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game was good but short. I don't mind paying for games but if they were longer it would be more worth<br /> it
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|it was quite annoying because you have to pay to get men and weapons I was quite surprised about it it`s not epic

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Rating: A ... Heat: Warm<br /><br />**May contain minor spoilers. Spoilers aren't my intention. I mention who the hero is - but not who The Ghost is. You don't know 100% who it is till 2/3 in. There's so much going on in this book that it isn't the focus.**<br /><br />This is the book all Psy-Changeling fans have been waiting for! Well, other than Hawke's book, which was one I desperately wanted from the very beginning. In Heart of Obsidian we get answers. Big answers. So many things happen that I'm hesitant to say anything at all. What should you know? Nalini Singh is pure genius--dark, twisted, and brilliant--and in Heart of Obsidian her genius really shines through.<br /><br />Singh took a character I wasn't fond of and, in some instances, despised, and made him... well, not human, but... understandable. Relatable. She managed to keep him unapologetically true to character, a very dark sort of character, and made me feel for him. Care for him. Fall deeply, madly in love with an unscrupulous and ruthless man.<br /><br />Kaleb Krycheck, former Councilor, is cold and inscrutable. A man known for his unconscionable deeds and his mercenary attitude. Kaleb is dedicated to one cause so completely he'd end the world for it. And, as a dual Cardinal with off-the-charts Tk abilities, he could - and would - end the world. Kaleb is a man so full of darkness, you don't want to like him. I actively fought not to like him. But the more you know, the deeper you fall into his darkness. He's a man capable of anything. So when he kidnaps a woman, who was previously kidnapped years ago and held captive - and steals her for himself, his motivations and reasons aren't obvious.<br /><br />That woman, Sahara Kyriakus, is lost in her own mind. In a labyrinth of her own making. She turned her mind into a puzzle that her captors could never solve. The only person who can is Sahara herself. When she finds her usual windowless cage is swapped with another, and a new jailer is introduced, she remains on guard. Except nothing about this man who's taken her makes sense. He allows her freedoms and concessions and gives her truthful answers. Its disarming, confusing, and causes her defenses to begin unraveling all on their own.<br /><br />Kaleb and Sahara... left me breathless. A broken Psy and a Silent Councilor. From their very first interactions, I was in their thrall. There have been cold men in the Psy-Changeling series, Jude was made of ice till Brenna thawed him some, but with Kaleb--there is no thawing. He's too powerful. He's too... much. His chill is to the marrow. And Sahara never tries to change him, because she knows the consequences would be too dire. To have a hero like Kaleb... he might not melt, but he sure as heck finds a way to melt you. Sahara stood no chance against a man so... impressively tenacious. The truth is a very powerful thing and he gives it to Sahara when no one else would. Even if it means she'll run from him.<br /><br />And all of this takes place in the midst of the Psy civil wars that are bleeding out into the other races. Pure Psy is amping up their destruction and the casualties are piling up. Things are racing toward a big, big final showdown between Pure Psy and... well, everyone else. Inter-species relationships will never be the same. The Psy will never be the same. Good or bad, this book is a game changer.<br /><br />Heart of Obsidian is intense on all levels--the romance, the action, the emotions, the drama. Nalini Singh has written a book that's savage in its intensity. It will rock you. The Psy-Changeling world is already impressive, but this book will leave you awestruck. I can't wait to see were Singh takes it from here.remains on guard. Except nothing about this man who's taken her makes sense. He allows her freedoms and concessions and gives her truthful answers.

B00CW665VI|4.0|I think I may have a new boyfriend and girl crush! Drew Evans and Kate Brooks are a terrific duo--sassy, independent, hot and perfect for each other.  Despite being a boorish, man-whore (just keeping it real!) Drew evolves into \\"the man his Mom raised him to be\\" as the book progresses.  Locker room talk notwithstanding, hearing the story from his POV is a great change of pace.  Some of his lines are hilarious, though not really believable, as he brings us along on his journey from borderline creep to a man in love.  Kate, too, is a multi-faceted character--intelligent, whip-smart professional with a more humble background who falls for Drew in spite of herself.  Their chemistry is fantastic.<br /><br />Here's my downside: Drew's \\"grand gestures\\" to win Kate over are just silly.  He stopped being a character and became a caricature with the three-piece band, room full of balloons and skywriter. Also, the use of the c-word in describing Kate's anatomy is a deal breaker for me.  As the book went on I felt like I could have been reading Penthouse Forum. Sorry, Emma Chase. You're better than that~!<br /><br />Bottom line:  Fun, sexy read whose description sometimes cross the line from steamy to skanky/Great dialog/Interesting secondary characters--Dee Dee, Mackenzie/Fantastic rapport between our hero and heroine/Strong characters who you really like!<br />Don't miss this one...
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was so excited about this book because I love the first and second book. But now, I'm sad I bought it. Nothing major happened, I felt bored reading the entire book. I felt that Brett and Corrine were just fillers. I use to love this author but now I don't really like her because it seems that she is prolonging the ending because she wants to write another book which means more money.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Lived up to my expectations, which were very high.  The previous book in the series was a bit of a place holder, but this book more then redeems itself.  Although there are still some dangling stories, the main story arc has a satisfactory resolution.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I've honestly tried to give this author and her novels a chance. But her books and writing style has totally missed the mark. One of the problems I know for sure, is that her crossfire novel are trying to copy the same essence of Fifty Shades, and she has missed the mark by a long shot. This book is unrealistic and just rumbles on and on about nothing. What a waste of my time and money. This will be my last time purchasing any of this authors books.

B00B89WXYS|4.0|I have a shirt that says `Ryan Tedder is God'.  I've kind of been obsessed with him for a while now.  Seeing OneRepublic in concert was the kicker for me, since every word that fluttered from his lips was kissed with this heavenly aura and just gave me chills.  His voice is a godsend and I'll debate that to death with anyone.  As a producer and a song writer, he's impeccable.  With all of that said, I have yet to be completely won over by the entirety of a OneRepublic album, and `Native', their third outing, is no different.  I really like this album, as have I liked `Waking Up' and `Dreaming Out Loud', but there is always this feeling of `unfinished work' associated with their albums for some reason.<br /><br />They feel incomplete.<br /><br />Despite the fact that Tedder can produce and write killer hooks, and he shows that off on his own albums as well as those of others, he tends to run out of ideas on a collective front.  His albums carry this stigma of `filler track' that pollutes their impact.  While tracks like `If I Lose Myself' and `Can't Stop' are beautifully composed and original in conception and execution, tracks like `Counting Stars' and `I Lived' feel like variations of their previous works.  I really want them to deliver an album that feels perfect from start to finish, but they recycle their sounds too often.<br /><br />Evolve, please.  I know you can!<br /><br />Despite my issues with the album as a whole, the fact remains that what they present is very good.  Even the familiar tracks are still above average and better than the majority of what we hear on the radio.  `Au Revoir' and `Burning Bridges' and beautiful songs with such poetic melody, and the upswing on `Feel Again' will play perfect on the stage.  They have a knack for creating songs that feel like a movement, with `I Lived' (despite feeling like something I've heard them do before) being almost anthem worthy and `Something I Need' containing a killer chorus that will get the whole car chanting in unison.<br /><br />So, `Native' is a very good album but I wanted it to be perfect.  Instead, OneRepublic continue with their trend of consistent, likable music that lacks carries the promise and potential of creative genius but fails to live up to it in the long run.chanting in unison.<br /><br />So, `Native' is a very good album but I wanted it to be perfect.

B007ZYK3CE|1.0|Use of the f word is excessive and not needed for the plot.  So offensive I couldn't enjoy the movie.
1401322786|1.0|I almost threw this book out the window. I gave it a good try and read about 50 pages but the book goes no where. The author's writing style is not for me. The themes were not nuanced and I found everything to be clich&eacute; and obvious. Do not waste your time.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Just posting to counter all of the ridiculous, immature, and childish negative reviews that were clearly written by people who really need to grow up. WRITING IN ALL CAPS DOESN'T MAKE YOUR POINT MORE VALID. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE AS A CASUAL MOVIE GOER.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much. It started of slow but once it finally got started I couldn't put it down! I hope they decide to make another movie to the series.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|This book was quite enjoyable. I'd even have given it five stars, except that it got rather confusing at parts and I felt like the love relationship between the main characters was just kind of tacked on at the end.<br /><br />I had heard some other reviews say the cast of characters got confusing, so while I was reading it, I tried to pay special attention to each of the names, but even then, I still got a little turned around. I'm guessing that middle grade readers would too. As for the love story, I know this is middle grade reading level, which means that love stories aren't often developed fully, but even so, I didn't really see much of the attraction between Sophie and Howl and yet somehow they're betrothed in the end.<br /><br />The magic and whimsy of the world was very original. The whole book was very fun and humorous. I think this book would be even better the second time around (since you'd know everything that was going on and could easily make sense of it all).
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I am really enjoying this game. It is along the same type as Temple Run. I like the different challenges like the little doll  to collect while in Tokyo. Looking forward to the next city.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|V for Vendetta remains true to its source material while avoiding the pitfalls of a slavishly faithful adaptation. I'll be honest -  the movie would be dull and plodding if it included everything in the second book of the graphic novel. Slow and dreary sideplots do little to add to a film's experience and invariably end up causing viewers to glance at their timepieces.<br /><br />Fortunately, the creators know how to make an entertaining movie while staying true to the spirit of the comic. Hugo Weaving is exemplary as the psychotic yet compassionate terrorist V, and Stephen Fry adds black humour to a depressing film about power-hungry corporatists. The hypocrisy of fascist dictatorships is put on display in all its ugliness. High Chancellor Sutler is not content to refrain from enjoying music he does not approve of. He must also outlaw anything that has offended him or is used as a threat to his rule.<br /><br />The plot is very similar to the movie, with Evey staying at Deitrich's house instead of that of a generous stranger. V's Shadow Gallery is recreated in extreme detail and faithfulness. Delia's atrocities are reproduced to a starkly realistic effect, and are alone worth the price of admission.<br /><br />The tale behind the regime's rise to power (not detailed in the comics) is given the royal treatment, providing further enjoyment and deeper enjoyment for fans of the comic. The film's strongest point lies in Evey's incarceration, and although the ending doesn't quite follow the books, it is still powerful and inspiring.

0399157565|4.0|Just as in line with all of her other books, suspenseful, and not boring to read. Keeps you waiting for the next book.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The only reason I can not give a 5 star review is because I felt there was not ending, or cliffhanger, It did not have an ending.  I loved watching how strong Eva and Gideon's relationship and love have grown throw out their time apart from Book 2.  Slyvia Day wrote an amazing book; Corrine is still up to her usual to try to get Gideon, we see Brett in this book and we are introduced to more of Gideons past but through out it Eva is more secure and strong in their relationship.  My only issue is that I hope we do not have to wait for Book 4 and Book 5 to come out because I have more questions.  We see that Eva has come to terms with Nathan's death and the horrible things he did to her, with Gideon's help but I can also see that Gideon has to face his demons and can see why another book is needed.  Did I mention Gideon's mother has took out the biatch claws yep...take a chance and read it their is no ending but you do see growth from the pair

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Its hard to write a review without spoilers, so I'm going to be brief: I love Brandon's writing style, the book is dynamics and just vibrates with events, and unexpected turns.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'd select 0 stars if I could. As a disclaimer, I didn't even read the book. The reviews on Amazon were quite enough to turn me off from reading another Crossfire novel. I am disappointed and disgusted with this blatant example of pure and unadulterated greed on the part of Ms. Day and her publishers. I loved the first book... I loved the ending of the second book. I waited all winter (and winters are long where I am) for the third book. I purchased it this morning, went to work, came back and read the reviews and have returned the book for a full refund. Complete bait and switch. Like others I checked Ms. Day's FB page. What a load of BS about her never saying anything about this being a trilogy. I am DONE with this series and Ms. Day. Talk about telling how I really feel. :)<br /><br />Better for getting that off my chest anyway.
B000006OHL|4.0|This is a great soundtrack! The music composition is like the movie itself: tense yet soft.  The music swells and then fades off. Overall great jazz music to a great film. \\"Thank God for The Rain\\" is by far my favorite track! This is the soundtrack to get!

B00571F26Y|4.0|I do not have celiac disease however I am gluten sensitive. Whole grain is definitely my enemy (completely cut it out after a trip to the ER keeled over in unexplainable stomach pain after going on a whole grain + chicken + veggies only kick) and so I can stand in agreement with the author on most of his writings. I would consider this book to be more helpful for those gluten sensitive than anything else. His \\"weight loss\\" advice is pretty stupid. Cheese is fatty and eating a ton of cheese will make you fatter. Period. The same also applies to olive oil, nuts, avocados, etc. And OMG DID HE REALLY SUGGEST EATING MAYO? GROSS! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!<br /><br />After cutting out grain products completely my belly went down, my skin cleared up, I could sleep better, I was less moody, and I had an increased amount of energy. I do try to avoid white jasmine rice however I eat small portions of basmati and wild rice. \\"Gluten free\\" products in my experience seem to be loaded with fat and sodium so I don't bother with them. I do like quinoa though and have no problems with it, however everyone is different. I actually eat 1-2 very small apples a day for the fiber (digestion) and the small amounts of natural sugar they give me. I don't agree with cutting fruit out but I do believe in minimizing it.<br /><br />If you are gluten sensitive and trying to lose weight I highly recommend reading this book and taking it with a grain of salt. Try to follow the principles of a paleo diet and take a probiotic to aid your condition (I take ortho biotic and it really helps). To give you an idea of a day in my life it goes like this:<br /><br />Breakfast: small coffee with almond milk and stevia, egg white omelet with fresh spinach, tomato and mushroom cooked only using a few sprays of olive oil based pan spray or coconut oil if available<br />Snack: Small apple<br />Gym<br />Lunch: Stove grilled chicken (only cooked using pan spray or coconut oil) and seasoned with light salt and pepper + salad<br />Snack: Small apple<br />Dinner: Chicken + Salad or grilled veggies on top of quinoa<br /><br />Beverages: Water, non sodium club soda and the occasional can of diet coke<br />Alcohol: ONLY drink white rum with diet coke or champagne depending on the occasion<br /><br />It's boring but it's fast, easy and keeps me healthy and at optimal weight. I have one or two days a month for \\"special events\\" such as birthdays or girls night out dinners where I allow myself to mix things up. With regular gym trips and clean eating they don't affect me too poorly.<br /><br />P.S. I should add that I can eat breads and grain products in other countries with no issue for some reason. I blame America's processed food obsession.
0385536828|5.0|I liked this book  and the way the author writes.  The main character being an agent and a woman made for some fun reading. I liked it almost as much as Atonement.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was ready to spend twice as much for a backpack style camera bag.  None of the \\"steal me\\" labels of the more expensive counterparts, plenty of room, and a very good price.  Holds everything I have and then some.
B00009RGBS|1.0|The DVD I received was damaged and I will need to return it for a refund or replacement.  It would not play certain parts and repeated others.
B00APJLFEG|1.0|There was something about this film that made me nauseous.  I didn't like the animation and how it rips off Nightmare B4 Xmas, Coraline and Corpse Bride.  The story was basic and typical simplistic.  I guess kids would like it but these type of movies are a dime a dozen.  Loud and ignorant.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this series. Good plot, great acting. The characters seem true to the period. Great interaction between characters.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|OK I finally like a Marky Mark movie.  He's been in hundreds of films and this is the only one I enjoyed (the ones I have seen).  It comes off obnoxious and toilet and teddy's voice was hard to adjust to at first but I ended up just going with it and soon found out I related to the character and the story.  I'm a typical guy and I can't pretend that alot of the humour I can relate to, Sorry!  I'm a pig like most men.  I also like Mila Kunis.  I think she's one of the best new school actresses and she's beautiful.  So I like this movie and the marky mark song Good Vibration.  Mark Walberg is cool in my book thank God.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed watching this series. I heard many people talking about Downton Abbey but did not have the opportunity to watch it before now. Glad I did. Wish I could watch season 4 right away but will need to wait.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This is an excellent movie but nothing i would buy or ever watch again.  It did have me tearing up at certain parts, the boy who played the main character was fantastic.  It's a compelling true life tragedy story.  United 93 was also a true life story on the same level as this film but i do think United 93 was done better.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Nice game would recommend too anyone, it is a must have. easy at first then got hard at the end
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Good improvements over other BTD games.  More features (upgrade selections).  I have played this game for about two months and still enjoy it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A Fantastic and confusing game that requires lots of thinking but it's awesome. Great puzzle game that bites at your brain.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Barbra Streisand at her relaxed best.  I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it even if you aren't a Barbra fan.  It's a fun movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome!!! It is a great way to kill time when you just need something to do. I would recommend Subway Surfers to all of my friends
B000EOUSJU|5.0|\\"The Hoople\\" By Mott the Hoople Is What I Believe To Be Their Best Album. It Is Definitely A Show Case of What the Seminal 70's Band Could Put Out Live As Well As In the Studio.  The Best Song AS Far As It Goes Is \\"Marionette\\".  Mott the Hoople Led By Ian Hunter Was A Land Mark Rock Group that Fits In To Basically Any Genre of Rock Music Yesterday and Today.  Give \\"The Hoople\\" A Listen,.. You'll Like It!!!
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|very good movie very good film pic looks good and Audio he back top films ends up being a lot more entertaining
1931559317|5.0|This book is absolutely essential and this presentation of the book is the only version you should consider buying. The construction of this book is almost as impressive as the amazingly comprehensive catalog of stars indexed in this book. The laminated cover and spiral binding make it a practical option for bringing into the field and the charts themselves are easy to navigate if you know what you are looking at. It certainly is not as easy as a star finding app on a phone but this book, along with a red flashlight, is the absolute best way to preserve your night vision while stargazing.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Ian Rankin builds these characters and the story with lots of suspense and drama. Its a difficult book to put down each time you read some of the chapters or pages. Another gem.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|A must page turner, can't wait for the next &#34; Clifton Chronicles &#34;<br />Don't leave us cliff hanging,waiting for the shoe to drop.
1585104205|5.0|I have used the Berlitz method to learn a foreign language, and can compare that method to the traditional school-based approach of grammar and vocabulary learning combined with translation. This immersion method is very similar to the Berlitz method, and it is certainly - in my experience - an extremely helpful, low-stress and successful approach to learning. If you have tried the classical approach with little success, and if your ardour is not dampened, you would do well to buy this book. Beware though - you do need the accompanying books to obtain the most out of the course.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Love this movie! Don't understand how Bradley Cooper did not win the Best Actor Oscar for this role.  Great performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro.also.
0812993845|4.0|This book has tons more sex than past Sophie Kinsella novels.  I usually pass them on to my teenage daughters, but I won't be passing on this one.  However, it is still satisfying in the way that Kinsella always ties up her loose ends.  The book is told from the two different first person points of view of two sisters; it is a bit jolting at first, but the point of view helps the reader really identify with and feel for the characters.  It's a charming romance that is a fun summer read.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|not too bad of a game just seems like most of the other build style games but I do like the fighting aspect
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is easy to learn. Once you get a hang if it then it gets really hard to put down.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I chose this rating because I Iove a mystery at the beginning of a book.l liked that in the end people were in the garden and the garden had growing flowers.I would recommend this book to teachers for their students or kids who like gardens or flowers
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Makes you think and re-evalutate your food purchases. Dollar vote counts!<br />I've looked into buying local seasonal vegetables and fruits now.
B002QGSYRC|3.0|As a conservative republican I would have enjoyed this book more if it did not seem that the author had a political bias against republicans in general and \\"right wings\\" in particular.  My personal opinion - I'm sure that people on the left won't see it that way - but one example is describing the word \\"hate\\" to people you don't agree with.  The media does it all the time - republicans hate Obama, etc (dems never hated Bush?) but to see the author using this method to smear a particular political party - it makes me question how trustworthy a source is this guy as far as his historical views are concerned....
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this fun game. The whole family enjoys playing it. I love that it's non violent...no killing in this game!!! Also the graphics are really great and I really love the animation of all the animals.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I blazed right through the whole season in a single evening.  Very well done and thoroughly addicting. On to season two and then patiently sitting around waiting for season three.
B000VD5I94|4.0|movie looked great and it was worth paying for blue ray on an old movie. great price for a blue ray
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|If you are a fan of Tina Fey's work, you will love this book. She lays out her own particular neuroseses without apologies and delivers for laughs. She stands up for criticisms that are given to the women comics as a group and even lays bare her own hypocrises. Personal, warm and very funny.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|I love love love this movie. It is artistic, dramatic, and funny when it needs to be. The cinematography is exquisite, the narrative strong and the performances very powerful. This movie has really touched my heart and mind. I totally recommend it.
B000AYELVA|5.0|Seller used UPS instead of the Postal Service. This guaranteed reliability and the ability to track this package. I wish all buyers and sellers could stay away from the USPS of which you can lose a pkg using them. Great movie if your a fan of the XMEN.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I liked this game allot but I beat it within a week. temple run one was harder and more fun.. just get angry birds space or temple run one.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I ordered several episodes and now plan on getting the whole season. It is awesome and a great addition to my collection.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is the &quot;BOMB!&quot; It's so fun, cool, and addicting. The only problem I had was the ads after I upgraded it it started showing ads for Jimmy John's sandwiches I mean who wants to think about food in the middle of a game? (No offense) I just hope this gets fixed I really like this game
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I was worried when I read the reviews but I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire and it works just fine. no bugs or spyware! I don't see what the big deal is.
B00AMHFMIG|5.0|I came late to this party; but I love it and everyone should! Why is it so hard to have smart funny on TV. Thank goodness it is surviving; but it shouldn't have to try so hard to stay alive. Courtney Cox is a genius producer. Thank you! No laugh tracks!!! Again thank you Courtney!! I hate laugh tracks and I know how brave you gotta be to try going without them on American television. Maybe all shows could remove laugh tracks from the DVD releases. Yeah that's it.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Unlike the previous 4 records, this one didnt try to use the same formula and instead creating something that sounds different and fresh. The weakest track perhaps would be the title track and Cold sweat (never a fan of cover song), the best tune in my opinion would be Dance in the rain, Forget to remember and Begining of sorrow.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Season 2 continues the story of the intrigue between the various houses vying for power in Westeros. It also continues the story of Dany ( mother of dragons) as well as that of Jon Snow who is involved at the Wall in guarding the kingdom.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The story starts off slow, and I became confused several times during the first couple chapter due to the bouncing around from scene to scene and the Swedish names/words, but once I figured each character out and what the words meant I couldn't put the book down.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works great to search and buy. Fast to load. No issues so far. Will continue to use. Also great PayPal integration in app for purchases.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|You will love this book so much you will read this series a million times. You will love this book collection forever great job Suzanne Collins!!!!
0425263924|1.0|After waiting a long time for this book to be released, I was so bummed out to read the reviews!!!  I had pre-ordered, but just returned for a refund.  The only way I would consider buying this is if it is re-released at a quarter of the price.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like  this game.But I do'nt like the annoying pop-ups that come up before every time I play.But it's still good.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Sure we all thought Gideon and Eva would get there happily ever after and in a way they did! I was about half way through the book when I started seeing Facebook post about how unhappy people were with the ending I thought oh great how the heck will she leave us. I was not disappointed at all, a lot of stuff was uncovered and hashed out and really people are complaining about more Gideon and Eva!! I thought the story was really good and I am looking forward to more...hopefully it wont be too long!
B0080Y93H4|5.0|I listen to Kiosaki all the time...and I listen to his cds again and again...<br /><br />It has helped me start a business that I have so desperately racked my mind for a year.  I didn't know what to sell, but it clicked over time...when you listen to his advice over and over again, you do start to think and act like the rich...<br /><br />Will buy more of his cds, books, etc.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The paperback is less expensive than the digital version. I guess I'll stop at book 2 :(  I've also seen the other reviews that state this isn't the final book like we were lead to believe. No thank you.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Seriously creepy book. Really! Interesting but no justice and I am never satisfied when justice is not appropriately dispensed to a wrong doer
B0052ZQMLO|4.0|This is a pretty good dictionary for a casual reader. I am studying German just for hobby and it is being pretty useful. Sometimes it does not know something but the Duden's dictionary is a good complement in these cases.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I loved how he was only ever hers and would hand her the world if she but asked. But because she cares, she asked him to save it. It was a wonderful book, revealed several mysteries from the series. Loved it!
B000FBJF6Y|3.0|Always like reading about other cultures, but I was disappointed with the story.I was distracted by the 'white van' In a small community surely this van would have been spotted by the people she was following. The author could have easily pointed out that this particular van was a common mode of transport in that area; he didn't.<br />Easy reading, but I found myself asking too many questions that wasn't covered by the author, the above question being one of those.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Tangled, starts out with Drew out on the town meeting women, when he finds a beautiful women to take home. But she's not buying what he has to sell. Kate turns him down, but ends up being a women he has to work with. Drew doesn't know what just happened to screw up everything, but now he totally wants this women, and maybe not just for a night. He even realizes that he doesn't just want her body. He knows that she is brilliant, witty, and everything he could ever need.  This book was completely romantic, even if the guy was a complete jerk off sometimes. Because sometimes he could be amazingly sweet.<br /><br />\\"I'm going to make you so happy, Drew Evans.\\" My arms tighten around her. \\"You already have. After this? Heaven's going to be a major disappointment.\\"<br /><br />Drew is really good at being so arrogant that he may even lose the only women he ever loves if he doesn't straighten up his act. This book was in Drew's point of view, and it was seriously hilarious. I laughed so many times. Like when I read this for instance when Drew finally grows a conscience, and decides to just be there for Kate when some bad things happen in her life.<br /><br />\\"If I could, I would squash that Jiminy Cricket (person) like the roach he is.\\"<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. It was super funny, filled with witty characters. And lots of  passion, and drama. I highly recommend this book, and I can not wait to read more.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Please write more on these characters if you have not already! I wish I was Abby and yes,  and I would fall for a guy like Travis! I finished this book in one day! Wow! I would recommend this book to anyone a hundred times over! I would say this book would make great movie or mini series !
B0053O8ARI|4.0|Kat Dennings, whom caught my attention in Marvel's Thor, is Max Black and  plays opposite/roommate/friend/business partner of Beth Behrs, Caroline Channing.  This comedy has potential to reach higher level of popularity if it restructured some of it's cast, crude humor and pointless subplots and just focus on the friendship of Max and Caroline, their pursuit to become something more than two waitresses in one of the worse diners to ever be on television.  The secondary/supporting cast bring nothing to the show, the relationship with Caroline's pet horse, Chestnut brings more heart and realism than the rest of the cast. The first season is setting up the show, but hopefully season two speeds up the girls goals of making enough money to fully launch their cupcake business. What I love about this show is their determination to become more, even Caroline, who has to overcome her father's criminal past; both girls have their troubled past and find a way to form this fun and hilarious friendship that seems possible for two young struggle against the world.  Max's dark and sexual humor is great, because I can relate to using humor to deal with stresses of life; Carline's willingness to make something out of herself, hopefully learn from her father's mistakes is truly nice to watch these girls grow.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|\\"Do you look for trouble to get into?  Or does it just find you?\\"<br /><br />If you weren't a fan of the series up to this point, don't bother.  If you have the attention span of a goldfish and can't stop texting long enough to actually pay attention, don't bother.  If you actually think \\"reality TV\\" is real... never mind.<br /><br />As deep as you want to look there is something to find in this film.<br /><br />Action junkies who live for the thrill of explosions and gunfire will see it.  There is the obligatory femme fatale eye candy, although the trailer showed more skin than the actual film.  There is an underlying message that success lies in getting up off the ground when you take the punch.  And there is a prodigal son motif.  IF, that is, you care to actually stop, look, and listen.<br /><br />Any story, though, contains an implicit contract.  The listener agrees to a suspension of disbelief as long as the teller doesn't push it too far.  The story teller agrees to push right to the line of that disbelief but not cross it.<br /><br />Usually follow up films will cross that line.  And the more films in the family, the more likely the line will be crossed.<br /><br />I will be the first to admit that somewhere around the third film, I fell into the category of \\"how much crap can happen to one guy?\\"  I felt that the envelope had been pushed too far.<br /><br />However, as usual, when the \\"critics\\" said it was bad, I said, \\"well, then I'll probably like it\\".  And, I'm glad I did.<br /><br />This film succeeds.  It presses against the boundary of \\"no it didn't\\" without quite crossing it.  You didn't really expect an orange to fall from an apple tree did you?<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, it was A Good Day to Die Hard.
B00CJ1PXNW|5.0|Many of the other reviews have nailed what these guys can produce.  Easily one of my favorite bands.  Every song is on my playlist.
1577314808|5.0|Sometimes, you have to be lucky to read a book at the right time/period of your life.<br />If I had read this book more than a year ago, I am sure I would have hated it, thought it was just a bunch of fancy words and nothing more.<br />For the past year, however, I went through a lot of changes which made me aware of is important in my life.<br />This book, indeed, seemed natural. It felt as every word is talking to a part of me that had been ignored for a long period. I did not have to put an effort into understanding it.<br /><br />I liked the Question-Answer style. It did seem quite convincing and made the book more fascinating and fun to read.<br /><br />I hope it is also a right time in your life you are coming across reading this book. It has been a treasure in my life, thanks to a good friend's suggestion.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I am a Vampire Diaries buff and really enjoy the fact that I can pre-order the seasons through amazon.  I love how it just arrived in the mail once it became available and of course I love the show so not much more to say about the product itself.
0380713802|4.0|After reading some of the worst reviews, I decided to check the book out of the library to see if there was any truth to them.  I am guessing those reviewers  are from those countries or are young.  Anyone who has backpacked around Europe in their 20s pre-internet days and then revisited the continent in their 30s or 40s know how much your experience changes.  You see things differently as you age.  People view and treat you differently.  Countries have changed as communism collapsed, democracies developed, and economies have been on a roller coaster.  He is completely correct when he talks about how being a tourist nowadays is worse than decades ago. He still finds the humor in each place he visits.  When I retell my stories of being pickpocketed in Barcelona, beg bugs in the hostel in Poland, etc., I still remember my trips fondly. Travelers expect that; vacationers are the ones who get upset about it. If you enjoy Bryson's humor, you will like this book too.<br />p.s. To the one star reviewer who got upset that he called waiting on tables an inferior job, I waited on tables in college.  Get over it.  It is not a high skilled job anyone should devote his/her life to.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I really like the feature where you can listen to what you've written. I would've liked to have the color resemble a notebook more but it's still great. I didn't really know how to work anything at first but I figured most of it out. It's just what I wanted!
B007ZKJY00|5.0|This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then I recommend you do
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My children LOVE this movie! It is now a bedtime ritual to end the day saying &#34;I love you, blah blah blah blah!&#34; So wonderful. We watch it over and over! I suggest it for almost any age!
B005LAII8A|5.0|Looper is an awesome movie. I thought it was original something I have not seen done yet. which i'm happy about i'm tired of seeing the same thing over and over again. I thought bruce willis and joseph levitt-gordon did an outstanding job together and Emily blunt was awesome two. the little kid who played cid did a terrific job. he will be a great up coming actor. the story was great and original this was a great film. the ending sucked but it made sence. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Although more complex than Season 1, it does not disappoint! I love watching every moment of it.  I treasure each episode more than each previous one.
B008220D5K|5.0|I love comedy crisis. this movie was hilarious. I really don't think that happens at the age of 40 but who knows. i'm only 30. I thought that paul rudd and leslie mann were hilarious and had good chemistry. judd apatow knows how to make comedies i'll tell you that. all in all this movie is a good movie if you just want something to laugh at. if you have not seen this movie then I re4commend you do
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|Almost 60 and still love to listen to music.  These days, not much out thats good-a lot of crap... Saw Rod had a latest release. Listened to samples on Amazon and from there, thought not bad.  Just bought CD and listened all the way through. Really, really enjoyed it. Had good upbeat, up tempo songs and even enjoyed the slower songs.  What a good surprise.  Read several \\"Reviews\\" over internet, most giving the record 2.5 out of 5.  Think they missed this one.  Enjoy this more than other cd's recently purchased.  Way to go Rod...
B00008LNR8|5.0|This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then I recommend you do
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Great show, lots of mystery!  I can't put my kindle down from watching it.  I'm on season 2 now and love it.
B009PNUO9K|5.0|This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then I recommend you do
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have not been able to put this book down.  It is exciting and I can't wait to turn the page!
B00007BH5C|5.0|This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then I recommend you do
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book, but this is the only instance where neither ruins the other for you!  The movie and book are both great and I highly recommend both!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|This is one of the best true military stories I have ever seen. it is good that they made this movie because it is a part of American history. the director did an amazing job on this film. and the main actress did an outstanding performance. this is a must see film. I was shocked to see where bin laden was actually hiding I would of never guessed it. ten years of hunting for this jerk and we finally  did it. it just shows that you can't hid from us. this is a great movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend that you do
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|FUN game for kids and adults.  My 10 and 12 year old boys love it.  They love collecting the rare fish and building their own reef.  The graphics are great.  I even have FUN playing it and visiting my son's reefs.
B0009HAHD4|5.0|Replaced a lost one on the camera which kept falling off. This one snaps into place. Nikon should have used these instead of the rubber ones that came on the camera.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Good game financial pace is great. Still cookie cutter, even forcing a twenty word minimum. I do love dragons though and this is another great way to enjoy a favorite!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I read... A LOT!!! This book was a definite winner. Finally a strong woman who doesn't give in after a charming smile... A book written from the male perspective was BRILLIANT and literally had me laughing out loud.  I laughed so much my husband made me read pieces to him and he laughed as well.<br /><br />Sarcasm ... Check<br />Wit..... Check<br />Great plot .... Check<br /><br />Loved this book. I rarely do reviews because I feel after a while these books are all the same and my reviews would be a simple cut and copy.  This book was in a league of its own.<br /><br />My only complaint.... No epilogue! I'm a sucker for a wrapped up ending that has a fairytale finish.  Hey, that's just me!<br /><br />Great book!!!!!! Thanks Ms. Chase!! Look forward to more!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved it! I couldn't put it down. I read it in 2 days Rick Riordan has done a very good job I started the first book and finished the last book in 3weeks or less. so READ IT!!
B00BY7NK96|5.0|I honestly didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. Despite the positive reviews from friends, I was concerned that I was playing into hype.<br /><br />This should be required reading for everyone. Most people are too scared to talk about gender imbalances in the workplace, especially considering how far women have progressed. She brings up the practical issues that people are too scared to discuss and talks with brutal honesty about how gender affects how you are perceived.<br /><br />I hadn't thought about a lot of the issues she discussed. I really hope this leads to an honest discussion and leads to people challenging certain attitudes (from both genders) in the workplace.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a cool book way worth ur money and all rick riordan`s amazing examples of what books should be should be shared with the world
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great games and everyday I play. The character I like the most that I have unlocked is lucy.(I like her hair to.)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game, but the thing that bugs me is that sometimes, the hind legs, at the ankle, it's bent too far to be normal. If they'd fix that, I'd give it a full 5 stars.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This app is great! I love mixing songs. And now my friends and  I can have a remix night! Woot woot.
0425263908|5.0|If you haven't already bought it, then, what are you waiting for? The story line is amazing. Personally, I think it's way better than the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. The romance feels raw and true. It almost makes you jealous of not having your own personal Gideon Cross!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is in my top 5 favorite games. Anything that you think of, and if you want to clear out the level just type flood and release it on the world. This is a game that if you looking through your device and you find this it's one of those play it sort of thing. I hope my review helped you to find a great game to play.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved everything about this book and am so glad it didn't end being a trilogy!  Gideon and Eve's journey is real and raw and the love and the struggles they share come across beautifully on the page. No one is an island and the books have shown how both characters are influenced by those around them and how the decisions you make influence your life in ways you can't predict.  I love how the struggles they face aren't tearing them apart in this book and how they talked to each other honestly about all of the outside influences trying to destroy them.  The emotions and sexual encounters they share are scorching hot and I can't wait for more in the next books.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is now one of my favorite games it's complete awesomeness nice job whoever created this amazing and awesome app!!!
B00A7W29BE|5.0|This a great addition to my growing collection of Android utilities.  Easy to use and the interface lets you easily send the scan to your cloud account..  Nothing not to like!
B000L3CHC0|5.0|Very good value, classic watch and for first week has kept time within 1 second.  Could improve luminosity of watch for being able to tell time in dark.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|This is a pretty good one as well. I haven't played it enough to get the full experience of the game. From what I have played it is nicely done. Good graphics and sound effect are good too.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love some of our local weathercasters, but none of them - even Tom Skilling - has an app to deliver really current weather info.  This one does.  Tom may change it (the Weather Channel cannot compete with his Chicago weather generally) but for now this is it!
B008N1V11U|4.0|This is a pretty good game. I like the different aspects that you are put in which is basically the different aspects of the movie. The only thing that I think would help is the fact that you have to get these coins in order to get upgrades and you either have to beat up a lot of guys to get some coins. I haven't figured out how to get more in a shorter period of time. Otherwise, Graphics are good and the sound effects are good. I got this for only 99 cents.
B007XC9BSK|5.0|i recomended it because really works. Now our son put all his mocro cars at the same place. very good product
0385342055|3.0|The book arrived in wonderful condition.  I have to admit that it took longer to arrive that I thought it was going to take.  I just could not get into this story.  I was amazed because I had so enjoyed the &#34;Twenties Girl&#34;.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I could totally relate to Elizabeth Banks' character's experience!  Good movie, something a couple who has been through childbirth/parenting could watch together and enjoy.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|The product arrived in excellent condition and very quickly.  The movie.....well that was not as excellent.  You would be wise to save your $ for something else.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This puzzle game was very well done. It was not incredibly difficult but did require some thought. I completely recommend this. I will buy the next one. The only suggestion I have is to make it longer.
0425263924|3.0|It kills me to give one of Sylvia Day's books anything less than four stars because she so often gets it so right with her characters and their development throughout the story. That's why I was so baffled by the choice here to prolong unnecessary drama between Gideon and Eva rather than making headway on resolving very real issues between them. The whole storyline with Brett tempting Eva sexually honestly felt like a rather cheap ploy to distract from the more important issue at hand which was the need between Gideon and Eva to work with each other on being more honest and trusting to establish a much healthier relationship. I didn't really mind checking in with different characters, but again, it came slightly across as a way to fill time before getting to the end of the book. I wouldn't mind the unfinished ending so much if it felt justified, but the only thing it felt like was a cheat to the readers to prolong the series. The actual writing within the story is well done as usual with the expected steamy encounters. However, I would have enjoyed that all so much more if the romance made the real strides here that I was hoping to see. I'll still read the last book of the series to see the real conclusion of this relationship. I only wish I had been given the chance to see that happy ending here.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|i really enjoyed  this book. great story characters really made me laugh. i did not enjoy the ending. its gross. i wont spoil it but eww. i hope it fixes it self out in the other books but im really disgusted  right now . lol. but i will be reading all of them.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Really fun and addictive game.  My better half told me about it. Now we both play.  You have to try this game!
B0010SEMP0|3.0|It was better than the first one, though the beginning seemed to jump around a lot. Cat still refused to seek pertinent information before jumping into action, thereby stupidly endangering herself. That always drives me nuts. But I really liked Bones' almost obsessive desire to give her anything she wants or needs. I thought that the sex scenes weren't very good, if I'm honest. Too over the top, but not descriptive enough. But I appreciated that Cat finally had a support system and friends around her.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I like Jeremy Renner, but not as much as Matt Damon. It was entertaining, but the series has lost some steam.
0545123267|4.0|This is an eery, poignant read. It feels like something M. Night Shyamalan would have a hand in, minus the horror. But, like the almost missable wolf on the cover, you feel the odd camera angles and barely perceptible background music that incites the reader to feel overlooked. It gives the book a real sense of atmosphere.<br /><br />The writing is absolutely beautiful. One of the character likes to compose songs and the whole thing reads a little like his lyrics. It's pretty and it flows well, but I have to admit that after a while it wore on me a little bit. I think purple prose is the correct term to use here. Everything is over described, flowery to the umpteenth degree. Again, it's beautiful, but I could have done with a few hundred less similes. No one just walked into a room. They walked into a room like an avenging angel, or soft winter wind, or rolling thunder. I'm making these up, but you get the point.<br /><br />The two main characters are generally likeable--Sam especially. It would be hard not to like someone as gentle (and fragile) as he is. He is well complimented by Grace and together they feel fated. I would have really liked to get to know the rest of the pack better. You get almost nothing of them in this book. I expect they play a bigger role in future books though.<br /><br />All in all I'm glad to have read it. I probably would have let it linger on the shelf forever if it hadn't been group read. I'm glad it got bumped up. As an aside, I rather liked the subtle blue ink of the text that matched the cover so well. A fun detail.
B003SHUMRI|4.0|I had been meaning to watch this for some time and finally got around to it. It was a fun movie
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This book fills in a lot of questions and gaps for before, but because of the nature of what it does, it can be a bit boring. However, this is not a bad read and really feels like it was needed as a slow down and change up in the story was the next logical step before pacing up for another climax. Otherwise everything would happen too quickly without enough story telling to explain logically.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|This doesn't quite have the quality of the first three Lord of the Rings movies. It was entertaining, but very long.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Still love it but could I get wind compass back please. Live on beach &amp; it was super convenient when going back &amp; forth between different islands:)
B0090P98Z4|5.0|really good. how come there is no boss rush<br />its got good graphic and its got good enemies.I like the dragons layer best
0451418441|5.0|Set in the middle of the 14th century, World Without End is an engaging and intriguing story. Caris and Merthin manage to miss each other in the romance department, not once, but twice, and Merthin loses opportunities because of the manipulation of the devious Godwyn. Follett--who knew he could write a medieval tale--has done a good job of putting his reader into the machinations of his characters. If there is a weakness in this book it is the over-emphasis on the achievement of a surname via the person's work. It's a little heavy-handed.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a fun game and I like it and just don't play that much. If you like bingo this is deffently the game for you.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|I've had these headphones for about two years. I use them mainly for music production when it's too late at night to use the studio monitors. Why did I think of posting a review after two years? Well, I just spent some time trying out headphones at the store because my other over the ear headphones (Sony MDR-7506) have the cable broken. I use the Sonys for daily listening and TV shows, mostly because I love the bass on those. But since the cable broke down, I've been using the 702s for everything and let me tell you: though the bass on these is very light compared to every other high end headphone on the market, the tightness of it and the overall sound quality is amazing. Having compared these with many others just today, I can tell you that nothing is hyped on these. The stereo image is beautiful. I am listening to some minimal techno at the moment and am loving it. Other bass-heavy genres sound equally good. Classical music on these is unbelievable. I have a pet theory that there is a coke vs pepsi type effect here, where most people like the initial taste of better but the \\"whole can\\" pleasure of drinking coke is higher for the average person. Either way, my point is that the lighter bass is not a problem for me even though I like bass-heavy music.<br /><br />By the way, I am using a Nuforce Icon HDP digital to analog converter and headphone amplifier with these. I've read in many places that these headphones require a headphone amplifier because they require so much power. Well, even without the amplifier, both my iphone and macbook pro have no problem giving these more volume than I need.<br /><br />One negative point for these is the design of the leather band. My friends always tell me I have a big head and even though the headphones do cover my ears fully, the band puts too much pressure at the top of my head. I read all kinds of things online, with people cutting the bumps out the leather etc. (Hardly ideal for an expensive piece of gear.) In the end, I had to tape the leather band to the metal at the top of these headphones in order to be able to use them for more than an hour at a time. It's fine now, but watch out for this. I will give these 5-star anyway because of sound quality.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|Fast. Not very challenging. Good to kill time when commercials are on. But at least you can feel like a success.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is an amazing game it is very entertaining I could sit and play it for hours. My little sister's love it it is great for all ages. This is an amazing game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The only thing you need to watch out for is ALWAYS HAVE POTIONS. But other than that You should be fine
B0012DK4ZU|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. I love the old classic horror like this. I would highly recommend this to any horror fan.
0345803485|5.0|the book was very good not as ranchy as I thought very interesting I would recommond it to my friends
B00BEXB18M|1.0|Megadeth have lost their edge and seems to have devolved into the realms of commercial popular rock music. The majority of the songs are boring, mid-tempo snoozers and seem to be a continuation of the boring songwriting we witnessed for songs he wrote for 13. I've always loved Dave's vocals, but the vocals on this album are forced and have no edge or Mustaine snarl to them at all. The lyrics.. what can I say, this man used to write masterful lyrics, but not anymore. Judge for yourself. The only song that is decent to my ears is Dance in the Rain, but only because it has an aggressive part with an interesting effect on the vocal, while the verses and chorus are just plain mediocre. Overall, this album is a huge disappointment. Risk is a better album than this all the way around. Save you money.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is an amazing read!anyone looking for an entrancing and beautifully written book will look no further! I loved this book!
B007L6VR6M|1.0|QUIRKY. I like quirky movies(Raising Arizona, Hudsucker Proxy, Bringing Up Baby. etc.), but this seemed to put weirdness first and tried to build a story our of it. I had no sympathy for any of the characters and I tend to like counter culture characters (I lived through the 60's and worked in junior high schools for 30 years). This had 40 minutes of my time and that was as far as I could get.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Over all good game. I enjoy HO Adventure games and G5 seems to be on the right track. One improvement to G5 - after customer buys 4 or 5 games give them a WHOLE game free not just another trial version.
B00BCOQSSQ|2.0|I'm a sucker for a good young adult book, and I'm pretty easy to please. This book did not provide a pleasant or enjoyable reading experience. The plot might have been good, but I had a hard time focusing on it due to the distracting writing style, the oddly described or, in many cases, not described characters and settings, and a general lack of solid action. Fancy cover art, though.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Totally adicting. Even a grandma like me loves the challenge and scenery. Would love it if you could make a cool looking grandma J character or something for us old folks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter talked me into downloading this game and I have to admit that its addictive keeps u busy and helps pass time wherever u are.
0739319175|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Dan Brown did a great job as a follow up to the DaVinci Code. It's fast paced and hard to put down. The only thing that let me down was the very last couple lines in the book....I was just expecting something more.
B00CDV6WDS|2.0|When the tiles are shuffled there should be a way to win, not only able to make one move and then have to shuffle again.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is the best bluray set for collectors. It includes  interesting behind the scenes documentaries for all 3 movies and a cool artwork book.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|I didn't expect much from Dredd, but i was blown away at this movie. You don't have to know anything about the comic to understand wants going on  and keeping with the the intensity of the action and well paced. I recommend movie this for any sci fi fan, whether your familiar with Dredd or not.
0634049011|5.0|I have played guitar for the better part of a decade. I took panio lessons previously and then 2-3 years of guitar lessons. I leaned predominately TAB and little of the theory behind the music. this book is the perfect bridge for me! Recommended to a average level guitar player who really wants to step their game up!
B000002LAC|5.0|Had heard about this CD years ago and never purchased it. Am so glad that I did. All three have great voices and it is a great CD
B009KS4XRO|4.0|personally would love to see a \\" cap\\" on how many people in each room. would also love you to make it so that if you get a bingo it bingos for you..thereby cutting down the fighting about holders,  also can you make it a little easier to actually get a shadow? too many blank cards!  If you could make all the games so there would be a shadow every time that would be awesome! Also, I lose too many instant bingos! You should make it if you don't get a bingo using the instant daub then it should be put back in your inventory.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Fun game, great way to kill some time. Needs to build up the medals faster. So far it doesn't require me to spend real money to progress and that makes it a good game in my book.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Ok, I have been a fan of this Chinese tile game for years. But this game was the best form of the game I have played to date. It was challenging yet easy to manuver. I highly recommend this game to everyone!!!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Could not put it down.  Amazing. Need to understand more about the author. Extraordinary book. Left me breathless and horrified.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|This is a great album. Someone compared this to risk and world needs a hero this is way way better!
0307266303|1.0|This is an awkward writing piece powered by some ridiculous imagination. For any person who ran more or less competitively it sounds like amateurish fantasies.<br /><br />Leaving the running side alone, the author makes hokey jokes and displays very primitive writing method. For instance, going off for a couple of paragraphs to convey some very basic point and actually miss an opportunity for a good joke. Oh my god.<br /><br />I couldn't get past chapter 3 because of the tides of disgust.
