B00005JPCA|5|Splendid!  This movie harkens back to the Sean Connery Bonds.  Craig makes a dangerous and dark Bond.   The look, the eyes, it is all perfect.  I can fully overlook the blonde hair.   <br /> <br />The action sequences are very visceral and physical. The gadgets are very grounded and reasonable.  The story is simple and elegant.  One of the things I like about it is that, although they embellished it a great deal, the story stays true to the Ian Fleming original, and Ian Fleming would really like this Bond I think.   People who have not read the books WILL think this is a departure.  I think not.   <br /> <br />Two PPKs up for this Bond.  I look forward to this new re-invented Bond and I hope they keep it up.  Welcome home, Mr. Bond!
B007VUA7VO|5|its cool n u can change the color n h can put a voice to tell it when u want 2 charge it
031623480X|5|God put real dairy, real beef, wild game, seasonal veggies etc on earth for us humans to eat. Man has manipulated grains year after year for mass production. Caveman didn't sit around saying &#34;how can we grow this wheat differently to mass produce?&#34; Caveman ate what God put on the earth the way God put it on this earth during the season God felt it best to grow... Look around;  where food is eaten in its original God grown form there is not the disease and illness as in western culture. Thank you Dr. Perlmutter, people have thought I am crazy for years because I eat real butter, real beef and so on!!!!
B00LYHXFLY|4|Case was slightly cracked slightly, other than that it was perfect. My bf loved it :)
B00CSR2J9I|5|just keeps getting harder but keeps you interested. its for all ages and types. i think anyone could play this and just love it the same way my family and i do.
B0016LTNL4|5|British comedies are not for everyone, but for this movie is for anyone looking for a laugh.  I enjoy a good British comedy occasionally, so when I saw this movie I thought I would give it a shot.<br /><br />I expected the dry humor found in many British comedies, but was also pleasantly surprised to find a good deal of physical and situational comedy.<br /><br />The movie revolves around a family getting together to pay respects to the father of the two main characters. What ensues is complete madness.<br /><br />Death at a Funeral is definitely a gem and worth watching. Guaranteed laugh out loud funny.
B00AIQP9DE|3|Too short even for free. Took forever to download. It barely took up ten minutes of play for a 40 minute download.  Boo!
B00E8KLWB4|5|This is unlike any game I've played. It's pretty fun!
B0001VV1GK|5|I purchased this for my 2.75 year old for Christmas, and now at the end of February, it is still in the middle of the living room and has had multiple HOURS of play every single day since then for two solid months now.  He ADORES this thing.  It is extremely solidly built, his match box cars fit on it, he can do the elevator by himself, and he just loves it.  I can't rave enough about this toy.  I purchased a wooden train set that was his other gift at Christmas, and it has gotten hardly any play compared to this garage.
B00CTEP7O4|5|I had never watched this series and now I'm obsessed with it. Great show....well written and great cast. Lewis is just the right amount of creepy!
B00K05IHNC|5|One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!
6303593666|4|I`m writing from Germany, where the film is forbidden. Don`t blame Leni  Riefenstahl too much for this. According to her biography she was forced to  produce it by the Propagandaministerium. The film won silver and gold  medals in Italy and France even in 1937. The speeches of Goebbels, Hitler  and the others are about freedom, a free-press, work, the truth, a new  mysicism and a new future. Not one sentence about war, hate or racism. If  Hitler had this already in mind, really cynical and untrue. The guests from  other countries are treated with respect  and are mentioned in the  speeches.<br />One of the favorite films of Mick Jagger, for example. 300.000  people in the night with torches shaping a Hakenkreuz must be impressive  for anyone. The film is welldone by a famous moviemaker of those times  (just watch her first big success &quot;The blue light&quot; in 1932. But  as far as I know, Leni R. had no political interests and did it just  because she had to do it. But well. After the war she was blamed for it.  <br />Like &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; this film should be published again in  Germany for history lessons, to understand, how a whole nation was  manipulated with georgous rituals like that.  Fateful is the sequence where  Hitler is speaking to his youth, the youngsters faces expressing idealism  without bad thoughts  and worshipping this man, believing everything what  he was saying.  <br />Thomas
B009J2VQSK|2|Not as good as I thought it would be. The ending song as movie credits roll was not even on the soundtrack. There are only a couple of really good songs on the CD. I was disappointed.
B000HIVOI2|5|Has always been one of my favorites, but in Blu-ray, even more so.  A must for your Blu-ray collection.
B0073LWEXK|3|I absolutely loved the app until it stopped working on my kindle fire! And I was on the last level it really bugged me. I would've given it five stars if it kept working.
B003AYBC6E|5|My best recommendation!!!
1596177373|2|Only the face cards and jokers have pictures.  And even they are the same for each suit.  So there are a total of 6 unique pictures here (4 face cards + 2 jokers).  Very disappointing.  At least it was cheap.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I have flappy bird and I really like it but I do have flappy wing and I like them both. I think it's just really fun
B00QW8TYWO|5|My mom likes it
B00DR0PDNE|1|Chromecast is a terrible product that does NOT work the way it is advertised. Very frustrating to set up and only works with a couple apps. Great idea......horrible follow-thru.
0783240287|5|We play this movie over and over. My daughter has just discovered Joseph and I enjoy taking it in as much as I did long ago.
B00004XONN|5|Radiohead is not the only rock band putting out great music today (although one could argue they are) but they are the only rock band who is successfully moving the genre forward.<br />Thank God for them. <br />It's a great album with nothing lacking in songwriting. Except that stupid track 2.
B007UXTQAU|1|Worst Movie Ever
B0094LDZ9E|5|Even thought it is a kids movie and I am an adult I like lighthearted fun movies and this is just that. The singing and dancing is great you will love whether your a kid or in your late twenties like me.
B00003CXZ3|4|Memento is well made, if nothing else.  Taughtly written, well directed, well acted, and once you get used to the backwards storytelling, surprisingly easy to follow.  Hopefully it will give a much deserved boost to the careers of Guy Pearce, Carrie Anne Moss and Callum Keith Rennie (not that he really needs one, but I'll show a bit of patriotism anyway).<BR>Despite all its good qualities, and despite the fact that I'd like to go back and figure it out properly, from start to finish, I don't think I will.  The film is so relentlessly depressing, and disturbing that the ending, while clever, and satisfying on one level, brings its own sense of relief that you can get back to normal life.  You certainly don't want to know the characters afterwards.  However, this is probably an indication of how well the film establishes mood, and it's definately worth a watch, but I'm not sure I'd recommend buying it right away.
B005LAJ1H2|5|Excellent!
B00DJFIMW6|3|Cute game, but a little difficult to get past one point. It starts from the beginning each time, so you may eventually get bored seeing the same thing over and over. It takes a while to load back up each time you die too. Cute with good graphics, but it has room for improvement.
B0084I9QIW|3|My favorite album from Michael Jackson has always been BAD. The videos and the look were so cool to me. I've always considered it to be his best album. The title tracks video was actually my first memory of Michael Jackson.<br /><br />I've waited years and years to see this concert. I've signed petitions just to get this amazing concert on DVD or something so us unfortunate fans who weren't old enough to see it live could at least witness it. Our prayers were finally answered! September 18th, 2012.<br /><br />I prepared to spend at least $20 on the DVD if the price ever got that steep. Fortunately for me it didnt.<br /><br />To be honest I was kind of disappointed.<br /><br />Let me point out the good things about the concert before I point out the negatives.<br /><br />The Positive.<br /><br />Michael Jackson is spectacular. He's an amazing performer. His vocals are perfect and his dancing is top notch.<br />The set list is pretty great. Although the show doesn't really flow that well together, its still a great set list. He clearly was saving his best songs for the encore.<br /><br />The Negative.<br /><br />The quality is crappy. I understand that the this actually was formatted from a video tape but it's really terrible. It looks like a low quality YouTube video.<br />Its also presented in widescreen format which stretches the video. So it makes Michael look a little awkward. Like he's top heavy and then really small legs that are barely visible sometimes.<br />I kind of got bored. It was a great show but it didn't hold my attention for much longer.<br /><br />Overall I'm satisfied. I wanted more but..I'm satisfied. I don't know if I'm going to sell it or keep it for later viewing.
1476746583|4|This is a very fine book and most enjoyable to read.<br /><br />I have to say right off however, I cannot recall being so disappointed at an author's killing off of a character as when I read this book.<br /><br />Beautifully written with interesting technique of placing chapters going back and forth between time to keep you in suspense as to what will happen towards the end. The story concerns a young blind French girl and her loving father who is a locksmith at a natural history museum and a young German boy with a knack for electronics and radios and his younger sister who are orphans in the years just before and during WWII.<br /><br />Very well written; you won't be disappointed when you read this book, except only perhaps that all the characters do not make it to the end.
B00N0YJVGW|5|Wow. Thank you prince! This album is so amazing and just has so many pieces coming together from fuzzy guitar riffs and wailing solos that bring to mind black Sabbath covering Hendrix, loud hard drums, lush and layered female singing, funky rhythms, the classic prince catchiness,  a lot of different styles and vibes are going on through these 44ish minutes. And I decided to write this review to let someone else know, that this stuff is just awesome. I'm sure most of you know its kind of a sister album with art official age. The comparisons are inevitable so let me just state that these albums are so different that aside from such a pivotal fact as theyre both hyped new albums from the one and only prince, theyre basically as opposite as you can work within the very loose boundaries that prince has set for himself. This album is technically &#34;prince & 3rdeyegirl&#34; although 3rdeyegirl performs on his &#34;solo&#34; album. Confusing in a sense, but, in the past 30 years, who has confused audiences more than prince? This album presents the most modern incarnation of prince, as some kind of shamanistic funk rock guitar god that Hendrix and Santana would huddle together in fear of. To me, this is the best incarnation of my favorite artist of all time. I mean it, this music is that good. It rivals his 80s catalogue. This album is funky, catchy, heavy, psychedelic, funky, intelligent, funky, original, funky, and on top of that its kinda funky. I want to complain about the lack of screwdriver and lets go crazy reloaded, and the song boytrouble is kind of stupid, but the music on this album is just amazing. I recommend this to literally anyone and everyone.
B003BYX9SW|5|Still can't tell what was in this one that had been left out before, but it was great. Been too long since I have seen the original.
0316055433|3|I listened to the CD version.  It was not easy listening, especially the teenage part which was too long and drawn out.  the book would have benefitted from more editing. If I had been reading it I probably could have speed read some of it. But in listening I could not speed it up alas! Enjoyed her previous book much more than this one.
B0090P98Z4|5|This game is very very nice, I like the graphics. Nice actions and skills. Easy to play game. Must try this game and rate 5 stars
B004MC0FO8|5|Easy to use, many songs, albums, ratings by countries, tags, you can hear and/or buy the songs . I really enjoy this app
B00BP4VWRU|1|It was super boring and not funny at all. Maybe it's just be because I'm not super into British humor but it wasn't even dry-funny, it just plain wasn't funny.
B0086700CM|5|It is a great game. It would be cool if it had a game where you go in the temple and to trials for the idol too.<br />This is an awesome game!
B005544TRQ|5|Extremely well done!!!  The plots, cinematography, and characters are all top notch.  Way above average!!!
B00947N6UG|5|Rise of the Guardians is a beautiful movie for all ages.  The story line is terrific, it makes the children who are questioning who really are Santa, Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny believe all over again.  A lovely family movie, highly recommend
B003WUYRGI|5|Everything I was looking for was here. Fabulous. I needed a word for school, searched it up on my kindle, BOOM. THERE. THANK YOU
B001UGB1X8|5|Another great movie for Tommy Lee Jones. It has great suspense through out the hole movie. Has a great line up of cast's a lot of great movie star's in this. You will enjoy watching this good movie.
B008KOTNVA|1|Pentalobe Screwdriver broke after the very first attempt to unscrew the bottom of Mac Book Pro. It even looked cheap and unfinished (except the packaging).
B00AREIAI8|5|Is fun to help pass the time! Love to play when I'm trying to relax! Keep up the good work !
B00005LB9O|3|As a whole, this CD is adequate.  If you do not have a Travis album and are thinking of buying this because of 'Sing', consider their second ablum, &quot;The Man Who&quot; instead.  'Sing' is a fabulous song and it may be worth it to purchase this CD, however the fact is that the other songs are only tolerable.  Travis hasn't shown me much other than &quot;The Man Who&quot; (which I rate 4.5 stars) and have lost their place as one of the better Brit Pop bands.
B000QFAJ7S|5|Clarkson's third CD was deemed \\"controversial\\" by her record label and thought to be too dark and somber for commercial success. Well, while it may not be the type of record that easily pushes songs onto the Billboard Top 40, it is a very, very good showcase for Clarkson's voice and developing skills as a songwriter.  I admire Clarkson for placing her artistic vision and integrity ahead of sales, and feel that over time, music fans and critics alike will simply listen to the music, and her vocals, and consider this album nothing short of a success.  My favorite moments on this CD are those where she is stretching to find her musical direction, in cuts like Never Again, Sober, Maybe, Irvine and in the excellent hidden gem, Chivas.  While this CD may not appeal to the masses who are fed their music through Top 40 radio airplay, it reminds me more of the rock-oriented CD's of the 70's and 80's that yielded few (if any)hit singles.  Clarkson may lose a bit of her American Idol and Breakaway audience with this CD, but in return she will gain the respect of those who like their music more honest and personal.  This is an excellent CD,and it becomes even moreso with additional spins.  Clarkson's voice is   amazing, conveying nuance and emotion when needed, and hitting the highs that set her apart from all the other female contemporaries.  She is a true talent.  Buy this record!
B0070Y46UY|5|A most amazing book that leads the reader on a spectacular journey. The main character is a boy to instantly fall in love with. The end of this book is both joyful and sad because it's as though you've lost a friend
B003O86FMW|4|Hard to put down. Looking forward to the next one.  Good story telling. Kept me thinking when not reading the story.
B00AC8ZA3M|4|Provides good connection between the Halo Mythos and Halo 4, but lacks some of the big budget wow factor.  4/5* for good acting, just wish they had gotten Chief's voice actor for the miniseries as well.  Gives good hope for a Halo movie down the road.
B00CTEP7O4|5|Keeps you wanting more. Fun to watch very refreshing. The characters have great chemistry . The stories have twists and turns that are unexpected .
B007FG9LIE|4|It held your interest and did not let on the outcome. Very suspenseful thru the whole book. Can't wait for the next one.
B00HDMMISA|5|I enjoyed this novel from start to finish. I highly recommend this book. I enjoy all of the authors books.
B004XDYJRU|1|Been using this for a couple years. The 10 sec rewind and record function are nice. But...exiting is sometimes a hassle (should be able to exit application from any screen and not have to back out to home screen first).  And worst of all...it very often turns on without you knowing. Eating my data allowance.<br /><br />If the one station I listen to was on another app I'd dump this one.
1780674880|5|I have two copies of The Secret Garden and have enjoyed every minute with them.  I am so excited and happy to receive the Enchanted Garden.  I preordered this book and looked forward to getting it.  The pages are beautifully illustrated.
B000002WPI|5|This CD is awesome.  It has a sound that has not ever been reproduced on all the solo projects that followed it.  It sounds more simple.  There rough tag team style is addicting.  RZA'a production is so sparse but at  his all time high at the same time.  The hole thing is just incredible from  top to bottom.
B004X80QNG|4|Like everyone else has said, this desperately needs a widget. It also needs an in-program way to force a sync with the google server so that you don't have to go to another app. One o other glitch is that the name of the program in the app list is &quot;Informant&quot; not &quot;Pocket Informant,&quot; making it hard to find.  But it accomplishes one thing that Business Calendar and Jorte fall short, which is creating events that do not appear as tentative in Outlook. This is huge. I also like the various layout opinions available. Hopefully they will implement a widget feature soon so that Pocket Informant can take over from Business Calendar (which I use, but do not enjoy) on my home screen.
B008Q00BOQ|5|One of my favorites with Tom and I don't especially like him all that much. Suspenseful and great plot. Good movie
B00000ADG2|1|I don't understand what all the excitement is about this album. I found it an absolute waste of time and money. Lauryn Hill has a beautiful voice but she wastes it by rapping. I found maybe two songs that were worth it, but  the rest was disappointing and in fact irritating. Two thumbs down, and you  should think twice about buying this album, because it will find your junk  drawer as a cozy home.
B004EPYZTE|2|Ok, here's some perspective on where I come from with this whole Conan thing. The 1982 film has a special place in my heart. Always has and always will. It's slow and artsy, also powerful. Growing up a young angry man, Arnold's Conan helped mold my character. I'm not joking, I loved that movie. The Destroyer was bad. Familiar faces were nice but it was ultimately a joke. I had read some paperbacks-none of the original works so my understanding of the source material is limited. But the original movie you could tell was made with so much love and dedication, it was a beautiful film. The revenge story, the evolution from a boy to a man, it was all so inspiring to me as a kid. When the new movie was announced I was reserved in my excitement, although my inner child was screaming with anticipation. This was despite the consistent warnings of childhood friends who panned the new re-imagining as a cash grab. I waited, heard some awful reviews, but then again the original had some bad reviews as well. Then I saw the Conan O'brian interview with the lead (momoa)and thought to myself what a likable chap. And he kind of looks like REH's Conan to boot. The other day I almost bought the blue-ray at Target but fortunately passed on it. I ended up ordering it ondemand. All I can say is I'm glad I didn't buy it. It's sooo bad. The birth of Conan on the battlefield was so unintentionally funny, I actually can say that it was my favorite part of the movie but for the wrong reasons. The rest was forgettable and I fell asleep before the end. It's like an episode of Xena on roids. Shame. The lead wasn't bad, but he wasn't good enough to save this hunk of crap movie. I think I'll be buying the original on blue-ray, my respect for that movie has been resurrected.
B005CM9DX6|4|While not quite a sequel to \\"Damnation\\" (which I loved) it leaves behind the horrid \\"Cookie Monster\\" vocals of prior albums in favor of ...singing.  Yes, Akerfeldt can actually sing, and now we finally have an Opeth album full of songs, which is the logical next step in the progression which Watershed continued.    Having said that, it took me a few listens for the album to grow on me; my initial reaction was that the album was uneven and sketchy.  Now that it's sunk its roots into me, I'll be listening to it at least as often as any other Opeth album (except for Damnation, which remains my favorite).
B007L3BMGA|1|I had heard about this book from many people encouraging me to read it.  I'm sorry but I just don't get it!  the book is disappointing on so many levels. The content is bland and predictable and I found myself speed reading after the first chapter!<br />It had no real content to 'Get into\\"  the characters were lifeless and quite frankly boring. the idea of pretty people immensely wealthy smacks of teenage comic scripts.  The sex,  well frankly, get a life, even that was portrayed in a bland manner and was distinctly unexciting.  Sorry,  I gave it 1 star because that was the lowest I could click.
B00004RFCM|5|This is a classic season.  It brings you back to the begining and lets you remember all the basics of the characters.  It is fun to to watch and see them progress throught out all of the seasons.  Anyone who is a Sex and the City fan, I definitely reccomend getting the first season. It is a must have!
B000FC10IO|5|An amazing ending to this series. I am a little sad that the series wasn't longer.
B00CKOYVG8|5|I've always loved the challenge of Angry Birds, and now, with Angry Birds Friends, I can compete with my Facebook friends, which adds another level of challenge to the mix :)
B00MO21WAY|5|Downtown Abbey is one of the best if not the best shows I have ever watched.<br />I'm sorry to hear it is going to end with season 6.
B00DM12ANO|4|Watch this one with some one you care about. Some what of a chick flick, we thoroughly enjoyed it. Science fiction, some action--Things ended on a good note.
B003H6KRIE|5|good
0446572993|1|Third party seller again sends me a Book Club or Book of the Month book verses the full publisher copy that I expected.  Threw the book in the recycling bag.  Don't want my money back.  I enjoy reading and look forward to getting the book I ordered.  I only read the publisher versions that are full size, full weight, have the standard font size, and good quality paper. I'm real tired of Amazon supporting companies that are either despicable and greedy, or just don't know what they are doing.  Amazon has shown no interest in fixing this issue, and I've started going to Barnes and Noble for books.I may pay  little more but I'll be assured that I'll receive the book I ordered and not a cheap imitation.  All Amazon has to do is require their 3rd party Seller to list Book CLub or Book of the Month Club books as such in the description of the item on the sale page.  Simple - just do it!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|It is an all round great game for all ages and for any body looking for a great game to play
B005SFR7YE|4|Gave it to my wife and she loved it.
B001C08RHA|4|Bought this for my son (18).  He thoroughly enjoyed the action and technology.  I found the scenery to be a bit dark.  Overall, a pretty good movie for the price.
B000069KGM|4|Chicago's self-titled debut album (under the moniker of Chicago Transit Authority) was a bold record upon its initial release.  First the original release was a double album which were becoming popular at the time, but for established artists like The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix.  Second, the band combined jazz elements into their music, which no other group other than Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears was doing at the time.  The album has an experimental feel with the feedback laden \\"Free Form Guitar\\" and the rolling cover of Spencer Davis Group's \\"I'm A Man\\" show as well as the recordings of the infamous 1968 Democratic Convention that occurred in their namesake hometown that are on the record.  But most of the entire album shows the band's strong sense of melody and the first rate music they could make.  \\"Beginnings\\" is an absolutely beautiful ballad that stretches out over seven minutes thanks to a left turn into samba territory.  \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" is an almost perfect pop record that became the band's first top ten single.  \\"Questions 67 &amp; 68\\" shows the band's rock side to equally strong results.  Chicago Transit Authority shows that the band was more than just the corporate rock machine that it would become in the 1970's.  It shows the band had high ambitions as to melding rock, jazz and pop together.  They didn't always succeed, but at least they were willing to try.
B002ZG98C8|1|This is possibly one of the worst movies made. It's easily one of the worst that I've seen. It's simply awful.
B000E1ZBGS|5|I found this the best Jane Austen movie I've ever seen.  How Keira Knightley didn't win the best actress for her peformance is incomprehensible.  The music is wonderful throughout.  Naturally, liberties have to be taken in shortening a book of that length to a two-hour movie, but as I read through the book, I'm amazed at what a wonderful job the screenwriters did in getting so much of the original dialogue into the movie.  They also kept the spirit of hte story throughout.  It's absolutely delightful!
B003UYUQZW|5|I purchased this dvd and they were very prompt and helpful with the whole process of purchasing of the dvd and others.
B008602KQI|3|I was disappointed with this movie, after reading the book this movie just doesn't compare. The director truly lacked imagination in the making of  this film.
B00LXLM05I|5|I'm not a big fan of dungeon crawling but this game has its own uniqueness that is worth checking out.

B000T457ZU|5|There are variable, decisions and issues that confront humans all the time, then there are no immediate answers. Simple assignments? There are none. One guy said, &#34;I like to be the only one on the team....then there will be no mess up.
0525478817|5|The Best Book Ever‼️‼️‼️
B008Y212PI|4|Really fun game.  I've been addicted to it since downloading.  I like how there are easy puzzles and get harder.  All levels are the same, just different grids (5x5 to 15x15).
B0039Q7QKE|5|Amazing detail! My dad added it to his showcase! Fast shipping as well!

B004GJDQT8|5|More than satisfied!
B00DR0PDNE|5|Great product this should just come with every TV
B0055SWM08|5|super cool game. takes a bit to figure it out but once you get it, it's a great, challenging  game.
B000065V42|5|I had this movie on vhs before and it is a good, funny movie that you can watch over and over again.
B00KQFXODY|4|I liked this better than the first one.  Good cast.  Good effects of course.  If you like action...watch it

B00280LYHS|5|Written by Aaron.I was just reading through the reviews and I noticed that some of the reviewers said that this series was A RIP OFF OF HARRY POTTER! Can you beleive the nerve? The cheek? The audacity? First of all, this series has nothing to do with magic, and secondly, percy is NOTHING like harry potter. Any ways, it was a good book, to bad that it had to end. But it had to follow the traditoin of &#34;all good things must die young&#34; Also, did you know that you can pre order his new series called The Kane Chronicles? It's about egyptian mythology7 wich I think is cool because egyptian mythology is always overlooked. Actually I think it's the first notable book about egyptian mythology. ( Besides children of the lamp, but I found that book extremely boring.)
B0017U7PT6|4|This is a very good caveman movie with good action, pretty decent acting, and great special effects.

6302800420|3|This movie is a good one for those rainy Saturday nights when you have nothing to do and can curl up with someone you love and have a few good  laughs.  I must be honest, I am not generally a Dustin Hoffman fan, but if  I had to say, I'd rate this movie as one of his best.  It raises an  interesting question, &quot;What does a guy do who's down on his luck, does  something desperate and, afterwards, when common sense reigns again, he  finds that he can't back out of the choice he has made without ruining his  life?&quot;  This is basically the idea behind this movie, and Hoffman does  an incredible job as the nervous, slightly overbearing, not-so-slightly  arrogant theater teacher who is forced into an unbelievable set of  circumstances as a result of his rather unorthodox method of finding work.   There is some absolutely priceless interplay between the characters here.   This movie really makes one wonder what one values in a relationship --  platonic or otherwise. Have I intrigued you enough?  Final analysis: Like I  said, this is one of Hoffman's best, and a great suggestion if you wanted  to rent a comedy over the weekend, but unless you enjoy some very  fast-paced, sitcom-like humor in your movies, this is not one to see twice.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I am so happy the author ended the trilogy with this book.  As good a conclusion as you can hope for and more!

B00NEJ7MMI|5|New found holiday favorite
B00E8KLWB4|5|Really sweet. Have patience and pass the time with nice graphics and a challenging game. No need to spend money or friend anyone.
B008JEJO88|5|I bought these because I was going to be going to a theme park.  I enjoy the way they feel, however like all Crocs they make my feet sweat so I usually wear low cut socks in them.  Overall though they were a good buy and great for quick errands or slipping them on to take out the garbage
0380778556|5|On the edge of my seat excitement and suspense; thrilling and surprise ending.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Loved it !
B0097EWK3A|5|A little more complicated than the other big fish games.  Actually scared me a few times too!  Good stuff, worth the small fee.
1423113497|5|My son is 9 and is in 4th grade. This year he has to read daily for at least 30 minutes and write a summary.  He always wanted to read just 15 mins instead of 30. It was a challenge because since he didn't like reading at all, he was having a hard time to write the summary, he was not focusing. I got him this set of books and he loves them.  He even read ON A SATURDAY four chapters.  I was shocked. He remembers all the characters' names, what is going on, and the reading log is so good that his teacher gave one example of a great job, and she used his work to show the class.  I still remember his smile when he told me.  He was so proud of his effort.....and so I am.  Thanks Rick Riordan for such a great work!!!!
B00FJ3CK2Y|4|Not nearly as good as his Hundred Year Old Man ..... its plot is fairly predictable, the characters are cartoonish.
B00CO6QGCE|5|It is a great app
B004XJRQUQ|5|This book, aptly titled, kept me hungry for more everytime I put it down! Loved it and look forward to reading it again in a few months. Its definately re-read worthy!

B008XG1X18|5|I really enjoy looking thru all the things on Pinterest and picking out those things that are really interesting to me.
0385335482|4|I was offered this book by my wife on our holidays after I ran out of books to read.<br />To say this is not an epic novel is putting it mildly, but the story line made it impossible to put down and I devoured the book in one day.<br />A humourous look into the life of a nonstop shopping machine, I think we can all releate to the main character whether we are her, or know people like her.<br />The plot reads like waves on the ocean, as we follow the lead characters shopping sprees, and financial troubles rise and falter as she tries to juggle her persoanl life as badly as her check book.<br />A fun fast read that is sure to please
B00F91G5BS|3|Very predictable and not all that scary.  Foreshadowing was actually fore-giving-away.  I would not really recommend it unless you are really super into zombies.
B004V9MU86|5|The Book Thief is a memorable book. The layout of the text is dramatic. The narrative is intense and the written form of conversations exquisitely presents the spoken word. The story is deeply moving and an interesting presentation of the profound effects of war on civilian community life. A clumsy film presentation does the novel a great disservice. This is an essential read for people of all ages to experience the pain of war and prejudice..
B000AMZ20G|5|Apart from Amazon being a great Online retailer, they have dropped the ball when it comes to accuracy in CD Label/Version detail and UPC identification. Case-In-Point: I have attempted to enlighten Amazon by submitting description updates only to find them rejected. At one time, a dispute over whether the item was New Remastered; I pointed out as proof that the printing on the CD in question itself said \\"Digitally Remastered\\" and that Amazon of Canada, listed it as such. But the description update request still was rejected.<br /><br />For all who are wondering what happen to the K2 HD remastered 35th Anniversary reissues of ELP, this CD (Amazon, ASIN: B000AMZ20G) is the UPC:4988002489893 for Trilogy; K2-HD, 35th Anniversary Remaster, Japan-Victor 9/28/2005<br /><br />I consider the Limited Edition, K2-HD 24bit Digital Remaster's to be one of the best series to date.<br /><br />Why so many versions? The answer isn't that Keith Emerson, Lake and Palmer (or others) are out to build a massive retirement fund. Technology has vastly improved and the quest for that perfect remastered reissue prevails. Sometimes, a remastering house project may fall short of expectations and the artist may need to shop around again for a better manufacturer for his work. Sometimes it involves record label contracts and the need to wait-out the contract in order to get it remastered by someone else.<br /><br />Either way, the effort of most to remaster ones life's work is more about quality, not quantity.<br /><br />See Album Details at: amazon.ca (and) amazon.co.jp<br />UPC Database Lookup: [...]
B00EDOS6IC|5|Good tunes. Love.
B005HSG3TC|2|I bought this for my new Fire and was disappointed with the way the stand works. It only works for the landscape view, which is a problem for applications that won't shift from portrait. Also, the little groove where the top catches to hold it up is very narrow and would easily slip out, letting the Fire drop back onto the table. I used it for a couple of days and decided to return it for a cover that is a little more sturdy.
B009UX2YAC|5|My kids love this game.  It works great on the Kindle.  This is a must have if you have kids and want to keep them quiet while waiting for a doctors appt.  :o)
B001VPJZFE|5|I love this movie. It is different and clean enough for my kids to watch. I would definitely recommend it.
B000XUBFE2|2|It is very difficult to understand and not  an enjoyable read.  I am not finished with the book so maybe I will feel different when I am.
B005IQZB14|5|Loved the detail, loved her courage and the reason for the walk.  With each step she became a stronger hiker, daughter and woman.
B00JBGWP3Y|1|This movie completely made no sense.  First it didn't respect the story at all.  At one point in the film Noah fusses with his son for picking a flower BUT by the end of the film Noah is ready and willing to kill his grandkids.  The wardrobe in the movie was a joke.  It was very fashionable and looked like clothes bought off the rack and roughed up a bit.  These people were dressed pretty nice for it being the days before Jesus.  This was an environmental propaganda mess.  It was a combination of The Shining/Lord of the Rings.  Even Russell Crowe and my long time crush Jennifer Connelly couldn't save this movie.
B00HBQWGXK|3|I have read all of the Reacher series and this was not my favorite.  That said it was entertaining and a quick read.

B000V8I2QU|1|Bruce is an amazing legend, and that will never be taken away from him.    This album is mind-bogglingly lackluster, even when he tries to be wise and passionate. *Every* track gives the listener the sense that he really didn't want to roll out of bed to make it to the studio.    I'm a little bit stunned, because he is the greatest, and I was expecting some \\"age\\" to show on this effort, but not an utter lack of committment.    And he had to go ahead and call this album \\"Magic.\\"    Aye-yi-yi. It could use some magic. (But I still think he's the best \\"live\\" performer on the globe).    What were you thinking, Boss?
B00005A46T|1|I like some of Slipknot's work, particularly Volume 3 and .5 the Gray Chapter (the latter being their absolute best by far).<br /><br />Iowa deserves no caveats. Because it is by design meant to incite strong feelings of anger and resentment, playing out like a carnival ride through the depths of hell. Everything about this album is crap. From the hateful, nasty filled lyrics to the one dimensional pounding of repetitious riffs. It's like a workout album, if you consider working out chopping up your ex-lover's body. If someone wanted to create a Columbine boy band, this is what it would sound like. What a waste of time.
034554398X|3|I can't argue that GRRM is a genius at creating a story--from what appears to be endless angles. And the first three books of this series were captivating. But I won't be buying any more of the books, and I really caution others to carefully consider getting into the books of this series at all. Although GRRM knows how to spin a yarn, he doesn't know how to bring closure to it. These books and the tales of their characters go on and on and on, many with one bad thing after another happening to the most loved characters.<br />But wait, just when you think a character has finally escaped the wringer of their storyline via death, he/she often is reanimated somewhere, somehow--that is all except our beloved Ned of Winterfell, may he rest in peace.<br />Speaking for myself, as I said, I'm done with the books. I'll wait for HBO to fill me in (love the way Tyrion is being played!). And besides, I only have to wait a year for the next installment...not six as the readers had to wait for the last book in the series--that was supposed to be the last of the series, but as I said, GRRM seems to have resolution issues.

1401232590|5|This is one of those series (compilation in this case) that is tailor made for Batman fans and it's fantastic.<br /><br />It's not one of those things like Watchmen or Marvels or TDKR that I would heartily recommend to those not usually reading comics, but that's not a critique.  A story like this is made for Batman fans.  It's made for folks who understand the various signatures and personalities of the suspects involved.  It's a mystery.  It invites to actually try and solve the mystery.  There's a special brotherhood for fans in being able to point to a clue and then suspect some rogue or another then seeing where that clue takes Batman in the story...and being in his same mindset...until the next clue.<br /><br />And when I say mystery, I mean it.  It's a noir mystery.  Tim Sale is the perfect artist for a piece like this.  His style is both dark and animated all at the same time.  I think I first saw his stuff in LOTDK way back when and have tried to follow his stuff ever since.  So, not only will the story blow your socks off, but the art will as well.
B0007KS7D0|5|While ideal for most point-n-shoots, this clip-on lens is mind-blowing with a dSLR IF (and it's a BIG *IF*) your lens will be able to \\"see through\\" the 43mm glass elements of the Raynox.  That's right - the actual thread size of the glass element holder is only 43mm.  I'm sure that's part of what makes it affordable for the average photographer!  However, to make that work with my dSLR it means NOT using a wide-angle lens, and with my normal or telephoto lens stopping down to f/8 or f/11 or even f/16.  You can see a lot of other sample images of what these Raynox lenses do by doing an image search with the DCR-150 search word.  It's also worth noting that Flickr has several groups that are dedicated to photos taken with these close-up accessories.
B00GRPD0J0|1|Does not work for me.  Removed.
0767805712|1|Gattaca has a fascinating premise, but lousy execution, because the director forgot the single most important precept of movie-making: the audience must have an emotional relationship with the protagonist.  There are no likable characters in this movie.  Not a one.  Sure, both Ethan and Uma are fantastic LOOKING, but that's the point of genetic selection anyhow.  Their choices, their lives, their whining about the limitations on their priviledged life... none of it speaks to an actual human.<br />Brazil did it better.
B000070WJE|1|Yeppers give it a rest Robbie, their is nothing worse<BR>than a man, trying to act and sing like a 14 year old.<BR>The music on this album will take your breath away because<BR>its so bad.

6302878527|5|at first, i didn't really get this film(you have to pay attention to the plot,not just at audrey!) but after countless viewings, i have to say it's one of audrey's best films. it's not as glossy as charade and funny face but everyone looks really hip and the film is very sixties, especially the scene on the riviera when albert finney picks up a faye dunaway-esque blonde in a sportscar. the film is also very funny and the supporting roles are excellent.

0743298020|5|In this marvelous novel, Setterfield evokes the flavor of 19th century literature with a twisting tale of mystery and secrets written in a style reminiscent of Dickens or Henry.  The narrator is Margaret Lea, the spinster daughter of a London bookseller who devotes her time and energy to the books that she loves so much.  Margaret who writes biographies is summoned to the side of the great and popular Vida Winter.  The charismatic and mysterious author has spent a lifetime evading personal revelations by offering up dubious tales of her childhood and her history.  But now that Ms. Winter is dying she is finally ready to reveal her true origins and she has selected Margaret to assume the task of writing Vida's biography.  For Vida's birth and childhood are tales of mental instability, unnatural family relations and despair involving the once prominent family of a rural village.  As Vida slowly unfurls her story, Margaret is fascinated by the parallels to the secret of her own birth which involved a conjoined twin who died when she was separated from Margaret's side.  \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is more than a novel, it is a valentine to reading.  To Margaret, books are more important than people.  \\"As one tends the graves of the dead, so I tend the books.  I clean them, do minor repairs, keep them in good order. \\" Although the story is supposedly set in contemporary times, there are no cell phones, no computers.  Margaret's research into the truth of Vida's stories is done in dusty libraries with census books and  other enduring records.  It is a spell-binding story, filled with fascinating and tragic characters.

B002OSXDAU|5|Ayn Rand is, to put it bluntly, a genius. While many disagree with her philosophy, which centers around the virtues of being as society would call “selfish,” it is difficult to deny that she portrays that philosophy extremely well in this novel. Howard Rourke, Rand’s protagonist and the “fountainhead” of her belief system, does not hate other people. He does not think of others enough to hate them. This also means that he genuinely does not care about what others think of him. Rourke is brilliantly portrayed as what Rand envisions as the ideal human being. This novel is not only a work of fiction, it is a philosophical declaration of independence.
B00VFTAXUC|4|It was a long movie, but had enough wow factor to be worth it. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

6303433766|5|I was deeply disturbed after viewing this film. Two girls meet, become best friends, then fall in love. But even then, their relationship goes deeper than love/homosexuality. It becomes so obsessive that Pauline is not complete without Juliet, nor is Juliet without Pauline. They are both apparently psychotic, as in one scene Pauline even admits that they are both &quot;stark, raving mad!&quot; But killing her mother to be with Juliet? Awful. She views her mother, like she views everyone else, like a pawn, a thing, not a person. The murder scene disturbed me extremely. You can imagine what sorts of emotions they were feeling. They wished they'd never started, but they know they can't leave the horrible deed unfinished. What drives them to keep going is their intense need for each other. But it doesn't turn out like they'd hoped or thought. The end is gloomy and upsetting. Warning: You may be disturbed to tears.
B008YRVW0I|3|I have this on my laptop and it is good. I don't like playing a demo unless it says it is.<br />Good point about all the fishdom games is that there is no IAP'S!<br />It is appropriate for all ages.<br /><br />Have fun!
B005KCTQSK|5|\\"Bright Lights\\" by Ellie Goulding is a mix of songs that touch on varied emotions of love. \\"Starry Eyed\\",\\"The Writer\\", \\"Lights\\", and \\"Home\\" are some of the peppy songs on this cd. I first became interested in Ellie Goulding when I first heard her song \\"Under The Sheets\\" on one of the other music compilations that I had.  \\"Under The Sheets\\" is also on this cd. This cd is definitely recommended if you like her \\"Lights\\" song and/or if you like synth-pop.
0743270754|5|As the author of Lincoln, Inc.: Selling the Sixteenth President in Contemporary America (Rowman Littlefield), I've read at least four-score and seven Lincoln biographies out of the roughly 18,000 books written on the Great Emancipator. But Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals ranks in my top five. There are some other biographies that offer more comprehensive details on Lincoln's life, and there are some that offer more complex analyses of his childhood, his political philosophy, his rhetoric, his moral compass, and his personal relationships. But to my mind, no other biography does a better job of bringing the context of Lincoln's presidency to life. The book offers intimate and memorable portraits of Lincoln's friends and \\"rivals,\\" helping the reader understand the particular traits that set Lincoln apart. The book is not without its flaws and limitations (which have been addressed by many professional historians), but in my opinion it is essential reading for anyone interested it better understanding Lincoln and his age.

B00006AW2L|4|I am the Stones Authority. Aftermath and Between The Buttons. Buy them together. That should be required. What an incredibly prolific period for the Stones and what great songs and albums - released within about 6 months of each other. \\"Paint It Black\\", \\"Lady Jane\\"  and  \\"Under My Thumb\\". Wow. Very cool. Then there are other great tracks like \\"Think\\", \\"Flight 505\\"  and \\"I Am Waiting\\".   At this point in a lot of band's careers they are starting to run a little thin on material, what is remarkable about this period and this work is that the Stones are actually just getting warmed up. A lot of band's would have been happy to point to such a period in their career as their high water mark. Again, the Stones were just warming up. Aftermath and Between the Buttons - two more examples of the depth and greatness of this band.
0385536828|4|Reviews of Ian McEwan's latest book, Sweet Tooth, are already posted, including many details of the book. I hope that I do not repeat too much of what has already been written. Having read  Saturday and Atonement by McEwan and loved both of these books, I read this new book, over these past days of Thanksgiving food preparation and visits of children,every moment when I did not have to do something practical immediately. So, the book is intriguing, full of \\"side stories,\\" (don't be fooled), and again, as in other of McEwan's books, a denounement at the end that makes me want to and need to reread the book asap.<br />One reason that the book is disturbing, and I suppose that this is a good part of the book, is its seductive qualities--the reader must keep on reading. But, in this book's twisted world, in which the motives for action and relationships are both extremely self-serving and also very believable, how can individuals find a reality that makes sense, that does not add to the chaos our world already offers and already is? Perhaps I am still, at my advanced age, still childish, still looking for some kind of knowable ending, in order to feel some controls within the chaos.<br />In actuality, the author's other books, Saturday and Atonement, were so tightly written that the reader could pronounce the themes of these books and follow the symbolisms of the books and closely relate the author's ideas to the world that is in the news each day. This new book is not so easily related to everyday events. I think that change in emphasis is an advance in McEwans' writing.<br />I leave, relunctantly, this review with this question: What is Sweet Touth, and is McEwan saying something about the workings of governmental functions in addition to telling tthe story of the people in the book? No, this is mainly a story about people and what we can do to each other, calling into question whether we have a \\"helpful\\" gene or are really extremely selfish, with society trying and not succeeding to make us truly willing to connect with other people.

0812550757|5|I have always thought it a little ironic that both &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Speaker&quot; both recieved the Hugo and Nebula Awards. To my mind, the only connection they have with science fiction is the fact that they take place in a time when interstellar travel is prevalent. The purpose of science fiction is to get people excited about the future of technology: to revive in our culture the scientific optimism that got us to the Moon. Neither of these books -- and I discuss them as a unit, even though they are so different, with such different scope -- comes anywhere close to that. &quot;Speaker&quot; especially, is a work that asks much deeper quesions about human nature than science can answer satisfactorily.<br />&quot;Speaker For The Dead&quot; is my candidate for Greatest Fiction Work of the Twentieth Century. I do not say this lightly, even though I have not read all of the fiction, even that labeled &quot;great literary fiction,&quot; that literary critics have canonized. &quot;Speaker&quot; transcends literary genres and prototypes. I doubt whether science fiction has ever been used to pose so many eternal questions. It is not simply a great novel: it is a work of philosophy couched in a story. This book may be fictional, but it is True! The events of Speaker may never actually happen, but the world Card has painted for us is no longer a painting, but has sprung up into a full-scale universe.<br />It is too bad that Card could not have limited himself to &quot;Speaker,&quot; instead of forcing himself to draw out the story into &quot;Xenocide,&quot; and then &quot;Children of the Mind.&quot; Neither of those two lives up to &quot;Speaker&quot;'s elegant simplicity and unavoidable probing questioning into the heart of every reader. These two are science fiction -- their worlds eminently don't work, and I'm not talking about the physics. His characters become stylized, form fitted; he is shaping the plot to find an ending, and finds he has to extend and distend it to make that ending satisfactory. I have a similar criticism of &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot;: they do not ask the profound questions that &quot;Ender's Game&quot; did; they stay on the plane of events.and distend it to make that ending satisfactory. I have a similar criticism of &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot;: they do not ask the profound questions that &quot;Ender's Game&quot; did; they stay on the plane of events.

B007FG9LIE|3|This is going to be a series soon on Fox.  I had seen the previews and it peaked my interest.  the book started off really well.  A Secret Service Agent and his partner go to Wayward Pines to find out what happened to 2 missing agents.  Ethan, the protagonist, wakes up in a hospital with no ID or phone from a car accident.  His wife in Seattle knows he is missing and thinks he is dead. No one believes Ethan's story and they all think he is crazy.  Something is very strange in the town.  The book kept me very interested and it was a real page turner till toward the end.  It got a little too out there for me.  When the real reason is revealed as to what the town is, you will be disappointed.
B00005JKCH|1|If The Green Goblin is so interested in who Spider-Man is, why doesn't he take off Spider-Man's mask when he is unconcious with him on the rooftop?  Possibly because he is stupid.  And very lame.  The only good thing about this movie is when Kirsten DUnst is wet.  Cause she's fiiiiiiiiine.
B007PT3QOQ|1|Just updated game and now getting go to app store. What's wrong, very enjoyable game and now it's ruined. HOW DO WE FIX THIS?
B005CRQ4GU|5|This book was very good I read the first pages and I couldn't stop and finished the book in less then a day
B00TPEMK3M|1|Leave the singing to singers; I would rather remember Meryl Streep as a beautiful woman than an ugly witch!
B009UX2YAC|5|It's a fun game for kids.I love going to the different places.you get addicted after a while.I want you to play this game.
B00A6CCF0K|5|I started reading this book and didn't realize it was the sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;.  It was so good that I ended up getting &#34;The Shining&#34; also.  Highly recommend reading this book.
0743270754|5|I received great insights into this time in our history and more specifically the lives of the major characters in the election issues of the 1860's.  Lincoln was surely a genius in the presentation of himself as he perceived the importance of issues that were so devastationally devisive.  Great writing on Goodwin's part........  Her thorough research in the personalities was in evidence.

B00881VLCE|4|MORE FREE PICS! Nicer wilderness pics. Under water is great with the coral. more colors on the blan ones would be cool.
B00EOARZ4G|4|The book held my attention pretty well, however, the back and forth of thirty years was somewhat disjointing. Overall I love the Jack Ryan sagas. Keep them coming.
B000088E6M|5|This cd is hot.....the beats....everything....50 cent is the best rapper out there right now....He gets much respect from me and who ever dosen't have i highly suggest that u get it....HOLLA G-UNIT
B00UXC49P2|3|Interesting book and I enjoyed it.  Would like to know the characters better.  I think it was an enjoyable read.<br />Gloria
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|Awesome two-d game that involves lots of exploring,building,fighting,and mineing. Fight bosses like eye of cythulu, the skletron and the w.o.f. (wall of flesh.)
B004ZQRFGM|5|I bought this CD on a lark based on the accolades from other Amazon customers and it did not disappoint.  The lead track \\"Fearless\\" is really a favorite.  This lady can rock a guitar and considering English is a second language - hits the mark on lyrics as well.  Pick this up.  You will not be disappointed.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Good game !!!!<br />I'm ok with not paying get for stuff in game
B0071XO8RA|4|This book is well written and has a great set of characters and the story keeps up a good pace.
0374275637|5|I believe what I am told.  That is a major intellectual event.  Not unlike the Sarah Palin autobiography this book is amazing.
B0000047CX|5|Such an emotional piece of work, it makes me want to laugh and cry at the same time. Put it on, have a tumbler of Cointreau on the rocks handy, and let the music take you to the other places that exist in the world.<br /><br />So  right for certain moods, and brilliant in execution. There's hardly a  better way to spend such a small amount of money.
B002NZTZ8S|5|Good family Christmas movie
B004H1V5RU|5|Purchased for my 11 year old but the rest of the family from ages 18-49 enjoyed it all night long!
B006LSZECO|5|Great fast paced read!  Hated the ending.
B000VNMMQG|5|a lovely film set in England at the end of the slave trade.  It is about those trying to abolish slave trafficking in England and how difficult it was.
B009ZQC7MY|5|loved it!
B009T9P7OC|4|Very nice sounding player. Like the extended band equalizer. The only con so far is a bit slow loading and search.
B009LDD1X0|5|Brand new in packaging for a great price, helped to add to my complete collection
B00HQLF35I|4|Great Movie.
0062107313|2|I loved \\"The Kitchen God's Wife\\". I really wanted to love this new novel too. Parts of the novel were spellbinding, especially the instruction Magic Gourd gives to Violet. But the rest of the novel is disjointed and amateurish. The novel at times reads like a rough draft~ Characters thoughts and histories are \\"announced\\" by their name in bold type at the beginning of a paragraph. Also at times the character's actions and thoughts grossly contradict their natures. It's as if someone new has materialized. And the history of Violet's mother and father comes too late for us to even care.<br />At 60% on my kindle I started speed reading and skimming~ I was really annoyed with the novel. At 80% I gave up.<br />It's too bad Ms. Tan did not have a better editor~This could have really been amazing!
B008CP6RWU|5|Interesting, fun collection of games
B000YHG72E|5|Haft to watch this movie every year love it
1582701709|5|The Secret is wonderful! Thinking positive is the only way to go.I read it over and over and it not only makes you Happy....It brings more happiness to you! Share the Secret! It is the ONLY Secret you should pass around! Enjoy! and Be Blessed!
B008JGSM6G|5|I love this game. It't as easy or hard as you want it to be as you can choose your level.  You can play at your own pace or timed.  I know my grandkids will like this app (game) next time they are at our home and want to use my tablet to play games.
0525478817|2|The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green<br />(hardcover, 2012)<br /><br />What sort of perspective would an atheist typically bring to a discussion about dying, the possibilities of life after death, or about the (ir)relevance of sexual mores to someone who is dying? This book's tone is pretty representative. It does present a vivid window into the lives of modern teens (albeit atypical ones) dying of cancer, and it does fairly well at critiquing the unhelpful things people do or say (with perhaps too much focus on Christians--p.4-5, 16). Once I was able to accept the extremely precocious main characters, I found the book quite moving. (I agree with other reviewers that the peripheral characters were better and more believable but not very developed.) So in terms of catharsis, and witty dialogue, there is some value.<br /><br />But after its critiques, the book can do little to present a more helpful or uplifting perspective (although the reminder to \\"walk lightly upon the earth\\" is a good one):<br />- \\"And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows everyone else does.\\" (p.13; cf. 312)<br />- \\"Cancer kids are essentially side effects of the relentless mutation that makes the diversity of life on earth possible.\\" (p.49)<br /><br />That tone will turn off many of the more spiritually-minded readers, as will the crass language. (Here are a few samples: 245 258 273 280) Also, vindictiveness is pretty much condoned: 229 277. And lots of sexuality: 19 94 207 etc.<br /><br />As literature, it is quite interesting, though a bit heavy-handed. Some of the metaphors (e.g. the grenade and scar metaphors) are quite good. Here are a few quotes, which may or may not be useful out of context. (Spoiler alert.)<br />- \\"pain demands to be felt\\" (57)<br />- \\"I'm a grenade and at some point I'm going to blow up and I would like to minimize the casualties, okay?\\" (99, cf. 59) \\"Only now that I loved a grenade did I understand the foolishnessof trying to save others from my own impending fragmentation\\" (214)<br />- \\"But there is no shortage of fault to be found amid our stars.\\"(112)<br />- \\"Even though I hated the sympathy people felt toward me, I couldn't help but feel it toward him.\\" (132)<br />- \\"I'm not saying it was your fault. I'm saying it wasn't nice.\\" (135)<br />- \\"'I don't smoke,' he explained, the cigarette dancing in his mouth as he spoke.\\" (146)<br />- \\"Some tourists think Amsterdam is a city of sin, but in truth it is a city of freedom. And in freedom, most people find sin.\\" (157)<br />- \\"You can't dump a girl with a brain tumor\\" (175)<br />-  He: \\"If you don't live a life in service of a greater good, you've gotta at least die a death in service of a greater good, you know? And I fear that I won't get either a life or a death that means anything...\\" She: \\"That's a really mean thing to say to me.\\" [since she hasn't done much either] (168-9)<br />- She: \\"You say you're not special because the world doesn't know about you, but that's an insult to me. I know about you.\\" (240)<br />- \\"According to Maslow, I was stuck on the second level of the pyramid, unable... to reach for love and respect and art and whatever else, which is, of course, utter horsesh--\\" (212)<br />- \\"It felt like losing your co-rememberer meant losing the memory itself\\" (262)<br />- \\"The sequel was a tiny thing to die for, but it was the biggest thing left at his disposal.\\" (304)<br />- \\"She walks lightly upon the earth. Hazel knows the truth: We're as likely to hurt the universe as we are to help it, and we're not likely to do either.\\" (312) [Contrasts with \\"You leave your scar upon me in all this, and I am perpetually grateful for your influence.\\"]
B0000DJZA5|5|[...]  Let it be Naked , from my point of view, is more an album that Let it be the soundtrack. My preference deeping in songs would depend in each song. Is complementary anyhow. And Let it be (both versions) as an album is very strong, I don't know why some consider it a weak album. It contains Get Back, Let it be, Across the Universe, The Long ans winding Road, I've got a feeling and now, Don't  let me down. This are very strong songs.   This era of the Beatles, beside that was not the best in spirit,   musically is absolutetely great (including first solo efforts ).
B00B5HQLMI|4|This is a really good Bond movie.  Love Adele's theme song.  The ending left it open for another movie in the franchise.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Candy Crush Saga is so much fun it's also so addictive it should be called Candy Crack Saga
B00HDMMISA|4|Brilliant satirical take on upscale suburban moms. Love her writing and enjoyed this immensely!
B0064X7FVE|4|Handy
B005CRQ4GU|5|This is another great addition to the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. The story is great, but in the end...well I won't spoil it.
B009178OQA|5|He is really dedicated to hi craft
B00C1BV9Z6|5|This is great entertainment for the entire family. I watched it for the first time a long time ago (when it was released)<br />and now again with my young son. Still a thrill!
B005544V6A|5|It's like Good Will Hunting meets The Rainmaker meets Burn Notice... I don't know, I'm terrible at this. Just watch the show!
B00005JMYI|3|\\"Anchorman\\" just didn't do it for me.  At once it was a laugh out loud, slap your mama funny movie and then it becomes this dull, worn out, drawn out and unfunny Saturday Night Live skit from the mid-90's.  In other words, when it is funny, it's very funny, but when it misses the mark, it misses by a good ol' country mile.<br /><br />Will Ferrell goofs his way through this flick in sometimes funny, but mostly annoying, fashion.  Christina Applegate wasted herself here.  The \\"newsteam\\" that backed up Ferrell was boring.  I have to admit, though, that they captured the oafishness and all out idiotic mentality of most reporters.  I've worked with a few in my day when I was at a local station, and the majority of them aren't half as great as they think they are.  Their egos are bloated well beyond capacity.<br /><br />The funniest parts of this film are when other stars make cameo appearances.  Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson all have wonderful bit parts that result in hilarity.  The gem of the bunch has got to be Jack Black.  His burrito-induced road rage resulting in a punted pooch is classic.<br /><br />I don't recommend purchasing this flick.  It's not silly enough to be considered \\"brainless\\" humor and it is entirely too idiotic to be intelligently funny.  However, the few gutbusters that are found here are worthy of at least one viewing.  Pick it up as a rental and then let fate take over from there.
B00M25DDQE|2|Not good
B00E9HML1Q|2|I own all box editions of LOTR and compared to them Hobbit one is made rather poorly. Figurine cannot match LOTR ones, box filling is cheapish (plastic cover is stuck to styrofoam with transparent tape...). You cannot but regret the space the oversized box will take.<br /><br />Not worth the money.
0345803485|5|Ok, so I've seen alot of bad reviews about this book but I love it! Call me crazy, but this was my first erotic romance book. Some of the characters may seem \\"too real to be true\\" , but HELLO!!!....this is a BOOK! The author has every right to develop his/her characters as they so choose. Noone says you have to read it...oh wait, yeah they do!!! LOL At least those of us who enjoy something of this nature. It's nice to dig into a good book no matter the genre and \\"escape\\"! Christian surprised me when he went to the hardware store Ana works just to see her!! And at the end of the 3rd book, you get a small preview of what seems to be a rewrite of at least the 1st book in Christian's side. And if you read at least the 1st book, you may just do what I did and laugh because you would have NEVER thought that Mr. Christian Grey to be the apprehensive type!! He seems to be a rather bold, cut to the chase guy. Oh well, I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't read these books. Read them for yourself and decide. If you like them, great! If you don't, then turn around, sell them, and don't look back.
B004SBS8LA|5|This is by far the most polished offering from Rovio yet. However, the long wait for future levels to unlock is kind of disappointing for those of us who fly through these levels in minutes. The golden eggs from the original and &quot;seasons&quot; versions are sorely missed. Fighting bosses at the end of episodes sort of makes up for it though.
B00688628M|5|Still an incredible story
B00SH04286|1|Wait for Netflix
0634049011|4|the book explains exverything you need to know about the guitar. it is a great books for every guitar players
B000WQ9UA8|5|I really enjoyed this CD, the music is fun with a techno dance beat.  If you forget all the other stuff going on in her life and just give the CD a chance, I think you will be suprised.
B003O86FMW|5|Love the hunger games collection. It is well worth the read if you enjoy the movies!
B003F256T0|5|I think that this is the best action figure there is.The color was really great.I recommend this action figure to anyone.This action figure came with different accessories such as different faces(6),super saiyan 1 and 2 heads,a cape,and a set of hands(3).I love this action figure!
B00AF6MF9I|4|like the game but having troubles. moving on from first campaign. &quot;preemptive. strike&quot; to next campaign. battle. and cant figure it out
B000002U82|5|This CD can be explianed simply as a forty-five minute auditory orgasm!    If you buy any CD, buy this one!
B00AAQRNQ8|5|I was very pleased with this mouse. It's simple enough to were anyone can use it and elegant enough to make my friends jealous. What I personally like best about it is is larger size for my big hands. Th is is the fist mouse that is actually big enough to fit into my Palm. Love it.
B00GP0G0IK|5|Just bought this game and I love it. Also it seems to be discounted right now . I received 400 amazon tokens for the purchase , more tokens back  than advertised. Great story so far ... and no HOGs !
B000000W5L|5|If you like a deep groove rock jam and have the blues in your heart... this IS the GREATEST RECORD EVER!  Features some of Jagger's best vocals, Mick Taylor and Keith riffing guitar blues, bouncy rhythms and piano, it's all there in PEAK PERFORMANCES by all players (including the excellent cast of sidemen.) Incredibly soulful. I want to be buried with this one.<br /><br />added note: I've recently listened to a few covers of songs off \\"Exile\\"  performed in various genres (blues, bossanova, what have you) and I'm struck at how well the SONGS hold up under re-imagined and/or faithful interpretations.  Speaks to the excellence of the Stones' original songcraft.  EXCELLENT ALBUM. Buy it. All of it.
B006TVQU6C|2|About the only nice things about this case are the color and finish to include absence of jagged edges but everything else is cheap, fragile and poorly thought out. It dents and distorts easily. It weighs less than 4 pounds because its 1 nanometer thick pot metal. The drive bay covers are gonna get dirty and stay that way because the foam is glued onto them and all the grill are going to dent because the steel is so cheap. Might as well make it out of paper.
0307591549|5|Written with humor, science and understanding. Makes you laugh and strengthens one resolve to keep moving forward in a positive light. Share and pay it forward.
B004WKOCP8|4|Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion. Here's mine.    I respect Incubus fans, because of the fact that THIS BAND IS TALENTED. They have provided us with excellent music over the years, taking us in all sorts of directions musically; evolving , and always exploring new territory. In my book, if you like Incubus, and have kept up with them, you must have good musical taste.    That being said, I'm a little shocked at the reviews here for this fine album. I don't see how an album like \\"If Not Now, When?\\" can recieve a rating any lower than THREE stars (I give it FOUR myself). What am I missing?? Oh, it must be the fact that the've slowed down a little, maybe even matured a little. A common misconception, lack of aggression = Bad music. This is simple 100% uncorrect. I understand if you prefer aggressive tunes, but to go as far as to say that the new album is bad because it lack aggression, well, maybe listen again, and keep the mind open. It might be good for you to keep your heart rate down a little.    I was pulled in from track number One, I really found myself \\"involved\\" in the dreamy textures they were pulling together. All the while thinking, man!, Incubus should do this type of stuff for an entire album sometime......11 tracks later, I discovered they had done just that.    I also have always been fond of the energy Incubus has on previous albums, but I really find myself going back more to the slow tunes from over the years, those are the ones that have stuck with me the most. Therefore, I have a great appreciation for what the guys have done here, it a very nice addition to their catalog.    Now, the reason, I didn't go for the full 5 stars (though I believe in the musical world of Incubus that rating goes to \\"Make Yourself\\" only anyway), but the reason I went with the four stars is because the song \\"Switchblade\\" is very much out of touch here. It doesnt fit within the mood that has been set by the other tracks on the album.    Anybody whose enjoyedIncubus over the years, and isn't turned of by a more mellow sound, should pick this up as soon as possible, it's great stuff!!!
B0027BOL4G|2|This film was extremely disappointing.  I was hoping for a clear, riveting summary of the environmental and health problems created because of the food industry in this country.  I wanted an exposition of the inhumane techniques used to raise animals, the government policies and subsidies that contribute to the system, and the alternatives.  The filmmaker touched on these points, but I didn't feel they were clearly made (read Michael Pollen's The Omnivore's Dilemma instead).  Many of the people interviewed in the film are inarticulate and hence boring to listen to, and the pacing is very slow. If I wasn't already a \\"true believer,\\" this film would not have convinced me of the problem.
0767817710|4|Well, if you want bad acting (except for Hackman) you got it, but if you want to be dazzled by beautiful camera shots which make the camera an active participant within the film, watch it (but turn the volume down).  Simply put..acting..bad...camera style...good.
B0008GNJZY|1|Wow, this movie was really going places.  I loved how Carter comes to be quite the hero in this flick.  It shows that there are more important things than our temporary activities.  It proves that one really needs to sort out what they need to do and take care of everything so they can make something of oneself -- So sad to say...  This really had it going on until our little side plot lovebird discovers his girlfriend has gotten rid of her child.  The reason why is because supposedly she learned how to deal with life and did what she needed to do to get on the right track.  So isn't that wonderful...  we learn that abortion is ok!!!  I'm sorry, this was a fantastic movie but that totally ruined it!  Promoting such a thing is horrible.  Especially since we see how influential media and other are on our society.  If that part were taken out this would be a 5 star rating.  A great moral was given, but one major wrong was impressed on viewers.  And just like the coach said, if one person fails the team fails.  This movie failed because one wrong was done.
B00FAPF5U0|5|One of my FAVORITE games!!!!
0345803450|2|Had I read this, I'd have stopped mid-way, bored with the repetition and whining, gone to the end to see the revelations promised in the early pages.  However, as I listened to Juliet Stevenson's truly excellent narration instead, I stuck with the book.  Got to the end and realized how badly I'd been played, been had by the author.<br /><br />I am of the same era as Serena and initially thought McEwan had gotten his hands on my late-teens-into-twenties diaries.  Except that I did not keep any.  But the thoughts and the thinking from then were embarrassingly familiar and pulled me in for the first half - like coming across an old photo, being glad no one else can see the dorkiness therein.  I could even imagine Rita Tushingham [\\"Girl with the Green Eyes\\"] or Lynn Redgrave [\\"Georgy Girl\\"] playing Serena - \\"Sweet Tooth\\" is so redolent of that era, of the experience of mixing late girlhood, being in college, meeting a fading professor, first job, et al. But it goes on and on, like an old LP stuck in a groove.<br /><br />Serena's intense dislike of Tom's \\"ape\\" story, his tricking the reader, his dishonesty caught me.  She was quite right in her dismay.  And, at the end, with a sly wink, McEwan does the exact same thing to the reader.  What a scam!<br /><br />The only thing I was left wondering about was - as Serena certainly does have the gift for devoting herself to knaves - did she see how dastardly her lover was or did she go blindly to him, sobbing out her love, her gratitude to him for his hateful confession.  But by then I didn't much care.
B006MW3V6U|5|This is a delightful series about an aristocratic family during World War I.  It is filled with intrigue, humor, and has a great love story underlying the saga.  We thoroughly enjoyed watching it and are waiting anxiously for Season 3 to be available.
B00A6CCF0K|5|Have been a fan of The King (Stephen) for many years. I know he doesn't appeal to everyone but those who do appreciate his work are loyal. This sequel to the Shining rocks.
B00A8ECU24|1|It will not run on my ASUS tablet.
B000A2IPP0|5|I would say buy this only and I mean only if you did not buy the Limited Edition Collector's edition released a couple of years ago.  That was a 2 disc set that inclcuded the Original E.T. and the Updated one which I bought I would not buy this single disc set with the updated movie only.  However if you do not own E.t. on Dvd buy this becuase you cannot get the collector's edition acept for buying it from a 3rd party here on Amazon but as said for us who own the collector;s edition this dvd is not worth the purchase.  The 5 star rating is for E.t. is one of my favorite movies this release gets a 1 star based on the collector;s edition is much better.
0307730697|5|If you are looking for a story about Faith, a wonderful love story, a different way of looking at your own life, and a new found respect for the men and women of our Country, this is it.  Adam Brown was a man every single person should strive to be like.  I walked away from this book feeling like a part of the Brown family, and wanting to thank each and every one of them for standing by Adam to help him become the wonderful man he rose to be.  My parents attend Church with Kelley and I would love to personally thank her for being an inspiration to me in my own relationship and the desire to never give up on the ones you love.  An exceptional, exceptional story of an even more exceptional man.
B00APUQT7I|5|What a funny video!  Great viewing for the whole family.  I would highly recommend it.  Great family video to watch when it's cold/snowing/raining out.
B004GJDQT8|5|They are there when you need them and you talk to person you can understand
B00009V7OL|3|The Blu-ray of this film is planned for sometime later this year (2013,) and should be essentially the same package.  This DVD version is very, very old, and looks it -- it's the same as the early 1990's Laserdisc.  Wait for a better presenation, if you can.  If not, just don't pay a fortune for it.
B00DJFIMW6|4|Fun and addictive...a little confusing on rules of game such as I haven't figured out how you get the minion coins without buying them but a great game overall!
B008Y2VTIS|4|Saw the first season on DVD. It's pretty good. LIke all serials, they hook you in even if it's mediocre. But the sets and attention to detail on costumes and the period look is pretty cool. The older viewers of us will get a lot of &#34;Oh, wow. I remember those things.&#34; It's pretty violent at times and boring at others. Over all worth a try at least. Still better than most shows produced for tv.
B00007KWHG|5|After see Jersey Boys, I had to have some of the Four Season's music.  This is a great collection of their music.

B004J4WNL2|5|She does a very good job of deconstructing a misunderstood concept. I found her insights and explanations spot on! Very well done!
B00005O5CM|3|Legally Blonde is not particularly complex, but is perfect escapism movie to get your mind off things and relax.<br />The message here is &quot;Don't judge a book by its cover&quot;.  And we could all use a lesson in that.  The outer shell is never the entire story when it comes to each individual person.  Not only is REESE WITHERSPOON'S character an example of that, but everyone in the movie is.  That's the best part about Legally Blonde.  Reese's character is not what she appears to be on the surface and the producers don't stop there.  Some characters are what they appear, and some surprise you.<br />Although Legally Blonde isn't much better than average when it comes to movies, it does make its point in a fun and entertaining way.
B000024D4R|5|With all the attention surrounding, DarkSide of the Moon and The Wall, often Animals gets overlooked. Sure, there is Wish You Were Here, Meddle and even early work like Clouds and Saucer, but none of it compares. I am a big fan of Roger Waters/Pink Floyd and even Post Roger Waters, Pink Flyod, and everything they have done peeked at Animals. The combination of Hard Rock with a very Classically composed melady and lyrics, that you just have to listen to (because not only did they speak for that time, but they still relavent about today), all come together to produce the MOST UNDERRATED rock and roll album ever.<br />Animals, like The Final Cut, are very hard albums to get into. They aren't as flashy or have catchy songs like some of the more popular works, but they are strong works that need to be listen to over and over again to appreaciate how good they are. I know you may think why do I have to listen to it over and over again? Beacuse it is so good, that it takes time just for you to pick up how subtlly brilliant it really is.<br />Animals, is an album composed of masterful simple music, strengthened by David Gilmour's phenomenal guitar and  surrounding prolific lyrics from Roger Waters.  It simply starts and ends with a single aucoustic guitar and then takes off into another world with Dogs (This is quite possibly the best Floyd song ever, live version is even better), Pigs [Three different ones] and Sheep (a close second, in best Floyd best song ever). Dogs and Sheep anchor this album with David Gilmour's guitar, speaking to you when there are no lyrics, and accompanied by calming keyboards, that leave you in an almost transcendent state. You lose yourself when listening to Animals, before you know it, the album is over, you've been daydreaming for forty-five minutes and you want to listen to it again. This is simply a must own if you are a Floyd fan, even if you are just a small time fan.<br />...&quot;After a while, you can work on points for style. Like a club tie and a firm handshake, sudden look in the eye, an easy smile. You have to be trusted, by the people you lied, so when they turn thier backs on you, you get the chance to put the knife in.&quot;
B000TDG9LM|4|Really like the group.  Always have been a fan of this type of music.  One of my favorites for my daily walk with my dog.
B000SXMSJ0|5|this the best album I have bought in a long time, an instant classic, I don't get tired of listening.
B009MCRHH6|5|This is a fun and inventive puzzle/construction game. Chances are, if you're looking at this, you're already at least sort of familiar with the game, as it's been out on PC for quite some time, but you may be wondering how it makes the transition to Android. Thankfully, this is a very solid port. There were a few occasional slowdowns on my phone, but I'm more inclined to blame that on my older phone than the program itself. Gameplay is very intuitive with a touchscreen. I tend to prefer mouse/keyboard or game controller to touchscreen for game, but this game works really well with touch controls. The only issue I had in that department was that my (large) fingers sometimes obscured what I was trying to do; I expect this would be less of an issue with a stylus or on a tablet instead of a phone screen (mine is ~4.5&#34; diagonal). In any event, I have played through the entire game on my phone with only minor annoyance at times when I needed to place goo balls precisely.<br /><br />In short, it's still a very fun and innovative game, and if you haven't played it before, or just want to revisit, the Android version is a great way to go. Highly recommended.
B00DPM7TIG|4|Mr. Doerr is one of those few writers who can actually paint pictures with words. This was one of those books I didn't want to end. If you like historical fiction, this is the book for you.
B0009P5YXO|5|I bought this for my 19 year old boyfriend's birthday, and I don't think he's put it down since. After reading the reviews it is exactly what I expected. It's obviously plastic and feels a bit light at first, but it's the perfect size and the designs on the handle give it a very realistic look. It's lasted for months without breaking and is an excellent deal.
0395389496|5|What can one say about an illustrator like Van Allsburg? The Polar Express is almost not a children's story but for the child with a vivid imagination (and may there still be a few in existence!!) they will identify with the little boy who travels in his dreams by the Polar Express. I know they have mad an animated film of this book and done it well but it really is more a nostalgia trip for adults. I have never seen a Van Allsburg done badly they are always incredible books and I would love to own the lot. Highly recommended!
6304813759|5|The flow of this movie reminded me a lot of Dead Poets Society.  It seemed like not a whole lot was going on but the end of both movies had me up and cheering for the characters.  I was especially touched about the true  affection the &quot;fat&quot; guy and his wife shared.  The scene where the  guys are rehearsing and obviously uncomfortable about taking off their  clothes in front of each other made you feel their pain. The scene with the  guys standing in the unemployment line and their reaction to the Donna  Summer song over the Muzak is a classic in my book.  If the movie seems  boring to you at first, hang in there.  It all comes together and you will  be glad you watched it.
0679745653|4|I always like to read the original work before seeing what the director does with it, which is why I got to movie too!
B0002KZAKS|4|I got one of these several years ago, brand new.  Lately I have been reading lots of reviews for gear again, and felt a need to review this mic.<br /><br />Its a really good one for the money, similar to the SM57 or 58.  I now have an SM57, and a 58, both are great mics. The 8500 is good, very similar. I think if you take care of your stuff, and have realistic expectations, then its a good buy. For a time, I only had the 8500 mic for my home recording.<br />I use the 8500 and a Peavey mic now as backups, and mostly use the Shures.<br /><br />FWIW, my mic came in a padded case, with a mic clip, but did not come with a cable.  A lot of mics don't come with the cable, unless its some sort of package deal.
079070546X|5|Are you sure Sparky isn't my husband????  This is the greatest Christmas movie ever.  This is a family classic that we watch and continue to laugh at each and every year!  I start the day after Thanksgiving and continue  all through the holidays watching this wonderful movie!`

B00ADQPA38|5|American horror story is one of the most original series on TV. Each season is completely different from the last. Most of the stars return each season but in completely different roles. This second season is about an insane asylum and the people the run it. This series is very intense. Not recommended for kids. The acting is fantastic and the story is great. Highly recommended.
1439102732|5|Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors and her portrayal of the main characters in all of her books are very well researched.  This book was no exception.  I couldn't put it down!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Such a wonderful story. Heartbreakingly so. You can't help but fall in love with the characters as you cry with them, laugh with them, and face oblivion.
B0045KG84I|3|Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah were funny, but the transforming taxi was a little over the top. The bank robbers were hot.
1606863622|5|I absolutely loved reading Dear John! It was a story that encouraged me to speculate and ask questions. It engaged my attention in a way that made me want to keep reading to figure out the answers and I even continued to speculate after finishing the story about what would have happened if it had ended differently. I knew going into the novel that I had a certain level of schema from other Nicolas Sparks books and movies, which helped me to understand the book and predict how I thought the book was going to end! It was a wonderful enjoyable story that made me laugh, cry, and engage in the lives of Savannah and John! I highly recommend!
B00006J3T4|5|WOW!!! MARK KNOPFLER AND DIRE STRAITS WERE ONE OF THE GREATEST ARTISTS EVER AROUND. THEY ARE TALENTED AND MAKE GREAT MUSIC. SOME OF MY FAVORITE SONGS I HAVE EVER HEARD ARE FROM MARK KNOPFLER (WITHOUT DIRE STRAITS). COYOTE ROCKS, LISTEN TO THE INTRO AND THE END. KNOPLFER WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT!!!!! I KNOW HE WILL. <br /> <br />WHIRLIGIG.
B00KBCN9X2|4|😄 very good read. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read the next one.<br />Finally found someone to replace the Mitch rapp series by Vince flynn.
B005LAIISA|5|This whole series are some very good movies. I absolutely love these movies
B00EMXBDMA|5|It's so refreshing to read sci fi written by someone who really understands the science and doesn't resort to gimmicky plot points, love interests, or aliens. A great read.
B00JP5ONY0|4|Really decent movie.. Enjoyed the imagination put behind it and the ending was excellent.
B00BFUUMO8|5|It is a awesome game
B00J2PEZAU|1|Rarely ever give up on a movie, but this was a complete waste of time.  Never has a movie made me care less about the story.
B009Z5975A|5|Three great classic movies, the reason for writing this brief review is that I don't understand the Jan 2013 release date?<br />This is selling in my local Wal-Mart for $10<br />Do yourself a favor, grab a bargain for Christmas.
B000PMG16U|5|Star Wars on Blu-ray. .....? No brainer!
B000002U9P|5|Tina Turner had a very busy 1985-one which a childhood me remembers quite well. This woman couldn't appear on TV,stage or screen without getting people's rapt attention. Her songs came on the radio? People listened in with the same fervor. It wasn't blind hero worship by any means. Seemed to me it was genuine respect for a soul survivor. And one who had succeeded beyond most people's expectations. Following her success in the movie Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,she received an NAACP Image Award. And was promptly back in the studio recording her follow up album with the participation of Terry Britten,Rupert Pine,Bryan Adams an Mark Knopfler as her producers. It had the awkwardness of having to follow up a blockbuster. But it actually ended up firmly on it's own legs.<br /><br />  &#34;Typical Male&#34; opens the album with a strongly synthesized orchestrated dance-funk number-as is the title song while &#34;What You Get Is What You See&#34; is an electronic honky tonk style country/soul dance number. &#34;Two People&#34; is a slow burning,creamy reggae/pop-jazz style number-same as with the slightly more upbeat &#34;Till The Right Man Comes Along&#34;-which brings in a Willie Mitchell/Al Green style Southern soul flavor back into the mix. &#34;Afterglow&#34; is a stripped down and sensuous smooth funk groover. &#34;Girls&#34; and the closing &#34;I'll Be Thunder' are dynamic,arena friendly progressive pop/rock numbers. &#34;Break Every Rule&#34; has a bluesier feel from Bryan Adams. &#34;Overnight Sensations&#34; delivers a rockabilly style country/blues type riff via  Knopfler. &#34;Paradise Is Here&#34; is a dramatic rock/gospel number.<br /><br />  Tina's world tour for this album,and it's accompanying live album,broke records to such a degree it landed her a place in the Guinness Book Of World Records. As much of an icon of personality as Tina Turner was at this point? This album actually differs in many ways from the previous one. There is somewhat of a more concerted attempt to connect Tina to her roots in the American South. There are far more musical references to guitar based rock 'n' roll,much of it very arena friendly as well as elements of country and blues on this album. And while the sheen of the production polish is every bit as present here? This album was noticeably not the same as what came before. It doesn't tend to be as remembered or even revered as Private Dancer. But it did successfully showcase that,even in the midst of her biggest commercial success as a solo artist,she had no fears whatsoever about changing up and moving on musically.ted attempt to connect Tina to her roots in the American South.

B00BW6SOIQ|3|Mediocrity has won...huzzah....we all accept sensationalism in the face of painful truth....  Honesty neither particularly kind, nor true...life is a series of lies told to you by those who love/live you and give you reason to move on...co me one come all...view the end of faith...
B008UCJ7KO|4|I love the Characters! And the friendships in here. I really do wish the author would tone down on the language....I mean really is it necessary? Aside from that if you love the 50 shades series you will love these books as well.
B005E2PQTE|1|Unless your BluRay player was manufactured in the UK or maybe Europe also, don't but this title. You won't have a picture to watch.
B009KYXEY6|5|Born into This......Born Yesterday......Born in the USA....... Born to Run.....Born to be Wild...... Born to Lose...... and then......Born to Die. All of these titles to uniquely American songs and poetry with their psychological blues and themes are what \\"Lana Del Rey\\" is offering to the Gods.<br /><br />This is one the most beautiful records produced by an (new) American artist in a long while. Her torch song delivery mixed with all of the 'big\\" modern sounds of today, goes right for the heart....and the throat. Make no mistake about it, this young woman is an artist and if she never makes another album she has delivered to the listening public an album of truth and beauty and depth, through the medium of \\"pop\\" music. This has got a great sound with melodies and lyrics that stay in your mind.<br /><br />A deep well of young/female desolation and sadness tinged with toughness and desire is present in her music. Her voice and style resonate with American mythical culture and a nostalgic longing.... Gorgeous!<br /><br /> Her videos are very good and the new one, \\"Ride\\" (the long story version) is even better than anything else from this album. This video is one of the best ever made about the dark heart of the \\"American Dream\\". Musically, visually and psychologically stunning.....David Lynch should be proud to have influenced this artist.<br /><br />Deep meaning.....deep as the search for life and love....and deep as death.
B0000DD7LB|5|Im giving it 5 stars based on the music, not on her or her personal life. This is one of the best pop albums I've heard. It was not as big of a commercial hit as her previous albums, but this one is filler free. Every song is good. Some standout tracks for me are Brave New Girl, Everytime, Breathe on Me, Ealry Mornin and of course Toxic. The fact that Britney co-wrote most of the tracks makes it even better. I bought this the week it came out and still listen to it regularly.
1608870081|5|I bought this for someone as a gift.  She loves all things &#34;Harry Potter&#34;.  She was excited to share it with her elementary age children.
B000M341QO|4|Some of the stuff @ the end you just never saw it coming.  It kind of reminds me of the ending to Lucky Number Slevin, JUST NOT AS GOOD.  Lots of twists.  I didn't mind the love triangle between the cops & their psychiatrist lady but it kind of made it distasteful.  The ending would have been just as good without Dicaprio's character & the psych chic having a relationship.  Anyway - beside all that I was quites surprised I liked the movie that much.  Some parts of the storylines we've seen before but oh well.  If the script writers were gonna remake a Japanese movie they might as well do a good job.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|This book is so heartfelt heart wrenching one the best I have read in a while. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves a book that you can not put down.
B0000B3FCX|4|Nickelback was one of my favorite bands at one point, but after their overplayed success with Silver Side Up I found my self not listening to them as much, I got this cd only half excited and thinking mabye I should wait or save my money for Korn next month, but after I got home and played this album a few times I was 100% satisfied.  Here's my track by track review:<BR>1) Flat on the Floor - (9/10) Great hard opener, awesome for speeding at night with you friends<BR>2) Do this Anymore - (8/10) Nicely peiced together, my bet is this will be their next single<BR>3) Someday - (5/10) This just isn't my type of song, and it sounds to much like their other radio stuff, sounds like it should be on one of those evil &quot;Now&quot; cds my sister likes.<BR>4) Believe or Not - (8.5/10) Has a Papa Roach sounding guitar riff, good hard rock sound<BR>5) Feelin' Way too Damn Good - (8.5/10) Has an Aerosmith ballad sound to it, I remember first hearing this song on the Nickelback Live at Home dvd when Chad was making it up as he went along (bonus footage), I guess he ended up liking it.<BR>6) Because of You - (9/10) Great angry sounding song, I wish my band wrote this first.<BR>7) Figured you Out - (9/10) Cool almost comical lyrics and good chorus.<BR>8) Should've Listened - (5.5/10) They need to stick to the hard stuff, sounds to much like a country song.<BR>9) Throw Yourself Away - (7.5/10) Cool guitar sound with nice little slide solo, but alittle repetitive.<BR>10) Another hole in the Head - (9/10) &quot;Old Enough 2&quot;, but Old enough is one of my favorite Nickelback songs, so thats a good thing<BR>11) See you at the Show - (9/10) Gets better every time I listen to it, mabye surpases &quot;Good times Gone&quot; off Silver Side Up, which in my opinion is one of the best closer songs ever.<BR>12) Saturday Night's Alright - (9/10) Clever, and nicley executed<BR>13) Yanking out my... - (8.5/10) Another one that just keeps getting better<BR>14) Learn the Hardway - (8/10) Different sounding than any other previous Nickelback stuff.<BR>As for individual instruments, Drums, great with plenty of little fills to keep you entertained. Guitars, being a guitar player myself I'm a bit on the critical side this albums pretty much barre chord paradise and slide solos galore with occasional finger taps (Saturday Night's Alright), I like how each song seems to have a different distortion.  Bass, nothing special just follow the lead stuff.  Vocals, Chads got a great grunge rock sounding voice that definitly stands out here. Hope my review helped.  (I gave it a 4 because I never give anything a perfect review) I think I might still like &quot;The State&quot; better, be sure to by that one first if you don't own any Nickelback yet.
B00HTK4KIC|4|Great but pages were torn out.
B00000JZC4|4|Filter creates an incredible aura around their music. The riveting sound is incredible, and the quick switches between refrains that are quiet and sullen (\\"I tried to pray... yes, I will give it a shot\\") to more robust and thick chunky riffs (\\"I am a creepy man, I can't believe the things I've done to you\\") are, in my opinion, the hallmark of this group. And, finding my 'Title of Record' CD somewhere in the back corners of my CD collection, I've managed to rediscover a CD that kept me warm for some time during undergrad.<br />Something about Filter is just incredible. Their lyrics are more or less hit-and-miss. They certainly don't compare too favourably to Richard Patrick's former 'band'-mate Trent Reznor and his sonorous and more poetic musings. Overlayed with the music, however, the tunes just 'stick.' I guess that makes the criticism a bit lacklustre since few of us sit down with the lyric sheet to read separate and apart from listening to the actual songs.<br />This album, in particular, is more harmoniously put together. The songs mesh and are worthy of a thorough listen-through. Song to song, until the CD is through.<br />There is something distinctive about Filter. The rich textured vocals, the catchiness of some of the songs, the industrial hints, and the drum machines give off a melody that is sometimes fun and poppy, and sometimes a bit more disturbing.<br />It's why I am glad to have found this old friend again. I'm listening to it right now, sitting at the library, writing this review. Honestly! (\\"no cop, no fun, I don't care... Every one of you could be the same, every one of you could play this game...\\" and so on). It's a keeper.

B002722R64|3|This is probably the only Pierce Brosnan James Bond movie that I like, I guess it was unique for its time but after the new Bond movies and movies like the Bourne series these old James Bond movies just don't cut the cake when it comes to Womanizing assassin.
B00CWY76CC|4|Game is a good reasoning game. Tests memory too. Looking forward to playing more. Great way to play with kids. Sometimes very frustrating.
B00T3DNKIE|5|I will leave the technical reviews to others more learned and sophisticated about writing, and say simply that I loved the perspective of this book and that I think it happened as it should that Go Set a Watchman was published after To Kill a Mockingbird.  To those who complain about the iconic Atticus Finch having feet of clay after all, I'd simply say, grow up.  This is real life in the mid 20th century southern states and many other areas of the country.  Real life can be a big, messy, beautiful learning experience... If we are lucky!
B00008EY65|5|After crafting an unappreciated classic with Blade 2, director Guillermo del Toro brings Mike Mignola's classic Dark Horse Comics character to life in this stunning and superbly crafted film.  In a last ditch effort to turn the tide of World War II, a Nazi experiment to bring forth a creature of destruction results in the coming of a horned, red skinned creature, aptly called Hellboy (Ron Perlman, perfectly cast), who over the years is raised by Professor Broom (John Hurt) and works for the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, battling otherworldly creatures alongside his amphibious partner Abe Sapien (played by Doug Jones and voiced by Fraiser's David Hyde Pierce) while nursing a love for the pyrotechnical Liz (Selma Blair).  del Toro and his crew have really crafted something special here, paying wonderful homage to Mignola's source material while del Toro's screenplay adds another layer of development to the characters, taking the relationships between Hellboy, Broom, and Liz to never before imagined heights.  Perlman, mostly known for his role on TV's Beauty & the Beast, is perfect is Hellboy, and I can't imagine anyone else whether it be Nicolas Cage or Vin Diesel (both of whom were rumored to have attachments to the film in early development) to play the hero.  It's not perfect, and not up there with the original Batman, Blade, or X2: X-Men United; but Hellboy is without a doubt one of the most brilliantly conceived visual feasts adapted from a comic book of all time, and fans of Hellboy old and new will find plenty to admire with this film.
B007SGLZP8|5|I very much enjoyed the story. At times you think you've figured it out but soon find a twist not anticipated.

B00005JP4U|5|An artist hopes for one thing. Craftsmen do not hope; they merely make something, and sell it. <br /> <br />A craftsman would be a music group like the band \\"Hot Hot Heat.\\"  <br /> <br />They make a song, they make it so someone can listen to it, jump around to the beat of the song, relate to the lyrics on an emotional and philosophical level, and feel an emotion as an effect. <br /> <br />One could use the verb \\"hope\\" in terms of a craftsmen in that, \\"They hope someone will like their song, and buy it, and that they can be famous, so they can have sex with lots of pretty girls who like to jump around to the beat of their music,\\" but that would be not my useage of the word hope. I would say, \\"A craftsman wants someone to like their song, so they can get paid, and do what they like to do with their life.\\" This is no different than Apple computers making their iPods the coolest and smallest they can make them. \\"Hot Hot Heat,\\" whose music is quite fun and cool, and deserve all the pretty girls they can get, makes their songs as fun and cool as they can make them.  <br /> <br />It is NOT more vain that they just want someone to like thier song, it is NOT immoral ; it is what most people do ; but it is without hope. <br /> <br />All men need hope. Artist and craftsman.  <br /> <br />I need hope, and that is why i will remain an artist.  <br /> <br />Craftsmen find hope through other means.  <br /> <br />But an artist, through what he creates, hopes.  <br /> <br />Every sentence, note or brushstroke he produces can be translated to: i hope.  <br /> <br />What does he hope for ? <br /> <br />An artist hopes for change. <br /> <br />An artist hopes one who experiences what has been created he or she will not be able to live their life the same way after the fact.  <br /> <br />An artist does not necessarily try to create beauty, he does not necessarily try to create truth, he does not necessarily try to soothe OR stimulate ; an artist could chose any of these things, or hecould chose none of them, but he choses them to hope for change.  <br /> <br />Sometimes, this is small change in one's life. For example, the famous William Carlos Williams poem: <br /> <br />so much depends <br />upon  <br /> <br />a red  <br />wheelbarrow <br /> <br />glazed in rain  <br />water  <br /> <br />beside the white  <br />chickens  <br /> <br />Now that you have read that poem, your life will be different in a very small way. You might say the word \\"chickens\\" with a slightly different feeling for the word. You might see red as a little more of an interesting color. You might notice the weight of the things you say, the heaviness of the syllables, the heaviness of the thoughts they bring, or you might just every so often mutter to yourself, \\"Beside the white chickens,\\" because it has a pleasing sound to you.  <br /> <br />Williams does not care if you \\"like\\" his poem, if you would pay five dollars to have it read to you--for proof, read his collected letters to publishers. You may end up paying five dollars for it, but that is not his concern. He wants you to be different, he wants to toss you into the horror of his world, and make you understand it. He wants change. <br /> <br />An artist is a terrorist.  <br /> <br />I paid five dollars today. <br /> <br />I saw An Inconvenient Truth.  <br /> <br />It was art.  <br /> <br />It was a kind of art i do not often view, It was art whose materials were equal parts science, drama and truth.  <br /> <br />Like Williams' poem, it was hoping.  <br /> <br />But it hoped far beyond anything Williams ever wrote.  <br /> <br />It hoped with a child's mind, it hoped with a purity and a logic.  <br /> <br />And it changed me. <br /> <br />I don't know who else in the small small matinee audience it changed, but i hope it changed everyone in there.  <br /> <br />I cannot go on living my life in the same way.  <br /> <br />I mean this with sincerity i rarely know.  <br /> <br />I am weary with catharsis, i have cried and i have raged and i have hated, and now i am ready to move on.  <br /> <br />I am ready to be someone different.  <br /> <br />Starting with these words.  <br /> <br />I hope you liked this review, and i know there are many reasons why you might not.  <br /> <br />For example, the style is very plain and may come off as careless ; and its logic might seem ill. <br /> <br />But this review is art. To me. <br /> <br />You may decide if it is bad art, but it will still be art. Because i wrote this with the hope that you will be changed after reading it, and you will go see An Inconvenient Truth tonight at seven at your local theater, instead of the Da Vinci Code, instead of Mission Impossible Three, instead of Garfield: A Tale of Two Kittens, instead of even another movie i have given a rave review in the past. Even the movies that are listed as my all time favorites, i hope that you will see this first, and then them ; and i hope that you will be changed by it.

1451695195|5|I am hoping to buy this book for a number of friends. The implications of Eben's story are truly astonishing,and leave you feeling better for having read it.  If a near death experience was going to happen to anyone, it had to be him. He is the perfect emissary of the world beyond.
B00N2TYQJC|5|Awesome Black Eyes !!!
B0084IG7KC|5|Thanks
B00ECU2RGY|4|The movie is decent. Typical and predictable. However the score of this movie is nothing short of amazing. It makes this 3 star movie into a 4 star movie.
0060899190|5|I agree that there are some layout problems, but they do not overshadow the overall message and impact that this book has.  If I had the money, I'd buy this book for everyone I know.
1451648537|5|A good story about Steve Jobs however, it is a great book about the silicon valley revolution. I recommend this book not just for Apple consumers, but for those interested in technology.
B003WUYRGI|5|It was awesome<br /> Ithought it was absolutely fearsome the words were amazing  excellent word choice throughout the story it was absolutely absract it was awe inspiring i think it was one of the very best books i have ever read
B004E547D8|1|I love all the actors/actresses in this movie, but it disappointed.  If the movie was a little more in depth and had more acting it would have been alright.  The characters look like they are just talking not acting.  I dont do movie reviews unless it was awesome or terrible.  Well this one was pretty darn bad.  Glad I didnt waste a bunch of money on it.
B00001NFCY|5|&quot;Human Clay&quot; is my first Creed album, and I feel it won't be my last. Lead singer Scott Stapp cuts to the bone with his ragged and powerful, yet still eerily beautiful voice. Background guitar riffs are executed with great skill and monster sound; it is at once both grungy, heavy, moody and moving. Some of the riffs take me back to the sound which Metallica used to have...no bad thing indeed! Although the album is not revolutionary, it is by all means a welcome return to a sound which has been too absent in recent years. I like pop music, but sometimes it becomes too much and then Creed is a perfect relief.<br />The songs exude intense emotion, ranging from melancholy through rage to sheer joy. As a listener, you can't help feeling it, which is a wonderful achievement, and it makes Creed rise head and shoulders above the rest. I have heard a little about Creed being a Christian band and all that, but everyone has a right to believe in what he or she wishes. Renouncing Christianity is in vogue these days for some reason, but I see no reason why a band should be chastised for believing in God. Personally I'm not religious, but I know great music when I hear it, and on &quot;Human Clay&quot; I have heard just that. Furthermore, the lyrics actually seem more about life than religion, so the whole thing is just blown out of proportion.<br />In short, this album is a very athmospheric piece of art, and if you like bands such as Bush, Korn, Three Doors Down, Tool, Soundgarden and the like, you really cannot go wrong with &quot;Human Clay&quot;. I recommend it highly!

B000001EGA|5|This album was released at the peak of Sir Elton's career &amp; it hold's it's mark as one of the best albums of Sir &amp; Bernie's long &amp; fruitfull collaborations. Meal Ticket is one of EJ's best rockers despite the fact that is wasn't released as a single. The title track is Americana Pop at it's finest, bitter fingers-tower of bable &amp; better off dead are are as powerful tracks as they are self sarcastic. The unmistakable gems of this album (aside from the title track) are unmistakenably the autobiographical &quot;someone saved my life tonight&quot; the haunting and emotional &quot;we all fall in love sometimes with curtains as it's climax. Additonally with the addition of the classic mega singles &quot;philadelphia freedom &amp; the best cover in the world ever &quot;lucy in the sky with diamonds&quot; this album is one of the 5 best of Sir's marvelous legacy.
B005HSL626|4|This game is really fun and somewhat addictive. I liek the different game mode so you can play according to how attentive you really are. So simple to play and anyone can play it.
B007Q35PLI|5|Shows how perceptions can differ for those with autism it is a fast paced funny film that should keep students very engaged. PG too!
B005RUUUAI|5|This season was just as good as Season 1.  The actors are great as is the storyline.  I know many people who watch this faithfully.
0786275391|5|This is a book I believe everyone should read at least once in their life. Preferably more.
B00E8KLWB4|4|This is a fun game. Wish it would show where the items are you didn't find when your time is up.
1451695195|5|Quite a story especially considering this Doctor was a skeptic himself!! A very amazing story of prayer that was answered! Truly a miraculous recovery....unexplained by science!!
B0060MYM7O|5|The story line continued, true to the book series.  The most compelling characters remain Tyrian, Arya, Jon Snow and Daenerys;  the most irritating, Joffrey Lannister and Lord Baelysh.  The most complicated characters are  Robb Stark, Cerci Lannister and Jorah Mormont.<br /><br />I look forward to the Complete Third Season, and its successors.  I understand that the Fourth Season will contain elements of Books 3, 4 and 5.  This should make for an interesting blend.
B0087GF8ZG|5|I am very satisfied with the product, this is a good nightlight, it is not too bright, and the sensor is very sensitive, thus meaning the light work PERFECT. It is enough light to let you roam around on your way to the bathroom, Hence as mentioned the light stay on for about 8 seconds and switch off, but the slightest movement reactivates the light.
B000OT6V00|4|Opening WWII scene is absolutely amazing.  Guillermo del Toro is a film making genius.  A must see!<br /><br />B
B00CHSPB8Y|1|This game required too much data that I was willing to use,  This game would be  perfect, if it didn't require soon much data!
B00NEJ7MMI|5|This group is absolutely AWESOME and this CD is GREAT!  I listen to it all the time!  The price was right, and I can't wait to get more of their CD's!
B003MYYJD0|5|Arrived on time.<br />Perfect watch. Beautiful and elegant.<br />The gold color is similar a jowel.<br />Recomend this Product for all custumers
B000002BHE|3|I like Celine's Chart Toppers.  So I finally bought this CD.  Have listened to it several times trying to get into it but unfortunately I just couldn't.  I've decided that I like some of her songs, but just can't tolerate an entire CD.  Sorry!!  Maybe I just like rhythm too much, and she doesn't really  have it.  She is a ballad lady.

B00AYR2FOI|4|Just what one would expect, another sexy, soulful serving from a true master<br /><br />Turn the lights down low and listen up
B000002LGQ|5|For the first time Madonna makes a more serious record! Not only dance songs, but also very emotional ballads! This also is all about your family, friends and lovers and relationships. It includes a legendary song, Liek A Prayer. Just for that song u should buy this album. But there's much more. Buy this one, u won't be dissapointed!
B000031X7T|5|This album just blew me away. Play it loud!! All the music comes through clear as a bell!! The vocals were excellent. The Piano was awsome, it was like I was there. The music was staged perfectly from the drums to the keyboards to the guitars and vocals.<br />I have the Jap remix and this album blows it out of the water.<br />I have a fairly 'hi-end' system which I'm sure helps.<br />Anyways I loved this one far better than the rest.<br />The book is great, a true keeper.<br />Buzz
B008R3VLVO|5|I saw this movie years ago when it first came out and loved it then.  I remembered that I loved it, but didn't remember much else about the movie.  My husband suggested we watch it again last night and it was almost like seeing it for the first time.  So very much to love about this movie.  It's funny and sad and heartwarming.
B000NDMRCS|5|Action packed from the very beginning of the movie.  Love it.
B000IMUYJM|5|\\"Black Christmas\\" is an original, innovative holiday slasher flick that influenced countless imitations, including John Carpenter and Debra Hill's highly successful \\"Halloween.\\"  Directed by the versatile Bob Clark (director of the zombie horror hit \\"Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things\\" as well as the heartwarming family comedy \\"A Christmas Story\\"), \\"Black Christmas\\" is a  Canadian horror gem that has its own cult following and a website:  ItsMeBilly.com.  Though it never spawned a sequel, a successful remake was released in 2006.<br /><br />  The plot is chilling, suspenseful, and realistic.  A few days before Christmas, an unknown psychopath sneaks into the attic of a sorority house.  He makes obscene phone calls that terrify the residents.  One girl (Claire Harrison played by Lynne Griffin of \\"Curtains\\") is suffocated with a dry cleaning bag and her corpse seated in a rocking chair in the attic.  She remains there throughout the storyline, unknown to those below.<br /><br />  The viewer never sees the killer's face.  All we learn about him is that his name is Billy and he had a sister named Agnes.  He may have killed her.  Before killing a victim, he refers to her as \\"Agnes.\\"<br /><br />  The cast is great.  John Saxon (\\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\") is Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller who is investigating Claire's disappearance.  Olivia Hussey (\\"Psycho IV\\") is the pregnant heroine, Jessica Bradford, who is terrorized by her angry boyfriend, Peter Smythe (Keir Dullea).  Seventies scream queen Margot Kidder (\\"Sisters\\" and \\"The Reincarnation of Peter Proud\\") is the depressed alcoholic student, Barb Coard.  Art Hindle (of David Cronenberg`s \\"The Brood\\") is Claire's worried boyfriend, Chris Hayden.  Andrea Martin (\\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\") is the only actor to star in the 2006 remake.  Playing a student, Phyllis Carlson, in the original, Martin returns in the remake as the sorority housemother.<br /><br />  \\"Black Christmas\\" is a creepy, atmospheric horror slasher with a downbeat, open ending; it reminded me of the ending in \\"The House on Sorority Row.\\"  \\"Black Christmas\\" is a must see for fans of holiday slasher fare and slasher flicks in general.  It is definitely a holiday horror classic.  Watch it back to back with the remake for an interesting perspective on how horror films have evolved over the past thirty years.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!  And may all your Christmases be black!!!ding; it reminded me of the ending in \\"The House on Sorority Row.\\"  \\"Black Christmas\\" is a must see for fans of holiday slasher fare and slasher flicks in general.

0385484518|5|This book was presented to me by my 9th grade science teacher, whom it was given to by his brother. He told us to read it not because it had something to do with science but with life. That is his greatest goal as a teacher,to  get his point across that who ever you are, knowledge of life and morals  will apply to you. I'm very glad he did share it because it has inspired  change and revelation in my life. The book has taught me that you shouldn't  be ashamed of everyday things that happen to everyday people. This book is  definately on my Christmas list this year, every one should read this  book,even if you aren't a book person, I wasn't until I read this one. It's  an easy read and I urge everyone to acknowledge it and understand it as  well as I did!
B00871C09S|5|Daily Living has lots of weird things going on around us all.<br />This  movie has Love,,, Mystery,,& , suspects with odd behavior,..<br />A writer ( James Stewart ) , who writes document type stories ,, is  stuck  indoors to heal ,an injury.<br />He has loving friendships, and lots of time to Peek outside at the life of others..<br />As the days progress , he is wrapped up in ideas to help a missing woman.<br />Death,, is also possible,, With many changes & Hopes for good endings..
B00NQKWAIQ|5|Gave as a gift and they loved it.
B0002V7OI8|5|This is my favorite sci-fi movie -- well done in every way and so realistic that it's scary.....It COULD happen and therefore gives us much to think about -- for example, what is REALLY important in life!!
B007PKOKTK|4|It was a great movie and the picture was good and first it was cutting off but I restarted it and no more problems thanks
B00FNM3LGK|5|Chris Brown X is a awesome good CD ever, I like it alot...... Chris Brown fans get this awesome cool CD!
B001ECDVYK|5|Combared to every non Blu-Ray DVD I have seen this is as good as it gets at home.Its like having a 35mm copy to watch on your HD TV.Like me you may say it was made in Canada and have not seen a Blu-ray done by our friends in the North.All I can say is great job.    For the picky it has a DTS non HD however the DTS a good mix.   As with any good transfer the real color tones jump out at you from the opening scene.Detail is sharp through the whole movie.
B00688628M|5|btwn this and The Pacific, you don't need any other WWII drama-series. very well done, and intense
B000JMKTLO|5|I read this book fast, kept me interested!! Thank you for writing it and I'm going to read more of your books...if you have any.
B0026IUXME|1|Worst date movie ever, I thought it was going to be about pianos.
B003YWUTJI|2|I was excited to get a copy of this, from One2One Network, as I love her previous albums. I was a little disappointed in it though. I liked a few of the songs, but not many. Maybe upon listening to it again I'll hear something else I like, but it's not too likely.     I received a copy of the CD, in advance of it's release, from One2One Network in exchange for an honest review.
B00L23SE52|1|So bad
B002N14GPE|5|The actress did a terrific job.  No sure if she is really a victim of primordial dwarfism, but if not she sure is convincing.<br />A real mind bender.
B00RUT3902|3|I like this album a lot, with one major caveat. The production and mix are so murky sounding and bass-heavy that much of the time the lyrics are lost. It's a good thing that I already knew the lyrics to &#34;I'll Be Seeing You,&#34; for example, because I wouldn't have been able to understand most of them. The same goes for the new song, &#34;Last Song (for Lester)&#34; -- I tried to find the lyrics online, but no lyric site has them yet, because I suspect no one has been able to understand them well enough to transcribe them. It's a shame, because the arrangements of the Holiday standards are really interesting, and Wilson's voice sounds like velvet. I'm a huge Nick Cave fan, and I've liked Nick Launay's work with him, but Cave's deep male voice is better able to cut through the aural murk. If Launay had given Wilson's voice more presence so that the lyrics are more intelligible, I'd have given this five stars.
B003Q6D2B4|5|We must have missed this movie at the box office.  We saw it on TV and enjoyed it so much we bought a copy of our own to watch again.  This cast seemed to be having as much fun as we were watching it.  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and the incomparable Helen Mirren as you've never seen her before are all RED (retired, extremely dangerous) agents. Someone doesn't want them around anymore, and that's where the fun (and lots of violence) begins. Mary Louise Parker is the innocent who gets drawn into the middle of it all. This kept our interest and made us smile - it is nonstop thrills, nonstop fun and pure entertainment.  Buy it, pop some popcorn and sit back and enjoy a good time.  Then buy Red2 for their next adventure.
B00BD99JMW|5|Great book. I actually enjoyed how it ended, which apparently has some people upset. Glad I read this series and I recommend to anyone who likes fiction.
B00KA87GCW|5|Just started playing it again and am enjoying it . Been able to level up easily
B00ADR2DTG|4|This is a great little amp for the money.  The cooling fins are exposed so it is hot if you touch the wrong spots.  You will, however get dramatically better results with a different tube, which is why the design makes tube rolling so simple to do.  Playing GE 5670 preamp tubes into it after switching to the Electro-Harmonics 12AU7 EH, through ATH M-50s yields some pretty spectacular results.  For more punch, I use the OPA627 pre.  If you want accuracy, stick with solid state, but in terms of listening enjoyment, this thing is outstanding.
B00FKF0F3C|4|Good historical fiction. Reminds us of conflicts of 60&#34; s.  Runs out of steam in last third because subject is so vast. Should have been two books.
B009HUB40Y|5|I have a lot of fun playing. It can very challenging. But I enjoy the game a lot. I work and I don't get one sometimes till in evening.
B00BFUC8RC|4|The graphics are good and this game has smooth gameplay. Would love to see more games like this. I would recommend this game to anyone of my friends
0142413860|5|Bought it as a present for a friend's kid! He really enjoyed it, mostly because of the cd so that he could listen while looking at the wonderful drawings!
0446310786|5|Cheap!
1401216676|5|Must Read. For any DC Fan or Any Joker Fan.<br />If you are literate read this
B004Z7AHZC|5|Great
0399159347|5|I simply could not put this book down! When I finished it, I found myself somewhat depressed.  I wanted it to go on and on.  I wanted to continue reading about the characters.  Ms. Moriarty has mastered the skill of character development.  The epilogue was the cherry on top.  I am an avid reader and this will be a story I won't soon forget. I highly recommend this book!  I will be reading more of her work in the near future; and the depression at the end of a great novel is worth the joy of a well written story!! Order it now, you will thank me later!
B00EY8A6BC|2|I love to disagree with the critics, but with this movie I can't. While the movie was action packed, the storyline was predictable and the resolution was unsatisfying.
B00BN3EE1O|5|This is a wonderful movie especially since it was filmed in my birthplace Southport NC<br />Amazing Makes me miss my family there
B0080SZ0V8|4|EASY to complex puzzless, great as an escape to beat the heat or rain. Great graphics.<br />Not so challenging that you get frustrated.
B00NEJ7MMI|5|Great music to play on my School bus for the kids. Easy to listen to.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is awesome. Defenant recommend.=^¥ As soon as I downloaded it I couldn't get off. It's so addicting. Thank you to the creators of Minion Rush.
B00421IR5I|5|My coworker showed this many years in a row and my students BEG me to show it to them again. It is appropriate to show in school and many lessons can be created using it. I have not yet had the chance to show my students, as our film policy has changed once again, but I hope to show it again in the future, or at least show it during French club,
B00CQZ65SI|5|Nicely written------- Good dietary advice for anyone and everyone.... A very interesting struggle and success story. Very, very well done.
B0043WDK2G|5|Loved season 3.  Can't argue with the majestry of the writing , directing and acting.  Bravo to the cast and crew!
B000N6U0E2|5|Excellent story though LOOSELY based on fact.  Well acted.
B007SGM084|4|Kept me reading through the first two books.... I couldn't put it down!  The story could've ended there. The third book has some slow spots and becomes very predictable. It seems to end and then has afterthought which follows. It feels awkward to me but overall a very good read.
B003TJR2HS|5|I bought this to use with my JBL on stage player, it has a firewire connector which will not fit iphone 4,4s needing a 30 pin adaptor.<br />this allows me to listen to the player and it also charges my phone,  just what I needed.
B004MC8CA2|5|The app is very user friendly. It has multiple translations and it also offers on or offline options. Very useful
B005K17RU0|4|only thing I would change is seeing today's high and low in a more convenient place. other than that, its great. love how it looks.
B0094BB4TW|1|Crashes when loading. Get message that it stopped working do you want to close. I would give it a big fat zero, if I could.
B00006879E|5|love the cd
B000001Y9I|5|Great cd at a great price. Excellent
B00AKEMHCA|2|I LOVE RHE GAME BUT I LOGED IN AND I WAS BACK AT LEVEL 1 when I was rank 41 FIX PLEASE!!!!!!
B005HED1BE|5|This is better then the watching it on TV and all those commercials!!!I wish Amazon would get the original Outer Limits in the prime section!!Some of the other 60's TV shows also,like Combat,12 O'clock High,Mission Impossible and etc.
B000ICXQXI|4|School work project
B009CF3MEK|5|I think the great american novel has been written and it is The Great Gatsby. This movie is a very true rendition of the book.  The music, by Nelson Riddle, keeps coming back to me.  The party scenes are a must to see as an evocation of the 1920's. The casting is very successful.  Even though Redford seems a little old for Gatsby , his portrayal of a man wanting to recapture a long lost love is adept.  I don't know who could have been better at playing the parts done by Dern, Black, and Farrow.  This movie is a treat, to be enjoyed over and over.
B0094BB4TW|5|Keeps me in touch with all my friends and family no matter where they are scattered around the world...
B0007TKNIS|5|If you want a movie full of action, drama, a good love/life story and some fantastic music that will make you shiver, this is the flick for you.
B0045HCJ6M|5|The first time I saw Camelot with Richard Harris was a stage production on TV, it was wonderful!! I Love this movie.
B007C4ZJ3K|5|Spy flicks are usually a mixed bag, some good, some great, some ok and some just plain awful, usually if a good cast and director are involved more often than not they fall under the great or at least good category. \\"Haywire\\" has director Steven Soderbergh (\\"Traffic\\" and \\"Ocean's Eleven\\") at the helm who brings his talents to an otherwise typical story of a black-ops agent named Mallory (Gina Carano, Former MMA Star) who rescues a hostage and is given a job that leads to her being (gasp) betrayed by someone close to her.<br /><br />So naturally she must fight back and use her training and skills to find out who betrayed her and well take them out for lack of a better word. Since this is her first major film role, its good that Soderbergh put together an all-star supporting cast with her. Among them are Ewan McGregor (The new \\"Star Wars\\" Trilogy), Antonio Banderas (\\"The Mask of Zorro\\" and \\"Shrek 2\\"), Bill Paxton (\\"Twister\\" & \\"Frailty\\"), Michael Douglas (\\"Basic Instinct\\" & \\"The Sentinel\\") and others really add some pep to this flick.<br /><br />The music by David Holmes also really fits the movie, its stylish and really soothing and also jolting when it has to be but it doesn't overpower the movie. The story while simple is well done thanks to the layered cast, the previously mentioned music, Soderbergh's direction and to me Carano shines here as she's not given way too much to do but looks equal parts tough and very, very beautiful. I literally couldn't take my eyes off of her throughout the movie.<br /><br />Is it a perfect movie? No of course not, but it is quite fun and really helped out by all the good parts involved. *** out 4 stars.
B00992CF6W|5|Fun exciting can't get bored mobs bring the life to it
B00KW1TGDE|4|Durable outside IF protected by a cover or inside the light fixture, but all of them stop working if not protected. Provides good light and works well.
B00000ITOY|5|Bought this for my now two year old's first birthday and it's been a hit along with the plan toys sorting cone. Good montessori style toys that teach colors, shapes and good hand eye coordination and motor skills. It's nice to give my son toys that make him think rather than plastic loud toys that think for him. These toys entertain all his little friends of different ages too. I watch my son while he plays, and I'm glad we gave him these at age 1.
B00H71PHS0|5|The season began with a slow start.  However, with the tragic ending of season 3 and Matthew's death, this was probably expected and my curiosity was peaked.  We have not watched the final episode of season 4 but the writer has taken the viewer into several different directions with various characters.  What will happen to Edith and her decision about her baby.  Where will Rose's  mischievous behavior take her, will Mr. Bates be in trouble with the law again, will Mary and Tom save Downton Abbey from financial ruin, what will Mary decide about her two suitors, and will Tom make a political stand.  The Dowager and Matthew's mother are always interesting.  Season 4 makes me eager to continue the saga.  I'm enthralled with the story, characters, setting, and period of time in which the story takes place.
B001UHOWXI|5|Almost 70 years after its release, this is still one of the greatest movies ever made and is my favorite.  This is an absolutely magical story that helps anyone who watches it to remember what actually matters in life.  It's a Wonderful Life is the most uplifting and wonderful movie that I've ever seen.
B00DJFIMW6|5|It is awesome it's like temple run but better<br /><br />U could get new places from running to a certain distance.
B00594XOZU|4|This app worked really well for me because everything worked and since I don't have a smartphone this is a perfect for texting on my kindle and not just my phone
B00DJFIMW6|3|I thought this game was overall excellent, but was very sensitive. A example is if I tried to move to the next lane, it would make my character roll. Excellent graphics too.
B000BH4YFE|5|This one of my favorite T. Rex albums.  I never get tired of this material.  I have been listening to this album for over 30 years now and it's still rocks!  This two disc set is just great.  I love everything about it.  The packaging, the essay about the album, but most of all, the music.  Bolan was on a roll.  The sound on this is the best yet, I had second thoughts about buying this for the third time, but I am glad I did. The sound beats any of the previous issues of this album.  The first CD I bought of this album in 1986, made in France, had more bonus tracks, these were singles issued around the same time as the album.  Fortunately these are on The Wax Singles, A's & B's 1972-77, so I haven't missed any of this great material.  The second disc titled \\"Rabbit Fighter\\" is a very nice compliment to the album.  Almost the entire album in alternate takes and mixes.  This and \\"Electric Warrior\\" are two of the best of all time.  A must have, especially for T. Rex fans.
B004W2UBYW|5|Amazing story.  I don't believe there is a person in the last 1000 years who, in almost every way, was such a study in contrast...  An indisputable genius/ mind-numbing poor decision maker.  One of the greatest \\"idea man\\" of all time/one of the worst \\"idea man\\" of all time.  Emotional/emotionless  No one besides maybe Henry Ford could get a group of people to produce so much in a short time/ yet he himself held up productivity to the point of madness.  Fantastic designer/products often failed due to poor design  I could go on. It is truly fascinating to read this man's story. This guy could employ an entire floor of psychiatrist for generations to try and explain his psychological makeup.  Amazing
B00F8F3J2S|5|It'a always good to see insiders tell the inside scoop.  If the current admin doesn't like it, that gives credibility.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Great read!
B00E8KLWB4|5|Love this game!  great even without wi-fi.
B00AREIAI8|5|This game is fun and very addicting you want to never leave your horse it's a fun game to play and when I hear my horse I think of this game
B004LROUNG|5|It took me forever to read this book because I had so many outside things going on I just could not  stay awake long enough to read at night.  But, I finally finished and I am glad I did.  It was a good book.
B00BAXFACO|4|This story had all the twists and turns you expect from a Michael Connelly novel. The loses Mickey Haller faces in this one really help build the flawed, good guy with an attitude character even further. I enjoyed it.

B007PT3QOQ|5|I really enjoy this game on my kindle fire. the only thing I'm annoyed about was that I bought extra dollars and had to restore my fire and my progress and dollars disappeared. besides that its very fun and addicting.
B001EBV0K8|1|This movie was horrible compared to the first Matrix. Somewhere along the line this \\"trilogy\\" went from thoughtful science fiction to mindless action and special effects. Avoid.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Big fan of hidden object games
B00GTCECVG|5|Amazing game
B006PHD0RW|3|a cute game is you are bored. ;)
B005LAIHZY|5|came quickly!  great black friday price!  cute story! My 2 and 3 year olds can sit and watch this all the way though, and dad and I like to watch this one with them!
B00EOARZ4G|5|Man - I am hoping that the Ryan series does not go into oblivian because of the passing of Tom Clancy!!
B00015YVD6|5|I had been looking in stores for over a year for the movie SPLASH and couldn't findit. Waisted much time digging through the movie bins, never could find it. I decided to look online and found it reasonably priced on Amazon.com and ordered it. It was here within a week and with shipping and the price of the dvd, it was UNDER $10. I would order again.    :)
B0093ST02E|1|I watched this movie because a friend told me she liked it.  I thought it was boring, moved slowly, very odd, and just not worth the time it took to watch.  I like the actors, just not in this movie.
B004LUHQ1G|5|Foo Fighter did not disappoint me!  I enjoyed the entire album. Several songs will be on my all time favorite Foo Fighter songs.

B00028HBKM|5|I normally don't write reviews of movies since I don't go to see many of them because they are usually such nonsensical Hollywood crap. But after reading a couple hundred reviews of this DVD, I couldn't resist adding my two cents. <br />I did see the movie when it first came out, and I bought several copies of the DVD for myself and family members because it is truly a transformational piece of artistry and guidance of how to conduct your life for the short time we get to inhabit the planet. Most of the comments I read did not actually deal with the importance of Gibson's contribution to civilization.  <br />Jesus was an important contributor to the advancement of civilization because he did something that is so rare in human events. He was willing to die for changing a corrupt world and make it more loving, accepting, and inclusive.  Religion has always been a force for good and evil because it is used by those who want to advance their own agenda rather than that of the originator of a particular religion. This is true whether the focus was worshiping fire, water, cows, snakes, a human individual, and many other idols. Humans are different from our fellow apes because we actually try to understand the unknowable of why we are here, and what we should do in guiding us now that we are capable of more than just sitting around a fire cooking the day's catch.  Muhammad's words are used as an excuse for jihad by lunatics who kill randomly and wantonly to advance their view of the Koran to kill any \\"nonbelievers\\". The high priests of the temple of David were threatened by a \\"blasphemer\\" when he pointed out the violation of having money changers in the temple. The high priests in Spain and medieval Europe roasted other \\"blasphemers\\" in violation of the words of the Christ they supposedly worshiped as their God. <br />What Gibson does with his work is to point out that we all have a choice, actually many choices in life, to choose the path of forgiveness and love of our fellow man, regardless of how they have violated any sense of humanity towards our fellow man, or go the way of Rome at the time of Jesus (or Berlin and Moscow in the 30's and 40's). It is really the only thing that makes us different from our ancestors who climbed down from the trees millions of years ago and moved all over the planet. I find it especially telling that those who watch something like the \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" and don't feel a need to write a review about such gratuitous violence can give a one star to a movie which is focused on the horrible suffering of scourging and crucifixion two millennia ago of someone who preached honesty, love, compassion, forgiveness, and inclusiveness when the ruling order of the day was sacrificing goats for signs of divine guidance.  <br />This is one of the real classics of movie making. It is not for the faint of heart, because dying for the sins of your fellow man is a rare event. No other major religion is based upon such a selfless individual. It is why it has transformed the world from one of Conan the barbarian and his predecessors and successors to one where we think of something other than ourselves and our selfish human passions. Of course humans being humans, the forces of evil are on the march, as exemplified by the suicide bombings in Israel, Ossetia, New York, Washington, Bali, Kenya, Tanzania, Yemen, Germany, etc.  <br />Gibson deserves every dime he was rewarded with for reminding us of the transformational nature of the message of Jesus the Jew to mankind. Whether you think of Jesus as the Christ or not, you cannot find a better advocate for all the principles that we take for granted today in the West, including those on the upper West Side or West Hollywood who have never done anything but shoot their mouths off while hundreds of thousands have given their blood and bodies for mankind. Every time I walk among the thousands of crosses in American cemeteries all over Europe, and especially in places like Normandy, where brave young men gave their lives, not for conquest or commercial gain but so that others could be free, I understand their sacrifice and the appropriateness of marking it with the symbol of what Christ did to inspire all of mankind. This movie shows you how it all started and what a magnificent gift of selflessness it was.  <br />
1250038820|5|I LOVE THIS BOOK!  everybody has a story and they are all worth hearing :)
B000002V0Q|5|A great album.  Not the thrash that Megadeth excelled at previously, but still great music with  heavy riffs, and lightning fast, precise solos.  There isn't a bad song on the album, though it does drop off a bit at the  end.  The best songs on the album (Skin O' My Teeth, Symphony of  Destruction, This Was My Life, Foreclosure of a Dream, Countdown to  Exctinction) are classic Megadeth.  This is probably my favorite Megadeth  album, but it's hard to compare with the previous albums because of the  difference in style.   Mustaine said that Megadeth would make an album  better than Metallica's Black Album, and he suceeded with this one.
B00IIUATDM|5|I thought this was an excellent movie. Leonardo DiCaprio never ceases to amaze me with his acting. Great supporting cast as well.
B0050DZN4K|5|I am now used to open this app every morning to get a quick review of fresh news. You may choose your own selection. Having the chance to look at beautiful photographs early in the morning makes you happy for the whole day!
B000FBFN1U|5|Somewhere in book two the story started to drag, but so much happens and shifts in the second half of the third book that it reignited my interest in the series. Well done and worth the wait.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Candy crush is a very cool game. Plus my kids get a big kick out of it! We all love it!

0316069906|4|Very informative even for omnivores! We should all be more knowledgable about what we put into our bodies. Safran-Foer presents an accessible and interesting overview of the food industry without being preach-y. A definite must-read.
B00004XONN|5|DARK SIDE OF THE MOON for the new millenium.  This one will be remembered twenty years from now.

B005MMJ84K|5|I really enjoyed this series.  Such an interesting story and easy to read.  I really like how this author describes everything with such imagery.  I will definitely read more of her books.
B00DPM7TIG|5|A beautiful story, excellently told . . . both tragic and uplifting much like the times in which it is set.
B003VANOFY|2|When it works, it works amazing, however it constantly cuts out for 5 seconds when I'm in the middle of gaming.
B00TEAVEY8|4|So happy this game is finally available on my Kindle!! I LOVE this game. I think it's better than most of the other games in this category. Just wish it didn't take so much energy to search a crime scene. Other than that, it's great! You can def play and enjoy this one without having to buy anything extra! A truly FREE game!!

0800141660|5|... the romantic, Mariane Dashwood (Kate Winslet), exclaims to her wary younger sister Margaret while walking up a grassy hill on a windy day while the dark clouds of approaching rain hover nearby.  So goes a scene from \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", Emma Thompson and Ang Lee's adaptation of the Jane Austen classic.  The story, which takes place early 1800's England, focuses on the Dashwood sisters, Marianne, about 16 years old, and her older sister Eleanor, played by Emma Thompson.   <br /> <br />After their father dies, the Dashwood family, including the mother and the three sisters lose their fortune and begin to embark upon a more modest life, being forced to move from their estate to a relative's \\"snug\\" cottage. <br /> <br />The film, in essence, follows Eleanor and Marianne as they are thrown into love with their likely and unlikely suitors,  the humble and slightly bumbling, Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), the dashing John Willoughby (Greg Wise) and the tormented yet dependable Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).  Another key element is the loving bond between the two sisters. <br /> <br />From the sweeping and lush English countryside to the historic streets of London, we see the two young women experience infatuation, passion, heartbreak, patience, wisdom, and finally, love.  Emma Thompson's screenplay is both funny and touching, sometimes pointing out how the times were hard for women.  She does not follow the book religiously but does an amazing job in capturing the essence of the Dashwood girls and their struggle to live a full life amidst their limitations of both class and sex.   <br /> <br />The sets and the exterior scenery are beautiful, the acting amazing throughout the entire cast (including a younger yet still brooding Hugh Laurie).  It sounds like a cliche but it's true, you will laugh, cry and fall in love through the eyes of the Dashwood sisters.
B00005QFE5|5|This is the first film (not TV) that Zhang Ziyi made (at the age of 19 or 20) playing the part of 16/18. It is not a \\"action\\" film but it is one of her best.  After seeing \\"The Road Home\\" I had to \\"google wikipedia\\" for a list of all her films and am presently working thru all of Zhang Ziyi, Gong Li, Maggie Cheung, and Michelle Yeoh's films. If you want to see a \\"Real Love Story\\" this is the film to see. I only wish that \\"The Road Home\\" film had been longer. I regretted to see it end
B0000025JT|5|All went well.
B007REV4T8|3|Enjoy the new bond series; Quantum of Solace, Casino Royale, and Skyfall. Daniel Craig and this series bring a darker edge to Bond's character missing since Sean Connery.
B00DLKXF3A|5|I purchased this CD as a gift to my husband.  He will be attending Avenged Sevenfold latest tour and thought this would be perfect!  He loved it!!!
B007J4T2G8|3|This book was unique in it's content and means of story telling. I was prepared for some explicit scenes but instead received what seamed like a weird fettish by an uber hot guy with a messed up world that draws you into the story. Made me want to see what came next.
B005FNJL7K|5|This is a really good &#34;concise&#34; version of all three soundtracks.
B00006LLNU|3|I bought this cd based on the recommendation by this website.  Before I start my thoughts, let me say im not a fan of conventional music, i like more the radiohead and flaming lips kind of music, and I also put very little value on the words of songs.  This cd isnt for those who care about lyrics, because you cant understand and there is no lyrics in the album booklet.  But lyrics dont concern.  The music is extremely simplistic, and I dont mean just the fact that only a few instruments play at a time, it doesnt matter.  The chord progressions though are that of most the songs you hear on the radio.  I guess people take it as being something special since there's synthesizers replacing electric guitars.  I think theres alot better music out there than this, if you want something good get Yoshimi battles the pink robots by the flaming lips.  Theres a great cd, this cd is only ok at best.
B00CLT31D6|5|Very good book! The millionaire next door is alive and well!
B004MC8CA2|5|I love that there are many versions and reading plans available.  This app made it possible for me to FINALLY complete an entire year's reading plan. I have it on all of my electronic devices. Good stuff! Thanks!
0307891372|5|Simply put, this guide is amazing. There's over 600 pages of very informative information, from main quests to side quests, and everything in between. When I say everything, I mean everything. If you want to take the full advantage of playing Skyrim, do yourself a favor and buy this guide. You won't be disappointed. I'll just add here that I normally do not bother buying guides, as I can easily find anything out from the internet. However, if you plan on putting 150+ hours into Skyrim, you will find things to be much easier and more fun if you get this strategy guide. Also, it makes a great christmas gift with the game.
B00ESY77LO|4|I stayed awake almost all the way through it.  That makes it a winner in my mind.  It was a real improvement over the 1970's version.
B007JM4CWY|5|Pros:  lots of fun...quite a number of puzzles to solve. Each doesn't take much time.  No real math or language skills required. I would imagine that people who like games like sudoku would like this. Honestly I probably won't have gotten it for 4.95 before I tried it. But after trying it, I would buy.<br /><br />Not sure if you can reset completed puzzles so that someone else can play.<br /><br />Cons:  Would be nice if there was a timer so you can see how long you take or compete on time.  Also something to keep in mind- not the games fault, but my tablet is smaller so I often hit the wrong square and need to undo.  This is sometimes frustrating and probably worse for people with bigger fingers.
B00CHSPB8Y|5|This game is a great game. I love how it tests your reflexes and how fast you can shoot or get out of the way of the obstacles.
B000000WJZ|5|Perhaps one of the most intricate, poignant, and utterly striking albums ever made. Siamese Dream's grasp on the listener is two-fold, as it is astonishingly impressive not only in its magnatude but also its purity. Billy Corgan communicates to the world through shear beauty. The univesality of the record allows it easily to become a sort of sountrack and anthem to your every day life. Siamese Dream isn't listened to, its experienced.
B002ZG9940|5|To me, this movie is terrific,  but I understand the negative reviews. The movie is not for everyone. It's deliberately paced to put it mildly,  but I was entranced the whole time and found the retro style of filmmaking refreshing. The final moments of this film are haunting. Clooney is terrific, and the European locales are awesome. I love Bourne style frenetic action as much has anyone,  but this is just a different sort of film that is just as good.
B003U8BTCW|4|creepy good
B002MQYOFW|5|I am quite suspicious of my son's recomendations for good reads, (he is  in his 20's, I am much older). So, I took it with a grain of salt when he said, \\"...trust me...\\". I quit reading it after chapter 1 (maybe it was chapter 2), I was already too unnerved. My son said, \\"no, read a little further...\\" I did, as fast as I possible could, downloaded the second and third book as fast as I possibly could, wow! What a story! I then ordered it for my other son, (through the mail) and can't wait for the movie! (I, who am into only serious and mature reading, silly me!) A must read for anyone who enjoys fabulous writing and imagination, and the unfolding of a great story!
B0084AZXKK|5|Adventure after adventure presented through the eyes and mind of a boy.  Well written.  Some of the language used may not be appropriate for today's &#34;politically correct&#34; world, but certainly fits the era depicted.  Great plot!  Exciting!  Difficult to put down.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Great read!  John Grisham does it again!!!
B0019UGYK0|5|As many reviewers have noted, \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" is an absolute milestone of anti-establishment cinema.  The performances are nuanced and powerful, the on-location shooting resonates with heat and oppression, and the story and characters exude archetypal impact.  The reviewers who claim that the \\"moral\\" of this film is that people should not assert individuality in prison clearly have no understanding of the word \\"allegory,\\" because in a symbolic sense, the exact point of the film is that the existence of the human spirit depends upon asserting individuality in the face of brutal, institutionally-backed conformity.  As a systematic, hard-headed noncomformist, Newman's Luke is purposefully cast as a savior figure--which is why he's photographed via the iconography of crucifixion after the egg-eating contest, for example--and reviewers who take his character to task for rebelling against the system completely miss the point and go a long way toward demonstrating the very problem the movie works to expose.
B00005JA8B|5|love it
B00881VLCE|3|Fun puzzles, but regularly have to restart my kindle for the game to open properly. It might open twice in a row, it might not. Once it loads, it seems to work just fine. Also wish it came with more free puzzles.
B00AREIAI8|3|I got this app for my little sister to play, since she's a bit of a horse fan. She loved the game at first, but she got bored with it pretty quickly. But overall, it seems like a pretty good game for young horse lovers.
B002V091IO|5|I absolutely loved this book. I became a big fan of Nicholls with his first novel (A Question of Attraction -- originally titled \\"Starter for Ten\\" with its U.K. edition.) I was a little letdown by his second -- The Understudy, which was fun, but not quite as good as his first. This book exceeds his first. He takes a great device -- following the lives of one couple on the same day over a period of 20 years -- and does a masterful job of storytelling with it. We go from the couple's idealistic college days -- they meet on the day of their graduation -- all the way into their late 30s, with all the physical and emotional changes that come during that timespan. We see the career missteps along the way, and all the various relationships they have while still remaining friends -- and the woman, Emma, always secretly in love with Dexter Mayhew, who has more than a few wild oats to sow before he realizes the woman he should be with is the one who's always been his best friend. The writing is absolutely marvelous. The dialogue is absolutely terrific -- the couple have a teasing/kneedling way of talking to each other and the reparteee between them remains funny and fresh throughout even though the novel is long -- 435 pages.<br /><br />To say much more would be to give too much away. But if you like insightful books about relationships that can touch all of your emotions, this is the book for you. I think structurally the way Nicholls manages to take you on an extraordinary trip from the first page to the very last is a tour de force.<br /><br />I had to buy this from amazon/uk because it was available in Britain a year before it became available in the United States, but I'm so happy I got it. This is definitely a book I will re-read several times -- and I hope Nicholls continues to have a prolific career.
B00CWY76CC|5|This game is challenging and fun and a good time waster.
B00CL0J99K|5|I am gonna keep this short and sweet so I don't lose you. I don't know why so many people hated this movie. Yeah I will admit the ending didnt please me to much. It would have if I knew it was the end of iron man but I know he will be in the avengers 2. And maybe another ironman movie. It was a really enjoyable movie. It did what I was expecting an ironman movie to do. Make me laugh (Funniest ironman movie yet). Had some great action. And brought back my favorite super hero and actor. The one thing that did disappoint me though is that their wasn't one ac/dc song in this.And one last thing I want to say to close. Bandwagon mandarin fans. Get over it!!!!
B00J9APGGA|5|My wife loves this doll.  She collects Maleficent items.
B008Y768XO|1|Couldn't get to see the movie.  I would watch for 10 seconds then it would stream for approx 55 seconds.  This happened from start of movie until I got fed-up... about 10 minutes...!!!
B000HKW7E0|5|A wonderful movie. The Griswold family antics are a joy to watch, and there's even a moral. A must watch Christmas movie.
B000060P79|1|Ok, Simple Plan, is simply don't buy it. They may play their own instruments, but that doesn't mean they are great. Their album names are lame and not creative at all. it sucks, really. there are so many other bands out there to listen too. i don't seem enthralled with this band, i don't think they have much to work with. also they play on TRL so much, which is not such a acomplishment. They aren't really that 'punk-rock'.. come on. with those dumb titles?! really, get serious. real punk rockers would puke all over this. they'd be ashamed. if you like them, well you do, but i sure don't. check out other bands, and maybe you'll find this CD, eventually.. getting to the back of that shelf of yours.
1594633665|5|A must read Finished in one day
B00GCE3TCE|5|Could not put it down!
0792844890|4|Mel Brooks definitely lives up to expectations with Spaceballs. This parody of the Star Wars movies will deliver laughs whether you are a sci fi fan or not. The cast of characters (including Bill Pullman, John Candy, and Rick Moranis...and of course Mel Brooks) closely parallels the familiar cast of Star Wars, but Rick Moranis takes the cake as Dark Helmet, the Darth Vader-like figure. (&quot;And now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.&quot;)<br />Personally, I found this movie amusing at 10, and now at 22 I still think it's wonderful. Most of the other reviews give you an idea of what the movie contains, so I won't get into a long explanation, but I have to recommend this one pretty highly as a great comedy.
B001F6TXME|5|A must have to every DSLR holder.
B003NFM3JU|5|The 3D video was fantastic! The quality was absolutely excellent! Service from Amazon was the usual fine effort on their part. I'm very pleased and would recommend the 3Dversion to anyone.
B005ZOBNOI|4|funny, sad, honest. fearless and soulful. do not be afraid of the truth. sometimes it's what we most need to hear
0812548094|5|These books are must read.  They are adult fairy tales and take you to wonderful places.  The book was in terrific condition and I enjoyed it so much.  Thank goodness for Amazon!
B005Q1W10A|5|great story
B00A85EMVK|3|I was very happy when I first read this was coming out in 3d and when I got it home I was so disappoined  by what I saw the video was not very clear and looked very old not very good in HD wish I had went to see it in the theater so I would not have wasted my money
B009ZQC7MY|5|Once again, as with so many series in the past, the British have created a marvelous drama filled with intrigue, humor, romance and a sense of history.  Bravo!
B009IH0ICG|4|good

B0007OY2MG|5|I purchased Season Three to complete my adult daughter's collection of all the seasons of The Gilmore Girls.  I have been watching it myself;  I never watched it when it was on TV.  It is wonderful!  It is filled with quirky characters and a dialogue that is fast, sometimes funny and full of cultural references.  I recommend starting with Season One and working your way through all the seasons.
B005GFPZYK|4|No question that Chris Kyle was ideal soldier, but the book was as if written by<br />a high school student. I appreciate that he was a lover of country and reportedly<br />a fearer of God, and was a killing machine, and perfect for Iraq, but I would have<br />expected the ghost writer/collaborator could have produced a better literary product.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Nice product
B00BEJL3IY|4|I liked this film and together with my 12 years old daughter we spend a nice moment watching it. It is however definitely not recommended to little children, like 10 and younger. This rfeview contains limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />This retelling of old tale of Jack and the Beanstalk is pretty well done, with many key ingredients of fairy tales well in place. There is a brave and ultimately quite clever farm boy (Jack), a cute and quite likeable damsel in distress, a noble king, his brave knights, a vilainous treacherous scoundrel, powerful magic items, a really REALLY BAD giant alpha (and beta) and a whole batallion of other giants, almost as dangerous as their two-headed leader.<br /><br />Past the first 10 minutes, the film is rather quick paced and visually it is very pleasant: the sky domain of giants, the giant beanstalks and the mighty royal fortress are really impressive. The desperate fight of royal army against the giants besieging the great royal castle is a particularly well done thing - I certainly appreciated that both humans and giants fight in a rather logical way and human army is definitely not a push-over...<br /><br />The best character in the film and a scene stealer is Elmont, a sarcastic noble knight commanding royal guard, played very VERY convincingly by Ewan McGregor who seizes this occasion to remind the public, that he once played Obi-wan Kenobi and that after all he killed Darth Maul and General Grievous and defeated and mutilated Darth Vader... Frankly, I almost expected Elmont to finally use his light-saber and I was very surprised when he didn't...<br /><br />Stanley Tucci who plays the main villain Roderick is another scene stealer, with his quasi Monty Pythonesque style - it is clear he had tons of fun playing in this film. Ewan Bremer, who plays his slightly deranged murderous sidekick Wicke, is another delight to watch.<br /><br />Compared to those three characters and to all the gallery of giants, both Jack and the Princess seem a little pale - this is the reason I give this film only four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Children younger than 11 can find this film TOO SCARY, as there are numerous scenes when giants EAT PEOPLE - and even if there is no gore and everything happens fast and is shown in some distance, the scenes are explicit enough to leave no doubt that a character had just his head and shoulders ripped of the rest of his body and swallowed by a enormous, ugly, very strong, very fast and very agressive monster.<br /><br />But bottom line, I liked this film and I spend a good moment watching it - and I think we will buy the DVD when it is available. Although not a masterpiece, this is a nice, easy, visually very impressive film.little pale - this is the reason I give this film only four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Children younger than 11 can find this film TOO SCARY, as there are numerous scenes when giants EAT PEOPLE - and even if there is no gore and everything happens fast and is shown in some distance, the scenes are explicit enough to leave no doubt that a character had just his head and shoulders ripped of the rest of his body and swallowed by a enormous, ugly, very strong, very fast and very agressive monster.<br /><br />But bottom line, I liked this film and I spend a good moment watching it - and I think we will buy the DVD when it is available.

0007165013|5|I loved this book, it's written in such an original way. The story is amazing that two people can remain best friends for so many years even though they're seperated by an ocean. I love it, absoultely love it!!
B001N26GFM|5|I have developed an interest in this particular period of history and some years ago gave a speech on the subject of the Holocaust. I have an intimate and wide ranging   knowledge of the atrocities committed during this time; but nothing , no documentary, no book, no article, no personal recollection has had a more profound affect upon me. This film tore me apart and I am so glad that someone had the vision to write the book and bring it to the screen. This is uniquely wonderful film and I wonder whether I will see the like of it again. You do not so much watch this film, as feel it, as you walk in Bruno's steps. An experience I will never forget and am grateful to have had.
B008Y212PI|4|I can not wait to go to more challenging puzzles I am really enjoying it  I can't put it down
B008476HBM|5|It was thought provoking and an easy read.<br /><br />Much funnier than I expected, in a very dry fashion.<br /><br />The women of consequence are strong vibrant characters.
B00AWQEKIK|5|We love this album.  A complete comprehensive collection of Stephen Stills, with the radio cuts and specials that I don't know where we would have heard them.  Love!!
B00HQI7VMY|5|The year maybe 1992 but the audio and video on this blu ray cannot be any better. Amazingly it was very clear and the audio was just simply superb. The legendary casts appearing in this video really brings back nostalgic feelings of days gone by but not easily forgotten. A great blu ray in my collection and Im sure you will love it too.
0553801473|2|I start this off by saying that if anyone goes into this book thinking anything significant is going to happen in the greater scheme of the plot, then YOU KNOW NOTHING [insert name].<br /><br />I think anyone who has any experience with the last couple books Martin has given us pretty much gets it by now that we have morphed into a kind of soap opera where there is lots of drama but the overall story goes nowhere. Much like in General Hospital, most of the characters are transitory. They come in, they go out, they come back again, but usually never leave for good unless you are a Stark. Of the Starks, they are almost forgotten, as it has been so long, we have heard so little from them, and they have so little influence on the plot.<br /><br />The series has been trending towards an unending \\"now\\" and this book has been worst of all in that respect. The sheer number of characters is staggering. I almost have an adverse physical reaction every time he introduces another one. Even in a huge book like this, one hears little from many of them and nothing from more (get it? many and more?). This book also manages to capture the \\"long-thought-dead character appears\\" vibe that you get in daytime soaps.<br /><br />Unfortunately, also like a soap opera, there is very little action (again, worst in the series in that regard). No kidding, pulse raising moments are very few and really far between.  You had better be in this for the experience as this plot moves s-l-o-w-l-y.<br /><br />I was so glad to be rid of Jon Snow (assuming we are really rid of him) as his story line was absolutely glacial (no reference to the Wall intended). No kidding, a great deal of the book was dedicated to his character but aside from meaningless dialogues with a horde of other characters I could care less about, NOTHING happened.<br /><br />If you are ok with all this, it is not a horrible book. Many of the characters are actually engaging and the world that Martin created is still compelling. The prose is ok, but not as good as it used to be.  Lots of repeating stock phrases that were once clever, overuse of new vocabulary words (Martin must have learned \\"Leal\\" while studying for the SAT or something) and lots of bad language used in an unimaginative manner (e.g. \\"the queen commands you to #$%@ her\\" seriously?, we waited how long for this?).<br /><br />On the good side, Martin never fails to amaze me with his ability to express human suffering and barbaric behavior.<br /><br />For people who have not started plowing through this series, don't start. Stick to the HBO TV series. For those already bought in, go ahead and read the book (use the Library if you can as I doubt you will pick it up again). Just know that the farther this thing goes on the more complicated it will get and the slower it will move.<br /><br />Great example of an average author who had a flash of brilliance long ago and has successfully milked while drifting back into mediocraty.
0071752854|5|Although this book is similar to others it presents a totally new avenue of applying it. Owen give you outlined areas in the book that you can use to apply it to whatever your industry is. I really like that as I have little to no imagination when it comes to being clever. I also like the fact that he does not agree with hard selling and can show you how to get your point across by being nice and funny without having to sound like you walked out of the 80's.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to do presentations to keep people engaged. I will be reading this book more then once to get it all down pat.
B0013TXA5Y|3|I bought the book because I saw the movie and I am of the belief that the book is always better.  This time I was wrong.  The characters were not well developed and the ages of the characters were not portrayed realistically.  I felt the writing was lazy.  Too many things were taken from other popular stories. The history of the story was not well developed.  I was disappointed.I wanted to like this book so much.  I will not be reading anything else from this author.
B009ZQC7MY|5|The writers are of excellent quality ,astute in the era ,bring color fashion ; mystery , drama and a flare of jovial moments. The stars are superb in their craft and draw you into their story as if you were a person in their room, sitting on a chair watching
B0046B1KHG|5|Love this movie.  My kids enjoy watching it and so do I. It is funny no matter how many times you watch it.
B000B5OD4I|5|A great watch. I have a collection of five Seikos and this one is by far my favorite. Fits great, keeps accurate time for an automatic, and the build quality is top notch. You can wear this in the boardroom, the courtroom and on weekends without a problem (I've done all three). Don't hesitate to buy this one if you're looking. At this price it's hard to beat.
B00992CF6W|5|The reason you should get this app is because it it great for all ages. I am in 7 th grade and I know some a lot older kids loving this game. It worth every penny!
B00005NWRS|5|Wow! - This album is one hell of an album. I do not know why the editoral review is so critical of the songs on this album. [. . ..] This is music that is passionate and sincere. I can not stop listening to this album. It is incredible. I can not wait until I get a chance to see him live. If you like any of Ryan Adams previous material, this is a must have. Go get it, you will not be disappointed. Rock on--
B00475AYJQ|3|Great plot and characters, Fast paced, I loved reading it  BUT  I was very disappointed in the ending. The main character is just waiting to die without having addressed many plotlines left hanging and no sequel in sight...... I wish there were at least rumors of  another several books.
B009NY43NY|5|This book is not being given the credit it deserves. No Sookie doesn't end up with Bill or Eric. After admitting to herself that there are things she wants out of life that a vampire can't give her she goes t o Sam. If you remember she always had feelings for him but always told herself that it was inappropriate because he was her boss. It would have been stupid for her to continue on with a vampire. With them her life was always in danger with no positive outlook for a happy life. I thought it stayed true to Sookie's upbringing.

6305127646|5|Clearly, Val Kilmer is comfortably in his thesbian element when playing  a myriad of characters/saints. At some points, Kilmer in not easily seen, mixing into the tale, seemingly asking you to find him - as a viewer. If  one was to count the characters Kilmer plays in this film, the number would  reach over a dozen; this is of little significance as the romantic plot of  an underhanded free-agent falling for a beautiful, intellegent physicist is  played out.
1439170916|5|I'm a family physician, and I deal with cancer every day that I work.  I initially avoided reading this book for a variety of reasons.  Cancer is a distressing, depressing topic to deal with:  Why would I want to read a moderately lengthy book about something that I've had more than my fill of both professionally and personally (both my parents died of cancer, a year apart)?  I was wrong to avoid it, and when I did read it, found it to be deeply rewarding on two levels, a bit disappointing on a third.<br /><br />Level One:  Medical history.  The history of cancer, dating back to its identification in Egyptian papyruses, then tracing its course up to 2010, was entrancing.  Filled with fascinating anecdotes, descriptions of the lively cast of characters that tried to engage cancer over more than 3000 years of battle, and a clearly laid out scientific history that moves from theories about an overabundance of black bile to the intricate workings of suppressor genes and oncogenes, the book is simply a marvel of illumination.<br /><br />Level Two: A Cautionary Tale.  As the author chronicles the incredibly aggressive approaches that early surgeons and oncologists took toward treating cancers \\"liquid\\" (leukemias) or \\"solid\\" (lung, breast, etc.), one is rocked back on one's heels while contemplating the arrogance and brutality of early and more recent treatments.  How many of the hundreds of thousands of women that received radical mastectomies actually obtained a result superior to that which a simple lumpectomy would have afforded?  NONE, may well be the answer.  When lawsuits (and in some cases, laws) forced HMO's and other health insurance companies to pay for bone marrow transplants for breast cancer victims, the treatments killed more women than they saved, at the cost of many millions of dollars.  Mukherjee also brings to light case after case of medical pioneers that glimpsed truths about cancer, but then were subsequently mocked, persecuted, even run out of their professions for daring to have insight.  Mukherjee also gently, but clearly, points out the dangers of letting the American political process mandate the direction of research, often with tragic consequences.<br /><br />Level Three:  No author is perfectly effective at telling a tale.  Mukherjee is most effective as a historian and a science writer, less so when he tries to plumb the human aspects of an encounter with cancer.  The book begins and ends with descriptions of his relationships with patients with cancer.  These encounters seem a bit heavy on drama, and a bit light on the hard and somewhat mundane work one does while walking a patient through the course of their illness (be it a successful treatment or a failure).<br /><br />Summary?  This book is not just a good book. It is an important and rare book, both in its explanatory power regarding the disease of cancer, and in the lessons that such a thorough and unblinking history of medicine call forth.  It changed the way that I explain cancer to my patients, and it changed the way that I thought about my own profession as a physician.  Having read it, you will not be able to read the news (e.g. the recent recommendation that PSA not be used to routinely screen for cancer)through the same lenses that you used before.ring to have insight.

B00C8S9VKM|5|This is simply one of the best American history books I have read.  I know that the title says it all: One Summer in 1927, but I was still not prepared for the breadth of the American experience during this time period.  I was riveted even by detailed tales of the early air feats.  Every character comes to life, every instance gains national importance, the information is detailed in ways that sets each event into a greater prism of history,  This book is simply Bryson at his very best.  A great read from cover to cover.
B004GUSG4M|5|Riveting. I stayed up all night reading it and I never do that. Wow. This book grabs you. Is it really a first novel? Can't wait for the next one.

B00DPH7QFM|5|.... of the master. First off, I was very impressed with the technical quality of this DVD. The only quibble I would raise is the sound editing was a little off in places (guitar too loud, keyboards too soft, etc.). Very good overall, tho, and the video was excellent.<br /><br />From an artistic point of view, this performance strengthened my opinion that Blackmore is the greatest pure rock guitarist ever. Blues players like Gary Moore and SRV, soul-less speed fanatics like most of the young ones, pyrotechnics experts like Hendrix and Van Halen........... none of them measure up to Ritchie. Nor do any of them have his mastery of such a wide range of styles (even more obvious now, with the totally different stuff he is doing with Blackmore's Night - at 65 years of age!). And don't EVEN mention Clapton. He hasn't done anything worth listening to since Blind Faith and D&D.<br /><br />One sad thing, tho, is that this Rainbow line-up worked really well backing Ritchie up, and he appeared to be having fun, too. He even almost grinned a couple of times! Almost, but not quite........... ;-). I thought Doogie White was a wonderful choice as vocalist. Some people seem to think there is somebody out there who can mimic Gillan, Dio AND Coverdale, and that ain't gonna be. By this time, tho, October of 1995, Ritchie was pretty well burned out on R&R (he'd been doing it since the early 1960s), and was ready for something new - enter Candace. Personally, I welcome Blackmore's Night as a great new chapter in the Master's career, but this final version of Rainbow might have been really good if it had lasted a bit longer.

159448385X|4|At this date, there are 2711 reviews to choose from. I am keeping this very short. 'A Thousand Splendid Suns' is a worthy follow-up to the great 'Kite Runner'. However, there are two important shortcomings not mentioned in the 'Most Helpful' reviews.<br /><br />-I at least came away with very little understanding of the various tribes' and factions' relationships, both with each-other and the modern world. Various leaders and their actions are mentioned dozens of times in the book. Soviet influence and even Afghan Communists figure prominently. The mixed signals of American Democracy and Capitalism come up. But nowhere does Hosseini help us make any sense of it all. Granted this would be very difficult to do, but the religious, tribal, and imperial origins of the immense suffering of the Afghan people is central to the book.<br /><br />-Part Three, at 150 pages, has a bludgeoning and repetitive quality that mars the overall story. 21 chapters alternate between Laila and Mariam being tortured and tormented. And that awful Rasheed is 21 times awful...awful... ad-nauseam. I don't think there is anything soft or glossed over about 'A Thousand Splendid Suns', so it is difficult to understand how we are to respond any more to Laila and Mariam's suffering.
0393035158|5|_The End of Faith_ is an insightful, well written, and well reasoned exploration of what Sam Harris believes to be a failing of the current rules of civil discourse, namely the taboo of religious criticism.  Harris effectively argues that, with the technological advances of our era, the potential consequences of irrational terrorist violence are unacceptably serious.  He goes on to point out that, in the post 9/11 world, it is irresponsible not to acknowledge the fact that some of this violence can be directly linked to religious belief systems.  Working from this base, Harris makes the case for the need to \\"prosecute a war of ideas\\" in which the very idealogical root of organized terror can be combatted openly, and without shame. <br /> <br />Although Harris' treatment of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam is not gentle, neither is it malicious.  Harris does not accuse all persons of faith of being terrorists, but rather, points out that some people will tend to be more adamant in the application of specific articles of faith, and demands, therefore, that we subject these articles to rational scrutiny. <br /> <br />Finally, Harris does not deny the importance of spirituality to the human experience.  He merely makes the case that a rewarding spiritual existence need not require someone to believe things which are irrational, or which have no evidence. <br /> <br />-Matt

B00005RDRO|4|This is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. If you watch it over and over you will catch somthing new each time. The characterizations of fictional detectives from years ago is dead on, pardon the pun. There is not a weak member of the cast, each does their level best and such a cast of recognizable faces too. If you want a great movie that will continue to hold your attention viewing after viewing, get Murder by Death, you'll laugh till you.......die? Ha!
0375836675|5|Markus Zusak never disappoints me. I first read his The Book Thief and was completely mesmerized. I fell in love with his writing style, and so I searched and found I Am the Messenger at my local library. I was so obsessed with it that I read it all in a few hours and decided I had to buy it so that I can peruse it often. Markus is such an incredibly profound writing and his way with words will leave you wanting more. The story he tells within I Am the Messenger will haunt you in the best possible way.

B0017R5UAA|5|A friend of mine recommended the Foxes to me and since my first listen to this record months ago, I have been hooked, mesmerized and moved by their music.  What I most love about their sound is the mix of 60s folk along with a more spiritual Celtic sound.  I certainly haven't listened to enough music this year to say whether this is one of the best albums.  However, I've listened to just enough to say that this is my favorite album of the year.  From the first notes of \\"Sun Rises\\" and \\"White Winter Hymnal\\" to the last songs of \\"Meadowlarks\\", \\"Blue Ridge Mountains\\" and \\"Oliver James\\", this record moves my soul.  Along with their EP, the Fleet Foxes have me hooked.

In this case, yes it's about a lawyer and a law suit, but so much more at the same time!  This book will definitly make you think, make you fear and make you cry... you'll LOVE IT!!
1573223026|3|I have to say I liked High Fidelity and About a Boy much better than this novel. It felt a little bit as if Hornby were going through the motions. He does his usual stream-of-consciousness thing with the characters' internal monologues, but it comes across as each of the characters being much more analytical than they would otherwise seem. <br /> <br />The fracturing of the narrative across four viewpoints was also a problem. The book jacket touted them as \\"four distinct voices,\\" but at first, they really weren't. About halfway through the book, they became distinct. Before that, the changes felt jarring. <br /> <br />Also, I don't think he handled the topic as well as he could have. It came across as kind of glib with a manufactured sunny ending. I don't think it was a realistic depiction of how suicidal people feel, with the possible exception of Martin, who had loads of self-loathing but was not very likable. <br /> <br />That said, if you like Hornby, you should probably read this. Just check it out of the library, as I did, rather than buying it in hardcover. Or wait for the paperback.

B00A285OOW|5|This is her latest book in the series and her first person mode continues to enthrall the reader. Her prose is beautiful. It continues the series and advances the history line that clearly will lead to her next book. It will be even more enjoyable if one reads her earlier books in the series as the characters are intertwined in each of her books. If you have any knowledge of England's history you will enjoy all her  books even more. Her writing style beings you close to her characters. Almost like looking over their shoulders. I did not want to put this book down.
0440237688|4|this book was allright.  but i didn't understand like why did the world change frokm regular to utopia and what went a way first like color or feelings.  also what happend to Jonas and Gaberal.  did they die or did they.  the best person in the book was the old man beacuse he was the only one knew what was going on the world and no one else knew.  i woould reccomend this book to any one who lilke sci fiction.  it is a great book to read on your own.

6300216039|5|Romeo And Juliet - No Ordinary Love Story...<br />Franco Zeffirelli's Oscar winning 1968 masterpiece was filmed in Italy (Verona, I believe though I'm not 100% sure of that).  The film is rich in costume and scenery and the  performers are simply extraordinary.  Olivia Hussey (Death On The Nile; It;  Psycho IV: The Beginning; etc.,) shines as sweet Juliet, Leonard Whiting's  (Frankenstein: The True Story; The Legend Of Young Dick Turpin; Rachel's  Man; etc.,) portrayal of young Romeo is unparralled and of course Michael  York (Logan's Run; The Island Of Dr. Moreau; Austin Powers; etc.,) is  outstanding as fiesty Tybalt.  But the true shining star in this film is   the delightful, Ms. Pat Heywood (Who Slew Auntie Roo?; Root Into Europe;  etc.,) The Secret Garden; who steals the screen with each moment she graces  it.  She plays Juliet's Nurse and does so with such power, whimsy and  conviction that you simply must love her.  Pat Heywood gave the commonly  droll Nurse character life and vibrance I have yet to see in a performance  of this play live or filmed.  The scene where she goes to the church to  meet Romeo is absolutely side-splitting!<br />My sole complaint with this film  was that there was a bit of trimming done to the original script.  Some of  the dialogue was cut down, but only true, hard-core Shakespeare fans would  likely notice.  You've tried the rest?  Then watch the BEST!<br />Concerning  the ages of the stars:  I include this mainly as a side note, for it's been  my experience that there is always some confusion, question and  disagreement concerning the age of the young stars.  Here is their birth  information in hopes of settling any debates.  Hussey was born April 17th  1951 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Leonard Whiting was born June 30th 1950  in London, England, UK and Michael York was nearly ten years their senior  (May 27th, 1942 - in Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, England, UK).  <br />Not that  it's ever been a debate -- as far as I know it hasn't-- but I do not know  Ms. Heywood's birthday...Just for the record  :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I love the interaction and pecking order with the servants!  The home/castle is so beautiful.  The lifestyles of all are fascinating to watch.
B00Q7WBFTA|4|I enjoyed the film and would actually give it a 4 1/2 but that's not available.  Others have written about other things, so let me just focus on one thing.  Meryl Streep is of course our greatest actress or perhaps tied with someone I'm not remembering.  What stood out in this movie is that during the musical numbers, Meryl not only hits notes I've never heard her hit so well (and we know she can sing), but she also continues to act during the entire song.  If you know musicals, there's often some acting, but then the singing starts and it's just a musical performance.  But Meryl brings the full character into the songs, and we know what she is feeling and even some of her twisted takes on things.  This may actually be one of her best performances, but they don't give Oscars to people singing in musicals any more.  But she deserved the nomination.<br /><br />This performance alone elevates this movie to must-see.  Others like Anna Kendrick and Johnny Depp in his small role and on thorough the cast are all good, each brings something to the plate, and the singing has more Broadway-quality voices than, say, Les Miserables had.  Everyone is good.  But with Meryl, you get all that makes Meryl a cut above the rest.  I don't think anyone in the cast would be insulted by 2nd billing.  They have to know they're watching someone who is one-of-a-kind.

0805095152|5|If you're lucky, there are times in your life when you can say that a book changed you for the better. Reading this deeply moving and stimulating work by surgeon Atul Gawande (who doubles as a writer for The New Yorker magazine) is, for me, one of those times. I feel a little bit better equipped to deal with issues of illness and death, not least my own; I now know the right questions to ask in deciding how to balance treatment options with concerns for quality of life; and I am more aware than ever that each of us sees his or her life as a story and we all want a meaningful last chapter. This book deserves a wide audience, because its audience is all of us.
0440211727|5|&quot;A Time to Kill&quot; is the best Grisham book I have read. It engage you into the character. You will feel the sadness, the helplessness of the characters. This book is hundreds times better than the movie. &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; is a Must Read book
0156027321|4|I became interested in reading this book when I saw previews for the movie. I found the book to be very well written but it did not capture me as seems to have others (based on the volume of positive reviews). I think this one of those novels that grabs you on a spiritual (meaning of the spirit not in the religious sense) level or it does not. I was hoping for more.
B000XUBFE2|4|I just watched the movie after reading the book, and man, the director did not do it justice. The book is heartwarming and is told from a different perspective. I really enjoyed it.
B00LWC4VKK|1|Let's use an advanced hand-held computer to emulate extremely old technology.
0984334904|4|I really like this cards because they have included several examples on the usage of each Kanji, so it is ease to understand the different uses the can have.
B000J103OI|5|The Devil Wears Prada is a good movie. Wonderful movie based on the book. All stars did a great job.
B004BSFC46|4|These little things does the job as it states and does what I need it to do, buy me time with the kid.
B00DZJ82W6|5|Best presentation of a classic album, combined with all the recording session extras you could ask for.
B0042816YK|2|This picture was clearly lacking in spiritual depth, making it a waste of top line talent.
B002Q9VPFM|5|Where do I begin...This ultimate cut brings everything together. The interwoven of the movie and tales of the dark freighter. It's so amazing! I loved it! Now...if you think this was good...wait till you see \\"SUCKER-PUNCH\\" This movie will blow you away! I will say no more. The director of this movie brings this movie to life so well and exactly the way the comic was done. What more can I say...if your a fan of the \\"Watchmen\\",the comics and the director. This movie is for you! Here's what you get: 5 disc's...Disc 1: The Ultimate Cut. Disc 2: Special Features: 5 featurettes and 11 video journals. Disc 3: Your Digital Copy. Then you have the \\"Watchmen\\" the complete motion comics...12 episodes.On 2 disc's...that's 4 & 5. Now...you need to get tales of the dark freighter by itself. There are few things that you don't see in the Ultimate cut...watch it and see for yourself. By itself...it's truly amazing! I say no more! And with that I say...\\"THE END IS NIGH\\"
B008Y1YK9Y|3|I found MIB3 to be just OK. Josh Brolin was great and he had Tommy Lee Jones voice and mannerisms down pat. The storyline wasn't that great, though. Some people may find it difficult to follow if they don't pay attention to every detail. I had higher hopes for this movie and was disappointed.
B006MW3V6U|5|My sister bugged me forever to watch this show, I am so glad she did.  I LOVE this show, and watching on my Kindle is a great way to catch up
B00ESNDQWY|5|Love it!
B0054JZC6E|4|well,  I think that this is a really good app. I must admit though,  it's hard!:) the only problem is that u have to unlock games. but I think that's better than having to buy it with ur own cash.
B00T3DNKIE|5|Wonderful book. I didn't know what to expect from a sequel to a classic, but Ms. Lee delivered. This may be another American classic in the making.
B0044XV3QY|5|The cover is the most spectacular I have in my collection.   I highly recommend this bluray, a must for any collector
B005HEFB6M|5|love it!
B00BWBHIUG|5|very fun and entertaining! the challenges keep you coming back. also you are free to customize and make the reef your own.
B003XYERRM|5|A painstaking drawn picture of royal medieval England from bedchamber to battleground. I was left with the haunting sensation that perhaps the good a man does can live long after him...especially in the hands of a dedicated historian. Loved everything about this read...A+<br /><br />Definately will make the avid reader appreciate her trilogy, Here Be Dragons, Falls The Shadow, and the Reckoning...
B00K3N5RWK|4|I would recommend this game to anyone with a love for fantasy games. It is worthwhile turn based strategy game
B007FG9LIE|3|This short read was interesting but nothing new or great. I would suggest for a reading assignment for any child between 10 and 14. Didn't make me think too much outside of the box but certainly inspirational for a young writer.
B00KR6332Y|5|Love this Christmas CD.  There is nothing like the Pentatonix harmony.  I plan on purchasing more of this group's CDs!
0142004413|5|I read this book when I was a teenage and I am ordering this to keep. It's a very entertaining and full of humor. I highly recommend this book.
0670451495|5|Before wrapping the book Make Way for Ducklings I read the book out loud as if reading to a child and found it absolutely delightful.
0307405095|5|Excellent!
B004FGA2LC|5|Great movie.
B0000042H4|5|This recording of the RING brings this incredible work to life through a realistic and true reading of the score mixed with a  tremendous amount of musicianship. <br />The solists are stunning, and the choral work in  Gotterdammerung is superb. Solti works so well with this orchestra, and  this is my favorite recording of this incredible and vast work. I have  listened many, many times. One never tires through repeated listenings.  What an orchestra! What a conductor! What a soloists! A brilliant and  stunning recording!
B000IDEQTK|4|Good movie but difficult to watch because of the interruptions. Think it took me two days to complete watching the movie.
B008K8H9C6|1|Today's free app of the day for Apr 16 2015, Amazing Alex Premium, is a Physics-Based game for rolling a soccer ball into a basket.  This is a repeat free app of the day from Jun 18, 2014, the 11th for this month, the 49th for this year, and the second in a row. April is repeat month due to cost-cutting.

B000NVT0RU|5|Wonderful video of Moroccans experiences with bigotry and racism
B0013UIUBC|5|I have seen this movie about 3-4 times and have enjoyed it each and every time.  I just wanted to have it in my collection so I can watch it anytime I want.
B0048LPRD2|5|An achievement in filmmaking. An unsettling, uncomfortable achievement, but an achievement nonetheless. Do not go into this with expectations of any kind. This film does not care about making you feel good.
0375869026|5|A touching story of bullying overcome by love by a fabulous young man and his caring family.  A must read for middle schoolers.
B00A8ECU24|2|This is supposed to be an app aimed at children, but to complete goals you are forced to spend money & add friends. I wouldn't mind if there was a way to add people who already play the game, but it wants your Facebook info? My kid is 6, she has no Facebook page or email address.  Also one of the main characters cost over a hundred dollars to purchase??!!!! Crazy!!!
B0067Q42BY|1|Cannot play it.  Click on tiles, does nothing.  Worthless!!!<br />I am deleting it from my Kindle unless corrections are made.
B00KA7JIII|5|BEST GAME EVER...not like anything I have ever played...please do more levels...beautifully done...makes you think....but wonderfully relaxing...LUV it...
B00900NAFI|5|Fanatic works great and it was free,

B00B2V66VS|5|Stupid monkey LOVE THE APP hate the monkey it's HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!! and it has this wheel that has spikes on it. and at the begging there's a rope wild thing:)
B000H5TH1Q|5|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />Though not a true horror film in the literal sense, this film does have genuine moments of horror & dread. Beautifully photographed, cleverly edited, an amusing script with a wild story line. Brilliant movie score! My favorite movie of director Brian De Palma! His most Kubrick & Lynch like film, & of course, Alfred Hitchcock. A quasi, \\"Rearview Mirror.\\"<br /><br />A twisted tale of murder & deception, with the moral of the story, don't always believe what you see, & if you see it, don't keep watching, do something about it. A story of a man battling his inner most fears. A story of a man whose voyeuristic tendencies get in the way of his actions, as he becomes obsessed with his beautiful neighbor down the hill, watching her through a telescope. Watching her until...<br /><br />A masterful mystery thriller, that will appeal to not only fans of those genres, but many horror fans to.
B006MW3UZW|5|This series is wonderfully written, has great acting, and beautiful cinematography. Several people talked me into watching and I was hooked at the pilot. Seeing the interactions among the aristocracy as the reality of the precariousness of their position becomes apparent and they have to ll with harsh reality shows their humanity. The stories among the servants brings them to life. It's complex and completely engaging. I can't speak to how realistic it is, not being around during that time, but it seems the producers have made efforts to make it as realistic as possible. Downton Abbey is a real gem.
B00HBQWGXK|5|Lee Child does it again with another very enjoyable Jack Reacher novel.  This time Reacher has to travel to Paris and London in search of an elite sniper team destined to attack the heads of state at a G-8 summit.  However, things do not turn out as planned - do they ever when Reacher is involved?<br /><br />While a bit predictable, Child has a way to clearly express all of Reacher's thoughts and how he continues to out-think everyone.  Okay, Tom Cruise is not Jack Reacher, but I am still hoping for another movie to come out soon.  Maybe Cruise can continue to enlist every short actor on earth to make himself look taller in the movie.
B00GH4R95C|5|Very good acting.  Excellent story (although not quite traditional).  Loved the fact that this movie provided more up front information on Krypton.
B00BLCHZC2|5|I really liked it. I think the one thing that I shouldn't have done was to look up the characters from the show to learn more about them. Got a lot of spoilers from those sites. But as long as you don't do that, I think the large amount of foreshadowing won't bother you, as it did me.
B00H1RMWYW|5|good show
B005GY0Y8S|3|It took a lot of getting into and I was going to give up on it but persevered.<br />There were some anomalies but also some good descriptive writing.  I didn't<br />understand the main female character's reaction to the discovery of the truth.
B003Y5T0X6|5|The story is straightforward and predictable, but the characters are endearing and believable. Some of the nighttime scenes really convey the power and menace of these phenomena.
B0001ZMWQO|2|This album, quite simply, is crap.  It's boring and, at best, mediocre.  I tried and tried to get into this, not wanting to miss out on what was hailed as such a great disc.  But I just don't get it.
B00IJJUIMY|1|I own this item. I am very unhappy with the pricing structure. Kindle edition (Digital) is priced higher then the hardback book.
B00DFFHUUA|5|How can you not like G. I. Joe? I think this was as good as the first movie! Would highly recommended it for a family night movie.
B004IE9REE|4|Entertaining but hardly comprehensive or informative. I read it in 1 hour. It was fun to rea up on fragrances you love and those you hate. For the Perfume nerd only.
0140157352|4|This is another great book about how to communicate effectively in challenging situations. As the title suggests, it focuses particularly on negotiations, but the ideas are broadly applicable. The authors discuss the advantages of principled negotiation - negotiation that is based on merits - over positional bargaining. Good negotiation, they state, should produce a wise agreement, be efficient, and should improve or at least not damage the relationship between the parties. In essence, they are talking about a win-win rather than a win-lose situation. The four key points of principled negotiation are: 1) separate the people from the problem, 2) focus on interests, not positions, 3) brainstorm options, and 4) develop objective criteria for evaluating proposals. Much of the book is devoted to outlining these four key points in detail followed by a section on some difficult negotiation situations, such as how to negotiate when the other party has more power or they refuse to negotiate. The book concludes with a section of frequently asked questions about the method. This book is a great complement to Difficult Conversations.
B00HDMMISA|5|Ms Moriarty did an excellent job getting inside the mind of a victim of abuse to help the reader understand why it is so difficult to leave an abusive relationship.

1250061539|4|Your level of cynicism will probably determine whether you find Carmine Gallo's hook for his latest book on public speaking to be a shameless exploitation of the TED brand or a brilliant marketing move, but whichever side you come down on, there's no denying that he's penned an extremely effective primer on the art of the presentation.<br /><br />A great deal of what makes this book so useful is that he ties in so closely with TED, which means that when he's using a particular Talk to illustrate a technique it's an easy matter to cue the video up and see first hand exactly what he means. Gallo also seems to be as fan of Keep It Simple, Stupid, and sticks to nine very basic but fantastically important methods to improve speaking. Some of them, in fact, seem so simple as to be overly obvious (like the importance of familiarizing yourself with your material enough that you can deliver it with a level of comfort that allows you to engage with your audience), but he's quick to point out that even professionals who depend on their ability to pitch to make a living can make rookie mistakes if they're not fully aware of themselves and their audience.<br /><br />Gallo also cunningly applies his presentation tricks and tips to his own book, which means Talk Like TED is conversational, well-researched, and broken into easily-digestible segments. It makes for both an entertaining and illuminating read, and his association of his principles with the visual examples of the TED Talks makes it invaluable for any budding speaker.
B0044C5SCU|5|All five years of the series are tightly woven science fiction tale.  Also a great love story between father, wife, and son. Great, relatable character.<br /><br />CKerns
B000B0WODA|5|I love Franz Ferdinand and I first hear about them by reading an article in NME magazine (thank you british press)! Even though some of the bands they praise are not all that great (like treating the members of Oasis like they are gods hahaha!)Well on impulse I brought the debut while I was visiting a family member in California in March 2004 and saw them in concert that September. After my first listen I immediately fell in love w/ the song \\"Walk Away\\" and I also love \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\" b/c it is so autobiographical I know that Alex is talking about his ex-lover Eleanor Friedberger of The Fiery Furnaces. The lead single \\"Do You Want To\\" is amazing and  \\"This Boy\\" was played at the concert I attended even though I think there was some rewriting done to the song. I would suggest this album to new and old fans of Franz Ferdinand but the new fans should be warned that there isn't a cloned copy of the bouncy \\"Take Me Out\\" single so if you only are interested or hooked on Franz Ferdinand for or b/c of that song then give the album a couple of more listens before writing a quick review on first impressions.
B000002H70|5|&quot;Fascination Street,&quot; &quot;Pictures of You,&quot; &quot;Plainsong,&quot; &quot;Untitled,&quot; and &quot;Lullaby.&quot; These songs are just classic Cure material. This is one band that is able to make  good music without being repetitively annoying. True, almost all of their  songs sound alike, but they are distinguishably the Cure (whoever heard a  Depeche Mode song and thought it was the Cure?). Robert Smith and crew pull  off a great album of intelligent songs with the regular trippy goth style  and bluesy rhythms. Get this album.
B00FPH3YQA|2|This was not very well thought out, buy a good way to end the saga of the Hangover.  Maybe is 20 years they can do the next generation that'll go straight to video.  Like the American Pies and Revenge of the Nerds
B001BANK32|5|One of his classics. Incredibly enjoyable read at a great price. Thanks Kindle =)
0761172726|5|I am very happy I found this calendar.  That's the style I am used to which in Italy, where I come from, it's the norm.  I do not like calendars that have several days on the same horizontal line.  I like calendars that have from the 1st to the 31st in a vertical line therefore I will keep ordering it every year.
B00TYB95I4|5|Outstanding movie.  Intense.  It's easy to see why J.K. Simmons won the Oscar!
B00E8KLWB4|5|Long-running game. Cumulative challenges keep you hooked.
B0055SWM08|5|I actually bought Quell Reflect first, but I loved it so much I had to go and get the original Quell.
B0044XRIMW|5|Outstanding!<br /><br />What's there to say; everything was marvelous. Music, direction, etc.  Also historical.  Now I'm just making up things to say to have enough words.
B000000H3Z|5|BENEATH THE REMAINS is a metal classic that every fan of metal music should own. It is full of fast riffs, raw power and energy that is missing from todays music. There isnt one single weak spot on the album that I can find. All the tracks are awesome, but I think that the listeners need to really listen to BENEATH THE REAMAINS, SLAVES OF PAIN, LOBOTOMY, MASS HYPNOSIS, and INNER SELF. This is music from a time when SEPULTURA was starting to find their niche and start to become known outside of Brazil. This albums puts them up there with all the other metal heavyweights of the time METALLICA MEGADETH SLAYER ANTHRAX. If you are lucky enough to find the version with these bonus tracks buy it while u can. A HORA E A VEZ DO is an awesome song that rocks. If I could give this album more than 5 stars I would
B000BEZPQE|5|My favourite band is the SlipKnoT! <br /> Their new live album is great!! <br /> My fav. songs are:The Blister Exists,Left Behind,Wait & Bleed! <br />
B0059WTMLW|4|This is a good game. If you like sudoku or a mind thinking game then this is it. Lots of fun. Like to do this on long car or plane rides.
B0017HRCQU|3|While i've to admit, Batman Begins is hands-down the best Bat-movie ever (that was, until The Dark Knight surpassed it in every angle), the sad part was that i've received my Limited Edition Batman Begins Blu-ray edition that wasn't in mint condition.    The package looks a bit bloated, like it was exposed to water or something. This couldn't have happened because of the courier guys since the actual box itself wasn't bloated nor was there any trace of wetness to it. Luckily, the content wasn't damaged. But still, it loses its aesthetics and/or collector's value to it. Couldn't be bothered sending this back to Amazon for a replacement since i've to chug out some extra cash for it (mind you it's not cheap to send over to America from Malaysia).    I am no stranger to ordering DVDs and Blu-rays from Amazon (it's been 2 years already). Since this is the first time this has happened to me, it's fine. Just hope this wouldn't happen again. Amazon, beef up okay?
B000F3UAFC|5|great movie
0345803485|3|I really wanted to read and like this book. It just couldn't be done. It felt like a story I've read before. I wasn't a fan of the writing, either. To me, it seemed like it had a lot of potential, but didn't add up. I think I might try the second book to see if the series gets any better. I'm just on the fence about this one.
B00NEQRNVG|1|the series started out interesting but is dragging on with the same conflicts.  it should have ended by now.  i won't be continuing this series.
B00CO5AQ12|5|They loved it
B001CW7ZXA|5|watch it over and over and never get tired of it !
B009FZHYKU|3|It just got stupid. And the new town thing is ridiculous.  Go back to zombie hunting and and stay consistent with the disease thing.  By all accounts from season 1 the old Farmer man would have been dead instantly after having his leg gnawed on
B00KFEWCTI|5|The best album of her career. Don't sleep on Mimi
B000P407K4|5|This is just the dumbest, silliest movie ever made. For those of us who lived through the constant ordeal with the USSR--it was hard for us, at first, to even believe our eyes and ears when this bombshell came out. We were used to hiding under chairs to protect ourselves from the impact and explosion of H-bombs. Talk about ridiculous. Put your hands behind your neck, and stand in a doorway if you don't have a basement. And that will stop the H-bomb from hurting you.<br /><br />I was a kid in school who lived 50 or so miles from the biggest atomic weapons assembly plant on Earth, and when the school gave the three bell signal for an atomic weapons drill, me and my friends would just look at each other, and laugh out loud. We knew the &#34;commies&#34; would hit our nuclear facility as fast as possible, and if you thought the shades on the concrete in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bad, an H-bomb would make that look like a dance in the park.<br /><br />Anyway, you don't have to be a geezer to love this movie. Every single part was played to perfection by every actor. It's weird when that happens at all, and especially weird with all the big name people in this film. If you haven't seen Dr. Strangelove, you'll want to watch it again pretty soon, since you'll lose a lot of watching time the first time from laughing. And another watch will help you hear what the lunatics in the movie are actually saying, layering one pile of gibberish on top of another. If you know this film, then, well...you know.
B00CKYIENY|4|Someone should make  a movie of it.<br /><br />Or at least a TV miniseries.<br /><br />I'll bet this Jane Austen was foxy.
B00HDMMISA|5|Set in Australia, this story of an unhappy unwed Mother who is trying to find a comfortable place for her and her son takes some very unexpected turns. A small town with an established social order is not the easiest place to try to fit in for this young woman.  Beneath the surface of civility is a society with many problems.  The surprise is how close she actually is to the community without knowing it.
B0013D8LOU|4|When I saw this film I had actually no idea it was a musical, so I was quite surprised to hear the opening song. Normally I'm not really a musical fan, and I also believe, that this movie could have been done better as a standard, straight (pardon the expression) Tim Burton feature film. Don't get me wrong, it is still a very good film. But not as good as it could be.    The acting is, as you'd expect with this cast, top class, and the direction is beautiful and accomplished. The music, which obviously plays a big part in this film is also very good and the singing is surprisingly not ear shattering (they are actors, not singers after all).     However, the, by far, best thing is the dark, gloomy, sad, corrupt, bleak, forlorn feel that director Tim Burton drapes over this motion picture. It is a thing that only a handful of directors master, and probably none as well as Burton. The imagery, the colours, the looks of the actors. It all combines to create this wonderful murky atmosphere of desolence and despair. Magnificent.    I subtract a star for the singing bits because I honestly think it would've been better as a normal feature film, but it is still highly recommendable and definitely worth watching.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Great read
B0040I09RM|5|Bad ass awesome
B001NLKXK2|5|This book is written from the perspective of the one dealing with this terrible disease, rather than the story being told about her.  Each case is different, but I found this book very insightful.  I hope it will be a help to those who know someone with this disease, giving wisdom and understanding to know how to relate to them.

1416594787|3|I suspect at least 95% of the people reading this book already are in the \\"evolutionist\\" camp. The other 5% are either on the fence, or looking for ammunition to refute evolution and support ID. (Or as I like to think, perhaps it should be called UID -- Un-Intelligent Design).    I basically fall into the evolutionist camp, but the more I read, the more questions I have. Not really unusual, I find it's common to have more questions the more you learn about something. The questions just get more specific.    In this case the main thing that stuck in my mind after reading the book is the CONSISTENCY of mammalian skeletons -- they're are ALL THE SAME in number and order of bones, while the size and function of each bone varies among different mammals. The same thing is true for crustaceans -- the relative location of various body parts are all the same, while the size & function changes significantly.    I fully \\"get\\" that this can be seen as proof of evolution. However, the thing that bothers me is that the evolution in these examples seem to \\"BEGIN\\" with a basic defined structure that DOES NOT VARY. It seems like there ought to be fossil remains that show the evolution (at least an occasional mammal fossil with fewer bones, for instance) to this basic structure that's in place today. I don't recall the book offering that. Of course maybe they exist, but palaeontologists might \\"fill in the blanks\\" as they EXPECT them to be, as opposed to what they really uncover.     I need to go back to another book I read \\"Shattering the Myths of Darwinism\\" by Richard Milton. I seem to recall he had something to say about this sort of thing.
B00KY7PEAA|5|I freaking love this game you need to get it
0316017922|4|Perhaps some of the most intense criticisms of Gladwell's work come about because his ideas are not always supported with rigorous scientific methodology. His books are good \\"airplane books\\", i.e., books you can read on the plane and during layovers. You can usually finish them in a day.  Really this is all he is trying to do; he is satisfying the curious reader with thought provoking journalism. Though his style might be considered persuasive, it is up to the reader to apply this knowledge to his or her life and determine whether it is relevant or true.    \\"Outliers\\" does this quite well. One idea that Gladwell reinforces is that focused time and effort is likely the only difference between some of the most influential humans and some of the least influential. At a young age Bill Gates had access to a computer terminal through his school and he took full advantage of that access. Because of this unique opportunity, Bill Gates may have had more hours logged in front of a computer than any other person in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Gladwell goes on to explain the rule of 10,000 hours. If you spend 10,000 hours doing something, you are likely to have a significant degree of expertise in that subject. An academic course of study, or the time it might take to obtain a senior position in a job might be 5 years or so, which is about 10,000 hours assuming 40 hours per week of work. it is an interesting idea and one to think about the next time you ask yourself \\"is this really worth my time?\\".    One study that Gladwell mentions follows the family tree of immigrants in the US during the Industrial Revolution.  In some of those cases, he showed how an immigrant who worked in a textile factory would spawn children who eventually became owners of tailoring or seamstress businesses. However, their children then became doctors and lawyers, many of which were extremely successful. He illustrates how timing, a particular gap in activity, and other conditions led to the greatsuccess of some of these lawyers and how their family history made it all possible. In three generations, these families saw a total transformation of lifestyle. One thing he did not address (and I still haven't answered for myself) is why the 3rd generation was not also entrepreneurial in their vocation? I suppose to be a successful lawyer one must have an entrepreneurial spirit, but I am curious to see what vocations the 4th and 5th generations choose.    I'd suggest \\"Outliers\\" to anyone who has asked what makes a person of history a person of history. If nothing else, it will give you something to think about on the 12:55 from Newark to Houston.
0345807294|1|Very very simplified version of an old and tired tale, big company controls all the worlds info. Sadly, the book falls very short on delivering any new ideas around this topic and drags you along for what feels like ages only to leave you exactly where you started. Would not recommend.

1451695195|1|This was one of three books ordered and the top in box.  The cover and first page were caught in the box flap/packaging tape and torn about an inch and a half.
B004LWF9R2|5|Great for looking at things from an outside perspective
B00E9PMML2|4|Excellent price for three movie set (both Blue Ray and DVD). Received it in good time. This finished my entire set (for now?),
B004HX4RT6|3|Nothing special but more than adequate. Fills the empty moments on occasion along with a bunch of others that I rate the same.
B00AEJM6H2|5|I love this game and it is so addicting to!! my 8 year old Granddaughter loves this game also!! had to fight for my kindle when she is here.
0345525558|5|I read a lot of books and I forget many of them. Some books are just so good they stay with you and you enjoy the memory of them for years. This is one of those books and I am so glad to have read it. Beautiful and well written
B001BC5HXG|5|East of Eden is a modern retelling of Cain and Abel. It's Steinbeck's magnum opus and in my opinion his best work.
6304106017|5|This is by far the best movie i've ever seen.  The whole scenario is portrayed so well that you get caught up in it quite easily.  The lines are great, and the characters are unforgetable.  The camera angles were equally  as great as the cast of characters.  Overall this was a great movie!
B00E00OGE2|5|Purchased as a gift for my granddaughter.  She is very pleased  with this.  A good gift for a child Would recommend to other parents.
B009UX2YAC|5|Some game I love to pay it when I just got it.<br /> Not the same as temple run but just as fun. Coins are hard to get but that's ok<br />When you get a prize. Box. I RECOMMEND THIS APP
0452295548|5|The book was in excellent condition and arrived sooner than expected.<br /><br />This book gave wonderful insight into the &#34;workings&#34; of the brain and how we can all benefit from the author's experience with her own stroke.
B008IJT0CE|5|Great choice of sounds to help you off to dreamland.  There are options that are supposed to help with deeper sleep and dreams.  But to use those, you have to have it playing in both ears.  I guess if you can just play it through the speakers - that would be better.  I don't sleep alone, so I need to use my earbuds.
B009TGODOK|3|Meh.  Predictable, but nevertheless mildly entertaining.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Awesome best game ever but stressing
B00RLK35ZE|5|Mesmerizing! Beautiful!
B0002W18MU|3|\\"American V: A Hundred Highways\\" is similar to its four predecessors in that it has Rick Ruben's typical handling of Cash in a bare bones, folksy setting. Usually, it's just Johnny and his guitar. This release is a break from its forerunners when it comes to quality control. The contemporary covers just aren't as compelling or recognizable as Johnny doing Beck's 'Rowboat' or Geoff Mack's 'I've Been Everywhere.' The traditional material is also softer as 'God's Gonna Cut You Down' just can't compare to Solitary Man's 'Wayfaring Stranger.' The original material is also less substantial as a tune like 'I Came To Believe' doesn't measure up to 'Country Boy' as played on \\"Unchained.\\" It's no coincidence that this disc was posthumously released; it's unlikely that Johnny Cash would have approved. While there's a quality control issue, there's also no bad music here. Johnny's voice sounds good, especially considering his physical condition. 'Love's Been Good to Me' is the highlight among otherwise decent songs. The issue here is that the songs don't meet the high standard that the previous American recordings set. These songs would have been a welcome addition to \\"Unearthed\\" or a similar release of music worth hearing but not strong enough to wear a Roman numeral. Unable to give Johnny anything less than five stars, the zealots will vote this review down but the listener should appreciate shades of gray. \\"American V: A Hundred Highways\\" is worth having, but make it the final disc in your American collection.
B004DLPXAO|5|THANK YOU
B00C5R7B0I|3|For so many years the highlight of the year was the new Cornwell book.  But as the years passed her characters have become mired into repetitive psychological mumbo jumbo about what each is or is not thinking.  I find myself wishing that the four main characters would all be put in the same room with a therapist and thrash out their problems with each other, then move on to what Ms. Cornwell started with- solving intriguing, complex murder mysteries.
B00364K6YW|5|I think I have watched this about 50 times and will watch it hundreds more.  I just love the portrayal of the characters.  My favorite movie version of the wonderful book.
0316776963|4|Always, always a fantastic choice.  Everything by David Sedaris is amazing, and I want everyone to jump on his bandwagon.
B00009V7P8|3|I'll say some positive things first: Rice has an emotive, soulful voice, can pen a good lyric or two, and is a talented musician. That said, these same things work against him, at least for me. His voice, while distinct, becomes grating at times -- the way he'll say a line softly at first and then sing it at a higher pitch rather dramatically. It's a nice touch that gets a bit overplayed, especially in The Blower's Daughter. Lyrically, I feel the album has a propensity to teeter off into the land of \\"tales for heartbroken teenagers.\\"  But I think that's what it means to do so that's OK. Heavy-handed and dramatic lyrics like \\"Stones taught me to fly/Love taught me to lie/Life taught me to die\\" seem to target teens flopping on the sands of a crush or heartache but, in the end, they lack real punch.  <br /> <br />Musically, there are many things I like, as much as things I don't. I dig the disjointed piano on \\"Cheers Darlin'\\" and how it builds and breaks into singing strings at the end of the song. I also was impressed with the more agressive jams on \\"I Remember\\" and the extra songs on \\"Eskimo\\". At the same time, the strings / acoustic guitar combination don't do much for me on songs like \\"Older Chests\\" and \\"Cold Water\\" excpet maybe make me sleepy. <br /> <br />I've heard plenty of talk about how Rice is the new voice of modern folk music, how he's a saving grace in the music industry, etc. These are lofty claims that not many can live up to -- and I'd like to see where Mr. Rice's songs are being played in 5 years. Most likely on a soft-rock station over the speakers at a dentist's office. \\"The Blower's Daughter\\", in the end, might be the tune I'm listening to as I get my first root canal.
B0060ZJ7BC|4|I'm not much of a baseball person, but I really enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />Brad Pitt has quite an interesting persona onscreen and couple that with Jonah Hill made for quite a show.<br /><br />I prefer non-fiction, so that was an added bonus with the history of this one, and something I hadn't heard about before this movie.<br /><br />Definitely entertaining, but not mind blowing.
B00BAXFECK|3|Was not a pleasant experience reading this book, however I did continue to the end and was happy to finally finish .
B0047WJ12K|4|I considered this is one of the best performance of Dicaprio. Besides, the movie makes you think and be attentive all the time so you do not get lost. I liked the plot, however, I wished the end was a little bit more longer. It ended, in my opinion, abruptly.
B00JH49OTS|1|Not worth watching. Slow moving and disappointing.
B005K17RU0|5|I love my accelerated. When weather channel changed so did I. It's so easy to get around. No problems.all you weather channel fans give it a try!!!!
B00A8OXGXQ|5|The movie is a classic and I never get tired of watching.
B00687PWQG|4|Very good 4th of July viewing binge.
6304873441|5|GREAT QUALITY!  MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED THIS MOVIE.  SHE WATCHED IT 3 TIMES IN A ROW THE FIRST DAY SHE GOT IT!!
B00FAPF5U0|5|I'm so hooked!!!
B007J4T2G8|5|Loved the intensity and connection between the characters. Will definitely be finishing the series in record time for me. Can't wait to start the next book.
0143038583|5|This book is amazing.  It takes you on a culinary journey. The detailed process of how your food gets to your table and what it is made out of is shocking, horrifying and enlightening. Since reading this book I have changed the way I eat entirely. I was always fairly healthy but I am much more conscious of where I get my food from and I have enjoyed this change--from eating take out to preparing my own food from the farmers market and local grocery store. It's very well written, detailed, interesting and life changing. What more is there to say.
B001GF8WPI|5|I'm not usually a fan of Will Ferrell but this movie is excellent. This is Not his usual sort of role.  Queen Latifah also plays a very nontraditional role.  Very well made and the casting was perfect.  Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman are superb of course. Great movie!
0930289234|5|The product is good good great good good good good good good great great great good good and a great and good book.
B0001HAHXW|4|First thing, Clapton, like B B King, has too often mass marketed a much ballyhooed reputation for essentially Vegas like endeavours, all Siefried and Roy and no Tiger. That is categorically not the case here. Perhaps it is the loss of his friend, George Harrison (who always seemed to bring out the best in Eric, even posthumously in THE CONCERT FOR GEORGE), perhaps it is the subtle and sublime triumph of the CD &amp; DVD ONE MORE RIDER, but whatever, Clapton has turned in one of the most elegantly understated and sophisticated homages to his mentor that could be conceived and executed by anyone. This disc is a triumph on every level. This CD ranks up there with his first solo effort, the R&amp;B rave ERIC CLAPTON, which chronicled the highlights of his association with Delaney and Bonnie, and laid the groundwork for DEREK and his ill-fated dominoes.<BR>The support work of Preston, Low, East and Gadd is as on as they have ever been. No doubt, having worked so beautifully on the Harrison tribute, that same commitment and energy oozes through every track. Preston, in particular, is absolutely perfect in evoking Booker T. Throw in Muddy Waters accomplice Jerry Portnoy on harp, and the whole eneterprise is one of the most satisfying blues projects in recent memory.<BR>So, for the die hard nostaligically challenged Domino fans, face it Allman and Radle and Whitlock are dead (I like Andy Low more anyway), Gordon is bouncing off the rubber walls. Winwood has made no sign that he wants to reconvene BF, and Mayall and Clapton have long ago outgrown each other. Clapton never thought he was God, and in this project, he does not presume to be as mighty as Johnson. Instead, he has delivered as honest and soulful an interpretation as to what Johnson meant to him and his craft as you'll ever hear from anybody. Is there the sound of the Devil in Eric's playing? No. He grew out of that as well, and he had the good fortune of having the remarakable George Harrison as spiritual brotherall these years. You ain't gonna hear no hell hound. What you are going to hear is an absolute master at the peak of his powers delivering one of the best CDs of his career. <BR>Beautifully done, Eric. Sheer Genius.
B00000DGUY|5|Wonderful !
B005MLOKXA|5|complexity of plot and characters--superb.
B004ZMWUCU|5|I cried multiple times- out of both joy and remorse. It truly changed my perspective of the world. The writing was undoubtedly phenomenal in every way, highlighting the ever so touching storyline.
B000068FWC|5|awesome seller and product. shipped quickly! thank you!
B000B8QEYC|1|After a five-year interval, Enya disappoints with her weakest album to date. I have been a devoted admirer of the Irish singer since \\"Orinoco Flow\\" first hit the airwaves years ago, and have eagerly awaited each and every offering, including her singles, which oftentimes contain extra bonus tracks that turn out to be mini-masterpieces. I understand how many critics brush her aside claiming that her music is too artificial, too cold, too computer generated to stir genuine emotions, and with those criticisms I strongly disagree, until now. True, you buy an Enya album because it sounds like an Enya album. No matter how many years go by in between, songs are frequently interchangeable from one CD to the next, and that's okay. Enya's strength lies in the perfect blending of her unique voice and her music, and the magic that she creates with them in the studio-intricate spider's webs of fragile melodies and haunting refrains. <br />  But the magic is absent from \\"Amarantine\\". <br />  The entirety of the album's brief 45 minute running time is, to put it simply, exceedingly dull. Instead of spirited, otherworldly, evocative songs, this album flows by lugubriously, and depressingly. The songs are pallid and barely stick in the brain. Only the title track-a word whose definition along with being a vibrant shade of red, means to be everlastingly youthful or beautiful-has sparks of that once Enya allure. Even the lone instrumental piece, \\"Drifting\\" is ponderous and pales in the light of other such previous wordless tracks as \\"A Day Without Rain\\", \\"Tea House Moon\\", or \\"Watermark\\". <br />  Enya's \\"sound\\" is also different. True, there's nothing wrong with expanding or growing as an artist, but as the old saying goes: \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\\". Some decision seems to have been made to push Enya's vocals to the forefront, instead of having them interwoven with the music itself as displayed magnificently on her past recordings. For Enya, this album is almost acoustic, theexquisite flair missing, her voice too front and center, making some of the tracks, especially \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\" and \\"A Moment Lost\\" seem like songs that wafted in through her castle window from someone else's country album. On the whole, \\"Amarantine\\" feels cobbled together, as if from bits and pieces left over from other recording sessions and rightfully discarded. <br />  Too sad... <br />  Again, I am a devoted Enya fan, but this album was certainly not worth the wait. Hopefully, we will not have to wait another five years to hear the true Enya sound reemerged. <br />   <br />
B000FC0ZAI|4|I bought this one by accident, thinking it was the Cloud Atlas the movie was based on.  It is not that book.  However, it is a fascinating read about a subject not many people know about: the war effort in Alaska during WWII.
B000000992|5|to tell you the truth i say tis hard to pikc their \\"best\\" album but i disagree with it being lateralus. i dont dispute what you said about the climax of their musical creativity or whatnot...but Opiate to me stands out as their best. its one of the best debut albums i have ever heard, for a couple or reasons. first, its f'ing hard. for a band right out of the gates it has POWER depth and a definite message. lateralus (altough great because it was made by Tool) isnt my fav album. i do see what your saying though. best tool song? possibily 46 and 2
B0064MPXFA|5|I never watched this on the network, but I have thoroughly enjoyed<br />it for binge viewing when I have time. The characters are smart,<br />yet flawed, and the stories are believable. I appreciate that<br />the language is clean and the sex scenes are given to the imagination.
B00I7696IG|5|Marvelous prose, witty and superb account of thre British  Oxbridge social and political environment
B00BLCHZC2|5|love it
B009FB3XTA|5|Yes, I am a huge Twilight fan and I love this movie. This dvd came in a timely manner with no damage. The movie is wonderful. Thanks
0345350472|5|This is one of the best fiction novels I have ever read. The book is much better than the Blade Runner movie, because the characters are much more human (even the androids) and they seem to have much more senses of purpose in the book. Definitely recommended.
B0089EHWQE|5|I am a sucker for happy endings. So I was worried that this book was going to let me down. It may have not had the ending I had wished for. But the book would not have been the same with a different ending. It was exactly how it was meant to be. Definitely read this book. It will not disappoint you.
B00FAPF5U0|1|I do not understand how to play.
B008Y6XUTU|5|Love Nancy Meyer films. Watch it over and over again.
B000FC2L1Y|5|Reading all for second time. Still is great the second time around!!!!!
1885167776|5|I have so loved the wisdom and simplicity in this book.  It gives us a starting point for all of our decision by asking &#34;THE QUESTION&#34;.  I now preface every thing I am ready to commit to with &#34;THE QUESTION&#34;, and then I know if I am using my valuable time well.  This has made an impact on my life, and I am sure it will impact yours as well.<br /><br />ps<br />&#34;THE QUESTION&#34; is...What's the ONE THING I can do such that by doing it everything will be easier or unnecessary?
630587493X|4|A very interesting  plot that really makes you think.  The story starts with Andrew, a house android, who was constantly being upgraded, until he became pretty much a human, except for his brain, which would keep him immortal.   The story makes you think, &quot;What is a true human being?&quot;
1449410243|2|I bought two copies and wish I had borrowed it from the library instead.  The book is bound nicely and the quality is very good.  The content is not very funny and not much new.  I was going to give a copy as a gift but will probably give it to goodwill along with my copy.
B007B6VOG0|5|Every song is better than the last.  I listen on the treadmill every morning and keep the songs in my head all day.  Great musical talent!
B00BUCW54Q|5|Excellent movie. It was action-packed with a plot twist. I liked it. I would recommended everyone to watch it and buy it.
B00FFEM0W2|5|I am updating my complete set of &#34;Star Trek: Enterprise&#34; to Blu-ray and previously purchased &#34;Season 1, and Season 2&#34; this copy of &#34;Season3&#34; looks great in Blu-ray,and I have pre-ordered &#34;SEason $' so my collection will be complete in a couple of months.  If you are a fan of &#34;Enterprise&#34; I would suggest, no--recommend you upgrade to the Blu-ray editions. I am really satisfied, and T'Pol has never looked more beautiful.
B0089LOG02|4|Weaving the stories of the two women together was a wonderful way to tell their stories in a parallel manner and to link the past and the present.  The only reason I didn't rate this novel a &#34;5&#34; is that I simply could not reconcile Vivian's actions with her daughter with everything else I knew about her as a caring human being.  (Spoiler alert!)  After what she went through with her time at the orphanage and with her first two &#34;adoptive&#34; families, I just can't see that she would give her own child up for adoption.
B00DUGCLY4|4|This is a pretty cool game, it's a fun way to pass the time. Some of the puzzles were pretty challenging
B00004Y6OA|5|Awesome!!
B001BR7CZW|5|I can remember when I saw this movie on TV with my dad when I was about 8 or 9 years old. Now being 27, and remembering how much I enjoyed all the action even at such a young age, I decided to pick this up on instant video. I have absolutely no regrets.<br /><br />Upon watching this for the first time in almost 20 years, it was all coming back to me. The chaotic car chases, destruction of the mall, Nazis jumping off the bridge... who could ask for more? Equally hilarious was how Jake and Elwood remained relatively un-phased by all the destruction and mayhem they were causing, as if it never even happened - PRICELESS! Also not to mention is that the music that went along with all the action fit perfectly and did a superb job of enhancing the experience for the viewer.<br /><br />Speaking of music, the fact that this movie featured the appearances of legendary musicians such as James Brown, John Lee Hooker, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, plus many others I may have missed, was definitely a bonus, especially for an avid music lover like myself.<br /><br />Seriously, this movie is one of the best that has ever been made in the history of filmmaking. Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi (R.I.P.)are true legends, and will always be renowned for everything they've done.
B007FEFLTO|4|It is not as fast paced as his last book and his characters are less believable.  He is good about bringing in the story from the last book, just in case you had forgotten - which I had at times.  It is also interesting to see how he weaves in history  as we know it today.  It is a good read.
B006LSZECO|4|Gillian Flynn is an excellent writer and it is worth the read!
B00DBSZEH2|5|Excellent movie with a lot of action. Pilot is different and exciting.
B00003CXCD|5|Excellent story, excellent actors.  Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck are fabulous.  A young Eddie Albert also appears (Green Acres star).  If you enjoy classic films w/ excellent actors, this is for you.
1594203334|4|I'm only half way through the book, so I couldn't rightfully give it the full 5 stars, but I must say that so far I am absolutely smitten by the experiences that Pamela Druckerman writes about. I find myself nodding in agreement with much of what she has to say about her observations in French parenting and taking mental notes to add to my parenting style. Eye opening and comforting all at once. A must read for every mom-to-be.
B00LXLM05I|5|Great game. Like Diablo. The music on the first level is terrible but the game greatly improves after that. You're always able to craft or sell items so no limitations there.  Well worth an add. Here's a pointer-save your gems and get one party member then use them only to expand your ability slots.  Once you've got those maxed then add additional party members.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Not just any match game as some levels are a little challenging, which makes it that much more fun!! Must have game for sure.
B00AESN8XY|4|Well if you ever wanted to just kill everyone..This is for you.. try to crate the perfect disease to kill mankind..
B00U7VDC7A|3|I just started playing but it seems to be a fun game this far. I wished it moved a little faster.
B00AGH5LF6|5|My 4 year old son just started watching Home Alone 2 this past weekend getting ready for the Holiday season. This has become a nightly request in our house. I love hearing him laugh throughout the whole movie.
B00OTD72PA|1|Didn't like it.had to pay first, deleted it
B007ZRZF8I|1|this game would not even download it sucks and they need to lower the prize to free. Please please do it
B007J4T2G8|5|Reading some of the reveiws, I thought that this book was going to suck, big time. Some reveiwers said that this book was juvenile, but I do not understand why. This book is amazing. I loved the plot and all of the characters! Especially the main male lead, Christian. He is tormented by a terrible past and it makes you feel sympathetic toward him. He is extremely hott and possessive. Controlling, easily jealous, and possessive. That may sound like an abusive person, but not at all. Super sweet and caring toward his love, Anastasia. The biggest problem that I had with this book is that Ana had Christian apologzing continuously for things that tormented him! It annoyed me greatly. E L James should have made Ana not so weak. You should most definitely read this book. I could not put it down and I am now reading the third book, which is just as good as the first two.
B00992CF6W|4|this games ok.But the updates take FOREVER!And its also one of those apps that you really enjoy at first but then you lose interest it it.Such as Flappy Bird&trade;
B00CEMH31Q|5|I think this is my favorite. The boys have hit their stride with these very catchy yet meaningful songs.  very worth you money.
B00JVZ0DQG|5|This game is fun and addictive. I keep coming back throughout the day to farm. And the support staff is extremely helpful and respond quickly on those occasions when I make in-app purchases and what I've bought isn't credited. The support staff always remedies the problem. Thank you! Love this game.
B007JU5HSO|4|This release contains several CDs I already own but has THE ORIGINAL version of EPSILON IN MALAYSIAN PALE, which I've not been able to find on CD (the recent re-recorded version of E.I.M.P. of a few years back is not very good in my opinion) This set also has many alternative versions of tracks from the albums I do have. (AQUA, AGES, STUNTMAN, PINNACLES) The one glaring omission is not including MACULA TRANSFER, an album I have on the original vinyl but like E.I.M.P. can find nowhere on CD... that omission is the only thing that keeps this from being a truly excellent compilation of the great Edgar Froese's solo work outside of Tangerine Dream... but what is here is great stuff. Four CDs for an affordable price. Not a bad deal at all.
B00000K2SC|5|I think that this is one of the greatest movies of all time and I really think you should get it if you havent already!  When you watch this movie, you get a totally different idea from the begining to the end of what it is  about!  It is interesting and when you watch it you just won't want to  stop!  The action doesn't stop and it never gets boring!  You've got to  get it!
0061122416|5|Excellent tale of man's quest for meaning - but not really heavy.
0061950726|4|This was a very good read. The author did a fine job of creating characters you cared about. I did like the juxtaposition of the earlier tale versus Molly's modern day struggles. Well written. I was fascinated by the historical occurrence of the Orphan train. I had never heard of this before.
B005GFPZYK|1|Saw movie - left with unsatisfied feeling - perhaps his death was too soon to add 15 minutes to say WHAT WAS CAUSE OF DEATH!!! So I immediately ordered book on my Kindle thinking that would satisfy my mind - but NO book did not give CAUSE OF DEATH EITHER.  WHY NOT????  The movie was a fluff piece by Client Eastwood and once again a BIG LIE to the American public with short memories.  It opened with falling of the towers on 9/11 - the hero wanted to SAVE HIS COUNTRY.  Does any one remember 15 of the hijackers on 9/11 were from SAUDI ARABIA NOT IRAQ.  I was associated with oil industry since 1960 - lived in Houston when the Bush family and King of Saudi were BFF's.  Only reason our troops were sent to Iraq was so Cheney and a CEO of a major oil company could get their greedy hands on the 3rd largest oil supply in the world.  Not for revenge of 9/11.  We are now in a no win war forever based on a LIE by George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
B00GGNIU6G|4|Just love his music....
B007ZXK08C|5|I found this story compelling, and riveting with an excellent pace and many twists and turns.  A great read! I can't wait to see how it's shared as a movie.
B00MU9R5OI|5|It's a good game to play should be a little harder.
B004KBSQBA|5|Paul Simon's Graceland cd is wonderful. I had it on a cassette years ago, and I am happy to have it on cd.  Play it all the time.
B0054JZC6E|5|it rocked the world!!!!  I loved it.  I would recommend it to anyone who is bored. It was awesome.  EPIC!!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|4|Ice Age Village at first May seem like a normal village game that will be boring in the first ten minutes BUT NO! It has a storyline and mini games! In Ice Age Village you have to build a village to help poor critters that have lost their homes. You can build fun buildings and design it anyway you want. So get the game! I highly recommend it.
B00VWQ3LQG|2|Tedious and predictable, all style and no substance. Every single aspect of this movie is derivative and dull.
B005PW3OS8|5|I have watch this movie several times love it each time. I glad I have the DVD! It is one of the best super hero movies of all times.
1439102813|5|This book is awesome and riveting.  I think it would be a must read for anyone who has loved ones with Alzheimers and to know a little of what they are going through.  The author did a fantastic job of making this a real life story.
0920668372|5|My favorite neighbor got me a copy of this book for Christmas w/ a beautiful personalized message from one mommy to another.  I just purchased this book for a friend of mine who is also having a little baby boy.  It is a beautiful story & totally brings tears to my eyes everytime!
B00UP0TWWC|3|Strictly out of respect for a long and very successful career.
B0031YJFCQ|5|Loved all three of the books in this trilogy. They capitvated my attention made it hard to put down. Did not want it to end!
B008MG1E4A|5|Prompt delivery of this fine product.
1892005034|5|If you have ever had issues with interpersonal relationships (and who hasn't?), this gives you a whole new way to look at the self/other dynamic, and gives you a way to deal with people in a way that will make you a happier person overall.  Even if you don't think you need help with interpersonal skills, Rosenberg draws some fundamental truths into his work that can enrich anyone's view of themselves and the rest of the world.
B00KF7VWBO|4|Addictive. Binge watching worthy. Too bad the second season just couldn't measure up.
0805028846|4|I am a museum educator and ordered this book to help me plan a class on paper engineering.  I have found the directions well written and the illustrations clear and simple to follow.  The projects are appropriate for a range of abilities and there are a number of beautiful examples of ways to take the simpler techniques further.  Some require a steady hand on an exacto knife and others merely need scissors, but I have been very impressed with the book thus far.
0618526412|5|The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is a novel that will stay with you forever. Carson McCullers (only 23 when she wrote this!) writes profoundly with usage of every human sense. I agree that it is a masterpiece. <br />The story takes place in Georgia during the Depression. There is thick racial tension but music is solace and passion is ablaze. The world is a delicate place but the characters are cetainly not caucious within it. The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is a perfect representation of the spiritual isolation that is the shadow of mankind. McCuller's 'gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated...' and 'gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty.' Everyone becomes someone through this story. It is beautiful, timeless, influential. One grows stronger by reading it and it can be enjoyed by people from all walks of life. A modern day comparison might be Geraldi's 'Lucky Monkeys In The Sky' because the isolation and search for beauty are very dominant in both novels.

B002CGSYNU|1|Do not know what camera this company is looking at but this lens does not fix, about 1/2 the size of the lens I am thought I ordered. Sold the lens I bought at my yardsale because shipping it back cost more than its worth!
B0073XORLU|5|I love this cd.  It is  quite different from the original Thick as a Brick album.  I know that Ian Anderson writes a lot about London.  The last song on the album is an address.  I got my map book out and looked it up.  This album has song great songs on it that are comical, serious and great to listen to.  Highly recommended.
B000Q6ZG5C|5|good
B0014XCMVM|5|One of the best CD's of the year!  Listen to \\"Not as We,\\" \\"Incomplete,\\" or \\"Versions of Violence\\" and you will agree.    Also, check out the Bsides - \\"Madness\\" is one of the best songs that Alanis and Guy made!
B0040GUE38|3|It's an okay movies, but could have taken place anywhere. It's not quite the Sci-Fi you think.
B009V5KI98|5|If you like the oldies this is a great family musical to watch!!
B0086700CM|1|well designed and fun. I am just not a gamer, however I can see where people would become addicted, if they had that gamer-gene
B00003CXBK|5|although not the best anime I have seen it was great watching this on the big screen... and this high quality dvd is the perfect adition to any collection!
B00UENHBAU|4|Great game
B00GH2SOM6|4|Although not written by Clancy himself but it's almost as good. Much better than the previous 3 Jack Ryan books.
6304711921|5|It's no secret that the majority of Europeans see American cultural import as something highly entertaining but not very complex and sophisticated. The plots are simplistic, the characters lacking individuality,etc. I am not talking here about the well-known masterpieces but the everyday  Hollywood produce make this opinion well-deserved. On the other hand  today's European cinema is often anemic and uninspired. Of course I  generalize but for the most part it's true.<br />Living in Moscow I try to get  the best of both worlds and in The Nightmare Before Christmas I found  something that can be called flawless. It's very entertaining, the music is  the classic of the genre, the visuals are just unbelievable! It's complex,  it's fun, it's perfect in form and content. Frankly, you can hardly expect  all that from the American animation industry lately represented by  Anastasia, The Hercules and other sodomizations of the world history. So  the Nightmare's team did a great job of creating this surprisingly original  piece of art.<br />The main idea are the perspectives of communication between  the worlds that are so much different.  What happens if one of them come  uninvited to visit the other with the best intentions and gifts designed to  please. The result is far from idyllic.<br />What happens if the extraordinary  person is tired of his world and thinks that the real life is elsewhere. So  he travels abroad and finally finds the happiness at home.<br />It's strange  that some of the reviewers consider the Haloween creatures too violent.  They are no more violent that Maurice Sendac's Wild Things or the monsters  our children like to invent when they exchage the self-made horror  stories.<br />The portrayal of children of the Halloween Town is very accurate  - the little ones are unexhaustable, inventive and ready to do anything  just to see what comes out of it- just like my 7-year old son.<br />So this  DVD is an ideal investment and do not regret.
B005IQZB14|4|A very good story about a woman trying to find her way.<br />Two stories here - one about Cheryl finding a way to cope with loss, trying to figure out where she wants<br />to go and why, and ultimately who she is and what makes her tick.<br />The second story: her actual hike along the PCT told with detail.  What it took and how she made it<br />through to her final destination.  My feet ached for her!  Those darned boots.. I could picture myself<br />along with her - and I know I would have made some different decisions along the way, all which would<br />have ended my hike long before it should have been over.  Cheryl is my  hero.<br />An honest and insightful story.
B008Y2FRFO|5|this game is awesome! I cant really explain it! anyway buy this game!!!!!! it will change your life!!!! buy it!!!!
B007SGM084|5|Wow!!! Amazing trilogy! Left me wanting to read more! Very surprised I enjoyed it! Nothing less than fantastic! Read it!
B00D7Z4GQY|4|Excellent - entertaining reading and easy to follow the characters, even if somewhat predictable.
B008Y6MKSW|5|Still funny after all these years.  Plus, it tells a nice story.
B00NFU3ZYU|2|The 3D on this movie is not very good at all. It's seems to be just a conversion and no one wanted to keep it in 3D. After a few minutes my guests were all suggesting we just watch it in 2D. Pretty disappointed.
B00ADQCBEY|4|I think I learnt a lot of things about parts of Los Angeles by watching The Shield, a real developing country in spots. The police readiness to bend the rules was also a surprise.
B000AP04FG|5|Mr & Mrs. Smith is one of the summers most entertaining movies. I have to say this movie was far better than i expected it to be. What makes this movie so awesome is the attatchment you get to the characters. Brad Pitt is awesome in this movie and hilareous as well. Angelina Jolie did a wonderful job as well. The chemistry between these two is intense and at times very believable. The movie does start out slow and is over the top at times, but it is really a great movie. I have always liked Brad Pitts (Fight Club, Troy) movies but with this movie you see more of a three dimentional character and not just some one dimentional hot looking guy on screen. If you like entertaining and awesome movies then check out Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The DVD will be released Tuesday, November 29th, 2005 and will be loaded with extras!
B00JPCCJFS|2|It's ok-ish. I think Follet should've stopped on the second one.  At a times I felt I was watching a soup opera, lots of cliches
B000002U8G|5|I used to say that \\"Wish You Were Here\\" was the best Pink Floyd album.. but then I get \\"Meddle.\\"<BR><BR>Meddle is definitely the best pre-Dark Side Floyd album, and it might even be their best album ever. It's so hypnotic, and beautiful, and the music they were hinting at with their previous efforts (Saucerful, Atom Heart Mother, etc) all came together perfectly on Meddle. <BR><BR>One of These Days is an excellent opener, and a very exciting one to boot. If Pink Floyd knew how to do something, it was to open an album. Nick Mason's growling, with Waters' menacing bass go together perfectly. and of course there's David Gilmour, who I absolutely idolize.<BR><BR>A Pillow of Winds is a truly beautiful song. made me weep the first time I heard it.<BR><BR>Fearless is a pretty damn good rocker! It's where songs like \\"Money,\\" and \\"Have A Cigar\\" came from.<BR><BR>San Tropez is the only song on the album Roger Waters, sang on, which is a good thing. It shows that Floyd was once a democracy before Waters became a creative dictator around the time of \\"Animals,\\" and \\"The Wall,\\" the latter being one of the most overrated albums of all time. It's very jazz influenced, like lounge jazz meets Sun Ra.<BR><BR>Seamus is HILARIOUS!!! It's a 12-bar blues riff about someone's dog, and even has Seamus The Dog howling in the background!! Filler to some, but it's good to actually laugh at a Pink Floyd song. The band did have a sense of humour!<BR><BR>Then there's the 23:32 minute closer... \\"ECHOES.\\" And it actually keeps you interested the whole way through. Something most of the 2 or 3 minute songs off the Wall could not do. It's very weird and trippy, but very reminiscent of an emotional nightmare. What a way to end an album off, let me tell you!  <BR><BR>If you're a fan of Pink Floyd, you MUST get this. Cough up a few bucks, and get yourself to a CD store, or buy it off of Amazon.com =). You will not regret it.

B00CHIMG6Y|3|Tsunami comes to town and everything is turned upside down. What follows the disaster is disaster after disaster under the guise of community devastation, social upheaval, massive displacement of people, governmental bureaucracy, overwhelmed medical facilities, food, water, and transportation shortages. What's more it really happened.
B00PSLQYWE|5|A great story with wonderful characters and beautiful setting.  We enjoyed watching every episode.

B000FS9FCG|5|The year is 2020 and the people of Great  Britain are blind. It's not entirely their fault--the government in the persona of High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has put blinders on the British as much as they are too frightened to see what is happening for themselves.     Britons' everyday world is very much like George Orwell's \\"1984\\".  The heavily censored media controls what they see.  Language has morphed to the point where harmless words now carry a serious threat. The Party is all-powerful and can make people disappear without questions.  The countryside is mined with cameras and microphones to detect any protest and the police and military are empowered to eliminate enemies of the state. The Government may well be responsible for the deaths of over a 100,000 of its citizens due to St. Mary's virus.     Then one dark November 5th night, Evey Hammond (Portman), a young British woman is walking home and is accosted by men bent on doing her harm.  She's rescued by a black clad figure in a Guy Fawkes mask.      He calls himself \\"V.\\"     V (Hugo Weaving) offers truth and hope to the British people.  Taking his cue from the Guy Fawkes of history who tried to overthrow the British Government almost 4 centuries prior, V promises that in a year's time, there will be a revolution--the Parliament building will be destroyed and the old government will be overthrown.       The film covers the next year's time.  First, the police are attempting to locate V through various means.  Evey parts from V and goes out on her own only to be captured.  And V continues to spread the word to the British people.    Every book writer aspires to at least one good line per page.  I cannot say how many that translates to in movies, but \\"V\\" is beautifully and thoughtfully written.  In addition, the acting on the part of the major characters is good as well.  How Weaving can translate so much character without a facial expression, eludes me.  Natalie Portman's performance as Evey in captivity is also stellar.    As I started off, I really regret not having seen this film in full screen.  I understand it's available in IMAX format and I'd love to catch it on that kind of venue.  In particular, the scenes from High Chancellor Sutler would probably be hair raising.      Though I have rented this film, it's now on my wish list to add to my collection.  There is enough content to make \\"V\\" worth watching again--and showing to my friends.
B007C2X4SE|5|The book arrived quickly and is just as described. I would purchase from this dealer again and have no regrets about recomending this dealer to others.
B00E00GWBM|1|This is s great album. However, I did not receive it. I recieved ACDC Back in Black and am truly appalled as to how that happened.
B0061P2L5U|4|A great strength of this book is its carefully assembled facts and comprehensive research.  It contains a full inventory of stories and a very thorough annotated bibliography.  It is hard to come away from this compelling barrage of facts without being convinced of the author's primary premise - that our elimination of early life pathogens and parasites has deprived our immune system of essential training, absent which, it turns on our own bodies creating a growing epidemic of allergies and autoimmune disease.<br /><br />It fails on the task of integration - what lessons should we take from each of these essentially self complete examples/stories.  After about the half way point I wanted to scream &#34;OK, I got it, lets move on&#34;.  The conclusion offers little clarity or relief, perhaps not wanting to take the risk of practicing medicine without a Licence? However, an opinion from such an informed researcher would have been interesting.  On timing: is it parental epigenomics/immunology; fetal transfer; early life; later life; exposure that matters most?  On agents: is it worms (helminths), virus, bacteria; is it special individuals within one of these groups?  Of course, the true answer is that no one really knows yet, but some more muscular integrative hypotheses would be a big help.<br /><br />In spite of all that, this is a field largely dominated by quack and fad medicine, and this book stays well away from all that nonsense.  Net, an important and useful study of the field of the super-organism, ie humans and our parasites.
B000068PQ0|1|I'm sure my music review will get slammed by many readers but i think the truth needs to be told.  The Flaming Lips is evidence why music has been sucking for the last five years or so...\\"In the good old days\\" there was competition among Beck, Pavement, Fugazi, Sonic Youth, Nirvana just to name a few cool bands...in short musicians with an original idea and inspiration!!!  Now, the music has gone totally pussy, twee, and uncreative with the Flaming Lips leading way.  The Flaming Lips are the most gimmicky indie band on the planet.  Most of their riffs and sound alterations are for no purpose except to sound \\"sort of cool\\" to people who don't have an ear for cool music.  There's no inspiration behind these songs...honestly, the Flaming Lips appeals to people who haven't got over their children's music phase.  For christ sakes,  even \\"Raffi\\" is more sincere than these prostitutes of the music industry.  The music scene will be a whole lot better off when these losers die.  While everthing of they do sounds really bad, the ultimate worst was their cover of Kylie Minogue's \\"Can't Get You Outta My Head.\\"  They transformed a sexy song into a bonfire sing along for a Christian youth group.

B005TBWN0K|5|It allows you to search any website of your choice and then take a pic when your done. It saves those pics in the app and in your own pics. I LOVE THIS. It's like snap shot, but I prefer this one.
B008ENNXQI|1|This movie had very little of the story's original plot. The most obvious change was  making Snow White the \\"Hero\\" of the story and making the prince a weak man who needed a woman to save him instead of the other way around. Sure, young girls should be encouraged to have confidence, but this movie is clearly trying to teach them that they don't need a man for anything. Maybe some would call me old fashioned, but I prefer a story where the hero is a man!
B00GRVV29E|4|The bigger the screen, the more fun this app is.  Only thing I don't like is having to keep my fingers on the screen.  I would love to be able to get it started then lift my fingers out of the way to look at it.  Maybe have either a button or screen tap to &#34;destroy&#34; the image.
B006MW3V6U|5|I was told about this serious by some very dear friends who started watching last year. So I started watching season 1 on Amazon and happy to be hooked on this extremely well done saga!
B006LSZECO|5|Gillian Flynn tells a compelling story of a relationship gone awry as two very self-centered characters over time peel away the images of who they thought they needed to be to impress the other.<br />Without giving anything away, let it be said that Flynn is always many steps ahead of the reader, and this, as well as her at once hilarious (because there is some truth there) and dark turns-of-phrase...and excellent grammar....kept me reading (at the breakfast table, as a passenger in the car, etc).<br />Perhaps there will be a sequel??
078322737X|5|During the 1970s there was a tremendous interest in '50s nostalgia, and American Graffiti hit the target dead-on.  It has been stated many times, but this film's soundtrack is without a doubt the finest collection of '50s/early '60s songs.  Those who were immersed in the '70s muscle car scene simply salivated at the romantic portrayal of cruising and street racing.  While this film is most often remembered today as a springboard for several future super-stars, it is much more than that.  The key story element centers around high school friends going their separate ways, leaving the lifestyle they love behind.  Anyone with fond memories of high school will be touched by the confusion and doubts that each character experiences when facing an uncertain future.  This is a truly great film by any measure...highly recommended.
0738206679|5|The author explores the wide variety of social and biological activities that make up the world we live in.  Including among these, of course, is the ever ubiquitous World Wide Web.  The thread of the book, is his contention that there is a common theory of 'networks' that applies to all of these seemingly disparate fields.<br />  The author draws upon a wide variety of studies and research, including, but not limited to, his own.  It is fascinating to read discussions of how Hollywood actors are connected to each other, followed by a discussion of cellular biology, and realize that there is a rich commonality between them in how they connect and behave.  The author carefully and methodically takes us through example after example as he explores network theory, and its recent expansion due to new discoveries in the field.<br />  The books is very readable for those with limited experience in math and science.  For those that wish to go in more depth, there is a large body of footnotes and references.<br />  Highly recommended for anyone remotely interested in science and the connectedness of the world.  Maybe John Muir was right: everything *is* connected to everything else!
B00PXZT1RA|5|This game is like clue but more interesting
B0015KGWZG|5|Wonderful book. Many helpful thoughts and ideas to find ones happiness. I have truly enjoyed all of Dr. Dyer's books. Reading this book will change your life.
1401923127|2|\\"Biology of Belief\\" lives up to the  promise of interesting biology but not the promise that it would have anything meaningful to add to the question of belief.  At least author Bruce Lipton has the good grace to confine his \\"belief\\" nonsense to an epilogue rather than elevate it to the level of the scientifically interesting material by including it as an actual chapter.  I would have realized the title was misleading if had paid attention to the subtitle \\"Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter and Miracles.\\"  What was I thinking???
B0034G4P80|4|When I received this item there was a large cut all the way through the cover which I was not happy about but luckily the movie played fine so it wasn't that big of a deal.

B0001ADB8C|5|Please note this set just covers George's Dark Horse Years - hence the title, and thus this set does not include his releases before (ex. All Things Must Past and Dark Horse).    But, the albums that have been included in this set have not been available for awhile - they were out of print for a long time.    Nicely remastered, great photos and reproductions of the covers.  The only thing I missed in this set was the song \\"Cheer Down\\", but I believe that that track wasn't on any of the albums here anyways other than the \\"Best of Dark Horse album\\" which is out of print.    Great set!  Oh, and the DVD is pretty nice too!
B00B4804MQ|5|Loved the movie!
B006FE83UE|5|I saw this film 50 years ago, and remember it like it was last week.  My granddaughter read the book and fell in love with the characters.  I felt it was time that she saw the life breathed into them by this stellar cast.  It should be required reading and viewing by every school-aged child in America.  It is our all-too recent past...
B00003XACV|5|This is the first score I've heard by Thomas Newman, and the music fits the film perfectly. I remember leaving the theater mesmerized by the music and wanting to enjoy the music again, independent of the film. I was  disappointed when the first CD I saw related to the film was mostly the  popular music used in various scenes, so when the score was released I was  overjoyed.<br />The music is a bit minimalist and the style doesn't change  much from piece to piece. Each title fits perfectly with its portion of the  film -- you'll recall immediately which piece of music played during which  part of the movie. Never overpowering, this score makes for a great listen  by itself and perfectly compliments its source film.
B00946WM6Q|5|From the awesome intro scene to the ending, where revenge is sweet, this is without doubt, this Bond is one of the best of the entire series.
B003G4W49C|5|Definitely a different book from my usual fare. I picked it up mostly to get the story before the movie comes out. I was immediately drawn into the dramatic plot surrounding Ender and his military education. I loved the psychology behind it and both the flaws and benefits behind structured learning versus improvisation.
B004KNM3HQ|5|I've always loved Suede. During the nineties while my friends were all into grunge I was into Britpop, being a younger admiring sister to a brother who was heavily in to the Smiths ,the Stone Roses and Bowie I had no other choice. I loved the glam, the sexually ambiguous undertones and the dark complicated lyrics and music of that genre who, for me, accumulated in one glorious band - Suede. I bought Suede's first album when I was sixteen, from the first few notes and the iconic semi-jebrish lines by flamboyant, cocky, extremely talented and ridiculously sexy lead Brett Anderson I was hooked. Suede's self titled first album hasn't left my stereo ( the 90's IPod) for almost a year. By the time the band's second album was realest I was eagerly waiting to hear what musical masterpiece the duo Anderson-Butler will concoct. Dog Man Star hit me like a speeding train. This album resembled nothing I've heard before. It somehow managed to be both hauntingly beautiful and incredibly sad. I guess the emotional turmoil happening backstage made it what it is. It definitely didn't have the rocky explosive feel of their first album but it had something better - more mature maybe. Anderson's heart wrenching lyrics alongside Butler's brilliant melodies are the common thread between the songs and they leave you in tears. This album is a masterpiece from beginning to end, no song is better than the other (with the exception of \\"asphalt world\\" which should have an adjective invented to describe how good it is) if you want to buy only one suede album (although I cannot understand why) this will be it.  why should you spare the extra money for the deluxe addition? Well, Suede were always very grateful for their fans and treated us with immense respect, they still do so. I always conceder the \\"remastered\\" thing to be a rip-off scam led by music companies to make more money. Such is not the case with the remastered DMS (or any other of suede's albums featured in this format). The package isabundant with goodies making it money well spent. The Album itself features 5 demo tracks, The B-sides C.D is jam-packed with great songs, three of which I conceder to be B&Bs' greatest work; \\"My dark Star\\", \\"the living dead\\" and \\"killing of a flash boy\\". It also has three tracks which did not appear in any official album (yes - I mean sci-fi lullabies) the mediocre \\"stay together\\" ,\\"this world needs a father\\" and \\"we believe in Show Biz\\", it also features Brett singing in French. The DVD is filled with live shows and an interview with Brett Anderson and Bernard Butler years after the debacle that made Bernard leave, it's a treat. For us diehard fans who are eagerly waiting for Suede's reunion and a new album (which, I heard is in the making) this box set is a must as it fills our appetite for some new Suede stuff. For all the rest, simply put, this is a musical gem. It captures a time a place and a state of mind in pop-culture history and it truly is one of the best albums I have ever heard.

B00HV8TN7K|4|Good Movie
6301607929|5|picnic is one of my favorite films, ive watched this several times, and i think the array of characters from this little kansas town is wonderful, its underlying theme i suppose is repression and people trying to break free from the roles that society holds them in, madge the pretty one, millie too intelligent and talented for smalltown kansas, Hal who has just gotta be something in this world, strange when i first watched this film i didnt like it, but it seems like many films or music albums ive come to love took me more then one listen or view to get into them, perhaps some artistic creations need a little extra time too make their impact, thats why i try not too quickly dismiss films such as this that i dont like upon first viewing, anyways i recommend this wonderful old film, be sure to see the widescreen version on this, the idea of Picnic panned and scanned is too much for me.thank you..
B00OLMZIZK|5|Good!!!
B000000H48|5|i dont remember liking a sequal this much ever. to me this is a much betr written and played album than them. this beast from beginning to end just floors me to this day after being out for almost 20 years. the whole cd is a highlight so unless you listen to the whole thing you just wont get how great this is. and teh 2 bonus tracks on the remaster cremation which you can loop for a halloween party or at the grave alt mix its just a great cd.
B008Y720JU|5|Fantastic movie.
B000000WGL|5|A phenomenal solo effort from Keith, but it is in dire need of a proper remaster to do it justice. The sound quality on this CD (which has been out for almost 25 years) sounds thin, because the technology was not available at the time to create the full, rich sound that is now standard.<br /><br />If anyone is reading this who knows someone who knows someone who can get someone to get the job done, please, pass this message along: a REMASTERED version of this disc is URGENTLY NEEDED!!!
B004XUMMFE|5|Love this show. Wish it were made for more than one season. Great characters and great dialogue.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|So happy with this book and so glad i have it to read again some day!  I would recomend this book to anyone who loves a good read!
B000053GTK|5|The version of this I have is a re-issue of a re-issue - the original album (1973), GLORIOUSLY remixed, packaged in a miniature reproduction of the original lp sleeve, with two bonus live tracks from 1974 &amp; 1976.  The second of the live tracks, `In a glass house', is a pretty muddy, echo-y recording - but why quibble?  This album is one of the best of the era from a prog band.<br />Gentle Giant were a band of extremely creative, talented multi-instrumentalists - no one played only one instrument, and seeing them juggle parts in concert was a real treat.  Critics have accused them over the years of being `cold' and `emotionless' - nothing could be further from the truth.  It's easy to hear how much fun they're having with this complex music - and if you ever had the opportunity to see them perform live, it was easy to see as well.  None of the musically ambidextrous goings-on were performed just for the sake of showing off - their music is well thought-out, played with abandon and perfection at the same time, accompanied by intelligent and thoughtful lyrics.  Every single member of the band has a huge part to contribute - nothing is left to chance, and it's as fun for the listener to hear it all come together as it must have been for the band to perform it.<br />I've played versions of this album for people over the years who have never heard of the band - they've never failed to come away from the experience being impressed - it's jaw-droppingly good. This is a classic of the genre - and a must-have for any true collector.
B00J0I67XM|5|Keanu did it again!!!!

4893580914|4|This book is truly helpful in guiding you to learn and memorise the different kanji. They have pictures, show you the order of writing the strokes as well as how you can apply the characters (both in Chinese and Japanese). It would be better if you use this book under the guidance of a teacher. I had numerous questions pertaining to the usage of some of the kanji characters but wasn't able to make any clarifications as I had no teacher to direct my queries to.
078322608X|5|Good Science Fiction (weather a book, a movie, tv, whatever) has the power to make us look at ourselves as a society.  The events in this movie metaphorically mimic events in our everyday lives.  Even though we have not  yet discovered time travel, all of the other events in this movie could  happen, which is absolutely frightening.  This is a dark movie, not for  everyone, which has a deep high-minded script and plot (it may take a few  watchings to fully understand this one.)  The cinematography, directing,  and acting are wonderful.  Bruce Willis proves that he can do other movies  besides his normal action type.  He also proved it later in The 6th Sense,  but I think this is one of his best performences.  As for Brad Pitt, it is  his best performance.  It's so real that by the end, you'll think he's  crazy.<br />Another important thing to note is to buy the DVD, but not the DTS  one.  The non-DTS version has an insightful long documentary on the making  of the film, the DTS version does not have this.  Plus the Dolby Digital  sound is excellent in itself.<br />Most Highly Reccomended.

B0085KGHI6|5|Muddy was the best. I also saw Lefty Dizz, sat in with his band and played his right handed guitar. I met Buddy Guy at the Checkerboard, and saw Junior Wells and the rollings tones many times. I started screaming like the Bears just won the Superbowl with a goal line stand when I started watching this video. There is a great moment in this video when Lefty is takin' a solo during a song Muddy is singin' and is gettin' ready to CLOWN and he points to himself and looks at Muddy as to say \\"Can I go another 12 ??\\" Muddy smiles, points to himself, and starts singing. I know Lefty had the ultimate respect for Muddy as did everyone. It still boggles my mind to this day that I never heard anyone ever say a bad thing about Muddy Waters 'cause all those guys loved to talk $h!t about everybody. Subtitles/closed caption was fun !! PLAY ON!!

B00B7I8HZ4|3|I'm using this as an HTPC.  I've got a Silicondust HDHomerun Prime with cable card ( Comcast ).  4 gigs of memory and a 32 gig crucial SSD.  The operating system is Windows and I'm using Windows Media Center to watch and record TV.  I've got an external 500 gig drive attached to one of the rear USB ports for recording storage and a 2 TB drive hooked up to my router's USB.  I'm using the 2tb drive to store music, pictures, movies and videos.  I tried the router mounted drive as the primary target of WMC \\"recorded TV\\" folder as well ( more on that later)<br /><br />Setup via the USB was simple enough.  I first installed windows 7, downloaded the latest intel bios and windows driver and installed them.  My first hiccup came when I ran WMC cable advisor.  It reported that I don't have an adequate video card and wmc cannot be used to watch cable tv.  After some fruitless googling I thought I'd take a look at the Windows experience index.  It was reporting my graphic card at 3.1.  I reran the test and the graphics were up to 4.9.  Next I went into WMC and reran \\"cable advisor\\".  It passed.  Lesson - rerun Windows Experience Index after installing latest drivers and before running cable advisor.<br /><br />I experienced issues with my cable card ( picked it up in person).  My initial call to Comcast resulting in them telling me that there was something wrong with my HD Homerun, and, I should contact them for support.  I was doubtful so I went back to Comcast to exchange the card.  The Comcast guy opened a cabinet, grabbed a card and said \\"here\\".  I looked at the card - it was dented so I pointed that out to him.  He went and pulled another out of the cabinet  - this one was severely bent down it's length.  It looked like someone stuck it under a refrigerator and tried to bend it - it was clearly defective.  I asked for a new one.  He told me this was an exchange place only, that they don't have any new ones.  I asked him if they checked to ensure that they work before they hand them out and he said \\"no, customers return them and we put them in the box so we have them when somebody wants one\\"  ( I am not making this up!)  He had a total of 6 in the box, I grabbed 2 of the least worn he had - and they all looked bad.  ( the 2nd one cost me $1.50 a month, good short term insurance if I got yet another bad card ) .  After about an hour on the phone with Comcast I finally got escalated to the cablecard department.  Their number is 877-405-2298.  They set me up in about 2 minutes.  If you are dealing with a cablecard from Comcast I suggest you call that number instead of the general support number.  Incidentally, the guy at Comcast said there was not a cablecard department and I just need to call the standard 1 800 COMCAST to get it setup.  Of course, he also said it was activated and I just needed to plug it in ( also not true).  Anyway, it is working now.  Lesson learned - make sure you are talking to someone that can really help.<br /><br />Now, in WMC I can record 3 HD programs and watch another without issue.  Windows Task Manager reports that I'm using 40 to 60% of the CPU.  That's pretty good.  No issues at all with the USB 2.0 port not being fast enough, it's plenty fast so don't worry about that.  I was thrilled.<br /><br />I then tried watching a previous episode of Sons of Anarchy from the Xfinity website ( Used both Chrome and Internet Explorer browsers).  The stream to watch Sons required flash so I installed it.  I could watch the show, but my CPU activity was in the 80 to 100% range.  And, when I tried to record an HD channel in WMC while watching Sons the CPU pegged at 100% and starved WMC. Today I tried watching the same episode on my company supplied I7 laptop, the cpu averaged about 8% utilization.  I know it's not fair to compare a celeron to an I7 but I thought I'd share that to help frame the issue.<br /><br />Other issues, every once in awhile I get an error message in WMC stating that either my video driver or cardis not installed correctly, or there is no audio driver.  Whenever these errors occurs I have to restart WMC, which is only a nuisance.  Sometimes restarting WMC doesn't work and I have to restart the NUC.  That's bad cuz if I'm in the middle of recording something I will lose it.  It turns out that the NUC has no onboard audio.  It passes the audio down the HDMI cable for your TV or receiver to deal with it.  Not sure but I'm thinking that might be an issue for me.<br /><br />So here's why 3 stars - 1) not strong enough to support Flash and it seems many of the Network websites require it for streaming.  2) Flaky video/audio issues.<br /><br />On the plus side it's really small and looks cool next to your TV.  You can use a really cheap portable USB drive to store your media.  In terms of performance it's perfect if you're using WMC and NOT navigating to sites that require flash.  It's incredibly quiet.  I have to lean really close to it in order to hear any sound at all.<br /><br />Down the road I'll take a look at the new NUC I3, the one with USB 3.0 and built in IR.  It's about a hundred bucks more but I regret that I didn't give that one a try.  Maybe it would handle the Flash and still leave plenty of processor to handle my recording needs.<br /><br />Finally, I mentioned earlier that I tried using an external drive connected to my router's USB port.  That almost worked for WMC.  I had to make changes in the registry and bingo - WMC was recording to the drive.  However, it just wasn't reliable.  I don't know if the issues are with WMC, Netgear (router manufacturer) or something else.  Both the NUC and my router are 1 gig wired ethernet.  Bandwidth was no problem.  While recorded 3 HD and watching the recording of another I was only using about 10% of my bandwidth.  The issues I had were that I managed to lose some metadata relating to some recorded shows. Now they show up, but only as the file name with no date recorded or episode info.  Thought that was weird.  This was also the drive in play when Flash grabbed all my CPUs power so maybe that had something to do with it.  For now, I know that it is at least possible to use network storage for WMC but until I really need to, I'll stick with the NUC's USB and hook up a drive to that.<br /><br />In summary, while this NUC is pretty cool it just doesn't have enough power to provide peace of mind.  I'll be keeping it but I'll be careful not to tax the CPU while media center is in play.is not installed correctly, or there is no audio driver.

B009FZHYKU|5|Having been a huge fan of George A. Romero since I was a kid I love finding all the little hidden tributes to his work in The Walking Dead, and there are many. Fit instance, Duane Jones was the name of the actor who played Ben in Night of the Living Dead and Morgan was the name of the main character in The Last Man On Earth, the inspiration for Romero's story. The baby's name is Judith which was the name of the actress who played the original Barbara. The writers also have a sense of humor- I could be wrong, but I think the redneck brothers were named Dixon for the Mason Dixon line which separated the northern from the southern states. I love that it has all these little surprises for the fan to discover like little gifts left hidden all throughout the episodes.This series is amazing-great writing and acting-wonderful casting. The writers take you on a rollercoaster ride-a silly or funny moment turns tragic or sad or exciting in a heartbeat and every episode leaves you wanting the next and the next and, unlike other shows, it has no problem killing off it's main and beloved characters which leaves the fans more than worried and excited and a little fearful. I am very picky about what I watch and worse about what I like and this incredible show has me hooked like marlin. I can't stop watching this unique and wonderful series which I hope will be around for many seasons to come. I couldn't recommend a show more than this little gem.
B00DU761TY|5|I have spent so much time playing this game. It helps relax me before bed. It is challenging yet simple.
B006LSZECO|5|I was hesitant to read this one, so glad I did!  All of Gillian Flynn's books are incredible and this one does not disappoint!  Very messed up, full of surprises and impossible to put down.  Loved it!
B00000DI06|2|Though the instrumental performance is adequate, I was quite disappointed with the choral performance in the requiem.  The group's diction is not together, several of the soloists are weak, and the overall balance of choir and orchestra is not even.
B00FCQQ1IW|5|Book #3 in the series.  Love the book.  I can honestly say, that I don't like how each of the books end.  However while I am reading the books, I very much enjoy them.  Personal note to Mr. Archer...  Stop ending your books that way!  Please!
B001974DG0|5|Over the years there have been a few novels I read again and again:  King's \\"The Stand,\\" Heinlein's \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" and two of Koontz':  \\"Strangers,\\" and Watchers.\\"<br /><br />This wondrous book looks at what it means to be \\"human,\\" and shows that more often than not, \\"humanity\\" wins out against Corporate and Governmental greed.<br /><br />So as not to spoil any part of this great adventure, I will say only this:  If you can't buy it, try to borrow it. The very first chapter will have you wanting to read more about a loner who runs into a dog in the forest. .... and no one will ever be the same.<br /><br /> Not the characters in the book, nor the countless readers who, like me, come back to read about governmental secret experiments, a shy woman, an ex-Delta man, and the joys and horrors that they encounter.<br /><br />Friends, not masters.  Thank you, fur face.
B00PSLQGX6|4|PBS always nails it!  I love Downton Abbey and can't wait for Season 6.  Got a little lost with the Bates'--drawn out just a bit too much.  Cried over Isis.  Need to see another dog.  Sniveling Edith is a bore--she needs a life.  Mary is too self-absorbed.  Love Granny--do I see Granny or just the great acting of Maggie Smith.  Too long of a wait between seasons.
159463176X|4|\\"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment.\\" -- 1 John 4:18 (NKJV)<br /><br />Regardless of your ultimate view of this book, I think you'll agree that pages 1 through 49 are as well written as anything you've read in a long time. Bravo, Mr. Hosseini! They are a remarkable achievement!!<br /><br />While anyone would envy an author who accomplished so much to open a novel, there's a problem. Readers expect the rest of the book to maintain that remarkably high standard.<br /><br />I believe that Mr. Hosseini has the talent to do so. The plot for this book, its scope, and length make it impossible to do so. You couldn't write War and Peace in many fewer words ... or a Tale of Two Cities. And the Mountains Echoed needs to be two or three times longer to flesh out his plan for the book.<br /><br />Without that length, the book comes across as a series of short stories briefly connected to one or the other of the two siblings in the book's beginning, Abdullah and Pari. Each story is its own morality tale about how we treat other people, including those in our families. Within the whole book there are themes connecting suffering, responsibility, and morality. Some characters adhere to timeless values, at least in parts of their lives, while others talk a good game ... but don't act in accord with their words. The result is a tapestry capturing Afghanistan yesterday and today against a backdrop of humanity over all times.<br /><br />One of the book's major accomplishments is to present some of the most thought-provoking writing I recall about how appearance affects our lives and our behavior. I would love to see Mr. Hosseini return to this subject in future books. He obviously has a deep understanding that can inform us all.<br /><br />But please do write a book next time that's as long as your subject deserves, Mr. Hosseini! We'll read it.

B0009P5YXO|4|I know it's a toy. You know it's a toy. But when you open the package, your first thought shall be: this is a toy. Chunky and plastic-y, with seams and flashing all over the place, the build quality isn't up to snuff. Considering other companies offer replica prop \\"toys\\" at the same price point with more elaborate electronics and metal parts, the Sonic Screwdriver doesn't feel like $20 in your hand.    The UV light does indeed look blue in real life (as opposed to purple in photos) as others have noted, but it isn't the right shade, making the end look cheap when it's activated. The sound is quiet and the speaker is (inexplicably) mounted so that it points AWAY from the user, making it seem even quieter. There are two alternating sounds, one with a simple buzz, the other a buzz that pitches up slightly higher along with a looping \\"purring chirp\\", though the Sonic needs to be firmly planted against your ear to hear the difference in most situations. The \\"teeter-totter\\" design of the switch is just cheap, as the button could have easily been designed to be depressed by the slider switch... but that probably would cost an extra 2 cents per unit.    In another ode to cheapness, the clear tube is molded in two separate pieces, leaving a huge seam down each side. Great.    The battery compartment is hilariously oversized, meaning that the extra length added for the electronics is just wasted space, and this could have easily been proportioned like the actual prop. Quick note: the blurb about the toy being used in the show is a bit of a stretch; it was only used as a \\"stunt\\" prop, whenever the Sonic was supposed to be thrown, dropped or otherwise abused. The proper metal one was still used most of the time.    The pen nib is an interesting addition, though you do have to twist the cap off when using it; pulling it will just unplug the whole tip. The UV feature works as advertised, but quickly loses what little charm it has. The regular pen tip is much more practical, if awkward to use unless you have gigantic hands.    All in all, this feels more like a prototype, a bug-filled version to be tweaked and changed before production, but here it is. Too bad, as this could have been a great piece.    But I gave it four stars. Because, no matter how cheap, now matter how poorly designed, no matter how maddening the numerous issues may be, this thing is still fun. Super fun. Stupid fun. I can't help but pick it up and play with it every time I see it! As a replica, this thing fails. As a toy, it's still riddled with problems. But it's a damned fun toy. 4 stars it is. For sheer fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is fun, addicting and challenging? Play it too much and too often! Very disappointing when I run out of lives.
0684800713|4|People told me that I would not like Hemingway's style.  To be honest it took quite a few chapters to get into the story because in the beginning Hemingway wrote about a group of expatriates flitting around Paris continuously getting drunk (can anyone REALLY drink as much as these people did in the novel?) This seemed to go on and on. A reader of this book really needs to understand the context of the times before reading this because you would simply think that these people are stupid.  Understanding that this book was written after the horror of the Great War one can really begin to see what this &quot;Lost Generation&quot; was all about.<br />The book really picked up for me when the group goes to Pamplona for the fiesta.  I think that bullfighting is disgusting but the way Hemingway wrote about the bullfights was amazing.  The detail puts you right there next to Jake and Brett.<br />I do like the writing style of Hemingway. No fluff, just lay it out how it is. Take it or leave it.
0452289963|2|I give this book two stars because I agree with the basic premise that people should embrace the present moment. The problem is that the author repeats this basic idea over and over. While certainly some repitition is justified in order to get the point across, the repetition here rises to absurd levels. I think this book could've easily been written under 100 pages, but then, alas, it would be difficult to sell. Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope

B005544TRQ|5|So much intrigue, even though a bit far-fetched I love to watch every single minute!
B0084IG8TM|4|This movie is a very faithful recreation of the first novel of the Hunger Games trilogy. I thought it was well acted and staged. Jennifer Lawrence is very good in it, as is Woody Harrelson and the rest of the cast. Definitely worth watching.

There are tons of unique and fun pieces in this set (my son loved the trap door on the temple) as well as the large Gold Ninja Mech. Highly recommended for Ninjago fans!
B00JGMK6VG|5|It was a great movie.
B006OOHYIC|4|A very pleasant but challenging game!
B007ZGO7EM|5|Simple and easy to use. Must have app for any kindle fire user! I have tried other calculator apps and none compare.
B0063IH60K|4|It's OK...prefer HP version on my desktop. Wish it would not add points to sort at top once you've won the game....inflates the score deceptively.
B009VB97EY|5|Good movie
B0094BB4TW|1|I've been trying to update this app for months now. It downloads, then won't install. Can't save photos to my kindle fire HDX  any more. Fix this or I'll just stop using this app!
B00FKF0F3C|4|Although It was fun reading, volumes 2 and 1 are much better.
B00000DHRZ|4|I mainly bought this for the 4 hit songs &quot;Pretty Fly for a White Guy&quot;, &quot;Why don't You Get A Job?&quot;,  &quot;The Kids Aren't Alright&quot;, &amp; &quot;Shes Got Issues&quot;, which are all great  songs, and a few other good ones include Americana, Staring at the Sun, and  Pay the Man. It also does something cool when u put it in the computer. But  seriously, if u just got into the Offspring and are looking for this album,  get one of their older albums first, like Smash, Ignition, &amp; Ixnay on  the Hombre, or their hard-to-find self-titled debut. Still this is good,  but if I had to choose between this and Smash, Smash would definitely be  it.
B006PERRMY|4|Good action movie
B004T32SOK|1|I never write amazon reviews, however the experience I had with Box.com, talking with their sales representative, was so bad that I felt the need to warn others.<br /><br />Having just spoken with a sales representative at Box.com, I felt the need to share this information with fellow users. It was, without a doubt the worst customer service experience I have ever had. All I was trying to do was get more information about their business accounts and what kind of services they would provide to business customers. Rather than provide me with information about their product, a sales representative wasted 20 minutes of time asking me questions about my company address, why I wanted to get Box, and going down the list of all types of survey questions, that may have been useful to Box, were absolutely useless to me. And he insisted that he could not provide me with any information about their services without getting all this information from me. Looking to sign up and pay for a dozen or so business account apparently meant nothing to them, and for me, being concerned that this is representation of what their sales people and technical service representatives will be like - I will just go to one of the other dozen competitors that provides exactly the same service. While I only have one sales call to base this off, this was my personal experience with them.

B009UX2YAC|5|I really like subway surfers. It is really fun to play!!!!
B00LTMIHVW|4|Sometimes I think a rating system that allowed for ratings across multiple criteria would be really useful, although such a thing would still be prey to the Amazon sock puppet phenomenon, wherein crap amateur films are somehow rated as equal to, say, The Shining within a few days of their initial release.  I say that in regards to this particular film because, while its cinematography, acting, writing, production, etc are all the sort of high level that is Hollywood standard (and much better than a lot of Hollywood dreck), the appeal of this movie is going to be pretty limited.<br /><br />This is a fairly rare type of alien film that deals with a sort of Pinocchio effect: a thing/creature designed to look like a human tries to discover what it is to be human.  It of course must end in tragedy, but it says something about the character development and Johansson's excellent portrayal that the viewer can feel some empathy for a creature that entices and then ... Not really sure how to describe what happens to the victims, but rest assured, it's fatal.<br /><br />This is a slow build, with some creepy surreality, one or two slight shocks, and one absolutely hilarious &#34;I HAVE A WHAT NOW??&#34; moment (you'll know, it involves a lamp, and I laughed out loud).  But people looking for gore, jump scares, or a nerve-stringing tension fest are going to be very disappointed. This is more likely to leave you pondering the human condition than sleeping with the lights on.  But if you want a thinker, this is solid.
B007SYWFRM|5|It is the best game. You should get it now. It is one of the best free games there is.

B004XUMPFQ|5|in my opinion this is one of the best shows ever on tv. science fiction meets western. a great cast and good story lines about a crew on a small independant freighter who take on some passengers to help pay the bills and the fun commences.the show was cancelled before the first season finished airing.i dont know if it was put up against stiff competition or a bad time slot,but the show definately deserved better.you cant go wrong buying this.dont forget to get the movie \\"serenity\\" which was made after the series was cancelled and ties up some of the loose pieces
1401323820|3|First off, I am more of a sci-fi fantasy reader.  I've like Nathan Fillion as an actor since first watched Firefly.  So, thought I'd check out the castle series-I absolutely love the TV series. I was excited about buying this book, but soon found there is really nothing new in this book that you have not seen in the series.  This book is what Castle writes from the research he gets from series.  So, alot of the material is from the series with just a different spin out it.  Good book in general, I was just hoping for a little more.
0517591812|5|I traveled to London last summer -- only spent a week -- the book is as captivating as the city.  Do read.
B000Y179KO|3|I was at Wal-Mart waiting while I had my tires rotated when I gave in and bought this album. Being an Eagles fan I thought it was my duty. I must admit I almost missed it on the shelf. The CD cover looked like one of those low budget relaxation CDs or a tribute albums with Eagles songs played by an all mandolin orchestra or something silly like that.    Anyway, I put in disc one and nearly fell asleep during the first track. Then I was woken up by a modern country/bluesy/indescript song that I understand is the first single. Yikes, they were really out of ideas! \\"How Long\\" encompasses everything I find lacking in modern country music. The melody is ordinary, it has that commonplace rockin' bluesy feel and it's boring. Did I mention how boring it was? Where's the invention here? Where's the creativity? Why do old men like that rockin' blues thing so much?  Are these really the same guys who wrote all that great music in the 70s?  Really?    It's not all bad. Most of the good songs are nice. That's the only way I can say it, they're nice. Nothing is so creative it will alienate the average listener and everything has a certain blandness about it. Still, there are some nice songs here. I did load about an album's worth of nice songs on my iPod. The rest will probably never be played by me again.
B000667GFK|5|Miguel is a wonderful singer.  I love his singing so much!  This cd includes a lot of songs which I love and he sings them perfectly!
B000002KIE|5|This was way ahead of its time and is still brilliant now.  Punk definately died when these guys stopped.  Every track has a message.  If you think something then F****** write a song about it and shout it out!  Punk in comparision to all the cra* that was out there at the time was actually refreshing. F*** censorship, F*** the way people think and F*** the Monarchy.
B00WP9HSJU|4|A very fun and enjoyable journey. I love the style of writing.
B008JFUUIA|5|Love this movie and the music is fabulous.  The story line in predictable, but very enjoyable.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4|Very well researched and reasoned.  It provides a realistic and highly readable portrait of the historical Jesus with some logical conjecture which is very much at odds with the popular beliefs.  I do wish Asian had provided more space to Paul and how his personal teachings came to overshadow the reality of Jesus's teachings.  It should be read by every Christian to give them perspective on what they hear in church.
B003UBTX6S|5|I love teen, I read a lot of it. I read through this quickly and I was impressed with the level she takes the books. I wish the film had done better at the box office because I would have loved to see the rest of the books made into movies.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|It's cool ok it's awesome that you want to get it your probably saying oh this game is a waste of download time but your not waiting for nothing it's awesome just download it :)
B000FCKPHG|5|It amazes me that this book doesn't have a bigger impact, even among the people who read it. Some people complain that they don't like the prose, or that Dweck can be too repetitive? So what? The idea is so profound and life changing that I really don't care about such minor stylistic issues like that. She can be as repetitive as she likes, so long as the ideas are so strong and positive.<br /><br />My only regret is that I didn't discover this book when I was younger. It really taught me a lot about myself, and not everything I learned was pleasant or flattering. I had to face some hard truths. I especially recommend this book to people with young children. Don't let your kids fall prey to the fixed mindset!
B00SH00N3Y|1|Horrible movie.
B000002UV9|1|I started listening to 'ryche with Rage for order, which is outstanding.  I anxiously awaited Mindcrime, which was even better.  I enthusiastically awaited Empire.  When it was released I rushed out and bought it and was  sorely disappointed.  The music lost it's energy and seemed to go  comercial.  Save your money and get mindcrime.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Fun to play
1569382603|5|I have felt inclined to express my views on this box set since i purchased it.  I have studied thes topics for over 5 years now.  And with this video series it has given me a great visualization of subjects that i have only  been able to read about.  I want to further extend my thanks to the authors  for there dedication in keeping the world informed, on a subject that has  many opinions.  I recommend this video to anyone.  I have leant my videos  to many people now and the reviews are the same.  It has open the minds of  the sceptics i have encountered in my discussions.  I also look anxiously  forward to any sequels that may continue such a mysterious and intriguing  subject.  These videos are for everyone!  Do yourself a favor and become a  part of the experience.  It has given me much motivation to study more and  understand. My deepest thanks again to the authors and producers!
B000AYEL6U|4|~~~\\"North & South\\" is a period drama set in the 1800s in both the north and south of England. The story centers around Margaret Hale, a passionate southern belle; John Thornton, a strong-willed northern tradesman; and their respective families.  Margaret has grown up in country Helstone, surrounded by comfort, beauty, and society; now a young woman, Margaret's father decides to move to the north of England - much to the shock of all around him. In the move to the new town Milton, the Hale family comes in contact with the life of industrial mill workers and masters. It is here that we meet John Thornton, a wealthy, handsome, cotton mill owner; but he and Margaret are as far apart as east and west - at least on the surface. Yet the longer the Hales stay in Milton, the more they like it, and the more John and Margaret are attracted to and repulsed by one another; until the excellent ending.          ~~~\\"North & South\\" is a wonderful drama of two people caught in a web of misunderstanding and love. The characters are very much believable and the wardrobe was excellent. The cast is great for the movie; from moodily handsome Thornton, to hardily-built persistent Higgins. Personally, my favorite was Thornton, for he was much more complex than Margaret and a very interesting character.         ~~~The setting of Milton might be a bit dark for some, with no brightly colored backdrop except in London and Helstone, but the characters themselves are very colorful with a very realistic multi-dimension to them.   ~~~There is some issue with cleavage and corsets in this movie, both being in full use. Although most of Margaret's clothing is modest, I wouldn't recommend anyone under 10 years old to watch this movie (also the plot is a little confusing for younger ones).   ~~~Anyway, besides what I mentioned above I sincerely enjoyed this movie!  A lot of people compare \\"North & South\\" to BBC's \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" but in P&P the main characters have both pride and prejudices, while inN&S, the line is more clearly drawn.  For, Hale has her own ideas and prejudices against \\"the north,\\" while Thornton has his own pride to deal with concerning his continuing attraction to Hale (just as an aside: Daniela Denby-Ashe was made for this part, she isn't what one might immediately declare as 'pretty', but there is something about her that is very sweet and endearing). Yet it all ends very sweetly after the four hours are up and I will definitely be adding this movie to my own video collection alongside \\"Sense & Sensibility\\", \\"Persuasion\\", \\"Pride & Prejudice\\", \\"Emma\\", and \\"Wives & Daughters\\".

I watch the reruns everynight. I think I have been glamoured. I can't believe I had never heard of Stephen Moyer before. Reminds me of a southern Mr. Darcy. Anna Paquin is adorable.

B00013RC8O|4|for opening my eyes to this movie. Some of the &quot;Show me how to live&quot; music video contains footage and/or ideas from &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;. The VHS was hard to find, and a DVD didnt even exist - until now. So, if you're a muscle car fan, or an Audioslave fan, you're gonna want to check this out. And while you're at it - go buy &quot;Bullit&quot; too.

B003G4W49C|4|What an interesting story. It was frustrating, and happy, and intelligent. I enjoyed this book and I'm generally not a big fan of space, aliens, or battles. This was a great book though.
B00001OH7N|5|I am deeply embedded in classic rock, and a significant portion of what falls into this classification is dated, or lame initially. This one never fails to amaze me! It is one of those lesser known masterpieces, Nirvana never topped this, in fact they borrowed a tune from this LP. 2nd best--Diamond Dogs. This man will go down in history as a Maestro, if not f**k them, I know what I'm talking about!

B007ZGO7EM|5|This calculator is easy to use and easy to read. It works great on my Kindle Fire, and it is convenient.  I like the large display, and the fact that it shows previous calculations until I choose to erase them.
B00005NTN5|1|People (mostly guys) think this movie is great because it' centers around two lesbs.  They think the romance seen is great because of the lesbs.  Yet, people who watched Alexander were so afended because of the homesexual innuendos, so they gave the movie very low socres.  This movie is a trash hands down! The only thing good about this movie was the mafia scene and that's it.  By the way, if peple can accept two females having sex on the screen, then they should accept the movie Alexander's homosexual scenes!
B007SGLZP8|5|Another excellent Grisham novel.

B002QE3CTY|1|The book was written on about the 8th grade level, based on the vocabulary and maturity level of dialog between the characters.  I wish this had been made clear to me before it bought the book.  Not worth the time.  At best it was a depressing read.
0756655307|5|Awesome book for Marvel fans to have in their collection. Bought this as a birthday present for my 12 year old son who is obsessed with Marvel comics and movies and 6 months later he is still carrying it around studying every word.

B00009P1O0|5|“On the Beach” is a bit of a curious addition to Neil Young’s catalog – it doesn’t have the notoriety of “Harvest,” “Harvest Moon,” “After the Gold Rush,” or “Rust Never Sleeps,” partially because of its largely bleak, often inaccessible subject matters, and also because it was unavailable for many years. However, for those who have heard it and absorbed it over the years, “On the Beach” represents a watershed for Neil, and many name it as his best; lofty praise for sure, but it’s very hard to find fault with any of the album’s eight tracks, from the sunny opener “Walk On,” to the heartbreaking “See the Sky About to Rain,” to the terrifying “Revolution Blues,” to the gripping closer “Ambulence Blues,” “On the Beach” achieves excellence throughout is entire length and features some of Neil’s best songs. While hard to find in most areas, it is most assuredly worth seeking out if you want to own the cream of the crop of the best Neil Young records.
B00K369LRO|5|Love it. Best sleep sounds app I've ever used.

B003NX76BM|4|Frequently with her novels, Roberts presents an interesting plot to explore. The idea of a search dog/ dog trainer being stalked by a convict, who's back to finish the botched job, has potential. Added to that, we have the love interest, a new arrival in the small community, is a necessary but interesting aspect. He adds to the story because of how delightfully casual their relationship is and how it grows into something more without them really noticing. There's a sense of ease, yet discomfort that feels natural (despite the catalyst of a stalker/killer).<br /><br />Clearly a Roberts' novel, it follows her basic formula, which tends to be a drawback for many. But as a faithful reader, there is a comfort to be found there. Combined with her interesting plot ideas and ability to make these characters real for me, I feel it balances out into an enjoyable and easy read over all.<br /><br />For this review and others, check out BookMunchies.com.

B008Z9YLV2|5|This whole series is exceptional...

B000R8YC18|5|In Brief: Martin Scorsese leads us into the darkness of the human soul by exploring the character of one Travis Bickle, a disillusioned Vietnam veteran played by Robert De Niro. Failing to make a connection with those around him, Travis decides to take matters into his own hands, via such instruments as firearms and interesting fashion statements.<br /><br /> Yes, De Niro is brilliant, and yes, Scorsese's techniques are still as effective today as they were innovative in 1976.<br /><br />Meanwhile, one element that often goes unmentioned outside of deeper analyses of the film is its musical score, one of Bernard Herrmann's last and very finest. With the veteran composer of Alfred Hitchcock films tabbed for this film, you might have expected dark and disturbing, Psycho-esqe music, befitting Taxi Driver's status as a nightmarish psychological journey. Horrific dirges find their way into the score on occasion, but surprisingly, Herrmann more often used a jazzy, romantic theme to underscore Travis' subconscious rants about the \\"scum\\" and \\"filth\\" he'd like to wipe out of New York City.<br /><br /> Scorsese has shown over the course of his career that he is a director chiefly interested in the duality of human nature - capturing the seductiveness of the mob (Goodfellas), the loneliness of a champion (Raging Bull), and even the humanity of Jesus himself (The Last Temptation of Christ) - and here he presents his most complex character. Is Travis a hero or a monster? The question is never answered to any satisfying degree,<br /> The director makes no overt rejection of Travis Bickle's ultimate violence, but it may be found in the way the outburst is filmed: the massacre is artfully done, but brutal and unrelenting, and tellingly, there is no music. Herrmann's score works here by its very absence: he and Scorsese subtly inform us that there is no counterpoint to the violence, that it is what it is - and that for the audience, just as Travis must feel, there is no escape.<br /><br />Thanks Shay Casey
B000BJS4SU|4|I've always admired John Mayer for his songwriting abilities, but when I first saw him live his guitar playing ability took me by surprise.  Now, after millions of albums sold and 3 grammys, he has taken the risky move to form his own blues-rock trio.  All things considered, it was a risk worth taking.  The album features 11 performances from the Trio's maiden Fall 2005 tour, seven of which are new Mayer originals.  Of those, \\"Good Love Is On The Way,\\" \\"Gravity,\\" \\"Vultures,\\" and the terrific title track stand out.  \\"Something's Missing\\" is fairly faithful to previous live and studio versions, but \\"Daughters\\" is transformed into a revelatory bluesy ballad.  But the album has its weak parts.  \\"Who Do You Think I Was\\" sounds like a sloppy Lenny Kravitz rip-off, and the pure blues of \\"Out Of My Mind\\" is meandering and unfocused.  But the best is the cover of Ray Charles' \\"I Got A Woman,\\" where Mayer, bassist Pino Palladino, and in particular drummer Steve Jordan shine.  While this is not your babysitter's Mayer, and blues (and SRV) purists may scoff, this is a credible first step in a new direction for John Mayer, one that bodes well for the future.

0783225733|5|Director Ron Howard's acclaimed 1995 space drama about the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission. This has been one of my favorite movies since the first  time I saw it in the theater. High drama, great character moments, and an  exploration of the human spirit, all brought together masterfully on the  screen with innovative filmmaking techniques, great special effects, and a  brilliant score by composer James Horner.<br />Ron Howard captures the spirit  and reality of the Apollo era in an amazingly accurate and entertaining  film.  There are certain sacrifices in accuracy for dramatic value, but  overall, the message and story are delivered intact.  The work and  attention to detail put into this film is phenomenal.<br />The DVD release  doesn't disappoint.  This was one of the first &quot;fully-loaded&quot;  discs before special edition releases became common.  First is a very  interesting an informative documentary on the making of the film.  There's  not one, but two commentary tracks included (one with director Ron Howard,  and one will real-life hero Jim Lovell and wife Marilyn).  Commentaries are  my favorite aspect of the DVD format, because they allow the director  and/or people who worked on the film to provide the viewer with their own  personal perspective on their work.  Both of these commentaries are  informative and interesting.<br />The acting is great.  The story is great.  The DVD is great.  Pick this up - you won't be sorry.
