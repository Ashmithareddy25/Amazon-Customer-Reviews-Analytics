B00BRN5YE6|3|It's functional but only if you have the internal trunk hooks required to hold the netting up.  The cost of the hooks is a bit much so  I'll eventually fabricate two, so they fit securely in the top of the truck area.
B00A1XGR4E|4|Works great on my 2001 corolla LE. This oil filter is made for the 2ZZ engine, but it fits perfectly on the 1ZZ engine with the added benefit  of being taller.<br /><br />Being the 8th gens burn oil, i wanted a taller filter to get rid of some of the soot that is left behind from burnt oil. This fills the need perfectly as a security blanket.<br /><br />deducting one star because it is a *decent* oil filter, I much rather a Purolator PureONE quality filter, this just is a lot cheaper. I will continue to buy this (in cases because it is cheap) but just letting others know that just because it is OEM doesnt mean its top of the line perfect.
B00JXYGYLI|5|Great A/C Kit everything fits.
B001G8AIMU|5|Prefect size for the job.
B000EDOSKQ|3|Works great, but I was shorted 6 screws in one, and 4 in the other. So count your screws before you start. I had none the right size handy, and I didn't want to use different screws. So I had to finish the next day after a trip to Lowes.
B00CUN0UP0|5|Factory seat, should have replaced the seat years ago!!  OK.. we just put the goats behinde a fence.  Yes goats love to chew on everthing!!

B00V2VF5GU|2|Great product does not fit my application but will use them elsewhere
B000GKD5NI|3|I really wanted this thing to work in my car and help keep it cooled in the summer. The problem is that I can only ever get one of the suction cups to actually stick, so it doesn't really work.
B003N5IHHM|5|love this one.
B00K2OV0MG|5|Factory OEM replacement motor mounts for Porsche 996 911's. My original mounts were quite worn and these really helped to smooth out the car's shifts and also helped to minimize vibrations while at idle.

B000LVKKTO|2|worthless doesn't do even reflect bugs. If anyone wants to by it from me Half off.
B00PBWN91E|5|Looks and feels great. A little smaller than expected and gets super hot if left uncovered in the sun but still great overall. Plus it matches the interior in my Wrx
B002ET8LZ6|5|Simply works. Covers the area the visor doesn't on side window. Only downside is you loose the visor mirror due to the straps.<br />Exceptional customer service from the company insured they sent the correct size for my car.

B010SC3ODY|5|My reason for writing this review was that I was struggling to find good reviews for non-OEM BMW accessories to make an informed decision, and since I was very happy with the product, here I am writing this review.<br /><br />I've been looking for a sporty looking gas/break pedals for my 2015 X5 for a while.  Most of the products I found on Amazon required drilling holes through the metal pedals (including the genuine OEM product) to install except this one.  When I ordered this, I was some what skeptical if this will work because most others required drilling, plus on the product picture, the brake pedal looks flat but the car pedal appears to be somewhat curvy.  Anyway, I thought for twenty some dollars, I can take a chance.<br /><br />The package was shipped and delivered quickly through Amazon Prime.  I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package.  The break and gas pedals were looking as seen in product pictures, and appeared of solid quality.  Furthermore, the brake pedal is curvy just like the car pedal.<br /><br />Brake Pedal Installation:<br />------------<br />After removing the factory rubber cover off the brake pedal (this was easy), I put the new brake cover in by tilting and sliding it from one side in.  It took some effort to slid the last side in plus making sure the cover is firmly in place .  The whole installation took about 10min.<br /><br />Gas Pedal Installation:<br />-----------<br />This was extremely easy, nothing to take off.  I simply slid the cover top down, and it just simply slid into place.<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely happy.  For less than $25 dollars, and no drilling, I got a pair of good sporty looking pedals.  This product doesn't come with the footrest, but I am not sure how that one would fit without drilling to keep it in place.  Plus you can always get a car mat that has cover for the footrest.
B00HG9UHMO|5|Great
B00RV83UUG|5|Very bright
B000COC67E|1|I can’t recommend this product. It states it has a limit of 250 lbs. which is acceptable but the seat cushion is far below standards. I’m not a heavy guy but if you weigh more than 100 lbs. you won’t find the seat cushion very durable or comfortable. The foam padding is not sufficient for the average adult.
B000CAVE6M|5|GREAT
B00WDSVEE8|5|Bought these sunglasses for my husband. They are perfect for his glasses. He doesn't like glasses that transition. He also doesn't like the other type of spring loaded clipons where you need to use two hands to attach them (and then have no place to put them when you take them off).  With these, he can instantly clip them on when he goes outside and when he walks back inside he can flip them up or clip them to his shirt or pocket so he doesn't lose them. He is so happy!
B005XRKKOG|5|Right up front: Super value, and the seller was helpful. I would buy this again, and would buy from the same seller. For what you pay, it's hard to find a better deal, you'd have to easily double the price. I consider this a fine value for what I paid. I'm using it in a very old vehicle because the gauges in the vehicle are inaccurate, and I didn't need a very expensive Autometer for my purposes, nor did I want multiple gauges--this was perfect.<br /><br />PRODUCT QUALITY: 5/5 (everything was like-new condition, no aesthetic flaws in the assembly)<br />FUNCTIONALITY: 5/5 (everything tested functioned as expected)<br />ACCURACY: 4/5 (everything appeared to be as accurate as possible)<br />EASY INSTALL: 5/5 (pick a location and wire it up, prior experience helpful)<br />PRICE: 5/5<br /><br />My personal experience: I've been working on vehicles (cars/trucks/cycles/non-land-based stuff/experimental/etc) for 20+ years. I have a background with electronics, physics, mechanical and electrical engineering, and other stuff. This isn't to praise myself, but to help others understand my perspective in my review.<br /><br />My usage for this product: 30 year old 4 cylinder FI motor<br /><br />To address concerns I saw in other reviews, here are my direct observations:<br /><br />* I did not notice any significant delay in the tachometer response - it responded nearly instantly along with the OEM tachometer.<br />* All sensors functioned as expected.<br />* The gauge of the wiring (~20ga) is more than ample for the product. It's low voltage / low amperage. Any larger would be a waste.<br />* The shift light appears to be your typical/generic simple assembly. It's functional, and didn't fall apart on me. It's not a $200 shift light.<br />* The sensors came with everything you'd expect them to come with. Any special or unique adapters are application-specific, which is normal.<br /><br />WIRING:<br /><br />First off, let me provide the wiring for you just in case you need it (nota substitute for the instructions, just for reference):<br /><br />RED - 12v Positive Switchable, such as your ignition switch. This powers the unit up when you turn the key to ACC/ON<br />BLACK - Vehicle ground<br />GREEN - Tachometer wire, this goes to the negative post on your ignition coil or the tach-out terminal on your electronic ignition<br />ORANGE - Oil pressure sensor<br />BLUE - Water temperature sensor<br />WHITE - Oil temperature sensor<br />YELLOW - (+12v) This runs the gauge's backlighting, connect this to your car so the backlight comes on with your headlights/night-lights<br /><br />Note: It's absolutely CRITICAL that each of the sensors has an absolutely perfect connection to vehicle ground, otherwise the sensor will report shoddy information or won't work at all. Just because you screw a sensor into a piece of metal, doesn't mean it's properly grounded--you need to use a meter to check proper ground between the sensor's body and the battery. Example: If you use an &#34;oil filter sandwich adapter&#34; for example, it WILL NOT provide a ground pass-through because the metal is anodized, you have to run a ground to the sensor body, or scrape the anodize from the adapter and check for ground.<br /><br />MY USAGE:<br /><br />I used 18ga wiring to feed the gauge and the sensors. My water temp sensor went right into the hot-side of the thermostat housing, along side the OEM one. The oil temperature gauge went into a sandwich adapter with verified body ground. The oil pressure gauge was mounted to the firewall just above the rear of the motor, I ran a 1/8&#34; compression tube from it to the oil pressure port on the motor. Once my sensors were installed I verified that their bodies had excellent ground to the battery ground. On the back of the gauge is a selector switch to tell the gauge how many cylinders you're running, 4/6/8, so I set it to 4. If this isn't set properly, your tach output will be incorrect. With everything installed I checked the backlight, and I was able to verify that it is also dimmable (whether or not it is designed that way, it dims). I then fired up the motor and let it get to warm operation, while monitoring the sensors.<br /><br />RPM read properly, and the oil pressure reading was fantastic--it was actually more accurate than the OEM gauge and a Bosch mechanical gauge. Water and oil temps both steadily rose, and my 180* thermostat opened right as the temperature read 180 on the gauge. I put it through a few cycles and each time it was fine. I independently verified the physical readings of the sensors, and they were almost precisely perfect, within tolerance.<br /><br />THE SELLER:<br /><br />Despite my experience, I still make goofs. One of them was accidentally over-tightening one of the sensors, breaking it. The sensor quality was fine, I simply have gorilla muscles and sometimes over-do things. I contacted the seller same-day, and same-day he was able to respond to my call for help and ship out a replacement at no cost to me. I expected to at least pay for the part, but he insisted. He included a helpful note reminding me of the proper torque setting as well. Outstanding service.
B005O0N9QI|5|I got these because my mother and I are short and we simply got tired of seatbelt cutting against our throats in the car - Besides being uncomfortable,  that can't be safe right? These fixed the problem - hopefully without compromising safety.
B00AK9YYEO|5|I love this bag!  Easy to attach and take off.  Holds my gear securely all day long.  Very happy with this and the LinQ system.
B008QDK0RQ|5|damned good battery! arrived when it was -25 F outside, my car had been sitting for 3 weeks.. i put it in and in seconds I was back up and running, I didn't charge it at all, from shipping box to car.  car starts much faster now.. granted I only needed half the CCA (this one 700+ all I needed was 450.. lol)
B001NZZ9IE|5|Very pleased nice kit.
B00E1SN6HG|5|Breaks were as described and work and fit perfectly.
B005ZWM0R4|5|Plugged this sucker it to check a check engine light on a 2007 Maxima, plugged it into a laptop and found the range on my WiFi is pretty good.  Code it pulled was accurate.
B005JP16TA|5|Since I purchased this, I have preserved a total of 55 gallons so far.  Some I have used after 5 months and I felt no loss of performance or anything.  It seems to do what it is advertised as doing which is...preserving gasoline.  If there are any preppers out there looking to preserve some gas, this is it.  No worries at all that this will safely preserve your gas for a year.  I fill my gas cans, put PRI in it, and when fuel drops in price, I use my stored gas and refill my tanks so as to always have a somewhat fresh supply on hand.
B00176O5CK|5|Matched my C15 CAT perfectly.  Very good adhesion.  Very good  one coat coverage.  I bought one can as a testor. Now I plan on buying a few more.
B009ROGSG0|2|Did not like at all. Did not fit on visor and box obscured view. When pulling out tissues box would fall out of holder.
B00XZ70SFC|5|Fit perfectly. Quick shipment. A+

B003G9HVN6|5|Worked perfectly, no issues with installation either.
B001U7DUYA|2|The accelerator pedal did not fit my Wranger.  Returned
B0068ERZ14|1|Wow did they get me, nothing like I expect. This is very thin, almost no padding at all. I will pass. I put 900 miles on this pad just to give it a fair chance. The bottom stretched out and began bunching up making it uncomfortable. I had to take it off before finishing the ride and throw away.
B00KV8U20O|5|I can see so much better with these.

B00CP6J7G0|5|Dealership only sales the interior handles by panel, they quoted me $348 each front door panel total $696 and $370 for each back door panel total $740. Installations on each panel quote was $120X4=$480. I was looking at $1916 plus tax too get my interior door handles repaired. $147.99 for the set of 4 and if you watch the video on U tube to replace them saved me $1768.01 plus tax. This set is also a lifetime warranty and the plastic is 200% way better then the cheap factory ones. Parts-Pro on Amazon Marketplace is they way to go and thanks for the awesome product.
B00684TAYY|4|Works great. Please read the directions very carefully to avoid locking yourself out and foul language.
B0054KSFI0|4|Received order faster than expected.  Was easy to figure out how to install even with no directions.  Took 10 minutes.  Air noise from slots underside get's louder the faster you go....HD tape will fix it (I hear but haven't got there yet).  Great crossbars that don't break the bank!
B005GFVSDW|5|Great product billed right up
B00008RW9V|5|It's worth buying if you only pay 8 bucks... I recommend this mini duster
B00JA3BMDW|5|Infrared thermometers are designed to quickly measure temperature from a distance. Whether in the kitchen for checking the temperatures of various foods, looking for hot or cold spots within your home to figure out where you might need to better insulate, or even to check on the temperature of the CPU in your computer, a good infrared thermometer can provide for a wide range of valuable data collection.<br /><br />The Nubee Infrared Thermometer offers a great feature-set for a surprisingly low price. You get the thermometer, the required DC 9V battery, which goes in the handle, and a concise, yet thorough instruction sheet, which I also found quite educational.<br /><br />There are four buttons on the Nubee Infrared Thermometer. One button turns the red targeting laser on or off, another button switches between celsius and fahrenheit readings on the LCD display, the other is the trigger for single or continuous measuring, and the last is for setting the emissivity, which is a measure of the efficiency in which a surface emits thermal energy and which should be individually set for each material type you’re measuring (e.g., I set the emissivity to 0.96 per the instruction manual to properly measure the ice’s temperature in my freezer).<br /><br />There’s little else to say about this device. It does exactly what it says for an extremely competitive price. I think it would be a fun and valuable addition to just about anyone’s toolkit.<br /><br />Thanks to Volmate Technologies for the review unit.
B001GH5P3S|5|If you don't have this, you need to get it. It will probably be the most practical thing you buy for your Jeep.
B004WLRP74|5|Very heavy duty. I wish the little pick shanks were black as well or the big ones silver. Not a big deal.
B000VKTUD2|5|Super! So easy to install (watched videos on youtube), & at such a great price: Exceptional value! Thanks, ever so!
B00EAOI93W|5|[[VIDEOID:fbc7ff68936be9e4073f93c69e8736b9]]This oil filter is probably better than the OEM one from Toyota and a lot cheaper.  Some FRAM stuff is junk, but this filter is a great value.    I've had the oil tested and this filter appears to be performing the same, if not better than the OEM Toyota filter.  If you use the Amazon subscription service you might want to get an extra filter.  They missed shipping new filters to me twice because they were out of stock.    It says the filter has \\"Proven Protection up to 15,000 Miles\\" but I change it at factory recommended intervals.

B000C2UVW8|1|This particular brand valve is horrible. I've already been through three different ones (the company sent me replacements after the original leaked where the top hat is joined to the body. Both replacement units did the same thing - leaked from the top seam in the body halves. Replacing this valve can be a pain if it was crimped on originally. I finally bit the bullet and grabbed the AC Delco one and all has been well. Stay away from the 4-Seasons one.
B005HITI9Y|4|Fit good and looks good
B00OSVGZHY|5|The bars are awesome. It looks as if they were originally from Toyota. They were easy to install
B0060ZB4L8|5|purchase for our 2009 Goldwing and they fit and look great! Can't wait to try them at night on the highway...
B008CFCMS8|5|My bumper was damaged and I needed a new one as soon as possible. I went to a pick and pull and they were quoting me $150 for a new bumper so I browsed Amazon and found this one. I was quite skeptical of ordering a major car body part like this online, but as soon as I saw the package, I knew I had no reason to be. The bumper came packaged perfectly! There were not scratches or marks at all. More so, the bumper fit on my car perfectly! I have been driving with it for about a month now and everything seems to be perfect. Thank you!
B00I6MTQ6I|4|Install bolt would be helpful to provide as well.
B012B5WF2C|1|This is an over price product.  For the price you would think that you would get a quality product.  I bought this product  because I needed to patch a section of loose sound proofing in my generator bay.  I will try and re-glue the old (23 y/o) product back in place before I use this product.  Very thin aluminum foil on one side and the other side is a very thin piece of plastic.  The center piece looks like gray packing foam.  I have to say this is not the sellers fault but the manufacturers, as I am sure the price is also.  Our Amazon seller is just stuck in the middle here. Greg
B00QGULAAW|5|what a difference in breaking on my 97 talon . very nice
B00BKACQWY|5|Perfect fit on my 2005 2500 Dodge Ram Quad Cab with remote control entry.

B001EA0LJK|5|Great product and it's easy to work with. I  just  wish they had dark grey and silver (not chrome) colors though.
B00PCI3MXW|5|What's there to say, it's a sticker. Funny and arrived before expected. Every tool box needs this!
B00JBID2H0|1|Does not come with a harness you have to gard wire them
B005D3GOFO|5|GREAT PRODUCT
B00CQ0UBCE|5|Seriously I can't explain how awesome this is! Solid well made product. To attach to 4 wheeler remove rack and place both on ground upside-down drill two holes for each mount. Re attach rack then install quad boss. It's important you pick mounting areas close to edges so you can put u bolts in from bottom. There are no instructions but it isn't hard at all. Don't panic!!! Great great great product so safe for kids to ride now and it gives my 4 wheeler a cool look. Seat pad is so comfy as per kids! Buy it!
B00ZRNFN5C|5|Cane sooner then it said it would and seems to be really good quality
B00030D1DA|5|Great product fast shipping
B000JFL7ZS|5|Works the way it should. I got it to do oil changes on a Volkswagen and it does what it needs to. If you need a 35/36 mm socket I would recommend this one.
B0012PL0A6|5|perfect just as described just don't forget to prime them before installation
B000COMX3Q|4|Good price
B000GZEKNW|5|Exactly what I needed, reasonable prices.  Thanks!
B0090B7M2O|5|100% advisable
B00B2LCE1E|5|My 2011 gmc terrain gave an engine code that I narrowed down to this part. The part was not too difficult to install (I took 30 minutes). The hardest part was removing the old part. The car definitely started running smoother once this part was installed. It saved me time and money for sure. Very pleased.
B00C7I4PL8|5|I bought these to use in and around our pop-up camper this summer.  I cannot overstate how useful they've been, in countless ways.  We've used them to hang accent lights around our canopy, dry towels, they've doubled as weights to keep our table clothing from blowing...they're fantastic.  They seem like they're going to be extremely durable and they've put up with quite a beating from us already.

B00NOCC70C|5|Bien
B0009NUG66|5|Excellent
B008ZU8RNO|4|Nice quality gloves, good fit, sizing seems accurate.  So far they are very durable, I have some other Tourmaster glove, that have a liner, they are not as well constructed.
B00GQJCL1A|5|Excellent radiator.  It looked so good sitting there, I didn't want to put it in the Jeep.  I wanted to hang it on the wall in my office.  Installation was good and seems to be performing very well.
B00IGCTEME|3|Looked a little beat up when I opened the box. The one I was replacing is in better physical condition, but this one does seem to work. I'll try to come back in a month or so to update this review.
B00192JGDU|5|Excellent and light. Easy Assembly
B001KZFEZA|5|Fuel gauge stopped working in car at 140k miles, decided to replace the whole pump assembly instead of just the sender. This looks like a redesigned sender on the pump so that's a good thing seeing that the gm oem one fail often
B000GKEYDS|4|Smells a little strong at first, but once it's in the car awhile I really like it.
B000B8LKPA|5|perfect replacement.  Fast delivery Stant quality.  Best of the best.
B003L60FTQ|1|Zipper already broke!  Jacket is useless after only a few months!

B0028MN46U|5|Exact OE replacement upstream O2 sensor for my 2006 Mazda 3. I held the two sensors (original and new) side by side and they have the exact same markings and exact same design features.
B004TRKBOK|1|The product arrived with a broken blade. If it can't survive shipping don't let your life depend on it.
B003SWNVL2|5|We didn't end up needing it for the trip we took. but it looks great, and we'll probably use it before the end of the summer.
B00MC7H3LS|4|Replaced older LED replacement bulbs with these.  Much brighter and nicer looking as well.  Great product,  They are pricier than others however, which is why I gave only four stars.  I removed the resistors at time of install and replaced the flasher relay with a LED relay from DiodeDynamics.  This combination made more sense.
B004B8C2IU|5|Great quality.... Thank you very much for the Thank you note.
B000CPCC4U|4|Great dill
B003UT3S6Q|5|Great wheel cleaner, but a bottle goes quickly.  It has been more effective than P21S wheel gel, but the P21S does last longer at the expense of more scrubbing necessary. If you have wheels with intricate spokes (e.g. BBS LM, E39 M5, etc) this a must have.
B002E1AYTU|1|Junk!!! This item was junk. It was used less than a week and broke. The wheels broke off. I would have returned it except my husband had already thrown out the box. We will never buy this brand again.
B000O824Y8|5|Takes use and abuse
B0076I4UXM|5|Perfect fit on my 98 camaro, price on point
B00F542DQU|5|Fast shipping on a very bright light.
B00HVVVEYM|5|This cargo carrier fit perfectly and is very well made. I've used it several times already. Even in pouring down rain with strong winds, all of my camping equipment remained dry. I'm very happy with this product.

B00ANXSWQS|5|I removed the Browns dealer sticker and made a mess. Fortunately, this little fix made it look more sporty. All I need now is some custom fender, wide rims, lowering springs and turbo.
B00465ZXTI|4|i love it awsome
B004AQR53K|5|Recently spent 6 weeks in New England and Canada.  Unit kicked out once (as it is supposed to) when we encountered an open ground condition.  Excellent product and cheap insurance for the expensive appliances and electronics in the fifth wheel.
B000C59KWW|4|worked well on my 1971 F250 ford PU 4x4
B008G3COBQ|5|They work well
B00FTDJ9FA|1|Originally I had reviewed these as great, but one of them started flickering after a few months.  I contacted the seller and he told me that I would have to pay to send it back and then they would send me a new one.  NOW, in my opinion, why should I have to pay to ship a defective product that I have already paid for? I provided pictures and details.  It's not like I use my reverse lights a lot, so I expected them to last more than a few months.  And I also expected to not have to pay to ship back a product that should have lasted longer than it did and that I have already paid for(and over paid apparently compared to other sellers selling the same bulbs).  1 star.
B00EIBQ2DG|4|Awesome knob! I used to have an aluminum knob and it would always get too hot to the point where it would sometimes burn my hand so it's nice that if this knob is in the direct sunlight it stays cool (: plus it's Spider-Man 😋
B00I2Y01LO|3|It doesn't even click into my seat-belt on my truck smh no good wth....... Never again!!
B00MMSTIN8|4|Not the best brake lines I have installed by far. They are a little shorter than they should be and the installation was harder than it should have been due to design flaws. The braking improvement was amazing though, but that just has to do with switching to SS lines.
B00AH6MLPO|1|Where do I start. From the product images this seemed like the best fit for my bike. Assembly was an ongoing possess with many hidden screws when I finally got them to stop moving on there own the worst part happened. Most of the parts turn a bronze color in the sun light I guess. I would say that after 2 months of use half the time under a bike cover the mirrors have become an eye sore. Most of the parts are bronze not the same shade some lighter than others. Some parts have not faded at all the best example I can give is the left mirror frame and back side is still black with the left side a mixed color bronze gold tie dye looking color. Theses mirrors do not take the bronze like In the Olympics, they only tun bronze and only 3 months ago they arrived black. Unless that's a hidden feature I'm happy.  Update I have added some pictures. Bronze and the left is a different color more chrome. Also it really tells you about an Amazon seller when they repost the same item for $1.00 more and get some fake review about buying cheap stuff from china. Instead of reaching out and offering help on a product sold &#34;cheap china stuff&#34; was re-offered for a dollar more buyer beware of Astra Depot sold by 99_online. On second though maybe that's why the name 99_online once the seller gets bad reviews they just raise the price 99 on line.
B00K0VMXDQ|3|My husband was impressed and happy to get this as a Father's Day gift. We haven't had to use it but the size and and functionality of it again is impressive and promising.
B00480J4J6|5|This bulb fits my Toyota Prius 2008 car perfectly fine.  My dealership would charge me $150 for the same bulb which is 3 times more than amazon price. I had local mechanic installed it for me for under $10 so my total cost to replace the faulty headlight was $60 instead of stealership price of $250.<br /><br />Side note - My headlight was not totally bad before but it would turn on when I start driving and by the time I come back, it was turned off by itself. I believe this is a general behavior of HID bulb going bad. Don't freak out if that happens to you. Just change the HID bulb and you're good to go for several years.<br /><br />I have it installed on May 2014 and today is Aug 25th 2015 and its still running wonderfully.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful to few of you who is deciding whether or not to buy this bulb for their prius.  Thanks!
B002J7O95Y|5|Very handy. I even use it to wash my walls down. I have the zwipes microfiber rags so I can just pop them on when the pad is being washed. I really love reusable instead of disposable
B008Z8W5XY|4|I like it.
B000UKJ786|2|Box described contents as &#34;vent hose&#34;<br />It did say Motion Pro<br />I bought and paid for fuel line! Too much of a pain in the button to return product and wait several days
B000CFQ38G|5|good
B00KL3ALGO|1|This item truly offers no protection from the sun.  I placed these on my back windows to block the sun from my daughters face and you can't even tell that there is anything there.  No difference as having a small amount of tint on the windows.
B001D5FZCO|2|Part listed in Amazon for 2013 Altima L2.5 4 cylinder.  Bought a combo of engine air filter and cabin air filter.  While the cabin air filter fits, the Wix 49057 does not fit engine air filter box.  Amazon offered refund quickly after contact.
B00JMD4B4C|5|The fact that I don't need any bulky piece mounted to my helmet is wonderful since everything is built in. I'm loving having tunes in my ears where I ride alone.  Amazing comfortable helmet
B002M9XMNY|3|Good design but like others said the bolts are not good quality.  I twisted the heads off two of them.  They will rattle loose with in a few mile trip also.  You must go and purchase grade 8 bolts at the least and HAVE TO put washers and lock washers on to keep them in place.  Otherwise a solid unit that just needs a tiny bit more refining.  I am using this with a 14' enclosed trailer being pulled by a 2010 5.7 tundra.  Good product just have to buy better hardware.
B0090WM0RK|5|Great harness, I originally purchased the 3&#34;, but felt they were too big so I went to the 2&#34; and love them.  Great quality for the price.
B004HYNGHY|5|Fits perfect. easy installation.
B00QLIFC4E|5|Got quickly, very fast shipping.  Said to place when weather was cooler than the 90 degrees we has here. Went on easily, looks great!  Will buy more.
B000TCTD3Y|2|I generally like Odyssey batteries. I use them in my motorcycles, and thought I'd try one for my car, since I already had two Odyssey chargers on hand. My complaint, like in some other Amazon reviews, are the side terminal posts quality. I came out of a store and my car woudn't start. I called a friend to come give me a jump, and it still wouldn't start. i figured it must be something other than the battery, so I had it towed into a shop.<br /><br />They found that the battery was still good, but that one of the Odyssey leads to the side post terminals was broken. If you have top post battery connections you may get full life out of this battery. But if you have side terminal wires, you may want to consider another battery. I'm sorry I didn't head the warnings in the reviews I read prior to purchasing.
B000VKTUE6|5|Fast & easy replacement in our 2002 Honda CRV!
B000Z0HVHA|5|Nice thick gauge and solid enough fittings.  Has held up so far and has been very handy to have.
B00JZCMFJ8|5|No one has seen one like it in this area.  I am a Rat fanatic.  More proof that Mickey RULES!
B0006IX7ZG|4|Price is good
B0000AY2Z6|5|Update: 5/11/2016  I just purchased another Endless Breeze fan for my roof top tent on my jeep.  These are amazing little fans.  I also use them on my boat. Super quiet and move a ton of air.<br /><br />Update: 9/18/2015  These work so well that I purchased two more.  These move a lot of air even at low and are so much quieter than than anything else I have tried.  I'm using these in my off grid /off road camper.  I plug them into an ARK Pak and they run for a week.<br /><br />This really is the best of the best for 12v box fans. It's quiet and moves good air.  I purchased a second one for the other end of my camper.  Even though it's not cheap, you get what you pay for.
B00027GT06|5|As advertised
B000CFS0QY|5|Needed these with small head to install Headman Headers on a Jeep 360 engine. Was missing 2 from the originals that came with the slightly used headers. Worked well and so far so good! Amazon prime to the rescue again! Could only find these locally in 3/8, not 5/16 as these are. Cons: I was only missing two, but I will use these in future installs I'm sure!
B010H0QV7S|4|First up I have to say that there appears to be two of these models out there.  One, the older ones has a set of tools built in and runs on button batteries.  The other updated one which I received has no tools on it, rather a seat belt cutter, and, it (thankfully) runs on two AAs.  Just had to make sure that is understood before I go any further...<br /><br />This is overall one of the best things one can keep in their glove compartment.  Its not only a very accurate tire gauge, but has a couple of extras on it including a window breaker that could save ones life...As for its operation of each, the tire gauge works like a charm.  It instantly reads and holds the pressure reading so you can see it easily. (It has a nice dark contrast on it).  Also, a back light comes on when it is applied and stays on for over 15 seconds, where at that time it reverts back to its zero reading.  (It also immediately reads the next tires pressure without having to wait till it goes back to zero.  Just move from tire to tire, press it, and the new reading moves with you.) As for its 4 ranges of measuring stats, (PSI, BAR, etc), sometimes I found I had to cycle through the others to get it back to the PSI reading when first turning it on, which is a pain, but when measuring your tire pressure, more than enough time is given in between for you to check all your tires before the light goes out and it has to be reset.  I measured the length of the back light being lit several times, and each time it was close to 20 seconds in duration, twice what another reviewer here claimed on theirs.  That is easily more than enough time to get around to each tire on your vehicle without it turning off and having to reset it.  Also, this is the only tire gauge I have ever used that effortlessly takes a reading without it bleeding, belching out a little air if its not securely fitted on the valve stem.  This one is so quiet and never spits out any air that at first I didn't even realize it had take a reading.  But it does take one immediately when it is pressed, and as mentioned before, there is a handy back light on it that stays on a very generous amount of time in between tires.  I have no problem or complaints at all as to the operation of this when taking tire readings.<br /><br />As for the seat belt cutter and glass breaker, I didn't test either, but I have no doubt both would work with ease.  Both the cutter on it and glass breaker are very well constructed.  Very tough and solid. (The glass breaker can also double as a valve bleeder very easily).  There is a flashlight built into it that is not super bright, but well enough to see your way, work on your car, or find something should you need it. (It also has a red light on it that I have yet to figure out why its there). This whole instrument has an overall quality feel to it that for the price makes it the best digital tire gauge I have tested in some time.  About the only thing I can say I don't like about it is its not arriving with the two AAA batteries required.  I really hate when they do that, but it is what it is.  Overall this is a nicely designed, quality built gauge that has some excellent features, and I consider it one of the best of its kind for the price you pay...Highly recommended.<br /><br />Free unit supplied in exchange for an honest review...ding.

B001O0U1P4|5|I love thermo quiets, nice quality pads I have installed many and never had any comeback for squealing like some other factory pads do.
B003ZJ2IQM|5|These are grate bought a set for the other car
B000GD5FMY|1|Too small
B00BK8QRXA|5|It fits just right and it looks great, I'm happy with it.
B00LCND3B2|5|Thank You
B0046IC24O|5|Works as described.
B00QFSJKQG|5|no complaints
B00TXVNZQI|3|The craftsmanship is not so good.
B008N3JA2U|5|All good
B004NBMDMA|4|Works well. East install. Just felt a bit cheap.
B006GFU3VO|5|All good
B000C5WCPY|5|Just what I needed & lowest price available. Thanks for good products & service.
B005FI51EM|5|This is very good. Meets my expectations. Exceptional buy
B00N77SCJY|4|Good product
B00C7OKV2Y|5|This is may third set. They fit the bumper just right, you have cut a little bit off length.
B00R6PZDMM|5|Beautiful!!!
B0067ED1S6|5|great product
B00PGJDZ7U|5|Really enhances my 4.6L 2007 Ford Explorer!!
B00G3MLUP8|5|perfect!
B005DC5YYC|5|These were pretty easy to install, once I figured out that there were 4 places to unscrew the old light that requires pulling back the trunk interior. There are no instructions, but it's not all that complicated, just difficult to get my hands into the tiny places to unscrew the old light cover. This is just the plastic piece that the lights and wiring go into, so if your light bulbs are burned out, get new ones, too. Have gotten compliments on these and they make my car look extra sexy.
B006K8GKBO|4|Plastic is adequate for occasional use, but I would rather have the combs made of metal for durability.  Are there metal combs like this for professionals?
B00EKUK9KW|5|As advertised.  Worked great to fix the broken latches on my cooler.  Also makes it look like the expensive Yeti cooler that it is not.
B00BFDFC54|2|Rubber attachment (too vehicle) is way too short.....
B002OPPSGU|5|Awesome product
B007WZS41I|5|All is great so far after a summer of trips.
B000VT0JOW|3|The original is ok, but I returned them to get the in-channel visors.  These were outside regular and did not meet my expectations.  If the in-channel did not work, these would be fine, but not as slim looking as the in-channel.
B0031ZDU62|5|I have had these installed for a couple of months now, I have had no problems so far  and not a difficult job if you take your time...
B000BYB7H0|5|Quick delivery, fair price, Genuine Motorcraft part well packaged.  My 2000  F150 Lariat 4x4, runs strong and sucks a lot of fuel, and still looks great.
B000NJQXJK|5|My husband loves them. Very well made motorcycle boots at a very reasonable price. Quick shipping and fit true to size. Would definitely recommend.
B000KJ1L18|5|Great price. Fast shipping!
B002OUIXU8|5|Working out very well with What I need itv for not chincy but wrap it in winter time if you live in your RV or use it as a second Guest room..
B00FZGAZXQ|5|it was exactly the same as a OEM part. perfect in every way.
B004MXLA28|5|Worked great on my 98 grizzly. Nice thick heavy duty material.
B006NYHTL0|1|Never again. The first DEA mount that I received was assembled backwards sent it back and received a different one. Installed on car and after 7 or so months started hearing a real bad noise every time accelerated down the road. I was on the verge to of a possible timing chain change. Thanking that It couldn't be the mount, I just changed it. So I decided to look at it with a mirror and to my surprise it was resting on metal to metal. That's it!!! went to the dealer and purchased a OEM mount. Now I cant believe how smooth the car runs!!!! I cant hardly hear the engine running at Idle while sitting in side and defiantly cant feel it running. NEVER AGAIN will I go cheep on my car parts.
B000C10EVC|5|Good product and good gasket that will last you one year or 10000 miles if that is your oil change period
B00IEE7Q2Y|5|Great quality.  Too long to close tailgate under 4 wheeler in ford f250 but that is my fault for not measuring.  Just wish they were a little shorter buy a great ramp.  Very solid
B00FJDL0J8|4|I used this to try and restore a faded black bumper cover. Initial application took awhile due to the diamond pattern in the plastic but made the bumper cover look great. Since the application took so much time, I was hoping the product would work for a long time. The unfortunate fact is that after only two months, and minimal contact with the elements, the bumper cover was looking terrible again. I reapplied the product, but since I had already treated the bumper once, it went on faster the second time.<br /><br />Based on how much I have been using, one bottle will probably last me 2-3 years. A little really does go a long way.
B007GR4LIC|2|the sun destroyed it in less than a year. no harsh winter in ca. this year.huge tear all the way across the rear,not on a seam and not touching any part on the vehicle.the tear was between the rollbar and the back bumper.the fit was not tight ,so there was no stress.easy on and off. the materal also showed a lot of deterieration.
B000GG1IHC|5|perfect!!!
B00DOHT0V6|5|switch worked great and delivered on time
B00M9K3HYU|5|These magnets completely explain me - and any possibility of my kids *ever* driving. They are large enough to read and stick VERY well onto the back/sides of my SUV. They were tested by my husband on the highway, and DIDN'T FALL OFF! I admit, they have NOT been tested with the teen driving, as I am still a bit too nervous for her to do that, at least for now since she does not yet have her permit. I think this is just an amazing little investment in my sanity. At least, when it comes to the time I finally let my teen behind the wheel, I will know the others in our neighborhood will know it is her, and stay way off the road! lol. Note: I received this product at a discount for an honest review.
B008DUUEG4|5|Part was as expected
B00KL3ALGO|5|These really do cling quite well! Very handy
B003SS62PS|5|I'm happy with it.
B000Q71N8K|5|My business is home made candies (caramels, toffees, brittles) and this little guy is great when at a show and the outside temperature is up there.  I keep my caramel products in this and it keeps them at a comfortable 70 degrees, perfect for selling at outside shows.
B00NWF7CLA|5|Excellent thus far
B0001EWQX4|1|I ordered these because the description says they attach to the exterior of the door with tape.  The set I received do not do such. They have tape for them to be installed inside the window channel.  This is not what I was looking for.
B00U65S2OA|5|For several years I've taken apart various cars the hard way. I've left scratches, dents, and broken several pieces. Thanks to this set of tools those days are gone and my interior has been put completely back together looking like new.<br /><br />The various tools are very helpful for different parts of the trim and the case helps keep everything together in a nice neat package. I can't recommend these enough! If you even use them once they will pay for themselves.
B00ARUQ4JE|5|Great Item!
B003YNHEBS|5|fit exactly for sienna 2007 bank 1 sensor 1.
B000VKRQBA|5|Fits just like oem.
B002DQGV6Q|5|Works great, came with a case, and shipped super fast!
B00I82BWB8|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B003K2GCES|5|Awesome bang for the buck. At half the price of other street performance pads, this is a huge value for someone who wants a quiet pad with more bite than the stock PBR pads.  There are more aggressive pads out there, but not for this price or with these street manners.  Make sure you look up stoptech's bed-in procedure prior to driving normally to get them broken in correctly.
B0021Z710E|5|Thank you everything was just fine
B00E8416HU|2|Only positive is really bright. Description says fit on drz400 2000+. Well my 2001 is way different than the installation instructions shows. If you are not a mechanic and doesn't like to mess with electronic then don't bother this item. It's not easy to install!!
B001JB53KQ|2|piece of SH--
B00LHKRV72|1|It came quicker than I expected.  Went in pretty straight forward.  Does not flash at all.  I know the signal is still getting through because the brake lights still work.  But, they do not flash at all.  It's not worth trying to return it.  I will just have to get a different product that will actually work.
B00HQYTUYA|5|SUPER SOFT!!!!!
B002WB615I|5|I always use Wagner, best brand, no noise at all.
B0076I29WG|5|great stuff worked fine
B0042Z307E|5|I use this on my patio overlooking the pool! It's durable, beautiful and keeps our feet cool!!
B000E28CK4|3|Unlike the kn 157  IT FITS.
B00A3NJ6QS|5|I love this!
B00NH92LOO|1|They had the nerve to have stick on Acura symbols I would not recommend them to NOBODY!!!
B00SG9QUJW|5|Love them!!!!<br /><br />I'm in California and my renewal tag is in the top right corner. The frame does not cover the tag. See pictures.
B00DTBU6IS|5|I love this driver back rest! The product  went onto my 2014 Street Glide easily. It makes riding long distances much more comfortable.
B002UC4QFQ|1|never returned anything purchased yet, but this thing is the exception, put it together after reading and following the instructions, used the correct pressure on hose, lite the thing and it turned into an instant fire ball. Not so good in a new or under construction off grid cabin, without all the modern amenities.  Reread the instructions again, did everything correctly, re did everything, double checked all fittings and same thing. Fire ball. Having had enough excitement for one day, I threw it all back in the box.
B002X6VXL4|5|works like a champ a great investment as I own four cars and my girlfriend owns one..
B0023VKOU0|5|fit just fine
B009H46ZWC|5|Far better quality than other similar items.  Only a few $ more, faster delivery, branded product,  and USA sourced
B00BDVKLFO|2|The item didn't work for my car.<br />Even though 1K0-927-808A was written on the packaging, the actual item itself had a different part number written.<br /><br />These sensors are very signal sensitive. My car (2012 Volkswagen CC Lux) threw the &#34;incorrect signal&#34; error once installed and didn't work.<br />I guess I'd just head over to VW and get an OEM.
B00MTK21VU|5|excellent product fast delivery,really satisfied...
B005RJ3GBE|4|I gave it 4 stars because it was a little small but at least I won't lose my key
B002QGVW3K|5|Exactly what was needed for a Coleman rechargeable inflator.  Very happy to find a replacement battery.
B00UN1Z2TA|5|👍 fit and finish is good quality rubber
B002YKK234|5|worked and fit good
B000CN77PG|5|Nice. Outside bushings should have grease fittings too like others said but you can't have everything. Nice improvement in handling
B00I9FPRBK|2|Smaller than I thought it would be
B00AV8HSA6|5|Easy to assemble even though the instructions are a bit off. I had to check YouTube to use it.
B004MEES6M|4|it works as intended.
B00UZA635G|5|Programmed in under 20 seconds.  Works like original.
B00W1C3OAS|2|Bought this maybe 2 months ago and the one I use on my drivers side is already broken. Going to buy a sturdier one that can handle at least 100lbs of tension with regular use.
B008XLPP9E|1|The instructions say how to test if your wheels are clear coated or not, but the instructions don't make sense.  I am quite sure my wheels are alloy, but now I am afraid to try sanding them down, due to the unclear instructions.  Why, for instance would rubbing compound turn black if my wheels were not clear coated?  They are perfectly clean?  Confused...
B00OW0NQGE|4|Exactly what I was looking for, fashionable key fob. Easy to add and remove keys to they ring, and it is strong enough so you don't have to worry about your keys falling off.
B004AQZUX2|5|Product is as described.
B003Z6912E|5|Perfect fit, size and worth the investment.
B009902YK6|5|I waxed my F150 and my wife's SUV with this pad and it still looks new.  Held up very well.  Really pleased with it.
B00JREPRJE|4|everything that I  have ordered came on timehttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511Bja-tPiL._SS300_.jpg....Thank you..
B0009GYRWW|5|Great stuff
B00SH1SN6C|2|First it works.  It charges and starts a car and produces light.  The light takes for ever to turn on, you have to hold the button for 5 seconds.  It charges via a round charging port instead of something useful like a Micro USB.  It come in a case which completely counters the compact nature of the device.  The case is not water proof and generally not super sturdy.  It would be nice if someone with a brain designed these things.  They could have made the clams much smaller I mean a stud for a battery is a pretty standard size.  I hope their next model has an easier to use light, a smaller more useful clamp, A smaller more useful case and charges via USB C.
B00BD4SKY0|5|There great!
B00F67PDM2|3|Decent quality.
B000RDJNOY|5|So far, so good!
B000HBM8HU|5|THIS PRODUCT I USE ALL THE TIME
B00UIVYWKK|3|A few of the bolts did not fit way they were supposed to fit. But overall it was still a good deal for what I paid and got to use out of the kit. Most of the led's are not pretty bright.
B00QZHP2GY|5|The gel pad is great and works just as i hoped.
B00BVPTUBS|1|This does not fit my 2000 accord as it claims, had to return it.
B005SNMS36|2|returned, it was super super small compared to what I thought it would be.
B00075XCCG|5|Installation was actually as easy as advertised!  Installed on 2008 Pilot in less than an hour.
B00G7KPPUM|5|I recently put these on my 2015 Forty Eight Harley Davidson Sportster. I could not be happier with the sound and performance, not to mention they also look great, what a huge difference from the stock pipes.
B0043DSGX8|5|great sevice
B00449J46E|5|Easy to install. Saved lots of money👍🏼
B00NWT3RWE|5|great sevice
B00GRRFLOK|5|Sturdy, well-made, easy to assemble, works great, good price, makes loading bike much simpler
B000EVU8J8|5|Top of the line,<br />High quality
B00CJ08M2W|5|WORKS WONDERFUL
B0049Z2WXK|1|It is not water pump
B0096ZRCPQ|4|I bought these for both my husband and I.  His fit perfectly, but I had to trim the length on mine.  We bought size medium.  Mine though on the first ride already has a hole.  I knew the leathers wouldn't be thick, but still upset that they already have a hole.  I don't even remember bumping anything.  But for the price, we love these chaps.  For the ladies, they will not only block the wind, and possibly protect you in a crash, they also have a sexiness about them ;)  And it's the same for the guys.  I loved the way they looked on both of us.  And they are very comfortable.  This is more because they are thin and didn't need to be broken in.
B002XM5G70|5|nice and quiet, good pressure.
B002N2OKMM|5|Great product
B000BZL08A|5|Wasn't able to reach connection so i just cut and reattached
B00CI0K5VO|5|right part but bought for extra so havnt put them on yet so cant tell you how the wear is on them seems to be a good heavy product though
B009DJKHXO|5|pump works good just what i need to to pass my vehicle emissions, great product, fast shipping
B003CWJ7R0|5|I have a 2016 Nissan GT-R and would say it fits perfect! I think the listing only goes up till 2013 so I had to call Amazon to place the order and confirmed with Coverking it will fit so from 2009-2016 is the fitment for this car cover. Going back to this car cover. It fits so perfect it even its made enough to wrap just a bit under the front and rear bumpers and low enough to pretty much cover the entire including the tires leaving about an 1-2 inches from the ground!
B004ZF4ETY|5|Hi to low change does not worked. Halogens bulbs do it, but not this. Really I do not know why, but light change works with my original halogen bulbs, but not with this kit.  Update.- Sept 17th, 2015.  Today I had received a new harness and bulbs replacement and worked as expected. It did the Light change.  Kensun customer service has been trying to contact me in several times by mail, until they got to contact me, and I did explain to customer service the Xenon kit behavior in order to solve the issue.   Great customer service, this is why and how a company get trusty.  Thanks.  I will buy again when need it. I am a happy customer now.
B009YMI9EY|5|The product is fantastic. Far exceeded my expectations. It is the perfect height for me and deflects the wind great. Very stylish and easy to install. Highly recommend this product.
B007EQO48W|5|Purchased these to replace the originals on my 2010 Jeep Wrangler Islander simply because some of the elasticity in the originals is gone due to the effects of the elements after 5 years. They are exactly like the ones currently in use that came with the vehicle when it was new. Length, thickness, cam lock, footprint, etc. are identical. Installation of these will be a weekend project  down the road.  I highly recommend them as they are the original designed hood latches that hold up and present no risk to the paint finish because they are MOPAR OEM  and provide the power to maintain a securely closed hood at highway speeds!!!!!.
B006LI7FHQ|5|Great price and a great Product i'm glad I bought it.
B00CMCRYNK|5|They went on like a glove. Thanks a lot
B007CA40EI|1|not in color like it shows in the pictures
B00HNHWW54|3|Had to do a little bit cutting lights dont angle perfect on the bumper. Maybe for older models . But I was able to modify it on my truck. And wires need to be a little longer.
B011VRBH48|5|Shipped, installed, and performed as advertised.  I prefer the plastic knob over the metal, since the metal will rust and seize.
B008L63ZKW|2|Came off in a drive thru car wash
B002UC2SRE|4|Works good and it's a nice looking light too.
B000QGUSVY|5|Fantastic! OEM part, includes the orifice tube. Perfectly fit my 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix. Can easily be bent into shape to fit in the tight spaces inside the engine compartment without risking a kinked tube. This runs from the condenser to the firewall, and includes the schrader valve for the high side service port. Additionally, there is a port and schrader valve for the pressure switch (not included) that can be easily screwed on. For my particular application (the aforementioned '02 Grand Prix) it is difficult to install without separating the two halves of this product, and later tightening the orifice tube fitting after each half has been installed in the car.
B00O4MT40C|4|Good for the price. Actually pink and not purple ! I'd buy them again.
B005LLZT4U|5|This seal worked great with no oil leaks. Will definitely use this product agin when needed. Thank you.
B00F4MUYN2|4|My husband normally wears a XL but we decided to go with the 2x and it fit perfectly. It's roomy enough to wear over a long sleeve shirt but not baggy. For the money it's a decent deal.
B001TFE38A|5|Easy on, easy off. I'm happy with it. I've typically been a huge fan of Poorboys stuff but my bottle of EX-P disappeared so I thought I'd give this stuff a shot. Hope it lasts
B00A3D3588|5|Worked perfectly and super easy to install.
B000C2WFA4|5|Very smooth three click your ready to go
B000Z0HVHA|5|bought this to provide extension for my RoadPro portable fan.  this gives me the opportunity to bring the fan to the x-pen for my dogs when we do lure coursing.  great price and fast shipping
B0002Z9QO4|5|We drive from NJ to FL every August, and have purchased a cargo bag for each trip bc they've all ripped, until this one!  That was our main concerm bc having to continuously check on the cargo bag is a pain. This is allow some moisture in, however, we always cover our luggage with heavy duty garbage bags. Awesome.
B0018ICAMO|5|I have had them on my topper for about a year now no problems at all good value fast shipping
B004A61MAC|5|Best spin on oil filter ever made. Not much more I can really say, but filtration at its best. Watch their mfg video on youtube.
B00KTJ5M2I|2|Works great and easy to transition from old remote BUT letters on the remote faded off in just a few months.
B000BUQODG|5|Great vent cover, works exactly as it should. And installation was easy. I highly recommend these. And the filtered back is great, keeps all the trash and bugs out without restricting the air flow.
B0031P6AIW|5|Very helpful
B001C97V4Q|5|Perfect fit for my car.
B00U6JUBHM|5|It's hard to order the right parts sometimes but this was perfect, Thank You.
B00J6ZI5FM|5|As advertised!<br />Sturdy and high quality.<br />Simple to install and fit perfectly.<br />Very pleased.
B000CE9O06|5|Installed on my girlfriends 2013 F150 with 5.0.  Deep grumble.  Sounds much better than stock.  If you want loud then this is not for you.
B004J8P22A|5|I've never had a problem with anything Reese makes.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great product. Third one I've bought.
B007KPWYN4|2|Ok, so... I mounted it on an 07 FLTR...the product IS well constructed... the product works well.  What they neglect to tell you is that this product WILL damage your fender.  There is no way around it.  I have factory forks, factory everything, and just leaving a driveway slowly, I still managed to hit the fender with the bracket that mounts under the triple tree.  The bracket tucks the damper as high as it can, but this design just compromises the space needed for basic fork travel.  Maybe a bump stop or something would help?  Or maybe a design that routes it another way instead of under the fairing? I have made peace with the dent in my fender as it still has plenty of clearance underneath before it hits the tire... so, I will ball peen the dent to a more round shape that looks better aesthetically I think, then get it repainted.
B00XK4K5LM|5|This is a great kit because it is complete, it comes with all the needles, jets, etc that are replaceable in the carb, unlike some of the junky kits that just have a gasket and a needle.
B00FX9U69I|5|Excellent product and promptly delivered.
B00B8TWJR4|4|Fits my super winch.  It is neoprene.
B001DKTG0G|5|This oil is the best transmission oil I have ever used, I had a slight grind going into 2nd in my GTI, I changed the redline for royal purple and thw grind went away in less than a mile of driving. Absolutely amazing. I now put this in both my Audi S4's, as soon as you shift you can feel the difference, it makes shifts super fluid and smooth.
B00OTXCDPY|5|Very bright lights! I put these on my Toyota Highlander as DRLs. I wired them to stay on all the time. Yes, I did use an inline fuse.<br />I replaced 2 crappy eBay LED lights on this vehicle with these. Be sure to turn them down some as they will blind oncoming drivers at night.<br />The quality is excellent. Made of finned aluminum. Be sure to install mout, then attach light to mount. If not, you will be taking the mount off to install. (speaking from experience)<br />1 picture included, taken in afternoon, but believe me, they are BRIGHT!
B004I0H86C|5|Fit really well for my 2003 camey
B001B7TT3K|5|no issues
B004I11UM4|5|Great! Legit part, much more affordable than the dealership's price, super fast shipping. Not for a novice installer however, as is with most toyota parts this is not easy to install.
B00AIFZ2Q4|4|i used this to extend connection to trolling motor. soldered and it will probably be ok. would not have ordered if i had read &#34;copper coated aluminum'.
B004GZSHSC|5|easy to install and my truck is a monster now.
B008GGH9IQ|5|this are great makes car stand out at night BLUEEE
B00AX72ZR6|5|very good,just like the picture and they fit
B00L2NF1XA|3|A little small for a sequoia and color is a little off from what I see in the picture. But they work.
B003ZNRGXI|4|These are nice lights- the projectors are brighter than OEM. The halos are not very bright for daytime use. I hooked them up to the head lights so they are visible at night. Overall a nice addition over stock.
B002YC8BOE|5|Perfect for mi chevrolet 3.1 lumina 98
B0016LE80K|5|High quality and works great, I would buy this again.
B001KO2EB8|5|Can it fits on sportster 883 2003 model
B00MP1HI2K|4|It's a nicely made frame. They did some engineering design of attaching the fasteners. Not tough to figure out, just different. Very important, check your clearance from the top of the frame to any plate lamp or body part. The scope of the rifle sits outside the frame on top and will collide or prevent the install since it needs at least 3/4 of an inch clearance. The frame can be mounted without the scope and just the rifle for a standard fit that won't exceed the plane of the license plate.  This WILL NOT fit a Wrangler Jeep standard plate.  I intended to mount it on my '15 Wrangler Rubicon, but it's design wouldn't allow it, so i just ended up mounting it on the Lad Rover.
B00BG4LE4U|5|Gauge went  out of calibration. had to go back to the mechanical gauge.
B004I6APUM|5|Well made product, fits perfectly
B00LG70N44|5|I contacted Thetford to confirm this was the correct replacement for a Thetford Cassette Model:C - 402C RH.  Thetford confirmed this as the correct part. It is an exact fit OEM part.
B00C7KP1GO|5|I don't know what people in the other reviews are talking about. I just received mine, and it looks exactly like I expected it to, so don't believe any of the nonsense that they say. Fits perfectly, looks good, and I'm happy with it
B000765DI6|4|Rusts very easy. Paint peeling.
B000CB3X4W|1|Do not waste your money! Went strait to garbage.
B0014E3MSS|5|Received sooner than expected and item works great.
B006ZVMT7A|5|GREAT
B009S9RU8O|5|Goes on easy and gets a lot of laughs. Great sticker!
B00QUSEFWA|2|Wrong part, it did not fit. I made the mistake and cut part of the hoses before I push it through and realize the seal was too big for the tank hole.
B00KTJ7U3M|4|Great cost effective replacement for the original key fobs.  I have a 2001 Corvette.  Trained the fobs in seconds.  Only complaint is the buttons are crazy sensitive.  You could easily bump it in your pocket and set off the alarm.
B010N7RW2S|5|This product should be in every car emergency kit! The PowerCore Jump Starter had no problem jumping the battery in my Chevy Malibu. The process of jumping my car with this was very straight forward and easy to do. Anker has documents how to use the product very well. The PowerCore Jump starter has a small screen that displays the battery percentage and it is activated by pressing the button beside it. If you press and hold the button it activates the flashlight which is a great feature to have in an emergency situation. Once the light is on tap the button again and it will flash an SOS signal and once again to change it to an alternating light pattern.<br /><br />The PowerCore also works great as a phone charger and is a great feature I never really thought about until now. If I ever have car trouble or get stranded I now don't have to worry about my phone dying while waiting for help to arrive. It really just gives me a great peace of mind that I am prepared for the worst in the event of car trouble.
B0007VU48K|5|Fit my 2012 Sea Doo RXP-X 260 perfectly, including a perfect insertion into the OEM battery case. Terminals are on the correct sides and line up with the cables properly. Absolutely no special tools or adaptation is needed to use this battery in said application. I just gave it a solid trickle charge before throwing it in the PWC. The red thing in the picture is just a cap for the positive terminal and also holds the two gold washers you can see in the pic as well - it comes right off and reveals a terminal identical to the negative one. Battery is made by Deka and is also a fit for the 2013, 2014, and 2015 Sea Doo RXP-Xs.<br /><br />Update 3/2017: Still going strong and approaching 2 years. If I'm not using it for more than 2 weeks I take it out and put it on a float, and during the winters I bring it indoors and keep it on a float (basic owner routines I employ on all the batteries for my PWCs, ATVs, and motorcycles).<br /><br />Addl Info: I also have a new 2016 Sea Doo RXP-X 300 and they went back to a standard size Yuasa battery (see link) for the new ACE 1.6L engine so this size/type battery is no longer applicable for this model.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WK2DB2?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage
B00K9S18VS|3|They were okay. I would not recommend them for anything that is parked outside. My car is garaged, the elements would ruin them quickly. They are  thin plastic not very sturdy.
B001BFPYGI|5|Perfect replacement for my 2005 Suburban
B001QULYYO|5|I have been using these for years and they perform exceptionally well. I ordered these for one of my sons who just purchased a boat that he will be towing. Can't beat them for what they are intended to do.
B000F27D9E|5|Shipped fast, great price, just as described. Thanks
B004NFXA7I|5|It's been 3 months, and water still rolls of my windshield like water off a ducks back. Fantastic performance during the Florida summer storms.
B009OBVXC0|4|Does leave swirl marks if not careful and then you spend a ton getting it professionally done. I recommend a little at a time and take your time with it and don't be in a rush to finish it fast.
B00BFDG17M|5|Excellent
B008SFAMX4|4|Worked good..just drew in humidity under cover some.
B00EHA5C8O|5|Product is just the right size for using under our Sunsetter awning. It is low to the ground and very light to move.  I do not ever anticipate using the strap but it is a nice idea.
B0058P8K7M|5|Thanks
B00NMP57MG|5|exelent
B008BX8GPY|2|Good item but it don't last long after 2 months the bulbs goes out had it replaced but its the same problem gonna try something else wouldn't recommend this product
B00ARJQ0MG|5|Worked great for the car. Alot less then what the part store was asking.
B00PKOP3LM|2|Keeps breaking
B00C88ALWE|5|Item worked great for replacement switch
B0041CAECM|1|I purchased a used 2012 with this exhaust.Noticed pipe broke around 3 weeks of ownership.Wrote to SS.And because i'm not original owner i eat the piss poor QUALITY PART.Don't waste your money on these POS pipes.<br />Check harley forum for the photo's.Pipes are very thin.<br />http://www.hdforums.com/forum/screamin-eagle-cvo-models/1067174-ss-header-pipes-nfg.html
B0045DM5I8|5|Got everything as advertised and its all oem for cheaper than aftermarket. Couldn't go wrong
B001SL9LL4|1|Within one day the butterfly stickers on this steering wheel cover started to peel off. Very poor quality, I don't recommend it.
B007B856YY|3|Light on the switch is backwards, when i turn switch off the light turns on
B000N35LZS|3|Pretty light duty. Will not withstand daily use. I use this occasionally to remove and clean plugs on a 2 stroke outboard. I doubt it will withstand any heavy torque.
B00JK6LFF4|5|Fits perfect for my 2015 Honda CRV. Keeps the pine needles and pine sap off the car when we are camping, so happy for that!
B00R3O0Y0M|3|I had the higher pitched red ones, and they were decently loud. Now I have these (lower pitched) - and with the relay, hooked up correctly. Checked with multimeter. Grounded properly. Checked and re-checked... They don't seem much throatier than my stock horn. I was expecting perhaps a bit of blood from the ears of the lady in front of me putting on make-up at the green light.. but.. nothing..
B00EQ4H3HE|5|Don't no to soon to tell
B00FTAYXC2|4|FIT PERFECT IN MY CAR
B004AAKJFW|5|Works great.  I have 2 now. No problems
B00318UXY6|1|Died after about 3 months of daily use, 8 hours per day.
B00XNWHLUE|5|Item is sturdy, colours are vibrant. Not bad for the price!
B00HWKL5GY|5|Bought for my fiancés truck, perfect size!
B000R3R6K2|5|Item works great.  They are a pretty cool addition to my car.
B008P51ETS|5|Perfect Fit
B00J00X3NW|5|A+++++
B003VLBPJA|4|Very nice tie down
B00PX6CK2C|5|I got these in the mail today (2 days early!). I Installed them for additional light on my Honda ST1100. I just got in from a night ride and I've got to tell you, these suckers are BRIGHT for such a small light. I will definitely purchase another set or two for the Jeep. I commute 108 miles a day. I leave in the morning at 4:00am; I'll be excited to get up and see how these babies do on the highway!
B004LX3AS6|4|Firstly, I returned this item not because this system is bad but it is a trickle charger and at 750mA, takes too long to fully charge automotive batteries. It works well for its purpose which is to keep batteries topped up over long periods of disuse but I was looking for something that would charge my car battery overnight. With this system it took around 2 days to fully charge a car battery that was at 40%.<br />Also, it does not have a fan built-in and is soundless when charging which is a plus for me. It never got more than a bit warm during the several days I had it plugged in. I was impressed by the build quality, safety features and 'intelligence' that I sent this in for a larger capacity one (G3500) from the same manufacturer. Would recommend for a trickle charger and for charging small batteries.
B007V2CCZ6|5|fits like a glove!!!
B011P30EC4|5|Scanner works great.  I was worried about connection issues that were a problem with the older models, but this one connected right up, and updated the firmware.  I've used it twice, no connection problems.  Also, when i downloaded the app, it gave me the live data, powertrain enhanced data, and CodeConnect for 1 vehicle all for free. I was worried I would have to fork out extra cash for these options like you did on previous models. I highly recommend this product!
B00OA66IG0|4|4 stars for Foam canon and 1 star for the soap.  Made my clear coat had weird discoloration spots when drying and my van is a 2014 always kept in the garage.  I had to rewash my van with Meguiar's Ultimate Wash and Wax then wax and buff it to get the spot off the clear coat.  I want my 2 hours of my life back from waxing my van Chemical Guys!  Worse car wash soap ever!!
B00DU6R7Q6|3|Feels cheap but I guess you get what pay for
B000AMLWH8|5|After I bought one...  had to order 4 more to finish my Jeep Cherokee's interior! Works good!
B001PYQMUC|5|Direct replacement and fit on my 93 nissan D21 truck..
B002M4B3Z8|1|Only gave it one star cause you can't give none. The lenses were poor fit and the wiring burnt out after 3 months. Go to the junk yard about the same price and they won't almost start your car on fire.
B005EV281O|5|Very please thank you
B007PLZGO2|5|I in joy the looks I get when people get close enough to read it. ..I love it thanks
B00BTMQMSC|3|Pretty decent product. Had one bulb out of four that had some LED's out but installed it anyway.
B00VYB3JO8|5|Nice item fits perfect
B000CMH2XY|5|Just what I wanted.
B000CF8W1W|4|Purchased this for my 2015 Tacoma and it fit pretty well. The front was a good fit but the back was okay. The back could have been made a little longer but died the job. The quality was good but I received it with few minor scratches even though it was wrapped in plastic.
B0097SVS6Q|5|Great fit good protection.
B002XLHUQG|5|Get these chicks if stability is a concern for your RV, made in the USA and excellent quality.
B001P27Q72|5|Graet seat covers to bad I cant find them any more, would like to get some for my truck now.
B011QV9XWW|5|Great mirror with great price. I'd like to recommend it to anyone who want a cheap and high-quality mirror. It is easy to install, I spent merely fifteen minutes to handle it.
B00B29V12E|4|Slid right in place. Fit good. Need to be a bit thicker. Definitely a good investment
B00142V63S|4|These fender flares look great on my truck and are made with quality in mind. They were easy to prepare for installation, and were easy to install the rear flares. The front flares, however, are difficult to install, largely due to the short truss screws that go into U-clips (7/16&#34; might be better than 5/16&#34;). Otherwise it would be five-stars.
B00IMPEWHM|5|Worked great!
B0078U8EEE|5|Quality Rear Inner Seal. Exact fit for my 2002 F250.
B00164QX14|2|Returned the thermometer to repair the discoloration. Waited 4 months for the repair to be completed. The discoloration returned within 2 months. The thermometer works though.
B0065FRBZ6|1|Very low quality.  Broke the first time buckles were pulled tight.
B008L5J5G6|5|Works great . Easy to install .
B00GS7XS9O|5|Awesome product!! Definitely makes my 2014 Jeep Sahara Wrangler stand out among other Jeeps!!
B001V3959W|1|Fakes, do not buy. Why do you need fake $16 dollar glasses
B00L5QRLLE|5|This actually arrived earlier than I thought. I love it. Great product.
B00O98OPT6|3|it does look good, specially if you're decorating your car with these kind of skulls, however it doesn't  smell as strong as any other refresher, neither last as long as any other, I believe DRIVEN it's a cool brand but not very good with smells, they usually don't last as long, but still cool looking stuff, also I live in FAIRBANKS ALASKA and even though it says 1USD for shipping it ended up costing me a total of  8USD to get it here for the simple reason that they don't sell it here any more; anyways if you are planning on buying this product I recommend you to get it for the looks, not the smell!
B00CBTRMZ4|5|Super.  Already installed
B009DJVGDE|5|fit very good very happy  will by agen
B000WNTYBG|5|These 82lbs springs were the answer to the clutch slipping on a 2012 Royal Star Venture
B00877SL2M|5|Put these in the dash and the marker lights of an 87 Chevy van. Sweet. Like driving a new vehicle wow what a difference in how they light up the dash. Doesn't look old and dreary anymore. Very pleased. Quick ship good price good quality
B0007RDVH0|2|Not very good.
B000FIY08U|1|Didn't open it for several months after getting it. It smoked out as soon as I plugged it in for the first time  on the day of our trip. Cost me a lot more to buy one with the Coleman name on it at Cabellas.
B00366UBMC|5|I installed this in my 6th Gen LX. It contained everything--and I mean everything--in high-quality parts to replace all components for a complete timing belt change. It's a big, all-day job (for me, at least) but doing it myself saved me $500+ in labor costs. The 'net is ripe with tutorials, though and with this all-in-one kit you can get the job done.
B007THZMWI|5|works as described, needs heavier test leads, I recommend the alligator clip reels, been wanting those for some time now.  You can use this to find shorts in automobile electrical, or in HVAC finding a shorted compressor, or whatever your trade.  Because of the high impedence of the tester, it is like a small meggometer.  Not quite as accurate but close.
B00AYJK02K|1|have not been able to get it programmed
B0036YW91K|5|The valve cover received was not the one depicted in the ad. The one I received is shaped like the stock valve cover. It is chrome of fair to low quality, sides of valve cover are rough and not as shinny as the top. If you desire the valve cover that looks like the one in the ad, your guess is a good as mine if you will get this one or the other one. After several exchanges the company rectified the issue in a more than acceptable manner. Making me alter my review. The 5 stars are for the company. I can not testify to the look and quality of the valve cover in the photo, just to the one I received. Thanks for standing up and truly earning 5 stars.
B00CFQTO9A|5|Works like brand new. Price was right.
B0012RJZT2|5|easy to install
B00KG58YR0|1|Terrible quality. It's an expensive, thin towel that has an ever expanding slot at the top with very cheap elastic that does nothing to keep it on the seat. Huge waste of money. I ended up getting a $6 bath towel from costco to cover my leather seat in the summer. a 50 cent binder clip holds the edges together better than the sewn in elastic ever did. The elastic would just keep stretching and the towel slides down further. The thin material slid out of the seat every time I got out and I would end up throwing it back in so I could close the door. The thicker bath towel I bought doesn't slide off as easily and most of the time I don't have to think about it. Save yourself time, money and headache and use a regular towel with a clip.
B008BYRGCC|5|works great.
B00EAWLVL6|5|Great sticker!
B00K35XHT8|5|Excellent quality.  Runs perfectly for my OLD car!
B000BQW5LK|5|Work great!
B00ST9S3F8|5|Very affordable top box fitted it to my V Strom 2014 pretty easily. Holds alot of stuff & is steady on the bike.
B008E9110W|5|these little suckers are bright
B007QC1TIM|5|Awesome, took less than 2 minutes to replace. Don't pay dealer prices of $45 to replace this unit.
B0007UA1NE|5|Worked as describe would get it again if I needed it.
B0070Y36NC|5|Great light love the effect it gives easy to install.
B00CFALFXY|5|The cloths worked great as expected. I bought these to replace my old microfiber cloths that started leaving lint on the windshield.
B00CZ4VFOE|5|Noise cancellation. I use this on my motorcycle and everyone I speak to while riding says, my voice is clear and they do not hear the wind. A+ performance. The device last for hours and easy to setup.
B00XULVDHK|5|These worked well on the side window.
B005DS9WFI|1|Bought this kit to delete the egr system on my 2005 duramax and absolutely nothing fit. Not even close to fitting. Tried contacting seller and manufacture with no response. Hopefully I'm not stuck with new paper weights.
B000AM8BLI|5|Great bulb I just replaced this after a blown out bulb in my van now lets see how long it lasts
B00MFCQWVW|4|Cheap product. Not DOT approved. Eye catching.
B00W4QC00Q|5|Nice looking wrench. Good feel to it. Good ratcheting action.<br /><br />I can't speak as professional mechanic, but as a shade tree mechanic and all around handyman, this wrench meets my needs.
B00MV75ZLY|5|Excellent and matches almost perfectly.
B00S7QNUVA|5|The item arrived promptly and it fit my Honda generator.  No complaints and would work with this vendor again in the future.
B00KLSZ632|5|They look bada$$. I only wish the amber was a little brighter, but that's also a function of my stock corner housings.
B00ODXB8JM|3|Disappointed it was made from cardboard. Bought one for a different car, was stamped metal. Still looks good in the garage.
B00BUS3AKS|5|Subaru Dealership wanted twice the price,i shopped around and Amazon became my HERO !!!!!!!
B0009IQXJ0|5|Shine like no other
B00G1Y3DJ4|4|Love these leavers. My only complaint is the clutch lever is a little wobbly but nothing I can't live with. Great product!
B00KJ1K64K|5|Worth the extra money to avoid cutting up the blanks or going without.
B00FHOESV6|5|I really like this. It makes my car look fancy. Great price!
B001CPTRGU|5|It is great fit was great
B000C1LLPA|5|The best ceramic pads I has tried.
B0016GUMIC|5|Very cute. Durable. For easier installation, let it sit in the sun for a few minutes to warm up before slipping onto the wheel.
B00JVMSLQI|5|Awesome product, over a year using it and still works as expected.
B00KFPNPMK|5|Love them!
B0088BBQC4|5|Perfect fit
B005JZD6KM|1|Does not work with a 2009 F150.
B00KTIYXLU|3|This Product looks how it should it only works if your inside of the vehicle the signal sucks. As for me i only needed the shell i put in chip from my old in the new one and it works.
B001FY1AN6|2|This didn't fit my car like it said it was supposed to.
B00873J0YY|4|Great value for the money! Work great for carrying my kayaks!
B00BLKXW9O|5|Just what I needed to service my Suzuki. Recommended by the manufacturer!  Blessings, John 20:29
B000GTXD4K|5|Awesome! Thanks!
B0046ID5EK|5|Got it quick and programing it was easy.
B002LS08U6|5|I've been wearing these same gloves now for a few years of warm weather use (I use other gloves for cooler temperatures). They are still going strong and I absolutely love them. When I get them worn out, I will buy them again.
B003VAUK4W|4|Used it to lower a motorcycle carrier attached to the front mount hitch of my F250. Lowering 10 inches was just the ticket.<br />Worked as planned.
B00W5X3BN8|5|Loved it.
B00KTIF652|5|These replacements worked well on my Bravada !!
B0002KRC5O|5|Works well
B00FW35MXK|5|Good product, what can I say, it's a sticker
B001O0C93G|5|Perfect fit
B000CA5VPM|5|good
B0082365AQ|4|worked well !! makes real easy to take down to lake
B00J594EGI|5|GREAT GREASE AND OIL REMOVER.  I USE IT FOR CLEANING THE UNDERSIDE OF MY CESSNA 210 AIRCRAFT.
B00XJFK3IM|2|Came in with no instructions.  Took me a while to get them work since then connectors were labeled and switched opposite from power and ground.  Let me  tell you.  Their red wire to the main plug is not power.  It is the ground side on the vehicle plug.<br /><br />Anywho.  Once I got them to work.  They light up nice.  Now let's see how long do theyast for.
B00266Z8LW|1|Not bright at all, got refund but lights are crap.
B00PYQC75G|3|Well, the back seat covers does not fit at all but I use the front seat covers.  Hooking then was a bit if a pain too.
B00UVXDIS2|5|I'm a Minion freak love them so I minionized my car , thanks for asking
B001G18M3Y|4|Perfect replacement and works well.
B000M5Y72A|5|Received as promised.  Just what I was looking for and a great price!
B0036GK6N6|4|great fit and initial quality
B00480841K|1|The mirrors are a great concept but the suction screw down is cheaply made.  I bought Drivers and Passengers.  The passengers stripped out on the first attempt to install and I was able to return it.  So I attempted to be more cautious with the Drivers mirror and it stripped out on our 2nd trip and was too late to return it.  Until the suction mechanism is beefed up I would not recommend these mirrors.
B0027XK788|1|Looks like just what I needed. Just like the old one but in one peace! The lid could be a little stronger material it's almost transparent I'll probably just paint it, but I wish it had some more strength to it. I'll update after I put it in. Waiting on seal tape<br />Update. 6 months in, don't open it much. But went to open it when camping last weekend and the handle fell apart. See photo. Not so good after all.
B00UCUUJUO|5|works great and brightens up the night all signs glow
B00230D6KQ|5|Great fit, works great!
B00FQ8V2P8|5|Exceeded my expectations, the only thing I didn't like is going to the car dealership and pay $120 to flash it. Other than that the product works extremely well.
B011W1AWTY|2|Nissan Pathfinder SL 2015 - fit is not perfect.  I went by the Amazon filter that said it would fit my car, but it is not a perfect fit.  There is a slight bunching up on the middle 2nd row mat (hoping time and gravity will flatten it).  The 3rd row fits nicely.  The problem with the first row is the outer edge toward the door doesn't seem to fit properly (sits a little off grooves). Getting the mats to hook onto the floor hook was a bit of a challenge and did not secure on as I would consider firm. Functional wise &#62; it looks like it will get the job done, but I would have like something that fit better.
B0009V1WS4|5|Works perfect.  Locks easy and slips right in.
B00WMR1I64|4|very good product easy to install.....
B004H6HDA8|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B00J65IQSS|5|Did a great job of cleaning out the gunk and rust in our Ford pickup. This older vehicle had recently been to the garage and we were promised a cooling system flush had been done. BUT a quick check of the overflow bottle showed a lot of rust and dirty orange water still in the system. With Zerex Super Flush -- purchased because of some good reviews, the price, and that we could get free 2-day shipping with Prime -- I was able to do a real flush of the system. The easy instructions are on the bottle -- just follow them. Here's a good vid from You Tube, altho' with a different brand of flush: just use Zerex. https://youtu.be/RWIXa50R9bo<br /><br />Worked well for me. Recommended!
B00651CBO6|3|Looks cool, but anything over 35mph will make it bend. After driving 3 hours over the mountains the antenna has a permanent bend to it. Would like it to have been a little sturdier. Going to buy a shorter one that is more rigid.
B005ETHNFC|5|OEM fluid. Put it in the car, car shifts smoother again. All is well with the world!
B00407RTBW|5|worked well when combined with primer and clear coat. no problems blending and no problems with the spray can nozzles.
B005NLQAHS|5|Got the scan tool to reset a check engine light on my 2008 Acadia SLT (purge solenoid warning), worked like a charm, also tried it on my 2011 Audi A4, and 2013 VW Gol, all three worked flawlessly, I used the android Turbo App, perfect pairing!
B00F9LPKJ6|5|So far so good.  I installed it in my Softail when replacing an AGM battery that was starting to decline.  Easy installation with the included foam blocks.  Very light and powerful battery.  It cranks my 80 inch engine faster than the AGM battery ever did.  Fully charged it with my Harley smart trickle charger before use as per instructions.  Have not had it on the trickle charger since I installed it because I do not have anything that would draw it down on my bike, and they do not sulfate or self-discharge.  I'm hoping to get more than the three years out of it that I would get with the AGM batteries.  The softail battery installs in the middle of the horseshoe oil tank, and combined with the vibration, is a harsh environment.  We'll see how this Lithium Iron battery is doing several years from now.  This Deltran lithium iron battery is by far the lowest priced battery of its kind on the market, and it didn't cost me any more than the AGM batteries I had been using.
B002Q137QU|5|love it. Its on my bike and looks like an expensive paint job.
B007AOS8K8|4|These are nice mats, the fit was not 100% perfect but it was very close. Getting them used from Amazon was a good deal. 40% off and it looked like the had been opened but showed no signs of use, perfect condition.
B00UL1UJ86|1|Does this fit a Nissan Altima 2013 Sv ?
B00432S99U|5|THIS LIGHT IS BRIGHT AS HELL .........EXCELLENT AT NIGHT
B000BUTD9S|5|Nice product.  It even works well on steps with slight curves (I was a bit worried about the when I ordered them).
B0066QR924|5|They worked great just like the OEM
B00Y9VDRUQ|5|Great product. It came in the mail 6 days before the earliest expected date. I had to make custom brackets to mount on the roof of my bronco, and had to beef up the wiring to handle my battery voltage, but this thing is incredibly bright when it's all said in done. Great light for off-roading or driving at night in the woods
B007TZB7YM|5|Good quality sticker. Awesome cause it's true.
B00317499M|5|All good
B006WPQMWM|5|Absolutely the best porta potti we have ever purchased! We've had 3 over the past several years to use while camping. The is by far our best purchase yet.
B00K6B4XSS|5|Great product and performed as expected
B0083H4SMI|5|Worked great,easy to install.
B000BQSIWK|5|I really like this battery charger. Very impressive. Does the job. Happy I brought it.
B00LC82GZQ|5|works as it should
B0043063JU|5|these are perfect, for my lower walk-out porch area., sturdy., will last.,
B0009IR0PQ|5|Like it
B00KTHV10C|1|I have a Honda Accord V6 2006,<br />The key is not served, after much work I managed to duplicate it,<br />but the car does not recognize the new key.<br /><br />In the instrument panel turns on the light of the key,<br />and does not start the car.
B00QXE3Y0A|5|this part fit very good very happy with it will by agen
B0024E6V9E|3|Better than what I expected.  It holds the filter upright and out of the dirt/and Mud.
B00H8V321S|3|OK, if you like testing the prongs to see what is what since this switch does not come with a schematic or instructions of any type. Probably you will find that the original switches in your vehicle will be arranged differently, so be sure to take notes or pictures of the wiring of the switch and be prepared to have to experiment a little to get the wiring right.
B0029XHOK0|5|Looks great!
B000CMD896|5|Needed to replace 30 year old mirrors on my International because the silvered glass on both were shot.  I liked the black finish on these as opposed to the stainless or chrome look.
B002XM5G70|5|Quiet, Powerful, all you could ask for in an RV water pump.  Usually I can't hear it running, but always there. A really good product.
B00CXZQE1Y|3|Broke at the screw attachment area after about a week
B00WIZVHFW|5|Product is perfect, with a great price.
B000QUXWHC|5|When it comes to my car I must have OEM or at least something that comes close to OEM! Luckily this cap is an official Ford part that took the engine light off my 07 Shelby!
B000WK4B5I|5|Love these things. Easy on-off, add another round Velcro tab to back of helmet to hold them out of the way when you don't need to wear goggles. Have had multiple sets over the past 10-15 years. Elastic gives up after ten years or so, usually longer than the foam in the goggles or helmet can make it. Great product.
B00CU4TSJS|5|More than exceeded my expectations  - at a great price
B00LFL8LOA|5|Great
B00EZE79HE|5|xcelent
B007AE1X8C|5|We also ordered these for our 2005 Alfa Motorhome.  They took some time to install but they look and work incredibly.  Hint - Connect all white and red wires together to a new single wire.  Same for all of the black wires.  Connect these two wires to the unused socket you'll have left over (parking light).  Be sure to check polarity before the final connection with a meter.  My white/red (pos) went to the dark wire on the socket and the black to the light side.  That made it a LOT easier to connect since you only have two wires instead of 6 on each side.
B004VGAJOG|5|perfect
B009SDAYQK|3|Great for a stash horn on a bobber or looking for a sleak design without a cowbell on the sidw of your engine
B000ARTZOK|4|fast shipping, item was as described
B007ZDGMA2|1|I am sure of these results. This cleaner wasn't very good at all. I felt water and a wash cloth could have done what this cleaner did. Not impressive and it took a great deal of elbow grease.  I used it on a $450 Dooney and Bourke handbag, in fact it doesn't look as though I did anything at all. Maybe I am the only one but I bought 2 sets of this cleaner and conditioner. I am going to see if I can send the other set back. I don't recommend this product at all and for the price they should be ashamed of their advertising.
B00IMLGIKK|5|I have a 22' hewescraft aluminum boat. The deck is grey so i was worried that it would soak up the red light. I was definatly wrong! The deck lights up perfectly! I want to add a photo but as soon as i figure that out i will do it!<br /><br />I have only recently installed them and havent went through a winter yet but I will be putting these through a brutal test. So I will review this again later on in the future.
B00PLPN6GE|5|I used this on a xs850 with a 3 into 1 header. Its been a low budget job and this is about as cheap a price as you can find! I was concerned about the sound, but this tip doesn't come up short.
B001UA96YU|5|Product in perfect conditions
B00LOS87G6|5|With all electrical parts there can be so hit and miss out there, the Regulator/Rectifier I received burnt up a diode as soon as I plugged it in. However I contacted the company through Amazon on a Sunday morning and they responded within the hour. Great company, Great product as far as I can tell.
B00SEH69SS|4|Was a perfect fit.But don't use the adhesive pads that come with this.  I used the pads, and on a clean backing.  At 60MPH the mirror started to lift off the backing.  Seems strange with the mirror housing.  I used locktite extreme (also from amazon) and that seems to be working.  Would have been 5 stars except for the adhesive pads (a strange size for the mirror anyway).  But a perfect fit and looks great.
B000GD5FMY|4|thank you so much
B009QWWRPY|4|I had a leaky grey water tank valve in my RV. With this valve, I was able to reuse the old valve housing and simply replace the internal valve. It was fairly easy to take apart and replace. Here are a couple of hints to help you with the install. First, they include 4 bolts. They are all the same length. However, you need two short bolts and two longer bolts to do the install. The 2 longer bolts are needed to go through the flange AND the housing. So save the two longer bolts from your valve that you are replacing. Second, lube the seals with silicone grease AKA plumbers silicone grease...NOT petroleum jelly. The silicone will hold the seal in place while you install the new valve and the seals will last longer. Third, my replacement valve did not come with any instructions. When I went online and found the instructions,  it does NOT show you how the seals (which direction) are to be seated. So put the flat side of the seal against the flange and the ribbed side should be facing the valve. I also had to use a little penetrating oil to get the set-screw out of the old valve (holds the cable in place). The new valve set-screw takes a different size allen wrench than the old one...at least vs. my old valve. Now the grey water tank valve slides open and closed with ease. I think just about anybody could do this.
B00XV4W686|4|Great bulbs - fitted nicely with bright amber color!
B000X03VZI|2|Does not fit my 55chevy steering column
B004B61B34|4|As advertised. Bolts up nice, easy to install. I purchased it so I could mount a bike rack to the back of the jeep. Not sure if it's the hitch or the tubing on the bike rack but it's not a tight fit, wobbles side to side. Had to add some washers and a different bolt. Meh!
B00LGL15OM|4|Only fits on one air conditioning vent that is hard to reach from the driver's side, but keeps my coffee from spilling.
B000BQR100|5|this was a gift but my friend says it works great
B000FW2MCM|4|works great!  it never gets to rest driving through these hills of east tennessee.  BE SURE TO FOLLOW INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!<br />they're quite simple to follow; just do what they tell you .
B00KTIUG5C|5|Very Happy. Programmed fast
B001FHSAEK|5|Great product. Thanks
B00BVPOC20|5|Easy to install. My daughter is 16-year-old and installed the part herself. She's rolling once again.
B00FEYG5AG|5|awesome
B00JQ3QBVE|5|I ordered this product twice, it is amazing how bright they are. I cannot believe that I have been buying stuff at the same price, when this ones are so bright, so good looking. I highly recommend this product! It is awesome!
B00ANG15F0|3|It filled it in a little bit, hopefully will keep from spiderwebbing.
B00MP40676|5|Necessary item for OSHA regulations.  You can clearly see pictogram.  I'm happy to have found them on Amazon.
B00OZHRS36|5|Powerful and  compact compressor.  Fills tired very quickly and efficiently.
B00D3T4PNI|5|Got 2 in parallel for &#34;house&#34; power.  Kept on a solar charger, they seem to be very happy.  Have actually jumped my vehicle with them (who knows if this hurt them a lot), but it got me running!  Can NOT recommend that for a regular thing, however, as these are NOT made for that.  Long-term drain, I have barely touched them.
B008C8WDR0|5|Worked like a charm!
B007KOC1MO|4|Worked as expected. Took off the scuff marks completely.  Scratches were more difficult.  Also this was not effortless. I spent 4+ hours. Still faint scratches but much better than replacing a $800 door wall.
B00VEW34LU|5|Great seller! Great squeegees! No problems...other than my lack of skill at window tinting. The main squeegee is great though, will use for window cleaning in the future.
B00S9FQN40|1|They were way too big and when I tried to return them I didn't even get my money back
B00ALL6LGU|4|Looks great and fits wonderful
B000143LHY|3|It works pretty well for STRANGE odors... but I think the scent is too strong, and it smells like some weird lemon lime drink. Lol.
B00SA8INAS|5|perfect
B00E1SG3M6|5|Love it!!
B000OCHDAE|5|Heavy Duty tool!! Worked great on my rear axle nut. 2002 f250 super duty srw
B000BKKUSQ|4|Not bad, but the fit was not as clean as I expected.
B004GCAUSA|5|Perfect replacement for 89 B2200.  All metal.
B00UAQ7F02|5|The sticker arrive before scheduled and looks great on my car!
B001KSAF2Y|5|SHIPPING TOOK FOREVER, DONT BUY FROM SELLER IF IN A HURRY, BUT GOOD QUALITY AND IT DID THE TRICK
B003U53JYG|5|Super quick, great waxed look after finished. Perfect for the drought in California.
B00JAL9Z74|5|Such an awesome product. Have purchased HID's from elsewhere before that were plug and play but would frequently not work when turn on. These from OPT7 are great. True plug and play. I installed the 10,000K H4 bulb on a 2014 CBR650F, and it works flawlessly. No need to connect not to the battery. Just had to use the adapter cable that came with the kit, plugged it into the existing harness connector and plugged the light into that. Very simple. I only wish I had realized that I didn't order the Bi-Xenon, as I was trying to get away from halogen altogether. But the low beam HID is bright enough on low beam that I just leave it on that. Awesome product overall. Quality of the bulb seems excellent, packaging was organized and not just thrown in he box. The directions, had I needed any, were very detailed and specific and showed great illustrations. I definitely think these are worth 5 stars and I'll be getting all my HID products from OPT7 from here on.
B000RDLAPY|5|This is a great catalytic converter. Perfect fit for my 1999 Honda Accord LX 4cyl.<br /><br />This did come with the metal ring gasket and one normal gasket. Did not come with nuts/bolts/washers.<br /><br />I was able to pound out the studs on my old catalytic converter and use those.<br /><br />Pros: Job is very easy to do you self with very little tools. I already forgot the exact size sockets I used but I think it was a 14mm.<br />  Perfect fit, was able to use the old heat shield as well. The old converter did have a hole for the bolts to go through on the heat shield but it fits snug and doesn't rattle.<br />  This did make my check engine light go off! I did have to reset it by holding down on the milage reset button continuously while turning the ignition with the key into acc2 then starting the car. All while holding the reset button. Continue to hold the reset button until the light turns off. My light has still not come back on.<br />  Price is great compared to other competitors and especially going to a shop and getting it done.<br /><br />Cons: I don't have any right now maybe that they didn't add two holes to the converter so the bolts for the heat shield would stick a little better on.<br /><br />In all it took me an hour and half to do this, that is with jacking the car up and everything. Also did an oil change while I was under there. I have noticed a slight change in performance, I think thats because mine was so old.<br /><br />In the second picture I took both gaskets out of the bags so i am not entirely sure that the gasket matches the part number on the bag. Sorry! Rookie mistake.
B00NGFP5S8|5|product all that was discibed,very easy to install would buy again very pleased with purchase thank you
B002UC4XHM|5|Work good
B00ZGGORFM|4|Have not tried yet, but for $15 you can't go wrong
B0002SA0AU|3|Extremely difficult to install in the windshield channel.  Since the plastic edge may straighten out with time, the second effort at installation may be easier.  The top works pretty well at slow speeds (under 30 mph), but at higher speeds the back tends to migrate up the roll-bar.
B008AFYN6O|2|Great Deal I purchase this product about three weeks ago and it works just like the original one.
B00XOXAGP4|2|You get what you pay for.  They fit.  That's about it.  One sensor had no readout and both were flimsy crimped onto the nut
B0091DJWV0|5|I bought this to diagnose a P0420 code in a 2005 Nissan Frontier and in the short time I've had it, it's proven to be a great little tool.  It enables you to graph real-time sensor output so I was able to see the pre and post cat o2 sensor readings and determine that was a bad cat and not a dirty sensor.  I've also hooked it up to a '13 Subaru XV and '07 Ford E-450 to check for pending codes and it worked flawlessly on all three vehicles.  For the initial update you need to create a profile and have the capability to read/write to a mini-SD card, however the actual update itself was fairly quick and easy.  Overall I'd say this is a great buy for the shade-tree mechanic looking for something more versatile than your basic code reader and the fact that it reads SRS and ABS systems as well makes it worth the extra couple of bucks in my opinion.
B000VAV3FA|5|Fit like they should
B00EHLMTKM|5|Its great!
B00A70CLZ0|5|Fit well
B00INZ65B2|5|This was an easily installed product once you had the instrument panel out.  There are YouTube videos for many vehicles on how the remove the instrument panel if you don't have a factory shop manual or AllDataDIY.com account for online access to a manual.  Although only one gauge was out on my Envoy, I replaced all six while I had it apart.  Plus two lamps which were out.  Easy to follow instructions.  You will find YouTube videos on the replacement process also.  I temporarily reinstalled my instrument panel before putting the clear cover on and took car for a drive to verify that I had correctly aligned the needles on all of the gauges.  Used an App on my iPhone to verify that the speedometer needle was in proper position to indicate correct speed.  Telling an officer &#34;I just changed my speedometer stepper motor&#34; probably wasn't going to fly if pulled over for speeding!  My kit was missing the solder so I used some Radio Shack small diameter solder which was of the correct silver/lead combination.  This kit is definitely worth getting to have the gauge needle removal tool.  No scratches on the instrument panel face plate.
B00GSAUHB8|5|works great
B00EKTJU26|5|Easy to install, excellent value and they LOOK GREAT!
B001CO6GWY|5|Great product
B00WFFNWIK|5|cant beat it for the price
B00GHT6SF4|5|Looks great and fit just right. It's like a brand new console.
B0092M1GXW|5|Nice stickers, just make sure you measure your centercap for your wheels, because they were too small for me. My mistake though. The quality was very nice.
B004LWVEKS|5|A great product! Super high quality
B0066CP6I2|4|This moves a lot of air.  I use it on the medium settings as it gets pretty loud on high. But it moves a ton of air on high so that is to be expected.
B00W6XM1VK|2|The pads re too small
B000O0V1P4|5|Great product
B000GD5FMY|4|The lens and frames are per the description. There are 3 vents top and 2 vents bottom, so they are good fair weather glasses. There is significant air flow around the eyes, so if you don't wear contacts, they are probably fine. There is so much air flow at speeds in excess of 60 mph that they bother my contacts, but for the price they get the job done. Shipped quickly, no scratches, and feel comfortable. I like having a pair for day and pair for night so they get the job done.
B000E267ZG|5|This worked out well once we figured out how to install it.  Used to transport 2 bicycles.  Nice that hardware is included.
B00FTDJ9FA|5|They work great converting my third brake light to led.
B00GFCUVUG|5|Works Great
B00PMXS7SM|5|just what I wanted. work gr8 so far. for the 3 weeks Iv had them.
B00LKQACE2|5|Worked perfect! Didn't have to buy a whole harness like the dealer stated. Took less than 5 minutes to replace the broken one.
B00VXVQ7ZM|5|Works great nice light hardly use much amps. Fits right in socket
B00407V4XG|5|Great match, very happy with this purchase. Who knew you would be able to find a match for an older vehicle like this 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
B00D9C2CDO|3|Love how much it holds. Didn't like the clips were plastic. Would have felt much better if they were metal. I actually threw a couple of my own tie downs over the top to make myself feel better. I did get rained on and everything inside stayed dry.
B00J7RB72M|2|Well when I purchased this product I thought it might be too good to be true. So i decided I wont put the full 120 cds in it but I didnt expect what I got. After putting approximately 75 cds in and zipping it close, the item simply gave out and broke. The zipper split. After looking into returning a product I learned I would have to pay half the amount I spent just to exchange it.<br />I shouldve just invested more money and gotten a hard case.<br /><br />Lesson learned.
B000BRF1U6|4|Works exactly as advertised.
B0016KABFC|3|The hook on the strap is too small to clasp onto my jon boat's eyelet (it's too small for the eyelet on my Lowe Stinger too).  I will return it and go with a Sea Sense or BPS brand. Bub the winch itself is well made and beefy and would've worked just fine.
B000ALIT2K|5|Works great and they fit well. My suggestion of you don't have the star style socket, a 1/4 inch works too.
B006CPMGEA|4|Delivered as promised and got what I paid for.
B00NMOYPVG|5|I have used it a few time now and like it a lot.  I am using it for automotive purposes, but would be nice to have a purge option.  I will update my review if anything goes wrong since it is kinda expensive.
B00KXE3Q3Q|5|I love it
B0014BEMVW|5|Cheap and effective. Just fill the small bottle with used oil as you are draining it, fill out the included form, and then send via UPS or FedEx (I have heard of problems sending via USPS) to one of the addresses on the included stickers. My results came back in about two weeks, and all seemed healthy with my used oil sample.<br /><br />All you need to buy is this kit; there are no other lab fees or other requirements in order to receive your results. This is the most inexpensive oil analysis kit I have found, and the results were just as clear and easy to read as any other, possibly more popular kits out there.
B001TPSVW4|5|Good buy
B00AANC76W|5|Excellent product
B006P8SMJM|3|Very easy to install but does not keep system pressure like the OEM. When I turn my key on I now have to wait for a few seconds to turn it on because it doesn't hold the pressure.
B0009IQZH0|1|Works OK, really afraid of spraying this on for fear of getting it on the paint or getting &#34;spin off&#34;. I just put it on a cotton cloth and wiped it on. Apparently this can damage the car's finish. So I am not going to risk ruining the body just to get real shiny tires..
B001GH5O9S|5|Great Kit! Easy to install!! Fast shipping
B005XRQSAQ|5|They look great and make that eclipse butt look newer
B000EQN2FA|4|Work for me so far
B00FXCXIEK|5|love it. easy to install and looks real good. i live in the California desert so it still gets very hot inside my jeep. but the roof is no longer cooking my head.
B000IZ2XF2|1|I had reservations about it at first... Figured there is no way it leaks or why would it be for sale. Thought clever idea you entire oilchange can be done by hand. I was wrong. It leaks. Bad. A drip about every 3 to 4 seconds on mine.
B00JFALCVW|4|It fits my 2015 Toyota Rav 4 XLE. Was fairly easy to install, and took about 20 minutes. I left the windows rolled up the recommended 72 hours. I rolled them down today, and they are all on there snug. The automatic windows roll up just fine, without going down by themselves. The ventshades make my Rav 4 look sportier, and more stylish. Can't wait until it rains to test them out. Since I live in Southern California, that might take awhile. Only negative I can think of, is that when the front windows are rolled up, they make slight contact with the ventshades, but not enough, in my opinion, to be causing any damage.
B0050LWFNO|5|The original mini shades in my car allowed the sun to bake me in the summer months. The zippie shade blocks the sun completely. I'm overly satisfied with my purchase! Delivery was fast. Thanks Amazon and zippie shade!!
B00AQJZ2OO|1|The key only would work but not unlock the doors with the buttons
B000CFO0KY|5|Got fast, just as listed.
B00842A7F4|5|I ordered this pack because I needed new rivet clips in order to install my new bumper on my Honda Civic. These fit in perfectly and did the job and I haven't had any problems. Thank you!
B00FP0LHA2|1|Doesn't snap in well. Just a little movement makes it stop charging and comes unplugged. Sometimes says accessory not supported.. Waste of money.
B0055PD1H4|5|Great! Works as describes! One thing though: don't let it get on glass! It's realy tuff to wash it off the glass! Just a tip!
B0067ECW72|5|High quality at a great price...Amazon rocks!
B00KL3ALGO|4|Good stuff. Keeps the sun out of my son's eyes. Sticks to the window with some Saran Wrap type substance on one side. So far works well. The only complaint my wife has is that it doesn't cover the whole window but that is probably her fault for not measuring. If she is reading this, it is actually my fault. I take the blame.
B00CDW2MCM|4|Works well, but don't drop it.  I dropped mine and the gauge function no longer works.
B001CUNFGI|1|Sad😩 good price, unable to ship to California
B00MOR4D5U|5|Very good
B00757KJTI|1|Save your money and time. Will be returning tomorrow. Put this on my truck today and went through the scan option in the radio and the antenna only picked up on four or five stations with clear tuning. All other stations had to be manually tuned to and were staticy and unclear.
B0000BYPXM|5|Great product and fast shipping!
B0002L6XPI|5|Works perfectly. Just as descibed
B00DSS9OBW|5|works great
B000X21YW8|5|Perfect
B00OMBC182|5|Perfect!!
B000S5IBNK|5|Great product fast shipping
B00DP5D51I|5|Great for TCP in combining this set specially if doing small projects. It has the 8oz cup which I need more than any other size cup and very difficult to find. Made my life easier and less waste.
B00NEL75GO|5|GREAT, FITS GOOD ...
B0002MABGE|1|I really wanted a barrier to keep the dogs from moving about for safety concerns but this product basically sucks.  The bars that go across don't stay up & keep sliding downwards.  The screws that were provided don't cut it as far as stabilizing the horizontal bars from sliding downwards.  It is too late to return this item - lesson learned.  I threw the product away - I couldn't justify bringing it to Goodwill and disappointing another poor soul.
B002MQCY7C|5|Easy to install, makes fastening the helmet strap a &#34;Snap&#34;
B00D1CQVIY|5|Works great and easy install
B00IJLCU64|5|This seat cover met our needs, was well made looks very nice in the truck.
B004N7YTL2|5|Exact replacement for my 2006 Dodge Magnum SRT8. Black background exactly like the picture shows. Came preloaded with light bulbs. Bolts right into place with no issues and can't tell the difference from the OEM part. Bought left and right and each was individually boxed and package inside of another box and arrived without any damages.
B00B2LCE1E|5|cured my problems
B00OYR59NI|5|everything I needed to cover all the bolt heads
B004GFTC0E|5|Worked great
B00JOY6U7U|5|Excellent quality and very fast delivery
B008KM81E2|5|So far this has been an amazing product! My car is nice and shiny! We had to purchase the 3 pack because we had heard such great reviews. I will second all the great reviews and say that this is better than other waxes on the market!
B00J2CI8UG|5|These Led light bulbs are great. I put them on truck to match the 10k HID's I have installed already. Love the new look of my truck.
B00DSD60CS|5|It looks awesome and was delivered on time. I would recommend...
B00SSKUHAC|5|Fits great and serves its purpose.
B000HTPMFC|5|A
B000S2SHZK|1|This part did not work at all even after resetting A/C.  Not sure if this was an original defect part.
B008BTAWP0|5|very heavy, as you might expect; I'll be getting a light U lock like for when I just go to the store and use the On Guard only for lengthy situations; a heavy lock down is needed no matter what you ride; years ago they stole my rusty old Murry, and recently a heavy Mongoose mountain bike that was 10 y/o, beat up and with so many problems it was barely rideable.
B000C5AMOM|4|Successfully received and installed.  I am holding back a star until I actually start the engine!
B007ZGBLNW|3|Underwhelming light output. Very bright when looking into them, but don't put out much light if using as a driving type light. Better for use as a work light as the light is much better when used close up, and expect to buy 4 of them before you get a useful amount of light. I installed these on the front bumper of my truck, and replaced them because I wasn't happy with the output. I instead used these and backup lights for a jeep. Worked well but I wanted more light so I added a second pair. Finally with 4 lights installed, I am happy with the light output for use as backup or work/load light.
B00BMTZRWY|5|Does the job!
B00K890RBU|5|works perfect, fast shipping
B00OW204W6|4|works well easy to mount, however changing the bulb is a pain wires a little short.
B00YJL95XY|4|They fit perfectly and work good. I hope life is better than stock ones that had both side springs broke.
B00853KY8C|5|great piece
B000BQPIGY|5|Best glass cleaner I have ever found.  Bought a case as the price was the best.  Keep it available in every room I have glass to clean including my car.
B000CKNSPM|1|Piece of junk, broke as soon as I turned it on
B00HV1F6L4|3|Product covers well, but the color does not seem to be an exact match for my Ford F150.
B00LV2UNL2|5|For one, the shipping was fast fast fast!!!! And two, the color of the product matches the photo shown! Beautiful, vibrant pink! And three, you can easily tell its high quality material. Its very strong, not flimsy at all, and the paint is high quality too! Very, very happy with the product and the great service I received.
B0049J6WK0|4|Works as advertised on my 1.8L 2001 Nissan Sentra...Just be sure you measure for gasket fitment, Amazon recommendation for the gasket was not the proper one for my Nissan
B00KVNNVW0|3|I love this lower strut bar easy to put on looks good when driving from behind...the down side is that you can put them on you're self but need to take it in for an alignment chang cause the tire will be nagitve camber
B004YWPF1Y|1|These are only pure white.. I do not see any hint of blue from these light bulbs.. I bought two pairs of 10000K and a pair of 12000K from Kensun to test and all three looked the same just &#34;white&#34;... I am guessing they are all 8000K. The packaging is not sealed and it felt like their products are all mixed..
B012TYSVXW|1|This does not fit a 2010 Kia Sedona
B00B5OB7O8|3|The LEDs were shipped and everything was received in good condition. However when testing the LEDs before cutting and installing them I noticed 2 LEDs strips each had 3 non working LEDs on the end of them. When I went to figure out why they would turn on then bank off. I figured there is bad soldering on the inside of the led. I just cut off that series and wired them up anyway. Annoying but not enough to make me return it.
B00BD5GYF6|5|My daughter loved these seat covers. They fit perfect in her 2005 Pontiac G6.
B0012ATAZI|5|Went in easily
B00FP3668C|4|red lettering faded out
B001CQWM8E|5|Great quality! 2015 rzrs 900
B00VL9LNVO|4|nice but they are about 8500k  lights not 6500k as I thought they gonna be.
B001G4Z5J0|3|This was a big problem. This did not come with any hardware. I am 1000% sure there was no hardware and triple checked every inch of packing materials. I had to spend a lot of time at Lowes and spent $48.50 out of pocket for the required hardware. The carrier is good but not having the hardware has put a bad taste in my mouth about this product!
B005N2TLYQ|5|Perfect fit, great look and great grip. Love that fact that it has a cushion right on the knuckles. I got pegged not too long ago and these gloves did the job with that knuckle protection. I stick to these brands so I knew I was in for great quality.
B00MV654UM|5|Easy to cut and apply.
B004SJL8DM|5|Super fast delivery! Couldn't travel until received this part...now I'm on the road again!
B00KY0HGI0|5|Delivery was prompt and fit perfectly! Cranked over motor first turn!
B00ACDP6YU|5|Good price, on time.
B00CTVN3DY|5|Use it everyday
B00F9LPJ8S|2|I would not buy this battery again. because a new lead acid battery would last at least a week without being charged unlike this battery.
B004GDLI4O|5|Good
B000IE0EZO|5|a nice tool to be safe
B007USCM7E|5|good
B00AQ4A6N6|4|Pros: Fits my car  perfectly. The ball bearings on the sway bar are nice and tight.<br /><br />Cons: The actual bar itself on the sway bar is half the thickness of the OEM sway bar. The thinness concerns me as I fear the bar could end up warping or bending under stress or that it could fail prematurely.  Hopefully this is not the case., only time will tell.
B00BI3WLHS|5|Nice item.
B000HUO4IC|5|Pros: Fits my car perfectly.  Quality of the gasket is actually better than the OEM gasket. :o)<br /><br />Cons: None. :o)
B00029J3BQ|5|Removed my Flowmaster 40series and installed these dynaflow super turbo's! Very happy very nice rumble without all the interior noise! Expect louder than stock but half of what a chambered would produce! Highly recommend!
B00K6B9RCA|5|Met all expectations
B005OK987W|1|NOT Permanent Adhesive!!! Will not work on shirts. Some newer Q&As discuss this, but I purchased back in May and just started to have time to make the shirts I wanted.    The adhesive pealed right off the shirt. Some of the sticky residue (glue looking) stayed on the s*** however. I wish the product description would have been better. I'm sure people who like this material for other projects like it. Just disappointed that after HOURS of reading product descriptions and comparing prices that I would choose the one that isn't in fact Permanent!
B0076I8T5W|5|I like them . Smooth, quiet and they don't dirty my rims as much as other brands I've tried
B004S12VEA|1|Save your money.
B000CN7B4I|5|Bought this to lube Hellwig sway bar bushings for my F150. Installer had either forgotten to use lube or did not use enough so the squeaking over bumps was annoying. This stuff works great, just be sure to use several pairs of gloves when applying because it will stick like crazy.
B001OMVCIC|5|Great product I tow a 29' travel trailer and it hold it level with 30 psi
B00R0424JO|5|Great LED bed lights!! I was able to connect them together and connect them into my dome light switch in the dashboard, so they come on witht the interior lights. SUPER, SUPER BRIGHT!! Love, love love them, and many of my friends want them for their trucks!
B00FJ5LBOA|5|aaa
B007RVQXVA|5|Had for over a year, no issues yet on my 2003 base auto rsx. Works great.
B000CLV3QW|5|super
B006TMKCL0|4|fits ok
B0009H51B2|5|GREAT WASH PRODUCT, SUDS LAST VERY WELL
B00Z89I2OY|5|These are great and easy to install
B00NIOBC1G|5|Unfortunately my Honda Element has decided to permanently hold onto the included DC cord from my cooler, a design flaw by Honda.  I was forced to purchase a second cord for use in other vehicles.  Same quality as all other ARB products.
B004VXJFG2|1|What the &(%&^ was Mopar thinking?! This doesn't attach to the &#34;cargo management&#34; system in the back of my KL at all. I'm going to have to rig up something to keep it in the back and from sliding all over the place. It has little nubs on the bottom that are supposed to stop that and don't. The dividers just snap in and collapse when any pressure is on them. Horrible design and I could have gotten something similar from the local auto parts store that performed the same for half the cost. Maybe if the handle went the other direction, the feet held it in place, and the walls all around were taller and sturdier this could be useful. Save your money.
B00DY78RWY|1|I was so disappointed because I received this and followed instructions, reviewing them several times but it would not work. It would not even turn on. Now I can nor return it for a refund.
B00LEZEER0|4|The holes that mount the locks for the bags are not the same as the factory.  When you install the locks using the  factory  bolts for the locks the plastic  turns white and cracks
B000C9LCJW|1|This is NOT the upper hose for a Hummer H3 with the 3.5/3.7 liter motor.
B00GHT8NM0|5|thanks  very good
B00I4NPZK0|5|Really cute and durable. I would definitely buy from this seller again!
B000CCIDAA|4|Product as described and arrived quickly.  Good vendor
B00O7SBMMG|5|Fast ship,good price
B009OEMJL6|5|Perfect fit for my 06 Dodge Ram.
B000UZPPKA|5|I use this for the last line of defense against moisture and it works. Only wish it has an indicator if it's already saturated.
B00ZQV8BMW|4|Love the lights they work great
B00VX2NOK2|4|This was very easy to install, and worked well right away.<br />It is surprisingly handy to get information that your car does<br />not provide (such as RPMs in a hybrid or engine temp)
B00WOXTW3W|5|This part was for my 2010 Nissan rogue. The part fit perfectly and it was delivered on time.
B008HRX0YQ|3|Great fitment and product but I had a slight hole in a weld at the top within 5k miles
B00VVFNHXA|5|Works great.  Easy install, took less then an hour in the driveway. 1998 Wrangler
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Plenty big to fit my F150
B00P2K08J6|5|Love Love It, Works Great!
B004VSDQF8|5|I am happy to report that these have left my boat, car and truck smelling wonderfully for the past 3 weeks. In response to the other review that said the smell dissipated quickly, mine are still going strong. I bought these after the truck i purchased had these under the seats. While cleaning I discovered them and couldn't be happier I found them. I needed to know what was keeping the truck smelling so good. In the boat I air dry it after every outing, but I decided to put these in to keep the boat April fresh.
B00CODRQ6C|5|Exactly as described.  Perfect fit for my 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe.  Took me about 20 minutes to install.  Simple installation.  Highly recommend instead of paying someone  to install a hitch for you.
B00KD3G01M|5|Excellent product! Fits my Chevrolet Suburban armrests perfectly and they look like new now! Take your time in putting them on and they will look great! Thank you! Highly recommend!
B008BWJ3CA|4|Extra bright
B005MRFFWY|5|Accurate, great product !
B00KLNJQEM|3|Fuel reading is still not correct after many tanks of gas. I've run out of gas now twice when I still had 40+ miles left
B000VKRQDI|5|Just installed in my AP1 and it was a breeze! I don't know when the previous owner replaced it but the old one was absolutely filthy. Kinda looked like a bird exploded and ended up getting caught by the filter. Will buy again when the time comes!
B0006N5RW2|4|Served its purpose. Seems like a well made piece.
B000EDOST2|5|It would help 100% if we knew what type of awning this strap is being used on, the old style awning, or the new.
B0079IBOG0|3|I bought these and according to their sizing guide i was a medium or a large, I went with a medium and they were too small... So if your buying in between sizes I would recommend going with the larger size! They are a little tight, but look like nice good quality gloves... wish I could wear them :(
B004HCS4NW|2|This item did not clean my convertible top.
B00261FNB2|5|great bracket, it holds my 35 inch tire just fine
B00Y12ZU7G|5|nice stuff
B000EQ9P1A|4|Works as intended
B003V57NUQ|5|It was just what  I was looking for.
B002Y2WIP2|5|Arrived on the dot, excellent condition, and everything was hassle-free. Product was a breeze to install, thank you!
B00DIV0YZ4|5|Great product at a great price
B00IK19YWQ|5|Fast shipping and great product!
B00HE9319C|4|good
B0009OMYDS|5|Just what I was looking for.  Fast shipping  A+++++
B00G4UI4Z8|5|Excellent product.  Exceeded expectations.
B003VLBPJA|4|Just a standard bungie net. Nothing special.
B00WUOA9JQ|1|It says it's for a 09 to 14 in the description but inside the box on the instructions says 09 to 13 and when I put it on my 2014 ram truck the middle bracket doesn't line up on either side when u put the bracket were its suppose to the holes don't line up with the ibroad in middle
B000GU24HG|2|Rips to fast!
B007TO3Z02|2|Expect a DARK GREY non Translucent  paint which does not have a smooth finish.  The Only good thing is that it can be easily removed.
B010HDR3Q8|5|I got this bulb to replace another that I felt was dim.  This made a very big difference and is a huge improvement!  Initially I had reservations about the size of the heatsink on the back -- my other bulb, from another vendor and store, did not have any heatsink -- as not being able to fit the location I need it for.  That was a non-issue; this fit perfectly, and with room to spare.<br /><br />The bulb I got is very bright and has a cool white color.  I would've preferred warm white, but that wasn't an option with the 5630 LED chips.  The brightness helps though.  I highly recommend it.
B00IOWDV2K|5|really cute.
B000UX3Z3G|5|Worked great. Just as described.
B004B1C8TA|3|I received the frame but not opened it till last Saturday after I received my license plate for my new car.  After my husband finished installation, I found that one of the crystal was gone.  I checked all the package and couldn't find the crystal.  Since it had already been installed, I didn't want to take it out and return it.  Anyway, please make sure you checked the frame before the installation.
B000CICZ1M|5|Perfect  fit and works awesome
B002R4NG1M|1|Holes after used 3 times. not worth the money spent.
B00HX1NWHM|5|Great
B00BG6IJA0|5|bought this for my husband.  He is happy with it fitting under low profile cars
B00K8SE6PE|1|Incorrect product
B00DQU9Y94|3|This thing is HUGE! could cover a limo. One size fits everything.
B007KPSRE4|5|They seemed really difficult at first to put on, but after I figured it out they went on really easy.
B00BVPOC20|2|Didn't fit.  It was severely stuck, causing my shifter to not be able to go into park without jamming a screwdriver in which eventually snapped my cover.  They were really nice about it, but they said they couldn't do anything about it.  I ordered a second one from another company and it fit just fine.
B0006JLW34|4|Good product and should do the job intended.  I wish the actual drain hole had a projection so that a small hose could be added to drain the water away to the outside like my old one had.
B00BLPS29E|3|I purchased this exact item from a motorsports retail store and loved it. A larger lock area so it fits well around my bike bars and a 4 number combo adds additional protection from theft. My problem is not to do with the current one I purchased here on Amazon. My concern is the buttons you push down to open the lock on my other one, after only 4 uses broke and became unusable. Which is tjjr reason I purchased this one. I have not used my new one yet. However, I do plan on using it this week. As I mentioned earlier, I am worried this one will do the same. I will keep you posted on any issues.
B000FPZXW0|3|They are about the same a height as the thirty year old ones I removed... Just OK
B00ACN3EBW|5|Arrived on time, fit perfectly and fixed my cars vacuum leak.
B000C9QDMS|5|Exact copy of original. The leads were much longer than needed to give you flexibility in routing the wires.
B011N9OD54|5|Had to get a resistors for my elantra because of the hyperflash problem...<br /><br />But they worked like a charm (very useful)
B00DLKPXI0|5|It looks great and was easy to install
B0000AZ8JB|5|Great value! Good quality.
B006WPQNB2|5|Excellent quality down to the fragrance. Very picky wife and kids loved it.
B00OTJ7SJE|3|I did not find these much brighter than the cheaper LEDs that came in the complete kit to do my whole truck for the same price. I would say skip these and go with a full kit. The housing looks very nice with a good heat sink
B00RV417XM|5|These lights are excellent, and a cheap way to add super bright driving lights to your bike for $20 instead of $200 plus like kuryakn or others want to charge. Installed on Yamaha Vstar 1300T and instantly added bright driving lights and turn signals. I did get the hyper flash after installing these, but I actually don't mind as I believe it's better visibility. I have since swapped out all bulbs on my bike to various JDM LET'S. I have nothing bad to say.
B000P6WM9Q|1|I bought this particular rolling head pry bar because it was made by the Otawanna Tool Co, an American firm which has a good reputation.  When the tool arrived it did not look like the picture on the box and in the Amazon ad.  Rather, it looks like a piece of round stock which has been bent over at a 90 degree angle.  The box says &#34;Made in China&#34;, but the tool has USA embossed on it, so not sure if the tool was made in the US or not.  Either way, the packaging and advertising are deceptive since they have obviously changed their manufacturing process.
B007SQZV9E|5|What fun. Love this silhouette.  Easy to apply.  Wears well.
B00O3QB67S|1|Didn't fit as advertised.
B002OJXMZ0|1|one of the new lines leaked I had to reinstall one of the old lines
B000QS2XQK|5|Pretty accurate.  I am using it for automotive purposes.  The beeper for auto charge isn't loud though ohh well I just needed a good scale.
B00GBQ3YXM|5|Great quality and value for the price.  Beat every new price from trailer sales shops by $100.  Easy to install.  Only drilling required was for the sway control bracket mounted to the trailer.  Remember to hitch the trailer to the truck and install J bars and chains, ensure trailer and truck are straight and level before drilling holes for sway control bracket.
B003S6F3IC|5|Works great plug and play
B002K4421C|1|Part starting leaking after one month
B001GMXA2G|5|If you can change your oil, you can install this kit.  Very simple to install, they should have included a few more zip tie's.
B00U208PQO|5|Gloves fit perfect. Very comfortable use them all the time when riding
B000C57UEW|5|used them on my vega project. worked great.
B00NQUSNIC|5|They work perfect and my tire never went flat again. They are very easy to equip.
B005RNEH5O|5|awsome stuff
B00BTSGXWG|2|These are not waterproof got stuck in a storm and now they crack and pop no true sound. They also get blown pretty easy not worth the money.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Awesome product. Holds a charge for months!!!
B000Q5RQZG|5|packaged in one box - delivered as promised
B00239V7EE|3|Kinda geeky but okay.
B007BKG4SE|5|thank you
B00407RSXQ|4|I'm still trying to match the color and shine of the original Royal Blue  paint on my 2008 Civic. The local auto parts store advertised that they had my color in stock, but when I went there I found that the paint was in the form of brush on touch up paint, which is hard to apply to obtain a smooth finish. The auto parts store had a spray can of a Ford color called Royal Blue, which I purchased and applied, but the color was not even close to the Honda Royal Blue. I ordered the Duplicolor Honda Royal Blue from Amazon. It was twice the price of the auto store, but Amazon sent the right color. So, it was worth it. The color matches, but the finish is not as shiney, even after I applied with the Duplicolor clear coat paint. I have read that you should allow the paint to dry for 30 days before polishing, so I am in the wait phase.
B00QGMD9F4|5|Not bad replacement. See better!
B00G9W9TK0|5|Definitely on the large end of tank bags. I will probably only use this on long rides (over 100 miles). Love the phone and gps holders!!!
B00IOBSYB4|4|This is a really good product. The only drawback is it doesn't last very long
B0013TOO90|1|Wrong size for chain saw.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Works great!
B0031CCP98|5|Super! Thanks for the great product at a good price! It was easy to install (with the guidance of my cousin), & would purchase again when/if needed. I appreciated the timely shipping, & adequate packaging. Thank you!
B007N31CRW|5|Great quality! Used to stabilize our teardrop camper! Rugged construction.
B004ICWBFI|5|Great price for a great sticker.
B00HS0H6W0|5|Great product.
B000CPCLEG|5|Perfect fit on my 64 Impala
B007CN9IJW|3|Slides tight as needed, but wife hates it.
B007EHOWNI|5|Fast shipping! Great Item!
B00ES5Q7GO|5|good
B000IY7ZWO|5|looks and works great
B0028JQYSS|5|Good product
B000HBNUIG|5|So far what is not to love. It gets grease off your hands nicely. Although this is not the reason i bought it. I bought it to remove some mystery stains on my leather seats caused by my toddler. I have still yet to see if it will come out but so far very pleased with this lotion/gel like cleaner.
B009FUFCDQ|5|Fast Service everything went great, fast mailing
B00MNFOUE2|5|Looks beautiful. Installed on 2014 ninja 300 abs edition and it fits it perfectly. Easy to install.
B00IGZQGAY|5|Excellent quality.Worth every dollar.Would definitely recommend these Subaru mats.
B000E7BBL6|5|Perfect for what we use it for, good price, fast service!
B00DNISOZE|2|The rear seat cover does not fit my car and the front covers barely fit. The wheal cover and belt pads are decent, but the floor mats suck. the Non Slip material on the drivers side mat is anything but non slip. Having that mat in your car is a safety hazard.
B00E4CQGVW|5|Fast shipping and great product!
B00HZ86XG0|2|Does not work on 2012 Ford F250's. Fortunately, I was able to contact the seller and return it.
B000GZL29M|2|It did its job. The light read out was unpredictable. Sometimes it would say charged when it was dead and vice versa.
B00U1PIFME|5|Old school nostalgia .
B00DDVU6EI|5|A+ fuel additive.  Added 2 MPG to my gas mileage
B00RM26HH4|4|Works as expected
B0050SI7Q6|5|Extremely fast delivery rock solid product👍
B00IFPA4AI|5|Installed with ease and works perfectly.  Came with Acura warranty from Acura dealership and priced much better than elsewhere.
B000GVIL3Q|5|Fit like a tight pair of panties!
B0013T7OL0|5|Received on time and the cushion is about what I expected.  Yes, there was some temporary smell, about what you'd probably expect from anything said to be made of leather.  Not sure if it is actually leather, but if not, the cushion does mimic it pretty well. They are easy to install, fit very nicely, are comfortable, and they will likely offer some protection to my OEM cloth seats, which is the reason I bought the cushions in the first place.  They seem to be well made and at first blush they do appear to be a product that will withstand the normal wear and tear to which it will be likely subjected.  As for the former, I could not find any defects in their workmanship, stitching and/or sewing points of contact, etc.; as for the latter, I just got the cushions so it's much too early in their usage to come to any conclusions as to their durability.  At any rate, for the price I paid I am satisfied with the cushions - thus far.
B00Q88P6UC|5|Worked great for the winch install in my 2015 Ranger 570 Crew Full Size.
B004AQUAJG|5|Received successfully and installed.
B00OD6XJ9Q|5|Fits great!
B00FM1CKK0|5|I love it 💕
B007V2EGCS|5|Fit perfectly, very high quality
B003YJI1XW|5|Good price, typical quality for RV materials.
B00HJ6SO8S|5|My husband loves this cover, it was super easy to install, (and he doesn't even know what he's doing) and no leaks so far.
B0058JQ71E|5|Outstanding quality and fit...
B0049EJCF2|5|As 1 of less than 10 new parts available in the world, I am happy with this.  This fits a 2005 Jeep Liberty CRD 2.8l diesel.  This has the transmission oil cooler (TOC) at the bottom, which made sourcing it next to impossible.  Installation took about 2 hours, due to removal of front grill and misc. braces.
B004I14MZQ|5|Plugged right in, works great. Even comes with all the bulbs installed.
B00OK68XK4|3|Good
B000C9MFEI|5|Glad I spent the extra money on AC Delco. Two gaskets included depending on raised rib configuration on your pan. Nice to be all done, fill trans and look underneath. No drips. Follow torque figures and adhere to them. Tighter ain't better. 700R4 ...140 inch pounds...borrow a torque wrench to do it right if you don't have one.
B000F5HUUI|5|Works as expected!!!
B003XU6E6I|5|Gloves fit true to size, bought a large got a large.  The carbon fiber knuckle protectors seem like they would do the job in a fall, don't want to find out though.  Comfortable, cool, definitely not for Fall or winter riding. I have an older pair of Olympia gloves, like eight years old and they are still going strong.  In my opinion a good overall buy for the money.
B00UM9UCE8|1|I asked that this item be replaced with one that fits my 2015 Hyundai as it says it fits. I appears as thought they are sending me the same wrong item
B0007ZAJRM|5|After trying shudder fix I'm sold on this company's products. Just added this to an 87 Chevy van with 700R4 rebuilt trans during a fluid change. Shifts are different, like driving with a different transmission. Quick, smooth, firm. Good stuff
B000Q0K5SQ|5|fixed the knock in my 2005 chevy tahoe steering wheel
B004I9UOAA|5|Great! Arrived in time
B00S9OM0GQ|5|Looks very pretty. 😁
B000C16XLC|5|Wonderful product
B00SUYEPY0|5|Good product
B002LKJD7S|5|Arrived quickly and was the correct part
B00P2RYKYS|5|I have a 2009 Sienna Limited, the one on the vehicle was completely melted and felt like goo, it smudges our hand every time we touch it, so that got to go. This purchase fit like a glove and so easy to replace. Just go on YouTube and look for installation instruction, there are tons of them there, any Sienna 2004-2009 are the same. So glad I got mine replaced.
B007QB59DO|5|Fits perfect on my 2012 BMW X5 e70 thanks
B005RF6G4M|4|it is clumsy to handle inside the car, but I guess anything this big would be.
B006JN46NY|5|Very easy to install and to use
B00J52R3AE|3|This is our 2nd camping trip with this and it's day 4 and still not working.  We have spent hours moving it from on location to another trying to get it to work.  Multiple calls to Winegard tech support who never answers and must always leave a message. It's been 2 1/2 hours so far today with no response yet.  We have followed the steps over and over and still won't work so we need a tech to walk us thru it because the directions suck.  I expected much more from the product and hoped after a couple times it would get easier.  The 1st time we had a few issues but with tech support we were able to get it set up for the week.  Either tech support is too busy or they are under staffed because I want help now not hours later. And no tech support after 3:30 on Saturday when most people camp on weekends.  I just want step by step instructions of what to do if this happens.  Is there a gadget to use to find that perfect location?  My husband is ready to kick it across the road.  4 hours after 1st call to tech support I finally received a call and lady was able to help get it set up.  We have Direct TV receiver Model HR/24-500 that they said can be touchy to set up.  Trick was after signal strength had been confirmed to have some over 70 she had me hit the red reset on receiver and wait.  It works now!  Hoping each trip will get easier once we learn all the tricks of set up and can modify my review again as I want to be happy with my purchase.
B00KDDAR66|5|Great little button. Well built, I am using it as a 12v DC solenoid switch. It's very small.
B00EVQHYOE|1|Sound like a bicycle horn
B000RMRY64|1|Advertised as a 6 pack, but you only receive one can. Disappointed.
B00IP7C328|4|Just got today.  Fit nice look good hopefully clean up well and stay looking new. So far so good.

B004WLRP74|4|5 larger scrapers for big stuff, five smaller scrappers for fine detail stuff, the price warrents a 4 but the smaller pieces are kind of weak so they will start to bend eventually if used daily like I use them. Ive used the larger ones to scrape out my lawnmower and they are just fine so basically the intricate stuff will wear them out but the plus is you get the big pieces with it at this price!
B00DBEO7LA|5|Good
B00O83OQJQ|5|Muy buen producto. 100.% fast good
B0067UDG3K|4|Wasnt painted just bare metal. Maybe i missed that but overall perfect!
B001AMCCEO|4|I'm satisfied with the Gabriel HiJacker Air Shocks.  I bought these because the air bladder is covered by the steel tubing of the shock.  In previous experiences with older Ford pick-ups, the brake lines rub against the shocks, it's really not a problem with the metal tubing of the shocks but if the bladder is exposed the brake lines can rub against it and eventually wear into it causing a leak.  These were easy to install on the '96 F-250 but do drop the spare tire from it's stock location for better accessibility.  I installed them several weeks ago and have not noticed any air leaks.  These do not add the carrying capacity of larger &#34;air bags&#34; but if you're towing trailers with no more than about 500 to 600 pounds tougne weight these should work well for you.
B00EOM8ZSO|4|good
B00J533KOG|3|Dont expect amazing results but it gets the job done
B003UT3S6Q|5|I've used Sonax products for over 25 years now. I don't use theme exclusively but they're always at the top of my list. They tend to be a little more expensive but they also tend to be a little bit better.
B00B8OZFSE|5|Great product. Thanks
B002TPDSEO|5|Excellent shocks
B0028321V8|5|Great product. Thanks
B00HMRDPBK|5|Awesome
B007USCM7E|5|simple to use and saves a ton of money
B0006I0N8U|5|I have had to replace this lock in my RV screen door at least 4 times in the last 8 years. The center plunger that moves when you push on the handle is made of cheap pot metal and breaks. Sure would be nice if the manufacturer used a stronger metal.
B00MHDL0O8|5|It's fine- it is $10 and looks good and works good
B00M9ITQT2|5|NICE Accent - Should have come on the bike from the factory!
B00153BEA6|5|The best inverter I ever had
B0023VFO78|4|It fit perfect. The rubber seal is a little small in the trunk though.
B000L9R698|5|Awesome lock.<br />I'm happy with the purchase.
B00MGV0V3C|2|the product arrived with a chip on the corner.  I returned it for a refund.
B00B1TNQCS|5|Got this for my 2015 Tacoma Truck. Now the stuff in the back doesn't slide like before. Highly recommend this,  no more sliding and extra protection for the trick bed.
B00KDNTV18|5|easy to install, light is brite and works fine with all connections,  get it !!
B0032H6QJ2|1|This was not the right size for my truck and now it says the windo to return item has expired. I am not happy with losing $310!
B006XG7TM2|5|I love this sheild. If you've got a C5 Vette you know where the air goes in to your motor can collect all kind of ishh! This can significantly harm your radiator or ev m the motor. This sheild covers the area and it looks great doing it. I've put these on three corvettes and the durability has been terrific, they have not faultered in any respect. This is one of those items that you can be proud to show your friends and now that your doing yourself a very big favor by putting this on your Vette!
B00I2WZ6Q6|5|Perfect
B000GU3B32|5|Fender worked as expected
B00WKZXXW0|5|Clear, looks good, and works.
B000EBMKAS|5|I'm so glad I have a place to put the annoying E&I papers as well as insurance cards and registration. It's cleaned up my glovebox!
B000XECJES|5|They do exactly what they are supposed to
B005HMHVSA|5|Great  my daughter loves them in her car.
B00TE9UO3G|3|Loved the floor mats but everything els had stickers that don't stay to good.
B000C5YCZ2|5|As advertised
B007GCDM46|5|good price and fast delivery
B00IX0CTBW|5|Huge improvement when towing the camper!  Obviously it levels the load out but it rides so much better.  Great investment.
B00MZKET50|5|Exact fit for my Pathfinder.
B0082DZRPA|5|Nice
B00RW7WG1K|5|I am very happy with these wipers.  They clean well, conform to the shape of the windshield, and resist snow and ice buildup.  As an added bonus, they look great!  I will definitely order them again.
B007JSGR9Y|1|Completely sucked wouldn't work with my truck
B002RSIK4G|5|Works as advertised!
B00BZODG9W|2|This is a super cute Mirror Cover, and I would have loved to have given it more stars, but there were some issues.<br /><br />The Hello Kitty head is quite heavy for this type of item, so it tends to flop down in front of the mirror which could be a hazard. I didn't mind that too much, but a few months after putting this on my Mirror the elastic inside it snapped and now it is far too big to fit on the mirror. I thought about fixing it, but I think I will just make it into something else.
B00TLZPFXM|5|cool
B00D61DGKQ|5|Excellent choice.  Fitted perfect with my Ford Ranger.  It is very handly and manageable.
B009AA9WVY|5|Work great.
B00PCRX8MS|1|This switch is nothing more then and on off rocker switch with a picture of a horn on it. It is not a momentary switch.
B005JD3JTC|5|Love this chair!
B00WS3P37C|1|This product is just plain and simple stupid.  The nozzle comes with a &#34;quick connect&#34; - which may be okay with you but I find those things ALWAYS leak and I end up with wet feet and/or shoes.  But... I thought, okay fine... I just won't use that &#34;quick connect&#34; thing.<br />But NOOooooo!<br />And this is where it gets stupid.  The threads on the nozzles do not match up with the threads on your hose.  You MUST use the leaky quick connect if you want to connect this nozzle to your garden hose.  There may be some that DONT want to connect it to a garden hose.  But then, I don't know why you'd be buying this thing  anyway.<br />This is so stupid I am surprised AMAZON sells it.  And until some one can show me a compelling reason why this product is NOT stupid, I say shame on Blusmart and shame on AMAZON.
B0052UOTNC|5|This worked in my 2009 Nissan Pathfinder.  It took several attempts to program it myself but after I got the timing right, it worked perfectly.  My Nissan dealer wanted $ 124 for the exact same remote, without the key.  This works!
B000XQ9MGE|5|Works great
B0049GHVCQ|5|Bought This for my Parent's 2001 Sienna. Came well packaged in the factory box, though the box was opened when i received it. Fits just like to oem one. Installation when very smooth, works perfectly. Radiator build quality was just as good as the original, which is to say that is was very good quality. Highly recommend this radiator!
B006TMKVBQ|5|the part was perfect; exactly the same part & fit perfectly.  I was able to install it myself in less than 30 minutes.<br />I highly recommend this site.
B00CFJXUQK|5|Improved my ride quality and handling immensely compared to my old struts with 160K miles on them. Was easy to put on the car just took a bit of time. Took it to a mechanic for an alignment and I asked for the report, everything was perfectly within OEM specifications.<br /><br />There is much less body roll, the car feels much more like it should. It also no longer bottoms out on every bump in the road, and it doesnt bounce on the highway. If I ever buy a car over 100K miles again, replacing the struts will always be in the plans. It is completely worth it!<br /><br />KYB makes the OEM struts for toyota, so these are pretty close. If I had to guess though these are closer to the Corolla S struts than the Corolla LE struts. But that will matter little to most people, they are just a tiny bit stiffer than the OEM LE/CE/VE struts.
B003L33Q0O|4|fast shipping, item was as described
B00D9C2CDO|5|works greats. Keep some patches handy. It takes a beating and you might need to patch some spots but it's strong.
B008EQB7MM|5|Worked great.  Simple.
B00EODWM2I|1|I would NOT recommend this product for any application. I bought this for my 2005 WRX because I was changing to a STI intercooler. My tuner could not make it fit at all even after trimming. I ended up buying a OEM STI Y pipe kit. Which is what I should've done in the first place.
B000B68C08|5|worked great and quick shipment
B00S82MWGW|5|Worked perfect
B00DBH8W4K|5|***NOTE*** - This product for AUTO trans Jeeps!<br /><br />Recently purchased this simple product for my 2015 4-door JK. Upon unboxing, you can tell right away how robust and sturdy this pedal is. It has a powder-coated matte finish and some pretty good heft to it. The six holes on the pedal itself have slightly convex edges to provide positive traction between the pedal surface and your footwear. The predrilled holes on the side plate allow for the mounting of the pedal in 3 distinct positions. Packaging also includes some simple but detailed instructions as well as 2 hex-head bolts, 2 regular washers, 2 lock washers.<br /><br />I was going to type up some installation instructions but honestly, visual reference works better. Here's a video covering this awesome product along with how best to install it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H741gJAnzyM
B00318NT1K|5|Works
B00FFAUBAE|5|All as expected
B001F0M4I0|5|Just what I needed.
B00EAOIKVI|2|This filter is a great disappointment. After removing the old filter, I proceded to install the new one.  I noticed a real foul smell in the new filter before installation. I just thought it was the carbon or arm and hammer smell. I then installed it and buttoned it up. Wow it is even worse with fresh air blowing across it. This filter is a waste if you want fresh smelling air.  Not sure how much it absorbs oders. I won't be buying it again!!
B00IEL2H7G|1|They do not come with the right pieces to attatch to the car.  On the top piece the velcro wont stay closed and snags all of my clothes
B00471QLME|5|Nice !!
B00DW4YLLK|4|These are nice quality cans, I just don't like the &#34;safety&#34; spouts. But that was an easy fix with the EZ-Pour replacement spouts. Fit perfect! Now I've got the best gas cans around. My neighbors get jealous.
B004FCWH3W|5|Very nice product excellent!!!
B000FCP1GG|5|Best stuff for vinyl
B000BUQOAE|5|Works  great,use it only to drain , then rinse out good and then disconnect, then protect from Freezing In Winter.
B00CXMPR2E|5|I put it on my car and I love it!
B00N2ZFPN2|5|works great  no running out of gas on the course.
B00XZ78W3C|3|So I bought this as an extra roof rack to loan to friends who borrow my stuff.  It appears to be a copy of Thule bars and Yakima towers, except that Thule and Yak use steel with vinyl coatings and the Apontus is aluminum with a plastic coating. Installation is primitive compared to the Big Rack Companies, but it works. The bars I got were had a slight three or four degree bend in them. The installation instructions are primitive. By the way, Apontus is not a rack company, it's a Chinese import company. They also import patio umbrellas. Nice mix, eh? There is no fit guide for this rack to let  you know whether or not it works for your vehicle. There is a quandary here. Should you spend a bunch of money-- the Thule and Yakima bars alone are sold for about $80 a pair, the towers can be $100, the lock cores are expensive, but you end up with a product that, with a squirt of WD-40 once a year on the moving parts, will no doubt last for many years. The Apontus is a crapshoot, but I bought it, put some Yakima bike mounts on it and hit the road. Nothing fell off. I'll attribute that Yakima. This set up is also sold on the 'net under a couple other brands, but it appears to be the same unit. Do I recommend it? Well if you're poor and need a rack and if maybe it fits, there you go. If you want something that will last for several years, you know who those other guys are.
B00S1WDSK8|1|These lights are a cheap knock off.  The pictures on the details page are even knocked off.  The two duallys in the fog area are Rigid Ind. LEDs.  They stole the picture off their website.  Cheap Chinese junk that hurts the American Economy and breaks easy.  Even when compared to a legitimate LED light company these lights look like child's play.
B004A0WFQS|4|Perfect fit  for my 2012 Ford Escape XLT with a  3.0. Doesn't seem like you can go wrong with Fram air filters
B002L1FB32|1|Two weeks after installation, this gear cracked and leaked out steering fluid, making it difficult for me to steer. I did receive a replacement promptly. I had to pay for a second installation fee to my mechanic. They owe me.
B00029KA86|4|Grip worked as expected. I remember my grandparents having these on their vehicles when I was younger and wanted that nostalgic feel it brought. One tip I will give though is to really make sure you get the right size, especially on the width. thanks
B00HYHXUSQ|5|Very good fit and finish. The product was exactly as advertised. I would buy them again for another vehicle.
B00YVQD4A2|5|Good quality and aesthetically pleasing as well.
B0013HP98C|4|Great license plate frame, feels solid, comes with all the necessary hardware.  It fit the front bumper of my 2007 BMW 328xi just fine, but even the longer of the two slots wasn't wide enough to fit the screws for the rear plate on the same car.
B00YI3IGA6|5|Genius or crazy?!  The verdict is in... it's genius!  Windows shades come in all types of failed designs.  Tint that sticks to your window, roll up shades, suction cup shades etc...  They are all pretty terrible.  So what makes this idea genius?  It works very well at shading the child from the sun, it fits a wide range of car doors and VERY importantly you can roll down your windows while this is fully blocking the sun still.<br /><br />What is weird about it?  It goes on over the window frame of the door and half is on the exterior of the car and the material also gets slammed into the car door cracks when the door closes.  None of this bothers me.  To me it looks pretty good, albeit a tad weird being on the exterior.  The material does get mushed in the closing of the door, but it looks no worse for the wear so far.<br /><br />Will it fit your car?  I don't know.  It fit a Grand Cherokee window just fine.  It dd not fit an old Toyota pickup truck circa 1994 but since the material is so stretchy I was able to hook it onto the window roll-up handle and it works just fine like this.  If it is not a perfect fit get a little creative and you may be able to make it work.<br /><br />The material is soft and light and can but put into a very small pouch, we tuck it in the pouch behind the passenger seat and it takes up very little room in there.<br /><br />Cons?  When you look through both sides of the material (all the time) it is a little hard to see through.  Not really a problem in the bright sun, but inside a parking garage or at night time you may want to take a second to look around a little extra on the side with the shade.<br /><br />I may have misread the description, but I was pleasantly surprised this contained 2 when it arrived!
B002G47GE6|5|Very fast shipment, Quality product. easy to change.  Took less than 3 minutes to change both blades.
B000BQUEWC|5|great for organizing
B00CA5LS8G|1|They are junk.  Poorly made.  Do not buy.  They were all bent up.
B00D918I74|5|Great little product, well made and the company was a pleasure to deal with.
B000A8ONAU|4|Does NOT come with the button that attaches or glues to the glass.  I'm having no luck finding glue strong enough to hold the mirror so as of now I am not using it. Waiting for some strong stuff to come via UPS and hopefully that works.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Jumbo XL sun shade is everything that the other positive reviews said it would be! It fits like a glove on our MDX.
B000IYZSXM|5|super
B00C9B1PES|3|Okay
B00KLIWMCU|2|I have a 2007 Camry Hybrid. It does the job. It's a little wide and moderately keeps the heat out, but good enough. Shipping was quick. Thanks,  Update: Metal frame started to poke out of the shades after a few months. After folding it up 15 or 20 times, it's broken, I've tried to put it back in a few times but I give up. I feel like it's going to poke me in the eye. Maybe I got a dud. I'm going to try something else, maybe the old cardboard one will work better.
B000VU57YS|5|Easy to set up and seems to be quality material.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Simple and a very easy to read, and reset, gauge. I will never use any other tire pressure gauge.
B000GU2DEA|5|They was delivered fast and I've had no issues after I installed them.
B0097CDI4M|1|1st fob did not work. I called customer service and the gentleman happily replaced that.  It doesn't work also. I did receive great customer service!!!!
B0051D3MP6|3|Advertised specs do not indicate that this will not work if battery is completely dead.  Had to send it back.
B000G1WGD2|5|5 min to install!  Great build quality, highly recommended..
B0049CHW6A|5|Quality filter at discount price.
B005ZZH7G0|5|i have a toyota Tacoma 2015, this part you will see well
B006RW5NNY|5|Good quality easy to install.
B00TTLR8VK|3|Smells great, seems to clean well but I don't notice a difference from the cheaper store brand. For the average driveway car wash Joe you won't see any changes.
B00SCXCQV8|5|Great price !!!
B000BWCG90|1|didn't work at all. Almost impossible to get on hose.
B00MO70NSQ|5|Necessary item for OSHA regulations.  You can clearly see pictogram.  I'm happy to have found them on Amazon.
B00DX88L6G|5|great
B00OA9X74S|5|With a hefty price, this battery isn't for everyone. For me it has been well worth it (at least so far). It is the only battery I have found that will spin the All Balls starter on my high compression Harley without even the typical compression stroke hesitation that is typical when first pressing the starter button. That along with the internal management circuitry gives me great confidence in using this Lithium Iron battery. (Also of note: prior to buying the EarthX, I had burned through 2 Deltron Lithium Ion batteries which don't deliver the advertised CCA and have a tendency to burn out at their terminal connections.)
B0052SF0LO|1|The sensor on the original device we received didn't work.  They emailed suggestion for resetting but still not working.  They also sent a replacement that worked for an afternoon but then stopped working.<br /><br />The light will turn on when switch to &#34;On&#34; but the Auto doesn't work.  We will keep charging both and testing, but will likely need to ask for refund.<br /><br />TIP:  TEST BEFORE INSTALLING.  That is, set up and charge using solar panel and test Auto and On before installing on home or elsewhere.
B00J6C22TK|5|Great
B000BZYW3U|5|fits perfectly to my jeep cherokee xj 4x4 1995, i am very satisfied with the product
B001QVTIM8|5|Great product
B00S2096AK|4|Yes I love them! They worked perfect for both him and I. Not to girlie for him and not to mannish for myself. Great symbolization for our wedding year.
B00HZVWPFU|5|Here's the spoiler I bought on my 2010 accord!!!
B002GTKAHQ|4|They fit nice on my xr650r
B00JH23JW8|5|Fits perfect in a Yamaha VSTAR 650
B00CG4BFLQ|4|Material a bit thinner than oem, but the paint job was spot on.
B00WWZW91Y|5|So pretty on my wall
B00IEYDEWK|4|Tires were good, as described.  The galvanized dip coating was very uneven and had drips and runs on them,  was expecting a bit better for the rims, but for the price will not complain much.  I would but again.
B00NLUU1SC|5|Very bright LEDs. Recommend to all.
B001TLC12E|3|Did not fit my 2009 f150

B007MJHJT2|5|As described, on time.
B000CF1VC4|5|Plug and play for my 04 Mazda 3 2.3L.  A few squirts of PB blaster on my existing O2 sensor and a few big tugs with a breaker bar and within 15 minutes i had swapped the sensor.  No engine lights, it's had some decent mileage put on it including a couple track days already and no issues.
B004SSEF56|5|😀
B005I3C0UM|4|I'm still breaking them in so I can't give a long term review, but in the short term compared to wearing Doc Martens for years while riding....<br /><br />I find them to vent better and they seem to be getting more comfortable. I feel they're a little low for full ankle support and having gone from the Doc Marten &#34;Air Cushion&#34; sole to this much more firm lower sole I feel more of the vibrations going through my feet. They lack the ability to dampen in my opinion but it's obviously biased.
B000BUU5Z4|5|useful for RV
B00MMLIXPO|5|Works great
B00TQ07IOQ|5|very nice for the money
B005ETOVZM|5|Installed in my 1981 Chevy C20 Crew Cab as part of a project to fix the fuel tank selector system.  I have the unit connected to pull from the drivers side (main) tank as the primary, and the passenger side tank as the Aux.  Easy install, easy wiring (one wire is all it needs).  Buy a pair of fuel filters to install before the valve, to ensure no debris from the tanks can interfere with the valve.  Use Equus 7362 Fuel Level Gauge if you want to know the fuel level in your tank; this gauge works with the factory sending unit already in the tank. (I use 2 gauges so I know both tanks at all times because the truck isn't used often).
B000BOAZM8|5|great sevice
B00IPS4APU|5|Works great and is good for multiple use
B00FZU7BSY|5|works great
B009ANV81S|5|Does what I purchased it to do.
B0052SF0LO|4|Good product but it seems the sensitivity settings is not accurate.
B005KDOA3K|3|I like the Silverstar ultras better. These weren't not as white.
B0026RVU9A|5|This far exceeded my expectations. The colors stand out much more than I hoped for. Very happy with the product.
B00F6BHKWY|4|Wouldve gave it 5 stars but some of the corners would ride up when you sit down. Otherwise a good product
B000BZIPEW|5|Perfect fit for '04 Chevy Trailblazer and nice and quiet
B000GU1T8Q|5|I got these to replace my worn out stock reeds after one of the reeds broke. I wouldn't say these gave the bike more power, but it definitely made the power that is there feel better. These are a good upgrade over stock blaster reeds for the price. If your expecting wheelie popping performance from these reeds, youll be disappointed. But they will put some pep in your step and make your ride more fun.
B00M7D3EJC|4|worked
B002803SA4|5|Got fast, just as listed.
B002MQCY7C|5|They work great exactly as advertised.  You do not have to cut anything on your helmet to use them.  Very well designed.
B00C8E8Q02|5|super
B004130CVE|4|It Fit....<br /><br />Basically - That's it.<br /><br />A tad expensive for a piece of recycled plastic... - but, ever so much cheaper than ultra virgin original Japanese plastic.
B000FW61SI|5|Great!
B007YIZM22|3|The bearing fit just fine. Just a little more noisy than I would have liked it to be.
B00XQJXGEO|5|Really stands out and looks cool.
B00NQUSNIC|5|So far so good, these are a great match to the color of my truck. Better quality than the plastic OEM caps. They add a nice touch to the overall appearance.
B000BYD3UY|3|worked but I had to drill out the old mounting bracket , rebolt it and reuse it.  Quite a bit of work to make it useable.
B000276B2C|5|Great price.<br />Even cheaper than walmart
B0043063JU|5|It was better than expected!!
B001AY2WLU|4|The two main arms were kind of loose, so that they would swing down on their own while it was clipped to my keychain, but I fixed that by gently hammering the hinges and its been snug for weeks now.
B0042Z0E6E|5|Really great. Actually got terribly muddy during a storm and cleaned up neautifully
B004RAG6CU|5|Works great getting at the valves on my bike. Just what I needed.

B00NPPNKTU|5|these lights are awesome. they're super bright and work great when i need extra light reversing at night.
B000BUOSGG|5|Perfect for the sink in our vintage Airstream. Sturdy, and &#34; lip &#34; drains well into sink. Stores easily in the cabinet underneath.
B000C55ZT4|5|Bought these for my dad for Fathers Day at a fraction of what they would cost from the auto parts stores.  Just what he needed and I'm happy to get a deal!
B000CJ061C|5|If you have an electric fan to mount this does the trick.
B001C6JCA0|5|Exactly like the original! Thanks fit perfect
B000BQSIWK|5|charged up the battery in a short time then my old one, very nice unit
B00XV4EQ3O|4|Haven't installed yet, but they look like good quality.
B00CHD3URS|5|It was perfectly what I needed and very quick delivery, low price.
B00B2A1B14|5|Used this touch up paint  which includes clear coat, now I can hardly find the door ding.
B000VB2U9C|5|I ordered this radiator and installed it myself in a 2009 Chevy Malibu LTZ with the 3.6 V6 engine. It has been installed for over a month now (at the time of review) with no problems to report. As far as I can tell, it's a great product.<br /><br />Note: Just because I said &#34;installed it myself&#34; should not be taken as me saying it was easy. Newer cars are a pain to work on and this one was no different.
