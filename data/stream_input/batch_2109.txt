B0063GORYU|5.0|I think I am wearing my game out. Now when I play, the cards don't shovel any more, I get all kinds of garbage (i.e. all 2's or 10's, or any others of the same card.). what can I do? It's my favored, and I think I will have to find another good game.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Granted the FX are over the top, but more could have been spent on the story line. It was a good concept, but it was glazed over.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Pretty enjoyable but I was really surprised to be asked to pay 4.99 in the middle of the game.  It is a little too expensive. I would pay 1.99.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I adored season one of Downton Abbey, and season is just as wonderful!  Everyone I know is caught up with &#34;Downton Abbey Fever&#34; yet the vast majority of them are PAYING for the dvd's.  AMAZON PRIME offers them ALL for FREE!  What a bonus to what is already the 'deal of the century' with Amazon Prime - free shipping on all purchases and guaranteed two-day delivery!  I cannot tell you how much I love being a member of AMAZON PRIME.  Worth every penny!  XO

B008RV5K5E|3.0|The Dark Knight Returns is one of my all-time favorite comic stories, and I was hoping that the film would match its greatness. But as other reviewers have pointed out, much of what made the story great has been eliminated and background noise as been moved to the forefront.<br /><br />The TV news broadcasts, which have a place in the comic and do add depth to the story are overemphasized and slow the pace too much.<br /><br />All of Batman's inner dialogue, his reasoning for what he does (and doesn't do) are eliminated completely. When I first watched it, i thought I had a sound problem and that the channel carrying that dialogue had failed. After fiddling with the audio for a bit I had to accept that some of the best lines in the comic were just left out of the film.<br /><br />\\"This would be a good death... But not good enough.\\"<br />\\"There are seven working defenses from this position. Three of them disarm with minimal contact. Three of them kill. The other--hurts.\\"<br />\\"It was tough work, carrying 220 pounds of sociopath to the top of Gotham Towers -- the highest spot in the city. The scream alone is worth it.\\"<br /><br />These lines give us insight into the mind of Batman. Without them, the film is really pretty dull. Like a tracing of the Mona Lisa passed off as the real thing.
B002361MLA|5.0|This is a great book for those who are looking to get beyond where we are at now.  I knew there was more to this existence than what we experience currently and this book proves it.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|This book is for a younger age group so I did not appreciate it like the younger croud definitely would. It is well done but not not for me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I found this to be a satisfying end to the trilogy. I waited a few weeks between finishing the 2nd book and starting this one because after reading other reviews, I wanted to put off the disappointment I expected to feel. I was happily surprised to enjoy the book as a story on its own, and to feel it completed the trilogy well. I think reviewers who weren't happy with this book were looking for a happily ever after ending that would not have fit in with the grittiness of the previous books. Is it realistic to expect the characters to compete in The Hunger Games twice and to emerge as the same people they were before? I appreciated reading about them as they learned to survive in the new normal.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very additive.  However occasionally when I am playing the screen will glitch a little.  I don't believe that it is just my kindle. I have noticed the same problem with other kindles.  Otherwise the game is a great game and I highly recommend it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a soap opera but it's interesting, humorous and beautifully filmed with great attention to detail.  The ensemble cast is really good.  You will get hooked.
0345803493|5.0|I ready every night before I sleep and this was so much fun, exciting, sexy and really great characters, very well done.

B000068FY0|5.0|This 1974 masterpiece of an album by Supertramp features the band at their creative peak, with a fusion of progressive rock, pop, straight rock, and what they more or less invented, \\"art rock.\\" The songs are of a sophisticated nature, with pianos and more complex arrangements that somehow gain traction and really resonate. That told, this album is by far their most talented effort. However, five years later, they would release another album to critical acclaim, 1979's Breakfast in America, which is considered by the masses to be their best album. I love Breakfast in America, but I don't consider it to be their best work. Crime of the Century is their best, because it doesn't relinquish a thing; these guys needed a hit, but didn't give up their roots in the process. The title track is my favorite on this album, and depicts everything that is good about this band, creatively and musically. SCHOOL is stellar, too, with its great keyboard work. HIDE IN YOUR SHELL is great as well, with a nice pop melody. I recommend this album for those with eclectic taste in rock. You won't be disappointed. 10/10
B0084670FU|5.0|This was an interesting movie.  It took me some time to link all the plots together. It was one of those films that you have to watch a second time to actually understand what was happening.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I love dark movies, or those with a dark tone to them. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a PG movie that manages to deliver dark elements throughout while not compromising its rating. The result is a balanced film that reaches deep into the senses and psyche. The whole school of wizardry thing really captivates, and the story is best told through the deep British accents that were used. If I have one criticism of this film, it would be the length. At over two and a half hours, it's a tad lengthy, especially when there's some overindulgence in the length of some scenes. A two hour movie probably would've been better, though I'm not complaining too much. This film sets the stage for the rest of the series; it's a series that has at least one movie that's sure to appeal to someone. A good opening act that I recommend.
B0088T3B0G|5.0|If you haven't ever seen The Usual Suspects, you're missing one of the best films of the past 20 years! Entertaining with a twist ending that will leave you with a smile.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I watch the Harry Potter movies several times a year.  This is an absolutely perfect collection!  There are no frills to this set--it is just the discs in a single plain DVD case.  It is perfect for just watching all 8 movies and nothing else.  I highly recommend you get this for the HP lover in your life!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book is difficult to read as it is so emotionally moving. I couldn't stop reading but I didn't like it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I purchased this book because it was cheap (like most people probably do). I felt bad; I'd pay full cover price for it after reading it. I'm going to give it 5/5 stars because it was engaging, gripping, and was humbling. To start, there's a sense of humour here that is really needed to cope with the conditions of Mars. There are many chapters where you expect the book to turn sour (and many that do). However, our hero perseveres with his brand of laughing off the dangers and will to survive. I really enjoyed this novel because there are no crazy alien life forms to contend with - just the reality of what it would be like to survive on Mars. There isn't a dull moment through the adventure. Give it a read.
B00004ZD69|4.0|A studio capture of material which is also available in a number of live contexts.<br />The Gathering Storm is especially effective, with it's sinking titanic lietmotif.<br />Powerful stuff.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I loved this movie.  Without giving away too much, I call this a rare jewel of a film because, it is one of the most heart pounding thrillers in years, and contains almost no action.  How did the filmmakers of 'Argo' achieve this?  A good question.  This is a very rare feat indeed.<br /><br />Credit must go to Ben Affleck of course.  What a Director this fellow is.  He manages to draw the viewer into a situation where the viewer feels the helplessness of the individuals, and pulls them into the question of whether these people will escape, never once offering any suggestion of whether they will.  It isn't easy to craft a film where the viewer is forced to feel sympathy with the subjects of the film in question - Ben Affleck ensures we live every moment with these people.<br /><br />I said in the subject title of this film this is one of the best thrillers in years.  I say this because, at roughly the halfway mark of this movie, the tension starts, and I felt my heart thumping out of my chest ; this continued for the remainder of the film, through to the movie's staggering climax.  1 hour!  I can't recall a recent thriller that has held such tension at such high levels, for such a large portion of the movie.  Normally your typical film, even your great ones, have the character development, and middle section, and (if they're lucky), a great climax.  'Argo' quickly tells us the story as development, to draw us in, and then rapidly focuses straight on the subjects of the film in question and offers the viewer the question (without any answers) of 'how can they escape?'<br /><br />The film is also quite funny.  John Goodman and Alan Arkin have some great dialogue and are natural comedians.  Those scenes are always with just the right amount of 'funny' though - not to distract us from the situation the subjects of the film find themselves in.<br /><br />I haven't seen \\"Lincoln\\" yet but, it would be a just result if Argo took away the Best Picture Oscar (if 'Lincoln' doesn't).  I say this because the other nominees, while great, are just films that you see made any given year - a good drama here and there.  I think Argo deserves the nod because it achieves something that hasn't been seen in years - a heart pounding thriller that manages this with no action.  Such a rare commodity, and as such, should be awarded the highest of accolades I believe.  I rest my qualification of this latter statement though until I see \\"Lincoln\\" which, I'm catching this week =).  If you only see one of the Oscar's Best Picture nominees though, make it Argo.  It is a rare thriller - one of the best in years.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|The action is non-stop and a good movie to watch any time.<br /><br />I would recommend it to my friends but as an action movie only.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|I walked into Zero Dark Thirty expecting a film with the heart pounding excitement of The Hurt Locker.  This film is marketed as a thriller but, it really is anything but.  Whilst I thought the final 20 minutes was clever filmmaking, the pace of the remainder of this 2.5 hour film is very dull, with almost no climatic moments.  The so called tense 'torture' scenes were just boring.  When the film started and we get underway with the story development, after an hour I remember thinking to myself 'okay.. now that the character development is complete, this will start ramping up, getting tense and heart pounding.' Er.. no.  Another one hour of arguing between the lead actress and a bunch of co-workers follows.  Sheesh.  Now, before you say I just like slam bam b-grade action movies, some of this year's best films have been slower moving dialogue driven films.  Take 'Argo' and 'Django Unchained' - fascinating dialogue driven movies, supported by great screenplays.  In Zero Dark Thirty the dialogue is just uninteresting and lacking any thrill.  In Zero Dark Thirty we get 2 hours of very slow and dull material, and then the staple 20 minute resolution.  Even the finale was not even the slightest bit thrilling.  The camera work was very good at capturing the mood (loved the handicam effect) but, there was no thrilling climax that great movies have.  The hunt for the fugitive was very matter of fact, what we know happens gets done in a very ho hum fashion, and the credits immediately roll.  What?  That was it?  That was an Oscar Best Picture front runner?  Please.  Ebert was spot-on with his review of this one.  If there's any justice, the white knuckled thriller Argo will get the nod this year -  a great example of a rare film that with almost no action present, creates a heart pounding movie simply from incredibly tense dialogue and situations.  (Although, I haven't seen the other favourite 'Lincoln' yet.)  As for Zero Dark Thirty, wait for it on dvd and rent it if you feel you absolutely must see it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love Downton Abbey!  The acting, scenery, setting, interactions, relationships, wardrobe - all superb!  Watch it and you will love it too.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|For a prequel, this wasn't as bad as others would have you believe. And I would have liked it more if there hadn't been one flaw that annoyed me. The flamethrowers NEVER ran out of fuel. In real life, they would run out after a few brief firings. Here. they fired them frequently, and often for long sustained bursts. Re-fueling them would take a while and need to be done by someone trained in fueling and pressurizing the units.
B0054S6N04|5.0|Linda Howard's books are always great.  Mr. Perfect is definitely one of the top book she has written. I'd recommend any of her books.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I look up things the preacher says and take notes and have a personnel bible to work on my own studies with...
B008SVS3FC|4.0|It's hard to beat some of John Hiatt's earlier recordings....  Bring the Family is one of my favorites-  considering the band on that one....  and the production.  I like a down to earth simple sound-  like a live band-  and this is another great band to back his songs...
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We rented it for our 3 year old granddaughter, it didn't hold her interest but it did ours. Worth watching.
B005FLX1HS|4.0|I became aware of Skrillex because his music is used for background in some extreme sports videos-  I remember a Shawn White half pipe run that featured a track-  and it was a great fit.....<br /><br />never been to a rave myself,  or taken E-  but I liked this CD more than I expected,  even without the X sports connection.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are the one featuring the Doors,  and Bangarang-
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|Somehow they managed to make time fly as you sit watching a guy trying to get his arm out from under a rock. I would highly recommend this movie.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|With so many other wonderful an in depth reviews on this movie I'll just admit im posting this one as a push for high marks and ill admit that.<br /><br />The color scheme on this movie is top notch with the palette jumping out at you.  You dont often notice this with movies so that is definitely saying something here.  The cast is stellar and I never really noticed the acting. You're not going to feel like you're watching a movie despite the intricate plot lines.<br /><br />Another great part of this movie is the number of quotes you'll find yourself carrying with you.  Devito puts up a show stealing performance and so do so many of the other actors.<br /><br />This is one of my top 5 favorites and I think you should do yourself a favor and get this video.
B007W1BLN0|1.0|A very well made movie about a troubled young man who did an ultimately stupid thing for no good reason. Why his story is glorified makes no sense. It's a sad tale. That's all.
B008Y6TE5O|4.0|It was funny and thought provoking  Acting was ok the stunts were good It was good to see Arnold in a different kind of role
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This was a family favorite growing up.  In HD it is great. Kids love it too, good thing this is not a VHS tape, the amount of times the kids have watched it the tape would have been worn through.  Don't miss this classic.
0142501123|5.0|Great Halloween book for the classroom. I love rhyming books. Fun for the kids. A nice addition to your classroom library.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Ok,  I watched this last night.  Was it an example of one of Denzel Washington's best parts?  No, but it was a fine job he did with the part.  Now many reviewers are not happy at all with what this movie, I suppose because the trailer leads one to believe it's an action packed movie and just that.  Well, there was the plane sequence and it was lively alright.  But the movie turns out really not to be about landing a plane expertly at all.  It's focus is about drug and alcohol addiction and how it affects your life and the ends people will go to to maintain an appearance of a normal life, and some pull it off pretty darn well, as was the case here.  I was not mad or bothered by the fact that the movie took a different turn than I expected.  Fact is, anymore, I don't really have an expectation that I know what a movie is going to be about, as trailers are really good at fooling you and leading you on.  So, if I like the leading actor or actress, and I like the general type of movie, (action,  adventure, etc)  then I roll the dice once in a while.<br />As far as getting upset about the nudity in this picture,  all I can say is where there are drugs, alcohol, and a general out of control lifestyle, there is going to be sex.  It was not overly focused on, in my opinion,  that's just the real world, why sugar coat it.  I will say, I like the fact that in the end, the pilot confesses that he was drunk and had been for a long time, and made the decision to tell the truth instead of having it end with a slick lie and sliding out of it.  Some would probably have preferred that ending, and in reality it would be possible.  Well I don't want to go on and wax philosophical about all of this, but it was an Ok movie and that's it.
0736092269|5.0|this is a great book for starters and advance alike lots of pictures and description of 100's of exercises a must have for the at home trainer.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoyed this free version more than others I have tried.  The grahpics are fun and the navigation is easy.  My complaint is that I have not been able to turn off the annoying sounds that occur with each pair that is matched.
1476712042|5.0|I loved this book. Could not put it down majority of the time.  I can not wait for Walking Disaster to come.out.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|We watched this as a family movie night. All of our kids play basketball and found this movie to be very uplifting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game, provides hours of fun enjoyable entertainment. would highly recommended this game to new kindle users
B00821PCJS|5.0|this is a great apocalypse story. It doesn't matter whether we're talking about nuclear war, zombies or aliens, the theme is the same. Good people and bad people trying to find their way in a world with out structure and systems. Falling Skies is mildly corny sometimes but it makes up for it with some great scenes and dialogue. For the most part, it is a realistic depiction of guerilla warfare and survival. The only glaring problem with the series is the openness with which the group travels at night by convoy. This would be very easy to detect by the so-called superior beings. I enjoyed this series very much and can't wait for Season 3.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|There are three episodes, in my opinion, that require a five star rating be given to this season.  1. Evolution- Worf turns into a beast and Troi turns into an amphibian; 2. Yesterday's Enterprise- another version of the enterprise, both C and D; 3. Best of Both Worlds, Part I- possibly the greatest TNG episode of all time.<br /><br />Edit:  Evolution involves nanites - i was wrong and someone caught it.  sorry for the star trek deception.  Fortunately for me, I like that episode as well.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Slow moving and could easily guess what was happening next. The sex was used to try and keep you interested, but that soon got old also.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|Fistful of Datas is a great episode.  Not just one Data - a FISTFUL of datas.  Keeping the tradition of some really beautiful guest stars, True Q has Olivia D'Abo in it as a Q continuum member.  There are also some great two-part episodes: Chain of Command and Birthright.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I don't understand all the bated reviews. I thought it was very helpful and good. It wouldn't open a few times,  but it 's worth it ...
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Good read. Very well delivered. Captivate  my attention from the very beginning. I wish there was different ending<br /> Otherwise good book
B007GE2H3G|4.0|It's a animated movie, the plot is quite simple, and it's rather enjoyable. Though not quite my cup of tea. I watched the whole thing and didn't feel like I wasted my time, however if you are watching it as a grown-up movie, I would recommend something else. It's probably a great movie to watch with children.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. At times I was laughing till I cried and was very touched by other parts. I would definitely recommend this book!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I am an elementary school teacher and I read this book because I have seen so many students reading it.  The book is engaging right from the beginning and an exciting story.  The children reading this book will be able to relate to the characters and the various dilemmas they encounter.  In addition, they should be able to determine right away whether or not they will enjoy the book.  Finally, although the hero is a boy, there are enough female character to attract readers of both sexes.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is so good. When you finish the season finale, you need to immediately start the next season. Bravo PBS Bravo!
B007M45PMU|4.0|There are more than a few good songs on this disc.  I like Stubborn Love better than the Ho Hey song that is played on the radio.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|One of the greatest &#34;cult&#34; movies of all time!  Totally mismarketed for its initial run in theaters, this film is the stuff of legend.  It packs as much punch-drunk guilty-pleasure train-wreck can't-wipe-the-goofy-grin-off-your-face o-m-f-g subversive fun as any Tarantino movie.  Ask your friends.  If they know, they will give you a wicked little smile, and say, &#34;Oh, yeah&#34;, as they suddenly flash back to their favorite scenes.  An all-time classic!
B0094K20FK|4.0|Anything with Star Trek in front of it would have to watch it from start to finish and Ricardo is a great villain in this one. Like the way they through in the lead-in for the next sequel at the end.
B0000844M8|5.0|I loved this film just as much as I did when I first watched it as a young girl. I even showed it to a group of teenagers and they were completely captivated.
B008ROZAQU|4.0|Kind of funny seeing my favorite movie star in something besides cowboy boots and wearing a low slung six gun.<br />Like Red Buttons too so that was a plus.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Overall, this series is well made.  Noah Wiley does a good job and the supporting characters are good as well.  I have enjoyed this series.
1596680199|4.0|Good pictures and instructions fill this book.  I've gotten some good ideas from it.  Now if I just had time to bead!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is easy, fun,  addictive. One of my favorite hidden picture games. I definetly would recommend it for anyone.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My seven year old granddaughter wanted this game so as long as it was free I downloaded it.  She sits for long periods of free time and plays and it builds a lot of self confidence for her.  I like that!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Where everything & nothing happens all at once!!  The costumes, scenery, spot on acting and storylines keep you coming back for more. My boyfriend & I watched Season 1 & 2 and caught up on Season 3 within a couple of weeks....
B004X4QVSO|1.0|Just fast forward through the film to the action sequences. The plot is thin and the action is as expected. Nothing new here.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read. Couldn't put it down. I'm required to put more words down than i need so I am typing this.
B002KGEORM|5.0|this is my favorite show.. i never miss it...i even changed satelite providers when it was in jeoparty of being left off schedule....
B008PZ69T8|5.0|If you haven't made love with classical music playing in the background, you haven't experienced the sensuous  rhapsodies inherent in this magical pairing. This CD offers musical peaks, valleys, and plains with all the straining effort it takes to achieve the glories for those who scale the notes.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was totally awesome. I especially love the part when Percy and annabeth are kissing and then they are interrupted. I love their relationship. Can't wait until the next books.(definitely the best in the series).
B004DM0UII|3.0|The app is decent enough and does what it should. I am only writing this review because of the incessant nag screen. Every time I launch app it nags me to review. I would not purchase for this reason.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game SOOOOOOO much. I'd recommend this to anyone who would randomly ask &quot;Should I or should I not buy temple run?&quot; I'd say &quot; Please buy it. It's an awesome game! You'll luv it.&quot; I love this game.
B00821OX98|5.0|I started watching a lot of TV the last few years while I excercise, purchasing many TV series on DVD, mostly Sci Fi and some supernatural, both old and recent.  Except for classics like Farscape and Babylon 5, this is the best series I watched.  Definitely the best of the recent series (last few years).  I can't wait for Season 3, if there will be one.  I am also a proud subscriber of Netflix and Amazon Prime and won't be buying many more TV series on DVD anymore.<br /><br />As far as details of the series, excellent acting and decent special effects.  There is a purpose for everyone in the aftermath of the alien invasion, even lawyers.  (Figure this out when they end up in Charleston).  Whew, I thought I would have no purpose after a global catastrophe.  The acting is of course what does it.  It is so good I watched the entire series over two weekends.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this version.  It's unique and very fun.  I am addicted and so is my husband. It is great!
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Can't stop listening to it.. Very intelligent twist of words and timing on the bands part. Clean, excellent. -Roy M
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a wonderful app.  Very easy to pull up and get up to date hourly information that's useful and comes in handy daily
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Ok, for the evening of movie watching.<br />A bit of unrealistic flying upside down.<br />Not one for the young kids a little to sexy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the graphics! This is the closest I'll ever get to owning a horse lol<br />I'm having fun doing competitions :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved it.  I just started watching this series at the recommendation of friends.  Well worth it and I can't wait to watch season 3.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app has been quite accurate for my area.  I check it many times a day during the winter months.
B000FCKIFU|2.0|This book was hard to follow initially.  Picked up almost half way through and enjoyed the ending.  Hope to read more.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show has plenty of action and pretty good acting. It is not a show you want to watch before going to bed.  It does have some aspects that don't make sense, but it is Hollywood. Like why don't walkers eat each other, why is it so easy for Dayrl to pull his crossbow bolts out of the dead, and how come Hershel didn't get an infection after losing his leg?  I know it is just a make believe show.
1451695195|1.0|I found the account of heaven to be too superficial to be believed as an NDE. He was loved unconditionally - well isn't that what we learn in religion class in 1st grade, that God loves us unconditionally?  Much of the book was devoted to people's accounts of when he was in the hospital and his scientific learnings in an attempt to justify the so-called NDE. It was probably just a dream he had.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was an amazing book!!!! It had me on the edge of my seat at some parts and had me in tears at others. I definitely recommend this book to everyone.
0375507256|5.0|I read this book after the 2012 movie came out and I was blown away. I thought I knew what to expect since the book and the movie tell two very different stories; I felt like the book was a little more realistic - the movie sort of romanticized the novel. However, this is an amazing read. One of the reviews was very accurate: &#34;Mitchel's courage makes him worthy of recognition on both sides of the Atlantic.&#34; This man has amazing talent, foresignt and the uncanny ability to switch from one genre to another without ever faltering!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The new one is okay. Same game different location. The graphics are better, and it is easier to unlock upgrades and characters.
B004JN1CW4|2.0|This trilogy started wonderfully and ended quite boring. The story was ok. The third book was dragged it longer than necessary.
B005EGXNLS|3.0|This was not a particularly easy read since it's based on early English peoples and names and places are difficult to track. I needed a &#34;cheat sheet.&#34;
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I flew through this book. Great characters who act realistically.  Highly entertaining writing. Believe all the great reviews. And only 5 bucks!
B0015ZNNEE|5.0|While this recording is, as stated above, beautiful I must state here that I had numeral problems trying to install it in my iTunes library, ultimately failing. While the company producing this CD did try to help their free download turned out to be all out of order of the actual opera.  They are now offering me a free download of something else which I will try but in the meantime I had to purchase a downloaded version form Amazon to get it installed in my iTunes library.  Specifically the problem with the CD purchase was that while the first of the two CDs intalled just fine the second part of the opera on the 2nd CD was not even recognized as a useable disc! although it played fine on my stereo.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|I loved this movie, Think I would watch it again if I had the chance.  I don't get much time to watch movies but it turned out to be a thriller.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Irreverent without being mean-spirited. I love that ultimately, it is about hope and, different species notwithstanding, we are more alike than we are different.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I like it it but it is so much like temple . I wish game can be unique. . Yes I know that it has a different theme.  Also this is like angry granny. People need to be weird to succeed in me opinion.!!!
0979019710|5.0|I have been doing the Miracle Morning for a little over a month now and it has truly changed my life. I wake up at 5am everyday, exercise, eat right and get things done! I have already lost 10 lbs. and know I will reach my goal weight. This book works for me because everything is spelled out for you. You follow Hal's lead and then modify it to fit your own situation. I know it has me motivated to become a better version of myself.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great book. I like Mitch Rapp. The experiences of his character are always<br />intriguing. Vince Flynn is a ver y descriptive author.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This is on our top ten list of fabulous movies. Gregory Peck is outstanding as usual, and Christopher Plummer is excellent. The ending is so incredible...but I won't reveal it! :-)  Truly a great story of Christian forgiveness and loving one's enemies, as Christ taught. I highly recommend this movie!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series is one of the best dramas we have ever watched...and getting this UK version before the US version was great!
B004R0WUMA|3.0|It has it's chilling moments but I didn't really find it scary, though it was better than the first movie.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Tell u wht love this mofo game hehe u guys did good hehe so much bc u not human by
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I started with the free version but it wasn't long before I exceeded the upload limit. I'm now paying $5.00 per month for a premium account. It's probably the best $5.00 I spend each month. I have Evernote on all my devices; Kindle Fire, HTC Evo, 2 desktop computers, and 1 one laptop. And of course, the Web version is always available.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|A great family film. We watched it with our 11 year old and she enjoyed it as much as we did.  Sure, there were a few moments, but overall good!
B00821OX98|2.0|Falling Skies is entertaining, but only at a juvenile level. It's mostly a mixed bag of too many things we've seen too many times before. Here is the recipe: take a healthy dose of smaltz, throw in some corn, pepper it with lots of hammy acting, sprinkle in a rather silly and unbelievable storyline, add an overly, melodramatic musical score for dressing, and then toss it all together in a relatively well done apocalyptic setting, and you've got a good idea of the flavor (and smell) of Falling Skies. The first couple of episodes weren't too hard to watch, but as with most of these series it kind of degenerates as it goes. Too bad! Seemed like it was an idea with a lot of potential.
B009CGYO0K|4.0|This book is pretty funny and cute! I especially love the parts about belly rubs and kittens, I'm pretty sure my cat has done almost, if not all, of these things at one point. I've often wondered if she was making plans to kill me before, but now I'm convinced that is exactly what she is doing.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I enjoyed the story very much.  It has unique style of revisiting historic events from a man's view with a lot of twists and turns.  The story was very unpredictable and quietly exciting...
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really did like this book. I didn't want to put it down. This is a wonderful book to read.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Edge of your seat TV.  One of the most enjoyed TV series ever viewed.  Recommend for any Sci-Fi mystery fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This thought provoking, well written young adult page turner will leave you wanting more.  It should be required reading for everyone 14 and over.  Well written, thought provocking and your find yourself cheering and crying and questioning.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's the best!  I don't know of any other show that is as riveting as Downton Abbey is right now.
B0018RC7QE|2.0|I can't support a storyline that encourages marital infidelity! Only watched about the first 20 minutes and I'd seen enough
B0093ST02E|3.0|Terrific cast plagued with a shallow script, too little material to make a feature film, and inept directing. Sara Polley stretched each scene to the edge of tedium.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|He has Most of my ideas about how to eat right already incorporated and the on more. He has refined my strategy with very plausible argument which are easy to follow and agree with. Just note sure that I am as obsessed with discipline as the author is?
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Another great Connelly book! Mickey Haller, even with several obstacles, does a great job for his client. Great ending! Don't miss it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Beautifully written!  Answers all your questions.  Excellent end to a brilliant and thought provoking trilogy.  While the trilogy is listed as young adult, the seris is so well written and thoughtfully put together, adults will find it to be an engaging page turner that is difficult to put down.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|i love playing against the computer, you can even choose the level of difficulty. its a great app and id recommend it to anyone who likes to play chess
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Unique subject matter, heartfelt, touching film about a disabled man who hires a sex therapist at age 38 to help him realize his sexuality.  I liked it more than I thought I would.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|All the movies are great. I have all the books, but prefer the movies. I just love the way Harry Potter has grown up.
B008M7JODC|5.0|Carrying on the proud legacy of the X-Files, this show is yet another classic that was underappreciated by Fox Network...
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Michael Connelly at his best! Loe both the Harry Bosch and Micky Haller series. Lots of action and great character development. Wonderful reading!
B003O86FMW|5.0|You can read the first book without reading the others, but once you read this one, you have to read the final book.  Again a well written page turner, but this one leaves you wanting more!
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|The source-material for this film is fascinating: the rescue of six trapped Embassy staff, who were holed up in the Canadian Embassy in Tehran in 1979, through the efforts of a CIA agent.  The action sequences are extremely well handled, with a nicely judged opening to the film, building up to a tense climax as the hostages are successfully extricated, despite the attentions of the Iranian military. However the film's effect is reduced somewhat by sentimental plot-lines (the sequences involving Affleck's family are spurious, to say the least), plus an orientalist perspective that continues to portray all members of Muslim nations as fanatics or religious obsessives. The sequence taking place in the Blue Mosque in Istanbul is a good example of this. Affleck directs well, but perhaps remains a little colorless in the central role. Worth watching, but could have been better.
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|I knew the critics did not like this movie, I had some interest in seeing it only because of the Director. I can now honestly say the only value it has to me is now i can answer the question if it is ever asked of me, \\"What is the WORST movie ever directed by David Cronenberg\\"? I can deal with abstract views ,or so I previously thought, I enjoy sci fi movies, usually if you cant really \\"get\\" the abstract ideas,the film will be visually appealing at least. This movie is a disturbing waste of time because it is hard to understand what the characters are talking about, or care what the point is, and the ending is the biggest waste of all. I honestly dont even understand why any mainstream players would want to be involved in this, if there actually was a statement involved, it certainly didn't hit home with me : (
B0099114WO|5.0|I'm sure this movie is NOT for everyone but I enjoyed it so much that I've already watched it twice during the 4 days I received it. While some might find it dull, I love character-driven stories that are as well written as this. It was sort of offered as a comedy and it is but there is a deeper message delivered. To me, Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones do NOT disappoint. They both deliver a wonderful performance.  I've noticed some have said this was embarrassing to watch . . . then what do you think marriage is about? I would especially recommend this to middle aged couples that are trying to re-connect and really discover what intimacy is really supposed to be . . . not just sex. Well done.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|One of the best Rebus novels; Rebus only gets more emotionally complex with age and Rankin's emotional connection to the character only gets stronger. As usual Rankin's strongest point is perhaps not his plotting, but his masterful writing. Such a pleasure to read good writing, and Rankin doesn't fail to deliver here.
B00008HCCF|5.0|Great Music performed by an amazing artist. This DVD is a must have. When it's playing you will feel as comfortable as a lazy Sunday in your favorite jeans. Buy It!
B009NXV2RK|5.0|This book did not disappoint. It had the same high level of writing I have come to expect from Tom Clancy, with great twists and story line and plenty of action to keep me on the edge of my seat, turning the pages.
B009AMANBA|4.0|In many ways Spielberg's LINCOLN is an old-fashioned film, portraying the central character (Daniel Day-Lewis) as a strong, yet fair personality who overcomes all resistance to pass the amendment ending slavery in the United States. Day-Lewis is just wonderful in the role, his quiet air of authority contrasting starkly with many of the members of the House of Representatives, who let their hearts rule their heads on most occasions.  Tommy Lee Jones provides admirable support as Stevens, the pro-Abolitionist who is nonetheless reluctant to support Lincoln in his efforts.  Beautifully photographed, with atmospheric music by John Williams, this film is long (140 minutes)m, but well worth the effort. Interestingly, I think that its contemporary message is an important one, as Lincoln uses his political skills to overcome resistance to his amendment and eventually wins the vote.  Would that Barack Obama could do the same in implementing his government policies in his second term of office.  Perhaps he should follow Lincoln's example.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I can't stop playing. My daughter keeps begging me to share lol. Wish I had more peanuts! This is better than some of those other animal care games out there.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|This movie is absolutely the best for any Tim Curry or Horror Fan. Love Halloween as much as anyone else? Prove it with a watching of RHPS. If you see this film, see the show live at a venue near you. It's just as good!
B00AAKZPUK|2.0|The first 10 minutes were fast-paced and exciting, but it was downhill after that. The story dragged on and with tighter editing, at least 30 minutes could have been cut and the film would have been much better.<br /><br />The one-night stand with Faye Dunaway was not believable and didn't advance the plot, and even the action scenes were flat. The script was pretty bad, too. At one point, when Dunaway is complaining to Redford about how badly he has treated her, he says &#34;At least I haven't raped you,&#34; and she replies &#34;The night is still young.&#34;<br /><br />I saw this film 10 or 15 years ago and it seemed a lot better then than it did this time.
B00428CPUY|4.0|I bought this DVD for the Tedeschi Trucks, Warren Haynes and Joe Bonamassa material. These three acts alone make this DVD worth having. Everything else is just a bonus. In my opinion, some of the artists don't really fit with the &#34;guitar festival&#34; theme and shouldn't have been included to make room for additional performances from others. Overall the quality of this DVD is excellent, but Bill Murray will end up getting on your nerves.
B008Q09K2U|4.0|A very realistic portrayal of the real life considerations someone in intelligence community must have to deal with I would imagine. The dry wit of the main character makes this a very enjoyable book to read, to the point where I cracked up laughing a few times. Since the actual plot takes a while to get going and while the action scenes are intense, without the humour of the main character I don't know if I would have continued reading to the end.
B00005Y443|5.0|It's truly a jazz classic . . . an adaption of Rodrigo's &#34;Concierto de Aranjuez.&#34;  Paul Desmond and Chet Baker are featured with guitarist, Hall.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Clasic comic book series brought too life , excucuted flawlessly. Leaves you wanting more. I cannot wait for a sequel. Just the right amount of action and humour.
B0051SDM5Q|4.0|great read. very educational and full of great advice. i would suggest this book to anyone who is looking for negotiation techniques
B007EECSFA|4.0|I thought the Secret Keeper was a little slow through the middle but the end was well worth the wait.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is one of the best Green Day albums and one of my favorites too. I have always wanted this album ever since it came out and not until recently i got it and besides boulevard of broken dreams my favorite songs on here are jesus of suburbia (mainly city of the damned and i dont care), Holiday, and Give me novacaine. The only bad thing about this album is that it has an ending i dont want it to stop. Thats why fortunately there is a replay button :)
B00957T6X6|5.0|This series was recommended to me by several friends, so I figured I would download the sample onto my Kindle. It was fantastic, so I purchased the whole set. I'm on the third book right now and still can't put it down!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|This will probably be well received by someone in Jr. High.  Even then, it is more like a comic book than a real novel.
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|Have not used it enough to know for sure but seems  easy with different areas to be add most.ressed and better than
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Not based on government conspiracy yet has many of the same qualities that X-Files had when it first came out.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have read other &#34;life after life&#34; books in the past. This has a decidedly different feel to it because of the author's viewpoint as a man of science who was, in spite of his Christian cultural trappings, essentially a skeptic. His own experience blew away his skepticism, but nevertheless, his analytic turn of mind was with him throughout and he came away with an unusual, for the genre, ability to remember detail, and then to analyze and disarm his opponents' (skeptics, like he used to be) objections. A lot of the book is in fact a list of possible alternative  explanations scientists put forth to explain such phenomena and why he thinks these explanations don't work when held up against the light of his own experience. Fascinating!
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I love this season things are getting more and more complicated. And i bought the 1912 episode because of Damon's terrible humor. &#34; A chipmuck asked me my name today, I told him it was joe, that lie.. will haunt me.. forever.&#34; haha
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|What I love about this dictionary is the fact that it pronounces the words which I find is a great help for me.
B005NJU8PA|2.0|There were some really positive themes in the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the book, such that I thougjt it would be really beneficial for a young relative struggling through his first year of college. But the book got more and more bizarre , as to themes, and the obsenities became more numorous. I can only recommend part of this book,
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Pleasantly surprised by this movie the first time I saw it.  Unlike some movies, I hadn't seen tons of previews that gave away the story line and all the big scenes.  Can't think of anything I didn't like about it.  The characters are great and stick with you.  It might not appeal to very young children, but it does to this adult.  Maybe I'm just immature.  : )
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is amazing.  even if you haven't played the first one you can pick this one up and learn it fairly quick.  I play this on my Nexsus 7 and the graphics are so crisp.  This is a must download.
B00ANGICRE|4.0|Expectedly slow-moving but unexceptionally moving and emotional. No powerhouse performances from John Hawkes or Helen Hunt but their consistent and deeply heartfelt conversations make this a different kind of romance. John Hawkes as the bedridden poet Mark O'Brien is vulnerable and precarious, evoking a sense of teenage innocence as he revels in the therapy sessions and speaks of them with newfound wonder. Helen Hunt, gentle and persuasive, is bent on helping the man while subconsciously falling for his  tenderness and naivety.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I almost stopped reading this book after the first few pages. But because I already bought it and wanted to finish the series. I stuck through it and finished this terrible book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|very good book only 2/3 way through if but its a great book like all of Pattersons books love it so far.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is very fun and exciting. I recommend it anyone especially if you have ever had horses. I find it very realistic.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Made me blush, but couldn't put the book down.  Had to get the other 2 books as soon as I finished the one I was done with.
B00358ESI4|5.0|Having been a combat Marine in 1968, I found this movie to be one of the best. It very closly depicted how it really was.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Short but sweet lttle book on how to overcome being shy and strike up a conversation with anyone.  Most of these ideas are just common sense, but its a good review, especially if you're naturally shy.  I give the book four stars because it was FREE and is a good reference to look at before going into social situations.
1616550414|5.0|I'm still reading through this book myself, but it is really cool to see lots of concept art, including concepts that didn't make it into the games.  This book also contains a Chronology of Hyrule, showing the official chronology of the games.  It's an interesting read.<br /><br />The book has loads of pictures in it with sturdy smooth pages and a hard cover.  There is a bonus section at the end that contains a manga too.<br /><br />I'm very much enjoying this book and its a very interesting read for any Zelda fan!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|its the best game I've ever played better than brothers in arms and crime city. and ice age has nothing on this game.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I liked the movie. It was funny, had a good story line and was entertaining with several good one-liners. Good for kids to watch.
0807014273|3.0|Quite an experience but the book is too centered in the psychological aspects---more atuned for psychologists than for the general readership
B007SGM084|5.0|Fraction of the price from purchasing separately.  Read all 3 in a week. Amazing!!!!!!! Super sect and steamy. Lady smug at it's finest
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|An amazingly real and harrowing performance by one of the best actors currently working. Well worth the cost and time. You will be happy you saw this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is really fun...its kind of like temple run but i like subway surfers so much better...you jump and run on top of trains and there are mystery boxes you also travel to different places.....you should get! <3
B007DIQAXI|5.0|Great album! it's a most buy! support the indie scene and buy vinyls stop downloading and keep buying to help our small music scene to keep putting out good real music.
B007G5K066|5.0|I have seen both the original and the remake of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and will say that both are excellent, both are 5 stars, but one was a 6 episode mini-series and the other a feature film.  I suspect that the REAL reason others have not rated the remake higher is because they also have seen them both and liked the original better.  The remake has better actors, high quality performances and a story line that is easy to follow and characters that have no trouble getting their point across.<br /><br />It is a tough comparison for those of you that think they are comparing apples to apples when in this case that cannot be. It is much easier to gain and keep any audience when you have 180 minutes of a mini-series with which to work. The remake has one chance to capture the audience.but then you must have an objective audience to get a fair rating.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Loved the free download , would highly recommend trying out the next adventure .<br />May be  tempted to buy this one.ad entire, mystery,and hidden object all in one.<br />These are my favorite kind of game.
8866130923|5.0|I find this notebook efficient , the corect size adaptable to keep notes next to agenda....have been purachasing it for several years...the yellow defines it easily....of all agenda books this works best for me....I only wish that Amazon discounted it for if one signs on to Moleskine the item is the same price...the only advantage is that Amazon picks up the delivery charge if you make it a point of sale.
B00448SE4S|3.0|The movie was all around decent but if you got the time, watch it. This for me is a watch once and then never again or maybe even a two timer but that is kind of pushing it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks.  Nice love story with some exciting mystery. His books are always enjoyable reading and at a fast pace.  Hard to put down once you start to read it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is such a fun and addictive game to play when you have a few minutes of downtime and need something mindless to do.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A friend introduced me to season  and I I was hooked.  Using my Prime account I did a Downton Abbey marathon and watched all of season 2.  Since I had missed all the episodes of season 3 up until last week, I went to PBS.org and watched them via my Kindle Fire HD.  Not in Hi-Def, but at least I am current on all the episodes.  Hope they will continue the series...this historical fiction is outstanding...and the wardrobes for the cast is outstanding.
B000024ZZ0|5.0|Thunder is/was a great bluesy hard rock band with GREAT vocals. I believe they still do occasional shows mostly if not exclusively in Europe. I never understood why they didn't break big here considering the rock with great guitar work PHENOMINAL vocals and the obligatory radio friendly power ballads mixed in. I think any of their records are worth a buy but this one in particular along with \\"Backstreet Symphony\\" are my personal favorites. LONG LIVE THUNDER
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is great! I have thrown away my old alarm clock and now I use nothing else. Its so much nicer to wake up to. I recommend it!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game no complaints especially since its free. I would highly recommend this for horse lovers every where! It is a must have!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so much more fun than the first one. graphics are so much better and game play is much more fun!! get it!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. it seems real a little bit.fun to take care of the horses.lots of mini games to play.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I loved temple run the original, but this one promised a lot more. So I got it for the kindle fire, and it worked perfectly until I tried to like it on Facebook. It wouldn't even let me go back to the game, yet alone like it. I am currently working on uninstalling and reinstalling it to see if it helps. My advice don't like it or it will probably freeze on you.<br />Other than that I love it. But that's a major problem.<br />Good luck
B0095P33IW|5.0|I gave this rendering of Captain America such a high rating because this movie expresses  so eloquently what a true american is and why he is that way.<br /><br />I think the actors in the movie were tailor made for the roles that they portray in this film, and that the villian fits into his acting<br />role like a glove.<br /><br />I would be careful who I recommended this film to because there  are some people who don't take kindly to a flag waving movie of this calibre, but as for me and mine we loved it.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|love the app  a lot!!! it works really well!!!! how can ppl rate it 1 star when its almost a 5 star app.?!
B002ZLAHE6|5.0|I love this movie! My teenage daughters and husband loved it too!  One of Sandra Bullock's best performances.  I would definitely recommend it.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|Arrived quickly and in good condition. American Horror Story -First Season is very good.  Unexpected events, you must watch all of the series to fully understand the story.
B008476HBM|3.0|I just purchased this because it was free and I had already read it a long time ago. If you like the classics, this is a good buy.
B000096I9G|5.0|seriously - bought this as a present, and not only was I blown away by the production values, the sound quality, everything...but found myself listening to The Cure like I hadn't been drowned in them by my friends in college.  IF you're a fan, this is a must have.  if you're not?  borrow it, and see if it doesn't change your mind.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|He liked it ....I haven't read it as of yet....fairly violent, but that is par for the course...will read another Jack Reacher...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun game but it drives me nuts when I can't get past a specific level...and of course, I won't give it a rest either...HA!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is one of my favorites.  In fact, it's the third time I've read it.  I can't wait for the next book to be released...I love GIDEON!!!
0385344333|3.0|This is my first Reacher novel. I have read the mixed reviews and I'm thinking I should have listened to the negative ones before I picked this book up. The plot is what drew me to read this book; however, the writing and dialogue is terrible! It's like a 10th grader wrote this book. I'm about 1/4 of the way through and I'm not sure if I want to finish it. I probably will just because it is sort of interesting if you can get past the juvenile/choppy writing. My opinion would have to agree with the others (who don't have such a great opinion on this book), start with the earlier Reacher novels.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|this game is so much fun. I can sit and play it for hours. its so addicting just like the original.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|nicely executed, great cast, gorgeously dressed sets, and George RR Martin's twisty tale is well-represented. I was pleasantly surprised at how well the cast managed to evoke the subtler aspects of the characters, and how well the script-writer managed to make a hugely complex series into a visual feast.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is such a great show...so glad that good television can still be made without half naked women and violence.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a fantastic app for use at home and when traveling.  We can check on the weather at home and where we are staying.  The radar is really useful and the 15 day forecast is extremely useful for planning ahead when traveling.  A must have!
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Read this book irrespective of your field of endeavor.... it dissects life and makes it have entirely different meaning. Will greatly reccommend this book any time.
0765325950|5.0|This was an awesome ending to a great series. I am going to start reading it over again now that it is over, the wheel keeps on turning
0307730697|5.0|The story was something that everone has seen in their family or friends. This story was tragic, but proved that with strong will and Gods guidence we all can accomplish great things. If you want to try to understand what it takes to be a true hero, read this book.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I was asked to add a review, though it looks like everyone here is already a fan. These are great shows to watch with the family: good creative fun with deep threads of morality and ethics. I mourn for US television, which has taken the Benny Hill route for the most part. This show is a kind of a cult favorite, one might say, but what sort of cult would this be? The Doctor is a quirky fellow, but these are great shows by almost any measure. I see some complaints about the DVD product, but I am watching these on Prime Instant: great benefit! Great shows!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This books really helped me understand myself and natural tendencies. As an introvert, it helps me understand my relationships better and be able to clearly communicate better to my wife. She now understands why I am not always wanting the spotlight or excited go to every party! Great read
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have never done bidding but I enjoyed it and finally won the item I wanted. You learn how to bid on eBay quickly. Thanks eBay!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best period piece I have ever seen. A very special show. We are really excited for season three.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it feels like I actually have a horse. I've always wanted a horse and now I have one. Everyone should have this app.
B005HSL626|5.0|i am hooked - just love this game. thanks. never thought i cold get hooked on a game. but i did and i love it.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Enjoying this book immensely, and I cannot put it down.  I just wish there was a fourth book in this series
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Seldom do you see such a most enjoyable entertainment experience.  Just imagine, no cursing (I'm far from a prude), no raw sex (see prude), no computer generated effects (hooray).  So well done, from performances to directing, etc., it's great to see that this type of thing can still be out there.  A dozen thumbs up!!
B003FBMS4W|3.0|The movie is OK but drags on too long. Liked the plot, loved the scenery (Monument Valley, Utah though the story is set in Texas).  If you love Westerns, you'll like this movie.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I just love this show.  I didn't know it.existed until a friend.told.me.about  it at the end of.season 3 and that was at the end of season 3 so imagine my rush to get them all and catchup before the 4 episode
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|The portrayal of alcoholism was so on spot it was scary.  Denzel had me believing he was not acting, but being himself.  Afterwards I googled him just to be sure that it was him &#34;acting&#34;.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I love the sound of the Lumineers - they remind me of the folk sound I grew up with - and wanted to see if I liked more of their songs than the ones I've heard on the radio. I checked out the album on Amazon just to hear the samples and when I saw it was only $3.99 I jumped at the chance to buy it! After listening to the album a few times I'm very happy I did. I hope this trend in music continues.
B005KELW26|5.0|The quality is top notch. I would recommend this product for purchase. The color is really pretty. You will not regret this purchase.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app was really fun!! I like the complexity to it. The mining carts are my favorite. I also love how u can pay a gem to save yourself. The app was working fine until now(February 9th) . It wont load. The screen blanks out to the home screen.
B0037A4ILC|4.0|Did this movie need a love interest?  A non-interesting love interest, at that?  Clearly, the movie gets high marks for dispassionate romance -- how much better it would have been to tell the mountaineering bits without the girl.<br /><br />As a result of some other reviews, I will get \\"The White Spider\\" by Heinrich Harrer and \\"The Beckoning Silence\\" by Joe Simpson to read the gripping story.<br /><br />Nice to have the visuals of climbing gear and adventure from the movie.  Too bad about the girl.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0874779405 The White Spider]]<br />[[ASIN:0898869412 The Beckoning Silence]]
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I Enjoyed this book from start to finish! Nice caracters, Nice story, you don't suspect anything and you don't get bored!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|If you plan on reading this book or ANY of the 50 shades books you can expect to come across a few things.<br />1) A LOT of sex. So much so that you'll find yourself skimming through the sex scenes. You will start to wonder if people are like this in real married life. They hump like rabbits.<br />2) An infuriating female lead. She's just all over the place, she has no idea why she does certain things and they always get her into trouble. Sometimes she makes up for it by being a little bad-ass.<br />3) A controlling, overprotective male lead with a lot of issues. He's a total control freak and also extremely caring; at times you will find yourself wishing you had a guy like that. I felt bad for him at times but other times, he frustrated the hell out of me (as did she).<br />4) A lot of repetition, gasping, frowning, muttering, etc. You get the point.<br />5) Frankly, by the end of the books I was wishing I had an Elliot not a Christian, he seems like a lot of fun and carefree living. Maybe the author should write about him.<br /><br />SO that being said, if you do not like any of those things, you find them annoying or irritating, do NOT read the books. Simple. So we don't have to read reviews about people saying idk why I read this. This is exactly what you should expect. I personally loved the plot, not so much the writing style. The end.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Look forward to watching Downton Abbey every week. The most refreshing thing on TV in years.  Don't miss out.  Thanks PBS!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|What a wonderful story about a truly amazing man.  Wow. I find it incredible that a man with such talent lived a life unnoticed, except for those on the other side of the world.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|My children didn't like it and they like most children movies. I myself thought the story-line was very boring and unimaginative
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Loved this book! Not a teens book at all. Hope there will be a follow up book. This is a 'can't put down book' once started. Enjoy!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|More than half the book a repetitive description of the physical personal relationship between the two young characters. It did not ring real.<br />The twist in the tail which explained the odd behaviour was quite rivetting, but to me did not make up for the early boredom.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this app it the best mincraft app it's just like the minecraft app on the computer I give it 5stars if I could<br /><br />Good job on the bows and the new update its great the as armor
B0093ST02E|3.0|I found this movie to be a sad.  It is about the downward spiral of a marriage.  The ending was strange and I wouldn't tell a friend to rent it.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I love the characters, the costumes, the actors, the set, the time period . . . basically I really enjoy this show.  It looses one star because I think it might be a &#34;chick&#34; show.  My husband doesn't hate it, but he doesn't really enjoy when I make him watch it with me either.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I actually got introduced to it by my 6 year old granddaughter - she loves it, so I thought I would get it and enjoy it too. It is simple and that is what I can handle...lol.... I am not a BIG problem solver, so simple is good for me...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great app. 10x better than the first. I own all three and this is by far the most active and entertaining.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Eye of the Needle is interesting throughout.  Good book for a rainy day. Good character development.  Exciting end and total wrap up of story line is done well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season with all its twists and turns has been great and I think the best of the three. Not liking the ending but so be it, life is not always what we think it will be.
B004TMPJP6|3.0|I have only been using this product for two days.  So far, I like it.  I particularly like the fact that it allows you to list subtasks under a major task.  Once I've used it for a longer time and get more familiar with it, I may change my rating.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|Excellent storyline that keeps your interest throughout the entire movie. The actors played each roll very well. One character is completely over the top of controlling lives of others.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I am not impressed with the &#34;new&#34; google...I prefer the old. It is easier to get where you want than this one.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|just  another great BBC series!  watched all 4 seasons and loved every one of them.  brendan  coyle is a great actor
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book is very confusing and a slow read.  The characters keep jumping all over the place, have difficult names to remember, and the progress of the book is very slow.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|It's great to hear Led Zeppelin perform one more time again before going their separate way once more. Though Robert Plant doesn't quite hit the high notes any more, he makes up for it with his weathered voice.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thought this book was both tragic and hilarious, John green has made a beautiful, hilarious,and  entertaining book out of such a sad, serious subject. God bless John green for making this book.
B000SLQGGS|4.0|Not what I expected when I watched Black Snake Moan. I had heard the title before because I am a fan of blues music and heard Blind Lemon Jefferson's version many years ago. It does have blues music in it and it plays a part in the storyline. When you hear about a young white girl being chained up in a older black guy's house, you probably think something along the lines of kidnapping or forced sexual relations. It's interesting how the characters develop in this movie and how the interaction between the two main characters leads to the conclusion. Highly recommended.
B004G5Z0B4|1.0|When ordering I did not notice that the DVD is Region 2 and is incompatible with USA DVD players.  I think this notice should have been clearly stated.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Taken by itself, it's not a bad movie, though there are certainly plenty of plot holes, and I found myself questioning the intelligence of the characters more than a few times.<br /><br />However, as the prequel that's not really a prequel(wink, wink, nudge, nudge) to Alien, it was not very good.  I can only hope that Mr. Scott doesn't decide to try to make a prequel that's not really a prequel to Bladerunner now.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful series enthralls the view with quality acting and dialog. Even the accents play their roles in this exquisite piece of craft.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Denzel is at his Oscar-caliber best.  Complexity beyond typical Hollywood blockbuster fare.  Unsentimental view of alcolholism.  Grabs you and does not let go.  Fantastic use of soundtrack.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book mixes great historical research with Stephen King's great writing style for a book that you cannot put down till it's finished.  I have been reading King since I picked up The Shining at the library many moons ago.  And I've read everything since.  However, a few years ago I started to be disappointed with some of his books as he seemed to stray off the path of his wonderful writing.  He's back one hundred percent with this one!  Riveting book that you will want to finish in one sitting.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I would have rated this book 4 stars if it weren't for its ending, which (and trust me, I'm not exagerrating) is the most unsatisfying of any book, of any genre, that I can recall reading. Well written, with interesting character studies and clever (though far fetched) plot twists -- all rendered moot by the slap in the face ending. What was this author thinking?!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is awesome.  get this app because you can build what ever you want.  get this app please please please please please please
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|If you even half-way care about Star Trek you will love this product.<br /><br />Best Features:<br />1. This version was taken from the original film and cleaned up considerably. It's a beautiful transfer.<br />2. Yes, they have enhanced the old special effects with new CGI technology but it looks much better and more natural then what George Lucas did to the original Star Wars Trilogy. It simply takes the original look of the Enterprise and spruces it up a bit. They even recreated the original theme with a new orchestra but you can hardly tell the difference. I realize some of you purists will still have a problem with this but not to worry you can select to view each episode with the original effects and mono sound recording.<br />3. This blue-ray set comes with the original preview for each episode. It's like stepping back into the past and catching a glimpse of how the original Treckies heard news of each episode week by week.<br />4. As I hoped The last disc of season three contains both the original rough cut and the spruced-up colorized version of the unaired pilot, The Cage. I love Star Trek but I wonder if it might had been better if Roddenberry had been allowed to follow his initial conception of the show.<br />5. Something I was not expecting, season 2 contains an entire disc dedicated to the tribbles. It even has the DS9 cross-over episode and an episode from the animated series. I was never able to watch more than one episode of the animated series and this feature has perked my interest and I plan to get the show on bl-ray when it becomes available.<br />6. And of course like any good series collection this is filled with commentaries and specials.<br /><br />I can't imagine why anyone would dislike this blu-ray collection. It's a must have for all hard-core or even soft-core Sci-Fi fans. Mine arrived yesterday and I still have a high from it.
B001QURA7E|4.0|I wore out my cassette tape in the late 70's. This album was my first exposure to Yes.  I knew of Jon and Vangelis from Chariots of fire but did not make the connection to Jon Anderson until after I bought this album.<br /><br />I was quite a synthesizer head in the 70's. &#34;Arriving UFO&#34; has a lot of those quirky 70's kind of analog synth sounds that take me back there and &#34;Save The Whale&#34; captures the spirit of the Save the Earth Movement back then.<br /><br />I say Yes to classic Yes...
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is very easy to use and provides a lot of freedom for getting inspiration and developing your own style.<br />Love it and so glad I have it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book enough to hate to see it end.<br />You really got involved with the characters.<br />Some good twists to it!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I purchased this after viewing &#34;Lincoln&#34; resulting in a thirst for more knowledge about this exceptional statesman.  I'm thoroughly enjoying learning about his life and times and a critical period in our nation's history, about which I know so little.
B00AYQNOLW|5.0|Takes you outside your small slice of life into places you may not be comfortable with, which is always a good thing.
B004OC07F8|5.0|Having come from a rather technical background, working in a relatively small professional environment, I bought Blue Ocean Strategy at the suggestion of a potential business partner who has followed it's principals successfully in several endeavors.  I found it fascinating, straight forward and easy to comprehend, without having to wade through a lot of academic pontificating to get to the meat of the concepts.  I recommend it, highly, to anyone considering starting a new business or looking to rescue an existing venture.
0446677450|5.0|Points out the advantages of working for yourself/owning a business vs working for someone else. Encourages the reader to 'think outside the box'.
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|Always enjoyed the characters on this show  .... Took a different angle on the Star Trek storyline but still occasionally employed plots and cast members from Next Generation.
B003O86FMW|4.0|You really get involved with the characters.<br />Even tho it was a work of fiction, you actually could feel what the environment was like as if you were a part of that life.<br />I was glad to know there was a 3rd book to read as I wanted more to the story!
0449000729|5.0|I got this book many years ago in hard back as a freebie from the \\"History Book Club\\".  It was almost too big to fit in the standard book mailers they used!<br /><br />I loved it from the start.  The idea of interweaving extended families through the years for this area of England was unique to me but it worked.  It brought the entire story to life because you had something that tied it to the area so well.<br /><br />I got Edward Rutherfurd's first book as a freebie and I loved it so much that I now have ALL of his books (including pre-ordering the last two, \\"New York\\" and \\"Paris\\").  That makes for an effective Freebie.<br /><br />The detail of history and the character development made me a real fan of both Historical Fiction and Edward Rutherfurd.<br /><br />The only disappointment is that after this one, none have shown the DEEP history (from pre-historic times, even before England was an island) that I loved so much so none of the others is QUITE as good as this one.
B0068THAGY|4.0|The troupe of kid filmmakers were great. The monster itself was a little disappointing but it was all made up for by the characters. It felt like a big budget, more grown up Scooby Doo episode, except the monster was real in the end &#62;.&#60;
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Quality and masterpiece amazon stream is great I would recommend to a friend. Can wait to get season uk 3
B00APUYN0I|5.0|hilarious - fat amy made the movie!  her one liners were a hit.  i would definitely recommend - great movie!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it! It is very fun and addicting. I will be playing this one for a very long time.
B000Q7ZND6|5.0|Interesting take on angels, hell & the in between...surprisingly well acted...great cast. Blu Ray effects were phenominal. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Great buy!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the series and could not put the books down. Loved the social commentary and the way it was written. Great character development and original ideas.
161701091X|5.0|I  have been ordering MJ calendars for years and this has been the best one so far!  Thanks a bunch!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Denzel was too much character for this poor movie. You can see a lot of gaps, incosistencies and facts that does not match in real life.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Got hooked on it during the first season.  I feel it just as good as the first season.  Many twists and turns.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Had to finish it in one sitting!  Couldn't sleep until I reached the conclusion.  I love how Rollins' Sigma Force is based on real life science and historical evidence.  I wish he would have explained Jordan's roll a little more thoroughly at the end.  Would love to see him in future novels, or maybe even a series of his own.  Nailed the \\"kick ass cattle dog\\" personality, couldn't have picked a better breed for the part!
B002HFP0QU|3.0|This is a very nice Bee Gees collection. The problem is that two of my favorite songs are not full versions. Heartbreaker is only 1:05 and Guilty is only 2:23. Had I carefully checked before buying this set, probably I would not have purchased it, but now that I have it, it's not worth returning.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|The book kept me interested but I felt as if I kept waiting for something to happen, and it never did.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Well I think the second one . I mean like come on this one has minecarts ; vines to slide down on ; a bigger gorilla?a skeleton face gorilla? Oh who cares but I loved it .
B003NS2T9G|5.0|enjoyed throughly. could not have been better.<br /><br />liked the characters.  look forward to watching the rest of the series in the future
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Loved the book. I am a sucker for back stage insights. Make me respect her as an artist even more.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Really enjoyed this. Can not wait to see the next season. Good thriller and did not get bored, kept my intrest.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Good show... Good enough to blast you in the ass.  By the end of the second season, you'll definitely feel as though something grabbed your hips and really blasted you in the ass.
B008N1LL42|1.0|What is it with Hollywood insisting that 90 pound girls can battle monsters, aliens and men trained to fight?  The only guy they may be to take is Orlando Bloom.  Rhianna is ridiculous as she saves men that weigh twice as much by simply pulling them up and shoving them as if she has the strength to do it.  Even better, when punched in the face repeatedly by a super robot with super metal fists, she simply shrugs it off and gives the big meanie a dirty look.<br /><br />The effects are over the top silly.  If it was not for Brooklyn Decker, I would have turned this garbage off.<br /><br />The nod to the WWII Vets was the only good part.<br /><br />Hollywood makes real garbage lately.  They rely so much on CGI, that there is no effort to write a good story or make anything slightly reasonable.<br /><br />Stupid, stupid, stupid.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have been a long time Clancy reader and next to Vince Flynn he is probably my next favorite.  This was another great book by him.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Totally love Pinterest! Who wouldn't like it. Looks great on the KF HD I would recommend this app to everyone.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the Star Trek franchise, old and new. I liked the notion of doing a prequel at the time Enterprise was created, though I know many fans did not. The first season did fine with the requisite introduction of the characters and beginning to establish their backgrounds. What Enterprise did exceedingly well throughout its run was continuity. Episode to episode, there are small references, and details carried over from previous episodes and seasons. However, the first season struggled to find the balance between action and character development, and is widely regarded by audiences as having a strange pace. Enterprise really hit its stride in the third and fourth seasons as Manny Coto got more involved with producing the show, and Brannon Braga less involved. This season had a lot of Braga, which, in my opinion, caused it to flounder a bit. This season was a valiant effort and a near miss. There are many strong moments, but as a season it lacked cohesion.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|This Mission: Impossible is getting kind of old. But I still enjoy it.  I fully expect the next movie to include gadgets that allow the geriatric Ethan Hunt to track down the kidnappers of his grandchildren. And I'll watch it and hopefully still enjoy it.<br /><br />Barely makes 3 stars, could have been better with an improved supporting cast that had been expected from the previous movies.
B00932A3SK|5.0|This was great. Well developed plot somewhat like Fargo. The twists and turns are unexpected. A great European thriller! I didn't care it I had to read the subtitles. It was that good.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This book was very scientific. Not the most entertaining read I've ever had!<br />I would not recommend this book to others.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Works great on my android tablet.  What a  scary game!  Slenderman freaked me out.  He is impossible to second guess.
B003FBMS4W|4.0|This film is a landmark in film history. Anyone who has an interest in film and in the genre of Western should watch it. A lot of great directors have named this movie as an influence on thier careers....and for the time it was made it is a raw look at racism. It's not exactly a comfortable view of it.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|The Adventures of Tintin is a thoroughly enjoyable film.  Why should you insist my review be a certain length?  I resent that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a wonderful app is amazing and awesome and please continue to add realistic features to the game the horse are so big and I would like fouls to be added
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I am a Tom Cruise fan as well as a fan of the Mission: Impossible series, both TV and movie versions.  It contained the requisite amount of special effects, action, suspense, and adventure to make me a satisfied viewer.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|great read, funny and tense...good characters...I would recommend this for all mystery readers...This book will make me go back and read &#34;The Lion&#34; and others
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Being a book worm I\\"m always on the lookout for books like this and have now read all his books, and from a first hand experience I can say that if you like 1you like them all. I have almost read every book in the library and this author\\"s books are even better than Harry potter so if you need a new book, try this, it's the best!
B009YMKL4A|5.0|As a X-Men fan since early childhood, any X-men film is a must see but this one is amazing. To see the long awaited, intriguing relationship of Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) develop was fascinating. However, my only complaint of the film is the choice of characters. Being that this film was 'first class', it should of also had Cyclops, Jean Grey, Angel, and Iceman. Instead they used the horrible (in my eyes) characters Banshee and Angel Salvadore. Other than the negative pick of characters the film's story-line, special effects, character development and interpersonal relationships were superb.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Every year my sister asks for CD's for Christmas and every year I get them. She loves this album and so do I, she hasn't taken it out her car yet.....great buy indeed!!!!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I've only read a few of books on this subject, but this one didn't gab my attention.  I haven't been motivated to finish it.  I didn't like the way it transition to the people in his family then to his experiences.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I like Dr.Who,its crazy.I prefer the original Dr.,but the others will do also because there are quite a few of them.
B007L96SI6|3.0|I must say that I like the fact that she chose to be a \\"throwback\\" artist at least on this release.  There are 3 songs on here that I love: 3) Liar  11) Follow Me (I'm Right Behind You) and 13) What You Don't Know.  If you notice 2 of these 3 are not on her \\"regular\\" release but are on her \\"deluxe\\" release. I logged in today to buy it for a friend and noticed the missing tracks.  So those of you that haven't heard the 3 additional tracks on her deluxe version should check it out! I think that overall Haley has a great concept going but other than these 3 favorite tracks of mine--I find her \\"hooks\\" (chorus) parts take away from most of the tracks.  I really enjoy her verses and bridges but not the hooks so much.  JMO......Also if you like Haley you would probably also like Casey Abrams the guy she was paired to sing with often on AI.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|For fans of John Corey (like me), this is a must-read. Corey (and his commentaries) keep getting funnier and I keep laughing out loud. Some people have commented on the thin story-line. Understandable, but I still had a hard time putting this book down, was still sad that it ended when it did, and will look forward eagerly to the next Corey book. DeMille remains my favourite writer.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|I'm watching the DVD right now. The sound quality is excellent. Clapton and Winwood are magical together. I've been a Clapton fan since the Yardbirds and have been fortunate enough to see him in performance twice, once with Cream and again as a solo act with Phil Collins on drums. Although I've followed Winwood from Spencer Davis on, I've never seen him live. This DVD makes up for it. Between the the various Clapton incarnation tunes, the Blind Faith tunes, and various Winwood incarnation tunes, the set is tremendous and covers just about every period of their musical careers. Both are in top form - Clapton more so than any other fairly recent set I've seen. I've always thought he has needed competition or maybe its inspiration from other great musicians to play his best, i.e. Mayall, Bruce, Allman, Harrison, etc. and Winwood definitely fills the bill. The interviews are short and add some perspective on their careers and the concert. There is too much good music to mind a few interviews interspersed among the performances. This is going to be one of my favorite music DVDs.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Excellent writer with fabulous descriptive power. 4 star because of the disappointing ending, as well as the theological point he attempts to  establish that the three major religions are of equal value and truth, which is  not valid.  Christianity stands alone as truth.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Excellent!  My absolute favorite science fiction show ever.  A detailed and unique storyline that you can follow with great acting.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The story line is weak and the love story is weaker.<br /><br />Sparks tries to keep readers gripped by the secret the female lead is keeping in regards to her past life. But it's painfully obvious the whole time what has happened with her and her development of a new love affair is boring quite frankly.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's an awesome game and I play it a lot all the time at home and over the weekends all the time
0765325950|3.0|Robert Jordan left an awful lot of storyline hanging and Brandon Sanderson has done a pretty good job of cleaning up.  Still, I felt that some endings did not live up to the foreshadows cast in the earlier books.  In particular, Rand's ultimate battle was just so-so.  I expected bigger roles for Min and for Logain.  I would love for the series to continue because several story lines still have plenty of unconsumed fuel.  Overall, the Wheel of Time series has been the best read of my life and I hope to read them again some day.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I made a mistake opening this book. A huge one. What modern American college student doesn't have an email address? Hello! Universities give those upon enrollment! This author is a serious idiot who didn't even bother to do the research before writing this crap. If you are from England and know nothing about U.S. students, then how the Hell would you be allowed to publish a book with so many cultural inaccuracies? That is where she lost me, end of Ch. 14. I was suffering through this to see if the plot and characters would reveal anything of satisfying substance. Worthless waste of my time. I already had a problem with the terrible dialogue and the main character's lack of a spine or a brain. The writing is just plain terrible. The only reason this became a bestseller is because people bought it out of curiousity and not because they had read the reviews.<br /><br />Guess what I found out? This author was a fanfiction writer in the Twilight universe. All she did was jack Stephanie Meyer's characters and give them a BDSM twist. Some moron publisher saw an opportunity for them both to make a buck off the erotic aspect. The hype is just hype. Don't waste your money or your time. I beg you.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I picked this up on hearsay, but this is without doubt one of the best books (other than the established 'classics' I'm working back through) which I've read in the past few years. Very much in the style of Bradbury, but up there with Wyndham - this will be a classic of the future.  Whilst the first part is the strongest (believe it was a standalone short story) the next two parts develop the story in a compelling way - characterisation is especially sharp, and the silo environment artfully brought to life with minimal interruption of narrative flow.<br /><br />Essential reading, whether you are sci-fi orientated or not.  This is not sci-fi, but rather an incredibly intelligent take on social norms and human traits - it will be discussed for years to come.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great characterization. Good narration. But predictable ending. There are not so many twists in the story. I loved the girl Katniss through out the book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I greatly enjoyed reading this book.<br />It is very interesting and keeps you engaged in the story especially for people who like to read about WWII.
B008M7JODC|4.0|We are having a good time watching this series as a family.  It seems like it is heading out beyond the scifi line, to bazzar at times but it brings itself back just before it goes too far.  The charicters are fun, the plot is well tied together.  Looking forward to season two, hope that it continues to be thoughtfully put together.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subway surfers because it's entertaining it gives us reward that are fun to get.it's a fun changelleng because you learn every step of the way.sometimes when your bored you can play subway surfers because it entertains you when there's nothing to do.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I feel as if this book was written just for me.  Something I have always struggled with is feeling like I was only \\"copy cat\\" creative, I didn't think I was original. This book gives you the freedom, the permission to do just that, copy things, and you realize that's what you should have been doing all along.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Before beginning this novel, I thought I knew where it was going and what it would have to say. However, without spoilers, the novel was really unpredictable and I enjoyed the twists. Also, the characters are drawn with depth and fun to read about. Definitely recommended.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|This film takes you from the very humble beginning to the bitter end of Bob's life and fills in everything in between.  The candidness that friends and family had when speaking about Bob made the documentary what all documentaries should be.  Real!
B007VYAJAE|5.0|packed with photos, videos, interviews, and music. Bob Marley was an amazing human - with foibles and superior moral courage.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Witty, packed with drama and history.  A fun and entertaining look into the early 1900's and the interesting dynamics of the British aristocracy.
B0012TUPRQ|5.0|Once again, RAM product. Solves many a problem when needing to mount a tablet or anything else for an aircraft cockpit.
B002OSXDAU|4.0|This book is a classic and tho may have been required reading in an  old college literature class  is better reading as an<br />adult 40 years later
B0063M22QO|3.0|Worth what you pay, but no points or penalties for &quot;hints&quot;. good for teaching shapes. not real challenging, can schuffle so never lose.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This was such a gripping tale.  I could hardly believe the things that happened yet knew they could be true.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Very engaging and fun.  Learn about engineering, physics, gravity, jet propulsion and more without even realizing it!!  Some scenarios very easy but others are quite challenging. Enjoy!
B0041D843M|5.0|A brave expose that takes a detailed look at our standard American diet, the basis for the teaching of nutrition in our educational system, and cites various studies (especially the China Study) that points the way to good health. A must read for those seeking optimal health and longevity.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Well written and well acted.  Only problem is too many crises.  It keeps being said that they are protecting and helping the city, but you never see them doing anything for the city.  Just one crisis after another.
1439102813|5.0|this book took you into the world of alzheimer victims.  it will help you identify with care givers of this horrible disease.
B0086213XW|3.0|I think this movie had potential to be one of the really good ones.  It let us in to the awkward moments a married couple can have even after 5+ years of marriage when you'd think by now, you knew each other but come to find out you've really moved more apart then you have together. The movie was ruined for me by her \\"discovery phase\\" or whatever you call it.  I didn't understand why that was in the movie. It did nothing for the movie.  Ehh...not a bad watch if you're looking for something serious.
B000LJ9ZWE|4.0|While its technology is dated, this remains a classic SF film dealing with the consequences of our technology getting beyond our control.
B0036UW09U|4.0|Best of the movies made from this story except for the language which took away from a great film and story
B0080XN3C6|5.0|Her music is so fresh and full of life. She shows great variety and can knock it out of the park in the studio as well as live. Love her work!!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Open-mindedness it is the word that descibes this series. Shatters all dogmatic views to ones reality (shows:)) and gets close to the modern perceptions and understandings of it. The plot becomes  evermore absorbing as the episodes progress.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Intense, keeps you watching.  Another action packed movie with Tom Cruise.  Keeps you wishing for follow-on movies in the near future.
B004DMIIUU|1.0|I have always enjoyed Asian moviemakers use of action and history, even if the action is a little over the top and the history taken artistic advantage of. In the case of Goemon, however, the advantage taken was beyond the line of good taste. The events of the story are based, loosely, upon the events near the end of the medieval period of Japan, what is most commonly called Sengoku, or country at war. Almost all of the characters, major ones and minor ones, are at least named after historical people, but that is where the relation to history stops.<br /> How history is handled in this movie is almost comical expect for one fact that makes it insulting. This is just a movie and no reasonable intelligent person believes that history will be treated honorably by those who make entertainment, and sometimes that is just fine. However, in Goemon, the goal of the hero is to kill Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a general of Oda Nobunage who very briefly unified Japan before Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1600. The events in the movie have Hideyoshi meet his end before he orders the invasion of the Korean peninsula. This invasion, known as the Imjin War, lasted for seven years and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It was an utter failure for Hideyoshi and was a brutal war for the Korean people. The fact that this movie wants to dig up the roots of history to tell their tale and then skip over these blood soaked seven years straight to the Battle of Sekigahara is insulting. Perhaps such an inslut could be forgiven if the entertainment factor was there, but that is not the case.<br /> While Goemon is live action, it takes on an Anime influenced fantasy appearance with a touch of steam-punk. The steam-punk element is mostly found in the firearms used and a few objects, like a very sophisticated door and a mechanical Pandora's Box. The Anime influence is even more apparent because everything is computer generated, even the actors themselves during some action scenes. This really doesn't work well, as nothing looks real. The entire world is computer generated, grass, water, trees, sometimes even the furniture the actors are sitting on looks generated. The CGI effects are not good, there is a horrible contrast between the actors and their environment. If one wanted to be nice they could say that this was done on purpose to bring closer the worlds of live action and Anime, but the argument that the production company is cheap could also have a strong case.<br /> The writing is terrible. At the beginning of the movie a lieutenant of Hideyoshi, Mitsunari, is having his men search for Pandora's Box, which Goemon has stolen. They are very worried over it and are killing anyone who might get wind of it. So, one would think that this box would play a large role in this tale, which it doesn't. You see it at the start and then in disappears. It is not even explained why a object of western mythology is in Japan in the first place. No one talks about it until the very end when Goemon hands to a young boy he has been taking care of and gives him some banal speech about hope, or not being vengeful, before Goemon goes and avenges the death of his former lord Nobunaga. I am not sure. No one says anything worth saying or anything that makes that much sense. The motivations of the character is equally unclear. While it might seem like vengeance or greed is a motivation, characters don't seem fully committed. Of course, this could be the fault of the actors who are all flat and deadpan. Whether it is the fault of the writers, the director, or actors there is very little emotion or believably to these Anime devolved historical figures.<br /> The only thing the actors have going for them is their looks. Just about everyone in this movie is model from a magazine cover. Expect for those men who are to inspire a very weak and ineffectual comic relief, they are all handsome and stoic. The women are beautiful even when wearing some of the most ridiculous costumesly doesn't work well, as nothing looks real.

The unbelievable good looks of the actors just adds to the unbelievably of the entire movie. It does however explain their poor acting.
006145205X|5.0|Excellent, thought out expression of living glass half empty/empty or glass half full/full---difficult to put this book down during a break in the reading
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great and challenging game. More interesting than the first. Thanks for making a second game. Thanks a whole bunch .
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|I had seen some of the previews and should have watched the trailer. This movie should be rated as I think people have the right to know up front that it is pretty rank. I would never allow any child of any age to watch it. I shut it off within a minute of the credits and should have shut it off sooner.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love It!!!!!  So glad it was offered with my Prime Membership.  Almost don't want the season to end.  Characters are great, storyline is great . . .
B000FCKC4C|3.0|Perhaps I have read too many similar books in the last couple of years i.e. fables or stories about the search for meaning in life.  This is well written and I did enjoy however the message and &#34;truths&#34; are similar.  There are only so many of these that one reads before they all blend together and become a bit tiresome.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Glad I purchased the trilogy as one package.  Read right through from the beginning to the end of the third book.  Great plot and interesting twists
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The series is outstanding drama in every conceivable way:  plot, setting, casting, ensemble acting, and direction.  Season 2 is wonderfully done, and a seamless, inspiring extension of the storyline established in Season 1.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|OK movie, my husband fell asleep during it. The beginning is really good then it starts to lag a bit
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|very simple standard script, with some Very Funny parts to it. Good cast of characters help my rating. I recommend

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is such an awsome game! Compared to Temple Run 1 this one I think has a more variety of obstacles.Which I think makes it more fun.
0062080237|4.0|My copy of Neil Gaiman's American Gods (Authored Preferred Text)is missing pages 143-174. Does anyone else have this problem with the physical copy of the 10th anniversary edition?<br /><br />Other than that, Gaiman's world of ancient gods in rural America is a humorously dark, adventure ride that will keep you from putting the book down (unless of course, you're missing an entire section.. ugh.. off to torrent the book)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I didn't think I would like this book, but I read all three within two weeks.  Where are you Christian Grey?????

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love it, hate it.  Can't stop playing it once I start it.  It's frustrating trying to get 3 stars, exciting one I get them and can move on to the next level.  May have to delete it from my device so I can get something else done.  lol  Have started limiting my self to once a day.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|For some time now, I had been thinking this was a child's film not having read the review.  Had time to check it out realizing that it was a Spielberg film.  AMAZING.....loved watching how the film was made, too.

B002VHI8FE|5.0|Anyone with a sense of adventure will enjoy reading this story.  It delivers more than just a simple plot, instead there are multiple characters with intertwining storylines.  I would not be surprised to see this as a major motion picture.  It is that good!
B001ECDVKE|5.0|We bought this movie so our Granddaughters could watch it and laugh as we did the first time we saw it.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|This book gave me a new and deeper insight into autistic children.  I realize everyone is different, but reading about life through the eyes of the afflicted person really brings it home.
B002PNER9U|5.0|I love the play and the film of RENT. The music is great, the casting is great, the story line is an emotional roller coaster. Love is love and a beautiful thing. Changed me forever on my personal views.

B004EARTN8|3.0|Interesting premise and ambitiously shot. The whole film takes place in a coffin.<br /><br />Barring the holes and gaps in the film, it's a bold undertaking.
B000V5Y1SQ|1.0|In the Trek future, leaders will be spineless, pseudo-intellectuals who spend their time trying to solve math and science problems for which they have a woeful lack of education, experience, and talent rather than spend their time solving the military and political problems for which they, one would think, will have been trained and, based on their ranks, will appear to have sufficient experience. Fortunately, either their villainous enemies will self-destruct or super powerful aliens will appear deus ex machina to save the day. Or maybe what will happen is that everyone will live under the constant threat of being forced to watch Star Trek spin-offs. That would be the ultimate punishment.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|My wife and I watch this movie every Ground Hog Day( Febuary 2nd) and never get tired of it. The VHS tape we watched this year was losing it's quality. That is why I bought this DVD copy.
B005PK553C|5.0|Great show!!! Really liked watching it. I started the second season first. After I finished that I had to see season 1
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 games +1 is a great game but it is very hard as you go and you have ponits that you get and once you had those poniys you could buy other games NOT WITH YOU REAL MONEY but this game is great I think u should get it

B0087GZ8YW|4.0|As usual a great read from Ian Rankin. Rebus is up to his subversive best in this tale of missing people and as always it is with regret when the book is finished. Bring on more Rebus solving &#34;cold&#34; cases!
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Great Movie, very inspiring and I love that Eddie Vedder did all the music.  I had no idea it was based on a true story, makes it that much more inspiring!
B005OKTPKC|5.0|Outstanding book....  Keeps you interested from start to finish.  Grisham is my favorite author, I read all his books.<br />Amazon makes it easier for me to get his and other books easily and very cost  effective.  I love Amazon and I am a loyal fan.  Keep up the great job..
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I like m I movies .Great suspense and all done on a blu-ray dvd.Get this one for your collection.And enjoy.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great game for killing time. I love everything about it. I've tried the other hungry shark games but they just don't compare.
B000VZSEWA|5.0|Trent is always experimenting and expanding his sound. Great album. He's grown a lot since he's first begun creating music in the spot light.

B0077EBWVI|1.0|Honestly the movie starts off alright but then  ends up being horrible throughout.Do not buy or rent this movie pleasel
B003JTHXOK|5.0|So exciting. I really like the way the author writes. It is as if you are in the crazy man's head. Freaked me out! I can see why they are making a movie out if it!
B003Z49LYO|5.0|I thought that this show was great, i would definitely recommend it to a friend. The HD quality really helped too.
1423140591|4.0|Enjoyable and entertaining.  Familiarity with the locals was interesting. The only thing that is annoying is having to wait so long for the next installment
B000G73U5Y|5.0|THese bring back so many memories and the album will for others too. Once you listen to  it you rmember how oftgen it was played on the radio. Great tunes.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All 3 books are worth the read. They reach into your imagination, grab a hold and makes you want more. You can't just read 1, each leads to the next, with its own twists and turns. I can not wait for the movie, and to see who will play Christian grey.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Lots of fun if you have a little extra time on your hands.  However, it can be addicting and frustrating at the meeting same time.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|O M G I L O V E T H I S B O O K S O M U C H must read
044024367X|2.0|I agree with the negative reviews of this novel so wholeheartedly that I went looking for a place to express my displeasure and decided to post this review on Amazon.  Yes, the plot was dull, the villain uninvolved and uninteresting, the loose ends numerous.  But the kicker, the thing that absolutely destroyed this novel and made a mockery of the previously well-developed Reacher character, was the ending.  There wasn't the slightest justification or rational explanation for the character's actions in resolving the story.  In fact, they were absurd for him or any similar character in novels of this genre.  It was a cheap, lazy, reckless way to end the story.  I have read subsequent Reacher novels and I can report that similar undermining of the character has not been repeated, so the author at least has done no further damage to his creation.  The farther this novel gets in the rearview mirror, the better.
0765325950|5.0|Been waiting many years for the conclusion. Was not disappointed.  I wish that Robert Jordan was still around to give some excellent examples of fine writing
B004EBT5CU|5.0|A totaly different kind of music but somehow she is a modern, more polished Bonnie Raitt.<br />She too, tells good stories.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would recommend this book. I started reading dark places also by Gillian Flynn. I am enjoying this book as well
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have never played an app as much as I've played this one, it is so addictive.  The way they keep changing the scenery and locations keeps me coming back.  I also appreciate that there is no tilting involved.  Best game ever!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|O M G I L O V E T H I S B O O K S O M U C H  it is amazing
B005IQZB14|4.0|This book reminds us, if we wish to be reminded that when overwhelming pain, suffering<br />and anguish are on our plate getting &#34;back into our body&#34; through a tremendous challenge<br />may provide healing.<br />What concerned me was her hubris on insisting that she be alone.  It was a huge risk and<br />gives the impression to others that hiking alone is OK.<br />It is worth the read.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|Had seen it  advertised excessively on TV.  I enjoyed it and might watch it again, however it is not a priority.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|It's OK, kinda like X-files.  It's funny how every weird thing is related to prior experiments 17 years ago to the same scientist.  And no further research is ongoing?  No other scientists are working for the government any more?  And how many times can they reanimate 1 guy?
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I believe that this movie will be a classic of the modern times.That amazing music,Butler,Rossum and Wilson's performances are simply glorious.One of my favorite scenes,&#34;Masquerade&#34; full of splendor,all in all,a movie I have seen perhaps no less than 60 times,I gave my copy to a friend of mine and the same day I ordered an extra one!.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Of all the sci-fi out there I thought that this show was closest to the vision of a space traveling civilization in the spirit of Heinlein. Once you begin to deal with the distances involved it is only natural that there will be some reversion to the rugged individualism of the frontier - no matter if it is in a starship or in a covered wagon. Humans are humans and no amount of technology will change our tendencies.  Kudos to Firefly for giving us a look at a version of humanity without the rose colored glasses or &#34;view from the top&#34; taken by so much other sci-fi. Shame on Fox for tinkering with and then canceling such a well told story with memorable characters.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very enjoyable game. It is just as fun as playing the game at the video arcade, but it doesn't cost money to play.  It is very relaxing.
B008Y6WPXC|1.0|Last ditch effort to make themselves relevant again. Want any fond memories you had of the 80s pulp nonsense action movies ground into ash and blown into the wind coming from the sewage treatment plant? That seems to be this movie's goal. There is better cgi in Super Mario Brothers for the N64 than is incorporated into the action sequences. Every cliched, tacky plot from the direct to video market is brought in to play, and to far less effect then in more engaging films, like say the He-Man/She-Ra Christmas Special.<br /> Stallone should just be happy with what he has and hope that before he passes completely into obscurity someone will give him a nostalgic walk on in The Italian Stallion porn remake around 2014.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really like it. The game is a little bit like temple run! If you like temple run you should get this game. :)
B005HSL626|5.0|Great for coordination, mind agility and just to have fun! The only thing I don't like is the ads that show up in every single free app.. I know ads are necessary to keep it free, anyways, just shut down the wifi during playtime, and that's it. Looks awesome on kindle fire HD!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very fun easy to play and very realistic. My daughter really enjoys playing this game. Love the challenges and the competition's.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|It works as advertised but why do you need to turn your tablet into a flashlight.- I think it would have been better if it was a kaleidoscopic.<br /><br />.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|The game is really fun you get to do a lot of stuff and its just so fun I play it all the time. I hope you guys play it too.
B00BD14K4W|1.0|Mundane, pedestrian, intellectually insulting. These are all things that Elementary wishes it could rise to the level of. It is too clearly gimmicky to be effectively a gimmick. A disappointment on every level and an insult to any actual Holmes fans. This so far removed from the greatness of the BBC series Sherlock that I  don't think it deserves to inhabit the same universe. The rest of the world must watch elementary and think it was intended for mentally challenged pre-schoolers. If your IQ is below 95, this program no doubt keeps you guessing, but then so would Sesame Street. If you like watching Lucy Liu disprove that Asian women are ageless in appearance, tune in. If you want to be entertained, buy paint...watch it dry.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Steinbeck says this was his best work. Hard to argue with that, although Grapes of Wrath, and &#34;Of Mice and Men&#34; are also terrific. An astute observer of how flawed we all are, Steinbeck shows there is hope for us if we choose to make the struggle. Sam Hamilton rises up out of the pages and, I swear, seems to be sitting down with you over coffee to chat and tell you how the world works and what a wondrous thing life is.
B002NHGG92|5.0|You will not regret spending your time watching this show: the plot is internally consistent (and I am on Season 4 now), the characters are well-developed, and it is a show that I wouldn't mind watching with my children.  The only downside is the show is VERY addictive!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Recommend: Enjoyable great story line, funny, liked the carectures, the music was fun. Good animation for the kids and adults.
B0058YPGSY|2.0|The product came wrapped as advertised and in a timely fashion. But when I got to the fourth disc, the playback was flawed and I missed the last half of the final episode!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Not sure where I have been, but I didn't catch onto this series until a few weeks ago. Since then I have fallen in love with the cast and story line Thankful that Amazon had the past seasons available so that I could catch up with the rest of the world.
B009GEAWOU|1.0|If you do not have ovaries, you will completely miss any appeal this show has, and I hope you are only watching it to get into the pants of someone with ovaries who happens to be a fan. Completely from the female point of view, this show does nothing more than highlight to the rest of the world that \\"men\\" in America are nothing more than feminized ideals brought about by our guilt that we are somehow responsible for women not having penises. It is a complete failure even in its attempts mock itself. The actors are all on their way out of the Hollywood meat-grinder and they know it and are not afraid to let the desperation seep into their performances. You'd just as well watch several Old Navy commercials back to back, at least then you might see some celebs of note.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Loved this and honestly it wasn't at all predictable,  I had no idea where it was going to go until it ended
B009FZZFME|5.0|After suffering through the slow-paced sets of Season 2, Season 3 has been a constant thrill. Zombie hordes abound as the survivors are stretched to their limits and forced to deal with what can only be conceivable in uncharted apocalyptic territory. If you love zombies, action, drama, and hi-def entertainment then look no further.
B00756GKBA|3.0|I love Madonna but this isn't her best effort. Some of the tunes are darn right nasty even for her. If I had heard all of the tunes before I wouldn't have spent my money.
B004J4WKDI|5.0|a deliciously entrancing journey through the beauty of life, learning and love. one actually hopes to see the circus set up on the edge town.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This app is a great way to relax and drift off into a deep sound sleep. When you wake, you will feel rested and relaxed. This is a wonderful app!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Liked the format.<br /><br />It is a quick read.  Easy to pick up and to put down.<br /><br />Unsatisfactory ending.<br /><br />Would not recommend.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|My husband is a great fan of comic books so we always end up watching this type of movie.  I love the humor, special effects and the story.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Great book for a book club.  Great discussions were had.  The lives secrets can change, the secrets we keep will drive you mad
0143122010|5.0|Yes, the book is too long.  Yes, the book covers enough for at least 3 separate books. (The last third is a particularly  hard slog.)  But it is simply the most important book I, age 72, have ever read.  Why?  Because it is so massively documented that it should change our pessimistic world view of despair to one of encouraging optimism. Despite the bad headlines, we can and should rejoice in the long, proud, and improving sweep of human progress............go humanity!
B00735HGQ6|3.0|a likely pilgrmage that written for the screen, it felt like it had been written to sell as a movie rather than written to be a book
B005PK553C|5.0|It was awesome! Can't wait to view season 2! The cast was great and it was very well produced. Kudos!
B0079NQZLE|4.0|Thematically, the three movies deal with normal social order breaking down under different types of pressures.  In LOTF, the catalyst was an air crash leaving prep school boys to fend for themselves on an island.  Two camps emerged ... one responsible and one hedonistic.  The clashes were inevitable.  Prior normal rivalries, became exaggerated by a need to survive and a need to lead at all costs.<br /><br />Hunger Games' catalyst was from outside not within.  The abnormal social dynamic was a created organized event in a dystopian society.  The participants knew in advance what the challenges would be.  There was no previous tight social group among the participants.  That had to be created on the run literally.  Since this was a fight to the death, any social connections made were temporary, loose, and designed for personal survial not any need for restoring a social order.<br /><br />Battle Royale preceded Hunger Games by 6 years.  Unlike the other two movies based on books, BR was an original screenplay.  Culturally, it had some slight differences due to the Japanese inherent focus on a social order based on uniformity and conformity.  Oddly, BR is the most over the top of the three movies approaching a B class guilty pleasure movie.<br /><br />The classic social breakdown here is again from the outside.  A law is passed which requires picking a specific class in a specific school to have a fight to the death in an unknown setting.  But the catalytic breakdown itself is more like LOTF since there was an existing but seriously dysfunctional social order within the class.  Not surprising.  The BR law was the result of Japanese society rejecting growing violence among their young.<br /><br />BR moves fast and the confrontations are more graphic.  However, it has the feel of an anime' film in the level of stereotypical characters and the style of action.  I enjoyed this film not as a classic statement on anarchic societies but as a guilty pleasure movie.<br /><br />If you want a more serious film, watch LOTF, the original not the disappointing remake. I found the Hunger Games the Twilight version of social breakdown movies. Well crafted but just nothing that feels compelling for me to watch with interest.  Too syrupy.<br /><br />I'd recommend BR not that it is a great movie in the artiste sense but as that better than average action movie with some irony and more interesting characters albeit barely developed characters since the kills come fast.  It is noted that this is a top ten film in Japan and received great notoriety there when it opened.  While social conformity is important the idea of middle schoolers being chosen to kill each other off to somehow reduce violence levels among the worst school kids is particulalry offensive to their culture.  I find that view a bit dated. In reality, their biggest problem is not enough younger people in a very aging population.  More young not less is a goal. But so is a wish to retain the traditional respect for order, appreciation of their culture, education, and respect for elders. Possibly the shock was not so much about violent young as it was dealing with conflicting generational views between yound and old.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and better. Season 3 is the best season yet.....I can't wait for more episodes.
B007IK44CK|4.0|I had seen this in the movies.  It was a good tight story.  It was especially good this time as it was a solid distraction while exercising.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I don't watch much television but had heard great things about this series. So I started with season 1 on my kindlefire. I'm all the way through season 2 and will be so dissappointed when I am totally caught up with the current season and have no more to watch. It will be like finishing a great book and having to wait for the author to write another.

B00AYLTMMM|5.0|THis film is one of the best examples of how to address a very difficult subject.  With taste and dignity it presented the obstacles that had to be overcome to give this man , who was severely crippled, to have a meaningful sexual experience.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Who doesn't love a good romance story. That's no less true when it's between 2 dogs; and who doesn't always root for the underdog(pardon the pun). That's what happens when Lady gets caught by the dog catcher and one of the other dogs starts telling Lady about all of Tramp's other lady doggy friends. At first, she wants nothing more to do with this canine casanova; but when Tramp saves Lady and her owner's baby by killing a huge rat, she melts and of course forgives him. The family adopts him, Lady has 4 puppies and all live happily ever after-sigh.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I am enjoying the tale and the spirit with which Mark tackles and solves problems, but take issue with a major assumption the whole thing depends on, that is growing the taters in soil made from human waste. Anyone who has done any real gardening and/or composting knows this won't work, at least in this short term. Maybe a couple of years, but not a couple of months. As this excerpt from composting.com says, poop is not a good soil builder for many reasons, including the inhibition of growth of the healthy bugs you want in soil::<br /> their poop should NOT be added to a compost pile. Human poop also (even if someone is a vegetarian!) should never be added to a compost bin or pile. Both dogs and cats have organisms in their stomachs and can also have diseases in their poop that are harmful to the composting process and plant life, and ultimately humans. These diseases can get into the plants you eat, and should not be digested. Human poop can carry pathogens, diseases and organisms that can be extremely harmful.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Great read.  Love baseball, and it was really interesting.  Thought the book portrayed some interesting sides both to Billy Beane and his journey to the pinnacle of General Manager-dom.  Definitely a worthy read for anyone interested in statistical analysis behind baseball, but also has a nice storyline behind it :)  Recommended!

1597801585|3.0|This is a very bleak steampunk themed look at a dystopian world.  I like dystopian books normally, but I had a lot of trouble connecting with this one.  It had some good premises, but unrelatable characters.<br /><br />In the future the world's wealth is measured in calories.  Human bings have messed too far and now food is scarce, there are terminator genes in the food, and several mutated diseases and bacteria abound.  There are also new creatures that have been bio-engineered, even people.  Among them there is Anderson, a calorie man who is the Thai realm looking for a seed bank and the treasures it could hold within, to return to the big corporation he works for.  And then there is Emiko, a windup human who was left for trash when the Japanese business man who owned her decided he didn't want her anymore.  She makes her living hiding from the authorities who hate her kind and whoring herself out at a sleazy bar.  Together these two will cause upheaval in the city and start a new future that could be more frightening than the one they are already living in.<br /><br />Emiko, despite her degrading experiences and unique situations I couldn't really get a feel for.  I felt pity at times, but that's about it.  And I'm not sure if this is the reaction I was supposed to have.  After all, she is a wind-up and considered not a real person by society.  So maybe that was the author's intent.  Anderson was also not that great of a character.  I couldn't really feel out his motives.  Same with pretty much everyone else in this book.  None of them had clear cut thought processes or even inspired sympathy.  And finding a glimmer of hope in them was near impossible.<br /><br />I liked the different ideas presented in this book.  Certainly messing with the food system is a scary thing and even eerily similar to some of the experiments companies are doing already.  To add in changing the genetic makeup of humans too just seems logical.  But as for the actual telling of this story I was confused on so many things.  There are just so many unanswered questions on how the world got to the place it did in this book.  And then the plot itself is just so rushed around jumping between different characters that it was hard to follow.  I was never quite sure who was on who's side, doing what, and why.  And I should warn that there are a lot of graphic areas of this book involving sex, violence, murder, rape and sickness.  And it is explicit and described in-depth.<br /><br />Not really too my taste but it had a lot of unique concepts.  I'm sure someone who enjoys science and dystopians would enjoy it very much.  But I need to relate to the characters if I'm going to enjoy a book.<br /><br />The Windup Girl<br />Copyright 2009<br />359 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Just a great original show. Hope Sam become man of letters and Dean the muscle. Imagine one a DR No and the other a monster killer. Could really give show new feel.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|Unbelievable read.  Ludlum really hits the nail on the head, and wow, fantastic.  It took awhile to finish considering it's length, but it's well worth the time and effort.  Definitely recommendation
B004OZZ624|4.0|This movie is along the lines of the Harrison Ford hero thrillers. You root for Crowe all the way through, and you're never sure how it's going to end until the end.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a good game for kids. Has great graphics. Lets children who love animals care for them and train. We're stuck waiting because we don't want to buy gems. Only down point is if you don't purchase or earn gems thru other games you have to wait to play and can only advance so far each day.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Same as the second book I couldn't wait to get the last one. I got so engaged into the book I was hoping for a great ending! If anyone like to read theses kind of books, especially all the sexual parts it is a very easy reading. I'm usually not into these books but I thought the Trilogy was great!

B00571F26Y|5.0|This has been a fascinating and educational book and I feel armed with the right information to make food decisions that will give me optimum health.  I didn't realize how wheat affected my body until I gave it up.  No more arthritis or other aches and pains.  I also plan to talk to my doctor about coming off my cholesterol medications.  I also realized that I no longer have food cravings and am happy to eat 3 moderate meals a day, with nothing in between.  Unhealthy snacks and desserts no longer talk to me and that is a huge bonus!  I highly recommend this book.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|What a great game. I love it. It is intense and fun. I was pleasantly surprised when I first tried it. I recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't see my nose out of this book! I cant wait to read the second one. Definitely a must read for EVERYONE!!!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|When starting this story, I had reservations that it would have enough to keep my interest.  Was I wrong!  From start to finish, it was very exciting, with a lot of plausible science, and just the right amount of humor.  This may be the best sf book I have read in the last several years.  A very good bargain, I highly recommend.
B003I55BIA|5.0|Expected more love scenes, but it was a much more realistic loc  story. I enjoyed the give and take and the ending.
0743270754|5.0|This is an amazing look into the life and leadership of Abraham Lincoln.  Ms. Goodwin is masterful in her writing that allows the reader to envision the unfolding of events.  A wonderful read and especially wonderful to &#34;see&#34; it as played out by Daniel Day Lewis in &#34;Lincoln&#34;!

B004K58GSO|4.0|Yes, this one is pretty predictable, but in a great way, I think. This is one of the classics that helped define what IS predictable. Ranking it with other classics of the Duke, I would put &#34;Rio Bravo&#34; slightly above it, but this one definitely will always have a place in the top ten.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book!  Every time I thought I had it figured out, it would throw me another curve ball.  I really enjoyed this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time. If you haven't read it, you should! The movie isn't as good as the book, so if you have just seen the movie, read the book as well.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|There is nothing to say that hasn't already been said. It is the perfect battery app and the graphics are spectacular. I also used the free app for quite some and purchased the Pro version to thank the developers for their efforts and for providing a fully functional free app of such high quality.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I LOVE this app it is great! It made my math grades go up. I strongly recommend that  you get this app!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephen King knows how to do verbose. His prose is filled with flowing language and flowing words, and that's why he often straddles the boundary between commercial and literary fiction. This novel is the epitome of a Stephen King novel without the added element of horror. It flows from the first page to the last with effortless ease. Sure, he uses too many words, but it's how he uses these words that makes this, and his other novels, truly interesting and mostly entertaining.<br /><br />His take on time travel is a bit different than most, but until somebody perfects the art of jumping back in time, he made his version as realistic as any other I've ever read or seen. His portal was some unexplainable phenomenon, a hiccup in the universe. And based on the way the universe operates it's not entirely without merit.<br /><br />Jake Epping proved to be an interesting character. He's a somewhat naïve character, and frankly Al isn't much better. Neither fully appreciate or truly understand the ramifications of time travel, and that made me slightly angry. If you want to go back and change history, you should understand the consequences of your actions, and you should be prepared for any and all consequences that may result. Neither did. Sure, they thought they were doing a good thing, but there're no do overs for stupidity and naïvet&eacute;.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I rather enjoyed this novel, and it was Jake's relationship with Sadie that helped ground this time travel novel in reality. When it comes to relationships, Jake is certainly no expert, but he tried. He really, really did. Had he been honest from the beginning, he might have saved himself and Sadie heartache, but that would have cut out a chunk of this novel that even the master himself wouldn't have been able to put back.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator

B00821OX98|5.0|This is a solid show, one of the best efforts among the numerous post-apocalyptic dramas that have been produced in the last twenty years. Give me creepy space aliens over zombies and vampires every time.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The author has an interesting writing style, which does a great deal to develop the characters.  It is a good read with a surprising ending.  As a parent, though, I think the Dad would know his son better.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I live this game!!!  I never played the first one so I cant compare.  I can play this game for hours and now my kids and husband installed it on their devices and they are hooked too!!  GREAT GAME!!
B000FC10WU|2.0|I was disappointed in this one.  Other Agatha Christie  books are more complicated and keep you guessing.  This one was not that interesting.  The characters were dull.  Action was limited.

B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading The Hunger Games, I tried (unsuccessfully) to distract myself with something else to read  before going on to this one.

030758836X|5.0|Can't decide what I loved more about this book - the author's insight into human nature, the black humor she mines there, her ability to manipulate our opinion of the characters like a puppet master or the wickedly clever plot. All I know is I loved everything about Gone Girl, including the ending - organic, inevitable. Aesop would be proud.

1936608898|5.0|It all made sense.  This is the first book to \\"connect all of the dots\\"; how does what we eat make us feel.  I would recommend this book to anyone ready to make an eating change for the better.
B007SGM084|2.0|These books were like a Harlequin Romance....on steroids! Young innocent virgin woman meets older, wealthy, sardonic playboy and they lived happily ever after. I only read all 3 because I bought the trilogy, took me weeks to read, it did not draw me in.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|love this app on my phone and pc but it has some bugs on kindle. please fix the terrible spell check for Pc and list the upgrade price in the app and I would pay for premium.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I found this app to be very fun. I enjoy making people and showing them to friends and family. They do the same thing. It is my opinion thatanyone who is reading this review should buy the app.
B005QUQRE2|3.0|The acting was excellent.  The story idea was undeniably thought provoking.  I'm happy to have this among my collection.  I was prepared for a serious sci-fi adventure loaded with special effects, and the only special effect is the other Earth.  In terms of holistic filmmaking -- they nailed it:  The character development was believable; the diegesis peculiar but interesting.  It's not often that a film can be measured strictly by artistic merit alone, but all of the Human elements came together seamlessly.  I desperately wanted to know more about the 'other' Earth and was angry that the story did not attempt to physicalize that longing until the last 5 seconds.  Scholastically, the film deserves a 5, but subjectively, I'm disappointed.
B004V73FGE|5.0|For the record, it was great to see the old 1982 film have some closure. This was an awesome film to watch with my son. The imagination is a great tool. The film captures the old and the new.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Best musical ever made and even better in Blu Ray. I love watching Donald O'Connor dance sequence in this movie. A must for any fan of musicals
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Like the games but I can't lie<br />some are a little  tougher than I thought they were be. But practice makes perfect! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app. Although I do recommend you to get the 2nd one. But for your information don't forget about the first one. I love it.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Relaxing with just the right degree of challenge.  This game could be played by just about any age group (3-83).  The controls are super simple even allowing you to simply tilt or spin the controller to get good results.  Point forward to walk, steer left to walk left, etc.  My favorite is flower petal.  What a vivid imagination this design team has.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love this game because it can be a challenge if you are playing against your time.  Love the way the cube turns to give you more options.  Good game
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is amazing well written and acted. Highly recommend it. Deserves all the awards it is getting. Can't wait to start season 3.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|iv been playing it for a half a year now and I love it when my babysitter showed me it and I found it on my kindle and I love it its awesome
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The beginning was too much detail for me. But I enjoyed it none the less. I thought it was absolutely adorable
B005PK56TA|4.0|Outlandish, creepy, dramatic, and fun to watch. Some story lines stretched way too thin but overall a good first season.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Enjoy matching  the characters.  Good game while watching TV.  Enjoy playing it and think everyone would enjoy the game.  Have fun.
B0024F08UG|5.0|We have just recently converted to a Blu ray player will not go back to DVD. This movie is a must with the special effects even though it was made in the 60's.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved reading this book, and I finished it in a day. I liked the format and enjoyed the characters. I believe another reason I loved it so much is because, I myself am a wallflower.<br />You should definitely read this.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I enjoy this type of entertainment. This was done well. I highly recommend it. Really like it in this format as there are no commercials!
0756655307|4.0|This Encyclopedia is quite extensive and its very nice for somebody like me that isnt a huge fan. However they do tend to brush over some characters that perhaps should have more time dedicated to them.
B008Y78M60|4.0|Enjoyed the actors and the acting, but need to do some more research about the story itself.  If this is factual, it would not surprise me, knowing a little about the times and the moods surrounding the murder of this president.  It's a bit on the dark side, but treating this story would have to be.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game, is another favoite, of my grands. It's time Mimi, tried it out. Thankyou!  They, rated it high, so I did, also.
B004EWFUQY|2.0|This diet worked for some of my friends, but if you are already very active or not trying to lose much weight it does not work and you end up hungry ALL day.  I'm getting tones the right way now with adding resistance exercises and 6 small high protein low carb meals a day. It is working. Dukan is probably best suited for inactive or very overweight people.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|You get a more in depth look at the decision making at the Athletics than the movie indicated.  All in all a good look at the revolution in baseball management.
B007M45PMU|4.0|It is good to hear new groups bringing and new edge to Alt music. This CD is a breath of fresh air. It is NOT carbon copy music like much of the current selection of certain genres.
B006ZS4FE8|5.0|Bought this for my ten year old for Christmas. We both loved it. She spent three straight hours putting it together and the only comments were her telling us which book of instructions she was on. She's huge into horses and Legos so this was a great combination. She then spent the next couple of days playing with them (I'm sure it would have been longer if little brothers weren't starting to break it apart). For anyone who hasn't bought the friends version before, they're fabulous for girls, and just like regular Legos that can be mixed and matched. We have bins full and the only difference is the color scheme. I was a bit hesitant because this was the largest, most expensive set we've bought so far, but it was worth the money.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I chose my rating, for this is a favorite of my grandchildren. I believe they want grandma to try it out, so I Will.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down, && a love story you can't even guess the ending. This book personally hit home for me!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It is an interesting story, but then goes on to promote the author's foundation.  I liked the first 75 percent of the book.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This movie started off very slow, but once it got going it was very interesting. The ending is a bit disappointing, but if any movies follow, I'm sure they will be good together.
034580404X|5.0|Very interesting series, to say the least.  The writer has a very good grip on reality and fiction, not to mention description.
B00A757EFW|5.0|My granchildren loaded this game on. It is one of teir favoites, so grandma, is going to give it a try.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good game and keep up the great work! I hope you keep on updating the game into better versions!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love it, so interactive! Its just like taking care of a real horse!(I should know XD) The only problem i had was getting it to load up the first time it glitched out and did a black screen half the time, I had to shut down twice to get it to work (I could get out of the game but i thought shutting it down would refresh)
B0095P3ULC|3.0|I loved Megan Fox in the first two, so I had set myself for disappointment. I also avoided watching it until now. It was much better than I expected. It held my attention the whole time, but with that much action it's hard not to. The dark side of the moon had everything you could want in a movie: comedy, action, desire, and teary-eyed moments. When the autobots said goodbye and walked into the shuttle, I felt tears prick my eyes - though I knew they would be back!<br />I will say though, that as part of the transformers movies go, it wasn't my favorite. And other than characters, there wasn't much to tie it to the past movies. The things that happened had barely or not not even mentioned in previous movies, so this movie, could have very well just been a stand alone movie.<br />With this being said I liked the movie and recommend it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent series.  if you are undecided, as i was, just watch the first 3 episodes..... you will fall in love with it
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love this game, it is very hard to put down. I would really like to see the valentines edition for the kindle then I would give it a five star rating. I Love the variety of dragons and features.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I live in Vermont, so I find the idea of this game really cool. Love it to pieces. Definitely worth the 3 bucks!<br />.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great characters, great acting, great cinematography and lush settings.  I was late to get on this bandwagon but now I'm enjoying the ride.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT &#34;FRINGE&#34; 1ST SEASON THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE EPISODE THAT WAS NOT INTERESTING,KEEP UP THE SAME FORMAT.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best shows I've watched...ever!  I just can't wait for season 3 to be released!!  Hopefully I don't have to wait too long!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever  one little problem with  the update one month after the update all of my world's we're gone
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I'm a big fan of historical books and movies and your showing of &#34;The Tudors&#34; is just what I need.  Even though they might have taken artistic liberty with some issues, it's still very well done.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was well written and interesting, but I don't enjoy reading words that I choose not to use in my own conversations.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This story was so heartwarming and sweet.  I loved how the horse was telling the story.  I really enjoyed it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Definitely better than average book. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys something a bit suspenseful but be warned these people are not your average couple.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This great game is fantastic to play on a kindle fire and a iPad. A kindle fire edition games are the best games on the kindle fire tablet
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved every minute of it. Such heartbreaking, but also inspiring story. Great insight into the dynamics of a family and mental illness.
1439152802|5.0|\\"Secret Keeper\\" is the third Kate Morton novel I've read. She has to be one of the best storyweavers of our time. I am amazed at how she takes you in and out of the different characters perspectives and travels back and forth in time, but never loses the reader. I was mesmerized by this story and it's haunting undertone. Another winner for Kate Morton!
B004LROUNG|5.0|I like anything by John Grisham.  He is such a good writer that you don't want to put the book down and this book was no exception.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this game on my kindle fire and I thought it was amazing I would want to see a second one
B00785P2QC|4.0|It . Is cool wow so cool<br />I'm pretty good Scandinavians hahaha haha<br />Do you like waffles hahaha<br /><br />Wow this is a good game
0618871713|5.0|I cannot recall did I buy a used copy? This book look brand new. If I purchased a used copy and received this new book what can I say. I love it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Don't start this series if you don't want to be hooked. I would give the whole series a 10 if I could.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I love to read Nicholas Sparks' books.  He makes them easy to follow and I liked the storyline in this one.  I cried at the end.
B005723JSQ|5.0|It was a very humorous and great feel book.I laughed out loud a couple of times.It's one of her finest works.Superb.A Must Read !!! 5 stars all the way.

B00AKKTDJY|3.0|I don't like that the grandma only has 1 table to cook with. She can only make one food at a time
B001PJRAUS|5.0|A great modern version of the original. This is for mature audiences due to language and situations-no nudity just sexual references. A modern woman dreams of going to Jane austen's time and she does. Very good movie.
B0048WQDIE|4.0|I read this book because I read it in high school and never got to finish it.  I wanted to read it again and get to the end this time.  Funny and a little irreverent. Yossarian lives!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I wish that this game was the regular one not the Rio one overall I liked it though....Really good graphics
0345803485|5.0|You get to see a glimpse of who Christian Grey really is and how is love escapade with Anastasia turns out.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Excellent dramatization of the novel of the same name by James Lee Burke, featuring the protagonist of this and other books by the same author, the tormented, former alcoholic detective Dave Robicheau.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|Fantastic British family series. Great values. Acting and cast are great. Scenery is beautiful. I love series that go back in time and this one does a great job of making life back then very realistic.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Recommend this game, it is very addicting. Does not take long to get animals. The free items everyday is nice as well.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|Kids loved it! Funny and Entertaining. It really kept their attention (especially my 4 1/2 year old son) and they've watched it numerous times.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app! I named my horse after my horse. It's a great game and lots of fun for all ages. I definitely recommend it.
B001BANK32|5.0|The SHINING is one of my favorite movies.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I could not put down.
B000244FDW|5.0|A very old version of story but I still liked it. It is interesting if you love romance and old fashioned values and if you love Jane austen.
B000OVLINI|2.0|This book couldn't keep my interest and was a bit long. Not one I'd recommend. Didn't need all the characters which became confusing.
B005COO1X6|4.0|This was my first book I ever ordered when I got my kindle. As always Stephen King wrote agreat book. I didn't know at the time it was a short story, so I was dissapointed when it ended so early.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A sophisticated soap opera in the style of a Jane Austin novel. The story is interesting. The characters are intriguing, well developed and multi dimensional.  It is very well acted
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Wow the writing on this show always exceeds my expectations! What can I say, if you are a doctor who fan this season is one of the best. Highly recommended.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a good app for kids. My daughter likes puzzles, so this app keeps her entertained in the car on long trips.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|My daughter forgot to pick up a copy from the library for one of here classes. Very convenient to get on Amazon and download it. Thanks Amazon!
B0030F5W5K|1.0|I tried<br /><br />To watch this movie six or seven times. It would not stream for me. I worked with amazon to resolve this problem, it did not work.  I cancelled amazon prime.
0689835604|5.0|Perfect book for little ones!!  Cute pictures with great captions make this a great &#34;read to&#34; book for babies.  A good gift for learning too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game. The fact that it is free is a real bonus. Everyone should try it out.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is a really great game I play it 247 I love it. It is so addicting to me and maybe even everyone who  has it and u can get really high scores. So buy it just do it is so fun take look at it just get it!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Highly recommend. This series is so interesting, you sit on the edge of your seat awaiting the next show. If you are looking for a gift, the entire collection of Downton Abbey is it!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Christmas movies don't get any better than this.  Great plot with a twist.  The ending is so satisfying.  It's the perfect blend of reality and fantasy.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Funny. Made me laugh. Poor Rowley gets abused by Greg. I was happy that Rowley got the girl in the end!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Sometimes when you see couples that publicly show affection to each other all the time it doesn't always mean things are as they appear.
044654759X|3.0|Having read other books by Nicholas Sparks I was looking forward to reading \\"Safe Haven.\\" However, this book reminded me of a Harlequin romance novel ... flat characters with no dimension, wooden dialogue and a preposterous ending. The pace was good and I got caught up in the mystery. But the plot was so predictable! Whoever wrote \\"Sleeping With the Enemy\\" should sue Sparks for plagiarism. Except for the addition of the 2 kids, it was identical to that Julia Roberts film. I hope Sparks' next work is more original.
B0063IH60K|5.0|NICE simple game. Easily pass the time and try to beat the clock to better your score. Would definitely recommend.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Easy to read. Not gory. His wife's small  chapters were insightful and added a nice change of pace in the read.<br />After all he went thru to be murdered in Texas  not at war ,stayed in the back of my mind  thru it all.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great puzzle app would buy more like it, easy to work at whatever level, HD pictures are great. It is fun to play.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Anyone who read the first two books in this trilogy does not need a review of the last one.  I write this to add reflection on the series finding myself on the last page. It may be fiction but the lessons are as old as time. Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Fun game to play better than the other ones because all the birds have a new twist. Good game to play.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love this app i do t even use pinterest on my computer anymore this is way better and so much better then the app they have for apple products... i am a pinterest addict and this app makes everything so easy. my app hardly ever crashes and its super fast i love it even though its free... its definitely worth money and i would have totally paid for it if i had to... :)
B008XBASVY|4.0|I am a big fan of Chris Colfer and had to get a hold of this book. From the moment I started reading I couldn't put it down. He is an absolute genius with his wit and sarcasm, and Carson is a very relatable character. This is definitely a new favorite of mine.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|THIS IS AN AWESOME GAME AND BETTER TJAN THE OLD ONE!!!! I LOVE IT SO MUCH AND THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT!!! DOWNLOAD IMMEDIATLY!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The title pretty much says it all. Every chance he gets to play his kindle fire he plays this game.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was was very well written and totally believable! I've heard of the exact same experiences a number of times, but coming from a neurosurgeon makes it more scholarly.
B0081336FO|5.0|Discovered this series through the recommendation of a family member.  Really impressed with the writing in this clever take of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle book series.  I highly recommend it to you.
B00B7XGFO4|4.0|I am a big fan of the novel JANE EYRE and have been since I discovered it in the sixth grade.  I remember watching this film version with George C. Scott and Susannah York on TV when I was a kid and liking it and I was delighted to get a chance to view it again as an adult.<br /><br />Susannah York in this version is both too old and too beautiful to be Jane as described in the novel but her portrayal convincingly creates  the kind of woman with whom a man like Rochester could fall totally in love.  And George C. Scott really does make a great Rochester.  Aside from Scott's  great acting chops his looks and age are much more in line with the Rochester of the book then say Timothy Dalton or Toby Stephens.  Actually I still like the Jane Eyre mini-series with Dalton the best but this is a very decent attempt at capturing the beloved story on film.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Coming off of A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows is simply disappointing. Many of the core characters are not included in this book. While Martin introduces chapters from the point of view of characters such as Brienne of Tarth and Queen Cersei - certainly interesting characters to get to know better - he omits favorites such as Tyrion and Daenerys Targaryen. There also seems to be a lot of history of Westeros and flashbacks of characters - which slow the stories down immensely. That being said, I still devoured the book in less than a week.
1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs was a brilliant and revolutionary genius.  Other reviewers have eloquently examined the high (and low) points of this amazing biography.  All I can add is that I was a huge fan, I admire how Mr. Jobs changes our lives, and I found this book well-written and thoroughly.  He had a perfect blend of technical savvy and design aesthetics.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Discovered this series through the recommendation of a family member.  Really impressed with the writing in this clever take of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle book series.  I highly recommend it to you.
B005PK56TA|3.0|I'm kind of embarrassed to admit I watched the entire first season of AMERICAN HORROR STORY on my Kindle but I did.  It's gory, over the top trash but well enough made that  I couldn't stop watching an episode every week or so until I came to the end.  It's full of disturbing images and ideas and definitely not for the sensitive or young.  AMERICAN HORROR STORY (season one)reminded me quite a bit of the old DARK SHADOWS soap opera from the 60's and 70's only much much more graphic.  Talented actress Jessica Lange is great in her portrayal of the manipulative, puzzling Constance and her participation in the series adds some much needed respectability to the entire endeavor.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Whatever I couldn't imagine the fear you have felt in your life. Thanks for sharing your memories as many of us had followed your story in the news.<br /><br />I will admit this book is a little hard to read due to the repeated thoughts and sentences.  I did enjoy the photos as it helped with the timeline of events.
B008HK3XYK|2.0|I won't advise anyone to get it.  I will tell exactly how I would like to have. It doesn't sit right and no place for the re-charge to store.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|Lovely
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Why did I wait so long? This is the best book I have read in a long time. Read it in 4 days. Could not put it down.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are beautiful and the game is creative. It keeps you on your toes with unexpected turns and obstacles. I swear it even speeds up.
B008Q08PIK|4.0|I've seen it beforebut I likebothe stars.  Whatever movies they are in, I always watch it.  They are nice to look at, also a cute couple and good actors.
1451695195|5.0|Trying to explain the unexplainable in terms that a human can understand must be nearly impossible. If there really is a heaven that's the way it should be. No question Dr Alexander had a remarkable experience and He makes a strong but not totally convincing argument that it cannot be explained by current knowledge of the brain. Very reassuring to me is that his experience of heaven makes sense. I hope and now have some faith there is a heaven
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have been reading Stephen King since I was fourteen and love almost all of his books. This book was done very well. I have always wondered what would happen if I could go back in time and change one event. What would happen to the rest of the world if it happened different? While I will not spoil this book for any who have not read it, I didn't like the way things turned out. I was actually on the verge of tears at the unfairness of it, while understanding why it had to be that way. I cannot compare this book to any other King novel as it stands on its own. I loved Jake's character and what he had to go through. All I can say is, read this book!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is well worth your time.  I didn't think I would enjoy Downton Abby but had to give it a try because all my friends are watching it... Glad I did.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was an amazing story about friendship, love and heartbreak.  One of the best books I've ever read.  I couldn't put the book down because it was just so good.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The movie was hilarious! The soundtrack was great, and Fat Amy had me in stitches.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addictive and entertaining,i think you'll like it too! I love this app because of how fun it is!
B004LZFWJO|4.0|I wish there wasnt a cap on the scoring. I purchased the app for the purpose of trying to clear the entitre board...which I haven't done yet.
B00821OX98|5.0|its a great way to watch a series commercial free.  i like si fi  stuff  and this has a good story line with it.
B001F12J0C|5.0|...I would take the trilogy to a desert island. While I give all the Bourne movies 5 stars, the Bourne Supremacy is my favorite. I forgot to add...the music is also awesome!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because is so adventureous and accelerating.idk if dispelled that right. Ut this I a great and u wont be dissapointed
B008TMA1LY|3.0|its a lot of fun but the prices finally are ridiculous.  I payed for a few coins and characters but its just too expensive to keep up! they need a bundle or something. its a lot of fun though
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Viewers will gain a greater understanding of the alternate universe and its characters. Plot and character development is fantastic and you will be left wanting to watch the next episode.
B0012CH350|5.0|Fits perfect. You cannot go wrong. It is keeping all the rain and stuff off of the BBQ...better than a garbage bag!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids and hubby are addicted to this game. It high paced and fun so it keeps them entertained for hours.
B008XKT9FG|4.0|Very entertaining movie. My wife and I were completely taken by surprise by the end.  Helen Hunt's performance was amazing and she looked terrific!!!
1594487154|5.0|This book is filled with valuable information on motivating or &#34;moving&#34; others. I am an Assistant Professor in a Physical Therapy Program and I have found a many valuable tools for moving my students. For example, I am planning on using the &#34;E&#34; drawing exercise from the Attunement chapter  to establish working groups for Gross Anatomy Laboratory. This should give the class more cohesive groups and limit the sameness that often occurs with self group formation. I also intend to use the listening section with the students to help them develop better listening skills with patients. And the pitch section describes exercises and strategies that my students can use to 'move' their patients into compliance. A wonderful read and invaluable resource for anyone who needs to move people or who teaches others to 'move' people. I have bought copies for friends and I hope the word spreads. Thank you Mr Pink!
B006L0A5P8|4.0|A friend of mine who is not very computer savvy recommended this product to me a while back because he said it was so easy to use.  I used to do tech support for a living, so I wasn't worried about being able to use it, but I loved the idea of having a tool that would finally let me do what I'm &#34;supposed&#34; to do in terms of having different, strong passwords for everything.  It's a great program, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of one tiny bug and an interface that is sometimes a tiny bit hard to work with.  But for the average person, they'd probably never deal with that one bug.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a great story with just enough spice to hold the interest.  Mr. Sparks writes SO well!  Loved the lack of bad language!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is so cool!!! I love this app because i love horses so these people have combined my favorite animal in a fun game tht everyone will probably enjoy.
B00005ATQF|5.0|I did not have any issues with this movie at all, worked fine... Love the movie also by the way
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Newer iMacs no longer support FireWire directly, but this adaptor allows you to connect to FireWire devices without problem.  When I plugged in my BlueRay burner, it just worked.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I bought this because I was having inconsistency between my screen and prints from my Canon Pro9000 mk II.  the colormunki was easy to setup and I now have much greater consistency.  I was also able to calibrate my wife's computer so we now have uniform screens.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|I enjoyed the book and the attachment the two people had. It's kind of an overdone theme right now with twilight though. But the writing was good and it kept me interested. And it was a good ending.
B002RV01QI|4.0|Enya has the ability to make me smile and lift my mood. This CD does that. Enjoy for yourself, really.
B002R5HR70|4.0|Overall It's a good and entertaining movie although a little cheesy at points.  Contains a good combination action, suspense and drama.
B00ACKU1NY|3.0|I thought this app would be a good way to access France24 (English) for news from a European prospective. I had previously watched France24 via a digital channel (over the air) and although the French broadcaster is &#34;left-leaning&#34; it is not as biased as the USA networks. The app does indeed provide access to France24 along with many other video providers, I've found the service is often &#34;not available&#34;or so pixilated as to preclude viewing. So my review while not negative is mixed. In the interval France24 has been restored as an over-air channel such that I'm less likely to use this app. I wish them well as a work in progress.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|This Google app made it harder to search than the regular search page.it was terrible.I deleted it after using it twice.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|New to this series, but completely hooked after watching a few episodes!  Our whole family watches and enjoys the show.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Frustrating. Didn't work.  Thought it would work like my droid phone. Only shows the weather in LA. Don't bother with it.
1430308001|5.0|My young son started playing chess and I wanted to be able to play the other dads at meetups without embarrassing myself. I knew I needed to do some reading. After [[ASIN:0553263153 Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess]] I wasn't sure what to get. I bought this, read half, then started on [[ASIN:1890085103 Silman's Complete Endgame Course: From Beginner To Master]] while I finished Vols. I & II of Predator. Best decision I ever made.<br /><br />The book is clearly written and does not require you to read long stings of algebraic notation. His book recommendations for further study are excellent as well. Be sure to solve practice problems to drill these tactics into your head.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife just started watching this series about 2 weeks ago.  She was instantly hooked and loves the show.  Storyline is solid and the acting is excellent.  5 stars.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I try to open the game and it just wont let me play.I install it over &amp; over,I play a litte, then exit.Once I try to play it again it wont open. I know I'm not the only one because I've asked others.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|The film features a marvelous adventure Chris McCandless, a young man that died in the summer of 1992 in Alaska. Compared to the book, the film is very accurate. Even minor details fit the bill. A few names were changed and a few interactions left out, but overall it did a wonderful job of depicting all the things the book covered. They threw in some very important quotes that were used in Chris McCandless' letters to the people he met in his journeys. Very inspiring film.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|You know doesnt matter if it is 1 to 3 its transformers an Im biased an will love it. Have seen probably 12 times already. got to love the graphics and wanting to know what else is next.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|Don't know why, but I was't too crazy about this app. The app loaded well looks good and works well but I still prefer looking at Linkedin on my computer.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was beautiful!  Not sure what else to say :) Its a good read for sure. The end brought tears to my eyes!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Mediocre. It is just like all the other free games. Gems are hard to get,  it takes a long time to get coins and every thing is for gems or lots of coins. But it is a good game if you only play it once in awhile. But since it is free it is worth it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read to the end. I would recommend this book to all who love a great mystery. Really makes you think  about human nature.
B00867GKIK|5.0|Great storyline. My wife cries when watching these kind of movies. I tried to convince her it's not for real-just an animated movie. Love the 3D and Bluray details. I am loading up my 3D library. This is one of my faverates along with Avatar-Hugo-Legend of The Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole.  Check out this site for 3D reviews [...]
B008AK8FHM|5.0|What a wonderful experience Dr. Alexander has courageously shared with our world.  Once I started this book, I could hardly stop reading.  It made me cry because this good man told of a Supreme Power without the trappings of religious dogma, ritual, and doctrine.  As I firmly believe that God, everyone's God, is greater than any religion of any time and place, this book brought me comfort.  I suppose anyone could pick it apart for style, or structure....who cares.  Read this book to expand the heart.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you might think that I am lieing but I am not I found lava in minecraft pocket edition. It is awesome and almost inposible to find it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of  my top 5 books of all time (and I read a lot of books).  This book made me think, made me feel and changed the way I see the world!  I will teach this book soon, but this book is definitely not just for teens. I have recommended it to 5 people (I read it twice since January 5th) and they all loved it.<br />READ THIS!
B0016BPWNM|4.0|I really liked this movie back in the early 80s. For a 30 year old movie-WOW!! I'm old, just out of high school. This movie still has me Laughing. Even better ion blueray-get it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Romantic, sweet story.  A very good read.  The characters are very real.  Once I started I could not put down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is amazing.<br />I love the game.Iove the choices you can get.Amazing amazing amazing amazing and amazing.wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow and wow
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The previews looked great! I am a huge Denzel Washington fan, but I have to say, this was a huge disappointment. It dragged on, the plot involving the woman was needless, and I found myself wanting the movie to end. I would not recommend this, unless it was for rent at $1.99, but for $4.98, I wish I would have spent it on something else.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Awesome TV show. Great story line. Good acting all around. Great special effects. I watched both seasons in 2 days after discovering this show. Now I can't wait for season 3 to start this summer!
B00821OX98|4.0|Worth watching if you like science fiction/disaster and good character development.  My wife and I enjoyed it.  Wish there were more episodes.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I have read quite a few of Jodi's books and I like them all.  They keep me interested enough to not want to put the books down.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|the bulk of my note are related to a technical profession so I do not care if evermotes wants to us my notes for ads or what not.  In brief I put only very public data in.  The app itself is handy and easy to use on many platforms.  Integration with aneroid cameras is slick, and the dictation feature works well.  use tags liberally to ease finding data and you will have a better experience.  I also recommend using the browser plugins on concert with the device apps.  Great app, just pit your private business elsewhere.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|If you've read &#34;born to run&#34; and you've become addicted to the barefoot thing (I was bit by the bug) then this is the next book to read.  It's not just about barefoot running, but it's about learning about your body and pushing it to the limit.  If you eat hamburgers and french fries every day your body will not go to the limits with you and this book talks about Scott Jurek's experience and how he became one of the best ultra marathonners (50+ miles) in the world.
B00006AW63|5.0|This movie was excellent!  I was so surprised that I liked it, I sure didn't expect to!  Not only did it have some good drama in it, but my son and I ended up laughing so hard we could hardly breathe at times!<br /><br />Glenn Close did such an excellent job!  Her part alone deserves five stars!<br /><br />This is actually going on my list of movies to own!  It's great for a good laugh.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I love these books.  I am 38 years old and they still spark the imagination.  I recommend books by Morgan 100%.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game! I play this game all the time! It's very addicting! The kids play it all the time.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Give myself 5 minutes to write review, not a common task in my schedule.<br />Scientists meet in Australia and blossom in New York; sounds familiar.<br />Six years in the making and every minute worthwhile.<br />Read post-op and stitches still in place, but just.<br />More twists than a good murder story, more laughs and resonating chuckles than any recent film, more food for thought than eat, pray, love etc.<br />Unlikely premise for a long book, but wish it was much longer.<br />Will share with my friend, lend to my therapist, all in one go.<br />Minimalist text works well for Graeme, will need to attend his workshop.<br />Five minutes over; must improve typing skills before doing this again.<br /><br />The first two reviews here say it well.  This is a wonderful book that is easy to read out loud.  The characters stay with you for a long time after putting the book down.  It is great on a second read, as there are so many clever innovations in the plot and text.<br /><br />But most of all, the main characters are delightful, the pace is just right and there is much that I learnt about genetics and myself along the way.  Have no doubt, most will enjoy this book and, I suspect, slip it to that son who sometimes despairs of the best way to find a lifelong partner.<br /><br />Little wonder that the book won a major prize in Victoria for the best unpublished manuscript in 2012.<br /><br />As a forecaster, I would invest in the stocks of Text Publishing who are translating the book into 30 languages.  The book has universal appeal.<br /><br />Total 12 minutes - will have to adjust tomorrow's schedule to make up.  Please empathise with me!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is infinite. I really connected with the characters and enjoyed every word. The pains of growing up and greater realizations than yourself.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Truly a great show, watched it all in one weekend. DO IT!!! You will be dissapointed that there was never a second season..
B006OKOZGU|5.0|Great image and wonderfull Hitchcock classic movie with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly at is best!The restoration made for the bluray edition is pristine
B00499NHLC|5.0|I was surprised by Sherlock. I was expecting it to be very dry, as a BBC drama, but it turned out to be engaging and daring, with the characters especially. The smartest thing they have done with the characters is to not portray them as likeable or popular, but to make them flawed in very grand and fascinating ways. It made for a refreshing take on the genre and the character. I highly recommend that if you are curious about this show you should definitely give it a chance, you just might love it like I do.
1568363842|5.0|... whether it's at NYU's SCPS or the Japan Society, both of which choose this book for their spring classes.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|It's an excellent book I'm amazed about the way that the plot revealed page by page every answer of questions that seems to appear logically in your head as you are reading.... can't wait to read the second one!
B001JOIEZ4|4.0|Great soundtrack. I think it was better than the following soundtracks for the rest of the movies. I would definatly suggest it to my friends. Infact several have already asked for it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 6 year old GD and my 2 year old GS seems to like this.  I got the 6 year old a Kindle for Christmas and she's read several books and also has &#34;purchased&#34; several games...this is the one she seems to play.  Her 2 year old brother seems to like this too.<br />I'd recommend this for a 6 year old, with TIME LIMITS!  ;)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|thats all just wow! love this show totally wonderful tv show. Its a great thing to watch with the whole family.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book was full of adventure, mystery, excitement, and laughter. You should defiantly read this book. SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS RULES!!!!!!!!
030758836X|1.0|Started well, but after the second chapter I hated everyone in the book, didn't care what happened to them.  Ending was a sucker-punch.  A waste of money for me.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|My 6 year old GD wanted to watch this movie, but I enjoyed it as much as she did!<br />2 year old also seemed to like the movie.
B005HESLUA|5.0|For soo many years we have been occupied with re-runs of old star trek with james t kirk...now a days with more younger minds actors and high tech sets we are invited to go forth on these excellent science fiction journeys with even more places and aliens to explore.Ive been watching star trek since my youth and still enjoy the adventures star trek has to offer.
B004S5C8WG|5.0|gripping with twists and turns intriguing and compelling. a novel which explores legal processes whilst considering baseless influence and mistrust
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was truly a treat to read.  To me it was much more of what science fiction should be- not shoot 'em up lasers or starships doing battle, but real, futuristic, science-based writing within a compelling story.  More than once I found myself cheering for our hero, and more than once I was literally laughing out loud; all this and a great story.  I have been telling every sci-fi fan I know to read this book.  Pick it up- you will not be sorry!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I was so touched by this book that I myself wrote my own slam and read it at my 40 th birthday party! It's a great way to express yourself on a deeper level than you thought possible..
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Im hooked on this series. No regrets on this purchase. Shipped quicker than expected. This is worth the money.lower price than the video store
B00843TZJM|1.0|I did not get a chance to see or listen to the contents of this disc. It loaded in my player and would go to the main menu , but would not play. I did notice on the main menu it had no choice of audio output, my system will automatically determine what format to play it in and it was 5 channel stereo. I would have thought this Blu ray would have been DTS or 5.1 surround. Cant comment on sound quality because it wouldn't play.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|I love Les Miserables having seen the show 3 times. I cannot believe the way this fantastic musical has been destroyed in the name of \\"art\\". The intention that this should be a raw recording is claptrap! If they used actors that can sing, then they would have had a chance to pull this off, but for me it is Russell Crowe that absolutely ruins this. Terrible casting choice, but he should have backed out when he realized that he cannot cope with the challenging score. Not only is his singing bad, his acting, something he is generally good at, is awful!  Others have correctly commented on the omission of critical songs (e.g. Hear the People Sing) from this \\"highlights\\" recording is poor judgment. Unfortunately, this recording is selling well, probably due to a high number of first time listeners, but i strongly recommend buying the original cast recording or the 10 year anniversary recording as they are far superior to this poor attempt.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great read! Enjoyed the first two books and had to keep reading to find out what happens next! Can't wait to watch the movies!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This was good. If you like Stephen king stuff you would enjoy this. It kept us on the edge of our seats.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|I was looking forward to a more typical Clint Eastwood movie, but this felt more like a Hallmark show. I liked it but not a lot.
B008Q08PIK|5.0|Roman Holiday is a wonderful old movie,a romantic story of a princess who wants to escape her responsibilites.  The movie is in black and white, which was a surprise since everything is colorized now.  This is defintely worth watching.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Well done show.  Well worth watching. Great characters, stories and you really get caught up in their lives. Make sure you see the movie, Serenity, afterwards.
0765325950|5.0|This was the last installment of the wheel of time and I absolutely loved it. I have been reading the series since the nineties and it is great to get to the\\"end\\"of the story. I had a feeling about half way through the series that Robert Jordan might pass away and the series would be left unfinished but luckily Brandon Sanderson stepped up to the plate and finished it with flying colors. Is it exactly the way Mr Jordan would have finished it? Nope sure isn't, but the feel of the story was consistent with what would have come from Mr Jordan. So, thank you to both authors for creating a world where we got to see Rand, Perrin, Mat, and many others grow to fight off the dark one and let the wheel continue. RIP Mr Jordan, and to you Mr Sanderson, we expect big things out of you.
B000002VMD|4.0|recorded before Bobby ruined her life s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s
B003JTHXOK|5.0|So good. Read it in one sitting! Makes you cry at the end with an unexpected twist of events. Nicholas Sparks never disappoints.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Loved the Bourne series, Can't compare this to the Robert Ludlum series, I will still continue to buy Bourne movies just for the heck of it, that is if they continue to make. Product came on time in mint condition
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book was so interesting to read. I feel like I now have the secret to a happy marriage! A must-read for all in a relationship.
1616550414|5.0|I absolutlely love this Zelda book! I bought it mainly because of the official detailed Zelda timeline; which I was surprised when they announced that there were 3 seperate timelines after Ocarina of Time, which was back in 2011 the Zelda creators said this. But I also bought this book for the unreleased & cool concept art from all of the games; which is indeed cool looking & awesome! I love that it's a hardback book too! I've been a HUGE Zelda fan since A Link to the Past up to Skyward Sword; & I love this book! :D
B007SGLZP8|4.0|He gets really innovative in this book, there are things he does that you  never expect. In some of his<br />books he is very predictable, but in this one he is loaded with surprises. Really enjoyed the book.
B006FE83UE|5.0|What can you say... Classic!, timelless, everyone should watch this.  Lttile deep fro your kids but still a great lesson. A must for your DVD libary.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is a lot more detailed than the last one. I like the new graphics. My girls play this game a lot.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Typical Tommy Lee Jones movie - outstanding. Great plot keeps your attention. While John Goodman's part is small compared to most of is roles, he does a superb job.  I could watch this again!
B0076DELIG|3.0|This was a very good read, love the way he keeps his stories together. He keeps your interest to the point of becoming a &#34;page turner&#34;, when things heat up.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Another story that has come from the Twific stable. If not a direct transfer from fanfic (I can't find a link) it is certainly heavily influenced by that genre.<br /><br />Intelligent sexy bad boy Travis is saved from a downward spiral into crime and a life of sexual depravity through the love of a good girl Abi with a shady and disturbed past, who is torn between choosing to love the boy she ought to fall in love with, Parker (good reputation, good job prospects, good family, but boring) or the bad boy Travis who she is inescapably drawn to despite her efforts not to fall for him.<br /><br />The anguish they both experience as Abi battles not to love Travis is what makes this story great, and in the end of course, she makes the right decision.<br /><br />The secondary characters are well written, although the whole story has more of a high school feel than university.<br /><br />The audio book is easy to listen too and well narrated, the female voice is strong and husky.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Can't get enough of this one. Lots of levels, it challenges me and keeps me coming back to play more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and it is my most favorite game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! Because u get to jump on trains,earn coins,and even earn lots of interesting and different characters!!!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very fun game. It's a lot different from the original Temple Run because of how much is added to it. I highly recommend it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought this was a great book. It sucked me in and I couldn't put it down. I didn't see any of the twists and turns coming ahead of time. I've already started reading another book by the same author. On my definitely recommend list.
B00ANW33CM|4.0|I'm not the best at hand to eye coordination, so making the cubes spin to find the matches is a tad challenging.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|In short the record is like water from a mountian stream, It is at once old and new again. wonderful songs ,harmony,great writing craft and the heart that gos with it, If you loved the Eagles, Poco, the harmonys of Dan fogelberg, miss real records where everyone is at the top of there game, your wait is over. Buy this record and a second for a friend. The songs will keep playing in you head, Like long lost and new found friends

B0054SMID0|5.0|Good movie. Worth the time, if you are a fan of MM, you are going to enjoy it for sure
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book.  Kept my attention the whole way.  Very informative about the whole Navy Seal experience.  I would highly recommend this book.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|great movie, singing and acting. I wish I could just select the number of stars I want to rate movie without typing in this review.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Very inspiring book... ;)<br />Not worse nor better than the first one.<br />I would definitely recommend this purchase.  Thank you amazon to made the trilogy available on ebook!
B008L1F91A|5.0|After being happy with my Green Lantern, I had to pick this up too. Pretty much my same thoughts. I own a few DC Universe 6 inch figures of Superman. This statue is kind of similar. However, this statue is taller, little larger, and more detailed than any of them (I've added a pic to compare). What stands out the most, especially from the DC Universe 6 inch figures, is the great metallic finish look. Great details on the actual packaging. Nice price for what you're getting. Will be collecting all of them New 52 statues.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|this is a great novel and I am anxiously anticipating the next installment. From what I can see, however, it doesn't seem that Amazon will be carrying the next e-installment (Tower Lord). What a disappointment!
B001CDZZI6|1.0|I purchased this item digitally on February 7, at 6:30 pm. It is now February 10, at 7:15am. I still have not been sent the access code so that I can<br />go to the website to take the assessment. The description when buying this item said that it could take UP TO 24 to 48 hours to receive the code.<br />Well, the UP TO part has passed, and I am nearing a deadline for an assignment due that involved the assessment.<br />Can somebody get the access code sent to me immediately so I don't fail my assignment due to false advertisement.<br />I gave you my money on the spot when I bought the item, so where is my access code????????
B007EECSFA|4.0|This was a mystery that kept me in suspense.  It flowed without giving away the real secret.  It was hard to put the book down.
0394818237|5.0|Filled with great illustrations and interesting stories for the little ones.  My now grown sons (and I) loved Richard Scarry's books.  You really cannot go wrong with these fun and educational books.  A great gift idea.
B000002KJM|5.0|Excellent! Probably my favorite ZZ album. And this was back before Billy Gibbons had \\"the beard\\". How did he perform so well without it.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I loved the character development, although they were highly unlikable characters. I kept reading-couldn't wait to find out what happened next. It was definitely a dark novel-like the title suggests,  And I kept trying to solve the murders to no avail.  I recommend the novel, just don't be surprised if you don't figure it out before the end.
B001NLKT60|5.0|All Stieg Larsson's books have been hard to put down.  At first getting accoustomed to all the Swedish names and places was difficult, but after reading the trilogy I almost feel Swedish.  I wish there could be more.  What a wonderful mystery.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A continuation of the absorbing tale of several families from widely different backgrounds, this time set against the backdrop of World War II.  Mr. Follett once again weaves an intriguing story, connecting many lives and situations keeping the reader totally involved.  There are many details relating to the era of my parents' youth that were new to me and enlightening.  It was most interesting as a true product of the American Melting Pot to be presented with so many sides to the story.  I eagerly await Book Three of the series.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham never disappoints, and The Racketeer had enough twists to keep you guessing until the very end.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing. It is to die for!!! Do you like horses? Well I do and if you are horse crazy this is the app for you! Happy riding!!!  :)
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|If you like fart jokes, you will like Ted. If you are sophomoric, you will enjoy Ted. If you have absolutely no taste in movies, you will like Ted
B0052RDHTM|5.0|An absorbing tale of several families from widely different backgrounds set against the backdrop of World War I.  Mr. Follett weaves an intriguing story, connecting many lives and situations keeping the reader totally involved.  There are many details relating to that era that were missing from my education.  It was most interesting as a true product of the American Melting Pot to be presented with so many sides to the story and a chance to peer into my ancesters' time.  I couldn't wait to open the second book in the series.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Great family movie with a classic story line.  It has it all, great animation, fairies, fantasy and a heartwarming love story. Would recommend for family viewing
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun fun fun! keeps your interest.  Good graphics. works well on Kindle Fire. Horse lover's will enjoy this app. Nice that you do not have to buy coins. You can earn them fairly fast. this will make parents happy.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I have read a lot of Jack Reacher books and enjoy them all.<br />The twist at the end was very interesting and suited todays world problems
B009X01C64|5.0|This case is great. I really like it and its great for reading while lying down or sitting at a table.
B0094WK9EC|5.0|I have truly enjoyed this work of art. I just wish I lived in Europe to enjoy there music that much more.
B004WR125O|5.0|use it on my receiver and it works perfectly.  thought the price was a bit high after find non name brand  adapters much cheaper.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Again a gripping story from first page to last.  Can't wait to get to another in the series.He keeps you guessing!
B00942G4UA|5.0|If you want to make change to eat more healthy this will guide you in the right direction.  It is appalling to see what has happened to our food supply chain.  By local and quit supporting the greedy corporations that have monopolized our food system.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This was a well written book, about subjects that are often not covered because they are hard to deal with, loss, grief, marriage break down.  It also brought in a range of other topics and each page gave you something different to think about.  I really enjoyed the read and would highly recommend it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Outstanding! Loved it! Had not watched prior to watching the current third season, and especially enjoyed ability to watch the entire second season with no weekly gaps.
B009MF5BXK|2.0|I was enjoying the movie and ready to consider it a four-star flick, until the airport scenes. The last 20 minutes are such a big letdown! The villain, aptly if a little cornily named Vilain, has absolutely no escape plans, and that just doesn't make any sense even in a it-doesn't-need-to-make-any-sense film like this. Also it's another letdown that Jet Li doesn't appear in the bulk of the film, leaving out some of the humor and chemistry. Before the airport scenes I thought I'd watch the film again, but afterwards I immediately returned the rental to Redbox.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game for my kids. lots of interaction. a fun game for a winter day. I really enjoy this game. clean fun.
0385336950|5.0|I thought I was ordering the book that inspired the movie Cloud Atlas. This wasn't it, but an extremely pleasant read none the less.
0451232852|4.0|My knowledge of events leading up to and encompassing WWI has been sketchy at best. Ken Follott`s Fall of Giants has intersted me to read more about this era. Reading in the quiet hours of the night separates the sleep inducing works from those that generate page turning. This book was a page turner. What a wonderful weave of family drama and historical events! Thank you Mr Follett.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Was great to play. Reported some glitches and was told I would be compensated if I got a live account. All I got was nothing. Game will not stay connected to live and they never sent anything. Can't believe I wasted $ on this game
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is a fun series that has you wanting more. Try to watch just one episode!  I've been told the first two seasons are the best.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I like the game. Its fun. My son loves playing it, he plays for hours at a time, thanks for the free game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a great read. I love to read John Grisham and this one most certainly did not disappoint.  What a suprise.
B0054SMID0|3.0|It's Matthew McConaughey, so you can't go wrong! It was a little predictable, but I still enjoyed the movie and would even watch it again.
B002NUULNG|4.0|This is a great film to watch. The blu ray version has some problems, like being to bright sometimes, but it didnt really bother me. Luckily, the disc has the original version on it.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|It is a good game but you  need to give us more ways to get peanuts without spending money because it is hard to control it with kids that supposed to try to keep it running
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Patricia Cornwell is a great writer.  She puts in so many twists and turns sometimes it is hard to follow.  Her character's personal battles are always interesting, but sometimes I get tired of all the drama within her relationships with Benton, Lucy and Marino

B002ZG97EC|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband, who also loves it. Yes, we are adults, but it really is a wonderful film. Good story line, funny parts, and in Blu-ray the movie is fantastic. I would definitely recommend the movie to children and adults.
B00932A6G4|3.0|Kinda cheesy.  The move to animation lost something.  However, I'm not a big fan of animation that's supposed to imitate live actors.
B003B02O14|4.0|I liked it alot all the way to the end. I did not like that he was left hanging and she left him. It seemed totally out of character for her. I could have seen her being angry because her father was dragged into the mess, but given the level of devotion we witnessed in her up to the end I found her abandoning him not plausable.

B003V5ED7W|5.0|A great movie with values and great comedy. We watch as a family movie at least 2-3 times per year. Sit back and enjoy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks and think he did a great job with this book again. Can't wait to see the movie now!
B009NNG202|1.0|This was a thoroughly unpleasant movie. Odor is it's driving theme & I found this film to be odorous. I can not possibly recommend this unwatchable film to anyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book, and a must read. First book to make me cry! So good, can not wait to go see the movie. Won't be as good as the book though

B0035S996U|3.0|&#34;The Warriors&#34; is a good film. I went to the cinema with my friends many moons ago to see it. It has a good story, good actors [a few of whom have gone onto accomplished careers], vivid cinematography & the fast paced action style that director Walter Hill is now so well known for. A good show.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|One of the best books I have read. I would recommend this for any fantasy fan who likes drama and action.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|GREAT MOVIE FOR KIDS AND ADULTS. I ORDERED AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND IT ARRIVED IN PLENTY OF TIME BEFORE CHRISTMAS.<br />I REALLY ENJOYED WATCHING THIS MOVIE WITH THE FAMILY.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This program really puts you in the lives of the characters. It is rich in production, settings are very real and the acting is amazing.
B004SUDPWI|5.0|&#34;The Bridge On The river Kwai&#34; is simply a brilliant film. One of the best ever made.All elements of this outstanding film are perfection. No flaws whatsoever. A true classic.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Billy Beane changed the way that scouts look at prospects.  The best baseball players were good at playing baseball, not running the fastest 60 time, or hitting home runs in batting practice, or throwing 95 mph fastballs in the bullpen.  Can you get on base, can you score runs, can you get people out, that is what baseball players should be ranked on.  Well Done Billy.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|This is exactly what I needed to record one track at a time into ableton live. Before this, I would put analog signal directly into my laptop and the conversion woud always result in a nasty amount of ambient noise. This device does away with that problem, offering a very clean noiseless conversion. There are a lot of other uses I'm not utilizing, but for recording and making your own song step by step you either need a really good sound card or this.
B00AFWEPVI|4.0|After reading the comments I was hesitant to purchase but I'm glad I did... This app gives the standard camera on my Kindle HD extra features including zoom. The only thing is that to exit the app I have to use the home button not my back arrow button, but that's a minor detail compared to all the great features I now have
1449410243|5.0|Great book even if you don't like cats! Hilarious! Can't wait for another book of the Oatmeal team! Highly recommended!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A fun game. The graphics are well done. If you like horses and animal games you will probably enjoy this. I'm on level 15 and have not had to pay a dime for any game currency.<br />HOWEVER, most of the \\"cool\\" items and horses cost gems which is the games pay-for currency. You can earn gems by completing certain quests and you get one ever time you level upon, but not nearly enough to purchase any of the \\"cool\\" items or horses. So either deal with low end items or pay real money for gems.<br />Also, the ads start to get WAY out of hand after a while. For the first few levels they are scarce but after level five or so they get obnoxious. Almost every time I try to do one of the mini-games I will get an ad pop-up. They will even pop up in the middle of competitions! It gets pretty obnoxious.
B00AFWEPVI|2.0|Takes lousy photos.  Too dark and blurry.  I'm very disappointed in this product. I definitely got what I paid for.
1878424319|5.0|Loved it, loved it.  I have recommended it to many of my friends and we have discussions based upon the principle of living a far more insightful, kind, loving (of ourselves and others) life.  There is a sequel called the Fifth Agreement which I do not think is as good as just the Four Agreements.
B001P06GX4|3.0|It is a fun game but too many pieces NOt much fun with 2 players.Not what I was looking for
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I like it because I though it would be useful and fun and helpful love the dictionary I thought it would be easy to use ok goodbye
B009AP2G26|2.0|Not my kind of show - the singing was good, but I'm really not interested in this type of comedy/entertainment
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I really liked this book. For me it was as interesting as Pillars of the Earth or the World Without End.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|This was a good movie.  Story and plot kept me going for awhile.  I would probably watch it again.  I like Tommy Lee Jones.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is just an awesome game but I just have one question. Have any of you got a prize from the puzzle place?
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Excellent! So much more than a book about hiking - a real journey through this woman's life, past and present. It'll pose questions for your own life too.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This book didn't end how I thought it would and I really appreciated that!<br />I tend to select light, romance focused stories. And this book fits that, but it adds depth with a deeper than usual romance nivel development of two characters. I felt more interested because of this.<br />And then the ending is great. So true. So real.<br />I recommend this for a light, but not inane, read.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|After a slow moving beginning, &#34;Safe Haven&#34; grips the reader with strong suspence and interest, especially with the device of getting into the villain's mind by having him narrate part of the story as we read his thoughts and motivations.
1593974744|5.0|Several centuries in the future, planet Earth is at risk from a third invasion of fearsome aliens whom the people of Earth have nicknamed \\"Buggers.\\" Because of the enormous threat posed by these aliens, an uneasy peace has been maintained for several generations, in the years since the first invasion, between the three political factions who control the planet, the Hegemon, Polemarch, and Strategos. Each group has continuously contributed soldiers to the International Fleet (IF) which was formed to protect the planet from the Buggers. In order to prepare for the Buggers' presumed inevitable third invasion, the IF created the Battle School, a military program located on a space station whose goal is to locate and mold children with high intelligence into leaders capable of planning and launching military attacks in space against the Buggers. The children are subjected to rigorous, often brutal training conditions in order to prepare them to defeat the Buggers once and for all in a final Armageddon of a war. At the start of this book, the IF has only a few years left to come up with a general who is capable of saving the Earth from Bugger destruction, a force that outnumbers Earth's fleet by an enormous margin.<br /><br />Ender Wiggin is only six years old when he is selected for training at the Battle School. In the world of this story, Earth is overpopulated, and couples are penalized for having more than two children. The Wiggin family is different, however. Ender's parents had him at the request of the IF command. Their eldest son Peter, who is 10 at the start of the story, is utterly brilliant, and the IF had previously hoped he might be the candidate for military leadership they were seeking, until they discovered Peter to be a budding sociopath who tortures and kills animals and terrorizes Ender and his sister. They had also considered the second Wiggin offspring, 8-year-old Valentine, as a possible future general, because she, too, is immensely intelligent, but ultimately they removed her from consideration as well; her disposition is too soft and yielding for her to ever be a general. Fortunately for the world, Ender seems to be just the right combination of brains, backbone, and emotional empathy to potentially lead Earth's efforts to defeat the all-powerful Buggers.<br /><br />I'm not personally a reader of science fiction. Prior to this book I had read, tops, perhaps three science fiction books in my life, therefore I can only judge this book as a fan of popular fiction in general.<br /><br />This book is phenomenal in every way imaginable. The character development is absolutely amazing--Ender is one of the most fascinating characters I've encountered in years, and the major subcharacters are all distinct and compelling, without ever upstaging Ender. The world-building, especially the battles in zero-gravity, is so marvelously done, that even someone who doesn't enjoy the high-tech details of typical space operas can understand everything that is happening in every scene.<br /><br />I experienced this book in the audio format. I love audiobooks, and this is one of the best of the best I have ever encountered. The main narrator, Stefan Rudnicki, has a lusciously mellow voice that is a joy to listen to, and he imparts terrific emotion and acting skill to his narration. I am definitely going to be seeking out other books he has narrated. A cast of additional voice talents contributed to this production but, unfortunately, I cannot find a listing of their names in credits for the audiobook anywhere, other than the name of the famous author Harlan Ellison, who was one of the readers. A female narrator read the sections from Valentine's point of view, and she did a great job, too. The author also read one small part of the narrative, but lamentably, I also could not ferret out which part he read either.<br /><br />All in all, this audiobook is a truly worthy production of a classic book, which is an awe-inspiring exampleof sophisticated writing. In the author's discussion of this story at the end of the reading of the book, he explains that in writing this work, he envisioned it as best experienced being read out loud. It is definitely a book that merits audio production. Not every novel can withstand being read out loud, which is a much more leisurely way of ingesting a book than reading it silently to oneself. At such a slow pace, every flaw is spotlighted, but since this masterpiece has no discernible flaws, listening to it narrated becomes an experience of savoring a gourmet feast for the mind.of sophisticated writing.

B0054NRC6S|3.0|It looked kind of neat in the preview I imagine I'll see the movie eventually. So 3 stars seems fitting.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Just beginning to know what to say.  Won't describe experiences that inform my perspective on the subject matter.  Suffice to say this is just about the best writing, directing, and *acting* I've seen in decades.  MI-5 was great, this is better.  No, the &#34;war on terror&#34; isn't carried on this swiftly or successfully -- as we should all know by now.  Connecting the dots very rarely is done this easily.  But put those caveats down to creative license.  It is almost impossible to imagine characters expressed so richly, so wonderfully, so chaotic and deterministic at the same time.  Could any other ensemble improve on this one?  This is, simply put, a success.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this, see it.  Soon and often.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game I mean I love it when trains and barriers try so hard to kill you it makes sense
1607066017|2.0|There are a lot of us out there that find Saga to be sub-par -<br />not merely a comic that is not to our 'tastes', but lacking in 5 star merit.<br />We don't quite understand the almost universal and overwhelming applause for this title.<br />There are many of the opinion that the art feels rushed and is not particularly well done.<br />That the story seems a bit thin and shallow and boring and unfocused.<br />There are many who find that the mixing of sci-fi and fantasy here doesn't really work.<br />We're not saying the comic is horrible, just that we don't think it's near as good as the hype.
B0012VP8MQ|3.0|I saw this movie years ago, it's fun to see Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte in their earlier years. The movie just gets an average rating because I never really liked this film altogether. I would say it gets 3 stars because of the nostalgia it gave me. It really wasn't that bad, or that great. Cops and robbers shoot em up, that's pretty much the whole movie.
B000IZA9PI|2.0|I really hate when characters are forced by the plot to do stupid things.  The whole concept that on a massive star ship the Captain or First Officer always goes on away missions gets old after a while.

B008GFI418|5.0|Each minute is a visual and audio treat reviewing the brilliant career one, Sir George Henry Martin.  It was quite a revelation that he is &#34;Cockney&#34; from North London and that he made a conscious effort to up-class his manner of speaking to &#34;posh&#34; BBC-level.  All these years I had assumed that he was a high-born toff while in fact his mother cried when she didn't have enough money to buy him an ice cream from a passing van (truck).  The linguistic makeover was a smart move, which might account for the fact that the big-wigs at EMI (some with titles of nobility) promoted him to head Parlophone despite his relatively young age.  (Plus he was taller than average, a Royal Navy veteran (aviator), radiated a quiet authority, and clearly loved his work.)  The bosses never properly compensated Martin while working for EMI even though he was making the parent company and its stock holders tons of moolah not to mention winning fat bonuses for the sales and marketing staff.  Lennon could be somewhat of an insensitive punk; this is well known.  This is seen when he cruelly told Martin that the Beatles wanted to record an album without any of his usual production &#34;crap.&#34;  Then Lennon and Harrison (behind Martin's back, mind you) took the tapes of to Phil &#34;Wall of Schlock&#34; Spectator (sic) to &#34;over-produce&#34; (Martin lets slip a bit of his understated caustic humor when discussing the Spector episode) what became &#34;Let It Be.&#34;  We discover also that Martin has a strong competitive streak, but do not all creative persons that struggle to get their work out there?  But some of his &#34;attitude&#34; might come from his Cockney origins whose social class constraints might have strangled his talent had not he attracted the attention and received help from certain a certain &#34;fairy godfather&#34; that, unobserved, heard Martin playing piano freely and then suggested he look into studying music formally, which of course he did (and at a relatively advanced age, too).  Does anyone need reminding about how Martin used his compositional and arranging skills learned during three hears at Guildhall School of Music and Drama?  The world is so much better off that he &#34;failed&#34; to realize his dream of being the next Rachmaninoff.  I should leave off here for fear of spoiling the pleasure of watching this documentary for yourself.  There is one priceless scene, however, where the usually unflappable Martin registers surprise:  He is having tea with Margaret Eliot (mother of Peter Asher and the beautiful Jane Asher], who had been his oboe tutor in the early days.  He jokingly asks her whether she still played, and Mrs. Eliot stated that yes, indeed, she did.  He appears gobsmacked.  For the oboe is a physically demanding instrument, requiring a strict embouchure and air stream; not to mention a sense of pitch on par with that of a violinist.  I would stop here, except to mention that Paul McCartney has a loving and respectful chat with Mr. Martin.  (Would love to see a Vol. 2 of &#34;extras&#34; featuring McCartney and other interviewees.)  Finally, this documentary has the benefit of featuring both his son Giles Martin and his wife Judy, who he met at the famed Abbey Road.  Giles, as you probably know, was full partner in the brilliant &#34;Love&#34; production with his father.  He exhibits exceptional talent as an interviewer; perhaps the BBC (or other entity) will employ him in a similar capacity for future documentary productions.  Lady Judy Martin is a wonderful human being and the sort of woman that are far too few in number these days.  Shots of the loving couple riding together in a vintage British motor car (top down of course) through the countryside give this exceptionally fine documentary a poignancy that makes one glad to have experienced the creative genius of Sir George H. Martin then (c. 1963), now (2013), and far into the future.latively advanced age, too).

B005HSL626|4.0|We love this game, the whole famly can play and we see who can get high score.  Low scores gets to do chores.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|The first four chapters are really riveting. The rest of the book is good but it is the first four that really set the stage. The author knows how to paint a picture with words and put you there.
B007URVZJ6|1.0|I wanted to do what should be a simple operation: connecting an item in the table of contents to the text by a hyperlink.  Specifically, in a poetry book I tried to connect each poem with the entry I had made for it in the table of contents.  I followed the instructions on a Mac, and then on a Dell computer.  NOTHING worked the way it was supposed to according to the instructions.  Every sequence of instruction brought out erratic results that were nowhere near what I wanted to do.  When the book said, click this, and this will happen, nothing of the kind happened.  The book is free, but that is small comfort, considering the hours of wasted time which I can ill afford.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|For me, no app could ever be any handier or more useful and informative than having the ability to access my home computer.Best app ever!
B005PK553C|2.0|I think this targets a female audience, based on the characters, plot and setting.  Too much drama, very light on the scares, and it is very clearly much more sympathetic to the women and girls.  I only watched the first episode but for some reason Amazon wants me to review the whole season.  I did make it through the first, and I won't bother with the rest.<br /><br />The horror itself starts off like an American horror movie but quickly degrades into something not quite Japanese...like American horror they want to shove the scary thing in your face, but like Japanese horror, well, it doesn't really make any sense.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|Keeps you hanging and makes you want to watch more. I highly recommend. I have enjoyed seasons of Fringe so far and haven't been disappointed at all.
B008IBPMZG|4.0|They picked a great period for a period piece, because there's great social upheaval in a time that we probably have not spent enough time with in high school history, that mirrors some of the upheavals of our own time.  There's also a lot going on with many characters, who are so excellently portrayed that we never lose track of who they are.  It's also great to see that some of the characters in the story are as confused about the lineage of British peerages as everyone else.

B00AMBLXP8|3.0|As a huge Seth MacFarlane fan, I was disappointed.  The movie was funny and I enjoyed it, but I had expected it to be much funnier.
B0030MKGKY|3.0|I've read some of the other Vets' reviews and concur, so I won't repeat them. I'll just say that it is amazing to me that this movie was sooooo hyped... it tells me that at the time, the public was hungry for footage around the Iraq war, making this very much a period piece. What amazes me is how formulaic the film is: a John-Wayne central character who doesn't play by the rules and cannot seem to suppress that thrill of combat even when his family is in consideration. Yuck!!! Obviously, those of us who are actually military Vets are shaking our heads at the misrepresentation... Hollywood, you might want to learn that good writing about REAL situations is better than being lazy and following some formula. Even mediocre representatinon of the truth -- in my humble opinion -- is better than these types of wash-rinse-repeat plots: One of my favorites is &#34;We Were Soldiers&#34;, a sleeper hit that was an excellent book and a fairly well produced movie which represented ALL sides of men at war, and the movie did not fall to these types of ridiculous lonely-soldier-John-Wayne-crossed-with-adrenaline-need that seems to be a recurring need for audiences who weren't there. If you are okay with that type of entertainment, consider this a five star movie. And while I have no problem if that is what you want (I like those types of movies, just not where I have experience), for my review, I have to give this three stars.

B009VB7P6G|5.0|I liked this movie because it was clean (no bad language), had beautiful details in the scenes, good plot line, and had funny moments.

0307477479|5.0|Back in 1964, the Rolling Stones sang, \\"Time is on my side.\\" A character in Jennifer Egan's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel says, \\"Time is a goon.\\" (Webster's definition--a man hired to terrorize; an enforcer.)<br /><br />This is a book about time and about what it does to people and to the culture and to rock and roll! It's a series of glimpses into the interconnected lives of many characters over a period of about 40 years. Every chapter could be a stand-alone short story, but, taken together, they tell the story of...well--time, and people, and culture, and rock and roll.<br /><br />Almost every character mentioned reappears in another character's story, so that the stories all weave together. But the reader has to pay close attention to names and time clues, because the chapters are not in chronological order. Thus, chapter 1 is about Sasha at age 35, chapter 2 mentions Sasha at a little younger age, chapter 10 is about Sasha at age 21, chapter 11 is about Sasha at age 19 or 20, and chapter 12 has Sasha in her late 40s. I imagine some people will grow irritated at all this jumping around, but then \\"Time is a goon,\\" isn't it.<br /><br />The last two chapters are set in the future, and the next-to-last one is a power point diary! The last chapter pictures a time when people are uncomfortable talking to each other and prefer to text-message even when face-to-face, when four-year-olds determine the music that is produced, and when paid \\"parrots\\" can generate enthusiasm about almost anything,over the internet. The character Alex is paid to choose among his 15,896 friends to find 50 who have need, reach, and corruptibility and will go along with his scheme for promoting a concert--people who have \\"stopped being themselves without realizing it.\\"<br /><br />All of this review makes the book sound like it is incoherent, but it isn't. It is so well done that the parts make sense, the time-shifts make sense, the different narrative viewpoints make sense. It is very funny in some parts. Even an attempted rape, the \\"Suicide Tour\\" of an aging rocker, and the public relations campaign for a genocidal dictator come off as humorous (and that's not easy to do). It is very depressing in some parts: one character wants to ask Lou, the aging rock producer, \\"How did you get so old? Was it all at once, in a day, or did you peter out bit by bit?.... Did you know this was coming and hide that you knew, or did it ambush you from behind.\\"<br /><br />But time can also be redemptive, and people and the culture and the environment and rock and roll can improve and bounce back from really low places. And that makes this novel very hopeful.<br /><br />This novel is highly recommended. It is inventive, has well-developed and believable characters, has something important to say. and most of all, it's fun to read.<br /><br />I wonder if Mick Jagger still thinks that time is on his side.

B009POCFTG|4.0|Well, if you like your humor dark, real dark and you like your violence sudden and unexpected and you like your nudity all up front, have I got a movie for you.  In a film featuring a family of a dictionary-perfect picture of \\"trailer trash,\\" we get an early look at what is to come.<br /><br />Chris (Emile Hirsch), the 20 something son comes banging on the trailer home of his erstwhile family, locked out in a driving rainstorm in north Texas.  Answering the door is his stepmother, Sharla (Gina Gershon) with her bushy bush staring young Chris in the eyes.  It appears the boy owes the local loan sharks $6K and could lose his life if he doesn't quickly come up with the money.  Ansel (Thomas Haden Church), Chris' father doesn't have any money and doesn't seem to care much either.  Certainly Sharla is no help as she hates Chris and just about everybody else.  Chris' virginal sister Dottie (Juno Temple) completes the brood.<br /><br />They discover that Chris and Dottie's mother and Ansel's ex-wife has taken out a $50K life insurance policy and believe young Dottie is the beneficiary.  Everyone hates the alcoholic/drug addicted ex.  Even Dottie, as her mother tried to smother her as a youngster.  Remember, I said it was dark.<br /><br />Enter the picture Dallas detective Joe Cooper (brilliant Matthew McConaughey).  It seems Joe also has a sideline.  Murder for hire.  Only problem is that Joe can't get paid until the life insurance policy is cashed.  So Joe makes a deal after seeing sweet, innocent young Dottie in the flesh.  He will use her as collateral, or a retainer as Joe explains it.<br /><br />All the characters are perverted, but only smooth talking Joe has anything between the ears.  The film has a couple twists and turns that will keep you guessing between scenes of the dysfunctional family.  Directed by the long absent William Friedkin (\\"The Exorcist\\"), the film is not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach.  It is likely you will never eat another KFC fried chicken leg again.chicken leg again.

B00AG472HY|2.0|There are many excellent review for this movie so I'll just add a few words of my own. If you are an Eddie Murphy fan, I think you will be satisfied with this film. His antics and timing are right on and he manages to rescue this film from obscurity. I took off one star for the New Age gobbledygook that has little to do with the real world and detracts from the story. Another star removed for the basic concepts of this film being repeats of Jim Carrey's \\"Liar Liar,\\" \\"Yes Man,\\" etc., and one more star for the notion that a father raising a child with his male partner could ever be considered cute. How could denying a child the love of a mother be in any way humorous?<br /><br />Enjoy the flim, then rent \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\"...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved it. To have a Physician go through this experience and then write about it knowing he will be ostracized was amazing.<br /><br />Couldn't put it down. Great read.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|It took a few episodes for me to decide if I really liked it and by the end I was hooked.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I highly recommend this book!  It is great story of a girl how grows up in foster homes until she ages out of the system.  She must learn to fin for herself or be homeless.  She finds friends, a job and makes a family but has to learn how to be in those relationships since she never felt loved in her childhood.
B008Y6WPXC|1.0|Only watched the first 10 minutes and that was enough gore for me. Thought it might be a little more entertaining; but it is just another guts and blood movie.
0988936402|4.0|Full disclosure: This star rating is revised (from a 3 to a 4) to reflect changes made based on my editing input, hence my listing as a contributing editor. However, when this review was originally published, I had no connection to the book at all, and I therefore leave it in its entirety, to remain a trustworthy source of information regarding the quality of \\"Everville: The First Pillar\\". Its complains regarding editing are out of date however, and will be addressed after the original review.<br />-------<br />Full Disclosure: Purchased book while on sale for free on initial release.<br />In the first book in the Everville series, Mr. Huff introduces us to his world by pitching us in headfirst. Often, in first parts to a series, the book itself will suffer for its position by being bogged down with too much information, set up so that the series to come can be better understood. However, in Everville, flashbacks construct a journey that parallels the main character's while providing insight into the history and current status of Everville, and how it is made up. The result is a fast-paced full-on blast of information that quickly does away with the slow plot issues that bog down \\"part ones\\". Because the work is comparatively short, it can easily be consumed in less than a day.<br />In fact, the plot of \\"The First Pillar\\" moves at an incredible speed - at times too fast, as Mr. Huff skates over some details that would have been valuable to have. Many characters have minimal description, as do many actions, and the generally short sentences contribute to the sense of rushing pace. Most of the book is dialogue, and the action can be so rushed at times it is hard to tell who is speaking. The occasional errant or lacking quotation marks don't help.<br />Indeed, the entire work would have benefitted from a fresh set of editorial eyes - the occasional homophone slips in, and the spelling of one character's name occasionally shifts slightly (who I had a hard time recognizing, because he was not actually introduced by name, it just sort of appeared). The major editorial complaint, however, is that moments of third person perspective find their way into first person descriptions, which is really rather jarring.<br />Characterization is sufficient - I would have liked to see more, and heard less. \\"Show, don't tell\\" as the old adage goes, and some characters suffer from a bit too much telling and not enough showing. On the other hand, I found myself curiously attached to them regardless, especially the enigmatic Zee and Drusilla.<br />Mr. Huff's true talent lies in his creativity, however. He has created not so much a magic system as a new way of viewing the operations of the universe, and while details were light, I expect that as the characters venture deeper into it, more of Mr. Huff's inventiveness will shine through.<br />Further, I sincerely enjoyed his descriptions of combat. I'll not go into detail here, for the sake of preventing spoilers, but the battles interested and engaged me, as did his use of bo staves, which I'm personally a fan of, though they are often neglected in fantasy literature in favor of magic swords and the like.<br />The bottom line? Mr. Huff's debut novel \\"Everville: The First Pillar\\" is an exciting foray into an interesting new world, but a few contrivances and a rushed editing job detract from the experience. Appropriate for young adults, fantasy fans. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could, but rough editing makes me settle for 3 rather than 4. As always, if anything needs clarification or you have any questions, please don't hesitate to comment below, or contact me at SeanOnAmazon@gmail.com!<br />-------<br />After the publishing of this review, I was contacted by the author for assistance with a revised edition, to remove mechanical errors and clean up the editing. I have done so to the best of my ability, and while I will not claim that it is now free of editorial error, I believe it worthy of adjustment tofour stars.four stars.
B004K58GSO|5.0|With John Wayne and Robert Mitchum, you have a definite headliner cast for a great iconic cowboy movie. It's got everything we love about cowboy movies: heroes who are truthful and honest and believe in all the right things; bad guys who don't; showdowns; fistfights, and a lot more. Look for Johnny Crawford (Lucas McCain's son Mark in the Rifleman) to play a small, very brief but pivotal role in the plot.
B004AQR24W|3.0|I'll make this one quick. Granted, you don't watch a flick like this for great dialogue or inspired acting. Those of us who believe in the whole good vs. evil/ elite small group triumphs against overwhelming odds paradigm, enjoy these shoot 'em ups, and cool martial arts choreography is a plus. This movie has a good bit of all that, and I would have given it four stars except that Stallone has made ten fortunes on exactly that paradigm, but now he's come out as an anti-Second Amendment typical Hollyweird lefty. I'll never pay to see anything he's connected with again.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like to feed the horses.  This is a good app for horse lovers.  It is fun for kids and grown ups.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|DA is a classic that takes you back in time while giving history, beautiful customs and a great storyline. We love the characters and their individual stories.
B0095P3ULC|2.0|Although the modern Transformer series  has incredible special effects, a movie needs more than that. The Transformers we new when we were younger were different, openly honest and strictly adhering to moral standards; but with the newer version,even the Good ones seem to be a bit more sinister and we're not always certain that they are on our side. The transformation sequence is extremely confusing and hard to follow, unlike the simpler older style. I do not like many movies these days because Hollywood seems bent on reinventing the legend of whatever character or franchise they take on, for their own purposes. There is some of that here. With some unnecessary bathroom humor as well. Strictly for special effects fans only.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|How does the author create a story that entwines all the characters to this amazing level....  An amazing heart wrenching story.  You can almost feel the turmoil coming as you continue to read unsure what it is going to be.  I read this within 24 hours.  I could not put it down.  Great job.  Great story.  I would recommend it and plan on re-reading it in the future.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This is my first Richard Castle book, I bought it because I love the show.  The book is also very entertaining book, very engaging.  I have trouble putting it down.  Not deep just entertaining.
B007MHVVCU|5.0|This book is GREAT!!!<br />It's about Matthew Freeman (main person of this book) trying to steal things when he is caught and put into the LEAF project(read the book to find out what that is). He needs to stay with Ms. Deverill. But when Matthew finds out what she's doing he can't possibly escape her. But Matthew must stop it or the world's going to end.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|This is one of my favorite superhero, action movies.  I never really knew the Captain America story, but it is really good.  Can't wait for the sequel.
B003DCTC6K|5.0|It is a sad story but I have to give it five stars because the story and acting is spellbinging and the characters are so well developed.  The result of all the liaisons is very sad and leaves me with wishing for a happier ending but based on what the characters are attempting to do it would not be possible.  Glenn Close does a great job in her creating of dangerous persuits.I loved the film but it made me very sad.
1559277734|4.0|I really enjoyed this audiobook and will probably look for more by this author. the story kept my interest besides being entertaining.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The ending of the twilight saga is extremely satisfying, no matter what you hear about the end.  Though I am sad it is over, it is a brilliant book.
B006BQM762|4.0|This movie is very good.  It runs along the storyline of ET, but has some other twists to it. My only objection is the foul language that is used by even the young actors in this movie.  If they had done that differently, I would have given it 5 stars.
B004A8ZWWO|1.0|i finally got a chance to watch this movie...it came quickly was impressed with seller BUT as i'm watching the movie....i found that the sound at certain points of movie are so low that i can't hear what's going on....i will NOT be buying from this seller again
0399160450|5.0|A great read, just wish it weren't so long but it's still worth the time.  You can pretty much see where it's headed early on.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|My wife introduced me to this show and now I'm hooked.  Each episode keeps you wanting more.  There is always a cliff hanger at the end of each and you can never simply watch one!
B00821OX98|4.0|Great show, can't wait for season 2, streaming quality could be better, looks very good but not as smooth flowing during fast motion.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I thought this was a great read.  Very different; technology plus intrigue. Recommended as a fun read.  Some interesting history as well as humor!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is one of my favorite games to play. Makes you think and sharpens your vision and focus more than other games.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Easy to stream and watch, stop/resume from where I left off, etc. The show, of course, is awesome! No commercials.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Dear Life by Alice Munro:  This is Munro at the top of her game.  I enjoy Munro's short stories and this is really up to pare!
B008Q08580|3.0|Good movie. Although  I was surprised in the end to find out that justice wasn't served. But I can understand why. If the movie was based on a true story.... then, that's how it plays out sometimes in the real world.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the Oldie Worldy stories of the life of a little Boy lost growing up in the wold of Jungle Animals.
B00499NHLC|5.0|My niece-in-law suggested this show and us being ok with foreign movies & shows decided to try it out. If you like Psych (which can be funny and immature at times) then you will like the mature manner in which they solve mysteries...it is cool to float between the two. I just wish there were more episodes!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game will keep kids busy for trying to win and get all the coins.subway surfer  is also good for any age ranging from 2-40.
B00006J9OV|1.0|I never got past the prelude. The distortion was severe with obvious saturation when the brass were playing their loudest.  I can forgive poor sound when I am listening to historic recordings, but this level of technical incompetence in a contemporary commercial recording is simply unacceptable.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Unable to stop reading. Very captivating, I just had to know what was gonna happen next. I can't wait to read the last book.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|One of the best series on Amazon Prime Instant. I give it 6 stars but had to deduct one because this is the final season.
0307593312|1.0|I am disappointed by 1Q84.<br /><br />My thought while reading this novel was that there must be something that I was missing... like a point. I had thought to put the book down and erase it from my memory many times... but I could not. Like the characters in the book, I was stuck on a path of self destruction and nearly ended my life before finishing the journey... I finished.<br /><br />I have no interest in any of the characters of this novel besides Aomame and I am only interested in her because she reminds me of someone else. It is sad when every character has been so completely destroyed as to leave no interesting features behind. But there we have it.<br /><br />I do not blame Mr Murrakami for this novel... I admire him for finishing it, himself. I also admire the translator for the same feat. I could not have written this novel nor could I have asked someone else to translate or publish this novel. I thought for many chapters that the fault may lie with the translator but that was not the case. I had wanted to believe that Mr Murakami could not have produced such a low-grade work... it had to be the fault of another. I also imagined that sentiment may have been the point to the novel. But, now, I realize it was a decent short story that was contrived to be more.<br /><br />Mr Murakami, I apologize. It is not your fault your novel is disappointment to me... it is my fault for having read it with hope instead of putting it down.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great view and can tell at a glance. Never need to worry about losing my time because of a dead battery. What a great idea.
B000SL1Q2C|4.0|A great fantasy and Love story with a lot of fun in it as well.  If you love beautiful Horses, landscapes and romance, this is a movie to not miss.
B00AA7V2Z0|4.0|There's really no other way to describe the show. Haunting and mesmerizing.  After a few episodes I thought to myself that the show was too odd, yet when I went to watch something else, I was sucked right back in. The acting is superb and each character well developed with flashback back stories so you are drawn to their respective tragedies and unique psychosis.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This is a well written book involving several characters that are reminders of the past for one person . It makes you want to read what happened and why. I would recommend it .
B000GOVHN4|5.0|I didn't know what to expect and hadn't heard anything about this movie. I like Elijah Wood in &#34;Wilfred&#34; so I wanted to see more of his work. He was good, the supporting cast was very good, and I thought the dialogue was a treasure. I am impressed by Liev Shreiber's directing. The movie undergoes an odd progression of highly humorous to very sorrowful. I debated between 4 or 5 stars but, overall, I am glad that I saw this movie, so 5 stars.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|While this is a different take on the original film, Colin Farrell makes a much better hero than Arnold did, and the graphics are fantastic.  Definately worth the money.
B0030F5W5K|5.0|I am amazed that we have the technology to see Patrick Swayze's ghost make love to a never aging Demi Moore.<br /> I would love to see them use this technology on Brandon Lee's ghost for a Crow sequel.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game.  I really enjoy it. its great to pass time and is challengeing.  its new and simalar to the first one.  its really fun
B00AW28HF6|5.0|Once I started I didn't want to put it down until all the pieces came together. The informative flashbacks provide tension release for the building plot development. Action description gives one a 'being there' feeling. I was left wondering what the author' sources were - some events seem a premonition of what has transpired in reality. The final words...'The End' seem unnecessary and I hope it's not. Am looking forward to further development of this story line.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best game ever I hope they have a Temple Run 3. I think you'll going to enjoy it.
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|It is just stupid. Doesn't even look for a real network. Plus you need to download another app to use it. WASTE OF TIME
B000J159N8|4.0|Mel Gibson might be a little strange, but he does work hard at his movies and with that said this movie is worth your time and I thank you will enjoy it.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game. It has been the top game for my family. It helps with concentration and reaction time. My favorite part is when you have to hover on your hoverboard on the top of the trains!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|There is a couple problems that I have come across while trying to start it up, But other then that my horse is a good and fun game.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|This game use to be my favorite until it stopped working and had to delete it and install it again and LOST everything!  I was on level 53 &amp; I am now in level 7! I should get credited for everything! So sick to my stomach having to start over!
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|More of a guy movie most girls I know would not like this movie. great movie for guys. Funny and at the same time stupid.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Thus a very exquisite read, though not recommended for the ignorant types of people.....<br />hahahahahahahahahahaha I'm just kidding I'm not that smart but the dictionary is still wwwaaayyyy cool XD
B002F3BOSM|5.0|Of course, the music is wonderful.  This minor classic from the 60s still wears well.  Then, the music on this disc was at the center of the counterculture revolution, albeit the softer side of that revolution.  Now, with those times in abeyance or irrelevant, the album stands solely on its purely musical feet.  The songs are well-crafted, the vocals beautiful and heartfelt.  This remastering isn't perfect, but it's a real improvement.  Yes, the highs seems to be somewhat muted, and the bass and mid-range emphasized, but this gives the recording more oomph down low and more body to the vocals.  In fact, with the too-bright high notes gone, listening is more enjoyable.  The vocal parts are better separated, the blending of the harmonies more rounded, and the mix of vocals and instrumentation more agreeable.  I'd like even more bass though, and the drums still seem thin at times.  I could stand a bit more air in the overall mix too, but I might be complaining about my present system's limitations.  Back in the day few had a system then that could adequately reproduce the bass and drums as they were originally recorded, so the low end of things was consciously limited by producers and engineers.  I picked this vinyl up at Hastings for $11.99.  Money well-spent.  I've been enjoying this disc for the last three days.  It's a wonderful record.  I love that beautiful sound Stills gets out of his guitar on \\"Wooden Ships,\\" smooth and melodic and despairing, perfect for a post-apocalyptic meeting of survivors.  \\"Hey, can I have some of your purple berries? / Yes, I've been eating them for six or seven weeks now. Haven't got sick once. / Probably keep us both alive . . .\\"  The way that exchange of voices works as a single melodic line is one of the numerous examples of subtle song-craft throughout this record.  Did I say minor classic from the 60s?  Right now I'm thinking one of the best records to come out of a period silly with great records.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|really like it its got cool dragons really recommend it for kids you could do it like your taking care of a dog
B000IDEQTK|5.0|Helen Hunt captures your attention from the start of the movie. Not too sure guys would like this but I think most ladies can relate in one way or another.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|After all these years, it was nice to see the band back together for a single show, especially in honor of a business friend who recently passed away. This is a much better scenario then the bands who hit the road for a reunion tour with or without the members who made up the band while they were in their heyday. It's rather annoying when a band member reassembles his or her troupe with a fill in cast and the one guy who puts this show together is the only member of the original line-up.<br />  Not so with Led Zeppelin. The only member who wasn't present was John Bonham, and his death was the reason for the disbanding. It was exceptionally nice to see his son Jason sitting in with Page, Plant and Jones.<br />  The show starts out a little slow. The first three songs seem like the boys are just warming up. When they start into &#34;In My Time of Dying&#34;, the stakes are raised by a song which requires them to be precise, and they respond perfectly. Through the changes and the bridges, the band is well in sync. They follow with a bit of a surprise in &#34;For Your Life&#34; from Presence, then after that rip through &#34;Trampled Under Foot&#34; and &#34;Nobody's Fault But Mine&#34;, which again show the band in perfect timing. Everything is working. From there they go back to the old standards, or as Robert Plant explains, &#34;Songs you have to play.&#34;<br />In particular, for me, was &#34;Kashmir&#34;. I had chills running through me.<br />  I've always been a little intrigued by Jimmy Page. He's undeniably a spectacular guitar player, but he goes a step further by bringing sounds out of his instrument that are quite unique. It was also very refreshing to see that Robert Plant wasn't strutting around the stage like some over-amped testosterone droid as he did in &#34;The Song Remains the Same&#34;. With the release of this package, there were numerous media statements which included Page being quoted as saying that a reunion tour had been considered, but couldn't be worked out because of some of the members schedules. I&#34;d say just as well, because sometimes, a single dose of nostalgia can be negatively diluted by over doing it.
B008Y6WPXC|2.0|Movie is clearly made for a paycheck, but it is somewhat entertaining and the fights are done OK. Great cast for this kind of movie.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Like Starship troopers but even more philosophical. I liked the action, of course, but also the well thought-out universe and the fact that Scalzi's characters were well-rounded and thoughtful.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show.  I am addicted.  Dreading the day I am caught up and have to wait week to week to see each episode.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book will be a true classic and is one of the best books I've read. If only they add one more word
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very attractive display, pleasant formatting, ease of pinning, commenting, liking, access to websites attached to pins, LOVE all the various types of media displayed by diverse artists !!!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Wanted to find out how they got the Bully.  It was ok but not great.  Could have covered more of what they found.  Charlie
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Good graphics, only wish you could buy more things with less coins :) fun way to be distracted and pass the time especially if you love horses!
B003O86FMW|3.0|I enjoyed it but felt behaps the two final books should have been combined, alhough I am looking forward to Mockingjay.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|While the age of reading great classic literature seems to be fading away, Treasure Island is one of those novels that just won't quit. Because of the dialect used, it is sometimes a difficult read for students, but still worth the effort.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Josh Groban continues to prove he is one of classical-crossover's masters. Over the course of five albums (six if you include [[ASIN:B000V6Z0XA Noel]]), Groban continues to appeal to a wide audience reaping the benefits of both critical and commercial success. February 2013's [[ASIN:B00A9T1HUO All That Echoes]] finds no 'fall-off' from everyone's favorite 'popera' star.  Groban doesn't miss a beat over the effort's 12 tracks - some originals and some covers.<br /><br />Promo single \\"Brave\\", an original, feels like a pop song, only with more classical cues than your standard pop number.  The anthemic refrain is a highlight, in which Groban sings: \\"You wanna run away run away and you can say / that it can't be so / you wanna look away look away / but you stay cause it's all so close...\\" Instrumentally, the marching snare definitely stands out.  \\"False Alarm\\" also stands out.  Here, Groban adds some falsetto.  The production continues to suit the singer's pop/classical sensibilities, featuring a thoughtful tandem of strings (arranged by David Campbell), piano/keyboards, and guitar.<br /><br />\\"Falling Slowly\\", the first cover of the effort, appears from the [[ASIN:B000PFU7OO Once]] soundtrack. Groban does the Academy-award winning number justice, though it's less alluring than the two originals that precede.  \\"She Moved Through The Fair\\" is much more captivating, even given its slow tempo and mysterious nature.  A traditional cut, producer Rob Cavallo arranges.  Groban sounds magnificent, and the cut itself grows dynamically little by little while pulling back on the third verse.  Honestly, how many cuts can you name featuring instrumentation including Uilleann Pipes? Exactly.<br /><br />\\"Below The Line\\", another original, is quicker than \\"She Moved Through The Fair\\".  \\"Below The Line\\" possessing some musical similarities to opening cut\\"Brave\\".  Horns (arranged by Rashawn Ross and Jerry Hey), add some lovely spice.  Groban delves into languages - specifically Italian - on the fine \\"E Ti Prometter&oacute;\\", one of two cuts produced by Lester Mendez. \\"E Ti Prometter&oacute;\\" translate in English to \\"I Promise You\\".  Laura Pausini guests vocally, blending well with Groban.  As with everything else, it is solid, pleasant, and enjoyable.<br /><br />Glen Campbell covered the Jimmy Webb penned \\"The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress\\" back in 1974.  Groban revisits it in 2013, yielding one of the efforts crowning achievements. Groban's vocal tone is pure and genuine.  He contrasts on the second Lester Mendez production, \\"Un Alma Mas\\", which features jazz standout Arturo Sandoval.  Sandoval's trumpet contributions are thoughtful, accentuating the Latin arrangement and complementing Groban's undeniable pipes.<br /><br />\\"Happy in Heartache\\" proceeds solidly, lacking the exceptionality of the best.  But a superb cover of Dutch band Choir of Young Believer's \\"Hollow Talk\\" (from album [[ASIN:B002G3DTYI This Is for the White in Your Eyes]]), eliminates all improprieties.  Groban makes a cut many are unaware of new, favorite addition to the playlist.  Penultimate original \\"Sincera\\" (Sincere) continues with great consistency while the Stevie Wonder cover \\"I Believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever)\\" concludes the effort on a high note.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00A9T1HUO All That Echoes]] is another enjoyable classical-crossover effort from Josh Groban. Easy to listen to and relaxing, Groban possesses all the right moves when delivering an album. 4 stars.on the fine \\"E Ti Prometteró\\", one of two cuts produced by Lester Mendez. \\"E Ti Prometteró\\" translate in English to \\"I Promise You\\".

B00APJLFEG|5.0|This was a good take on the other side of monsters. Very funny and clever. Love Adam Sandler in this type of comedy. Great cast all the way down.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I chose  this rating because this book requires a lot of  thought and understanding of what was going on. I liked the fact that there were many things to think about and what you would do in situations that Charlie was in, but at times it became a very slow read. I would recommend this book to young adults who understand and comprehend books easily.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Very reminiscent of the old Indiana Jones movies. It was very fun to watch. The graphics are a perfect mix of realistic and cartoonish. The drunk captain is an amazing character
B007P06DOK|5.0|A wonderful album that was controversial when it was released, because of the boycott imposed on S. Africa because of apartheid.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I absolutely love both the musical and the movie. I decided to read the book to see how Hugo wrote the scenes that have been set so beautifully to music. It has been 45  years since I last read any of the great books of Western Literature. I was enthralled by Hugo's use of language, the marvelous descriptions and the way in which he shows each of the main characters struggle with their inner-selves. The book also gave me a much better understanding of why Russell Crowe was so stiff and stoic as Javert. He played the character as Hugo wrote it. I strongly recommend reading this book. My wife says it is even better in french, if one is able.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|1986PG13: Soo love the \\"Common Sense Age 14\\" rating! Should be mandatory viewing for the entire planet of uptight heavies who could use a genuine dose of lightening up! MFJLabs 5x Cult Classic
B009NPA3Y6|5.0|I bought this product as a gift for my mom, so i can't really give a proper review. I really like the Stones and the track listing looked great, and it came a few days before the estimated delivery!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I didn't realize that the main characters were teenagers when I purchased this book, but I did enjoy it.  It was well written with complex characters and a good plot.  I won't go into a more detailed description of the plot, but be assured that the book ends well with a sense of justice.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was the most gripping book, i couldn't put it down. Loved the story line and how each character was developed. Must read!
0345803493|5.0|This book was definitely worth reading.  Fifty Shades Darker delivered what I had anticipated.  The ending inspired the purchase of the third in the series.  Loved it from front to back cover.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Wonderful movie!  Itis fun, entertaining, and full of little details. It is one we can watch over again and again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin dozer is a fun strangely addicting game. I really like how it doesn't make you wait too long to get another coin .  And the prizes are cool.  I highly recommend this game because it is a great way to spend time when you're bored
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I loooove her voice she is amazing and the words just blew me away. My fav are my kind of love, next to me, breaking the law, maybe, suitcase, river and where I sleep. I cant wait to continue her career I cant even believe she is not up for a grammy for best new artist
B001CDZZI6|5.0|This book empowers you to evaluate your Strengths and create a career / life that plays to them.<br /><br />A strength is defined as something your are good at AND makes you feel strong.<br /><br />I found when I took a job based on my strengths and purposefully did more work in the areas of my strengths, not only did I start loving my job more; my work was recognized by others.
B0044IABFS|4.0|Terrific show but it had to end - the events depicted were growing increasingly more improbable and while I enjoyed the exotic locales, tension, and dramatic escapes the show simply couldn't continue because the events were just too implausible.
6305428271|5.0|I love this movie because it is inspirational. The actors and the story it self is amazing . Never give up for your dreams . A must have movie
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Haven't read since highschool,I have thourghly enjoyed revisiting the classic tale. Dark and frighting, the cloying feeling of being trapped and helpless.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like it so far. I have played the other virtual city games. I love that you don't need internet to play it like you do with most games similar to this. But the investment point system is very annoying. I will not spend my real life money on fake points in a game. They made it so you have to to do what you want in the game. I can't expand if those my city's environment score.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Even better than Season 1.  Every episode leaves you wanting more.  Great series.  Can't wait to shre it with our daughter and grand daughters, the 11 year old is already in love with Pride and Prejudice.  Downtown Abbey is a 20th century version of Pride and Prejudice.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I downloaded this on a complete whim. And I had a ball with it. There are a few problems with the structure at times but other than that it's just plain engaging and fun. It drew me in from the first sentence and had me completely engaged until the end.
B005LAIIPS|2.0|If following the last Bourne kept going back to people that should have been in jail and apparently they weren't and accusing Pamela Landy of treason. Their is too much that has not been explained
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run  2 is so awesome It is such a great game! It is better than temple run. I love it!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We lived in England for 5years and LOVE this series.  Just captivating!!!!!  We are taking our grand daughters to the UK this summer and plan to add Highclere Castle to the itinerary.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i love this game. great graphics and goals, it is very addicting. the only complaint i have is a gem one. you have to buy or earn gems, and i find that very frustrating when i really want something that costs gems. overall, this game rocks.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Excellent Movie Good for everybody, shows what really happened and the sacrifices that were made for this country to survive
B000I0QL82|3.0|This is what you expect to see when you have the magnificent dancing of Fred Astaire -- pure joy!  I'm just not a big fan of Bing Crosby but Marjorie Reynolds was surprisingly talented.  I didn't know that she could dance. If we could see more of Mr. Astaire's dancing and have a little less of Bing Crosby &#34;crooning&#34; bah-bah-bah-boo I would have enjoyed the movie much, much more.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|This \\"movie\\" (if you could call it a movie) is nothing more then one action sean after another. Their is NO story or plot what so ever that makes any kind of sence. If I had seen this movie when it came out I would have left and demanded my money back. About half way through the movie I was HOPPING they would kill alice so their would be at least some ending to this crap they keep putting out their (but we all know the death of a main character in no way stops horable writting). The ONLY reason why I am giving this 2 stars and not just 1 was because the intro to the movie was different and I liked it, Also the last 2 min when they where at DC and it show how bad off the human race was that look really cool and I wish they would have shown more of the only good part of this movie.<br /><br />Do your self a favor and save your money and watch it when you can see it on cable for free.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|From the first page to the last, the characters remain true<br />to themselves. I was rooting for the characters to triumph<br />and in a way they did by...remaining true to themselves.<br />I really liked this book alot
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I was carried heart and soul into this story and it remains with me still.  The characters are so alive I was not surprised at all by Grissom's divulging how she met them at the end of the book.  Excellent story written with compelling narrative and description.  Loved living within it for a time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful series. I  especially like Maggie Smith's role.  She has some really hilarious comments.. I would recommend this series to anyone.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great story ,line good acting ,great actors , makes you wonder if there is other life out there and if they would be friendly or not.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|After reading this book by MacLaine's daughter, I<br />threw out my entire collection of books written by<br />MacLaine. Anyone who was such a cold, self centered<br />and neglectful mother is hardly an evolved &#34;soul&#34; to be<br />admired. Given her parentage (both mommy and<br />daddy are truly horrors) I marvel that Parker not<br />o ly survived by seemingly prevailed
B0037NVM2C|4.0|Without a doubt this a great movie and one of the best SciFi movies. The quality of this version is very nice - however what qualifies for a director's cut these days seems to be lacking.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game!  Endless fun for all ages. Easy to play. Allows for creativity.  Suggestions for the developers: add enchantments and caves.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|It had it's action, but seemed to get off track somewhat and didn't know where it was going and then back
B0078N2MTE|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie not really expecting it to be that great, just something to watch. We loved the movie and the ending was good. I would recommend.
B00821OX98|3.0|This is kind of a post-apocalyptic space invasion drama.  I'm a sci-fi buff and I was prepared to like this show, but it's produced by Steven Spielberg and it is really kid oriented.  Everything is tied back to kids and family - I don't think it is aimed at adults.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I AM ADDICTED!to this game! Whoever made this game must be cool. It beats temple run any day. Also thank you tiffany for showing this to me.
B000OCXI3K|1.0|The movie was great..........I honestly couldn't keep my eyes open to read this. Lucky for the author they had Johnny Depp and Juliet Binoche for the main characters. Just goes to show, don't judge a book by it's cover.
B005VPRDAY|4.0|This is a small set of Lego's, but pretty girl colors. My granddaughter is 5 years old. I had to build them with her because she was still a bit young and hasn't used a lot of Lego's. Would probably be fine for an experienced Lego builder though.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Beautifully acted, beautifully filmed.  Wonderful movie.  An exciting story of love and revenge, honor and betrayal. I highly recommend this movie
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Classic Clancy, multiple seemingly unrelated scenarios gradually woven together culminating in fast moving action towards a suspensful conclusion with elements of surprise right up to the last paragraph.  Clancy always seems to surround his stories with tecnical subjects that fascinate him and which he researches in great detail.  He educates the reader while weaving technical detail into the plot in a manner that makes a great read all that more interesting.  If you enjoyed Clancy's Jack Ryan novels for decades as I have, this one certainly won't fail to meet your expectations.  Buy it.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this story. It's beautifully written and captures your attention from the first word to the last. Kate Morton is a wonderful story teller and I have now bought 2 other books of hers and I am so excited to read them!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I watched this movie with my teenage daughter, and we both loved it! Exceptional story line and great quality. I would highly recommend this movie.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I have enjoyed reading this gives me a good back ground for one of the great rock lirasist of my generation.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Every year Vince Flynn gives us another chapter in the life of Mitch Rapp.  Hero's, outside the public eye saving America, we hope or want to really exist.  I've read everything Flynn has written and The Last Man is as good as any of his previous books.  Plenty of suspense, action, and outcomes to satisfy our desire for triumph over evil.  Escape with a quick, fun read.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Great movie, the whole group is great, this one falls right in line and is just as good as the rest.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Excellent writing, excellent acting, and compelling characters.  This show is so compelling to watch. Downton Abbey is a real treat.
B00AQMSJI2|1.0|Cute game, but it's all about the money.  Prices escalate quickly and you don't make any more money so it takes forever to earn the littlest thing.  Unless of course, you're willing to spend actual money.  They rob you blind...like real pirates.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This was a very engrossing and educational read.  There wasn't as clear a delineation between the good and the bad characters as other books, however, I can see how this sets up the sequel to this book.  Compared to most books this would be a 5 star, but compared to other Follett novels I give it a 4 star, as I have found others more entertaining.  Still a must read for WW I buffs and Follett fans.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I watched this movie at the ladies request and it turned out to be a good movie. Check it out.
B000SLP4SE|1.0|Boring??? Really no story line here .. This is absolutely the most boring movie I have ever seen.. Don't rent it
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This game is  pretty fun. You take your little stickman and go find your other stickman friend. You also find puzzle pieces and pages for your book. There are some hard levels where you have to think to figure out how to pass them. It only has a certain amount of levels, and then you`re done with the game. It has a few secret levels, but  other then that it`s pretty quick to play. I wouldn`t pay 2 bucks for it.
B0095P29EG|5.0|The must watch movie before watching the Avengers.  The storyline lays a good foundation and ties the Thor, Captain America, Hulk, characters.  Natalie was gorgeous as usual.  Movie plot is consistent with comic books.  Saving humanity is always a good ending for a movie.  This movie delivers action and more.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Come on, Do I really have to leave a review?  It's Batman enough said.  This ones good enough to buy.
B00821OX98|5.0|One of most enjoyable in sci-fi  right now, but some how is too little alieans, however is 5 stars for me.
1451695195|4.0|Big surprise from a scientist.  Bowled me over when he revealed he had traveled in the hereafter with a sister he had never met.  That nails it for me!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is a tremendous source of comfort to those who have experienced loss. Personally, I have always believed in Heaven, but having it validated by a neurosurgeon that actually experienced it was wonderful.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|First off this movie definately isn't for children..only order this movie if you wanna laugh your a$$ off.  I bought this movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|the load time is  a little agrivating, but its fun,realistic,( addicting) and best of all FREE! ive looked online before for the &quot;perfect&quot; horse game... but they usually are too not free or require a sign up! this one is near all around perfect.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|this show is fantastic... it sucks you in - so make sure you've got time to invest because you're not gonna want to quit watching.
0062073192|5.0|this was a gift for my granddaughter and loves all the supernatural tv shows and she said this was what she likes.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|The blonde in this movie is hot so is salma.  If you want to see a movie with a lot of T N A this is your movie, doesn't help that it's a great story aswell.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I'm not exactly what you would call a die hard Star Trek fan but i do enjoy a well written and performed sci-fi  show. Though this show takes place in the area just after the once set in the Star Trek: First Contact movie, it works well in filling and bridging the gaps between different star trek story lines. All and all a good and entertaining show to watch.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my daughter.  She has a greater understanding and respect for all those who have served and continue to serve in the present day.
0062103377|4.0|as this was a gift for my granddaughter,i did not read, but she loves books like this. she said it was good.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great movie for a redneck, I enjoyed it.  This is a good testament to how things went down in the old days.
B009XPGJYY|5.0|This soap opera on wheels continues with more double-crossing, bike riding, thug-killing thrills.  If nothing else, SOA makes me reconsider any need to join a MC that I might have once harbored.  It just doesn't seem like much fun for them, but it is great escapist fun for us to watch.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love it get get get get it u get all kinds of stuff and its kinds like motion love it
B000OLGCI4|2.0|Happy came in nice package brand new disk but i wish they would have told me they were fake. There cheaper at the flea market
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel Washington and Jon Goodman are studs in this movie, I would highly recommend you check it out.  This movie is based on a true story and the ending is the best.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Quality was poor. Movie stopped several times and had to restart. Circle in middle of screen stopped movie and took several minutes to restart.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I couldnt stop watching.<br />Spent way too many late nights trying to race to the end...<br />Addicting, mesmerizing, surprizing, wonderful cast
B009XY5G80|4.0|Virginia Woolf's tour de force bears rereading for the lyrical flights of language here and there, but especially for the whimsical story of the four hundred year life of Orlando, a man for the first couple of hundred years or so, and then a woman, but always Orlando, and always an English Lord.
B006Z21ZGK|5.0|I love the image quality and the sound quality. Concert is fantastic. If you are a Maiden fan, it's a must have it
B0095P2YXC|5.0|Usually when there is a continuation of movies after you seen the first you get bored but Saw VII The Final Chapter was great
