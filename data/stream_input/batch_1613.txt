B008MG1E4A|3.0|Reading existing reviews for this book, it seems that the majority fall under two categories:<br /><br />1) Those that are reviewing the book on the basis of the heroism and skill of the Navy SEALs that killed Osama Bin Laden (4-5 stars)<br /><br />2) Those that are reviewing the author and the honor (or lack thereof) of publishing this book (1-2 stars)<br /><br />However, very few people review the actual book itself.<br /><br />I'm actually a modern military history buff, and thought going in (politics aside) that I would quite enjoy this book. I didn't (at least, not as much as I thought I should have). Here are the reasons:<br /><br />1) The writing style is very simplistic (really, wouldn't put it past a 5th or 6th grade reading level). This could work in some books, but really gets old very quickly in this one.<br /><br />2) Perhaps as a result of the auhtor's literary limitations, the recounting of his training as a Navy SEAL lacks all the raw emotion you would expect from an experience so personally challenging and raw.<br /><br />3) There is more detail in this book than previously published accounts, but if you've already read the New Yorker article describing the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden (highly recommended reading), I figure you've captured 70-80% of the truly interesting information captured in the book, but in a much more interesting wrapper.<br /><br />If you want the \\"best\\" recounting of the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, go find the New Yorker article. If you want an excellent recounting of Navy SEAL training, then you owe it to yourself to read [[ASIN:B000QRIGLC Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10]], which is in my opinion a much better book overall.<br /><br />Three stars because in the end the story of how Osama Bin Laden was killed is still an important piece of history, and this book is a cornerstone in the telling of that story.

B0072GPQNG|2.0|When it comes to knowing what buttons to push to get an audience to experience a certain emotion,  I can't now think of a director better at that than Steven Spielberg.<br />And once he's figured that out,  few are better at getting it up on the screen in full, state-of-the-art, cinematic splendor.  Very often, though,  I feel as if he's being too crafty, too manipulative, and too obvious.  Take, for example (spoiler alert!), the happy ending of \\"War Horse.\\"  I felt like saying, \\"Jeez... ease up a bit, Steven,\\" when he set it against a spectacular, melting, water color sunset... just in case, maybe, some in the audience might not get that it was, in fact, a happy ending.<br />I also have at least one or two other bones to pick with \\"War Horse.\\"  I thought Mr. Spielberg clearly trivialized and glossed over the unprecedented brutality of WWI, just for the sake of the feel-good story he wanted to tell.  And it was an insult to my intelligence that he asked the audience to believe that gassed, maimed and psychologically ravaged soldiers (from both sides) would be able to shove all those horrors into some corner of their consciousnesses just to care about the plight of a horse.  Sorry... that was a bit too much artistic license for my tastes.<br />Nevertheless, I have to admit that from the opening scenes, I cared about and rooted for Joey (the name of the war horse). But, then, I believe that was because I'm into horses... not due to any movie-making skills that Mr. Spielberg may or may not possess.  Truthfully, if I didn't love horses as much as I do,  I would have given this movie a single star since it was too contrived by at least several furlongs (eighths of a mile for those of you unfamiliar with horse racing).

030758836X|5.0|I love this book. It's definitely going in my \\"favorites\\" list. It's a page-turner and I couldn't put it down. I also didn't want it to end. It's one of those books I just wanted to live in. I wanted to read and read and read and never stop.<br /><br />I found the ending a tad anti-climactic though. Not sure exactly what I was hoping for or looking for, but it didn't surprise or shock, it didn't leave me sitting there with my mouth open, unable to believe THAT happened. Some books, when they end, I just sit there staring at the closed cover. I can't believe how it ended, how the author could pull everything together in a way that leaves me amazed. Didn't happen here.<br /><br />Still a great book though, a solid and exciting story. Love it and I will definitely recommend it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Mezmarizing.  Logic game that builds in difficulty.  Music adds to the effect.  Simple directions yet tricky puzzles.  I really LOVE this game.

B002SSUQFG|3.0|The watch is okay. I was a little disappointed when I first got it because it is way smaller than I expected, but that's on me. I should have researched more. Another thing I'm not to thrilled about is the fact that if you don't wear for a day or so you have to set it. But watch is well built and tough good for my work (firefighter/emt). But the fellas will poke some fun @the you because it's the size of a woman's watch. My wife has been making jokes because her watch is bigger. But as far as the seller they were excellent.

My naivety was shattered to learn how former and current Presidents interact behind the scenes to help each other through tough political times both nationally and internationally.  The Presidents Club really is a unique and, I believe, a necessary quid pro quo arrangement between the men who know all the \\"secrets.\\"

They even have sounds that one wouldn't think of such as humming, perfect for babies! I hooked up my speakers and run it on low at night and it sets such a wonderful sleeping environment, just wonderful. I like this app so much that I will probably end up upgrading the app to receive even more sounds. I would definitely recommend this app to others and more I encourage others to try it, I think they will be happy.

B0090SI3CA|3.0|Tracy Letts' brilliant black stage comedy has been made darker, bloodier and not quite so funny in this NC-17 collaboration with director William Friedkin. I loved the devastatingly funny and audacious stage play but found myself uncomfortable with a number of scenes in the movie. Why is it necessary to ramp up the sex, violence and gore for movies? I guess Friedkin will never learn that overkill is overrated.<br /><br />The movie is extremely well-acted, so I can't complain about this sterling cast:<br />  * Matthew McConaughey (&quot;Magic Mike&quot;) continues to grow as an actor. As Joe, the cop who takes &quot;side jobs,&quot; he is chillingly effective, particularly as you notice his courtly manners, good grammar and icy no-nonsense style.<br />  * Emile Hirsch (&quot;Savages&quot;) is Chris, the dumb cluck who owes more debts than he can ever repay. His reaction goes from petulance to panic. It's his solution, an insurance scam, that starts things rolling. Hirsch gets better and better.<br />  * Juno Temple (&quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;) is Dottie, the brain-damaged young woman who serves as the family's &quot;retainer&quot; for her brother's deal. There is never a moment when we doubt her intellectual limitations, and she makes a good tuna casserole.<br />  * Thomas Hayden Church (&quot;We Bought a Zoo&quot;), sporting the world's scraggliest beard, is Ansel, the cuckold father of Dottie and Chris. He is so bewildered and terrorized he can't even help himself!<br />  * Gina Gershon (&quot;How to Make it in America&quot;) is Sharla, Ansel's faithless wife.<br /><br />As was true in the stage play, the most effective elements in this story are the ones we DON'T see, which is why I am so disappointed by all of the things we DO see: Lots of violent beatings, gun play, and prolonged sexual innuendo. At least with the DVD from Amazon.com, you can use the fast forward.

B0083H6AQA|5.0|Having read this book before the movie came out, I was curious to see just how manipulative and hateful George DuRoy would be on screen.  In the book, I wanted to stone him.  In the movie though, I felt different.  Seeing him watch others dining in luxury while he had a dried crust of bread to share with the roaches, gave me a little sympathy for our dastardly womanizing cad.  There was no broodiness to our main character; no sullen unfeeling man at all.  His interaction with Kristen Scott Thomas had me cowering in my seat while his tenderness with Christina Ricci made me think he was no cad at all.  There were some parts that were in the book that I would have liked to see in the film, too bad those were left on the cutting room floor.  By the time this movie was finished, I was rooting for the bad guy.  How's that for the power of cinema?  I recommend it for those who love a good period film; the costuming is perfect, the details do not go un-noticed.  Robert Pattinson is great as the lead and the fact that he shares this film with three lovely and talented actresses alone makes it worth purchasing.
0307957837|5.0|I am not a huge 'fantasy' story fan. I liked the Harry Potter series and thats about it. However, this trilogy was written so well, I couldn't put it down. I'm reading the BBCs top 100 books and this trilogy was pretty much the first one on the list so I thought I'd start there.  I can see why it made the list! From the first page, there was action, adventure and mystery all put together by believable characters that you love to love, or love to hate.  A must read for any young adult or adult in general (I'm in my 30s).
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|best application ever<br />love the syncing.<br />love that you can use it on a kindle.<br />great for making shopping lists
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book is a grabber!  As the kindle only tells you percentages of how far you are, I did not focus on how long the book was.  This worked for me, so I let myself focus more on what the concept really was.<br /><br />Steven King is a master in pulling you into believing that the bizarre possibilities in this book could really be happening in reality.  I love the characters and enjoyed the comparisons between the '60's and now.  It is truly a<br />book that keeps you on the edge of reality and fiction!  Loved it!
B005FISBTO|3.0|There is no spoiler in this review... I love Dexter and season 6 did not disappoint me.  HOWEVER. When you place these disks in your player for the first time, Showtime runs a mandatory commercial that shows highlights of all its favorite shows, including Dexter.  Some idiot decided to include the season 6 conclusion/cliffhanger in it's own commercial. This is an EXTREME SPOILER.  If you do not know how season 6 ends, I advise each time this Showtime commercial runs that you close your eyes and plug your ears (or leave the room) for about 2 or 3 minutes.  The Dexter top menu will automatically load after the commercial is complete.  I would give the disk set 5 stars if Showtime did not spoil the season for me.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Well written, highly entertaining.  Can't wait to pick it up each time.  Told from two points of view, this is a great summer read.
B001JAFYFG|3.0|\\"Logan's Run\\" (1976), recently released to Blu-ray, has been around for a long time in the earlier formats and is generally regarded as an OK but not great sci-fi film.  It's a fairly interesting story of a future society -- \\"sometime in the twenty-third century\\" -- living luxuriously in a huge city under a sealed dome.  The citizens have been conditioned to believe that shortly before reaching the age of 30 they are eligible to be reborn (\\"renewed\\") by participating in a sort of religious ritual known as \\"Carousel\\" in which, after being bodily destroyed, they would be \\"renewed\\" as a baby to start a new life.  The hook here, of course, is that they are not renewed at all but are simply eliminated as a means to keep the population constant and in balance. This is what is known as the \\"gimmick.\\"  Any citizen trying to escape from the dome is designated to be a \\"runner\\" and is hunted down by government agents called \\"Sandmen\\" and, if apprehended, immediately killed which puts an abrupt end to his or her evening plans.<br /><br />The story bears a resemblance to the much later Michael Bay film \\"The Island\\" (2005) and Arthur C. Clarke's famous novel, \\"The City and the Stars\\" which I've always thought would make a very good picture.  It's fairly easy to guess how the film turns out, but I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, although there can't be too many of them by now.<br /><br />What I had forgotten was that this film was photographed in Todd-AO wide-screen and looks absolutely splendid in the Blu-ray edition.  The film's special effects are limited pretty much to the nicely fashioned miniatures of \\"The City.\\"  The only fly in the ointment there is that the water in the lakes of the city ripples too quickly and immediately gives it away as being a miniature.  If these scenes had been shot using a high speed camera that problem could have been minimized.  However it's possible that high-speed Todd-AO cameras were not available. The film's strong points are the imaginatively designed sets and a good cast: Michael York, Jenny Agutter, Richard Jordan, Peter Ustinov, Farrah Fawcett-Majors and Roscoe Lee Browne.  Michael Anderson, Jr., the director's son also appears briefly in the film.  There is a nice orchestral score augmented by electronic sounds by Jerry Goldsmith.  I had seen the film a few times in the earlier formats, but the Blu-ray version completely \\"renewed\\" my appreciation of it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|if you're in for a hot hot hot novel to read, you're in for a treat. but story-wise it has its exciting parts too.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|What a lovely game.  Challenging,  satisfying,  and a joy to behold. A worthy successor to the original. Buy them both and enjoy.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a very good movie... I bought it, and I won't buy just any movie.  My criteria for spending and investing more than the money for tickets to see a movie to begin with, to decide to commit more money to own any movie, is that it must highly enjoyable to watch the movie in question... This movie meets everyone in my family's criteria for repeated viewing. True, maybe some more than others, but nonetheless it is very enjoyable to see more than once and therefore own.  It is a well done movie, with well voiced/acted, high quality animation, and a funny, smart, little tug at your heartstrings plot....  A solid B+ in my opinion.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run its awesome.  great game to play if your bord or even for a compition. go temple run
B002DKGWSE|4.0|If you haven't seen The Virgin Spring then it's probably a good idea to see Last House On The Left first. If you have already seen Bergman's classic then you will more than likely be disappointed by Craven's attempt in the original or the remake.<br /><br />Compared to the other big remake, I Spit On Your Grave, this one is far superior. There is even the addition of a hospital scene to give you some back story about Mari's father. This also helps everything add up perfectly when he has to operate on one of the thugs and his own daughter towards the end.<br /><br />This is simply a much tighter and slicker version of the original although the Sadie character in the original was played a lot more maliciously by Jeramie Rain while 'Krug' in this version is a little too pretty-boy compared to David Hess so only 4 stars. Obviously the acting is going to be a lot better overall than decades ago because Craven has a lot more cash to spend on the remake than he did for the original.<br /><br />The addition of a fourth antagonist was a surprise in the first act but by the end you realise how essential he is to the plot overall.<br /><br />Craven clearly still had a pretty tight grip on the reins creatively to make sure all the details locked in like a well oiled machine. He was especially careful to show how much of a masterful swimmer Mari is in the opening scenes. This seemingly trivial detail is anything but though because she just makes it back home, after being beaten, raped and finally shot, obviously due to her many years of dedicated training in the pool etc.<br /><br />While I Spit On Your Grave in remake is seriously flawed, (see my review), this one is far more successful. The exclusion of the 'castration' scene will more than likely annoy fans of the original but the 'waste disposal' and 'microwave' scenes should be enough of a compromise.<br /><br />Some people complain about the music in the original but a lot of the music (mostly by Hess himself) including the theme is clearly a major influence for bands like Zero 7, Kaki King and the like.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I'm not going to review the functionality of this device.  Despite everything I write below, I've already decided that the G13 is everything I hoped it would be.  I will use it for years to come and marvel at how it makes my life easier.<br /><br />The reason I felt compelled to write a review is that I'm disappointed in the ergonomics of this device.  For the first few hours of owning it, I even contemplated returning it.  So now I'll summarize everything wrong with the G13, warranting a 1-star deduction from this amazing product:<br /><br />1) I know this isn't a keyboard, per se, but nearly every keyboard has pull-out feet that either raise or lower the slope or angle of the keyboard.  I always leave mine in, because I like a flat typing surface.  The G13 has a uni-body construction that has a weird arch in the middle.  Because the palm rest is sloped up, my wrist is always bent.  I find this \\"feature\\" the most uncomfortable thing about the device and have noticed unneeded pressure on my palm from gaming in this position.<br /><br />2) The thumb buttons are too low (for me)to be comfortably reached.  I manage, but since this is sort of a one-size-fits-all device, I could see that if Logitech made the stick/thumb-button area adjustable forward or back, it could make a world of difference.<br /><br />3) The thumb stick button.  I know I said I wouldn't talk about functionality but the top of the stick is not only uncomfortable to rest your thumb on, but as other reviewers have written, the amount of surgical precision combined with brute force required to press this thing is ridiculous.<br /><br />That's about it.  Take note, Logitech.  Implement my changes and slap a \\"G113\\" on the top and you'll have yourself a winner.
B0041KKYCY|2.0|The remake is extremely difficult to watch but it is not because of the simulated rape, torture and final death scenes. It is because you are going to have to suspend belief like crazy to overlook all the plot holes.<br /><br />Firstly, there is the casting of Butler for our protaganist. She doesn't look like a writer, she doesn<br />t act like a writer, she doesn't talk like a writer. Let's face it she is completely unconvincing as a writer. Keaton has the perfect combination of fairly average 'plain Jane' looks and personality with just enough of the shy conservative introspection that writers are known for. The whole point of being a writer is to be able to escape reality and create fantasy on the page. Butler looks more like she works in a gym full-time, is far too extraverted and outgoing in personality and turns up to a completely isolated cabin in the middle of knowhere with enough boxes of booze for her entire stay and not a single book amongst it. Writers never go anywhere without at least one book. They are either writing a book, reading a book or trying to do both simultaneously. At least she could have brought a Chicago Manual of Style with her.<br /><br />If we don't believe Butler is a writer then how the hell are we supposed to believe she is in the middle of nowhere writing a manuscript?<br /><br />The next problem is her claim that she is looking to get away for some peace and quiet. Away from what exactly? In no time at all, she is talking on her cellphone to someone, somewhere about whatever. Not only that, she brings a laptop hooked up to the internet with her in order to write this 'magnificently groundbreaking' manuscript to make Moby Dick read like a fishing story at the local creek and for some bizarre reason she can't finish it where she lives. Ever heard of a library? Are we really expected to believe that there is absolutely no way she could finish this book unless she travels all the way to this archaic cabin in the middle of nowhere? Even if the story is about a protaganist who is actually staying in a completely isolated cabin in the sticks, can't she just imagine it anyway? Or are we to believe that Wells defended the Earth from Martians with bacteria and then simply wrote down what happened verbatim and called it War of The Worlds?<br /><br />The contradiction to this is that when she gets to the cabin she hits writer's block anyway and decides to get smashed on weed and booze.<br /><br />Next, we are expected to believe that she is single. She lies about calling her boyfriend with her broken cellphone in order to hopefully scare off her attackers which is fine and stays consistent with our basic human reaction to a threat or perceived danger anyway. The problem is this is a lie in more ways than one because we know that she is single. No guy is going to wait around for weeks and weeks before he can see her again while she dedicates herself to her career.<br /><br />In the original it is much easier to believe Keaton's version on Hills is single because of the nerdy academic quality she brings to the character. Butler fails completely with her attempt. Her physique looks more like it should be on the cover of Muscle and Fitness rather than a jacket cover of a work of fiction. I didn't believe for one minute as soon as I saw the running scene where she discovers the abandoned toolshed that she sits on her butt for hours each day writing and writing and writing. She also looks like she could easily outrun all five of the beer drinking idiots on their best day. Butler playing the single Hills, simply does not work.<br /><br />The change from four to five antagonists in this remake was a good idea because it allows for some use of leverage on the part of Hills. Nobody could care less about the four morons and whether they are dead or alive but with the Sheriff, there is his pregnant wife and their young daughter. The problem with this is she is now a prime suspect because she was the last one to seehim alive. Hills could easily bury the bodies of the other four, or what's left of them, but there is no way a very pregnant wife of her now dead husband is going to just let the whole thing slide. Hills sends the tape of the crimes that all five men have committed but we never find out whether this is the only copy. If it is a dub then Jennifer must have the original but how did she do this without another tape or the necessary equipment? If it is the original, then his pregnant wife although horrified to find out what her late husband has done, is still a widow because of what Hills has done in retaliation and now has in her possession the only piece of evidence.<br /><br />There is no police report and without the tape there is no evidence that the rapes actually occured except her own testimony against being charged with the murder of five men. If the Sheriff's wife destroys the tape which she probably would, then the outcome is simply that Hills is guilty of a five-way homicide, fraud and kidnapping of the Sheriff's daughter. This is the problem with the final act. The whole thing comes across as surreal. Jennifer even seems to take on a ghostly otherworldly presence where she seems to be able to appear and disappear at will.<br /><br />If we are to believe that the rapes actually did occur then the rest of the movie must be absolutely grounded in reality. As a remake this movie could have been absolutely genius if the whole second and third acts were part of the story that she is trying to write. There could have been some clue at the end that none of it in reality actually happened. She even looks pretty much the same as she did in the beginning. She is simply a brilliant writer who imagined the whole thing and then documented it in such vivid detail that it was like it DID happen.<br /><br />The numerous flaws in this remake are not the actor's fault though. They are simply taking direction from Monroe and trusting his instincts even if something doesn't quite feel right in rehearsals. They all did a fantastic job overall which is why it gets 2 stars. Ultimately though, it is always the director's responsibility for any film. Better luck next time, Steve.

B008MEM24S|5.0|i love it. this game is really addictive. it is really fun to play and is fun for all ages.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|I watched this video because my wife read the book. I had not read the book. The movie was technically wonderful. The acting was quite good and the special effects were stunning. However, I was very disturbed by the premise that teenagers, raised in, generally, good families would kill each other with so much enthusiasm and with no apparent remorse. This feeling stayed with me for days. I am rather older than the average person to whom the books are targeted but this was my emotional reaction to the film. If I had children still at home I think that I would not recommend that they read the book or see the movie. Perhaps this was supposed to allegoric, like \\"Lord of the Flies\\" but it still hit me in a way that \\"Lord of the Flies\\" did not. I'm sorry if this is a negative review but that is my honest feeling about it.
B000FBJAF0|5.0|I love to read a book that I have a difficult time - almost impossible - putting down.  This was such a book - am looking forward to reading \\"The Cobra\\" which I understand is of the same genre.  I have always enjoyed John Forsyth's books.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was a great book, we an awesome story line that kept me hooked the entire time.  The ending was underwhelming to the point of being annoying.  If it ended differently, I may have given it 4 stars.
B004PHSTY8|5.0|The second season is better than the first. The writers and actors are improving. Some episodes move the underlying story forward and others are stand-alone adventures.
034580404X|5.0|i am not a reader and when my mom and her friends kept talking about it i figered i should get it and read it for myself.  i could not put the books down and they are so good i have not only read them once but twice!! i would recommend this book to anyone!!!! such a great story!!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I dont use if often, but when I do I'm thankful to have it. No matter what mood I'm  in I can find something that relaxes me or makes me smiles.<br />I highly recommend this app.
B0085776BG|3.0|The old adage is still true. \\"There are old pilots & bold pilots; but there are no old, bold pilots!\\" Movie plays out fairly accurately. It was worth the price for a rental. Can't see owning it though. It is not \\"made of the right stuff\\" plot wise to endure or become a classic. Would have liked to have seen more of a spin on the difficulties that \\"colored officers & aviators\\" faced just to make it to their unit in the ARMY Air Corp.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I will admit I was hesitant at first to read the book, even though it would show up in my \\"recommended books\\" on multiple websites. I finally gave in and read it, and I can safely say that I am extremely glad that I did and it is officially one of my favorite books. The book is so captivating and the characters and situations just pull you in. The author did a wonderful job at telling Travis and Abby's stories. Abby is your typical good girl and Travis is your typical bad boy. They are worlds apart, yet the author finds a way to tie the two together. Once you start reading, you won't be able to stop. If it hadn't been for the fact that I have a life and things to do, I'd have read the book in less than a day. Buy this book, seriously, you'll LOVE it!!!
B00846TTDG|3.0|Seems to have been a replay of several cinematic efforts offered up in the past. A lot of caps busted, very few magazines recharged & a closing Hi-Speed chase lacking in reality! Glad I didn't spring for two $8 tickets at the cinema!
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Terrible, To Long, Not Enough action, very slow, and just all around time consuming... its like they tried to hard with the movie, when all they had to do, was hit the off button on the camera. id rather watch mickey mouse slaughter goofy then this ever again. Disappointed....
B008XG1X18|5.0|What a great app! Now I don't have note books with all my stuff in it and so easy to use!
B002KEDQJQ|5.0|The plot was excellent with a science fiction hero doing what was necessary to prevent a nuclear war and save mankind from disaster. But the truth and price that was too high for some of the other heroes to stomach. This was science fiction at its best. I wouldn't recommend this for younger or teenage adults because the violence and sex scenes are too graphic.
B0073XORLU|5.0|I really enjoyed this. When I first heard about it I was both surprised and apprehensive. I frankly thought that concept albums were finished--and one that followed on TAAB was impossible. Besides, Martin Barre doesn't play on it. And although I'm a long-time Tull fan, I haven't been impressed with much after Rock Island. The last couple of albums I bought--Catfish Rising and JTull.com just didn't do anything for me.<br /><br />This is different. This is beautiful and I find myself listening it to it a lot usually right after TAAB.<br /><br />I'm hoping Ian will stop in Albuquerque, or someplace I can drive to.
B007TML4EI|5.0|All of the apps like this are the same. Your finger blocks where your finger should be. Someone had to take the time to create these puzzles, game does not suck
B008MEM24S|5.0|My twin grandsons love Perry,  so when they saw it in my App store on my Kindle Fire  they asked ( begged ) if they could get it for me ( Ha Ha ) I said sure, because I have to keep my status as the coolest Granny ever!!! I find myself playing it when they are not at my house, I know I am too old to play this game, but I can't help myself, it's a lot of fun. I love Perry too,  all kidding a side this game makes them think, problem solving that they need to learn, don't give up, you have to get him to the next level, and sometimes it is not so easy, but they keep trying until they figure it out, because they can't let Perry down. The young people in your life will love this Perry game .
B008578H9G|5.0|just when u thought all the killer bees were dead, they left u one last shot. their is one bee that did not die. i love those kinds of movies. house is that killer bee.....
0061251305|5.0|I work with several other business coaches. When it comes to discussing business culture with our clients, this is the \\"go-to\\" book we recommend. It is an engaging read and creates a common language for staff to use in making choices about how they want to change. The stories about companies help clients appreciate that changing a \\"toxic\\" culture is indeed possible, and importantly can significantly impact the financial results of the business in addition.
0553801511|5.0|got the first book from a friend.  Enjoyed it so much that I had to get number two so I could keep reading.  Great book.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Dvd cover is the most important and this one was ok.  Either you are or not. 5 stars for this, maybe 6.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is more than expected.The combination of sounds and the sounds themselves are excellent. Just what the doctor ordered. Very similar to sounds heard when in pain therapy management. Would definitely recommend. Even my significant other loved the sounds.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I'm so glad this app exists. I just wish it didn't take 4 or 5 times to actually get it to open. I keep getting a blank screen and a force close option. But then when it does open it's really easy and fun to use.
B001LJZ3AG|5.0|Some of the best music available wish I could have been at the concert it is great. If you are a Pink<br />floyd fan even if you,re not I suggest getting this great offering by one of the greatest bans of all TIME!
B0025UHKNS|3.0|The product is good, nice GPS signal, great for running.<br />You can easily set up your goals, track your records and compare it off-line or at web.<br /><br />Problem is 14 months later my battery is running out.<br />Last time I used it, battery ran out with only 45 minutes of exercise.
B005Y841QC|4.0|I love this show!! Ive seen every episode :) Sam and Dean are super hot, and the story lines are full of imagination from season to season.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great free app. My daughters got me addicted to this game on their ipod and I had to get in my kindle.
B00448VST6|5.0|I love watching this movie. The soundtrack is amazing as well. I let just about everyone I know borrow this movie so they can experience the glory.
B007NCSQFO|3.0|Okay, I get that Nicki is/wants to be more than just a rapper. I think she is an adequate singer but she is a phenomenal rapper. While I definitely don't want her to not explore her talents, I would just wish she would have played to her strengths a little more. The half hip hop half pop album was not what I was hoping for. I could have used about 2-3 less pop songs and a few more songs of her spazzing out lyrically. All in all it's a solid effort but all I ask of her is if she is not going to us a full rap album is to at least give us a mixtape of her rapping to compliment the hybrid retail album.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This application is great.  It is very good to find out the  level of precipitation in any area of the state(s).
0140143505|5.0|[[ASIN:0140143505 84, Charing Cross Road]]<br />I read previous reviews that said it was quirky and charming so I ordered it - and found those descriptions to be absolutely true. Perfect to take to a doctor or dentist appointment because it's easy to read but has considerable meat on the bone - a marvelous character study of a used book seller in London and a freelance writer in the U.S. just after WWII. She's feisty; he's reserved; and together they make a delightful pair of literate friends. I read it the first time in one evening, again after a friend returned the copy I lent her, and now I'm looking forward to readng it again when a second friend finishes.
B005ZMTAXQ|5.0|My 2 year old loves Woody and Buzz Wightyear (that's how he says it). Of the 3 Toy Stories, this one is my favorite because it doesn't have the sadistic next door neighbor or the heaviness of 'the end'. It continues the story of Buzz and Woody's friendship, introduces great new characters (my current theory is that the little girl who was Jessie's person is also the little girl in Monsters, Inc) and is a joy to watch. Over and over and over as I do with my little guy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Incredibly well-written book. I was quickly drawn in by the alternating voices in each chapter and the gradual revealing of the characters of the husband and wife. I'm a big mystery fan and this was definitely a step above the usual book-- much more of a literary puzzle than a whodunit. Like many of the other reviewers, at first I found the ending unexpectedly abrupt and unsatisfying, but upon reflection, it seemed perfectly in character for both Nick and Amy.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a challenging mystery with interesting psychological twists and turns. \\"Gone Girl\\" is a real page-turner that kept me guessing until the end.
B000KE5JNE|5.0|I have only just discovered these BBC adaptations of British classics.  Like \\"Bleak House\\", the casting and acting in \\"Vanity Fair\\" are SUPERB, and the sets and costuming out of this world.  I envy the first-time viewer!
B005A1ER0I|5.0|For the price, this album was amazing listening. Numbers 11 and 12 are especially epic in my opinion. I wouldn't both getting just a couple of the songs, it's by far better to just get the whole album, the amount of songs you're getting for the price is just awesome. Thomas Bergersen provides quite a variety in this album, so go ahead and GET IT! :D
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it works well and I can check battery so I don't have to have is shut down when I don't know why
B007TML4EI|1.0|I tried launching it three times and still it won't launch.  So it's not worth the time or effort. Time to move on.
0375851569|5.0|I love ordering from Amazon mostly because of the speedy delivery of most of the products I purchase.  The Dr. Seuss book collection was no exception  and continues to prove my happiness with Amazon and their sellers.  My pregnant sister is very excited to start reading these books to her son once he is here in October.
B006CDCWDM|3.0|Raffa's feelings during these matches were interesting to hear but having seen the matches wanted more about family and relationships would have been more what expected. He's a really great athelete and has a wonderful family.
1451626657|4.0|My daughter needed this book for her summer reading that was due by the time school started up. I found these books here and they were very inexpensive so I was happy.
B004LROUNG|4.0|If you like Grisham's books, this is another good read. It hooks you early and keeps your interest while keeping you wondering about how it works out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Captivating and very descriptive story that kept my wife from doing chores all week .If you buy it , you have to buy all 3
034580404X|4.0|I did not get to read these as I have them for a gift. But I will purchase another set for me. It was a nice set.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A book which does take the story of the Hunger Games to a new level, examining the characters in more detail and the impact of a second Hunger Games on the population.  It is rare to find a series of books where the 2nd book delivers as much as the 1st book did.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|After glossing over the interminable and tedious sex, then pages filled with email headers and footers, there really wasn't much of substance left in the, already thin, plotline.  I do believe, though, that if one is to comment on a book, one should read it, so for the sake of being able to join in the general conversation at coffee mornings and girly lunches, I have done my duty and read the trilogy.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The 3rd book of the Hunger Games did not deliver the excitement that book one and book two delivered.  Personally, I think the book ended with a whimper.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A great read overall! Unlike anything I've read before. The book is thoroughly researched and gives new perspective to the events that shapemd America today. Parts of the book can become a bit too long and drawn out but I recommend it!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|works really well on both my thunderbolt and xoom. super fun, great way too kill time. It is fairly simple and repetitive, however Vertu addictive and has husks you much reach to unlock and purchase more things. Very fun.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|Extremely dissapointed with this product. We've only used these headphones on the PC since buying them earlier this year. We have never been able to get them to work on our PS3, even after countless hours of troubleshooting procedures from many different sources, including Turtle Beach. The cords are a huge pain to deal with, frequently get tangled and are always in the way. We finally got so fed up with the PX21 that we went to the local Gamestop, bought a bluetooth ear piece for $35 and never looked back. The bluetooth ear piece has been flawless. I can't believe we paid so much and wasted so much time for such troublesome product like the PX21.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run!when I found out it was on kindle I was ecxsatic. It is a great game, no problems
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I honestly didn't think I was going to  like this book - being a woman/mother and not very interested in the workings of war (yet thankful for those who are!), but there was so much hype around it I decided to give it a shot.  I'm so glad I did.  I could not put it down! It was so interesting and riveting and I now have even more respect for those who choose to put their lives on the line so we can go about our cushy lives.  Thank you so much for writing this book and sharing your experiences with us - I feel like a better person for having read this.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this game is pretty easy to play, different ways to deal came make it much easier to win. this game is good for killing time.
B008IGP8RI|4.0|I am not about to review the movie itself here,  but the soundtrack alone made me want to find out if there was indeed a CD soundtrack available, and I am glad there is.  In a Facebook review I did for the movie, I said the soundtrack was great, \\"and not all was bluegrass, some sounded like modern stuff, from some group out of, say, Texas\\".  So now I learn of Willie Nelson's and Emmylou Harris' involvement(I thought a few songs sounded like her), and furthermore, learned the soundtrack was all written for this movie.  Good sound.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was captivating and annoying right from the beginning.  I love a good mystery, and the writing was decent, so I stuck with it.  I was, however, annoyed that a 38 year old woman was keeping a diary and I found the content within to be like a bad teenage chick flick, and I sort of wanted to punch her in the face more for that than for any of the other horrible things she does throughout the rest of the book.<br /><br />I do have to admit though - for all that, I could not put it down.  I really REALLY wanted to know how it would all end.  And then...<br /><br />The ending was so completely unsavory and unsatisfying that I wish I had stopped reading before the final chapter.  I read in another comment that the author got writer's block at 82% of the way through.  She should have stopped there.  The ending ruined this entire book.  Scratch that, there isn't even an ending to speak of.  She just stopped writing words.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Love it! Nothing can beat it! Parents give Barry five stars! Get it! My favorite thing is flash! Get it!
B009329Y30|4.0|I read the book awhile ago. I was going to see the movie in a theater but was swayed by the picture's reviews. There were things omitted, added, and shortened as you might expect. It was no Academy Award winner I suppose, but I thought that it was a pretty well done story.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a game that my grandson down loaded for me and I found that it was very challenging and interesting I thought it was just for kids but it isnt
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am not artistic, creative or anything else!  However, I am loving Pinterest and it is a great way to share some fun as well as ideas.
0307730697|5.0|Amazing book about an even more amazing guy. I couldn't put the book down. He has an incredible story & left behind quite the legacy for his family. They should be proud.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|In the beginning I was absolutely in love with the book but I kind of started to loose interest towards the end. I still think it's worth the read but I'm not raving about it as much as I was during the first few chapters. He uses some really interesting examples that really make you think. I also enjoyed the very casual tone/style of his writing he really speaks directly to the reader and gets his ideas accorss clearly. It was a quick read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is probably one of the most challenging game I have played in a long time It takes a few times to figure out what to do on some of them but is a great app.using points earned is a nice way to unlock other games when you get stuck.
B006E2VTG2|2.0|The movie is too fake. Most of the plot is so far fetched that it's completely unbelievable. At least some action movies try to be believable. This one doesn't. At the end of the movie I felt I wasted the time watching it! But the action scenes are nicely done.
B007FDE4Y8|3.0|First of all, be aware that the screw on the back that locks the plate down that your camera sits on does not screw into the body of the unit. There is a separate female piece glued into the body and mine pulled out when I hand tightened it. Very poor design for something that is suppose to be holding your expensive equipment. Luckily the camera didn't fall off before I realized what happened. I made it work by removing that piece and placing a nut on the opposite side of the frame as it should have been set up in the first place. I actually drilled and tapped a piece of metal to fit.<br /><br />Besides that fatal flaw, I am liking the shots I'm getting with it now that I have it set up. Just be aware of that defect and don't let it kill your camera. Also, be aware that 47th street photo does not ship this thing timely. Took me almost a month to get my product. I would have expected much more from both Opteka and 47th Street Photo. I only give it three stars because I think the rest of the unit is made well enough and the price was right for my first stabilizer. Hope this helps.
B00006RG9K|4.0|I never ever watch music videos.  However, my husband, son, and I attended one of these concerts from the tour at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wisconsin.  When I realized there would be a video made of the tour, I knew I wanted one.  That was 20 years ago, and I'd forgotten all about it.  I accidentally ran across the DVD while looking at Genesis/Phil Collins' CD's to buy.  I watched the video this weekend and had a great time dancing and singing along in my bedroom.  It brought back memories of the concert and the musicians.  I didn't like the middle section of the first DVD, the section Philip Collins described as \\"old old old from the '70's\\".  Apparently I wasn't familiar with their music at that time.  But the rest of the video was a good time.  I'm going to get my son a copy for Christmas.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love having pinterest right at my fingertips whenever wherever. it freezes up here and there, but an overall wonderful app
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Revolutionized my ability to organize my thoughts over multiple devices.  highly recommend this app to anyone who feels like they constantly forget things.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This book was good but it had a predictable ending. The characters were quirky and their interaction was probably the most interesting part of the book. not a typical law story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really love this app and use it every day, sometimes many times a day! very addictive, easy to search and browse.
1609611543|5.0|Easy reading and understanding. Very informative. If one follows the simple rules you will take the weight off.  Finding the gluten free items is sometimes difficult and when you do items are very expensive.  It works for me in taking weight off but not as fast as some.  I even feel better.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It's the morning of Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are wrapped and routine preparations are well under way. From an outsider's point of view, they have everything required for a 'happly ever after' storybook. They live in a beautiful home, have started a new business, and have been able to care for Nick's ailing parents. Everything appears to be as close to perfect as it can be until Nick's beautiful wife disappears. Where is Amy Dunne? And what, if anything, is Nick's role in her disappearance?<br /><br />\\"Love makes you want to be a better man. But maybe love, real love, also gives you permission to just be the man you are.\\" - Nick Dunne<br /><br />**Mild Spoiler Alert**<br /><br />Gone Girl starts off slow, gains tons of momentum, and then ends horribly. With that said, I didn't hate the book. In fact, I finished a good portion of it in one day.<br /><br />I appreciated the fact that Gillian Flynn was able to keep me guessing and on the edge of my seat. As I read, my opinion of both characters constantly cycled between extremes. Both Nick and Amy both have secrets that are explosive, and the web of lies that they leave behind make it difficult to determine who is truly the victim. Once the plot begins to gain momentum, it's very difficult to put the book down. It's in the end, in my opinion, that Flynn drops the ball and the brilliance ends. She spends a lot of time winding you up for a dramatic and just ending, and then leaves you hanging. When I read the last line of the book, I actually turned the page expecting to read another chapter. I found the acknowledgements instead. I actually re-read the last page, thinking that I must have missed something important. In my opinion, the ending ruins an otherwise brilliantly written book.<br /><br />If you enjoy stories that lack closure, then you will likely appreciate this read. In some ways, Gone Girl reminds me of Defending Jacob. The premises are conceptually similar, but the endings, in my opinion, set them apart. Defending Jacob offered some form of closure while also leaving the rest up for interpretation. Gone Girl, on the other hand, leaves nothing up for interpretation and offers no form of closure whatsoever. You walk away from this novel with the knowledge that what happened to this family will happen again. It's not over and what remains is a ticking time-bomb.<br /><br />\\"My gosh, Nick, why are you so wonderful to me?' He was supposed to say: You deserve it. I love you.<br />But he said,'Because I feel sorry for you.' 'Why?' 'Because every morning you have to wake up and be you.\\"my opinion, set them apart.

B003K16P50|3.0|I bought this on the recommendation of a friend. It is really a sort-of-humorous indictment of the generalized idiocy of government. For me, however, it never really achieved the necessary \\"suspension of disbelief\\". The Kindle edition (which I bought) is generally OK - no serious complaints about formatting etc.
B00881VLCE|4.0|very good puzzle game. I like it a lot. very fun. easy to play. like it a lot.<br />lots of puzzle sizes to choose from is great
B008IJTFYW|5.0|what a life saver this app has been. My husband loves it as much as I do. we go on long trips and this is great for a car ride or to get some rest with .
B00846REIS|4.0|The characters in this novel are so complicated and earthy that I was concerned at first that I wouldn't be able to keep reading.  The attraction and chemistry was awesome.  I love Sylvia Day's writing, it's not just sex (although that is always well written)but I feel like I really know the people in the story.  I'm excited to find out what happens next in the next novel and to find out what his past shows us.  Great read.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very helpful app. I does everything as advertised. I recommend it for any kindle fire User. Installed easily and works immediately.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|As a Nicholas Sparks fan, I thought I'd read everything to date, but somehow missed The Best of Me.  It was a real heart-tug, a little slow starting, but ended up being one of my favorites of his.  I love his pure approach to developing his characters, and by the end I felt as if I knew them personally.  Highly recommend for a good, easy, comfortable read.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This show is amazing!  How did I miss this show when it was on TV?  Too bad they only gave it 3 seasons  :(  Love, Love, Love Veronica Mars.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have used this app every day for months now. It even has the classic alarm that could wake the dead. also you can set the same alarm multiple days or same times different days. never buy a new alarm clock again. or any other alarm app for your kindle.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This is a heads up for Daniel the retired cop who will not buy this because it is a scam...Daniel, this is not in any way associated with THE DARK KNIGHT RISES..this is an animated version of the Frank Miller comic book/graphic novel from 1986 that tells the story of Batman who comes out of retirement when he is 55 because Gotham is under seige by a gang called the Mutants...it is not in any way related to the summer film of this year...because as I have said before; is an animated version of the Nineteen Eighty Six comicbook of the same title....ok? You got it? Good...
B008602KQI|5.0|For any fans of the Hunger Games Book, this movie does a fairly good job of following the book.  It is well done.  I saw it in the theatre and couldn't wait to see it again on DVD.
0307951529|5.0|I didn´t finish the book yet but I´m loving it. So many tips and inofrmations. I´m truly inspired to start my own business.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this is similar to angry birds..but easier..so even my 5 year old enjoyed it!  kept me entertained!<br /> well worth the price!
B008XG1X18|3.0|When I can actually get the app to work, its great.  But, more than half the time, it wont even start or force closes.  All the features are great...but only if I can get to them.  Sad.
0812993292|1.0|Again, I am out of step with the Reading Public.  I found this was a bore and a disappointing read.<br /><br />If it was meant to be \\"quirky\\", I found it cliched.  If it was meant to be philosophical, I found it shallow.  If it was meant to be endearing, I found it dreary and uninspiring.<br /><br />And more than that, I found it poorly written.  It ended abruptly.  Character development was minimal and superficial. The sense of place, which could have been a real feature, was lacking, due to the poor use of descriptive devices.  With a chance to paint a vivid picture, the author used a monotone palate.
B0038P59A0|3.0|I was late to the game watching this film and I'm a Sherlock Holmes devotee. The trailer made this look like a gimmicky action picture similar to Transformers so I hadn't even the slightest interest in seeing it. I can only say my preconceptions were wrong. I really enjoyed the film and think they did a really good job all around.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|This book was poorly written. No new information was revealed. There wasn't even a serious rebuke of the CIC lack of restraint in exposing Unit details. A waste of time!
B003EVWDR0|4.0|I related the Na'vi people as being indigenous people. They live amongst themselves and cherish the natural world as it is without desire to have more material goods. Marine Jake Sully is a paraplegic marine who decides to accept participating in a mission in a distant world called Pandora. Later he finds out that Parker Selfridge, a rich but greedy authoritive figure is going to \\"Na'vi\\" in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland. Jake will get the treatment he needs to restore him to walk again if he agrees to go to Pandora in the avatar disguise to get close enough to gather the precious material in the woodland. Unexpectantly Jake quickly falls in love with a beautiful alien named Neytiri. Jakes will have to fight inorder to aggressively get this material but he now has growth to love this beautiful new world along with Neytiri which causes him to questions his loyalty in order to decide what he should do.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I started this book when I purchased it, shortly after publication. BORING...one dimensional, silly characters who were self- absorbed whiners...every one. Their circumstances were described simplistically, with a banality bordering on the ludicrous. The writing was slow, tedious, speckled with lame quips, and presented people who could do nothing but bitch for unjustifiable reasons. Like, oh damn it all, it's our anniversary. Jeez, there's nothing to do but have a beer this morning, to put off making a dinner reservation. I hate ironing, but I'm doing it for poor hubby, so he'll remember how wonderful I am. Golly, maybe we should have a baby, or maybe not?<br /><br />I stopped reading the book, feeling that no matter what came after the first third of it would be a continuing mind-numbing waste of my time.<br /><br />Seeing this book getting hotter reviews , moving to the top of the best seller lists and staying there was mystifying. So, I tried again. More dull inaction, with a slow peeling away of nasty character flaws that made me even more annoyed that anyone could possibly care about this story.<br /><br />Whammo. If you can get past the first half of the book, you're in for the treat of the year! Brilliant plotting, on-the-edge-of-your-seat psychological suspense, a tensely riveting climax, and a deserved ending will greet you. But, you'll still hate the characters. It's the character(s?) that will come after -- and hopefully, there will not be a sequel -- for whom you will have extraordinary sympathy.
034580404X|5.0|I have been so happy with my purchase of the 50 Shades Trilogy! Once you get started in Book 1, you are hooked and do not want to put it down! I will be keeping this set FOREVER in my personal book collection...........this will not be a trilogy that gets donated or given away! EVER!
B003EYVXXW|5.0|This is an outstanding movie! It really makes you think! As a Deist (a Deist believes in God based on the application of their reason and the laws and designs in Nature and rejects the man-made \\"revealed\\"/hearsay religions like Christianity, Judaism and Islam) it was a moving account of a woman's search for reality and truth via her reason. Hypatia, the real life thoughtful and courageous teacher and philosopher was murdered by the Christians. One of the methods used by the Christian clergy to rile up the Christian mob against her was 1 Timothy 2:11-12 which teaches this ignorant and ungodly teaching: \\"Let the women learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.\\" The clergyman then accused Hypatia of being a witch which really got the faithful angry! We all know what the Bible teaches at Exodus 22:18 - \\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\\" Since the Christian scriptures were clear on what the non-thinking faithful had to do, they killed her.<br /><br />This movie is thought provoking and a great film to help empower girls and women as well as all Deists and freethinkers. It shows us what happens when religions rule and it makes me appreciate even more the American founders who kept religion separate from government.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|Excellent movie and excellent quality, even at \\"standard definition.\\"  I was worried it might not have been clear or the download slow- not the case at all.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how good this novel was.  I was apprehensive at first because of the self published nature of the kindle book, but I purchased it based on the overwhelming number of positive reviews.<br /><br />I have been searching for something that I could really sink my teeth into.  I only recently discovered Brandon Sanderson, and I quickly consumed everything he has written, leaving me with more free time.  I have read many epic series, from George R.R. Martin (May the fat liberal slob rot for writing so slowly and being on the verge of ruining a very promising story) who went the wayside like Robert Jordan, who inevitably bloated their excellent stories beyond recognition.  Same with Terry Goodkind who tried and almost succeeded in blowing up the Sword of truth series.  I can always go back and re-read the greats from Guy Gavriel Kay, Tolkien, Orson Scott Card, Fiest Brooks, Morcock, Anthony, Howard and others.<br /><br />But I wanted something new, and this was a refreshing story from a \\"nobody\\" (yet).  I love his secret to e-publishing success \\"Write a good book.\\"<br /><br />I think you underestimate yourself Mr. Ryan.  In your case the key to self publishing was \\"Write a great book.\\"
B003L77GH4|5.0|I hadn't seen any of the Vampire Diaries on TV. I purchased Season One from Amazon, and I was hooked by the time I finished it. I ordered Season Two before I even finished the previous one so that my viewing wouldn't be interrupted !<br /><br />I believe that I received this on a Friday, and I had watched the whole thing by Sunday night ! I'm not sure that I even showered that weekend !!<br /><br />Without giving anything away, I will say that the characters tremendously evolve in the second season. And the plot contains so many twists and turns that you cannot help but become addicted !<br /><br />I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoyed Season One. Anxiously awaiting Season Three's release on DVD... !
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Product was recieved in a timely manner & has been a great case for my phone. I would recommend this case to anyone who wants to protect their i phone.
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|This movie is based on the best-selling novel of the same title by Jonathran Safran Foer. Whilst no movie can ever contain all that is in a 300+ page novel, the basic facts, and more importantly, the spirit of the novel, were retained despite many changes Hollywood deemed necessary.  I do believe that viewers who have not read the book might be confused by some aspects of the movie (heavy boots, Oskar's insults, codes between characters) and Hollywood has omitted essentially all of the grandmother/grandfather subplot, as well as the effect of what happened in Dresden, Oskar's letters from famous people, upstairs Mr Black and his index cards, the letters from grandfather to son and grandmother to grandson, the digging up of the grave and Oskar's interaction with his psychiatrist (which would have made an excellent scene). Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock were great as Thomas and Linda Schell, but Thomas Horn was absolutely outstanding in his debut acting role as Oskar Schell. The movie was brilliantly directed by Stephen Daldry. Make sure you have the tissues handy: some of the dialogue has been Hollywoodised so it's a real tear-jerker.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I have now read all of Flynn's books in reverse order. While her others I gave 4 and 5 stars, I give this one three. That's not to say it wasn't an interesting read. It definitely was, particularly to see her development as a writer, but while this one contains all the elements that make her other novels great, this one just wasn't quite all there.<br /><br />I have two main problems. First of all (SPOILERS AHEAD), A 13 year old serial killer is stretching it. I understand that the age works well from a plot device standpoint: she is becoming, in development, able to be sweet and evil as only a child of this age could be. However, while you may see signs of serial killing at this age, I don't think there are full blown cases at this age. Or maybe I just don't want to believe that a child so young could be so evil. Secondly, while all of Flynn's characters are deeply damaged if not full on psycho, there is something that about each one that pulls you in. You actually root for them. However, Camille in this book is so damaged and weak that it was hard to care about her. She abuses too many things to be able to continue to function, but she does continue to function.<br /><br />The aspects of Flynn's novels that I love are here in their infant forms. The characters are very well developed. As much as I didn't like a lot of them, they are three dimensional. The characters are the driving force of the novel, and the plot, while mesmerizing, is secondary. This is a study of characters. The odd but evocative descriptions, though not quite as mind-blowing as in the other books, are trying to come out. The only difference that I found here is odd: this book could actually be considered to have a happy ending. The evil characters get what they deserve, although the young killer will be out of jail at the age of 18.<br />flag
B0083EW97W|5.0|Born and Raised isn't for everyone...<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, it doesn't sound like any other John Mayer Album out there. If you want the pop John Mayer I would suggest [[ASIN:B001BKM3MQ Continuum]] or [[ASIN:B001BKAEHW Room For Squares]].<br /><br />This John Mayer is broken, open, laid bare...<br /><br />It is the sound of someone dealing with what it means to grow up in this post modern world. It is a struggle album that needs more than one listen in order to understand what is happening. These songs are deeply personal, rich, and powerful. These songs have lyrics that don't play well in today's all about me world, something I am sure John Mayer has struggled with in spades for the past few years.<br /><br />Songs on this Album will be different every listen, but right now my current favorites are:<br /><br />Shadow Days - This could be describing me from the lyrics. I pray my shadow days are over.<br /><br />If I Ever Get Around to Living - How many of us spend our days searching for a sign?<br /><br />Love is a Verb - A struggle for a deeper meaning of what love can be.
0374275637|5.0|David Brooks of the New York Times has used this book as a reference point in speeches because Kahneman may change our very perception of who we are, and why we do what we do.<br /><br />In clear and accessible language, Kahneman shows how wrong we can be about what we know, and why we are so often mistaken. Kahneman explains how our brain behaves as if it is of two minds: one that thinks fast and is often biased, and one that thinks more slowly and carefull,y but tends to shirk hard tasks. This leads each of us to make false assumptions including what we think we know about our own state of mind.<br /><br />Not since Thomas Kuhn's \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\\" in which the phrase \\"paradigm shift\\" was coined, has such an important book been written about thought and knowledge. This book should be required reading in every freshman college class in the country.<br /><br />Erik Dolson<br />Author of [[ASIN:B00EM30YZ2 Chalice]]
B0009S2T0M|2.0|I bought this thinking it was going to be this great action movie, but I was wrong. The cover says \\"15 years of imprisonment, 5 days of revenge\\" sounds like a action movie right? wrong, its more like a drama/tradgedy, one of those asian films that are sad just for the sake of being sad, their isn't any revenge gotten by the main character, not even a happy ending, just made me depressed. If your looking for an action film THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. I have no idea how such a terrible movie got such good ratings.
B004UBB3KQ|5.0|It seems many are put off by the reference to 'getting a gun' in the song, 'Pumped Up Kicks,' but I'll bet some of these same folks aren't bothered at all by rap music lyrics that talk about physical abuse against women. No matter to me, I want to talk about the album!<br /><br />First off, I think the music is very, very good, especially considering this is the debut offering from this group. The music is interesting and varied, the track order is good, the recording and mixing very good, and Greg Calbi's (Sterling Sound) mastering of the LP is excellent! And if that's not enough, the 180 gram pressing is ruler-flat!! Perhaps the worst thing about the album is the overplaying the controversial song, 'Pumped Up Kicks' has enjoyed since its release. Personally, I can't say a bad thing about this album.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|excellent game, it kept me busy for a very long time, before I knew it I received bonus points for playing for 30 consecutive minutes.... if your hesitant to get it, don't be its worthy of your time!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All I can say is where is book 4!!!! Great series of books.  I can't wait for the movie to come out.. Although I don't think you can get all the great stuff you had in the book in the movie...
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was definitely a page-turner, although I definitely could put it down for some normal \\"life\\" chores.  I love this genre, I loved the idea of a narrative POV of both the husband and wife.  I felt angry at the husband, then angry at the wife.  Then angry at the author.  She didn't know what else to write, so she just quit.  Left me hanging.  So what ended up happening?  I don't know.  I guess I'll never know.
B005KDWUG4|2.0|Music OK. Poor stage presence on a 65 inch screen. Performances not as good as recordings. Michael Buble Caught in the Act - Neil Diamond at Madison Square Garden these make you feel like your right at the concert. Il Divo lacking.
1119963192|5.0|This is a very good book that I would recommend to anyone interested in improving their freestyle stroke (and of course, speed and sense of comfort in the water).  I have learned to swim later on in life, starting with fairly high difficulty around age 29. For those of you who have been there, it started with that feeling of being completely out of breath after a single length and resting a minute before doing the next length...and the continuous feeling/fear of being out of breath. Since then, I have put a lot of effort into becoming a better swimmer -- hard work in the pool, reading various books, and talking to more experienced swimmers about drills, techniques, and swim plans.  But I still have struggled with my comfort level in the water.  For example:  the \\"sinking\\" feeling, always seemingly struggling to take in enough oxygen, and having a very hard time of incorporating flip turns.  Most of the books I have read and people I have talked to aren't quite familiar perhaps on this part of the struggle to become a better swimmer -- from the viewpoint of someone who doesn't yet have an innate sense of comfort in the water.  The SwimSmooth book has been a Godsend when it comes to this part of improving as a swimmer.  The authors seem to be keenly aware and in tune with swimmers of all skill levels and experience...the explanations and drills are very well written and well-illustrated.  For example, I identify with the \\"Arnie\\" swimmer archetype and based on this identification have been able to follow specific drills and techniques to improve my comfort in the water. It's also printed on very high quality, gloss paper - I definitely recommend it for anyone looking to improve their freestyle swimming, from beginner through intermediate skill levels.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this game. very fun and entertaining. hut I wish it had more free puzzles. but otherwise it pretty awesome.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Loved this movie when it first came out. Loved watching it over again at Christmas and even other times. Even more amazed now I can view it in 3D. This is a keeper, to be enjoyed annually, especially in the company of friends and family. The 2D version is great; the 3D version is even better.
B000NQRE1E|2.0|Did they really downgrade this movie from 2.35:1 to 1.85:1 for the Blu Ray?  I have a DVD of this movie that is 2.35:1.  If the Blu Ray is, in fact 1.85:1 I will not be purchasing the Blu Ray and will stick with my DVD!  2.35:1 is the aspect ratio in which this movie was originally released in theaters and that is the only way I will watch this movie, in it's unaltered original format.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book had my eyes glued to the pages.  I want to read it again and again.  It put me on this emotional roller coaster.  After reading this book I wanted to look for more of Suzanne Collins books.  It would be great if she continues from this trilogy.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|the set is the best you can buy. many thing are said about obama being a fool and retarded. It shows obama being a fool bowing to dictators.
0312330863|5.0|[[ASIN:0312330863 All Things Bright and Beautiful]]<br />I just finished it. I hadn't read it in years and wanted to read it again, so back to Amazon to order it. I find myself laughing out loud with some of the antics of James Hariott, and the many animals and people he knew. I have 2 of his books and would like to get the rest. He was a talented writer and as a vet wished I had met him. If you are looking for a delightful book to read order this. If you never read anything by him, order this book.
0345535421|5.0|So far so good, I've read a little over 600 pages, approximately 2/3 of the book.  It is excellent.  I look forward to reading all the books in the 'A Song of Ice and Fire'.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|Mitch Albom has written my favorite book \\"Tuesdays  with Morrie\\" and one of my top 10 favorite books \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\". All of his books are wonderfully written and thought provoking. Thats why when I finished this book. a book that takes after \\"A Christmas Carol\\" I was shocked. Very predictable and in places boring I could hardly finish the story. When the book comes to its conclusion and the three main characters meet its hard to follow and so contrived. I would not reccomend you buy this book. I wish I could get the hours I spent reading it back so I could re-read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" If you havent read that book by all means read it. Here dont bother.
030758836X|3.0|I was sold very early on while reading this books - it is well written and has plenty of plot.  I loved the different twists and turns that that novel took up until the end.<br /><br />I absolutely hated the ending.  I think the author really could have written a better ending - something along the line of Nicks dad not dying and killing Amy at the end - that would have really made a great ending.<br /><br />I really never got why she brought the dad into the book not to have him mixed up in the plot somehow.  Even saying that I hated the ending, I did enjoy the book and I hope they make it into a movie - this would make a good Hollywood thriller on the sceen - and this would be one time they can change the ending in a book and I wouldn't mind....
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is very well thought out, the descriptions are vivid and grasp your attention right off the bat, I was not able to put the book down and I am working on the third one now and cannot seem to put it down either. They are just wonderful.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|excellent game.  I like the variety of short skill games.  prevents getting bord.  wish it was cheaper to unlock new games.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the book after I watched the movie.  The movie left too many unanswered questions.  The book was a quick and entertaining read.  I finished the entire series very quickly and loved it!
B0086700CM|4.0|I love Temple Run. It's a very fun game and I think it's more entertaining than something like Angry Birds. The one thing I would improve is the objectives. There need to be more of them because once you've played for a little while, you achieve the majority of them. The objectives that are left have to do with playing a certain number of games or earning a certain number of points, which just takes time and not necessarily skill.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This puzzle game is calming yet fun and challenging. Really like the soundtrack and graphics. Works fantastically on Kindle Fire! Definitely recommend.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book is very good. Once you start with it you won't be able to stop. The characters are very wel portrayed and the ambiance is wonderful.
B0017HRCQU|5.0|The movie is excellent, of course, but it also has this sound quality in TrueHD, just terrific. The special features are awesome and the little comic and script from The Dark Knight, simply wonderful. The post cards, tremendous. The hologram on the cover is freaking great. I was delighted. The only thing I really missed was that the didn't talk about Hans Zimmer and the soundtrack, which is absolutely magnificent.<br /><br />Totally satisfied. Looking forward for The Dark Knight Rises BR, hopefully limited edition too.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have read many, many SF books in my time.  Perhaps 30 in the last year.  Does this make me an expert?  Hell no.  But since I am not terribly stupid I can pick a winner when I see one.  This is it.  Well crafted, well thought out, complex without being overwhelming, satisfying and rewarding.  Intrigue, betrayal, sacrifice and loyalty are all on display.  Great fight scenes as well as undercurrents of deceit and maneuvering.  It's all here.  Buy this, it's cheap now, until it gets discovered.  I cannot wait for the next volume.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I have really enjoyed this game, it is challenging and easy at the same time. I recommend it to everyone.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app! My addiction.  :) Easy to use. It helps me to keep track of the many projects I want to accomplish.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I purchased this product to use in vehicles that I drive that are equipped with only an FM radio. It has filled the bill beyond all expectations.  It is very compact.  The screen gives all kinds of info.  It is very user friendly.  All you have to do is plug into accessory outlet, tune to an unused FM station and set unit to same and it works.  Would recommend this product to someone who wishes to use as described.  Strong points are portablity, ease of use and outstanding performance.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are awesome.  I couldn't put them down.  I watched the movie after reading the books and I was truly disappointed in it.  I am glad I decided to read the books first.  I never would have read the books after watching the movie.  I thought the movie was awful!  These books are MUST reads!
B008D28HYS|5.0|Like the original CrossMe, CrossMe Color gives hours and hours of play time through a vast number of challenging puzzles.
B008JH5CVS|5.0|Really was. Unrealistic? Sure. But who really gives a crap when the acting is good and the script snappy.  Its not sensitive cinematography, but it is nonetheless more then worth the time and effort to see.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book keeps your interest, going from one of the 3 main characters to another describing tragic situations in Irelands Catholic history.<br />I had tears in my eyes at the end.  I enjoyed learning the lessons taught.
B005LAIHQS|3.0|The pieces are there, and they're moving in the right ways, but this long-awaited revival just doesn't feel right. That's partially due to a crushing lack of Tommy Lee Jones, who's relegated to a mere cameo appearance, but more thoroughly to a lack of conviction and casual, happenstance tone. It's okay for a comedy to be this thoroughly jokey and loose, but the formula that worked for this franchise in the past was a tight balance of those lighter moments with sharp, dramatic action sets. MIB3 may go through those motions, but the emotional punch that its predecessor had delivered so easily is almost completely absent here. Though the vast majority of the film is set in the free love sixties, the atmosphere also remains very modern, like attending a themed costume party where the host didn't get the memo. Excepting a few very easy sight gags and the eyeball-rolling location of the film's grand climax, this just doesn't seem to make much effort to ground itself in that era. Josh Brolin works an uncanny Jones impression during these scenes, but that act falls strangely flat when the real deal himself was on-screen only moments before, and in this case there's really no substitute for the real thing. Quirky and fun, but terribly thin and uncertain... worth watching for the effects and frequent nods to its genre-mates, but it's really no better than the underwhelming Men in Black II.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|not much to say, its simple, and my son loves it! I am a little hooked myself. can't wait for more.
B00003CXXP|3.0|There's a great series of ethical questions just dying to be asked here, but they're buried beneath so many layers of glossy effects, shameless sentimentality and routine overacting, it's hard to say whether they're worth digging up. A.I. is quite Kubrickian at heart - complicated, fascinating and occasionally bizarre just for the sake of it - but also so thoroughly lathered with the strokes of Spielberg that it could almost function as a parody of his career. That duality is often mesmerizing, but also quite destructive. There are a few moments where this picture shines brighter for those combined efforts than it ever could under a single master, particularly in the fleshed-out world itself, but they're frequently outweighed by the long stretches where the two visions clash loudly and horribly - as the entire third act can attest. An aspirant, visually stunning genre-straddler, it's an uneven, long-winded showcase of the best traits and worst indulgences of both directors.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|A nice tablet game. Not too complex, but lots of replay value.  Easy to pick up and play a few minutes at a time.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was great, but I watched it in three sessions and found it tedious to have to go through the setup process for subtitles and then skip to the point where I had paused the movie to pick up the action again.  Maybe it was my player, but I haven't had that issue with other movies.<br />  The extra content was interesting but nothing really special.  Lots of comments on how great all the actors were, what a great job the crew did, etc.  Only Donald Sutherland had anything controversial to say, and that was political--not related to the making of the movie.  It would have been nice to have had an interview with the author to get her take on the finished product.

B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app is very usefully and well made I wish you could do more with it. but I still like it very much it tells you how much battery life you have which is super helpfull and you can even change the Color of the battery. its good that it is free though Bc its not worth buying if it cost anything, atleast the way it id now. :)
034580404X|5.0|Enjoyed reading the series, story line was great would have been just as good with out all the graphic sex details. I fell in love with the characters and wanted to see Grey get his act together and he did, so it made for good reading.  Have recommended to many friends.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have been disappointed with many apps, that claim they can do many applications needed in the office.

B007SGM084|4.0|I do not read many actual books (usually magazines, learning material and things).  If 'you' do not like racey, you won't like it. I loved it (some parts you will hate him, then you love him). I am actually re-redaing :), nice break from reality
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game it is just like the old Pc game only better lots of fun for all ages young and old!!!

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought one of these on a whim to throw in my backpack for trail touch up of numerous blades. This quickly became my go-to sharpener! It weighs next to nothing, it's easy to use and puts an excellent useable edge on any of my knives. Will it make a knife Murray Carter sharp? No, but that's not what it is intended for. This was intended as a light, always-there sharpener for heavy-use blades. I need to buy several more of these for my bug out bag, pants pocket, kitchen knife drawer, car.....you get the picture. Buy a half dozen!
B007TML4EI|5.0|Just like Simple Physics, this app has a simple concept but a high fun factor.<br />It is indeed an extension of Simple Physics.<br />While it doesn't crash, you have to be patient when loading a level - touch once then just wait even if nothing seems to happen - eventually it will.
1592220053|5.0|Awesome, meets all expectations. There are dumb pictures in this copy, which I didn't like, but the stories are great.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Canada is a book which could have been written in half the number of pages. It revolves around an event, a bank robbery, and its consequences. The first half of the book deals with the previous lives of the characters and the preparation of the robbery. I´m talking about 200 pages or more. All the foreshadowings that the narrator uses are not enough to create suspense, and the reader desperately wants the description of the family´s relationship to be over, and get to the robbery itself, which is mentioned from the first page of the book. The second part of the novel is more interesting, characters are richer and the setting is a wild place where anything can happen. Again, the pace is rather morose, but worth reading.<br />So, even if the novel is morose and redundant, and the author manages to create a second part which is much more interesting. Recommend it? No, I don´t think so.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great challenging puzzles. some of them really make. you think. the amount of puzzles is decent. the best ones are the 14x14
B0083GPDBO|5.0|I'm surprised that this film doesn't have higher ratings on Amazon - the critics really loved it (consensus was a rare 85% on RottenTomatoes.com). My husband and I - both avid film buffs - thoroughly enjoyed this creative independent film. What a fresh take on the superhero genre! Loved each of the previously unknown actors and look forward to future work from them. The storytelling was compelling and the plot was not predictable as so many big budget studio films these days are. We gladly followed along at every twist and turn as the story unfolded.<br /><br />My husband and I actually saw this on Valentine's Day because we were desperate to find an entertaining film and pickings are notoriously slim in January and February. We were resolved not to see the latest studio debacle of a rom com aimed at the occasion (the dreadful \\"Valentines Day\\" Really, Hollywood? How creative. How will you ever top yourself next year? :-  ) Chronicle turned out to be a wonderful surprise. Perfect for a date night... and just all-around good filmmaking. Check it out for yourselves and see if you don't agree!
B005FISBV2|5.0|Excellent Blu-Ray set of Dexter Season 6. Great bonus features and commentaries. I'll definitely be ordering Season 7 when it comes out.
B000LVAQDE|5.0|I like this movie, it's an old one but it's very good. I had watched it years ago but it was good to watch it again.
0312323867|3.0|I read first \\"Something borrowed\\" (which I loved) and then immediately bought \\"Something blue\\" not knowing that I was in for a (sweet) disappointment.<br /><br />I was looking forward to see what happens next in the lives of Darcy, Ethan and Rachel. Without spoilers, what happens next is not that exciting...or should I say it's way too exciting to be realistic. There was too much wishful thinking in the story as a whole, too much character change that was not well reasoned and not in compliance with the way the characters were developed in the first book. Furthermore, the end is way too sugar-coated and in my opinion not at all fair to Rachel and to Ethan. In fact, the end of \\"Something blue\\" made lame the many insights on friendship and personal space developed in the first book.<br /><br />That said, the story is nevertheless interesting and sweet and the writing is clever, dynamic and witty but also quite balanced.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I just started playing this on my Fire & love it!  It's not just your ordinary Mahjong game - it contains a fun comic book like story board. Great fun for sure!
B008RJFRTK|2.0|Does not list food, shops, etc. by closest location.  Many close-by are omitted entirely.  I searched for &quot;shopping&quot;, and a store in  Ethiopia over 3,000 miles away was third on the list. Same with other searches. Too buggy. Can't search for specific addresses. The only reason it earned 2 stars is because the offline map feature is a good idea. Stick with the free version.
B008M34CSI|1.0|The movie is boring, and nothing exiting. It was a waste of time.<br />The actors need more acting training. The script is very simple.
B0055N0FZM|5.0|This book is amazing and touches the heart. I would recommend it for anyone. It offers insight on the 2nd world war
B008B3MZNI|5.0|We had to wait a very very long time for this to be released but finally we get to see and own this legendary show.<br />The quality of the video and audio is quite simply stunning for something this old,a few of the long distance shots can be a little grainy, but this is probably due to the limitations of the original source tapes,didn't spoil the show at all for me though i have to say,the producers have really worked miracles and many long hours i'd guess in restoring the footage from the original source tapes.<br />The concert itself is the holy grail for us long suffering supertramp fans, just one dvd of the band(the story so far) to keep us going along with a bootleg or two over many years.<br /><br />Most of supertramps greatest songs are performed fantasticaly well on december 1st 1979 for this dvd,the original paris album was mainly pulled from the 29th november show a few days earlier, so here we actually get to hear a show we've really never heard before, which i thought was a real bonus, obviously it sounds very similar to the origanal cd being from the same paris venue.<br />The whole band are so tight and look to really be enjoying the themselves on stage, shame thats not the case anymore, but never mind all that.<br /><br />I love the close up footage of the members all effortlessly reproducing their music live,they are all multi instrumentalists and the sound they create on stage is unbelievably close to the original recordings, sometimes it sounds even better to my ears.<br /><br />Anyway not much else to say but go and get yourself a copy, go home turn the lights down and let youself be transported back in time to a time when supertramp really were the biggest band in the world,cue the harmonica....
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I loved fifty shades of Grey. You almost fall in love with Christian Grey. Besides the intrigue of Christian Greys passion for crazy sex, I loved the story line. I love the way the author EL James brings the characters to life and virtually every day there is something crazy happening. The author deserves all the fame brought to her for opening a area generally forbidden or thought of as a no go area.
B008BM9L72|1.0|The first book was so bad,I'm not even going to read the rest of the series. The only way to describe it would be Pornography.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect for doing just about anything, Calculator Plus is almost too perfect to be true. The ads don't get in your way,  and, honestly, I didn't notice a single flaw in it's design. I found it extremely helpful.
B00846REIS|1.0|This was pure porn - no story to be found, just occasional narrative to allow the characters to shower and get dressed, or undressed as the case may be. Couldn't finish it.
B002SAS26E|5.0|The game is delivered in small non descript box. But it is a powerhouse in a small package. All the tokens and cardsm fit neatly. A very mobile game because of the compact box. Great components, great fun. This is an easy game to teach to new folks. It is not too complex in terms of strategy, about light strategy, some luck but makes for a smooth, fast game. You basically take good, trade goods or sell goods. As the goods get depleted, they fetch you less rupees for each of these goods. So it is a balance of trying to collect cards, and sell them to get the best rate in terms of money before your opponent grabs it. You can use camel cards to exchange for goods cards. Person with maximum camels gets  a 5 bonus points. Person who gets most rupees (add the camel bonus as rupees  gets the seal of excellence token. The person to get 2 seals of excellences first wins the game. So it is a best of 3. So the game could be over 2-0 or 2-1. So you may play 2 or 3 rounds. This is a great two player game and is a great filer game between some more brain burning games on game night. Light strategy, fast play, easy to pick up and Lots of fun.
0525953728|4.0|This is the real story of what happened on the raid to kill UBL. It is a great read for those people who want to know the true story and not something fabricated out of Washington.I have read alot of negative reviews from so called former \\"operators\\" who have stated a \\"code of silence\\" is their unwritten rule. Navy Seals are awesome warriors who demand our respect but they are also human, and this is really stressed in the book, they make mistakes like we all do. More importantly they are a part of our Armed Forces and almost everything they do needs to be transparent to the taxpayers/ Nation who fund them. Obviously we don't want to put their lives at risk by exposing technology or tactics that  are Classified and NONE of that is in the book. More vital information in regeard to technology /tactics has been leaked to the media by our current administration or seen in recent movies also approved by the current administration. It is great that this young man has the courage to step forward and set the record straight on what really happened on this mission. I am sure many if not all of the one/two star ratings are politically motivated. I am a proud veteran and hope you read this book to appreciate the sacrifices these men and women make and also to see how AWESOME it is when our intelligence community and our military work together as a true Team.
B00846REIS|5.0|It was a very good book very different from 50 shades of grey. Overall very intresting and keeps you reading without putting it down
B0086700CM|4.0|This is app is fun and tests your reflexes. It gets a bit repetitious but fun nonetheless. Sometimes there is a bit of a lag that causes you to die though.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app! I know exactly how I have to read, play games, and watch a video thanks to it! its nice knowing what kind of shape my battery is in too! the only complaint I have is that it automatically pops up as soon as you start charging your device but other than that its awesome!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|My rating is right down the middle, it wasn't my favorite or least favorite book.  The special at the end after the book of Christian's POV was probably the best part.<br /><br />This book takes place right where book 2 leaves off.  This book has lots of glimpsing in time.  There's way less of the kinky stuff in this book.  So if you are looking for that, you wont find it here.  EL James has written mostly a conversational book about Anastasia it includes a lot of action and suspense with Jack Hyde and his revenge.  You see Christian's past as a child as well as learn more about Mrs. Robinson.  There's also an epilogue on Anastasia's life.<br /><br /> It's a perfect ending to the trilogy and you wont be left wondering what happened to Anastasia.
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|Love this movie!Action from beginning to end and reminds me of the 70's Kung fu movies I still enjoy! Never can go wrong with a Tarentino movie, well, more often than not you can't go wrong...lol...
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Any hiker should read this book as it gives you the most revealing story of hiking the Pacific Coast Trail on your own. So well written that you can feel the crunch of the rocks beneath your feet on the trail.  Absolutely loved this book and read it in 4 days - could not put it down!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Well done and surprisingly well cast! I was disappointed seeing such big names as Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson in the trailer, but they turned out to really make the part. And Katniss -- purrrrrfect!<br /><br />Purists may complain that the movie didn't follow the book exactly. But what do you expect? 20 hours of movie? I recommend reading the book so you can fill in the gaps while you're watching. But don't get hung up on the few things that may be different. Just sit back and enjoy. Can't wait to see how book 2 and 3 turn out.
B003B02O14|5.0|This is a great entertaining story about the triumph of the underdog written with all of the suttle muted humor we all love in Grisham's novels.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|This review is about the movie itself. I was very satisfied with the quality of the video and my entire experience with Amazon video.<br /><br />If you have read the book you will be disappointed. If you haven't read the book I'm not sure you will be able to follow the story or understand why the characters behave the way they do.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This little calculator is just what i needed on my kindle fire.  Similar to the Microsoft accessories calculator that comes with windows, this  gives you handy basic functions.  Perfection!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I'm about half way through and this book is as good as the first.  Best part about it is not having to remember all the characters since they are the same as the first.
B000021Y77|5.0|I rarely give a 5 because I believe there are a few really special movies out there that I should save my 5's for. This is one such.  Lola has 20 minutes to run across town and save her boy friend's life, oh yea, she has to come up with $100,00.00 on the way.  She fails, but wait, redo. She starts again, only this time things are a little different, and then again, wow, this was truly fun to watch.  I'm glad I bought the DVD because it's a lot of fun re-watching each run and trying to spot the differences and their effects.  Soundtrack was also great.  Watch people watch.
B008XG1X18|4.0|its awesome and helps out in many ways by helping with ways to dress and new nail designs and step by step to show what to do
B007V2UGPE|2.0|I thought this would be as addictive as angry birds or bebble. Well, of course it's completely different. I just didn't like it much. It was kind of boring.
0345803485|1.0|This book gave me nightmares.  Bondage----really?  American women are ga ga over this book and I just don't understand.  A great step forward for Satan and a greater step back for women.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I haven't had any of the bug problems people have complained of. I'm assuming the issues have been resolved.<br />I love this game. I love having missions and extra achievements to go for.<br />I was originally very disappointed to reach level 15 so quickly, which brought me to the end of my missions. But as soon as I actually finished the final mission, it restarted my missions.<br />I'm on level 43 now, almost through all the missions for the third time. The best part is that although the missions are mostly the same, each time I also encounter original goals each time through.<br />Overall I'd definitely recommend this app.
0525953728|4.0|Having worked in Naval intelligence for 20 years including 2 tours at the National Security Agency, I did not detect any violations of national security. It is simply a great redition of the events in the life of the author leading up that night and the actual killing of Osama Bin Laden.  I highly recommend this book, especially for those who enjoy reading historical events.  Bill.
B0018QBAXG|5.0|Fly Away Home is a great movie!!! It reminds me of myself in so many ways! It's a great family movie, especially if you love animals! Go Igore! ;)
B005SZADQS|5.0|I loved this show, a group of us always talked about it the next day... even days later trying to figure out different plot twists. Cant wait for season 2!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I tend to spend a lot of time on my kindle and this app allows me to be aware if when it needs a break. I've found it extremely helpful and would recommend it to others.
B0085776BG|4.0|Lots of good computer animation action scenes but a little more detail on the history of the squadron should have been included.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It is a well built case to protect my Kindle, I won't worry if I drop it and I love that I can use it and read a book upright.  It's a little heavy but that is part of the protection.  It's exactly what I was looking for.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I saw this in the theater and none of the kids in the entire place moved while this movie was playing.  It was amazing.<br />I bought it and have enjoyed it just as much.  Dr Suess always knew what he was doing.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This app is fantastic!! The graphics are clear and visually interesting. I especially appreciate the simple rules and the subtle increase in difficultly as you progress through the levels. The game allows you to repeat a level until you master it, and also allows players to &quot; purchase &quot; hints using earned points if you simply are stuck. The piano melody that plays throughout is elegant and relaxing. This is the perfect way to unwind and burn off excess &quot;brain energy&quot; at the end of a long day._
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun and very addicting 5 stars I really really did enjoy this wonderful game yippee it is pretty darn cool too
B002U3CCF6|2.0|I did not enjoy this book.  The characters were all too weird for my taste.  I found it rather depressing and predictable. I purchased it because I had recently read the author's latest book \\"Gone Girl\\" which I was really impressed with.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Excellent cast, screenplay, production, and special effects which combine to draw you into the story. A Holmes fan for a very long time, I'd read all of Doyle's novels. And even with the modern special effects, this film remains true to the Holmes legend, including the dark subtext.
1419703692|5.0|This is a beautiful coffee table book with a ton of behind the scenes photography as well as supporting artwork.  Great read for any Batman enthusiast that loved the Dark Night series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book took me for a ride.  Skip the spoilers and just give it a try.  It was a fast read that kept me guessing.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie... even dad loved it and wanted to watch it again. wonderful cast.. Would recommend reading the book also...great read
B00846REIS|4.0|Was a veryy good read. Liked how americanized and how raw this is. Written in todays words. Cant wait to see where book 2&3 go with this story.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|Having read everything else listed before it on the NYT Best Seller List, I went ahead and started this new series, especially since the others I'd been resistant to at first (Twilight Saga, 50 Shades...)  had turned out all right.  Again, though, I guess I was duped into reading another young adult book. It was an okay, easy read, but pretty cheesy altogether.  The Avett Bros. thing was rather annoying and almost an obvious ploy by the author to gain the recognition and favor of the band, and then be able to use that to promote the book. Maybe a genius move, but it did nothing for the book. I didn't even read the lyrics at the top of each chapter. If that's why I wasn't thrilled with it and it lost meaning, then maybe that's my fault.  I think the fact that it was written in a month shows.  Had there been more time spent developing characters and less time writing bad poetry that made my eyes roll (IN-N-OUT Burger, seriously?), it might have been a better book.  However, I'm sure the ease of read and overall topic would work well for a younger audience.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|OK, it's fluff, but it's fun semi-erotic fluff!  Think of it as a 21st century Harlequin romance... (which i haven't read since i was a teenager)
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I was looking for a basic calendar app that I could use to access my Google calender on my Kindle Fire. This fit the bill without being too complicated or too simplistic.
B0088RQ4TI|5.0|GREAT MOVIE , WOULD WATCH IT AGAIN . CAN NOT WAIT TO SEE MORE . VERY LIKEABLE . WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE ?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have used this app for a couple of weeks and it functions as expected.<br />I would recommend it without reservations. Though free it is very useful.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I got hooked on this game because my husband put it on his phone for our son and he loves it. Now I won't let. him play on my Kindle, because I'm too busy playing it myself. I like the fact he's learning basic physics, and doesn't know it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Really enjoy using Evernote!  I even use it for keeping up with my son's milestones. Great to look back at his progress.
B007MS5B6Q|4.0|Walking Dead has been hugely popular in the comic scene for awhile now, yet the introduction of this AMC show skyrocketed the whole franchise into fame and notability among not just the 'nerdy' markets yet the TV market itself. This surge of popularity has given the franchise an amazing amount of room to branch out to video games, novels, collectibles, etc. So the second season of the TV show was bound to have a lavish collectors edition, and while it isn't a letdown, there are some annoying drawbacks.<br /><br />For start, the \\"head-case\\" is pretty cool. It does come from a pretty iconic scene exclusive to the second season of the Walking Dead. The blu-ray discs fit perfectly inside, and the opening/closing mechanism seems pretty solid, yet I keep them with the other blu-ray discs because I see no reason to hide them inside the head. The detail of head seems similar to a high quality Halloween mask up-close, yet looks fantastic from a distance away, and I also love the big title-words underneath the head. Overall, it looks really awesome on a shelf, I have mine on my shelf dedicated to Walking Dead where it holds all my books, issues, and blu-rays of the franchise.<br /><br />The season itself is pretty awesome, I've found that most readers of the book wish it stuck closer to the book and went through these events much faster. (For comparison, the first two season of this show only cover the first twelve issues of the book, and each issue is very short.) Yet I find the second season to be a more dramatic, realistic, and character driven version of the book. There's more time for each character, and more pacing for each event. There's still certainly some issues with the show, most notably two of the characters are jaw-droppingly more stupid in the show, and some other characters are seemingly not in the show.<br /><br />The video and audio quality is terrific. Due to the nature of the show, there's a very gritty look with plenty of film grain, yet it all looks great. There's a general lack of a soundtrack, so there's plenty of time to notice all the immersive background sounds, most notably a very subtle effect of a horde of zombies moaning into a collective disturbing feeling that is used numerous times. While the more intense sounds of gunshots and yelling all stay crisp and clear.<br /><br />This release is spread along four blu-rays, so it's obvious there's a very decent amount of extras here. Yet, the first season had at least one audio commentary on each episode, while this one only has audio commentary on five of the thirteen episodes (and the 20 minute collection of the webisodes). The rest of the special features are pretty awesome, a huge amount of behind the scene and interview featurettes which each clock in around seven minutes. The best part is probably the 30 minutes of deleted scenes.<br /><br />Now while this release is pretty awesome, there is a looming threat of there being another release of the second season in order to get another $40-$50 out of the diehard fans. This was done with the first season, and it could very well be done with this one with the rest of the audio commentaries. Yet even if that does happen, one could still be happy with this release just for the zombie head-case.
B0092MIHSY|4.0|Another very good album from Jens. Unlike his other stellar releases, this one has a consistent tone and mood. Being about a break-up that mood is not exceptionally cheerful (which some people seem to be struggling with) but Jens still finds the humor and little joys.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It took me a little bit to get into the book, but I was distracted by other things at the time.  When I finally got going, I couldn't put the book down.  Great ending, not one that left you unsatisfied.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Although I LOVED the entire trilogy, Darker was my Favorite.  I couldn't put any of the books down, but especially this one.  I really wish James would write more.  GREAT book!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was so overjoyed when I saw that there was a Pinterest app for the Kindle Fire! It works very well with very few mess-ups. The app works much better than the website on the Kindle Fire. Before the app, I pretty much quit Penteresting because the website on the Kindle Fire was very hard to operate. But now I go on it every day. There is only one thing I would like to be changed/improved, the fact that you can not edit your profile and boards. But that is the only flaw I could find. And to those people who say it scrolls too fast; it doesn't scroll fast, you're just spazzing out and moving your finger too fast(:
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins, has captured the truth of government control.  Futurestic and yet current. We must think about our own country<br />as we read and where we are headed.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|I was expecting little from the movie as I had heard very little about it. The characters are also very creepy and the starting fifteen minutes almost had me pausing it multiple times and coming back on a dull weary Sunday. The CG is very good and the story is well thought. Depp as Rango is good and the story line is not very conventionally animation that we have been served. The movie grew on me and I was stuck to my couch after I had passed the initial phase where the story seemed to be going nowhere. The last hour is entertaining and my expectations were exceeded. I would recommend this movie not to the adolescent, but to the young adult and old alike. I can watch this again skipping to the 31st minute or thereabouts.
B000SOZXJG|4.0|The \\"Whale Rider\\"(based of a novel written by Witi Ihimaera) is a well written story with a blend of tradition mixed with modern times.  When growing up in a Maori tribe off the coast of New Zealand, twelve year old Pai, the youngest decendant of the cheif, deals with being a young girl but knowing she has something special to offer her tribe.  But the Maori tribe has never had a female leader, so after the death of her twin brother at birth her grandfather started a school for youngmen in the tribe to find the next chief of the Maori tribe. Koro, Pai's grandfather, refused to think of Pai being the leader of the tribe, to him its a mans job and its tradition.  In small tribes and cultures tradition is imperative, and breaking traditions in a culture is not thought of as normal. So though you'll not like what Koro does at times, it's understandable to see him not want to change in their traditions. \\"Whale Rider\\" shows that with modern times and globaliztion of modern cultures, change in traditions is not at all a bad thing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is definitely one of the best books I've ever read. From start to finish, I didn't want to put it down. The author writes in a very honest and realistic manner that is rare. You get a real feel for how these superbly elite operators think. I've read other books by SEALs and many of them just can't translate their experiences and thoughts into written form very well. They'll fall back on cliche, or how they think they should write rather than giving it straight. This book is different. It takes you inside the life of a DEVGRU operator and is detailed and engagingly written. The author was one of the most experienced operators in DEVGRU and he tells many outstanding accounts of his training and missions.
B007FSF1FE|5.0|After seeing Dr. John live at the Flood City Music Festival I new I had to have one of his albums. This one, being the most recent, seemed an obvious choice. Once I realized it was produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys it was a cinch. This is a great album that highlights Dr. John's ability and Auerbach's ingenuity. A quality listen over and over. Highly recommend!
B0088WIQBM|2.0|The show had a lot of the right actors but suffers from a lot of whining and there isn't much adventure.  This show had the right combination for huge potential but fell short due to script writing.
145162445X|5.0|The book was amazing! Quantum mechanics, String theory, and unimaginable distances discussed in an understandable manner which was a pleasure to read,and, it made sense! I have not kept up with the field and this was an enlightening journey into the most current trends explaining the \\"universe\\"!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The book was good but dragged in spots and was also a little predictable.  It left me feeling very depressed.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|great game nothing bad to say. the arenas are awesome and the co op is great tons of lvls and maps and abilities. if only there wasn't fairies
B0091LRZZW|5.0|I saw the abbreviated version of LIVE KISSES on PBS. I hadn't expected to enjoy it as I didn't care much for KISSES ON THE BOTTOM, thinking Paul's voice was weak and any real energy lacking.<br /><br />Much to my surprise and delight, LIVE KISSES is a highly enjoyable experience. Paul's voice sounds a lot stronger in these sessions, and he's clearly enjoying himself, as are the band. Their performance is also much more energetic and loose. I thought the bass player, John Clayton, excelled in particular.<br /><br />The interviews between songs were interesting and delved into the history of Capitol Studios, as well as Paul's love for the material. It really came through in his performance. I'm certain the unedited version on DVD will be even better. The bonus material--the videos of \\"My Valentine\\" and the interview about the making of the album--are icing on the cake.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all McCartney fans, as well as lovers of standards.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Better than the first...at least slightly more believable.  Not as impressed with the series as led to believe.  Overall so-so
B0066W1AZK|4.0|best chess program I found. it even has a difficulty slider bar for the AI starting at easy and going up to impossible.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|thanks for making an easy to play and hard to master game that has all the elements of an instant classic! you guys are great!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can find anything!  From decorating, to DIY's to recipes.  It's perfect for all my creative needs.  The only problem can be that sometimes Pins aren't linked to websites anymore.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Does a decent job at recreating the book<br />the extra features/behind-the-scenes give a really good insight into the effort put into the movie
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|This package includes both the BluRay and regular DVD - I have not had time to go into any of the special features of the BluRay so I can't comment on them - the digital copy that is included (password is included and you must go to a secure download site to download your copy) is only good to 12/31/12.<br /><br />As to the theatrical value of the movie, tastes vary but it followed along the lines of the TV series (Firefly) so if you enjoy that you will probably enjoy the movie - I enjoyed both. I'll probably watch again and have the digital copy on my tablet in case I'm on a trip and need a good diversion.
B0028INIWE|4.0|This collection has a good sampling of the Grateful Dead's best songs but you won't find everything. That list is just too long.<br /><br />The most noticeable feature to me is that several of the songs sound digitally enhanced. While they sound very good it is a noticeable difference from the originals.<br /><br />This is a good collection for those looking for a sample of the Grateful Dead's work or trying to have a complete collection.

B008KOMMTA|5.0|Having worked as a core extra in this movie back in 96-97 in Baja Fox Studios, Rosarito Beach, BCN, Mexico, where this movie was shot, I have always looked out for any additional footage that is not included in the movie.<br /><br />We spent about 6 months working a typical 12-16 hours a day, 6 days a week, shooting this movie, so with 2.5 hours of additional material and never seen footage, we get to see stuff we only remember now, as a fading memory of this amazing project.<br /><br />This box set has nothing NEW per se, the last 'Special edition' that came out in 2005-2006 had a disc with a lot of extra material in it.<br /><br />The appeal of this special edition, is that only about 2000 were made in total, 1000 sold in the UK, and that the movie is now in 3D, which really brings it alive, I could feel being on the set once again, walking the promenade deck, the dining room, the cigar room.<br />I do not miss the ice cold water of the Pacific in winter, which was used to fill tank 1 of the main stage, where the ship was erected.
0525478817|5.0|In a strange way, I always sort of dread reading anything by John Green. Weird, right? See, I live in perpetual fear that one day he will let me down and his book will be less brilliant than I'm expecting. My expectations when it comes to John Green are ridiculously high, because, basically, he's like the god of the nerds and, even in the books I like less, his writing makes me laugh and makes me feel. Despite this constant fear, his books have, so far, improved every time, with The Fault in Our Stars being his best yet, dark and funny and honest and touching and hopeful and depressing and painful and perfect.<br /><br />*wipes away tears*<br /><br />When people talk about this book, the first thing they mention is the sadness of it, of how many tissues are requisite to getting through this novel without emerging a snot monster at the end. What struck me much more strongly, though, was the sense of humor and optimism running through the book, even the darkest moments. The humor doesn't subtract from the pain or the suffering; it humanizes it, and enhances the strength of the characters.<br /><br />In the past, my main complaint about John Green's books (no, I did not think they were all completely perfect) were the characters. They were real, but they were annoying and repetitive (especially with Paper Towns and Looking for Alaska. None of them did I fall completely in love with, although Tiny Cooper was close. In Hazel and Augusta, John Green's characterization has seriously hit its stride in my opinion.<br /><br />Hazel's voice is just...incredible. Her sarcasm, her brutal honesty, her anger, her intelligence and her wit all made her one of the most wonderful narrators I've ever encountered. I love the way she phrases things. I love that she uses some words that I don't know the meaning of, which really doesn't happen often in my reading. Hazel feels wholly like a kindred spirit, like we would be friends if we ever met, which would totally never happen since we're both so anti-social. Also, she feels one hundred percent like a female to me, always a remarkable thing for a male author to accomplish.<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus meet and there's an immediate attraction. Though they immediately feel for one another on some level, John Green deftly doesn't go anywhere near instalove territory. For one thing, there's Hazel's cancer, which holds the two apart. Even if there weren't and they immediately leaped into a relationship, I would have been okay with it, because the two legitimately develop a bond. They wisecrack and have this insane rapport; they share a love of word play and navel gazing. They trade their favorite novels and both go into the experience with an open mind, even though the novels were not what they were expecting. They are, without a doubt, one of the best, most convincing, most well-matched couples I have encountered in fiction.<br /><br />Throughout The Fault in Our Stars, John Green has woven a lot of thoughts about the value of fiction and about what a novel really is, both to the reader and to the author. Hazel's favorite novel, An Imperial Affliction by Peter Van Houten, is a work of literary fiction about a young girl with cancer; Augustus' is a series of novelizations based on a video game about the adventures of Staff Sergeant Max Mayhem. While there's clearly a difference of literary merit between the two, I loved how John Green stressed the importance of both.<br /><br />I feel like there isn't much more that I can say about this without cutting into your enjoyment of the book. I realize I didn't talk about the cancer at all, but I suppose that was intentional, because the book isn't so much about the cancer as about the people who are partially made of cancer. The cancer is them after all, not a foreign element. The book is wholly about cancer and wholly not, though I know that probably doesn't make any sense. What I mean is that this is in no way simply some weepy tearjerker stereotype of a cancer book.<br /><br />My words are failing me, so I leave you now with this: The Fault in Our Stars is everything I dreamed it would be and more. John Green constantly increases his awesomeness. With this novel, he will break your heart, repair said heart a few sizes larger, make you laugh, give you hope, rip your heart to pieces again, and basically tell you the utter truth about a lot of awful things also known as life.cer book.<br /><br />My words are failing me, so I leave you now with this: The Fault in Our Stars is everything I dreamed it would be and more.

B000066744|5.0|I saw \\"The Legend of 1900\\" on TV and later bought the video. I love classics and piano. Not only is this movie<br />extremely entertaining (musically) the story is gripping. I won't bore you with the story line, a hundred others<br />have already done that... however, I will say that this movie is so refreshing, so different and very very touching that<br />you can hardly walk away without thinking about it for days!  Yes, I actually wondered if something this bizzard<br />and yet beautiful could ever happen to someone? Tim Roth is perfect in this part and the movie never lets you be<br />bored. If there is a top ten for unusually unique films with a great story this has to be in the top ten! You will<br />not waste your time seeing this movie. Everyone I recommended this film to has thanked me... enjoy
B0083IQFD2|4.0|I've been hooked on Azealia Banks since late last year, when \\"212\\" topped every music blogger's short list of artists to watch. That track, along with the other three featured on this EP (the title track in particular) offer a strong introduction to an emerging young artist who, with time and practice, will surely grow to define her artistic identity apart from the seemingly inevitable comparisons nearly all new artists are challenged to rise above. Fortunately for Banks, she already has a lot going for her. Her rhymes are witty, full of dirty talk and rapid fire free association and her ever fierce delivery backs up every word. Her musical sensibilities are quirky, yet ultimately accessible and above all, engaging. To top it off, her style is as refreshingly real as her songs. I recommend checking out this EP along with her recent mixtape Fantasea, which offers an in depth view of Banks' abilities and aesthetic, albeit considerably less commercial in its breadth than this all too brief collection of singles. Taken together, the two releases, along with the impeccable new video for \\"1991\\", are just enough to tide over fans hungry for her long awaited LP Broke with Expensive Taste, expected to drop in early 2013.

1844257797|5.0|I've had many Haynes manuals over the years and it's the first think I look for after getting a new vehicle. This one is one of the best yet - it has some colour and a hard cover for starters. There is a brief history of the Olihead engine development and the various model types, extended sections on tools, safety checks (geared towards the MOT in the UK, but still useful), and a glossary of technical terms. Also new is the level of difficulty rating (out of five spanners) to guide readers on the challenge involved in each job. The manual covers a wide range of bikes having the common engine. This is fine concerning the engine, but when it comes to electrics, body panels etc, where each model is different, they have to skim over detail. Readers will also have to be careful to double and triple check specifications to ensure they've picked the correct ones from all of the models listed. Some of the info is generic to motorbikes - such as how to do chain maintenance - not relevant on a shaft drive bike! All considered, another excellent manual.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I'm more of a hard core science fiction than fantasy fan but the reviews were so good and price so low that I decided to give this book a go.  What a find!  This is an amazingly well structured and written story.  I almost never read anything twice but this story was weaved so well that I found myself wanting to go through it again just to pick up all the threads I missed in only one pass.  Whatever your favorite genre, don't miss this one.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|Very bad movie, too slow, kinda butchers the whole snow white classic, and is way too expensive for what it's worth.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Let's be honest, I never really was into zombie movies and the like. Except for the occasional 'high profile' films that would come out(like Romero's 'Living Dead' series, 28 Days/Weeks  Later, Zombieland), I'd stay away from them. I always figured that if you seen one, you seen 'em all. Then, when I saw this show, all that changed. I caught the fever and can't seem to get enough of them. I'm sure you can tell by my reviews, I have to get my daily 'zombie' fix or else. I'm addicted, what can I say?<br /><br />The second season opens with Rick and his group of survivors leaving Atlanta.  They come to the decision that Fort Benning will be their next destination. Along the way, they come across a traffic jam of abandoned vehicles on I-85. The group loots several vehicles. When a large horde of walkers approach, they're forced to hide under the vehicles. Sophia is chased away from the camp by two of the remaining walkers and she runs off into the woods. Carl is accidentally shot during the initial search for her. Otis, the man who accidently shot Carl, leads Rick and Shane to a large, isolated farm owned by a veterinarian named Hershel Greene. And that, folks, is basically where it all begins.<br /><br />You're going to be surprised because alot of things happen this season that you might not have expected to happen..especially with the season finale, which was viewed by a record-breaking 9.0 million viewers, making it the highest rated episode of the series, and the most viewed episode of an original series on AMC, in history.<br /><br />The thing I love most about the show is how Rick and the group deal with having to fight to live in this terrifying new world. Not only that but how they are changed by the overwhelming realization that those who survive can be far more dangerous than the mindless zombies that roam the earth. Most of the things they do mirror what we would do in a given situation such as that.<br /><br />If I had any gripes, it would be that there are several characters who stories I would like to see(Daryl, T-Dog and Sophia's Mom, for example). For the moment, at least, their stories hadn't been told and I know that they'd have good stories to tell.<br /><br />At any rate, the second season is great and even better than the first. I can't wait til the complete third season is released on DVD. Lol, course- that will be awhile as it hasn't even begun yet. If you're just now hearing about AMC's The Walking Dead, I suggest you get seasons one and two and catch up on the storyline. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. If my wife will get into a show like this when she normally dislikes watching stuff like this, you know there must be something there that drives her to watch(and it's clear it's not to see the zombies chow down, lol). It's a great show. Intense, exciting, & compelling. The Walking Dead rules!<br /><br />blackaciddevilseveral characters who stories I would like to see(Daryl, T-Dog and Sophia's Mom, for example).

B000SEJHRA|2.0|I have read a few of David Sedaris' other books and thought they were simply hysterical.  However, \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is not like those other books.  Although some lines were worthy of a small smile, I thought the book failed to entertain.  Overall, I was disappointed with the purchase.  Next time, I will just borrow the book from a friend before I waste more of my money.

B007TML4EI|5.0|I downloaded this app today, during Amazon's free app of the day sale.  It installed easily and quickly, and it runs seamlessly on my Creative ZiiO 10.  The game is easy to figure out with good instructions and a tutorial to start you off.  It's creative and fun trying to save Melvin, the dummy.  After getting through the first few challenges, I was hooked.  The graphics are really sharp and detailed.  And, the physics seems to be quite accurate.  You can quickly try your design and then adjust and try again, if it failed the first time.  Once you save him from the threat, it's on to another threat and the need to design again.  Overall, I can see playing this game for a long time.  Great app.  Enjoy!
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Flowers for Algernon is beautifully written, highly emotional and a thought provoking novel. The book starts with reading Charlie's thoughts, written when his IQ is 68. He was chosen for a controversial surgery, and we get to experience his growing intelligence (IQ is 185) through his progress reports. We also get to see how people treat Charlie at all stages of his intelligence and vice versa. Algernon is the little white mouse that the experimental surgery was done on first.<br />A remarkable timeless novel originally written in 1959.<br />Highly recommended!
B005K01VZS|5.0|I laughed, I cried and absolutely LOVED this story. For people of all faiths. Would definitely recommend this one to a friend!!
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|Yep, not a bad book. I think it gives a good insight into relationships, and one dimension of how they work effectively, it is just that life is perhaps a bit more complicated than this.
B003GK22HA|5.0|A friend of mine at work absolutely insisted that I read this book and I am so glad that they did! This was one of the best epic novels I have ever read!<br /><br />I loved the main character of Taita. I've read some of the reviews mocking the fact that he was almost perfect at everything - well so what?! This is a story of time close to the beginning of civilization and literally the invention of the wheel!<br /><br />There are also reviewers out there complaining about how bad the historical references were. Well, there is an entire section for non-fiction books. This is a novel of fiction. And it was great.<br /><br />Bottom line, this book made me laugh, almost cry, gasp in horror, and hold my breath with anticipation. It was a really great book to read.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|After flying through Gone Girl, I wanted to read more Gillian Flynn. While Sharp Objects was written several years prior, it contained similar elements of tension, suspense and complicated interpersonal relationships that made her more recent novel so enjoyable. This was an equally good read; there was one thread I thought was left hanging, otherwise I'd have given it 5 stars.
0345803485|2.0|I'm a man in my mid-twenties. I studied Economics and Mathematics in college, but I've always had a keen interest in porn, and what the experience of watching sexually explicit media reveals about us. A few of my acquaintances recommended 'Fifty Shades of Grey' to me, so I decided to read it. In my life, I have dedicated a significant portion of the little attention I can muster to porn, and I always wondered about the possibility of porn as mainstream media content. 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is a mega-hit bestseller novel, and it was introduced by mainstream news media quite frequently, so I was curious whether this novel could show me the form of porn that I have been wondering about.<br /><br />After the first reading, I'm very thoroughly disappointed. It is not the fact that the hero is pretty much Clark Kent and Wonder Woman's lovechild that inherited Tony Stark's money that bothers me. My main issue is that the sex scenes are incredibly boring. There is no persuasive enough narrative that tells the reader why that woman orgasms every 2 seconds, yet they keep coming. When we encounter porn, we do not seek for realistic plots or characters, but we do seek for realistic orgasms, and blandly telling the reader that 'she had an exhausting orgasm' simply is not enough to persuade him that she in fact had an 'exhausting' orgasm. Porn loses everything when its descriptions of sexual sensation lose their persuasiveness. Once that happens the screams lose their human aspect, and become long and torturous screams of deception that force your brains to start working again and come up with another search keyword. A painful experience.<br /><br />Its character development is excruciatingly lacking, and its narrative falls short of any standard. This book fails to make a true connection with the reader. It fails to be what a story should be, which is a medium that connects the reader to an experience or an understanding. I am forced to be puzzled by those that profess to have experienced arousal or vivid sexual tension through this book, as in my mind this book is incapable of mediating any sort of such experience.<br /><br />It is not porn. If it is, it is bad porn. It is closer to something I would see in fan fictions written by 12 year old kids. Nevertheless it is labeled as porn, and I find that insulting to the long tradition of porn that so many people have cherished. Granted, this is my first read, but I expect that if there ever is a second reading I'll come back with a longer review of more disappointment.
B0090EIC3Y|3.0|The new movie with Sacha Baron Cohen is entertaining, however if you are a Borat fan you will probably be somewhat dissappointed.  The movie has it's moments though, and I would watch it a second time.  I would have rather seen a sequel to Borat.
B000WS4QJG|2.0|Short review: The original album content is great. Michael Jackson was such an immensely talented artist.<br /><br />But the additional content is terrible. I can't imagine any other credible artist of Jackson's stature adding additional content such as this (if at all). Imagine the Beatles including 6 extra crappy rap remixes of &#34;Sgt. Pepper&#34; on the original album. Or a re-release of Led Zeppelin IV including 5 extra cheese-ball tracks of beat box re-treads of &#34;Stairway to Heaven&#34; or &#34;When the Levee Breaks&#34;.<br /><br />Fail.

B0047WJ11G|4.0|With all those special effects, it's difficult to rate the acting ... but who cares??  With all that CGI and special effects, you don't need acting in an action-adventure film, right?  As it turns out, the scripting, and acting, are good enough to make this a fairly fast-moving movie which will satisfy just about everybody.  I have to admit that I found this movie entertaining, engrossing, and surprising enough to qualify for a good rating and advice to watch it (if you haven't seen it), and I'll tell you that you would not regret it.  To me as long as a movie takes me out of the 'everyday' world, keeps me guessing, and entertains me - that's as much as any of them can (or should) do!  :)<br />  My only problem with Amazon movies (all of them), is that my HD TV seems to not be able to allow me to hear those low-dialogue moments which some films have a lot of ... this one left me wondering what some actors said, and hoping the movie wouldn't have too many scenes like that ... it was okay, but I wish that Amazon had the audio quality of Netflix ... especially for \\"Hi-definition\\" quality films; I have no problem hearing whispers on Netflix movies on my TV, so why do the Amazon movies seem to drop the audio?  I have no idea, but I refuse to give five-stars to any Amazon film until the audio quality is enhanced!

B000003NA3|5.0|I agree with most of the reviews that these recordings are essential. It is very interesting to hear coltrane and dolphy go at it as if they were sparring with each other, as well as elvin jones smashing on the drums or roy haynes, it is obvious who is playing due to everyones unique style.<br />  Coltrane and dolphy each take what seems like completely different approaches to their horns with dolphy utilizing the altissmo register masterfully on the alto sax and his signature bass clarinet sound.<br /> These recording are for the listerner that completely understands the idea of music as a stream of consciouness or paint that is constantly being thrown on a sound canvass.<br />I find it almost addictive listening to all of the versions of impressions back to back. The different versions of india ans spiritual are now a morning mantra for myself moreso than the trendy a love supreme as mantra approach.<br /> The disc 4 version od spiritual is completely mindblowing and i disagree with the comments about the contrabasson \\"almost ruining' the track.You can only really hear it at the beginnigand i dont blame them for not knowing how to mic that kind of instrument anyways.<br /> The 2 versions of naima are a great addition to version junkies like myself that love as many diff versions of songs as possible. (It is great to listen to the european tour 63 versions then these 61 versions as well as the village vanguard 1966 version back to back)..<br />These recordings are absolutely essential for not only coltrane fans but anyone who is into instrumental music that does not follow any specific rules, just great canvasses of sound. Another standout is this early version of brazillia that is drastically different from what would later appear as track 2 on \\"john coltrane quartett plays\\" from 1965..<br />It is a shame that the entire box set what not available for a long time and the public was left witht the 3 song version that i had owned prior to purchasing it.<br /> I do agree with the version of 'chasin the trane\\" that was originally included in the 3 song version is probably still the most mind blowing track of those 4 nights there are many points during the recordings,(ESPECIALLY DURING CHASIN THE TRANE AND THE DISC 4 INDIA AND SPIRITUAL),that seem like coltrane is channeling energy and ideas that are coming from another realm of reality.

B008602KQI|4.0|Normally movie adaptations from books leaves one wanting or needing more. While the first movie version of the famous book series does not tell us the whole story, it still gives us the characters we can identify with and sets the table for the sequels sure to follow. The world has survived a horrible war event, that was a conflict between classes with the lower class coming up short. The upper class will make sure the the districts remaining will always remember who won, inaugurating the annual \\"Hunger Games\\" where the losing districts send two children, ages 12 to 18, one male one female, to compete in a contest to the death, while the world watches. The Games are used to remind those who lost the war, never to use conflict as a solution to their problems, and the 12 districts lost their war to the Capitol and it's followers. The brutal Hunger Games tells a remarkable story, but the movie does not do the story real justice, keeping viewers safe from the tragedy of the the story most likely to keep its pg13 rating. Still, the movie is entertaining and involving and it's 2 plus hours is worth viewing.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I bought this ap a few months ago, or close to it. I was a  sceptic, but I have to say this ap has made a major positive impact in both my life and my husband's.  It has made getting to sleep and staying asleep so much easier and the quality of our sleep has improved dramatically.  I am nocturnal by nature, but have been able to sleep at night since using this. I have less nightmares now too, though I'm not sure if it is from this or not. It's a dramatic difference though.<br /><br />I only use the availability of mixing my own combinations of the sounds provided. I like that I can adjust the volume of each individual sound.<br /><br />The only negative is I have to go into the menu and force stop the ap to keep it from running in the background after closing out on my Kindle Fire.  That's a very small inconvenience considering the improved quality of sleep.  It works while offline so that is how I use it.  I don't tend to purchase apps that cost actual dollars, but this one was well worth it.

B0047WJ12K|5.0|The Product was delivered 1 day before the arrival date. that was a plus. When i got the pop in the Bluray disk, it was simply awesome to say the colors and the Definition on the caracters in the movie. Im obsessed with blu ray and 3D movies. Keep on buying from Amazon. Great deals!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Was so engrossed in this ebook that I literally couldn't put it down, ask my family :)  I really enjoyed it and had been hoping to grab it at the library but gave that up when it was constantly out on loan!<br /><br />Having read the other two books by Mr. Larrson, I anticipated that this one was going to be a winner.  And this time the  Swedish names and places were hardly an issue for me as they were in the first book.  It is without a doubt a great read, filled with suspense, twists and turns, and well-thought-out and intelligent prose.  I will really miss his style!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this is so great I love the dream and the meditation noises I aloe like the night and camp fire.
B00881VLCE|3.0|its fun to use the app. but its always freezing up. have to close it out and restart...or resume. gets a little frustrating.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is by far one of the best apps I have downloaded.  I wish there was one like thus for my laptop.
0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob was as intriguing  as everyone who read it told me it would be. The chacters were well developed as the book went along. The author kept me asking myself...\\"Who did it?\\". Willian Landay explained many points of law that I was not aware of, and that helped me to understand the novel as I read. After I read the last chapter, I said, \\"Wow\\"! Great!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|App works great, haven't had any probelms logging inorganic otherwise like the other reviewers. only wish I could tag people when leaving comments.
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book! The twists and turns and the sick mind games by a masterful manipulator and actor keep you glued to this novel. Interesting comments on how we are all acting sometimes in our lives; especially the roles we play while in the mating dance. Couldn't help cheer at some of the angry diatribes of the antagonsist; a bit extreme but oh, so satisfying!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it and use it daily. It makes everything easier to get to. But it freezes on me a lot.

0061122416|3.0|While overall a good book with provocative and very relevant life lessons these lessons become lost in an unrealistic and erratic plot. The book is very clear in its morals but this story of a mere shepherd who left everything in search of treasure becomes a bit of a stretch and loses it's excitement and the readers interest as it nears the climax.<br />  Paulo Coelho is very clear in the point he is trying to make about life and the way it should be lived. The Old King the boy meet tells him that we should all try to achieve what will make us truly happy and not what will please others. The message about not fearing the consequences and trying to live your life to the fullest rings very true in our daily lives. As opposed to other books this book is less about helping and treating other fairly and more about fulfilling your own personal legend. The boys time in the desert with a mystical alchemist is a time in the book filled with great quotes and powerful views on lives and how we feel about accomplishing our dreams. We are told it is better to attempt something and fail than to not make an attempt and go on living life fearing failure. This idea and others define Coelho's thoughts toward life and the lessons he seems to have learned firsthand. His writing style is very compatible with sending messages, it is straightforward and blunt. Nothing is left up to guesswork . If he is trying to get a point or a idea across it is very clear. The life lessons are delivered clearly and very often which leads to a very moving and thought provoking book.<br />  However, as valuable as it is to take the ideas seriously and try to apply them to our lives, the sincerity and power of the teachings are lost with the massive amounts of repetition throughout the book. Coupled with a plot that seems tailored to teach and not to tell an deep or intriguing story these morals can become somewhat lost and hard to relate to.  Throughout the book the boy meets several shallow and underdeveloped characters for short amounts of time. They all seem to repeat the same message in different or similar forms. From the King to the Englishman to the Alchemist they all tell the boy to not be afraid to fulfill his dreams and that the Soul of the World will help him along. All of the characters are not even given proper names and fly in and out of the story before we can learn a little more about them. They are all envelopes for the same letter and repeat themselves multiple times. Only one character seems to have been excluded from this mold and that would be the crystal merchant. The boy learns many lessons from the merchant without them being hurled at both him and the reader. It takes a while but eventually we do learn a little bit about the glass merchant and his thoughts and his past. The glass merchant is an example of one who is afraid to pursue his dreams and is somewhat a contrasting personality from the boy. It is a nice break to indirectly learn a lesson and have some freedom to interpret it the way you would like, not how the author thinks it should be viewed. The plot does become unrealistic as the book goes on, the boy gains seemingly magical powers and is forced to turn himself into the wind. The lessons taught in these times seem hard to relate to. The plot seems geared towards only morals and not towards telling an engrossing and exciting story. This caused me some boredom but the core of the plot was enjoyable.<br /> Overall it is good to listen to this book and what it has to say but not look past that too much. Don't expect an enthralling tale that will have you reading for hours.
0156012197|5.0|Its clean and nice book it took little long to take however its good and there is no scretch any things<br />Thanks A lot
0553381407|4.0|If you've read any psychology self-help books in the past about dysfunctional families, then you will recognize much of the ground this book covers. It has much of the currently accepted insights about recovering from toxic families, and has them written in a very straightforward, actionable manner. Where this book differs is that it offers more concrete suggestions when coming up with a recovery plan than some of the other books I read. Another major difference is that it deviates from most other books in two key areas: unlike other books, this one says that forgiveness is not necessary or key for moving on. Although it does agree with the accepted wisdom that revenge and bitterness is fruitless, it makes a convincing case about why that doesn't mean one has to go as far as to forgive one's parents either. The other area where it differs from many other self-help books is that it considers confrontation of one's parents to be very necessary, rather than an optional step or a step one should avoid altogether. I agree with both these views, especially the confrontation part.<br /><br />It doesn't go as deeply into the psychodynamics analysis and discussions of the roots of dysfunctional families as some other books are, because it is more focused on conveying actionable recovery strategies in plain English. Whether this is a plus or minus to you depends on what you want from a book. If you like deep psychodynamic discussion or psychoanalysis, this is not for you. But what the book does do, it does very well.
B008XG1X18|4.0|its a great app, however I do have problems getting it to open at times- sometimes taking 3 or 4 attempts. But once loaded it can keep me entertained for hours.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The acting and direction are very good.  It is a very good story, lush interiors and beautiful exteriors on the set.  Maggie Smith's lines are great zingers.  Very good cast.
B0010AN7Y0|4.0|Not you typical British country weekend movie. Great ensemble cast with Laurie and Fry back together and Branagh and Thompson (though I don't know if they were still married).<br /><br />For Harry Potter fans there is an entirely different Imelda Staunton (Dolores Umbridge in the Potter movies), as Laurie's wife.<br /><br />Well worth searching for or placing on your wish list. It does seem to pop up for sale at regular intervals.
B000T412OU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, It starts a little slow as the plot develops, but then it is non stop action. This kept me on the edge of my seat. That's why I bought it, I liked it enough that I knew I watch it more than once. I don't buy movies that I won't watch more than once. If you have never watched it, I think you like it and if you have this would make a great addition to you collection, a must have in my book.
B00003CX8U|5.0|For those who love to watch great dancers, the Fly with Me number is probably one of the greatest dance numbers ever created. As a former dancer I hate to think how long rehearsals and filming of this single number took.<br /><br />The opening, audition number is absolutely real. What is known as an open call in theater (or in film a 'cattle call')<br /><br />If you are not a fan of dance, you should probably skip this movie as there will be little to hold your interest.<br /><br />This is a very autobiographical film, very close to Fosse's real life.
0525953728|3.0|Interesting read but a lot of it is information on BUDS training and if the reader has followed very much about the SpecOps subject we already know this.<br />I guess there will be many readers who haven't followed the subject but due to the politics of this book they will read it so they probably need the info.<br />As for the Osama raid I found that to be interesting and different from what the White House put out and since this guy was in the position he was during the mission he should know.<br />I would have bought it for the Kindle vs hardcover but thought if the book had pictures they would be worth the price difference. The pictures were a big disappointment so if you have a Kindle save some money.<br />In the end you can tell the author and as he reports many members of the team are not fans of President Obama and I understand that position.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|This movie never ceases to amaze me. The purpose of acting is to emote. Damon's character has to suppress all emotion, for over 2 hours on screen.<br /><br />This is the story of a highly damaged man who finds his niche as a counter intelligence agent at the outbreak of WWII with the OSS (precursor to the CIA) recruited out of college about 1940, and follows his life through middle age.<br /><br />I find it hard to say he's ruthless, as his character never appears ambitious. Because he feels nothing, he is able to do whatever is asked of him, including arranging several murders.<br /><br />The character is much like La Carre's 'grey man' Smiley, without the intellect, as he never questions what is asked of him.
B000KN7BOA|5.0|I knew we have critics aplenty in a world that is very upside down, cheering the same rock hierarchy bands but this takes the cake. When's the last time you saw a review of this and how many Sgt Pepper and other ones have you seen?<br /><br />I finally heard some songs off Odessa, then thought I would start at the beginning, so that I could leave the better BG's stuff for later. But this release is a complete classic!! It puts the Beatles to shame with a much more care-filled, mature songwriting which the former often failed at. From 1967, I would place this as that year's second greatest album after Moody Blues' Days of Future Passed. If you like that kind of so called 'baroque pop' you should like the harmonies and arrangements here as well. I'm not a fan of 'To Love Somebody'(too pop-r'n'b/soul) and a few others personally, but even some of the bonus cd releases are awesome!! So go put some scratches in your Beatles cd's, (shoot yourself if you have Oasis, U2, Green Day, EMF ...) and get this one.
B00005N6KG|5.0|This is my 2nd set of these Sony headphones - having lost the originals in a recent home move. They are especially comfortable to wear - easily adjustable and VERY light. I use them for audible text using an Amazon kindle reader, so the sonic range, for my use, is pretty constrained, That said, their performance has been excellent. I did not experience any loss of audio over time (broken wires reported in other reviews) but used them with reasonable care over the course of 18-20 months. I will certainly not stress the wire-to-headset connection knowing now that it may be a weak point. For the price, however, you can't go wrong. Highly recommended.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game has an ease of use that makes it perfect to play for winding down. I would recommend this game to everyone.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|This book was very enjoyable - loved the concept.  It's not 'deep fiction' and the protagonist is a little too good to be true and the insights he has during the book (that are crossroads for the character) are ones that surely others before him would have had - so maybe he's made to be too good regarding insights that aren't entirely reaching the epiphany status that you expect to be realistic.  But using this character to explore this reality worked well regardless.  It seemed to end rather suddenly unfortunately - it could of gone a lot further, but the stage is set.  It's a great read and i recommend it.  Humour, imagination and the concept give it 4 stars.
0307949486|5.0|This was an infinitely better book than I was expecting.  From snippets of the movies I thought I was in for a crazy round of mayhem, torture, and murder, but Larsson has crafted an intricately layered mystery with some well-developed and likeable characters.  Like True Grit, the movies have overwhelmed the book to the point that likely no one will remember the fine fiction here.<br /><br />My only criticism of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is its unbelievable complexity.  We have a family tree with more branches than Queen Victoria's family.  I think it takes a good hundred pages to introduce them all and most are of no interest to the outcome. Each one had an alibi or lacked motive for at least some of the crimes so we can only imagine that they were teamed up for some bizarre reasons.  It takes some effort to commit crimes over such a long stretch, probably a team or else a spry nonagenarian. Perhaps we need a few extra characters for the next few books.  Larsson also throws in a lot of seemingly un-necessary stuff.  We have a romance with the aging woman next door, a stand-offish coffee shop owner, Colombians murdering a failed businessman, and casual romances among the protagonists.  I guess it is better to know that this is a great story, than to consider the values of the protagonists who are generally a sex-starved, shallow, poor parenting, and unlikely to help anyone except themselves bunch.<br /><br />We have an unusual mystery to solve here in that it is decades old and only of interest to one aging business tycoon who has the resources and influence to get a top investigate journalist to look at the evidence.  The journalist was set up by another tycoon and has just been found guilty of slander and libel, so he is willing to investigate a crime and write a history of a leading family.  He follows the old trail and it leads him to encounters with an anorexic researcher/hacker and the sadistic murderer on the family tree.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good and addicting game.. it a great time waster.. kids love it too.. I would recommend it to all who are bored..
B0052AC8C6|4.0|It's an allegorical tale applicable to todays political and social climate told through a story line that makes fun of itself.<br /><br />Should be fun for kids.<br /><br />And no one liked the spirit of the west?
B0070NSPCU|4.0|I echo pretty much everyone's comments!  What a great book.  This is a must read for any Sci Fi fantasy reader.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|The app works on the kindle fire as long as you move the screen to the correct heading, N S E or W. I use it on my iphone since it has gps built in. Manual movement isn't that big of deal.
B008WHTFL8|5.0|It's that hard rock that keeps your head banging. Those blaring vocals that pierce your soul. The riffs that make you wish you were a guitar god. Hot Cakes has it all. I can't stop listening... at maximum volume.<br /><br />If you liked The Darkness before, you will just love them more. If you didn't like them before, go ahead and don't buy it. It's the same ol' Darkness and it doesn't get much better.
B0000074EF|5.0|You must buy this cd if you like ten years after and don't have this one. It's worth it just for Boogie On

B0056BMK6K|2.0|The ebook;How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 Months! does not have a table of contents and is difficult to navigate through the subject matter. Most of the front matter is useless and appears to be filler material to fatten the book. John's information is helpful but is mostly introduction material. You'll have search for the details some place else. But I bought my ebook when it was only 99 cent so I can't conplain much. It was worth the money.
B001L62REY|5.0|One of the best movies in my war collection.  The story takes place during the French and Indian War.  It is very well acted, exciting, romantic and relatively true to the times.  If you watch this movie and then The Patriot the historic flow is wonderful.
B00003CXA2|5.0|its a very good movie my daughter watches it 3-4 times a month,tom hanks<br />was very good in this movie
B003TFUJD6|4.0|In my opinion the director should have fix it, some parts of the movie, you can still see the cables haging from some of the flying props, it looked kinda corny! Plus they should have made a booklet showing pics of how the movie was made and a bio of all the actors who played each of the characters. I mean its been 30 years for pete's sake!!! unless mine didn't come with it, then that sucks big time. I would love to see it made into a continuation of the original time-line NOT a remake that would kill it. FLASH lives!!!!

B001N1DPDE|5.0|You really have to get this knife in your hands to appreciate what a beast of a knife this is. I haven't yet gotten to test it but from what I can feel and from previously field testing my gear extensively, I can tell this one won't let me down. If you look at some of the destruction tests online you will know why they call this knife the \\"trainwrecker\\". If you are having doubts about getting one, don't. I can assure you that you will be happy with the purchase.<br /><br />Cons: (little as tho they are and pale in comparison of the pros). It is a heavy knife. Actually really heavy, for a 5.5\\" blade you are getting a pound (that's 1 lb.) of .25 inch thick piece of steel honed to a razor edge. The sheath sucks, it just does, when on the belt it flops over and makes it awkward. The grivory handles can be a little slick at times and I would suggest upgrading to the micarda handles.<br /><br />Pros: Razor sharp, built like a tank, coated to help prevent rust, sabre grind for heavy duty work, .25 inches thick. It would be really freakin hard to break this knife and I've seen some of the destruction tests and it holds up beautifully.<br /><br />Hope this review helps!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I'm jumping from a 3rd gen iTouch to a Galaxy S3, and I have been a big fan of Calengoo since I first found it in the spring of 2010. It really is a well-oiled app, has great support and frequent fixes to things I didn't even know were wrong with it. It is also probably best-in-class for offline calendar support, as least on iOS, I'm still new to Android. I love the integration with tasks lists,and the ability to view all of your lists at once.<br /><br />This has also got to be the most highly customizable calendar app I can even imagine. It's as if all of the display settings are accessible from the menu, so if you're the picky type, you can really fine-tune it to your preferences. You can change just about everything, it feels like, about the display, from the colors to the font and font size to how much of your calendar event details are displayed on quick views, and all kinds of good stuff. It's really nice for getting it just the way you want it. The test drive feature in Amazon's App store is pretty decent for getting a quick overlook, and you can look at all the options under \\"display and use.\\" Be sure to view the \\"all\\" settings (versus \\"basic\\" \\"advanced\\" or \\"expert\\") if you really want a glimpse at the nitty-gritty customization options.<br /><br />As far as differences between this and the iOS version, they're pretty similar, and the Android version benefits from Android's settings menu structure. On iOS if you view the advanced or expert or all settings selection, you could be scrolling for days to get to the bottom. Android divides the menu into different views or scenarios, very helpful. Also, the tabs for switching between views are much better in android, as is the full-month sized calendar picker. I haven't used the widgets enough yet, so I'll update that when I get to that.<br /><br />Overall, definitely worth the $6 normal price, and absolutely worth the 50% off price I grabbed it for, especially when I was gonna get it anyway. Works fine on budgethardware and doubly good on the extra-fancy machines.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Excellent book by Ken Follett.  I've enjoyed all his books that I have read and will continue to read them all.  Great writer and I love the historical fiction he writes about.

B00866H7SS|4.0|Sylvia Day is a practiced writer and this is her best book so far. If you like looooots of sex AND a story, this is a good book. Gideon and Eva do it like rabbits. The scenes are well written and didn't make me feel sick as fifty shades' did, however they are a bit gross. The story flows. I've already bought the following book.
1936608898|5.0|The book is awesome. They explain science-y stuff very simple and easy, and I really felt that I look at my food habbits totally different now. I really want to nourish my body properly instead of eating stuff that harms me. I finished the Whole30 program and recommend it to everyone. It is great for understanding how particular foods influence your very body, how to eat and why. The book is really life-changing. I highly recommend it to everyone who struggles with different health conditions, are overweight or have some eating disorderes. This is so worth it!
1402270275|4.0|I honestly don't know where to start, this book really exceeded my expectations. The author was able to uniquely combine quite a few genres - a paranormal, romantic, historical fiction with a few steampunk elements to it! I was blown away with Bec McMasters writing, unique characters and vampire...<br /><br />Kiss of Steel takes place in the dark streets and mysterious fogs of London, where the poor are ruled by the blue-blood royals (humans infected with the vampire virus) and pay their taxes with pints of blood.<br />Honoria Todd is doing her best to keep her secrets and her little family together, but as hard as she tries to, she knows that her time is limited and that eventually her secrets will be discovered, and the enemy who hunts her will find her. Honoria is not a 'damsel in distress' by choice - she is strong, smart and very capable - but without her former social status, money and the proper care for her 'sick brother' - so when the local master, Blade, sends one of his people knocking on her door to bring her in for questioning, she has no choice but to go and hope that things work out, to her favor.<br />Blade, at first sight, looks brutal and there is no doubt as to why he is so feared. But Honoria does something to him that he has never felt in his whole existence. And he is determined to not only find out why, but wants to protect her... and, in his words, \\"make her mine.\\"<br />The connection between Honoria and Blade is almost an instant kind of love, I say almost because of the pace of the story, not because of the typical 'light-switch' we see often. Every scene between these two was mesmerizing and entertaining, the banter was comical at times, and the attraction was steamy and written quite tastefully - definitely an adult read!<br /><br />The story is told from both Honoria's and Blade's perspectives, it was so well written that you barely noticed the transition, you always knew who was speaking and thinking... though bits of the story were predictable, close to the end, there is a surprise and then things were left in the most perfect way! No loose ends, but with the possibility of a second book. Can't wait!dictable, close to the end, there is a surprise and then things were left in the most perfect way!

B001AFF25W|2.0|The book shows 21 different WAYS to tackle procrastination; you just choose which one works for you. For some reason, the book bored me to sleep. First, is the wording and secondly, the 21 different strategies are almost too similar. The words that he uses are toooo boring, words that can be used in a lecture or seminar, not a book. I wished someone had read me the book instead!
0375507256|4.0|[[ASIN:0375507256 Cloud Atlas: A Novel]]<br /><br />I saw a trailer for an upcoming movie starring Halle Berry and Tom Hanks. I was immediately interested so I read the book Cloud Atlas. It was absolutely incredible and suspenseful. It was a completely different suspense from that of a murder mystery but one of pure intrigue - it was like I needed to know why I read what I just read, what happens next. It has been a long time since I read a book that kept me guessing this way or left me in such a state of wonder. All I can say wow.
1475143389|5.0|The book is simply what you need, briefly and honestly written, the best book I have read until now, and I read alot on this subject. Mike has totally figured out what we, average people who wants to know the nuts and bolts of getting healthy and lean, and he listened to his friends advice and wrote this book. He saved me time and money big time! I reccomend everyone to read this, to know the right exercises, the right nutrition, the  myths and facts about getting lean. I also believe that more than half of the \\"trainers\\" should also read this book and think again their own methods. Mike puts everything in the book, which could take you years to learn otherwise if you choose to try and see. Thnak you so much Mike for writing this great book.

B005LAIGRS|4.0|Powerhouse performances from the two leads Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds, as well as the nice photography of South Africa, give \\"Safe House\\" an edge over other spy action thrillers. The story is too thin; action set-pieces are familiar; and supporting actors including Rubén Blades, Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson, Robert Patrick and Sam Shepard are typecast and rather wasted. But the film's brisk pace and raw energy almost make up for the lack of a more coherent and convincing storyline.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds is a young CIA agent Matt Weston stationed in South Africa in charge of a \\"safe house.\\" His assignment has been a monotonous and uneventful one until Denzel Washington's Tobin Frost, a former CIA operative gone rogue, is brought to him. When his safe house is under attack from a group of heavily armed men, Matt Weston has to learn quickly how to survive, while running away from the assassins with Tobin Frost.<br /><br />Action sequences include a car chase in the street, shoot-outs and close combats. Because Washington's character is a master of interrogation, he gets into psychological warfare with the young agent, who, when they first meet each other, is obviously no match for Tobin. Also, \\"Safe House\\" in part looks like a road movie, where a younger and more inexperienced agent learns from the elder and seasoned one. And there is Matt's love interest Ana (Nora Arnezeder), who still does not know the real job of her boyfriend.<br /><br />Thus \\"Safe House\\" tries to do many things within its 115 minute running time, but it is most effective when focusing the two leading actors. This is a slick action film featuring strong performances from talented leads, and the first-rate stunts undermined by busy camera work and hectic editing.
0143123173|5.0|I read a lot, travel a lot and love it when I find an author who can not only give me a great story to disappear into, but a believable one without all the relentless language or simplemindedness of the usual fare.<br />Craig Johnson writes so much like another favorite author of mine, Gary Cook, that I had to check both front & back covers to make sure he wasn't using a pseudonym or that Cook and Johnson weren't somehow related. Strangely, no. One writes of backwoods Tennessee and the other of backwoods Wyoming and both writers are eerily like-minded.<br />It was an excellent few hours spent and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the Longmire books.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|A very funny, yet touching story. Beautiful scenery and photography.Having visited Hawaii, and especially the island of Kauai, it was very meaningful.<br />Excellent performances from the entire cast.
B006O7XOOW|2.0|My 15-month-old loves playing with balls and loves music, so I thought this would be a great toy for him.  I was so wrong.  He likes to put the balls into something, not on something, so he doesn't like putting them in the center to lift up and go over the edge--he is much to impatient for that and just takes the balls out to play with them.  His friend (same age) came over for a play date and did the same thing.  He gets the spinner to make the music play and all, but doesn't wait for the balls to \\"explode.\\"  It would be much better if the balls needed to be put inside something and then exploded out of that.  Kids like to put things into holes, not place them on top of things.<br />I don't like that when the balls go over the edge half the time they don't land in the bottom of the legs, but go flying all over the floor.  I felt like I was chasing balls more than letting him play with the toy.  After just one day we are already missing one ball.<br />Oh, and the 2nd day of having this toy freaked my son out.  He started crying from the noises it was making.  I'm not sure why, but he wouldn't go near it.  So, this toy will not be taking up precious floor space any longer.  I'm putting it away for now...maybe he will like it more later, but I am not sure that I will.<br /><br />A word about assembly--this is not just snap and go...it requires you to screw in the legs to the top.  I had a very difficult time getting the screws all the way in or in at all (I have it assembled minus one screw) because it seems the screws are just a hair too large for the holes.  It was not a good idea for me to put this together with my son around, either...he was irritated that he couldn't play with it right away.  On top of his irritation, I had to make sure to keep all the screws out of his reach as well as the batteries I had ready to go into it (man that kid is fast and can reach a lot higher than I thought!).
B005HS00ZU|5.0|This concert movie is simply amazing. You really need to watch it in 3D with a good sound system. I have a Panasonic 55ST30 plasma along with a Marantz SR6006. Speakers are Paradigm Studio 20's and Studio 10's for surrounds. I was bowled over completely by the immersive effect. I felt like I was actually at the concert. This movie has quite the goosebump effect.<br /><br />If you like Peter Gabriel even a little you owe it to yourself to get this blu-ray. It's very well recorded and his performance was spot on. The orchestra and back up singers were also simply stunning.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I like the preset 'work day' feature, and the alarm volume that steadily increases until you 'dismiss' or hit snooze.  Maybe the paid version has bigger buttons, because even at the biggest setting, I wish the 'dismiss' button was larger in the free version.

B0000JCFPE|4.0|A famous musician is murdered while having sex with a blonde woman.  The ex-rock star is tied to the bed by the blonde woman who then stabs him to death.  Detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglass) is the lead investigator on the case.  The police find drugs at the scene of the crime and his girlfriend was seen leaving the dead man's night club with him at around midnight.<br /><br />The police go to visit his girlfriend's house to talk with her.  She lives in a beautiful mansion alone and she is Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) a wealthy author.  She is beautiful and arrogant and tells the police to leave.  She is worth over $110 Million left to her by her parents.  Last year she published a book about a woman who killed her boyfriend rock star with an ice pick and she ties his hands with a white scarf....<br /><br />This is a suspenseful movie thriller that has one of the most talked about erotic scenes in the last 10 years.  It is a will of minds and Catherine is a match for the police in every way.  The cast in this movie is very good and they do an excellent job playing their roles in this film.  Nick is trapped between two beautiful women and his life is miserable for multiple reasons.  You have to watch this movie and make up your own mind, which one did it!
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Steinbeck and unfamiliar readers merit at least the first page of this American masterpiece. Unfortunately the sample shines light only on 2500 words of a Foreward by a proxy.  Streinbeck is quite able to sell himself. Surely, this is an unintened slight that Amazon and the publisher will want to readily fix.  Thank you.

B0084IHVC0|4.0|One of Disney's latest offerings on Blu-ray is the classic animated feature \\"The Aristocats.\\" It's interesting that the Mouse House released two 1970s era films in the same month. This one boasts a jazzy soundtrack that will have viewers of all ages tapping their feet. It's of note that this was the last movie Walt Disney approved before his death in 1966.<br /><br />The scheming butler of a rich Parisian socialite kidnaps her beloved mother cat and kittens after overhearing the woman's plans to leave her inheritance to the pets. A smooth-talking tomcat helps the high-society house cat and her family finds their way back home. They meet all kinds of interesting characters along the way.<br /><br />This is standard Disney in all its shining glory. It promotes family and shows the audience that good always overcomes evil in the end. The story comes off as a \\"101 Dalmatians\\" for cat lovers, but doesn't completely duplicating it. The pacing is good and keeps the action moving forward.<br /><br />The characters are all memorable and quirky in their own ways. Eva Gabor voices the feline Duchess with her usual refined Hungarian accent. Phil Harris is fabulously sassy as the free-spirited and swinging alley cat Thomas O'Malley. Scatman Crothers is perfectly cast as Scat Cat, the leader of an interracial jazz group.<br /><br />The high-definition picture and audio will please Disney enthusiasts. All the colors are more vibrant than they've ever been. The 5.1 surround sound guarantees you'll hear every line of dialogue and every instrument strummed or banged on during the musical numbers.<br /><br />Disney packed the Blu-ray edition full of bonus material. It features a lost opening sequence, the \\"Oui Oui Marie\\" music video, and a classic deleted song entitled \\"She Never Felt Alone.\\" There are also featurettes including \\"The Sherman Brothers: The Aristocats of Disney Songs\\" and an excerpt from \\"The Great Cat Family\\" hosted by Walt Disney. It also contains the classic short bonus \\"Bath Day,\\" \\"The Aristocats\\" Scrapbook, and a language game. You can choose to play the movie with on-screen lyrics as well.<br /><br />The 2-Disc Blu-ray + DVD Special Edition of \\"The Aristocats\\" is a must-have for every collector of Disney movies in a high-definition format. A new digital transfer and new special features makes it highly recommended. It's a true classic that fits perfectly next to \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" and \\"The Rescuers\\" in your movie library.nus \\"Bath Day,\\" \\"The Aristocats\\" Scrapbook, and a language game.

B007TML4EI|4.0|I saw all the obvious dev reviews and waited to download until some real reviews were posted.  Ignore the one star hate.  The game is pretty cool.  It is nice to play a game that is fun and makes you think.  If you have trouble beating it, google buttress.<br /><br />Fun faotd.
0525953728|5.0|At first I didn't want to read this book because I thought of it like many others, as an act of betrayal and this guy is only out for money.<br />If this is your thought as well, I urge you to let your curiosity get the best of you as I did and read it.  He actually wrote the book to set the record straight about how the raid really went down, in contrary to all the misinformation that we received from the media and Washington.  He also is donating most of the proceeds from the book to veteran affairs and SEALS charities.  So before you go judging one of the closest thing we have as a real life super hero, know that we could have been stuck with the version that we were allowed to hear.  Also, the names in the book were changed to protect the 24 members on the team and intelligence groups reviewed the book to make certain no classified info was leaked....this info was not unlike info that we would get from a magazine article or CNN report.<br /><br />I am thankful that I picked this book up, I read it in 6 days and that's with a job and a family with 2 kids, I just didn't want to put the book down.  It was an easy read and I believe Mark Owen did a very good job of writing this and keeping you on the edge of your seat.  He discusses how he was in SEAL team 5 and then wanted to be in the DEVGRU unit, which is the elite of the SEALS.  This man was literally a part of the best of the best, who talked of being accepted into DEVGRU, to several different missions that he was apart of.<br /><br />I love the fact that we have such an amazing military and often forget how blessed we are to have the people we have to put themselves in harms way for our freedom and protection.  Also the sacrifice from their family and friends to do their job is beyond my comprehension.  Many thanks to any and all who serve!

B005CA4SQK|5.0|This is a great series with a good balance between the soap opera style interpersonal trails and tribulations faced in a high-stress situation and good, old fashioned zombie bashing fun!<br />The plot follows one mans quest to find his family and then moves on to the groups' ongoing battle to survive in this post-apocalyptic world.<br />If you're not a die hard horror/zombie fan there is enough here to keep you entertained and craving the next episode.  As we know, 'to kill a zombie you must destroy the brain' which is shown in glorious, gory detail.<br />Well worth a watch!
B005GRTNVE|3.0|Dissapointing music. Many songs were not to my liking, even though they were Spanish songs. They do have beautiful voices.

0375413405|4.0|I wanted to have this cookbook, even though Julia's recipes are too complicated. Great chef and her life story fascinating.
034580404X|4.0|This trilogy was highly entertaining.  The storyline was fresh and the characters were well defined and interesting.  Although some of the content is explicit this set is a wonderful love story and a good representation of how LOVE can conquer all.<br />That being said, I do have one complaint.  The author over-used numerous phrases in the books...to the point of becoming annoying.  I found myself skipping over some of the love scenes because it felt like I had just read the same thing.<br />Regardless, I would recommend the trilogy to any ADULT who likes love stories, and a good risque storyline.

0525953728|1.0|The West has a long tradition of killing tribal people, as its genocide against the Native Americans [[ASIN:0872863239 A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and Denial in the Americas 1492 to the Present]] and the current assaults on tribal people in the Middle East attest to [[ASIN:B001HWCNCI Blood and Oil]]; so, it seems fitting that the killing of Bin Laden was called 'Operation Geronimo.'<br />I suppose it's psychologically comforting to engage in this sort of glorification of the military, rather than to take an honest look at the incredible suffering our empire has been inflicting upon people all over the world [[ASIN:1567512526 Killing Hope: U.S. Military and C.I.A. Interventions Since World War II--Updated Through 2003]].  If people are seeking national security, taking an honest look at the violence we're responsible for may prevent another horrific day of \\"blowback\\", which is the term used by our own security analysts.  Korean war veteran Chalmers Johnson wrote the seminal book on the topic, [[ASIN:0805075593 Blowback, Second Edition: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire]]. Johnson argues that if we want end terrorism and our habit of perpetual war (something that the arms industry certainly doesn't want), we need to end the state terror that is being directed by the Pentagon and the war profiteers.<br />Even if the powers that be block efforts to transform our war-loving establishment into something more sane, there are always opportunities for people to create some peace and justice in their own lives.<br />[[ASIN:B00006L2TG Yes!]]

Many of his films (new and old)leave me scratching my head muttering 'wha...?', but this stands out as one of his best.  Don't dare miss it.  If you've seen it before, watch it again.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I'm such a huge Philippa Gregory fan! When \\"The Kingmaker's Daughter\\" was released, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it! I surely wasn't disapointed. I've read all of the Cousin's War novels Ms. Gregory has written and by far, this is my favorite; along with The Lady of the Rivers. I seriously finished it in only 3 days; I couldn't put it down! I recommend this book to anyone who is a history junkie like myself. \\"The Kingmaker's Daughter\\" is full of moments that'll leave you beathless and, I admit, I cried a little. Anyone who hasn't read \\"The Kingmaker's Daughter\\", please do! You won't regret it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not what I expected - in a good way. It's a much more mature book than people make it seem. I wouldn't recommend it for young kids though - all the violence and death and suffering gave me nightmares! But it's a delicious adventure.

B006OCM0G0|1.0|I loved this game until a few days ago I noticed it stealing my coins.  When I log in I don't get the coins I earned while away.  Then I'm sitting there touching nothing and 15000 coins disappear.  When I collect tips I lose another couple thousand coins.  Maybe it's been doing this all along but I'm in the process of remodeling and spent nearly all of my coins.  Now I'm watching my total trying to finish my restaurant and at this rate I'll never have enough coins to do so. BIG RIP OFF!!
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Since this is my first Reacher novel it was good to find out the back story before I read another. And I will read another as so many reviewers like these books and I 'm a fan of the genre, plus there a times you just want a fast, fun read.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed it to a point it did seem a little over the top in regards to the character, the violence and the train sex. So I'll start at the beginning and hope to uncover an author I want to follow for some time.<br /><br />But the real enjoyment for me was the added bonus of the short story about Reacher's beginnings as an unusually big kid with good psychological instincts and brute force. (Tom Cruise is going to have to use stilts when he plays him on screen.) I was sorry when it was over.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I somehow missed the original airing of Downton Abbey on PBS and caught season one on Netflix on line.  After the first episode I was hooked.  It took all my willpower not to watch the entire first season in one sitting.  Since season three will be starting soon, I had to catch up.  So I took the plunge and ordered the season two DVD.  It's even more addictive and enthralling than season one.  It's a three disc set and I have watched and loved discs one and two so far.  I'm saving disc three, if I can, for a while so as to have less time to wait for the series to start season three.  Anyone who loves historical drama, period pieces, or anything in that genre should love Downton Abbey.  I can now understand why it has received so many awards!

I honestly think most of the information regarding the mission was already on CNN. The back story and buildup really make the story come together. Well done.

0385738773|2.0|Probably contains some spoilers*****<br /><br />Buzzed through the first two books of the series, interesting premise. Fast action.<br /><br />Then hit this clunker. Read like a script for a first person shooter game. \\"Hero goes through new maze/action sequence then at end encounters stilted person who gives him new dangerous task. There was almost no character development throughout the book. I thought they were supposed to be selected as they were \\"very intelligent.\\" Not once was that demonstrated in this novel.  Again and again we see the same reactions Minho posturing and wanting to fight-even when it is idiotic to do so. Thomas stopping and gawking, mouth agape,  repeatedly.  This is \\"the chosen one?\\"<br /><br />Then there is Theresa. Yeah, the author develops an interesting intriguing character. We want to see her motivations, see her develop. But, nope she's basically cut out.  The author didn't even try.<br /><br />And that is the heart of the matter.  At the end of a trilogy one wants to have something of an understanding of the world they were in. Watch the characters we met in book one develop, or in some cases die. I compare this to Hunger Games. At the end of Hunger Games you understood Katniss, you saw her PTSD, you understood the split of main characters and what motivated them. Here, nothing.  Good premise, started, then punted. Too bad, as the author developed an interesting world.  But a book needs to be more fleshed out than a video game.

1582406723|4.0|I think some of the pleasure of reading this graphic novel was taken away from watching the first two seasons of the TV series. There obviously weren't that many surprises and I would say 75% of the graphic novel was like several of the episodes. Without giving spoilers I'd say certain parts of the TV series were better. Probably because they built on the comic which came first. Then again, some instances of the graphic novel were better than the series so I don't feel I'm biased towards one or the other.<br /><br />Anyway, this tale focuses upon a police officer (Rick Grimes) who gets shot, goes into a coma at the hospital and awakens to discover a zombie apocalypse. He then makes his way to survivors and the rest of the tale is about survival sprinkled with moral decisions.<br /><br />From Wiki: \\"The Walking Dead received the 2010 Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series at San Diego Comic-Con International. The series was adapted into the AMC television series The Walking Dead, which premiered in 2010. The television program has inspired a Kirkman-approved full length novel prologuing the comic book's timeline. The series has been translated into numerous languages such as Danish, Portuguese, Spanish, Serbian, Polish, French, Turkish and Japanese.\\"<br /><br />Written by Robert Kirkman with black and white panels by Tony Moore.<br /><br />ARTWORK PRESENTATION: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; HORROR THEMES/FOCUSES: B;  STORY/PLOTTING: B; WHEN READ: early September 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B.<br /><br />SPOILERS: I liked it when Rick escaped from the zombies in the city going underneath the tank and up the hole. I also liked that one of the dead men within came to life suddenly and he used his gun and hurt himself with the gunshot. The killing of Shane so easily, well, I think the series milked it for a longer period of time. Rick's fears are demonstrated visually far better in the graphic novels than the series though I suspect too much fear would have turned theTV masses off.

0691152640|2.0|This book provides simple descriptive statistics and summaries of various types of financial crises, using new data. I called it a disappointment for two reasons. The authors provide simple analysis that, as they acknowledge, provide no real causal insights - they are just showing simple correlations and patterns. They could have tested some real hypotheses using even modestly more advanced methods. Alternatively, they could have provided more qualitative information with compelling descriptions of how crises emerged and evolved, with case studies of key crises. For me, their middle of the road approach failed to satisfy a desire for comparative insight from case studies as well as a desire for sophisticated and careful data analysis. In the end, I learned a few things from patterns in their dataset, but they could have delivered most of the value-added in perhaps 50 pages, not 300.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|This is my first experience with a Blake Crouch creatiion, and it certainly won't be my last.<br /><br />This book is suspenseful, exciting, and really makes you question what's real and what's not.  For how convoluted the story is, I was worried<br />the ending would suck or just not make sense, but it really does wrap up into a very tidy package.  There were times when the story began to read like a Stephen King, and I began to question the sanity of the writer.<br /><br />After reading the whole book, the writer, I can safely say, is not only not insane, but wicked crafty.  You come to realize what everything means and how it ties together, and it's done in an expert fashion.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about Pines.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|As someone who takes spending a lot of money seriously and had no intentions of getting this, seeing this for $60 on release day at Best Buy caused me to pick it up and say, \\"My god I need this\\". The box was amazing, yes, but the actual walker head and the screwdriver mechanism is probably THE coolest thing I have ever seen in a special edition. I liked the special edition of the first season with the doors and zombie mask, but this is something that is a beautiful piece of art. No, it doesn't look like the picture on the box, which is probably THOUSANDS of dollars is special FX makeup, but it's pretty close. I will attach a picture straight out of the box.<br /><br />For those who say to wait for the \\"special edition\\", in case they're unable to read, this IS the special edition! Each head is exclusive and the blu-ray inside is exclusive as well -- totally different things included, totally different artwork and case style.<br /><br />I saw a review on here saying that the head was \\"disappointing\\" because the paint was \\"badly blended\\" etc etc. If my picture doesn't prove how beautiful and realistic this thing looks, then I don't know what to tell you. For $60 on blu-ray for an exclusive, limited edition special edition, I'm extremely happy with it!
0439023513|3.0|Though not the most satisfying ending to The Hunger Game series, Collins does make some bold choices in her storyline.  I kept fearing the end would be a nice, neatly packaged conclusion to a messy, futuristic world.  This fear was bolstered by the many miracles that keep Katniss alive.  Being shot in just the right place, leaping for the edge just in time, hitting the hovercraft just right to blow it up.  However, the ending seems the most realistic part of the series.  This is certainly not a must read series, but Collins keeps the twists coming just enough to keep you turning the pages.
B005LAII0S|5.0|If you've read other reviews, you got the idea about the movie. This is a wonderful movie and I love the blue ray DVD and dig copy deal, it's a good deal. Some people don't like it, but I love the characters, villain, dwarves, prince and lily Collins. Thought it was an interesting twist and a fun ride. The chemistry and style is fun, witty and can appeal to male and female; young and old. It's one I'd those films you should check out for yourself, by watching before you buy. It's a fun, charming, fantasy movie. Enjoy. I know I did!
B006LSZECO|5.0|In spite of seeing a sloppy interview of Gillian Flynn on The View, I decided to purchase the novel.  Once I began reading, I didn't want to put this novel down.  The characters were odd, but believable and the story had so many interesting twists and turns. This story definitely appealed to the scorned woman in me. I look forward to reading \\"Sharp Objects\\" to see what interesting characters Ms. Flynn will come up with next.
1603427244|5.0|Excellent service. Now it's all at hand whan I need it, even the Italian cast on my Italian friens always uses.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Still continues to grab my attention. She has carried the story on well. Not exceptional, but good light reading and fantasy material.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars if it didn't force close so much. At least you can reopen it right away though!
B005NFW1JK|5.0|The first episode doesn't disappoint!  Damon proves his devotion to his brother even above his love of Elena by never ceasing in his search for Stefan.  But poor Elena's birthday isn't really a happy one for her.
0761169253|5.0|Not a full length book but still a great read. I've just instituted some of the changes suggested by this book and am feeling more creative already!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love pinterest, but the app crashes quite a bit. I suggest that they fix whatever is causing it to do that.
0807014273|4.0|Over all a very good read. Refreshing perspective on hardships and life. Had a little more references to religion/spirituality than I care for, but the title should have given that away, really. Not a typical holocaust narrative.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was well done. I read all three books and can higly recommend them all.<br />The only suggestion I might have would be to perhaps recommend a dialog or narration as part of the film as this could clue individuals a little better as to what is going on. It is sometimes a little confusing to follow (in the film) unless you have read the books.<br />Still, I highly enjoyed the movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have never read or touch this Fifty Shades of Grey series....at all and never ever will!! I wouldn't want to buy a book if it has no meaning of a good plot in it. I am not going to waste my time into this. Thanks for all the negative reviews because I never realized it was that pointless!! I would never even read it without these reviews. I just know it is plain bad! I still don't know a lot about sex and I don't want to know. I'll save it for my future husband and then I will have an idea. As an almost 21 year old, I suggest you do read inspiring books like all of Michael J. Fox's novels, especially his latest one!!, ummm Rex by Cathleen Lewis, Dog Years by Mark Doty and if you want the best romance.... Persuasion by the very best Jane Austen!!!!! I haven't read it all since I have been busy, but it's wonderful! I love the whole plot of it and I hope you do consider my suggestions.<br /><br />Keep the innocence alive and watch Disney movies or TV shows....Even though I am old, but I still love them anyway!<br />:D
B000MV90B2|4.0|This has to be one of the most impressive and authentic depictions of Napoleonic battles in movies, made when CGI and the high tech computer effects were non existent in the early Seventies.<br />The flow of historical events and dialogue in the script may not be accurate but the director has succeeded in building up the tensions and setting up the panoramic atmosphere of the battlefield;and the acting were great by the key players.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am the type of person who won't sit down to read a book unless it COMPLETELY interests me. Even then, I don't read super fast so a book may take me a couple of weeks. I bought this book on a Monday and finished by Thursday the same week. The book was great! It was a great account of a SEALs journey and it felt like it was written by a real person. The author didn't gloat about SEAL glory or accolades, rather he just told a great story from a first-hand perspective. I would recommend anyone read this book. As Owen says in the book, he is really just trying set the record straight. That is refreshing these days with all the media slants and speculation about what really goes on.
B002JVWRAO|4.0|I've been an avid follower of the adventures of the Winchester bros since season 1. While I do think that the mythology episodes are getting increasingly complex, this show, to me, remains the most entertaining American TV show right now. The characters, be it te leads, mainstay villains, or the weekly guest characters, are well thought out.<br />Season 5 is perhaps not as memorable to me as a couple of the previous seasons. But that's not to say that existing  Supernatural fans will not like it. They definitely will. I'm not quite sure how many new fans it will garner though, given the potentially complicating mythology arc.
B008602KQI|5.0|Though they took some artistic license making the movie, the changes weren't significant and I could see why they did so for a movie.  The actors were perfectly chosen for each role and they all did a great job.  The costumes were amazing especially the fire outfits for the opening.  Scenery was perfect too.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Admittedly I have never read the book, but was interested in seeing the movie anyway.  It was an okay action movie with some different ideas and some fresh faces, but I didn't think it was great blockbuster.  It was just an average movie.
B00785P2QC|5.0|very entertaining game. I could play this game for hours. keeps me occupied during the boring moments at work. great
B005LLSNNE|5.0|tara, i'm sorry.  i know its bad, but i'll handle it.  i promise.  you're my family.  nothing's going to hurt us.  not the cartels, the irish, the mayans, the niners, the ATF, the sherriff, the CIA, Clay - or Gemma.  i promise.  i love you.  now...i gotta go see some really bad guys about some guns...don't wait up.  i love you and my sons.  you're my family.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|The aftermarket stereo in my car was too old to recognize my iTouch and charge it at the same time. When I plugged it into the car it would play, just not charge. Plugged in this CableJive and it worked instantly! LOVE this product!
0920668364|5.0|\\"Love You Forever\\" by Robert Munsch is one of the sweetest books ever written, it expresses the love a<br />parent has for a child, this is my \\"go to\\" baby shower gift when I need one or want to add a little<br />something special.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It would really be hard to follow up on the preceding two books, particularly Hunger Games, but the end was somewhat predictable.  Still, it was a satisfactory conclusion for an excellent trilogy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is great and so easy to use. a ton of fun and very addicting. worth the time to download
B0089BSMZ2|5.0|Great album, highly recommended.If you like Anthony and the Johnsons you will love this. In vynil the sound really gets better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's been a while since I've read a book that I just can't seem to put down, but this entire series falls into that category. The books flow pretty seamlessly from one into the other and truly grasp the realities of war and not only the physical damage, but the psychological damage that it can inflict. The characters that remain  at the end of the series are damaged individuals, but they are survivors whose lives have been spared at great cost. Many places in our world are similar to this, with other parts of the world as oblivious as the population of the Capitol in the book. It's a very powerful message.
0593059824|5.0|This book arrived in time for my cousin's birthday and she absolutely loved it. It is in great condition.<br />My cousin loved the book that she finished it in two days.
B0086700CM|4.0|Its Fun to play.Downside cant play without being connected to the Internet because it stalls.  But great game to play.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was sceptical at first, because of the hype of this book series. For me, the three books had real entertainment value. It kept me up until the early hours in the morning, because I couldn't put it away. This happens a lot to me, because I'm so curious, so it doesn't say THAT much about the books though.<br />I think I would recommend the books. I'm 25 years old and still liked them. The ending was to me a bit abrupt though.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great puzzle game. The puzzles are fun, pressure free and addictive. What a wonderful fun and relaxing game!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works beautiful.  I love the way it let's you know it's time to charge and especially when it's time to take the charger out so you don't burn out your battery. I love how you can pick a Color for the battery water and all the information it gives you about your battery. I hope they have this app for my blackberry. I hope this review helps.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|A classic movie, as most of us already know. My nearly 3 year old kept seeing Cars merchandise and began to beg to watch the movie. To date, she had only enough attention span to stick with a 20 or 30 minute cartoon, but she held out to watch this entire movie. I wanted to rent it before buying to see whether it would actually hold her interest. It did! Good movie! My daughter also is very sensitive with any movie involving any person (cartoon person) or animal in the midst of any conflict or danger, but she managed not to get too emotionally involved since cars are the obvious source of all the drama in this movie. :)
1416550534|3.0|I won't get into a narrative about the story as there are many reviews that detail the story.  Reading the reviews; I thought that this book would appeal to me much more than it did.  The story didn't flow smoothly for me.  I kept having to go back and reread several pages to make sure I was on the right track with the story.  I thought the story had lots of potential; but just wasn't well written.  There were times that it got very interesting...then there were times it became boring...then there were times I was completely lost and had to read several pages over to understand where I was in the plot.  All in all I was glad when it was over.
B008XFB86Y|1.0|the movie may have been decent if it wasnt all in sub titles.  i would have never rented it had i been paying attention!!
0312379293|5.0|One of the best novel I've ever read. Compelling plot, interesting characters. To be frank I found myself plenty of time in a situation when I could not put the book down even if I had because the clock showed 3:00 am.<br /><br />A must read for everyone who enjoys first class reading.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I enjoy this app but it is always running and updating. the weather is usually right on and its quick to just check without opening the app.
B0010X73ZG|3.0|This product review is skewed due to the horrible ending of the movie, which is not Amazon's fault.  I typically will watch a movie several times and enjoy it more with each viewing.  Not this time!!  I was completely shocked and horrified by the ending since I had already read the book.  I will NEVER watch it again and it will be on my next rummage sale!!  Again, Sorry Amazon, not your fault! :/
1476712042|5.0|I read the whole book in one sitting on a plane flight and can't wait to re read it, loved it, loved it. Why do they make us wait so long for the next one though, want more of Travis and Abby
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I guess when the ladies raved on and on about this book, it made me curious enough to want to buy it.....well, big disappointment....all those two ever do, is screw, screw, screw, this way, that way....SO BORING!!!!!  Get a life you ladies!!  I guess the second and hopefully, the third, will have more of a plot besides F_ _ _, F _ _ _!!! It's just not MY kind of book, I always follow the best sellers, but this one REALLY was the pits!!!
0553275976|5.0|I found the characters complex and believable.  Many of them are shallow or superficial but that is the point - they are materialistic.  This is not the same as saying that the characters were flat, one-dimensional, or undeveloped.  The dialogue was well-written and conversational.  This was the easiest 500+ page book I have ever read.<br /><br />The book was insightful too for its criticism of the legal system and the materialism that pervades our culture.  I was a child in the 80's so that time is largely removed from my memory.  I've also been to New York only once.  I still connected easily with the plot and characters.  To see critical reviews complaining about issues such as these is sad.  If you can't read a book about a place you've never been or an era before your time then you're missing the point of reading.<br /><br />It wasn't long after I read this that the George Zimmerman - Trayvon Martin tragedy occurred and the fictional events depicted in this book served as an important reminder that I shouldn't jump to conclusions.  Does that mean I think George Zimmer is innocent?  It means I don't know and I don't think we'll ever know, regardless of what the legal system decides.<br /><br />Without wanting to spoil anything in the book, I honestly found the journalist Peter Fallow the most despicable character in the book.  Reverend Bacon was about as vile.  None of the characters were really likable and many were deplorable but I think this added to realism of the story.  In real life people are usually not very likable; just as in the book, I find most people to be self-serving jerks.<br /><br />I also appreciated how the story unfolded from the vantage points of multiple characters.  Each character had his own piece of the story and his or her own cliff hanger moments.  The plot was artfully crafted so that no character's actions would spoil the cliff hanger where we left off with another character.  That takes skill and care as a writer.<br /><br />This was a fun book to read with several insightful moments that, for me at least, spurred critical thinking about our legal system and culture.  What more would you want from a book?
B0053O89WY|5.0|How many sitcoms have made it through five full seasons with becoming tiresome and repeating the same plot twists over and over again? But Big Bang just keeps getting better and better. The new characters that have been added over the years have brought even more variety to the conflicts between the main characters, and the character of Amy has been developed greatly through season 5, with her becoming much more than just a female Sheldon. The season 5 ender, with Howard heading into space, was one of the best so far. Through it all, the show retains the sweetness that makes it such an enjoyable piece of entertainment. As I write this, we're still two weeks away form the sixth season premier and I can hardly wait!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was great, I couldn't hardly put it down, I love all the historical detail. I also like the authors ceative way of describing vampires, witches and daemons way of living.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Spoiler alert ***<br /><br />A team of so-called scientists who clearly have no experience as... scientists? A screenplay that makes no effort<br />what-so-ever to get out of a genre made popular by Hollywood? Insipid dialogues that make you understand why the<br />\\"Architects\\" of the story want to destroy us? Must i go on? I mean, there are stuff in this movie that are unworthy of a talented director like Ridley Scott. Is this another case of a brilliant director (like Brian DePalma) hitting a wall with a sci-fi flick (like \\"Mission To Mars\\")? It's Ridley Scott, for crying out loud! The man behind the first \\"Alien\\" movie and \\"Blade Runner\\". Knowing how long it takes to work on a movie, knowing how many people question a screenplay during the making of it, how can such a poor film hit the screen? Were there ever someone in the production going like this: \\"Wait a minute! This doesn't make any sense at all\\"?<br /><br />Who cares about the special effects? At this level of filmaking, we know it's going to be dazzling! It's a given. But what about the story? The characters? the dialogue? their motivation? Their actions? Who the heck directed this movie after all? It is not the same man behind \\"Thelma & Louise\\" and \\"Gladiator\\", that's for sure. Maybe it's Michael Bay? That's how bad it is! The level of stupidity is that low.<br /><br />NASA is currently working the details of a mission to Mars with real astronauts. Do you think they would let men in space with marijuana? Astronauts who look like bikers, pot dealers or what-have-you? Let's say we find a planet that could harbor life. Would it be possible for an astronaut to go up there without having any clue that they might encounter... life? Would it be possible for serious scientists to convince us of this long, risky and costly voyage by simply saying that they just believe in it? On a new planet, even if it's looking exactly like Earth, would it make sense for scientists to take their helmet off in a split of a second, without any analysis first? Analysis, by the way, that would have been made long ago, before even landing on the damn planet. Of course, there is a robot that will endanger the whole mission. Of course, the two \\"scientists\\" who are the dummest of them all will die first in a horrible way. Of course, there is someone on board who only cares about money and the cost of the mission. Of course there is someone who will keep the whole thing difficult to accomplish. Of course, there is someone who will have a change of faith. Of course, the main lady character will be the only survivor. Also, the love between Noomi Rapace's character and her scientist boyfriend, well i never believed it. No chemistry there. And Charlize Theron's character was too one-dimensional. She actually was the robot of the film. And sorry folks, but even if \\"Avatar\\" wasn't the best script ever written, it did wonders when it came to making us discover an alien world. After that, a movie who wants to do the same thing must be better or else, what's the point?<br /><br />When a talented director like Ridley Scott makes an error of judgment like that, it makes you wonder about his previous films. Maybe those films didn't come from his mind, after all. Maybe he is simply a director. Maybe he always was lucky and had great scripwriters. And for this one, he wasn't lucky and he had not-so-good scriptwriters. And since he obviously cannot make the difference between a good story and a bad one, well he did it anyway. That is the only explication. Ridley Scott is not so wise after all. He is simply a doer. A director who directs.<br /><br />I'm sure it's not that. But c'mon! \\"Prometheus\\" cannot come from Ridley Scott. It's worthy of Michael Bay, in terms of dialogues and character's motivation. And for the great critic Roger Ebert to praise this film, well it's beyond me. The humans in this film diserves to be eaten by the bad aliens. We were an experiment by the \\"Architects\\" and judging by this story, they are right to be disappointed.<br /><br />Michael Bay, get out of Ridley Scott's body!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I enjoy very much this DVD.  It doesn't seem like it's hard but 20 minutes makes you sweat like you have been working out for 1 hour. I love it.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|This was 45 minutes of story and concept at most.  The rest of the movie was filled with cute little things you've come to expect in animated movies.  The problem was, they felt forced.  I liked the movie, and I liked the voice acting.  The way the movie filled out just didn't work for me.  The musical numbers seemed like they happened because it was \\"time for a song\\" and there needs to be a soundtrack to sell.  Two examples that I think worked came to mind when this movie was over: 1) Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs probably had less of a story to work with, but the movie was filled out in a more coherent way. 2) The Little Mermaid had musical numbers that brought you into the story and advanced it.  The songs didn't pop out like unrelated music videos in the middle of the movie.  Those comparisons may mean nothing to you - and probably even LESS to your children! - but I make them to explain my 3-star rating.  \\"It's OK\\"
B006LSZECO|3.0|The plot of Gone Girl is fascinating. Must have take tne author some time to think of all those twists and turns, yet clever enough to tie up the ends. I found many parts redundant, plodding and the dialogue predictable. Too much interior thought.<br />Aside from that, it was thrilling. An almost ran.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|I think so far is the best dc animated movie, great story and great voice acting. Good extra content about the original comic story,  for the real fans, Jonah hex short much better than the crappy live action movie
B001F7MSFM|4.0|This is a movie I tend to watch at Christmas time.  The first few minutes of the film take place at Christmas.  There are some very strong themes in this film.  Being the last of your kind, the role of the father, the strength of love, and many others.  There is also not as much CGI as films of this nature normally have.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app really does what it says and is really worth the $. Works really well on my Kindle Fire.
B008602KQI|4.0|I recently finished reading the three books, thanks to this film.  I have an odd system.  I watch the first film based on a series of books before reading the books.  If I do not like the movie, I do not read the books.  If there is a second movie in the series, and I like that one, I then read all the books in the series.  The film is good.  It shows how everything is done.  The book tell you why.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this biography as she really took the time to do research and write authentically yet kept it where the reader could easily understand. The story development was at times heartbreaking yet showed the depths of strength that people had to have to survive. Love this book.

B004LQGXPA|5.0|First of all, the product arrived in a timely manner and properly packaged.  There are two disks included and the quality of the videos are very good. The second disk has several bonus features with a lot of added info about Patton's life.  One bonus feature compares what really happened in his life to how it was portrayed in the movie - very interesting.  I recommend this video.

B005LMEB8E|5.0|I have purchased 2 of Demi Lovato's other albums and loved them. I have heard her voice transition as she has grown as an artist. This album is a testament to the fact that she only gets better as she progresses.<br />  One of my highlights of the album, because it is such a pretty track, well executed, and just overall everything I want when I listen to Demi Lovato's music, is the radio hit \\"Give Your Heart A Break,\\" but WOW the album is incredible. The title track \\"Unbroken\\" is my FAVORITE of the album. The vocals are rich, full of emotional inflection, and the album is well written and produced. The fun songs on the album that will make you wiggle in your seat and bob your head with the beat are \\"Holdup,\\" \\"All Night Long,\\" and \\"Who's That Boy.\\"<br />  I think the label relied too much on collaborations. For instance, in \\"You're My Only Shorty\\" her vocals are beautiful enough to stand alone, the featured (unnecessary and a distraction) is like the songs, you hear on the radio, where they have remixed in a random rap sequence or shout out that is completely nonessential and out of place. Maybe they could do a remake \\"I'm Your Only Shorty\\" and edit out all the excess. The Dev featured track is good, but I already like her music, so it was just a bonus, even though it would have been fine as a solo effort.<br />  \\"Skyscraper\\" is the most beautiful song Demi has ever done and you can hear the emotional maturity in her voice and artistic expression. Considering what she has been through... WOW!; she has come through it better, stronger, and a more well-rounded artist. \\"Mistake\\" is a beautiful track, and is the perfect transition track from \\"Skyscraper\\" to \\"Unbroken\\" and \\"In Real Life.\\"<br />  The rest of the album is good, but these are the standouts and every team has  stars. Thanks to Demi and your label for making us this music. I am already looking forward to the next album :~)[[ASIN:B005EZJ3MW Unbroken]]
B008602KQI|5.0|I pre-ordered this and it came 2 days after it was released. I was very pleased with the shipping speed, especially since the package was supposed to arrive a few days after the day I actually received it.<br />This version comes with an ultraviolet code, so you can watch the movie on your tablet, computer, tv, smartphone, etc.<br />The movie was great- the dvd was flawless and played very well on my dvd player. Also,the second dvd is a special features dvd.<br />All in all, I was very pleased with the product.<br />edit: READ THE BOOK FIRST!!!!!!!!!!

B007N31ZBU|5.0|This is a must see and have for ANY fan of this film .It looks so beautiful in 1080 p! It always amazes me to see a film that has been properly mastered in 1080. There is so much more to appreciate in the film when you can see the details so clearly!<br /> I never seem to get tired of this film, a true masterpiece of film with so many  epic  performances from such a variety of actors!
0307948110|4.0|The Fear Index is a well-crafted financial tech thriller. What is fascinating is that our technology today is making possible the nightmarish scenarios that Harris presents.  Fiction has become fact. Our machines are advancing rapidly and we are losing control of them as evidenced by recent events ([...]).    I look forward to the movie based on the novel. I do not think Harris is not done with the Hoffman character yet.

034580404X|5.0|TOTALLY AWESOME!  I HOPE E.L.JAMES COMES OUT WITH ANOTHER BOOK IN THIS SERIES!  THE STEAMY STUFF DID START TO REPEAT THE SAME STUFF TOWARDS THE END, HOWEVER IT WAS A GREAT TRILOGY THAT I WISH HAD AT LEAST ONE MORE BOOK! I AM NOT A BIG READER, BUT THIS WAS DEFINITELY A PAGE TURNER
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is my 8th Reacher book and I'm not bored with this guy yet! Lee Child is consistent with keeping you the edge, wanting to turn the pages faster. Don't try to out guess Jack Reacher, you will be foiled. I wish I had read the Reacher Series in sequence. Is there a reading list? I've read about Reacher when he was in the military, out for several years, now I stumble on this one where he is newly out of the military.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|There was really no plot to the book.  Did not get that from the sample I read.  Would not recommend the book

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the next.  James draws you in and leaves you wanting more.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like it. Kinda challenging. Still really fun. The games are fun and cute. Nice graphics. It's not using real money.
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|Since I am a fan of science fiction as well as science fact this movie proved to be a great one for me. Jodie Foster is wonderful as the doctor who using SETI finds a signal from a distant galaxy. She finds herself ultimately building a machine that transports her to the source of the signal. On the planet she meets an alien who assumes the physical shape of her late father.<br /><br />She realizes that of course it isn't her father, but has so many questions she wants answered, that she goes along with the created scene. Her time is limited and soon she is sent back to Earth only to find that in Earth time she has been gone mere seconds, not hours or days. A controversy erupts decrying her claim that she actually WAS where she said she was. For those who haven't seen the movie I won't spoil the ending.<br /><br />What isn't mentioned anywhere in the film is that Carl Sagan and his wife were responsible for it's creation but he passed on before it was completed. During the film there are instances of a reverse letter \\"C\\" being formed by popcorn spilled on the floor, when Jodie's father dies. Then again in the grains of sand the alien holds when they meet. Again in the sky above the alien planet and at the end when Jodie sits on a cliff overlooking the canyon and sunset. What does it mean?<br /><br />The reversed \\"C\\" shape in the movie is a representation of the constellation \\"Corona Borealis\\" it was Carl Sagan's favorite because it looks like a radio telescope dish! The end credit's say \\"For Carl\\" and indeed Carl has a presence throughout the film with the these references to his constellation.<br /><br />Coupled with a wonderful score by Alan Silvestri this movie is a home run in my book.<br /><br />On a purely technical note, in the film, Dr.Arroway (Foster), as a child, is an amateur radio operator as I am. It shows her using the radio and calling \\"CQ\\" a general call for anyone to answer. But then she keeps saying \\"come back\\".... this is slang used only by CB radio operators and is rarely if ever used by amateurs with any experience.
0545265355|5.0|very good reading, lots of guess whats next, keeps you reading,<br />these trilogy books are a very good idea, cant wait for another<br />that is as good as this
B0077SGMXM|4.0|So far I am enjoying this game a lot. I haven't even beaten all of the easy courses,  and I have been entertained and challenged. I did not rate this app 5 stars because there is no way to save your progress in a 9 hole campaign match; I don't always have time to play 9 holes in one sitting. It's still a great game,  and I would recommend it to anyone
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|A good book.  I wondered about the title for some time, but in the end it was a reasonable title.  The book got a little slow for me after the narrator got to Canada, but ultimately got going again.  I dislike the author's political statements, but can look past them.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This game is well done and provides hours and hours of gameplay. Any strategy fan must buy this. Myself and a group of my co-workers all have bought it and play it with each other quite frequently (it has also become the hot topic of conversation at lunches...).
0374275637|3.0|Daniel Kahneman penned one of the more intriguing science books of 2011 in _Thinking Fast and Slow_. A cognitive psychologist, he applied his craft to the field of economics and won a Nobel Prize for his development of Prospect Theory, which accounts for an overlooked emotional aspect to rational economic choices.<br /><br />_Thinking Fast and Slow_ is part memoir, part meditation on science, and part textbook. While it was one of the most lauded books of 2011, that \\"part-ness\\" is a major problem with the book: Author Kahneman simply can't decide what he's writing, and the book is less effective for its split personality. The memoir reflects fondly upon the author's many scientific collaborations, the meditation on science offers a love letter of sorts to the nature of inquiry and discovery, and the textbook looks at how people interpret their world, especially when either (or both) the intuitive and rational aspects of human thought fail. That latter part is the most effective; Kahneman looks at the ways in which people make quick decisions based on statistical data and how that data can mess with their minds.<br /><br />That the book can't focus on one of its personalities leaves it less effective than a bestseller it compares itself against, Malcolm Gladwell's _Blink_. In addition, Kahneman makes frequent references to Nassim Nicholas Taleb's _The Black Swan_, a book with a format similar to Kahneman's, but which comes together much more effectively.<br /><br />Though _Thinking Fast and Slow_ can be a fascinating read when it mimics Gladwell, it falls down badly when aspiring to be Taleb too. On the whole, it's a book of fascinating facts, but also an often tedious, repetitive, and unfocused slog. The sum ends up less effective than the parts.<br /><br />Like so many books today, this one could have used a more aggressive editor, someone who could have shaped and directed it toward a more fruitful outcome. Yes, it can be interesting, but as a popular science book it lacks the breezy style of Gladwell or the almost surreal feel of Taleb. And that makes what could have been a great book merely okay.it lacks the breezy style of Gladwell or the almost surreal feel of Taleb. And that makes what could have been a great book merely okay.
0425263908|2.0|As someone who read The entire Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy & \\"Bared to you\\". I still think Fifty Shades of Grey is way better. Although I'm not fully finished with Bared to you. I'm about halfway through. Its okay. But way too similar to fifty shades that seems like a rip off. Gideon Cross is Rich, Sexy, great at sex, has nightmares, is possessive & likes control, is easily jealous. Way too similar to Christian Grey. I think Christian Grey's character is way more interesting. And its a lot more different storylines going on Fifty Shades that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Despite all the sex, fifty shades is a great story. Yes lots of errors in the grammar & repetitive with holy cow, holy geez & Anastasia Steele's inner goddess/subconscious talk is annoying & repetitive at times. But to me Bared to You doesnt have enough action or problems with the characters. In fifty shades theres car chases, near death experiences, BDSM stuff at times lol Its action packed and never really a dull moment. I got bored with \\"Bared to you\\" pretty quickly. The sex scenes are hot and a lil better written than E.L. James sex scenes. I think because Sylvia gets a bit more descriptive. But other than the hot sex. Its okay. I'm just halfway through. Maybe its the fact that I read fifty shades trilogy already that has just made me this book too predictable or maybe it'll get better as it goes on. But so far not that good.<br /><br />Okay now finished the entire thing in about 2 days. Its not that long of a book. About 300 something pages & chapters seemed short. Its okay. I wouldn't say its terrible. But its just blah. No punch to the story. Nothing that stayed with me way afterwards like fifty shades of grey. I think the characters are underdeveloped too. Still don't know what the heck Gideon is about. He kinda pisses me off and seems cold at times.  I think its rude that Eva says she loves him over & over. Yet he never says it back? Who would put up with that? I don't know why Eva keeps going back to him? Except for the amazing sex they have LOL! The only thing going for this book is the steamy scenes. Other than that..there's nothing even memorable. Its such a rip off of Fifty Shades. This author must really capitalized on the Fifty hype cause its all over the place in this book. Surprised she didn't put \\"Laters baby\\" LOL! I'm not overly eager to read the next ones. Can take it or leave. She'll probably have them get married and have kids and take on similar roles like fifty shades darker & fifty shades freed. She even has a character in here Margdalene that is TOO similar to Mrs. Robinson except she's younger. I don't know why anybody thinks fifty shades is disturbing. This book was a bit disturbing. And like someone else said a little too heavy with the molesting factors in here. I have a feeling that might be Gideon's secret that he hasn't really admitted to Eva. And Eva already admitted what her stepbrother did to her when she was younger. The scene she describe her brother was disgusting, sad and disturbing and didn't like reading that part :( Could've done without it. The orgy scene with Cary back at their apartment is a bit much too!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great controller feels durable and the wireless range is good as well i can play from almost anywhere in my house.  feels smooth as well and is a must buy if you want another ps3 controller that is similar to the original bought with ps3 console.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My friend talked me into this series without telling me it was soft core erotica. LOVED  IT!  I loved being a chairside voyeur into a world that will now be talked about. Hold onto your iPads! what a ride. five stars and waiting for more.....with a twitchy palm.  Laters readers!
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|Got here early, brand new, and I paid a fantastic price for it. What more could you ask for? Nothing. That's what I thought.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is addicting and fun!  they updated the old version.  it works great with the kindle fire! so much fun
0345533054|1.0|Gone For Good was not up to the usual standard.  Gory factor overdone, unlikable main character.  I would not recommend it.
B005H5H3LW|4.0|Many a childhood memories came storming back when the Yamato disengaged from its tomb and proceeded with its galactic adventure! Nice graphics, and even though they were a lot of dialogs and phylosophical moments, it rendered a good version.  Very good subtitles, and the action scenes were as good as the original version.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Once again Philippa Gregory sets the stage in the dramatic history of the Cousin's War. Interesting from all the points of view of the numerous queens .
B001RP1G0U|5.0|I had already seen this movie, but I was nostalgic and when I saw the title, decided to purchase the movie. I did not know it would have a \\"view shelf\\" of about 2 days. I simply adore watching these type of movies because they make me feel extremely fuzzy. It's a warm feeling that is hard to get now a days in other situations. Thank you
B003UESJEM|5.0|This movie follows the downfall of a handful of executives who lose their jobs with corporate downsizing.  Great performances by Afleck, Jones, Costner, and Cooper.  So realistic, and yet hopeful.  I'm so glad they made this film, that shows an important part of the American experience.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Had a problem with watching this movie. Stopped a number of times and was quite frustrated. The movie was good but the streaming drove us crazy.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|I generally don't like Clint Eastwood movies, but I loved this one.  It is a very good story of an elderly man who befriends his Hmong neighbors.  It is this movie that impresses me of how great of a director Eastwood is!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very good book, for those of you that want to spice up your sex life, I have read all 3 books, and I give them a A+, can't wait till the fourth book comes out...............
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Use for note taking, sharing notes is easy, replaces word for many tasks. Always in one place everything I need.
B000059QYB|5.0|I enjoy that I didn't have to wait very long for the CD to arrive, and I enjoy listening to the Billy Idol songs that I like the best on the CD.
B0064Z62R0|5.0|I saw this movies and really didn't get to absolve the sound-track.  However, what I was able to hear I liked a lot so i bought the album and really love the selection of sons and artist.  I would highly recommend this album to any Hawaiian who loves the Old Style musics!<br /><br />Bill
6305212112|5.0|This is one of the best movie I have ever seen.  It is funny and the cast are excellant.  This is a movie for everyone.
B0058YPG1G|3.0|i loved the content. Breaking bad is incredible. But one of the DVDs froze up and wouldn't play. Very frustrating.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I like it. The books are much better but they did well with what they could. The characters really should have been developed more, especially the relationship between Kat and Petta, but overall I enjoyed it.
6305268843|4.0|I like old classic movies and I love a good romance. This was a simple movie with not a whole lot of plot twists, but the story in itself was a sweet one. How a couple, both in situations where they feel they have no other option, feel a connection they cant break away from.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Just a lot of fun. Solid ruleset, well balanced races, and a wide variety of maps. Online community is active and engaged and the game has incredibly longevity thanks to them.
B008602KQI|5.0|Excellent and enjoyable film.  Your money will be well spent, I determined it is okay for young children. The price on Amazon is a fair price.
B005QYKD4I|1.0|Ugh! What a steaming pile of predictability this movie was.  At least I didn't pay to see it and was able to read a software tech manual while \\"watching\\" this. The plot is thinner than the paper it was written on and the acting, well its typical Michael Bay which means you can see more believable productions at you local high school.  It was easily an hour too long and the special effect have been used hundreds before. I think the saddest part was hearing Lenard Nimoy as Optimus Sentimental, I mean Sentinel. Gratuitous sci-fi pandering at it's lowest.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I got this game as a free app of the day. When it said it was relaxing, I really didn't believe it, but every time I messed up and thought I would have been frustrated, the music really was soothing and I just cleared the board and tried again. I enjoyed the challenges and would really recommend this game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read Gone Girl knowing little of the author or the success of the book. Like others, I was pulled in immediately and was set up expertly for each twist and turn of plot. I was intrigued by Flynn's ability to intertwine so beautifully the relationship between the two main characters with the thriller storyline. I was a little disappointed when in the second half of the book the thriller line became a little more prominent, but only because she had done such a masterful job to that point. The false notes were few and far between, and not enough to disturb the compelling flow of events. At the end I loved and reviled both Amy and her husband, a marvelous place for the author to leave the reader. A natural for a sequel, but I trust the author will leave the story where it is.
0345803485|5.0|I didn't read the book, but the girlfriend did. She loved it very much and now she wants to read the rest of the trilogy.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app for knowing you phone or tablet battery status.  Accurate, reliable, useful information at your finger tips.  Exact time for all apps and talk time makes this a must have app.
B008602KQI|4.0|I found the movie to be a fair adaptation of the book. Obviously there was a few changes, but that can be expected as the book relied heavily on inner monologue where movies rely more on verbal and nonverbal messages. The movie leaves you, like the book series does, itching to know what happens next.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was well written, maintained suspense of Hunger Games and encouraged the desire to read the next book. This is an enjoyable read!
B00422LESO|4.0|It was a fun, light read. I was a perfect read for anyone who loves Jane Austen and quirky romantic comedy. I suspended belief and laughed along with the characters.
B007N31YH0|5.0|We really enjoyed it.  My husband siad we must watch it again.  Many interesting and unexpected events throughout.  The cleverness was very good.
B0018ARNME|5.0|Awesome album.  Bought this for my husband and I'm listening to it more than he does.  Song selection and audio quality are great.
B006C1DH92|5.0|i love puss n boots so i love tjis game almost as much! i love fruit ninja to! so this is the perfect game for me.<br />GET THE GAME NOW!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it,  and their continued improvements are wonderful. The interface is easy to use.  I really like to have it at my fingertips at all times.<br /><br />One of the best apps of any sort,  out there.
0345803485|5.0|This is for sure a love it or hate it book. If you are a hopeless romantic like I am, you will love it! Yes it is VERY erotic, sensual, strange at times, but also very sad, and funny all wrapped into one. I loved the relationship the 2 in the book had. If you have an open mind, read this. It takes about 50 or so pages to really get into it, but keep reading. i couldn't put it down! It took me less than a week and I was finished. Looking forward to reading the other 2. :)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|It's such a simple concept that Hidden Variable came up with. Simply amazing. Even better, I got it when it was on sale for $0.99... and though it may now be $2.00, forget the haters and get the game. It's great for car trips or just if you're bored, and works great on the kindle. There's nothing you'd ever have to buy -I.e., credits - besides the game. A great game. Totally reccomend it. :)
B0071XO8RA|1.0|Punishingly boring.  Not a clue why so many think this is so incredible.  It's not the worst thing I've ever read.  But it is the most boring.  Dear god, so boring.
B007AQIZNG|4.0|Great episode! Love the whole series but I am getting tired of the Leviathans. Can't wait for the new season.
B00571F26Y|4.0|So far, so good.Well written book with several good recipts and makes me wonder how I made it to 74yrs is such good health so far.I've lost a few lbs. in the past 10 days and if I lose 20 more, then I will really give this book 5 stars.
B007JOM7C4|5.0|Loved it, couldn't stop listening...Put it on my Computer, Kindle and Samsung Galaxy III - wouldn't be without it! Exhilerating, Upbeat!
0525953728|5.0|Grippping, riveting, a real page turner! I loved the book! I really felt I was right with the Navy Seals. During their training exercises, I felt my legs ache, in fact my whole body ache! I was sweating during the raid at the UBL compound! The author writes in such a way that you really feel you are in the story! I am so glad that we have a first hand account of what took place. The author stressed the team work that is involved in any mission and really takes no credit except for the fact that it was lots of people involved from intelligence, to pilots to refueling personnel, NAVY SEALS, etc! It has been a long time since I was totally immersed in a book and this fit the bill! Thank you for setting the record straight!
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|I bought this for my 7, 9, and 13 year old(they had already read the books) and we all loved it!  It's nice to be able to watch a family movie that does not contain cursing or much potty humor, and is still funny.  We enjoyed this one almost more than the 1st movie in the series.
6305313687|2.0|Despite being as \\"Good as New\\", the DVD skips in every player I put it in. I several-minute blocks of content, and it takes forever for the player to try to find the next readable data. It's a great movie, but I expected to get a disc that at least mostly worked.
B004GYY714|4.0|Very good listen radio. It does not pick up where you left off. It always restarts at the beginning of the program . When you go back to listen to it or hitting the stop button. Fix this, it will be 5 stars.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After reading Wool I was left wanting more. The author develops believable fleshed-out characters with a gripping story line. This is a must-read for anyone serious about sci-fi! A modern classic that has bypassed the traditional publishing route.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was totally amazing. It was written in such a way, it gave me chills. The ending was SUCH a cliffhanger. I am seriously dying for the next book to come out. WHY MUST YOU MAKE US WAIT FOR A YEAR!!! Oh, and for the person that said that Annabeth dies at the end: THAT WAS SUCH A LIE YOU DIRTY LITTLE -
B008XG1X18|5.0|good app easy to use, no problems on my kindle fire! I use this app everyday and it has never messed up.
B00933JF74|5.0|I have had a lot of fun with this game! The design is cute and the controls very user-friendly. The production chains are just complicated enough to remain interesting. Highly recommended!
B004NS710C|4.0|Interesting story based on a real incident.  Thought it gave a different perspective on how the ordinary rail industry functions.  Great cinematography and action sequences.  The plot lines involving the principals were a little worn around the edges.  All in all entertaining enough to keep you watching.  Sadly one of Tony Scott's last films.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Great movie, I didn't know what to expect because I haven't read the books but it was a great movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B001NLKT60|5.0|It's not a cliche to say \\"I can't put it down!\\" A great follow up to the first book in the trilogy.
B0094M2O7C|4.0|I love the series but this was not the best of them all in my opinion, still a good movie though. I hope they continue the series, they leave it open for more.
014134010X|5.0|I really enjoyed the book, it was a great continuation of the first book in the series.  I would recommend it to others.
B008ENNXQI|5.0|I loved it! The characters were great, visually stimulating with all of the bright colors, and a well put together cast.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I can't get enough of Christian Gray. I am not the type to re-read book or watch movie again but I am going to read this series again as soon as I get my Fifty Shades book back. What can I say I love it, make me weak its unlocked a part of me I never knew was there. Oh and the fantasies.....
1612680011|3.0|I am an avid reader of personal finance books. I can say after reading this and a few other books on the subject that this one falls flat. Rich Dad Poor Dad has a lot of fans but also a lot of critics, and I'm on the critics side. I lot of the content I felt like wasn't new or innovative. Maybe it's that my expectations were too high, but all in all there's more hype that help in Rich Dad.
B00846REIS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. After finishing all of the 50 Shades books in less than a week, I was really looking for something to keep my interest peeked. After reading a couple of reviews I decided to give it a shot...I'm so glad a I did. The characters a much more convincing and the ending left me wanting more. Don't get me wrong, I still like my 50 Shades...but I can't wait to get my hands on the next one in this series.
B0061S073A|4.0|Great hope it works k so my kids cant charge to.my acct anymore haventel used it yet trying to figure it out
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book was amazing! I had to fight back tears in some parts of this book. If you liked \\"Lone Survivor\\" by Marcus Luttrell, you will probably LOVE this book.
B008NNA6OG|5.0|I was 9 years old when this movie came out and I don't think I ever saw the complete movie until now. I have discovered that most people think they have seen it because they have seen the actual Singin in the Rain sequence when Gene Kelly dances in the rain. But the whole movie is delightful - a look back at a whole nother aesthetic of movie making, visually enthralling, funny, polished - fantasy for post-WWII Americans. I loved it. I have been recommending to to everybody I know and they love it too.
B0068THAGY|3.0|This movie does a good job of building tension, investing you in the characters, and keeping you in the moment, and then it blows it in the last half hour or so. Others have complained about the long, overly dark sequence and I would like to hurl that charge again with some English on it. About ten minutes of squinting at the screen and I no longer cared the slightest bit what was going on, having given up in exasperation. Toward the end of that sequence, the movie segues into its cliched Spielbergian ending. One minute you're watching Alien and the next it's E.T. Ultimately Super 8 was like a punctured tire...it began at high speed and full of pressure, became floppy and hard to steer toward the end, and finally came to a grinding halt, completely deflated.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a great game that makes you think. fun way to pass the time. started playing and before i knew it i was making sure i got a perfect score on each level! simple &amp; challenging.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Fantastic, interesting read. It's not often that I will wake up in the middle of the night \\"needing\\" to find out where the next chapter of a book was going to take me, but it happened a few times with this book. I really hope there is more science to flesh out some of the theories detailed in this book because I found them very compelling.
B007PYFMZM|5.0|I asked my husband which Big Bang Theory episode he liked the best and immediately he said this one. It is HILARIOUS!  I downloaded to my kindle fire and surprised him with it when we were traveling.  We were both laughing out load.  Great episode, Great show!!
B000W93CHC|5.0|This was a great read and well written. Highly recommended! Have always liked Ken Follet as an author. Great followup to Pillars of the Earth.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|If you want a movie that will hold your toddler's undivided attention for 90+ minutes, this is a good one.  Right up there with Toy Story.
161707229X|5.0|Outstanding read, and a great escape .... author takes you along with her on this personal journey.  Highly recommend this book.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I've played Jetpack Joyride previously on iPad and iPhone, but was disappointed that it was not available on Android.<br /><br />There was always Run Run Bear (a Jetpack Joyride imitation) to play on the go. But it just wasn't the same experience.<br /><br />Now the wait is over.<br /><br />If you are thinking of getting this for the first time, be prepared for a fun game that is simple enough for anyone to play and enjoy.<br /><br />So far I have only played this version on a Samsung Galaxy S III, but have had zero issues. No crashes or any other types of problems.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that you will not be disappointed. Especially at the big old cost of free!<br /><br />One tip I'll share is to get the magnet upgrades for all the vehicles so that you can grab coins easier.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|After seeing Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man II, Thor and Captain America, including the short - form 2 - 3 minute prologues for each, which lead right into the next movie in the Phase I series, I can already see why there are going to be more movies about each of the characters, which I understand is going to lead to a 2nd Avengers movie, culminating the Phase II project.<br /><br />I did hear, however, that after the second Avengers, Robert Downey Jr is going to hang up Iron Man's armor, at which point they will have to find a replacement for him, like they ultimately had to do for both Norton and Bana, from the previous Hulk movies.<br /><br />I have not as yet seen The Avengers, but it would be fun to watch all of them in order, from start to finish, and have nearly 13 hours of pure enjoyment - for me, in my 40s, it would be like being a kid again, and I had wondered, for several years, if they would ever produce the series, which they now have done, very successfully.<br /><br />Already sequels for Thor, called 'The Dark World', Captain America, called 'The Winter Soldier' and Iron Man 3, for which, to my knowledge, no other formal title has been named, as well for Avengers 2, are being touted, which would make Marvel and Paramount even more billions in revenue.<br /><br />I just hope Stan the Man is alive long enough to see all of this come to fruition.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this game is not to difficult yet provides enough challenge to keep it fun. Game play is easy and intuitive.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Have earphones over a month now and are working great. Fit just the way I expected and sound is great.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Well written.  Harry continues to be a pain in the neck to superiors, but is tolerated because of his skill as an investigator.
B00122LXTM|5.0|Sure, I avoid my local \\"Classic Rock\\" station cuz their playlist is tired and worn out!  After hearing a song maybe<br />100 times, is there anything left?  The Answer?  Well, Sometimes. Take this \\"New\\" Doobie Brothers collection<br />for example.  \\"The Very Best Of The Doobie Brothers\\" has everything you need to put you right back into the<br />wild & wonderful 70's. The bad hair. The bad clothes. The crappy pot. Awful Cars. Just close your eyes and you<br />are there! Right now Im in a big field filled with people; friends. A big bonFire going and 2 kegs of Genny Cream Ale.<br />The music plays on while I go talk with a cute girl I just met.<br /><br />Whew..Im back. This record is really complete. Has all the great songs you'd expect, plus some that I don't know<br />too well. For a casual \\"Doobies\\" fan like myself, this has plenty to entertain you. And I'd say-Worth It !
0470913029|2.0|This book is interesting in that it looks at the diet of ancient civilizations but I would not recommend it for a modern diet, it does not seem to be nutritionally balanced.  I would highly recommend that you discuss this type of diet with your doctor before you jump into it as it seems to emphasize a lot of protein which can be hard on the kidneys.  Ancient man might have been designed to eat the type of foods recommended in this diet but modern man does not face the same kind of environment or challenges that ancient man was faced with on a daily basis.  There are much better nutritionally balanced diets out there that take into account all the medical & nutritional research that has taken place over the past several years.<br />Read this book as a historical look at foods & diets in ancient times but do not take it too much to heart for a weight loss plan for today.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|This is a book you read to the finish. Aside from being good history of pre WW2 Peking, it's a great detective story with<br />period characters to match.  There is plenty of arrogance and self-interest to go around--- tempered by the approaching chaos of empires in flux. Certainly the people of Peking lived in interesting times, aptly described in Midnight in Peking. Perhaps these \\"interesting times\\" offer insight to the China of today.

1402270275|5.0|Reviewed by SUZANNE & posted at Under the Covers Book Blog<br /><br />Honoria Todd and her younger siblings have disguised themselves and fled to Whitechapel,  the roughest and one of the most dangerous places in London, to get away from the Echelon, the people who murdered their father. Whitechapel is one of the few places where the Blue Bloods don't have complete control, instead Blade a mysterious Rogue rules over them and he seems to have taken an interest in Honoria, but can he be trusted, or will he just use them as a pawn to get the revenge he desires over the Blue Bloods he hates?<br /><br />Normally I am a little suspicious of books that have kick ass covers, the quality of the content doesn't always match the beautiful wrapping, but I am pleased to say that with this book, it was fantastic both inside and outside, I. Loved. It.<br /><br />The two main aspects ofKiss of Steel that earned it top marks are the new world created by Bec McMaster and the characters, especially Blade. Now I haven't actually read huge amounts of Steampunk so when I say this world was completely original bare that in mind! But it was a great mixture of historical with the setting being in a Victorianesque and paranormal with the presence of Blue Bloods, who were essentially a new and interesting take on vampires. I also liked that the Steampunk element wasn't over the top as although there were nifty gadgets being used and mechanical men, there wasn't women swaggering around in strippy tights, corsets and funny hats every 5 minutes and lots of weird and outlandish technology that needed to be overly explained. So I am definitely looking forward to the next book so I can explore this world further and delve into the more intricate aspects now that the basics have been set up.<br /><br />Now Blade...he has promptly been added to my list of book boyfriends, a very bad boy who has a soft spot for those he considers his family and of course the woman he loves and a tortured past, how was I supposed to resist that? But you can't swing a cat in the romance world and not hit a hero like that, but Blade had that extra something that had me panting, darkly sensual and struggling with inner demons but determined to do right by the people he protected I was doomed to love him.  Honoria I did like, but she took some time for me to warm to and although she was a good heroine it wasn't her that stood out for me.<br /><br />This book was well written, with an interesting and well crafted world with plenty of characters from some of the vile Blue Bloods to Blade's motley crew for you to get involved with, and I can't wait for the next book to come out and continue the story.<br /><br />*ARC provided by publishers I supposed to resist that?

I just couldnt wait to get to the end of it to see if there was an end to this sex catalogue....but nope there was none.....<br /><br />In India we have arranged marriages system... and the boy would like to know if the girl can sing or dance or cook well... well the girl should just gift this series to the boy from now on and say --- hey, these are my conditions... learn this book well and then lets get married.... U will surely having a rocking marriage i guess....LOL<br /><br />Having said all of that... we all have hidden desire in us to find a man who would treat us the same way Christian treats Ana... and since that is not reality.. we like to cling to anything that gives us that kind of joy... the success of this book purely goes to the fact that we all have this desire embedded in us.

Of particular novelty were the fight/boxing scenes, which, with slow motion effects were quite thrilling.<br /><br />The second film in the franchise left me cold.  As a matter of fact, I had to keep rewinding scenes because I fell asleep.  Finally, a day later, I watched the whole thing again, but still I could find little to recommend it, save the chemistry between the two leads.<br /><br />If there is a third, I will give it a chance as I like the overall take on Doyle's masterpiece.

B0076NKNLA|4.0|Although I have enjoyed my share of Marilyn Monroe movies, I've never been obsessed with her or made it my business to read biographical info on her.  I certainly know she died young, was married to DiMaggio & Miller, etc.  Thus, I cannot speak even remotely to the truthfulness of MY WEEK WITH MARILYN.  I can say, however, that it was an interesting film that engaged my interest throughout, and that it features an eye-opening performance from Michelle Williams.<br /><br />MY WEEK WITH MARILYN covers the time period when Marilyn came over to England to star in Laurence Olivier's PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL.  Olivier (Kenneth Branagh) was directing and co-starring, and felt that Monroe would guarantee a big hit.  For me, as someone who worked for YEARS in theater, I was in many ways most interested in seeing the clash of acting styles between Monroe & Olivier.  Monroe was trying to be a method actor (and she travelled with her own acting coach)...which sometimes seems like a crutch she is using when she's feeling insecure.  Olivier was more old-school, where acting was more about craft and instinct and timing and delivery.  When the two great movie stars come together, sparks fly.  But they aren't the sparks that create movie magic...they create friction and frustration.  I enjoyed watching all the British actors struggling to deal with Monroe's \\"method\\" of acting.  (Best of the bunch was watching Judi Dench, doing all she could to help Marilyn...she gives a delightful performance in a tiny role.)<br /><br />The movie is told from the point of view of Third Assistant Director Colin Clark (on whose memoir the film is based).  Clark is a young man, new to the film business, who essentially is the gopher for Olivier and everyone else involved in the film.  He forges an unlikely friendship with Monroe, who briefly comes to trust him more than anyone else around.  This alliance lasts about a week (hence the title), where Colin is practically living with Monroe, even sleeping in her bed to offer comfort.  There are broad hints that some of Monroe's erratic behavior is due to drugs, but for the most part, the film portrays her as very insecure and lonely and misunderstood.  While the film doesn't shy away from the ugly aspects of her life, it is safe to say they are left unexplored.<br /><br />The film is a fairly loving tribute to Monroe.  While she can be difficult, she is always shown fairly sympathetically.  Actually, almost everyone in the film is sympathetic.  Olivier occasionally blusters and acts out...but honestly, we can understand his frustration.  Overall, he comes off well.  The movie FEELS evenhanded and humane...it's a nice mood.<br /><br />Best of all is Michelle Williams.  She's done good work before, but much of it has felt SIMILAR.  She seems to play contemporary women grappling with some level of demons.  (BLUE VALENTINE, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN).  Her characters may have inner strength (MEEK'S CUTOFF, WENDY AND LUCY), but they aren't usually dynamic, charismatic, loud women.  In MY WEEK WITH MARILYN, we see a side of her that has not been much on display, and my estimation of her jumped up accordingly.  Her Marilyn is touching and grappling with demons, but she is also sexy and wildly charismatic.  When Williams portrays the \\"public\\" Marilyn, handling rabid fans or a crazy press conference...she acts so \\"non-Michelle Williams-like\\" that I was quite impressed.  Her many accolades were much deserved.  Branagh also does a great Olivier.  It's perhaps a bit more of an impression that a fully-realized performance...but he's charming and convincing and clearly having a ball with the role.  Others don't fare quite as well.  Emma Watson is bland (thanks to the script) as Colin's girlfriend; Dougray Scott doesn't get to do much as Arthur Miller and Julia Ormond is miscast as Olivier's wife, Vivien Leigh.<br /><br />This is not a deeply revelatory film, but it is highly entertaining and the time flies by.  The art & costume directionis flawless, including the reconstructions of many scenes from Monroe films.  It's a feel-good film about a real life person who was nearly on the brink of self-destruction.  That's contradictory, I know...but that's how the film felt.  It is certainly worth a look.is flawless, including the reconstructions of many scenes from Monroe films.

B007C4ZJ3K|2.0|HAYWIRE was a deeply disappointing movie.  Steven Soderbergh has helmed some truly outstanding movies over the year, and when I heard that he was making his own action-thriller with a great cast...I was pretty pumped.<br /><br />My first hint that this movie might not be great was in his casting of Gina Carano, a well-known MMA star, in the lead.  She brought limited acting experience to the film, which Soderbergh essentially crafted for her.  This is similar to the way in which he created GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE to showcase porn star Sasha Gray in a \\"legit\\" role.  The movie was well-nigh unwatchable, and Gray was okay at best.  Carano is also okay at best.  She's supposed to be carrying an entire movie on her shoulders, but through no fault of her own, she isn't much of an actor.  She's got the action moves down, and I certainly believed she could kick the butt of all these male adversaries...but when required to show emotion, or humor, or determination or any recognizable emotion...her skills were pretty tiny.  Again, Soderbergh apparently saw \\"movie star\\" in her somewhere and crafted this project for her.  I don't blame her for letting him...but I also doubt we'll be seeing her in many lead roles in the near future.<br /><br />HAYWIRE tells the story of a black-ops agent (Carano) who has apparently been targeted for elimination by someone she knows as an ally.  The movie tells its story out-of-order...and frankly, I'm not sure there's a good reason for that.  It makes the story needlessly complicated, yet adds NOTHING to the suspense.  We're essentially going from one fight scene to another, and the plot is so thin and the explanations so sketchy...all we know is that we should be rooting FOR her and against anyone trying to kill her.  I suppose I could have given more effort to sorting out the plot specifics...but the movie is so murkily filmed and so un-involving from the get-go that I had no impetus for working that hard.<br /><br />I had hoped for a guilty-pleasure film...but I'm astonished to say that even a mediocre Jason Statham movie will give you more vicarious action thrills, and will skip the artsy pretense.  There is certainly a case to be made for \\"artsy\\" genre thrillers (DRIVE springs to mind)...but HAYWIRE is just boring.  Carano has some pretty high profile co-stars, but their roles are either tiny and undemanding (Bill Paxton, Michael Douglass, Antonio Banderas) or the actor can barely muster up any intensity for their role (Ewan McGregor is bland as Carano's boss and Michael Fassbender seems vaguely embarrassed to be in the film).  Channing Tatum generates momentary interest...but his dialogue is also mush-mouthed at times.<br /><br />It's tempting to give this film one-star, but I'll stick with two because if nothing else, the one-on-one fight scenes ring with some authenticity...people actually seem to get hurt.  I think Carano could be a nice small part of a bigger film...something like THE EXPENDIBLES, perhaps.  But she is no star...no matter how well she kicks a*s.

159448385X|5.0|I have enjoyed a lot of books in my life. I have read some of those books just for entertainment, and others because I thought they could show me a lot of new things. One of my favorites was A Thousand Splendid Suns. This book made me cry and feel a lot of emotions on every page.<br />In his novel, the Afghan author tells the stories of two unfortunate women, in a country where the revolts for achieving power are in the street every day. Mariam and Layla live in this context. They are two children with a considerable age difference and from different places, but both with a tragic story behind them. One day their paths cross and their worlds are turned upside down. In time, they'll discover that their lives haven't a lot of value in a place as Afghanistan, and that they need to give support to each other if they want to survive there. They have to fight together for their happiness, although it's something difficult.<br />I loved how the book was written. I could feel every emotion as mine. This novel makes you learn about human suffering and cruelty, but also about willpower and overcoming obstacles. You can't imagine how people can suffer in countries like Afghanistan if you don't walk in their skin, and that's exactly what happens in this novel. You can feel in every moment almost what the characters are feeling, and you can understand why they're doing what they're doing. Once you start, you can't stop reading until the end.<br />In my opinion, maybe there is too much suffering in the book. You feel constant distress while you are reading, and it is so hard for people who have never felt this kind of emotion. However, it is something that has happened in other places of the world, and I think that we need to know it.<br />I don't recommend this book to people who are just looking for entertainment or having fun. This novel is much more than that. We have a lot to learn of people such as Mariam and Layla. If you are a reader who wants to know how far human suffering and cruelty are able to go, and how women can survive in these situations, you have to read this book. I would like to finish with this sentence of the book, which express exactly the meaning of the story: Learn this now and learn it well, my daughter: \\"Like a compass needle that points north, a man's accusing finger always finds a woman. Always.\\"

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I don't agree that you either love or hate these books.  For me, they were fine.  Are they well written? No.  Are they particularly shocking? No. But, did I read all 3 books very quickly? Yup!<br /><br />Hardcore erotica or even BDSM is not for everyone (including me), so it makes sense that a digestible vanilla version (like 50 shades) would become popular.  I didn't take these books particularly seriously, so their faults were not fatal to my enjoyment of them.  But a few things really do bug me about this series that I'd like to mention.<br /><br />First, Christian is an emotional child who never grows up.  He's way too sensitive outside of the bedroom.  That's fine -- but I seriously don't understand the obsession with the character.  I certainly didn't fall in love with him.  I like my men to be, well, manly, so he didn't do it for me.  But okay...this didn't ruin the books for me.<br /><br />Second, this really is a Twilight plot rip off.  I wish it were a little more original. But again, that's fine! I liked Twilight, why not enjoy Twilight with sex?<br /><br />Last, and most importantly, however, it really irritates me that a book with that much sex fails to do something that is so basic -- describe what the characters look like!!  I mean they spend almost 80% of the books having sex or being naked, yet we really don't get a physical description.  Oh sure, we know general hair and eye color. And we know Christian is \\"perfect\\" and looks like \\"a statute\\" and Ana has the \\"softest skin\\" and \\"great legs.\\"  But that's about it.  This is literally a book dominated by sex and we have no clue what the characters look like naked?  Ok...<br /><br />So overall, I understand why erotica fans don't like these books.  I get why literary fans don't like them.  I get why twilight fans and romance fans and conservative readers and feminists don't like these books.  But, in the end, I think it's all about expectations.  These are simple, poorly written, easily digestable sex books with minor BDSM scenes.  They are not particularly offensive or thought provoking and they certainly won't win any fancy awards anytime soon.  But they are fun and quick escape reads!  I wish everyone would stop expecting them to be something else and just enjoy them for what they are.ooks with minor BDSM scenes.

0439023521|5.0|This is one of the few times that I saw the movie before reading the book... I prefer to read the book first but didn't have time. Well, this worked well for me, because although the movie was good, the book absolutely blew me away; I think I'd have been disappointed in the movie if I'd read the book first.<br /><br />For those who have seen the movie only, the book is actually much darker. Darker than a bunch of kids being forced to kill each other, you ask? How is that possible? It's the strength of Suzanne Collins' writing that does it. She makes Katniss a flawed and not-always-likeable character... which made me like her even more. There's one HUGE change from the book to the movie... right at the end of the Games... where we see just how determined Katniss is to survive, at any cost.<br /><br />Katniss is an amazing character: strong, protective of her family, totally kick-ass, yet very believable. To me she's one of THE stand-out heroines of all time.<br /><br />I won't repeat all the other things people have already said about this book, so let me just echo that it DOES add up to all the hype. Just read it!
B00005MKA3|5.0|After many listens to this wonderful album it became clear to me that modern Hip Hop owes a debt of thanks to Bob Marley in many ways - &#34;Survival&#34; is one such example.  This classic record plays out like a true concept album; from the title, album cover (depicting flags of troubled Black nations around the world) to the song titles and lyrics, all screaming for the unification of anyone with African blood regardless of geographic location.  &#34;Africa Unite&#34; is the most potent example of this ideaology.  I feel as if every great rap album illustrating similar concepts has to have its roots in &#34;Survival&#34;.  One clearly evident example is the whistle-sounding keyboard lines at the beginning of &#34;So Much Trouble in the World&#34;.  Sound familiar?  Its the same effect employed in classic fashion by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dog on their early classics.  Bob Marley's original ghetto was Trench Town and his early work called for the rising up of the ghetto class; as he spent more time traveling and exploring different parts of the world, he expanded his idea of the &#34;ghetto&#34; - no longer just the rough streets of Jamaica, but anywhere Blacks are treated as second class citizens.  This album represents the pinnacle of that journey.  &#34;One Drop&#34; is Marley and family at their most gospel.  Try listening to this song and not feeling the pure joy Bob emits while reminding his people to be proud of who they are, even if, in the case of a &#34;One Drop&#34;, they have &#34;mixed&#34; blood.  Track by track, one can't help but draw parallels between this record and the great Hip Hop albums of our time.  NWA's &#34;Straight Outta Compton&#34; is the rap equivilant of Bob Marley and the Wailers first successful international album release &#34;Catch a Fire&#34;.  &#34;Straight Outta Compton&#34;, the single, is the hip hop equivalent of &#34;Concrete Jungle&#34; - young black men using music as a canvas to represent the plight of their communities and break out of their isolation.   By 1979, Bob had grown into an icon, and his vision became more prophetic.  &#34;Survival&#34; is the product of a social justice visionary gaining an international platform, one with the songwriting chops and world-class musicians to channel his message in a commercially and artistically palpable way.  One can only wonder if Hip Hop artists will transcend their genre the way Bob did, and deliver an album worthy of the praise &#34;Survival&#34; deserves.  Rap musicians should spend some time with this record before their next studio sessions and see if they can channel the same ideas through their medium.
0345803485|1.0|Terrible book. Not worth the money nor the time. I read four chapters and have no interest to continue reading. It is porn of the worst kind.
1612183956|4.0|This is a good read and as others have stated, pulls you along with the action from beginning to end.<br /><br />The book focuses on appearances which dissolve into illusions which are finally starkly contrasted against reality.  It is interesting to see how easily we can force ourselves to impose order on something so obviously out of control.  The protagonist has a need to know, but in the end chooses his preferred illusion as perhaps the only choice a sane man can have.<br /><br />While the conclusion seemed rushed a bit, the rest of the book was not.  I defy anyone to figure out what' really going on until the author decides to reveal it.<br /><br />This is good...and particularly for anyone familiar with that part of the country!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written, with well-developed characters. A plot full of suspense and surprising twists keeps you uncertain and interested until nearly the end of the story. What I liked especially was that there's more to this book than the story, itself. There's genuine food for thought about relationships and the dark recesses of the human psyche. I enjoyed it.
0525953728|2.0|The last quarter of this book is a moderately interesting account of the mission to kill/capture Osama Bin Laden. That 50 or so pages wasn't worth the effort it takes to wade through the first 3/4 of the book. The book is poorly written and very superficial. It's hard to see anything in this book that would/should get the Pentagon into such a snit.<br /><br />There are many other, better written and far more interesting accounts of the war in Afghanistan (Craig Mullaney's The Unforgiving Minute) and Iraq (One Bullet Away by Nate Fick). And, if you are looking for a book by a former SEAL, then a far better choice would be The Warrior Elite.  All of these books are well-written and draw you into the perspective of the author/lead character. Don't waste money on No Easy Day.  It's all hype and no substance.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The film was very entertaining.  The story was well laid out and fairly close to the plot of the book.  The scenery and sets were great at setting the mood and putting things in perspective.<br />I also appreciated getting the DVD from Amazon very promptly.
B00015YVD6|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS PURCHASED SO I COULD SHARE IT WITH MY GRANDDAUGHTER WHO LOVES MERMAIDS.  THEN MY GROWN SON CAME OVER TO VISIT AND HAD TO WATCH IT.  HA  IT IS A WONDERFUL (CLEAN) MOVIE.  THANKS
0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day is a fantastic read that peppers you with information about what it's like to be a Navy SEAL, as well as what it was like being part of the historical mission that ultimately killed the world's most wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />If you are someone who is familiar with the excruciating training that Navy SEALs go through before they become Navy SEALs, and after, then you may find portions of the book that focus on that a bit tedious. I happen to fall into the aforementioned group. On the flip side, if you're looking for an in-depth account of what would-be Navy SEALs go through to become Navy SEALs, you'll probably be a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Regardless, I don't think it can be held against the author since it's not billed to be an in-depth overview of how to become a Navy SEAL. The author struck just the right balance.<br /><br />The book is very compelling and discusses numerous missions besides Operation Neptune Spear that span over a decade in various countries. I found it nearly impossible to put down, knocking out the entire book in 6 straight hours. It is a quick read, as you can see, and I think it's a credit to the author for not adding a bunch of unnecessary fluff. There was just the right amount of back story and lead up to the main event that it didn't even get close to being boring.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. It is a book about an incredibly significant historical event not just for the United States of America, but for the entire world. We owe a great debt of gratitude to the people who fight for freedom against tyrannical cowards like Osama bin Laden.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Whale Rider was a great movie. It really captures the feeling of never giving up. From the beginning the movie grabs your attention with the hardship of the family facing a terrible lose and gaining a true blessing in disguise. The first born little boy of the new generation, the profit who they expected would take them out of the darkness and make everything better again, and instead his twin sister survived, Paikea.<br />The family in this movie captured a lot of traditional values that had been handed down from generation to generation. Traditions that were hard to allow change but it happened and taught the family that change is not always a bad thing to accept. This little girl was looked upon by her grandfather as being a curse.  He loved her in a way that the only thing she lived for was to please him. But his traditional values were too strong to let her in that he pushed her away to venture things on her own. The teachings to the younger boys about the old ways were stick and enduring. These were to test their strength, fighting skills, learning and leadership ability, to produce future warriors and future chiefs. Through it all the one that was looked at as being a curse the one that broke the line back to the ancestors was the one who lead them all back together through to a new beginning.<br />Overall, this movie had memorable moments and relatable moments were it teaches you about strength, endurance, the ability to allow things to change, and to never give up. Family played a big part in this film along with family traditional values that they all valued and held high, but we all learn that things change over generation and in some situations it only takes one to make a difference and to help start a new tradition.
B00884GR0W|5.0|it is a game for imagitive people and rpg players, it is not a game for game hoggers. I would recommend deleteing the light version and your most crappy game<br />before download.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|It was very moving, no dull moments at all. And things moved quickly so that you wanted to keep on reading. I finished the book rather quickly because it was so well written.  I purchased this directly from Amazon.
B007NZDES0|5.0|I was at this concert tour and turned to my friend and told her that it's coming out on DVD -- everything about the concert was flawless. This concert was beyond beautiful and having a chance to see it whenever I put on the DVD, or listen to it on my IPod is priceless. Definitely, grab this if you get a chance, you won't regret it at all.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I found the book very interesting and it kept my interest from beginning to end.  I couldn't put it down.  King is a great writer even if you don't like his subject.  I liked the subject because it brought back so many memories of that time in America, that was my youth.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|it is what is expected to do, and what it says it does, it does get well with the way you talk
B0056M7FCS|4.0|Its sad to see Rhapsody of Fire to split up but this album is a good way to go out. Stronger than the previous album and LP. The finale track (19minutes long) makes the entire album worth the price, its masterful and may very well be the last of this type of song we may ever get, finally finishing hte journey started years ago with Symphony of the Enchanted Lands 2 (the Dark Secret). Listen to it, its Rhapsody at its best, whether you like it or not.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This app has do many games to choose from as the name suggests. Most of the games I've played or unlocked are fun but there is the exception -- either a slow-moving game or a bad graphics/response game. I usually have fun here though. Only critical downfall for me is that the locked games are way way WAY too much &quot;money&quot; to spend.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great read that opens your eyes to the world of computers and technology. Great book for managers who would like to learn what it takes to become a great leader.
1401322786|5.0|Mitch Albom does not let down his readers in his latest novel The Time Keeper. Like many of his other books- this novel gives the reader a sense of self-reflection and when you finish reading it you also feel a sense of peace. The characters are very realistic and the entire story line is creative and believable. Another great Mitch book! Can't wait until the next one!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I am so obsessed with this show and so glad Amazon carried this online so I could get up to speed before season 5 starts tomorrow! I love Jax and the gang and can't wait to see what happens next. Season 4 was great, though I hope Jax grows his hair out again  ;)
B003XCVQ3C|2.0|Worked initially, but often had to plug and unplug the HDMI cable multiple times until my iMac sensed the TV signal. Often, audio would not come through. After 10 months, it would work only 1 in 10 times I tried, again without audio. Went with this replacement: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025V2VO0/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00
0756405890|5.0|After being disappointed the last few times I picked up a book by a new author, I was delighted to run across this gem of a novel. Narrated in medias res by the hero himself, the author focuses on the tragic past of Kvothe the Bloodless. While the flashback is the central part of the story, this is very cleverly interspersed with action happening in the \\"present\\" as the narration is being told. While this could make the story disjointed if done by a less skilled author, it is used very effectively to generate tension and keep the reader guessing: how did the events in the story lead up to the present? Sometimes the answer is revealed, sometimes dangled just out of reach. In that respect, the story has all of the tension of a good mystery novel, but in a fantasy setting.<br /><br />I'm very much looking forward to the rest of the series.
B007OV9EYG|5.0|My family loved this movie, had such a great time watching in 3D. Great movie, for all ages and great message. Instant classic.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was an entertaining, juicy, thriller. I enjoyed reading this book. I recommend it for a day where you want to curl up and read something just for the sake of reading a story. It's two parts, the first covers the disappearance of a house-wife in a Midwestern town. The book switch back and forth between first person narratives from the point of view of the husband and the wife.
0887431453|5.0|I bought this for my 3yr old daughter. She loves it! The pages have fun colors and designs. The directions are easy to follow. I even used a sheet protector on some of the pages and let my daughter use a dry-erase marker. That way we could re-use some of the pages over and over. I am very happy with this product.
B000W1TJWC|5.0|I was introduced to Rush with their album Vapor Trails, followed promptly by Chronicles, which was my first exposure to 'A Farewell To Kings'. It wasn't until recently that I actually bought it, though. I'll be honest, the radio friendly 'A Farewell to Kings' and 'Closer to the Heart' are classics and wonderful by all means, but 'Xanadu' and 'Cygnus X-1' completely overpower them in terms of power and length. And in spite of this, 'Cinderella Man' and 'Madrigal' are both listening to. To those who are new to Rush: if you are going to listen to the whole album, quickly follow it up with Hemispheres to continue the effect 'Cygnus X-1' has. The closing track on AFTK and the opening track on Hemispheres are part of a duology that take listening to once or twice to fully understand if you haven't read the lyrics (or know them by heart). Make no mistake, this is the Rush everyone should know.
B000001EUP|5.0|Although their next album Love At First Sting, is credited as being their breakthrough album, it was Blackout that saw the first major single success with No One Like You. An instant classic, the song has become a AOR staple since its first charting over 30 years ago. This was not the only gem on the record. The title track featured some blistering guitar work from the twin guitar assault of Rudolf Schenker/Matthias Jabs. Moreover, the album had China White, and Dynamite, which also became favorites for die-hard Scorps fans. Dieter Dierks returned to produce, and all of the bands collaberations with him saw their highest degree of commercial success. This album made a major impact in the States, and the Scorpions found a new home to play their great and inspiring music. At home in Germany the band remains the largest selling band in German music history both at home and abroad, selling over 100 million albums worldwide.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|I bet that al-Zawahiri is investing in a telescope or some powerful lenses to monitor if he can spot a drone above his hiding place. This book does not says very much but since it comes from an ex seals it confirm technics and methods that many suspected to be used by US navy. This book reveals how seals conduct their assaults in previously unconfirmed details that should stay vague for the general public. Here are some:<br /><br />1)The seals prefer moonless pitch dark nights<br />2)They use night visions with invisible rasers invisible to the naked eye<br />3)They use attack dogs<br />4)They prefer to attack using two team: one from the roof top and the other from the floor<br />5)They use drones planes to watch their targets days before assaulting
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Dark is an absolutely amazing book! I read the whole book in one day! I would recommend the whole series to anyone who would ask!!
098555780X|5.0|I purchased this for my 12 year old son who is a Boy Scout and into knot tying.  He was able to make a 3-lead 4-bight Turk's Head (pg. 10-12) quite easily.  Of course he will need to keep practicing to get them perfectly round like the book, but I must say his first attempt at it looked pretty good.  This book is perfect for beginners because the author takes you step-by-step through each project using large colored photos with written directions directly below each step.  I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in knot tying who wants to make useful items to use or give as gifts.
034580404X|5.0|I read the trilogy before I purchased my own set (very good). . .then purchased my own set. . . definitely will read again!

This has yet to happen.<br /><br />Ive baught the series that comes out before this book with great succsess and was hopefull for another. But, the lack of delivery<br />has ruined all my belife in amazon, posten and further shopping as a customer from Norway.<br /><br />I will not acsept this shipping as a natural delay (delivered in Oslo 7.september and still not shipped to destination town Tromso).<br />I will refuse to negotiate with a handler like Posten/Bring as their handling with me as a customer has been under<br />serious critisim earlier and continues to show as not a quality service.<br /><br />This delay has ment my girl never got her proper birthday present and that i will not (unless changed handler i Norway) buy from<br />Amazon again. This is not Amasons fault i understand. But, again Bring/Posten will not be my preferd shipping in the future and<br />my international handlings/buys will be with dealer able to provide other means of transport.<br /><br />I ask that Amazon and Bring sit down and show why in the year 2012 (mail from Norways capitol need more then 1-2days) when<br />what ive payed for is within 1-4days.<br /><br />In short forget me as customer if bring/posten.no is involved.<br />all the best from north norway
034580404X|2.0|I hope everyone knows by now that this started as \\"Twilight\\" fanfiction. When it was \\"Masters of the Universe\\" it was alright, you knew the real story about all the characters, so this was a different take on Edward's & Bella's world.<br /><br />\\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" being published is a joke. The way this book is written is the same exact version of MOTU, the grammatical errors included. The sex scenes are laughable, Ana is nerve wrecking with the lip biting, and OMG my husband is so hot, her inner goddess, the excessive use of Holy crap, cow etc..., why me I'm so not beautiful,and her multiple orgasms. I can't forget about the excessive emails, which takes up quite a few pages in the books. I didn't buy any of the books, borrowed them from a coworker I laughed all the way through the trilogy. I didn't really need to read the first and second book because as I mentioned before MOTU is the same as FSOG.<br /><br />Some people are mentioning there is no character growth or really no background of the characters, yes there is but you have to read the Twilight Saga or watch the films, or look them up online. The thing that I don't like about this whole FSOG is that the so call author ripped off someone else's hard work. A coworker of mine who is a huge fan of FSOG, mentioned that James is supposed to be writing a story from Christian pov and she wondered when James will write that. I told her when and if Stephenie Meyer ever decide to go back to finish her story about Edward. She looked at me funny, I laughed and walked off.<br /><br />If you like to escape from the real world for a while and you want something that's silly , then by all means read it. If you're looking for excitement, passion, a great plot and twist,and witty banter then FSOG isn't it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game has had me playing it in my spare time for the last couple of weeks. Wish i had more spate time!
1439102430|3.0|I agree with what people are saying about this not being her best work and I'm normally a huge fan and get the books as soon as they come out. I'd recommend actually reading this as opposed to listening as an audiobook because you can't skim over the ridiculously long explanations about seriously boring subject matter. I just don't get that, is it to fill the book up or sound really smart? Either way its extremely annoying. Usually the authors I read assume the reader is intelligent and if they don't know about a subject they'll educate themselves, which I actually enjoy doing, researching myself IF I want to. Only 30 minutes left, and as someone else has said, (SPOILER, unless you've read her books) Tempe has predictably gotten herself captured, ugh! For someone supposedly smart, she's so dumb.
B008XG1X18|5.0|the site is amazing.  the app is easy to use. I love all the features and the clean, concise look.  I'd recommend it to everyone.
B001PJRAUS|3.0|It's watchable, lightweight entertainment.  Some fun parts, but the ending seemed like something slapped on to wrap things up.  Lead female character is inept and crass and actress is just wrong for this role. Or perhaps the character is just wrong for this story, which doesn't seem to give women much credit.  Character isn't remotely convincing as someone who has read P&P but perhaps merely watched movie versions.  The only bright woman in this story is the one who wisely escapes most of it.  Messed up on some of the details of the period which would have helped to make it believable but perhaps only Austen fans will notice. Don't expect Austen style wit and subtlety--this is like a period situation comedy. Three stars is a fair rating for this.
B007TML4EI|5.0|I am happy to report that this is a entertaining and intelligent game! What makes this the best for me is to hear my 7 year old having a ball giggling while melvin falls apart and puffing his chest out when he's built a structure to save him...worth three stars in the game! Great job developers!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game is fun and challanges you at the same time.  You also have options on how to play the game.  I enjoy playing solitaire it is relaxing.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was a fantasic story line. Actually told of the life of a young girl dealing with a very difficult life. I know it's fiction but they did a great job. Can't wait for the other movies to come out. I have read all three books. At the end of this movie, I kept waiting for the rest of the story. This movie wasn't just for the young people either. I am a 64 yr old and enjoyed it very much.

0345803485|2.0|When I first heard about this book, I thought it would be an interesting read, but didn't get around to it until last week. With all the hype, I was expecting a lot more depth, character development and, well simply a plot would have been good, not just sex. The male character is a drop dead gorgeous, a genius billionaire with no social skills and the woman doesn't know anything except replying with smart remarks that make the man want to punish her (in a sexual way of course). I was totally disappointed with that theme which unfortunately ran through the entire book, especially because it was written by a woman. Come on, we are in the 21st century where there are millions of professional, intelligent, more than competent women who want to be portrayed as such, and not little girls who are at the mercy of the sexual exploits of men. Why is this a best seller? I think we as strong, intelligent women can do a lot better than that! Not worth your time or energy.

1455502758|4.0|Without even looking at the blurbs on the book jacket of this slender volume, one might guess at some of the adjectives that appear, words like \\"poignant,\\" \\"courageous,\\" inspiring.\\" These are words that the living invariably apply to obituaries and to published accounts of a terminal disease. Such words would no doubt make Christopher Hitchens laugh. One of the best parts of Mortality is when he mocks the ubiquitous term \\"battle\\" as applied to cancer.<br /><br />And one might guess that reviewers will call Mortality \\"lucid,\\" \\"eloquent,\\" and \\"witty.\\" Well sure. That kind of writing is what made Hitchens so compulsively readable.<br /><br />Mortality is not, however, a personal account of Hitchens's last days. It is not, thank goodness, a memoir. Instead, the book is the story of how the public man known to his friends and his readers as \\"Hitch\\" thinks about the disease that will end his life. The private man, the husband, father, and friend, is hidden away, and that is how it should be.<br /><br />I have an adjective for this book. It is sad.<br /><br />But there is joy to be had in opening any of Hitchens's other books. Don't let this little tombstone of a book be your introduction to his writing. Give the man an afterlife.<br /><br />M. Feldman

0307943194|3.0|I love John Grisham books and have read most of them.  Sadly, this one is the most boring of them all.  And then I get to the description in chapter of the echocardiogram carried out on the Krayoxx survivors and the description of the effect on the heart valves - here he really gets his pants in a twist.  A decrease in mitral regurgitation would be an incredible benefit for any drug and certainly not an unwanted one!  There are no 'seals around the aortic valve'!  'The echocardiogram measured aortic sufficiency and a decrease of thirty percent was great news for the lawyers' - not sure what he is getting at here - I guess it sounds good and unless you are very familiar with echocardiograms, the results obtained and the terminology used it all sounds like its correct.<br />Could it be the same with all the legal terminology and procedures?  I have no experience in that field and am assuming (hoping) that he is correct in what he has written there, but now I'm no longer sure.<br />This does take away from the book as it decreases my belief in him as a writer who knows his subject.

B000RIWAVW|5.0|As a self-proclaimed connoisseur of horror, I believe that Halloween is perhaps the most chilling and spine-tingling post-Psycho horror film. To this day, no imagery from film within the horrific arts resonates with me as lastingly and gruesomely as the scene wherein Jamie Lee is pacing, assuming she's safe within the house, and Michael creeps out from the darkness of the ever-so brilliantly, enigmatically utilized shadows for a scare to last decades, if not centuries. Above all else, Halloween deserves a top spot on the list of films to watch in the dark alone.<br />That is, of course, if you don't ever plan to sleep soundly again.
0143058592|4.0|I couldn't wait to start this book and while overall, the glimpse into this secret world of the Beatles at EMI is significant, I am disappointed with Mr. Emerick's assessment of George Harrison. He dismisses Harrison as a light weight because, after several takes he couldn't nail a couple of the solos, especially a Hard Days Night! Yet he gives McCartney glowing accolades for sitting in the studio until dawn doing take after take for his bass parts and describing that as his quest for perfection! In recent years I have installed a modest studio in my home and enjoy recording some of the music I used to play when I was in a band in the 1960s, including a lot of Beatles music. I practice for days to get something right but no matter how many times I practice the piece, when I hit the record button, it changes everything and I end up doing 15 or 20 takes to get it right. So I can certainly empathize with Harrison in that regard. While Harrison may not have impressed Mr. Emerick in the studio, he was a great live performer and had no problem nailing two difficult live solos on 'All My Loving' and 'Till There was You' on the Ed Sullivan Show!  If you have any doubts, get the Complete Beatles book and try them! [[ASIN:0793518326 The Beatles - Complete Scores]] He made it look easy and when a musician makes it look easy he is working very, very hard!  Mr. Emerick makes continued referneces to the fact that Harrison was constantly over shadowed by Lennon and McCartney. This may be true in later years, but in the early years it was Harrison's guitar embellishments and solos and his third voice - This Boy and All My Lovin' - that gave the Beatles the unique sound that so excited the world.  There's no mention of that in his book. While I never understood Harrison's fascination with Indian music, I still respect it from an artistic point of view. He remains my favorite Beatle.

B004ZBFRTY|5.0|This movie......words can't even describe how good it is. No movie I have ever seen (except maybe \\"2001: A space Odyssey\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\") even touches this film. I'm not even going to go into detail. The tenth anniversary edition is awesome, the movie is awesome. Just get it...trust me.
0393037010|4.0|I had seen the movie but not read the book.  It was very good. Well written and suspenseful.<br />I plan on purchasing more of the series. I have become a Patrick O Brian fan.

I bought a powered usb hub and just plug all 6 of my leds strips into that so I can save the usb slots on my computer. By placing them behind the monitor, it helps your eyes stay adjusted and allows you to sit at the desktop for a longer period of time without getting fatigued.

0345803485|1.0|Due to all of the hype, I kept reading this book hoping to get to the \\"good part.\\"  Should have ditched it. This story is so degrading to women.  No woman should ever allow a man to treat her in the manner that Christian Gray does.  Let's do a favor to our younger and less experienced sisters, daughters and girlfriends and boycott this book series.

I.e. exiting.  but if spend a little time trying to figure it out it is really fun.  you don't have to spend real money in it unless you really want to.  if you just have patience u can accomplish the goals by playing and earning coins and acorns.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was hesitant about reading these books since I don't normally jump on the bandwagon when new raves come out.  However, my son wanted me to watch the movie with him and I wanted to read the book first, so I broke down and bought the entire trilogy.<br /><br />I'm glad I did.<br /><br />From the very beginning, I became wrapped up in the story line and had a hard time putting the book down.  I zipped through the first two books because I simply couldn't get enough of them.  As I was reading the third book, I forced myself to slow down only because I didn't want it to end.<br /><br />I will definitely read another book from this author to see if this trilogy was a fluke, or if she has become my new favorite.
B0095R64AO|1.0|The story line could have been entertaining, but the movie itself was gross.  Too many references to disgusting behavior, etc.  The acting was sub-par.  While I think Emily Blunt is a good actress, this movie was not worth the time or the $$.  Don't waste your time.
0061122416|3.0|\\"The Alchemist\\" written by author Paulo Coelho demonstrates improbable but yet inspiring text, this shows that a novel can have more than just one sole meaning, this is important because us readers have more than one opinion on what we do in life.  For example it was a little hard to comprehend that Santiago who is the main character in this novel can magically turn himself into wind in front of the tribal leaders.  It is impossible for the human body to change forms as described in the fable.  Moving onto the subject of the books grammar was not that impressive either.  The writing style was moderate to low throughout the story.  Maybe it was just the way it was translated however, it lacked detail and was sometimes a little cliche in some parts.  The ending was satisfying, with a little humor mixed in as well.<br /><br />  Contrary I thought that the author filled this novel with lots of little motivations.  For example, listening to your heart and by doing that you can never make a wrong decision like in the book when Santiago said goodbye to the crystal shop merchant in search of his treasure.  Sure it was a tough decision at the moment but it benefited him in the long run.  Secondly, people's opinions should not matter to you unless they have experience to prove why they think that way about you.  Lastly, people were sent to this planet for a reason and like the book stated, you can achieve that reason by carrying out your personal legend.<br /><br />  With all of that being said, I would give this book 3 stars and would recommend this book to a friend for a quick read and not something to ponder and examine closely.  I thought this book was not the best however not the worst.  It had its pros and cons just like other books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a very well written book that young adults and adults alike will enjoy. The topic is hard to think about, but that is the point. This book really makes you stop and think about why we do the things we do and that we need to think decisions through as they can affect the future as well as the present. Suzanne Collins writes in such a way that it is very hard to put the book down once you have begun!
B004TI5N38|5.0|I never was much of a reader. Always had a hard time getting past the first chapter. I loved this book. i read it while we were on vacation and couldn't seem to put it down.

B008PE9GSA|5.0|Too many fanz seem to want the Top to return to the band they were 30 and 40 years ago. I like old ZZ Top, and I like new ZZ Top. La Futura is another reinterpretation of the blues and boogie, and of ZZ Top itself. A unique blend of hip hoppy/arena rock/southern rock Blues all deliberately yet effortlessly stylized. Gritty. Humorous, frivolous, yet dark and mysterious. Cryptic. It captures the mystique of the blues in a way I don't fully understand but can wholly appreciate. There's always a new twist in the ZZ Top saga....and they don't sell out or fall short in their quest to venture to unfamiliar, yet bizarrely recognizable, territory, You don't hear this on mainstream radio too often, because mainstream radio basically sticks on ball-sack. La Futura is a blues triumph, and their best, probably, since Eliminator. They're not running low on gas yet. Chugging a long. A wonderful, menacing beast that can't be stopped.<br /><br />Billy Gibbons' best vocals on a ZZ Top album.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|[[ASIN:B0084IG7KC The Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]<br />Received the dvd promptly. However at first viewing the dvd stopped about 1/3 through movie. Immediately contacted Amazon with problem. Replacement disc set was shipped that same hour and arrived in 2 days. I returned the original set. New disc worked perfectly with great picture and sound.I enjoyed the movie as much as I did in the theater. I would give both the dvd set and Amazon 5 stars for performance. Sometimes defects do occur but when the defect is handled as promptly and this was it should not reflect badly on the supplier. I knew the movie would be great since I had seen it at the movie but this was my first instance of receiving a defective item through Amazon. Great handling of situation.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I read the book first, could not put it down!!!!  The movie was every bit as good.  Only wish that it was all three books, but the movies are coming.  Great actors, great story!!!  I recommend the book and the movie!  :)

B003K16P50|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book for a number of reasons.  I enjoyed the slightly different way to tell a story - which was through emails, letters, Hansard reports etc.  It is a wonderful flight of fancy, yet becomes very believable.  The characters come to life,and are all nicely portrayed as very different personalities, with different ways of responding to situations. They relate to each other (or not), learn and grow and change through the novel.  Places are clearly and nicely described too.  The prose flows easily, and it was always an inviting read.. in fact, I finished it in a few days.
0553801473|1.0|You know a book is bad when most of  it describes food,people relieving themselves, deviant sex and a ruler who only wants to bed a secondary character nobody cares about.As other reviewers have noted a lot of the book is focused on characters moving from point A to point B with detailed descriptions of the scenery .That's unfortunate considering how these journeys were dealt with in the first three books. In Book 1 , Tyrion travels to winterfell  , then goes to the wall , then back to king's landing ,get's captured and goes to the vale.He later escapes , fights robb stark's armies and goes off to king's landing by the end of the book .We were introduced to locations and characters that would play a big role in later books and my interest never waned since the character never overstayed his welcome in any one location . Oh and  the plot advanced as well , we learned more about tyrion , his past , his family history and the story was better for it , here we learn that tyrion ponders on the question that haunts most philosophers , \\" Where do whores go\\", and that's it . At the start of this book , we are led to believe that he will join dany in mereen ,but he never even reaches her after traveling for a THOUSAND pages. This was an author who was bold enough to kill Ned Stark. Now he brings characters back from the dead in every other chapter . Sure it wasn't mentioned explicitly that theon died in book 2 , but we assumed he did and were glad that he got his comeuppance.Now he is back , a broken man with fewer toes and teeth rhyming like it's nobody's business.<br />Dany was supposed to be a badass .She is the mother of dragons who she brought to life by burning a witch alive and walking  into the fire. Now all she wants to do is bump ugly with Dario while her kingdom falls to bits , her dragons wild and uncontrollable ,and with no plans to go to king' landing anytime soon. By the way the title of the book is DANCE WITH DRAGONS . Where  are they? As mentioned above , Dany finds it difficult to control her dragons and so decides to lock them up in the beginning of the book . Near the end, yes a thousand pages later they show up again and before we can read more about them , the story ends . Whether they dance or not is left to the reader's imagination.<br />I am still not sure if winter has officially arrived in  westeros but am sure we will learn about it in the next book which might never be released . The others , the wights , Brienne's  one word , all the good bits which i thought i would i read about are not here. The sad thing is , I got into the fantasy genre after reading the first four books. I liked the fourth book as well although Brienne's chapters were dull. Now the author releases this bilge.<br />The FIVE star reviews are bogus . Do not get yourselves fooled into buying this by reading those reviews. Start with the three star reviews and work yourself down from there , and if you are still interested , sure go for it . As longtime readers will attest this series has lost it's way and it's possible that it will never regain it's previous peaks.ny finds it difficult to control her dragons and so decides to lock them up in the beginning of the book .

B008XG1X18|4.0|So I am totally addicted to Pinterest and I use a Kindle Fire because my brother is almost always on our desktop. But to try to use the web browser on the Kindle to veiw Pin is practically impossible. My Kindle would freeze up, take forever to load, and it was very hard to see anything. This app is awesome. I gave it four stars because it can have a hard time connecting but that could just be my internet. But if you move it to where it gets better connection to start up it doesnt have a problem after that.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I recently became wheat intolerant. Have learned a lot about it in 3 months of trial and error. When I heard about the book I thought why not. Best purchase I have made in years.

B006GHA9QQ|1.0|THIS IS TERRIBLE!  I can't believe it's by the same person who wrote Phantom of the Opera, Les Mis, Cats, ect.  The music is not memorable, the lyrics are sophomoric and and the plot line is complete crap.  It changes history as presented in Phantom, and characters' personalities are completely altered to make it work.  The Phantom flees to Coney Island to start up a circus/freak-show after the events in Paris.  Madame Giry and her daughter Meg follow him.  Meg becomes a burlesque dancer and obsessed with the Phantom.  Madame Giry wants to hook them up.  Christine, Raul and their son get drawn to Cony Island to open a new opera house, but the Phantom convinces Christine to sing at his show instead.  Raul is now a mean, gambling drunk and Christine is now in love with the Phantom, who has changed from the pitiful, screwed-up, dangerous Genius of the original musical to someone who plays by the rules and is mild, self-sacrificing, and likes clowns and bad Carnival music.  Oh, and by the way, it is revealed that Christine slept with him the night before her wedding and Gustave is actually the Phantoms son!  Everything about this musical is SO, SO BAD.  Spare yourself the pain of watching it.

However, it is unfortunate that Marlo Morgan didn't take the time to research the indigenous people of Australia. They are nothing like our Native Americans. I researched the author, and the controversy surrounding her is more enticing than the book!

B007IXWKUK|3.0|These books are not well written but are a wonderful fun books to read. Of course the sex is awsome in the books. I do not read often and when I do it must really interest me to keep me going. Writer gets hung on a word. a verb that describes something and uses it for at least a chapter over and over again and then moves on to another verb. That part really irritates me. If I were to do it over again... I would get these from the library so I didn't have to pay for them...
0307387178|5.0|I am not a misanthrope, but I don't like being in big cities. I majored in Corporate Communication, but I despise the corporate world. Thus, upon being handed my degree, I was a bit conflicted as to what my path in life may be.<br /><br />This book changed that.<br /><br />It tells a tale of a man who is unafraid of the unknown. He brazenly faces new challenges with aplomb and good nature, and no matter his predicament, he can see the positives in everything. Oh, how I envy Chris McCandless. He lives the tired cliche of \\"live for the moment\\", and yet he escapes its pigeonhole. Chris is a rapidly dwindling flame, a last stand against the homogenized iLife of civilized humanity. John Krakauer has written a sublime and poignant tribute to a \\"reverse-pioneer\\", someone who lived FOR life, and not for life's perks. This book did indeed turn my outlook upside-down. Perhaps, it's left me questioning my long-held preconceptions of what I'm meant to do in this lifetime. I couldn't tell you what I believe now, as I have yet to discover it.<br /><br />But what I can tell you is this: never settle, never keep working a job you hate, and kill boredom with personal progress. I can't tell you what I'll be doing ten years from now, but thanks to Krakauer's writing prowess and McCandless' (aka Supertramp's) story, I have a clearer path now than I ever had before. Buy this book and discover your inner pioneer and explorer. \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" leads by example.

B005II7188|5.0|BLITZ is very much worth watching. Yes, it is another exploration of what makes a good and bad cop, but this time the story is so well told and the actors are so convincing that once this film has 'blitzed' by the viewer's eyes, watching it again will be an even more positive experience. Based on the novel by Ken Bruen and adapted for the screen with crackling dialogue by Nathan Parker, the story of the film is not so much one that is tough to follow - that's not the point - it is how the characters deploy themselves that makes it explode. Elliot Lester shows his mettle as an action director who understands character development and allows it to develop very naturally.<br /><br />Detective Sargeant Tom Brant (Jason Statham) has his own way of catching and punishing criminals and his quick temper and disgust for perpetrators tends to make him act quickly and violently, a trait that gets him into trouble with his superiors. A serial cop killer who goes by the name of Blitz or Barry Weiss (Aidan Gillen) is out to kill as many cops as possible because of the way Brant treated him in a pool hall brawl a few years ago. One of the cops - Chief Inspector James Roberts (Mark Rylance) is victimized and put on leave and is replaced by gay cop Porter Nash (Paddy Considine). Initially at odds because of Brant's curt put down of Nash's lifestyle, the two finally join hands, discover why they are motivated to be violent from a very similar background, and the two set out to capture the Blitz. The media gets involved with reporter Dunlop (David Morrisey) from a tip from the serial killer who really is after fame. A sidebar involves a prior undercover cop in the drug world, WPC Elizabeth Falls (Zawe Ashton), who has her own personal bruises and joins in the chase for the killer with the apparent aid of DI Craig Stokes (Luke Evans). But just when these disparate cops think they have the serial killer Blitz under control, Blitz outsmarts them again until the well-staged suspenseful chase brings the film to a surprising close.<br /><br />BLITZ is a yarn well told and well acted: Statham and Considine have great screen chemistry and the cameo roles are all molded to perfection by a very strong British cast. Very much worth seeing at least once...Grady Harp, September 12ase brings the film to a surprising close.<br /><br />BLITZ is a yarn well told and well acted: Statham and Considine have great screen chemistry and the cameo roles are all molded to perfection by a very strong British cast.

B0034G4P4O|5.0|They did a great job creating this Tintin movie. It captures the spirit of the comic strips: the characters are the same, it's exciting, it is also comical (there are the same type of fun scenes that were in the comic strips, although perhaps not the same ones).

0525953728|5.0|I'm going to have to change my stance on nonfiction.  I'm a very strict \\"fictionarian\\" and it takes a lot to pull me from my comfort zone.  They hype on this book did a lot to help push me over to the dark side, but the main reason was; I wanted to hear a true narrative from a real-life SEAL.  I read books by Brad Thor, Vince Flynn, Ted Bell, and Brad Taylor (to name a few) and enjoy their books immensely!  However, while their books are based on true accounts and true warrior-heroes, they aren't the real true stories.  THIS is a true story and there was no way I wasn't going to read it.  And damn, what a story!<br /><br />Let me be clear about one point from the start: I don't think \\"Owen\\" should have told this story.  My mantra is simple: \\"serve and shut the hell up\\".  Soldiers are people like the rest of us and are prone to the same mistakes we all trip over.  Sometimes we talk too damn much, hell I know I do.  But to write a book and go through the process of telling us about one of the most important missions in the history of the U.S.? Something about that doesn't sit right.  Of course in the paradoxical world in which live, I was the first one in line to buy (download) and if I had ANY conviction at all, I wouldn't be supporting the author by doing so.  Despite my feelings about \\"Owen\\" running off at the mouth, I enjoyed every minute of this book and I don't feel the least bit guilty in saying so.<br /><br />'No Easy Day' is a VERY good book!  Any story that gives you a \\"fly on the wall\\" perspective into an operation that we only hear (and only in snippets) about is a thrill.  This is extremely well written and not choppy or staccato like someone just trying to rush out a tale.  `No Easy Day' starts out with a note from the author covering his bases.  \\"This books won't tell you about any secrets\\", \\"this book has changed the names of all involved\\", \\"this book has been checked by a special attorney\\", \\"this book was endorsed by Ronald Reagan in a s&eacute;ance\\"... whatever.  If you have the stones to put out a story like this then don't bother with covering your butt.  We get it and we don't need it OK?  And the people that need an explanation won't believe anything you have to say anyway.<br /><br />After those few pages we get what we came for: the mission.  \\"Owen\\" starts off with the team being on a Blackhawk one minute out from the compound on the mission to kill Osama.  This story switches from the past to the present but not in a confusing way.  In the first part of the book we get a taste of what drove him to want to be a SEAL and the absolute agonizing vetting process these guys go through.  Physical doesn't even begin to describe it.  Grueling doesn't either.  Matter of fact; just throw out every adjective that comes to mind because you won't even come close.  These guys are the guys that Alpha Males want to be.<br /><br />We learn about SEAL training, we read about \\"Owen's\\" first missions, and we also learn about two million and one military acronyms. You wanna see what Sesame Street would be like if everyone was on crack?!  Good heavens! We are taken on missions and we see, in a small way, how SEALs run their operations, and it was a good buildup to why I wanted to read this book in the first place. \\"Owen\\" mentions more than a few times about how Hollywood gets these types of movies wrong all the time. Reading about the missions in this book I can see that. One of the best parts of this book was the mission was when they went after the pirates that kidnapped one of our. Remember that?  I do.  The precision in which they did their job is chilling. And even though I had nothing to do with that mission, I was proud. Borderline giddy.<br /><br />As I alluded to earlier, this book goes from past to present and it does so because \\"Owen\\" is setting the foundation for the big story. Bin Laden.  As \\"Owen\\" says in this book, \\"this is the mission they all dream about\\". Not necessarily Bin Laden, but one with implications that will be felt for years, even decades later. After years of tracking and misinformation, the U.S. gets lucky with a bit of Intel and that little bit turns out to be the golden ticket.  Enter the SEALs and start the death timer for that animal. In the earlier missions we didn't hear much about the political mumbo-jumbo that must be dealt with. With the hunting of this animal the American PC machine is in full useless bloom!  It's so bad the SEALs didn't even believe they would get the green light.<br /><br />One of the most sickening parts of this story was when they were planning the mission with the VIP's, and in the room with these elite, professional, war tested and war proven soldiers... was a lawyer. A freaking lawyer!!  This is a quote from this idiot: \\"If he doesn't pose a threat you will detain him\\". WHAT?!  I was literally yelling at the book, \\"this is Bin Laden you moron!!  What do you mean \\"if he poses a threat\\"?  \\"This guy's very life is a threat!!\\" Typical Washington BS.<br /><br />Stupid comments like that as well as other things done for the betterment of politics, rather than for the betterment of the mission was why the SEALs didn't believe Washington had the courage to say \\"go\\".  In this case they did and the SEALs did what they do best. This part of the book just flew by because I wanted to know what happened. OK fine, I already knew what happened, but I wanted... more.  Make time for this part of the book folks... you'll need it. I reread and highlighted more in the last 1/4 than I did the entire 3/4 of this book. Parts of this mission have their own chapter and the most arresting one was the one entitled \\"Geronimo\\". All of the (so called) controversy is worth it when you read this section. That's all I'm going to say about that.<br /><br />Because I usually read the fictional stories I had to tell myself that this was a true and these were real people.  Jen was a woman who really stood out.  She had a small part in this book but a big part in our real world.  And I know that we are talking SEAL this and SEAL that, but \\"Owen\\" paints a very detailed picture about the number of people working behind the scene. Of course SEALs usually work behind the scenes (ouch)... I've never served even as I was/am surrounded by people who do. As a layman I didn't see any secrets being given up. True I wouldn't know what to look for, but I do admit that the bigger issue is he spoke, not what he spoke about.<br /><br />Another big issue being bantered around was what \\"Owen\\" said about President Obama. Ummmmm... I finished the book and didn't see any disparaging remarks about our President. There are some remarks that were made by teammates that I'm sure were private (again, shut up \\"Owen\\") but I didn't see anything disrespectful at all. The only thing I saw were soldiers being soldiers. Soldiers, who were tired of politicians making laws from behind a desk while they put in the work. Tired of burying friends while they bury earmarks. Tired of fighting and detaining the same enemy every thirty days because they are very versed on our laws, and has taken to running and hiding under the constitution of a country they profess to hate and actively seek to destroy.  Yeah I see the frustration there and some things will be said in the heat of the moment.<br /><br />That being said, no soldier should publicly say anything negative about the Commander in Chief.  Privately... go at it.  (Holy crap, am I really at three pages for this review?)  OK I better wrap this up.  Look, bottom line; if you are looking for a quick very good non-fiction read then I highly, highly recommend this book.  Ignore the hype, and to be fair, ignore the good AND bad hype.  This is a book that you will need to read personally to draw your own conclusions.  No matter your feeling on Mr. \\"Owen\\" and his yammering jaw, we can at least agree that the SEALs are an elite and extremely brave type of soldier that America is honored to have on her soil and who will forever be in debt to these men.eal world.

B006H5120E|3.0|As a 3D buff, I was first in line at the local cinema when Titanic 3D opened.  Unfortunately, the theater in which I viewed the movie had a weak DLP projection system, rendering the film dark, dull, and colorless.<br /><br />When my Blu-Ray arrived, I popped it into my LG BD670 and started watching it in 3D on my LG Cinema 3D surround setup. The video is ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!  Five times better than in the theater, the picture has gorgeous color, brilliantly sharp picture, and amazingly lifelike 3D. All I can say is, Roger Ebert is either blind or he watched the movie in a theater with a projection system as bad as the one I was in. Several of the scenes on-deck were like being there.<br /><br />On the other hand, I and my wife couldn't help noticing that the sound track, brilliant in its clarity and dynamic range, was out of sync with the characters lips in several scenes.  It wasn't BADLY out of sync, but easily bad enough to be noticeable.  Could it be my setup?  I've watched over 50 movies in 3D and never noticed a problem before with sound sync.<br /><br />Has anyone else noticed this??
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game! not like the original but still great. a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
B008XG1X18|4.0|As a self proclaimed pinterest addict i just love this ap!  And now I can browse and pin wherever I have my fire.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book picks up from part one so the reader feels like they never put the first part down. If you are reading out of sequence, you can still follow without difficulty and the storyline is still enjoyable.  I can't wait to get my hands on part 3.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Hubby is now reading the 3rd book, and he encouraged me to order \\"Hunger Games\\". The movie was excellently done, although I anticipated more blood and guts per his account of the book. This movie did not disappoint & we both were mesmerized at the clarity and beauty of BluRay. I want to watch it again, on some chilly night while munching on pretzels or such. IT WAS GREAT!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thought this was a great book with lots of interesting information on the training and lifestyle of the Special Forces. I think its awesome that proceeds of the book are also going to support charity. Great Job..
B0086449YA|4.0|I come to Privateering somewhat of a blank slate when it comes to Mark Knopfler, as my only real reference for his prior work is \\"Money For Nothing\\" over 25 years ago.  However, my curiosity was raised when I read about it on the product page a few weeks ago.  I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />Privateering seems like a rather ambitious project with 20 original songs spanning folk, rockabilly, and blues.  While I liked the majority of what I heard, I want to get my only criticism out of the way first.  Some of the blues songs have rather repetitive lyrics.  I know this is common for the genre, but Knopfler avoids it on the blues shuffles \\"I Used To Could\\" and \\"Today Is Okay\\".  It is on tracks like \\"Miss You Blues\\", \\"Go, Love\\", \\"Got To Have Something\\", and \\"Bluebird\\" that it was on display and bothered me.<br /><br />The folk songs fared much better in my book.  Some of them had elements that reminded me of the \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" opening of the Fellowship of the Ring.  How can hear a tin whistle and not think of Bilbo?  I think Knopfler wanted that whimsical mood on \\"Haul Away\\" where listeners hear \\"The morning brings, Lord, a fresh young breeze to fill out sails, to end the doldrums\\".  The other song where I found this was \\"Kingdom Of Gold\\", and the tin whistle takes listeners away to another place and time where the story of the song takes place.<br /><br />I also liked the rockabilly songs including \\"Corned Beef City\\" which seems like an ode to day laborers.  In addition, I liked how Knopfler used interesting structure in places such as \\"Blood And Water\\" which follows a chorus/verse/chorus/verse/chorus pattern.  This is inverted compared to what the radio-hit formula suggests.  The closing song \\"After The Beanstalk\\" is a honky tonk number that will appeal to O' Brother, Where Art Thou? fans.<br /><br />Overall, Privateering is a collection of songs that spans a number of styles and has a lot to like.  You don't need to be a long time die-hard Mark Knopfler fan to find something here to enjoy.  Give it a try.  I think you'll like what you find.<br /><br />Download this:  Kingdom Of Golddie-hard Mark Knopfler fan to find something here to enjoy.  Give it a try.

B0075LTOR2|5.0|I too was dissapointed when i seen they lost the DVD's. But after hearing this set i'm more than happy i ordered it. Couldn't be happier with the quality of recording. Great detail and seperation. Great job of mastering on this set.
B005FJ7DOM|5.0|wow - i was not expecting this to be good, let alone sooo good. wow. this moview has almost every situation i desire in a post apoc story. get this to keep it. a wonderful show.<br />[[ASIN:B000IZXR7U Mad Max]]
B00884GR0W|5.0|this is an awesome game and a good stand in for minecraft though there is no maltiplayer, it is still a really good game. I would recommend getting it if your looking for a minecraft type game.
B008BDZP30|5.0|I knew it would be good based on the unbridled enthusiasm displayed on Frank's face on the cover photo. It was not false advertising. This CD is really that good. Enjoyed listening to it repeatedly on road trip to New Jersey
B008XG1X18|5.0|great ideas.  great way to organize your ideas for the whole family.  would recommend this app to everyone.  its fun

0439023513|5.0|Love all the books I just finished them :) But now that I am done with them I feel as tho there is a hole in my soul I don't know what to do know lol You NEED to come out with more books like this maybe a spin off of Katniss & Peeta's children? Something :)  I loved all the books & the story they tell, & how war is not pretty and no one comes out unscathed. A realistic happy ending :)
B007P4LX64|5.0|The movie itself is perfect, the DVD quality is perfect...I'd watch this every day if I could. I'm hooked. Do yourself a favor: get this.
0525953728|5.0|Great book and very easy read.  I couldn't put it down and finished it in less than a day.  The first hand account of DevGru operations in general and the OBL mission, Truly left me wanting to shake the hand of all our military and thank them.  It is great to know that we have this level of dedicated personnel protecting the country.  I am not sure what all the fuss was by the government and news media as having served in the military in TS area I didn't see anything outright secret in the book.  Just a good first hand account.
1602830452|5.0|This is a \\"Full Cast\\" Radio Drama that BBC made during the late 1980s on through until 1998. And the actor that plays Watson changes hands a few times, but to me it is not noticable. It is of the highest quality that I have ever heard!<br />............<br />From an Historical stand point, the references to Opiates is accurate.  The doctors at that time - starting in the late 1800s - were just begining to discover that these types of \\"Miracle Drugs\\" were addictive.<br />............<br />Note To Parents: this product does have the occasional curse word, but not often. Also, some of the themes may need Parental Guidance ... and a few stories may be too scary for younger listeners who are under age.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I've never read any of the Hunger Games books, so how this compares I wouldn't know. But as a stand alone film it was good. I heard people compare this to a different book/film called Battle Royale, which I have seen and read the book. There are some similarities, but I'm not going to mention them, you should just watch this film and read BR.<br /><br />Anyway, this film was ok. A bit slow in the beginning, to help explain who Katnis is and her values. There's a good amount of drama tossed in, which would be obvious for the plot of the movie.<br /><br />There are definite moments that you notice there just isn't enough time in a 1 hour and 40-some minute movie to explain every single detail, like \\"Oh, how did he end up there?\\" Or \\"why was it so sad that she died?\\" ...things like that.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good movie for teenagers to watch, adults can get into it too. Not so much for smaller children. Only downside; this feels like it's going to be another Twilight or Harry Potter saga... Don't be surprised if they end up splitting the last book into 4 or five seperate movies ;-)
B007X10OLE|5.0|Smash is my absolute favorite television show. I love all of the original songs as well as the covers. Katharine McPhee and Megan Hilty are at the very best!
B006H5120E|5.0|We all know the story so my review is for the quality of the blu ray (image quality) and 3D.  The quality of the image is very impressive.  The colors are vivid, a lot of contrast, very clear picture.  It's hard to believe that this movie was converted from 2D to 3D because the 3D effect is one of the best I've ever seen.  There was no noticeable ghosting.  I had seen the 3D version of this movie in the theatre and thought it was good.  However, it is even more impressive on my 3D TV (47 inch LG).  The characters often appear to be with me in the room, they pop out of the screen.  There is a lot of depth throughout the movie, which is also visable in darker scenes.  The picture is amazing.  You get the feeling that you are in the movie...when the boat sinks, you feel as if you're part of the action.  I was very impressed with the quality of the 3D.  I would recommend this to anyone who owns a 3D TV...worth every penny!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|This is Maroon 5's best album yet! It has some very catchy, upbeat songs as well as some slower ballads. It is the perfect combination that portrays all of Maroon 5's strengths.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This show is excellent. It keeps on the edge of your chair wondering what's gonna happen next episode. I've gotten to a point where I hate buying movies because people always want to borrow then you get it back and in most cases it's been damaged. I have subscriptions to Hulu plus and Netflix and neither one has season four. When I was introduced to Amazon and seen season four I was sold.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|Ghost is a beautiful, touching love story that teaches you to believe and never give up. I cried during the entire movie either because the story was so sad or because I was laughing too hard. The cast a spectacular job!
B005VGUA5S|5.0|I saw Pink Martini in Sun Valley, ID this summer, at an outdoor concert.  Didn't know what to expect, as I had never heard of them, but LOVED every minute of their concert.<br />A Retrospective, will give you a really nice introduction to Pink Martini....  You'll be HOOKED!
B004X0Y8LU|4.0|After releasing their momentous album, Two Dancers, it would seem a bit of a struggle for the band to come back with the same rough \\"hooting and howling.\\" Yet, they came back with a softer, more sublte sound that remains equally pleasing. From the soothing vocals and to the beautifully written lyrics, this in my opinion is one of the best albums from 2011. One of my personal favorites, End Come Too Soon, perfectly wraps up this album with a balance of both grandeur and delicacy that continues to define Wild Beasts.
0345803485|1.0|All of your dumb friends will highly recommend this book. Don't be fooled. Unless you're a 14-year-old girl, with no concept of real sex, or have the IQ of a parakeet you will hate this book. It was painful to read. I forced myself to keep reading, hoping all these crazed women were right, but it never got better. It only got worse. Every time Anastasia (the name alone makes me want to throw up) mentioned her \\"inner goddess\\" or biting her damn lip, I'd groaned out loud. The writing was immature, cheesy and repetitive. The characters were not likable or believable. This book was truly terrible, and someone should tie up the author and give her a hard spanking for writing it.
1452110581|4.0|This is a very funny collection of delightful poems which reflect the true nature of our furry owners. The only criticism which I could make is that there are not enough. Perhaphs a second volume could appear in the future.
B007C9N4H8|2.0|I didn't like this movie much.  It was allegedly a kid's movie, which we showed it to my 4 year old.  Maybe it was too old for him, and too juvenile for my wife and I.  Stupid story line, bad acting.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love it the game is so realistic makes me think back to the floppy disk in elementary school.  I give it 5 stars without a doubt.
B002WY65UQ|5.0|One of my absolute fave British comedies.  Rupert Everett staring in two roles as brother and sister is phenomenal. If you are a lover of British cinema and looking for a good laugh, then look no further.

0525478817|5.0|The Big C, Carcinoma, Malignant Tumor, Cancer: the dreaded word no one wants to hear.  What family has not been touched by this medical disease in some form?

And once you radiate the lungs, you are on oxygen for the rest of your life.  Like Hazel Grace.<br /><br />Deep and raw are the best words I know how to describe this powerful story.  I dare anyone not to cry at some point. Both bittersweet and funny, you can guess how it will end.  So why read it?

B002XTXG1G|5.0|The movie arrived in a very timely manner and was in good condition upon arrival. It was a great way to see Tom Hardy at his best. All in all, good quality, great delivery, AMAZING FILM.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I've only watched eight of the 22 episodes but \\"Once Upon A Time\\" is my new favorite show! The stories are interesting and full of intrigue but not confusing or frustrating! It's fun to find all the nods to the Disney fairy tales and I love the way the series flows between the fairy tale world and modern day.  If you like fairy tales and haven't found anything to keep you tuning in since \\"Lost,\\" you'll love \\"Once Upon A Time!\\"
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I was a little hesitant to watch the movie because I had heard that it was not a great adaptation of the book, but I think they did a pretty good job hitting on the key parts from the novel.  Some of the action scenes seemed very forced but overall a good movie.
B00284G2JE|5.0|Matt Pike of course fronts High on Fire, the extremely brutal power trio that picks up where Motorhead leaves off into even heavier territory.  Before HOF, Pike played guitar with Sleep, a legend among stoner bands like Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age and Electric Wizard.  \\"Sleep's Holy Mountain\\" is a great album that recalls the old swing beats of early heavy rockers like Nazareth, truly one of the most underrated bands ever, of course, Black Sabbath and their own unique sound.  Matt Pike of course is the driving force again with this three piece, at once ultra heavy and spacey.  Even \\"Some Grass\\" features a banjo.  His lead work is brilliant as usual, and the title track is a stone cold classic.  Fans of High On Fire will not be disappointed with Sleep.  They also cover Sabbath's \\"Snowblind\\", and breathe new life into this classic cut.<br />  Sleep made two other albums, the first one almost impossible to find, and the other one of the more unique stoner albums, featuring one song \\"Dope Smoker\\" that lumbers along over an hour!  Yet it hypnotizes the listener and actually works.  Both albums are metal must haves.
0525953728|4.0|I don't have the finesse that other reviewers have, so let me just say the book lived up to its hype. I enjoyed reading about the team dynamic with SEAL's. I can't decide whether or not he should have written the book, because it does put lots of key details in one place. On the other hand, too many people have sacrificed too much to be fed a fake story about how it went down.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I didn´t expect that I liked Delirium so much. Love is a disease? I did know that, she will fall in love before surgery?, pretty obvious.<br /><br />However, I could not put it down. I lost sleep and work, it seemed that I had contracted the disease in the book.<br /><br />A fabulous book about the true meaning of love ... tears? almost
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Book 3 of 3 was better than the first 2, and the first two books were great.  Book three continues to be full of excitement and suspence.  My newly form book club is reading this book and we are having a hard time not discussing it before the book club meeting .  We hope EL James write a sequence soon.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Why I continue doing this to myself? I was really hoping that- at some point - this series shew some kind of plot, but again I was disappointed.<br /><br />I keep wondering why people went crazy for this book. If Christian Grey had been a truck driver instead of a millionaire, the book had had the same success?<br /><br />As in \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", it was like Edward Cullen  mixed with Vishous (Black Dagger Brotherhood) but without a plot.
B004LROUW2|1.0|This started as an interesting story. The character development gave a great visual  description. A chapter on each character and slowly linking each one to the other is a great wat  to hold the interest and develop the plot. The problem for me was the story became completly unbelievable and boring at the same time.  I love fantasy writing but this book just did not cut it. It dragged after 3/4 of reading, it was possible to skim pages and still get the plot. I could see also that a book 2 was been developed before the end. I am tired of books that have pages  of unnecessary descriptions just to give pages to read. I like a book that is complete in itself that maybe wants you to read book 2. I  feel this book not worth the money spent.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Edward Cullen from Twiligth meets Vishous from the Black Dagger Brotherhood, but without de \\"Vampire Mojo\\"<br /><br />I don´t get what is the big deal about this book. The writting, the charachters...nothing new and the plot...500 pages of nothing.<br /><br />I deeply respect the people who loves \\"Fifty Shades...\\", but I don´t understand why they love it so much.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I became a fan of science fiction when I read the \\"Dune\\" series  again and again.  I often despair of finding good science fiction that is not fantasy and is as engrossing as \\"Dune\\".  Wool has done it for me.  I have not read anything this good in a long time and can't wait for the next installment.  The story line and the emotional lives of the characters are engrossing.  While I can imagine how the silos came into existance there is still an air of mystery surrounding the culture that developed and how it will change -- or not -- depending on future events.  I think I will be reading \\"Wool\\" again and again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good game to have when you don't have access to wifi. It's addicting. I definitely recommend this game for card game lover's.

B008QDCZJ2|5.0|Everyone is over reacting, don't we always fall in love with everything PSB once it sets in, B sides included.  This record is very emotional and haunting...  ring any bells?  BEHAVIOUR anyone........ was just as upsetting to fans at first, now it's among many fans most cherished.  No this record prob won't top Behaviour but lets enjoy the CHILL side of the Boys once in a while friends. If you're a fan of the feel and pace of BEHAVIOUR you will LOVE this record in my opinion. The first two tracks Leaving and Invisible might be two of the best PSB tracks ever.... The last 3 tracks are great PSB, everything in between is still very good PSB and I love Ego Music. The one snooze maybe \\"Winner\\" I agree with others there.  Must fault Neil for WINNER because the instrumental is a very nice piece.  We're just not used to PSB vocals being so pretentious as this track.
B008K8U13K|4.0|This was a nice app: Although it was pretty expensive, it ran smoothly and had nice graphics.  My only complaint is it had zero cutsenes and hardly told the story.  If you you were not familiar with the series you could play the entire game,beat it and still not understand what a chaos emerald is or know who on earth is the guy with the mustache riding all of those machines.  Nice game, just needs some cutsenes.  I hear that the sequel has some though.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|Why is this not available as a Kindle book?  It seems others have downloaded it, but the option to buy as a kindle book is not available.
B00821OW8K|4.0|I will have to admit that it isn't the greatest show ever, but what captured me is the mood and atmosphere and environment of the idea for the show.  I love post apocalyptic / survival type movies and video games and I do enjoy this one.  I put it on the same level as the show Jericho, except maybe a bit better graphics.  The acting isn't horrible, but isn't great.  I don't really feel any strong connection with anyone person, although you do tend to hope for the character \\"PoPe\\".  It is almost as if his strive for some sort of redemption and some humanity takes over the other characters influence.  It isn't bad, I would watch more hoping for some twisted messages that they gave in the first season.

B0063IH60K|3.0|This is your standard &quot;computer solitaire&quot; game.Fun and convenient to play. This free version, of course, comes with ads. But now I'm getting ads in Spanish shoved in my face? I speak and hear English. I will seek my Solitaire entertainment elsewhere. Comprende?
B0042J6VUS|3.0|the phone holder works very well, it does the job I've bought it for. The tripod, paid $1 (with no expectations), is very bad: too light to hold any camera-phone, the extensions of the legs are too weak and can barely bear the weight of my Nokia N8. But I didn't have big expectations anyway. Perhaps I could have saved one dollar.
B008XG1X18|5.0|the only thing I don't like about Pinterest is how much time I spend on it! I love this app!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this web site. It's a virtual magazine file. Without all the torn pages. Great place to go to get ideas on ANYTHING.  Fashion, food, interiors, garden, book reviews you name it...it's on Pinterest. My spare time website. It's addictive.
B008602KQI|5.0|Has a great plot, with action, suspense, self-sacrifice, compassion and a lot more. In my family we watch a movie, via renting, before we buy it. This is one that we wanted within the first 30 minutes. Great addition to any movie library.[[ASIN:B0084IG8TM The Hunger Games [2-Disc DVD + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]

B0013D8LOK|5.0|This one of the best musicals that I have seen in a very long time. Mr. Depp is an incredible actor. His acting skill is up there with Jimmy Stewart.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. The puzzles are tough but not too tough. It is also nice and relaxing. I would recommend it for anyone, my nine year old son also likes it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Wasnt sure at first if this was a book I could get into but man was I wrong! What girl can resist a bad boy especially one that's hopelessly in love with you? Fun and exciting...makes you wish to be young again. The story is of a fresh faced college student trying to forget her old life beginning a new one with her best friend. But some how life doesn't think she needs normal but the life that a secret fighter with a craving for booze women and tatoos.  What's not to like?
B0072NWJRK|4.0|The author follows the Chinese and English officials' efforts to identify the murderers of a young English girl within contraints that various government higherups impose.  Even after the official investigation is declared closed, the girl's father continues the search and tracks down who was responsible for his daughter's death.  An interesting, but very sad account that helps the reader appreciate the many forces interacting at the time.
B0015DROBO|4.0|If you can get over the foreign words at the beginning of the book and stick with the story, which seems to be a little slow to start, then you're in for a ride that you'll truly enjoy.

B002F6FQGK|5.0|This is a great album. You can never go wrong with Florence + The Machine. I completely recommend it and all of her music.
B005KWL2IW|4.0|I bought this on Amazon out of curiosity because it was so cheap and I love metal. The album is pretty consistent but I definitely enjoyed the 2nd half of the album more. Joey Belladonna's singing is great and the rest of the band members show they still got the chops. Overall very satisfied with my purchase. Not the best metal album ever, but still great stuff.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This novel is so much more than an erotic romance! Cleverly written, engaging, and yes, erotic,<br />this fantastic book is a steamy read and then some.<br />Having heard of this book from the popular hype, it lived up to my expectations and far surpassed them, and<br />I found myself unable to put it down, enthralled by the incredible plot which was full of anticipation and completley held me in it's grip.<br />Definently a must-have for both bookworms and not so avid readers, 'Fifty Shades of Grey' will surprise you with it's original, imaginative and captivating plot, and yes, the sex is pretty hot too.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]<br /><br />So great you'll have to keep reading...<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345803493 Fifty Shades Darker: Book Two of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]<br />[[ASIN:0345803507 Fifty Shades Freed: Book Three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]

B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This is a great game. Grest time killing waiting at an airport or at the doc's office. Game is buggy sometime like purchases did not go thru but coins were deducted.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|This book is VERY entertaining. It manages to be smooth and easy to read while often engaging in clever turns of phrase. It is nostalgic and poignant as well as laugh-out-loud funny. It's everything an overworked technologist toiling in the bowels of the military industrial complex needed to re-acquire a necessary lightness of heart.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this is a nigh puzzle game. well executed, and well drawn. the game leaves no player feeling out of their depth. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games.
B006GECE9Y|3.0|a great browser controlled by apps limited to google store availability (even free ones) that can NOT be loaded onto my airpad (x10) tablet as it is not on google's approved tablet list. I am not happy about not being able to use many of these apps (such as print to pdf)
B008GFI4KY|5.0|Firstly, I have to be honest and say I've been an on-again-off-again fan of The Darkness up until now.<br /><br />I've loved a small selection of songs off the previous two albums.<br /><br />However, with this album I can honestly say I like every song and absolute love a heap of them.<br /><br />Favourites for me:<br /><br />Keep Me Hanging on with its simple riff that keeps the song rolling along.<br /><br />She's Just a Girl with its lighter more melodic versus before things thicken up a bit during the chorus. Cool riff.<br /><br />Forbidden Love is one of my absolute favourites, not so much because of the verses, which are a bit sappy to be honest, but the chorus gives me goosebumps the way the guitars kick in and Justin Hawkin's vocal work on the chorus. For me the chorus makes this song.<br /><br />Concrete meanwhile is almost like two songs in one in terms of the different sections. Awesome old time style rockin' roll and then featuring more dramatic sections - hard to explain.<br /><br />Must admit, on the first reaction flicking through the songs I had more of an immediate impact with the first two albums - in relation to the songs I like - but with this album it took a couple of spins, but now it's all I listen to in the car or at work with the 'phones.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I actually like this app better than the website. just wish I could move my pins around within the boards. there is probably a way I just haven't. figured it out yet.anyways love this app!!!
B002X0CNKA|4.0|Ok there's a bit of cheesiness here and it's due to two things: the sultry slow pace of *all* the songs and the singers with foreign accents. Sorry, but it's kind of odd hearing 80s pop (mostly a British art) played and sung in a jazz style (an American art form) by singers who sound like they're from Eastern Europe. Just a little incongruous. Anyway .... Addressing the other point, they shouldn't have done ALL the songs in a slow, dripping, soft style - they should have mixed it up.<br /><br />Despite the shortcomings, most of the tracks are decent, and a few have excellent arrangements and vocals, particularly the \\"Holding Back the Years\\" and \\"Every Breath You Take.\\" The accompaniment on most of the tracks is solid, with some good piano and guitar.<br /><br />So, if you like 80s pop .... and if you like jazz.... well, you gotta have this album, even though it could have been done better.

B008PE9GSA|3.0|With Rick Rubin behind the board, I expected a TRUE \\"return to form\\", but didn't find it on this barely-40-minute opus. While I haven't been a huge ZZ fan over the last two decades of the band (\\"ZZ Top's First Album\\" is still my fave), I nevertheless was looking forward to this one after a nine-year absence. You want growly, swamp-dirty, grungy, and NO light, bluesy ballads? You'll find that on the underrated 1996 \\"Rhythmeen\\", not here. Instead, a lot of the same ol', same 'ol, including not one, but TWO takes on the \\"Tush\\" riff.
B004Y6CS8I|4.0|Is supposed to be dubstep but on the universal way.<br />I mean most of the song could be listen on the FM \\"crappy\\" radio (this kind of radio they just wait some disc have been sold enough to be listen).<br /><br />Really great album, I'll try to follow this kind of artist who surprise you most of the time.
B001KZI2WW|1.0|Too bad my order was size 10 and I received the WRONG 11 size, I leave the country for months. now what should I do? Do I have to pay for send them from another country?<br />Don't buy this from online store unless you are commited to pay for the shipping & handling to send them back and wait for your correct size to arrive.<br /><br />the worst thing is that in the no online store is same price but right size.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great insight into the mind of an unbalanced woman!  Interesting moving from the perspective of the husband to that of the wife.  I loved it and highly recommend.

B0017I1IZA|4.0|It is such an advantage having the ability to download these books from Amazon to my kindle fire.  This only takes a few minutes to accomplish.<br /><br />I am now reading the 14th book of the Stephanie Plum series.  These books are totally entertaining.<br /><br />They contain both humor and intrigue.  The comedies of the bond enforcement role for Lula and Stephanie make the books hilarious.<br /><br />Once you start this series of books, you will not be able to stop with just one.<br /><br />Enjoy
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This whole series is a great read. This book is very thrilling and had some very sexy parts and also many mind turning conflicts.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the most entertaining game I have played.  If you have time to sit and be challenged, this is the game for you.<br /><br />I observed this game being played on a trip from London and could not wait to get home and download it to my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Amazon has many games that can be downloaded and I would recommend this game to anyone.<br /><br />I have introduced this game to 3 of my family members.
B001NLKT60|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series is great!  I have now read all three books, they are all riveting.  Steig was a wonderful author.  I just wish he would have had a chance to write more.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Recently purchased this amp to enhance the signal from my Sansa clip to car radio.  Works perfectly for that and is very convenient to use. I was pleasantly suprised to find the different EQ settings availble. Seems sturdy enough so far.  As long as it holds up I expect to be quite happy with this amp. Would have given it a 5 but think it is a bit pricey for what it is.  Time will tell.  Otherwise I would recommend it as it does what it claims.
B00005B36H|5.0|Its lateralus. An insanely complex composition to listen to. I bought the cd to have art work and high quality formatting
B005OT2YVA|1.0|My daughter and her friend gave this film a big thumbs down:<br /><br />\\"We hated it. We were bored out my minds, and couldn't understand the story line at all. The acting was moderate. The only good thing about this movie was that it made us super hungry, since it was 3 hours long!..... At least smear a little spot of dirt on \\"angel's\\" face by the end.\\"<br /><br />\\"So basically, don't watch it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sorry, people. We are very frustrated right now.\\"
B0053JJLLC|1.0|Utterly disappointing.  It's either MC has gotten worse or I've outgrown him as a writer.  The pace is bad, characterizations are mere tropes.  A refund perhaps?
B008XG1X18|5.0|great app! easy to use! simpler than the website and easier to pin. so happy they made a real app.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Let me start out by saying I haven't read the books yet, but plan on doing so after seeing the Hunger Games last week.  This movie has a terrific cast and a way of taking you immediately into the world of the future.  Cinematography was wonderful, costuming, and sound were first rate. Entertaining and action packed, you found yourself sitting on the edge of your seat as the events unfolded.  Great way to get away for a few hours.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is one disturbing book, I liked it. The first half was kinda slow, but the second half makes up for it.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Patrick Rothfuss takes the much accepted stereotype of the 'reluctant' dark hero to new heights with amazing levels of reflection and depth of character of the protagonist and the dark hero.. Kote aka kvothe. Along with the protagonist, he has created a supercast of other intriguing and interesting characters in his book 'The Name of the Wind'; the first of a trilogy. The book traces the emergence of the hero Kvothe from his rather benign beginnings as a kid born in the travelling troupe of performers... the 'Edemah Ruh'<br /><br />Introduced in the current time as a staid in-keeper wanting to stay away from troubles and situations demanding action, the story of Kvothe is revealed layer by intriguing layer through the hero's narration to the storyteller aka 'The Chronicler'. Bast, the 'companion-friend' of Kvothe... is used cleverly as a counterpoint to reveal hidden aspects of Kvothe through Bast's perception.<br /><br />Never before has a fantasy hero been given so many facets of character.. warrior, musician, magician. Instead of diluting, each of these facets re-inforce each other to give the character of Kvothe complicated, but solid mass.<br /><br />The myth of the dark cult of chandrian, the narration of the childhood of Kvothe among the troupe of Edema Ruh and his tenuous romance with the now appearing/ now disappearing mysterious character of the girl Denna are some of the meaty dimensions which alternate in the story telling. The best about this is , whenever the author breaks one of the narrative dimensions (the upbringing among the Edema Ruh)to enter another.. the reader continues to be hooked to the narrative.<br /><br />Equally endearing is the author's picturisation and characterisation of the University, its teachers and  Kvothe's fellow students. All very nicely blending with the storyline and the epoch.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful read and enough depth and material to leave the reader with a satisfied but 'wanting more' feeling...

B003JTHWJQ|2.0|I read this book as part of a study group that focuses on science and religion.  The group consists of some atheists, Christians, and me, the token Mormon.  Many of us are well educated and are engineers and scientists, but cover other areas of expertise.  We have covered many books on Christianity, science, and philosophy.  This was our first dive into a book on atheism.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, we were split on how good the book was.  We all agreed that Dawkins was a good writer and effectively pointed out weaknesses in religion and professed religious people.  We also agreed that he tended to focus on his favorite target of Fundamentalist Christians.  Since none of us are currently `Fundamentalist Christians' we agreed with him on many of his points, especially his attacks on people that reject science in the name of religion.  We also noted that many of his examples of bad behaviors by religious people are also duplicated in the name of race, nationalism, politics or differences in general.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the points he brought up to `prove' that there is no God, simply shot down some very poor proofs of God and prove that human nature is exhibited in religion as well as many other areas that he did not mention.  I would have liked to have seen some statistics backing up his claims that religious people are worse than non-religious people.  We all came up with many examples on our own of atheistic people doing the same sort of bad things that religious people do.<br /><br />One of the good things that Dawkins did point out was that atheists can be good without a belief in God.  This is a genuine problem that he highlights very effectively, and no one should feel that they are morally superior to another due to their belief or lack thereof in God.  As a side note, Mormon's and Christians do teach that there is a universal `conscience' or `light of Christ' that teaches everyone right from wrong.<br /><br />Now for the `Mormon' perspective.  Dawkins attacks a God that is nothing at all like the God that I believe in.  I believe in a God that is a Supreme Being that has mastered the laws of science and uses them for His purposes including the creation.  Therefore, there is no conflict in the existence of God and the fact that evolution can be explained by science.  I see God as the farmer that plants the seeds of a world and waits for it to be ready for intelligent life.  God creates by organizing existing elements which are co-eternal with Him.  We believe that God did not create matter out of nothing (as most Christians, Jews, and Muslims believe), but brings organization out of chaos.  Dawkins arguments assume that God created everything out of nothing.<br /><br />Dawkins obviously understands evolution, and even admits that the beginning of life has not been explained by science, but goes with the fact that probabilities would eventually create the right conditions and create life (the anthropic principle).  He is saying that the fact that this highly improbable event happened here on earth can be explained by the point that there are unnumbered worlds on which this could happen and it was bound to happen somewhere, sometime.  I do not find that convincing given the complexity of even the simplest forms of life.<br /><br />I also agreed with Dawkins on another point; that if God existed, that people that follow Him should behave better than those that don't follow Him.  I also am disturbed by people that claim to follow God, but do horrible things in His name.  Christ also had a serious problem with hypocrites.  Dawkins pointed out the hypocrites, but failed to list the many examples of religious people that practice what they preach.<br /><br />In general, I enjoyed reading this book and it brought out many interesting conversations in our group.  I think that if he had retitled the book `The Fundamentalist Christian Delusion', that it would have reflected much better what he was preaching.Dawkins attacks a God that is nothing at all like the God that I believe in.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|I've read several of the reviews on this movie and while some nail it, others just make no sense.  WW says that he liked the Spiderman and Batman Franchises but stated he didn't like The Avengers as it was nothing but a \\"cash cow\\".  Really WW?  Are you saying that Spiderman III was made to better the franchise and wasn't a cash cow?  All of the movies you mentioned are cash cows and pretty good entertainment.<br />The Avengers surpassed my expectations like no other movie ever has.  I had watched all the movies prior to the Avengers and was critical of a few of them.  I thought Captain America felt rushed and only created to move the franchise towards the Avengers movie.  Iron Man 2 was ok, but not as good as the first.  I happen to be very critical of movies and it drives my wife nuts.  I'm a penny pincher and will never go see a movie at the theater unless I think it's worthy.  I happened to go to this movie twice in the theater and loved it even more the 2nd time around.  Hands down the best superhero flik I've ever seen.  It surpassed the Batman and Spidey franchises and left me speechless and grinning ear to ear.  Even now, I will watch the trailer with my 3 year old and get chills.  Can't wait to watch it with him in the comfort of our own home !  September 25th I'm buying the movie for myself and my sister for her birthday.  She asked for it and she's not even a superhero movie fan.<br />Thank you Joss Whedon for creating a movie with wonderful entertainment value.  Don't get me wrong, the movie was much more than just entertainment, it was great writing, great balance between characters, great humor, and just a little character development although none was needed since we had all the prequels.<br />Joss is my hero.  Can't wait for phase II.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I thought puzzles were lame, but after this game I think differently! It's great too because you can buy new puzzle pictures if you want, but they also have quite a few puzzles for free. You can also pick how many pieces you want for each puzzle. I've never tried playing the mode where the pieces are rotated, so I can't speak to other people's problems with not being able to rotate the pieces. The only thing that could be better would be if a picture of the puzzle was available while playing to help with some of the more difficult puzzles.

B005LAIHSQ|2.0|My wife and I had looked forward to this film only to be severely disappointed.<br /><br />The good in this film is entirely on Charlize Theron. Her acting is superb and you can tell that the other actors in this film are trying to rise to her level when they share scenes with her. Her queen is so evil it will give you shivers. Unfortunately, how scary-bad the rest of the film is will also give you shivers. As much as I like Chris Hemsworth, I couldn't help but feel that he was phoning this one in, at least a bit. Maybe because most of his scenes were opposite or adjascent to Kristen Stewart, I don't know for sure, but he never feels like more than a muscle-head in this film. It was like he wandered off of an action movie set and into the wrong studio. The dwarves had a lot of potential given the tremendous casting, but they are poorly used and underwhelming. The visuals are fantastic, but to be fair, they aren't anything unique in this CG-age of cinema. I didn't see anything new or innovative.<br /><br />Finally, I must jump on the bandwagon with everyone else - Kristen Stewart was dreadful. Aside from her complete lack of emotional output, I can't recall a scene in this film when her mouth was hanging open. By the end of the film, my wife and I had become so bored that we took to MST3k-ing the film, adding much dialogue about her gaping maw. It was the only way we could make it to the end. The Snow White of this film is supposed to draw great pathos from the audience, have a harrowing ordeal, and then transform into a brilliant warrior monarch. All of this is delivered with the emotional range of a mannequin. In a time when several versions of Snow White are hitting the market at once, you would think that the producers would want theirs to redefine the character, making her seem more than the fairy tale character. Instead we get a vain attempt to copy the Snow from \\"Once Upon A Time\\" and do so with a far inferior actress.<br /><br />This film was promoted on fourmajor points: Stewart, Hemsworth, Theron, and the visuals. Of those four, only Theron delivers. Take her part out and this film is complete rubbish. I can't honestly recommend this to anyone.

B007DIQC90|4.0|Of Monsters and Men is a folkish collective that comes more to the pop side than the folk side, favoring big hooks, Hey Hey and La La La choruses and harmonies that recall (for me anyway) 10,000 Maniacs. There's a lot of fairytale inspired lyrics, like on \\"Dirty Paws\\" and \\"Your Bones,\\" with foot pounding drums and vocal interplay. They sing with a happy enthusiasm, yet at times the topic is sadness - like \\"Dirty Paws'\\" epic battle of the birds Vs the bees and a sky colored \\"Black by the killing machines.\\" They may not be as cold as Bjork, but they sure do try.<br /><br />But at the same time, there's a joy to the album. \\"Mountain Sound\\" has a classic pop vibe to it, and \\"Six Weeks\\" will bring Arcade Fire to mind. I caught them at this year's Newport Folk Festival and they made a gleeful racket on stage, with the crowd La La-ing to the band's every bouncy chorus. The earthy sound of the debut is even more open and enthusiastic onstage than on record (I admist, I bought the disc after seeing them as opposed to knowing the songs beforehand), and was surprised at just how well the show translated to recording. That's a feat not too many bands can manages, and the six kids pull it off nicely.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Arcade Fire, Edward Sharpe and 10,00o Maniacs.
B000GKW4HG|5.0|The Papo dinosaur line is outstanding and this parasaurolophus is no exception. Well sculpted with nice poses. (Their t-rex is the best on the market, with his posable jaw.) They make me want to build a diorama for them to hang out in.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|This album is fantastic. Brings you in, and doesn't let you go. I was skeptical about purchasing this album (after listening to their newest album and feeling that after a couple of great songs the album falls flat) and my opinion of the band was completely turned around. Hopefully they can produce another album like this next time around, while keeping up with the hits.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh! Thank you! These books are outstanding. You pushed me into a corner where I could not help but keep reading. Not only is your story crafting top notch, your words and character development created a rich tapestry. I am telling everyone I know, in any way I can, to read your books. (For the love of Pete, charge more for the Kindle set, man!) Thank you for a wonderful ride. I look forward to whatever else you have up your sleeve. Sincerely, Christopher

B0094OLFUW|2.0|So after listening to this album many times I'm going to say it's just a snoozefest and almost sounds formula. In some ways I was probably expecting the XX to embrace other aspects of their personality more strongly. Given all the XX remixes out there (Have you heard their awesome remix of \\"You've got the Love?) it would have been nice for them to uptick on their more clubby/dance prowess (Islands).  How about highlighting their more punky elements?  Sadly a great song like Crystalized is now a complete anomaly in their catalog. Instead they've chosen to make the entire album MORE minimal, MORE hushed, MORE melancholy. Given that the debut was one of the most subtle albums ever, I wonder if this was a good idea. When I heard the first single Angels, I didn't think it boded well for this album.  They forget to bring any kind of underlying melody or something to draw the listener in. You start with two strong songs: Chained and Fiction and then the album literally dissolves into a hushed rhythmless, beatless, bassless mist. This album might be good for a late night listening mood piece, but I don't want to have to stay up to 2 AM to enjoy it. Always be skeptical of artists you like. I guarantee that most people who download the entirety of this album will abandon it in favor of putting its few good tracks on shuffle with tracks from the debut. I choose 3: Chained, Fiction, Swept Away

B008602KQI|1.0|This is one of the most boring films I have ever seen....watching paint dry is a better alternative.  I expected a lot more from this movie due to the reviews and even my 71 year old Mother-In-Law's opinion.  I kept watching it hoping something good would be around the corner, but that corner never came.  At an 1 hour and 2 mins into it I kept thinking, \\"Ok, it could still be good...the music is ramping up...maybe there will actually be a battle or at least a slap fight\\"...Nothing....1 Hour and 47 mins into it (still grasping onto a semblance of hope) the music ramped up and I thought, \\"Ok, here comes the battles I have been waiting for\\"...nothing.  Even if you could make it through the tedium, the story is just silly (modernized 16th century clothing??)...There are no explanations of how and why society is this way...Just apparently one city for the rich and the rest of the planet puts up with it???...If you have an exciting life and your doctor wants you to rest and have no stress, then this is the movie for you!! Insomniacs, here is the cure you have been waiting for!!...take a shot of Nyquil and watch this movie and you will have your best nights sleep in years
0955153077|1.0|The title of the book is just misleading, it's not a book for beginners at all. the only thing a beginner could achieve from the book is just the first chapter which is about setting the photoshop ready for starting. the title should be The art of .....<br /><br />I won't suggest this book for any one who just started digital painting, sorry but it was a waste of money on a misleading book.

B003K16PFU|3.0|George Orwell's \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is an interesting book describing his experiences fighting in the Spanish Civil War.  These experiences are what turned him away from Stalinistic Communism.  One thing to remember while reading this book is that while Orwell rejects Stalin and Communism, he only switches camps to Socialism.  If you think he becomes Conservative (in the American sense) during this event, then you'll be confused by his world-view in this book.  His basic assumptions of how the world should work sound like those of a freshman Political Science student at a radical university (i.e., extremely left-wing) and will leave you scratching your head trying to figure out what he's talking about.  So, that's one source of possible confusion while reading the book.  Another is inherent in the event itself.  This is not a chronicle of two sides fighting.  Instead, it's a chronicle of many sides fighting for and against each other (at least Communists, Socialists, Anarchists, the \\"government,\\" and Fascists (Franco)).  Frankly, he doesn't doesn't do a very good job of explaining all of it.  There's very little background explaining what led to the Revolution and reading many of his pages is like looking at a bowl of alphabet soup:  it's just a sea of meaningless acronyms floating around.  Another issue is that he doesn't intersperse his chronicling of personal events with his political explanations very well:  his political asides go on for scores of pages and totally disrupt the flow of the book.  So, even though it's a very interesting book, I have to subtract a star for the technical implementation and give it merely an OK 3 stars out of 5.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a great book with lots of lessons for all of us.  While it's written for a middle school audience, and I've been out of middle school for many, many years, I found this to be a poignant story about character, courage, and perseverance. I enjoyed the different points of view portrayed in the chapters and particularly enjoyed talking with my middle school daughter about the lessons learned in the book.

B003H6KRIE|5.0|Matt Damon as Jason Bourne in Blu-ray on my new 61\\"...incredible!!  I had seen all three movies before but not in Blu-ray.  Well worth the surprisingly low price.  Colors are crisp, sound is awesome on my surround-sound, & action as filmed is perfect for the big screen; right in my face.<br />The additional features accompanying each film were great: especially deleted scenes, add'l features alone were worth the purchase.  You must get this!  One of the best Blu-ray packages ever offered.

Especially around the concept of specializing and allowing people to focus on one task really well.  I've recommended this book to several clients- especially anyone selling software...it the principles apply well in many other businesses.  Buy the book and implement the process!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I am big Blake Crouch fan, in particular of 'Run' and his co-author novel 'Serial Killers', and now 'Pines\\". I like his style, he builds suspense in a way that makes you lean forward in your seat while youre reading, wide eyed, and open mouthed waiting to see what happens next. His characters seem not only real but likable, they have a rawness to them, an emotional charge that makes you relate to the way they think (at least for me).<br /><br />This book definitely has a Twilight Zone feel to it, but once you get to the \\"explanation\\" it all comes together perfectly. I actually came to the conclusion of the ending before I read it, bc to me it was the only way that everything would make sense. And it did! I know some people here feel differently about it, but I think the ending is as realistic and as interesting as he could have made it with the way the story was going. I think had he gone in any other direction, the book would have been ruined.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I received a digital copy of this. Upon transferring it onto my PC, my computer crashed. I fixed it and converted the file format to avoid a potential virus.<br /><br />True story... I got half way through somehow and all of a sudden my kindle started freezing on me. Each time I would restart, select this title, and read a few pages, it would freeze again until finally, it stayed frozen. Even Amazon could not figure out the problem so they had to send me a new one... &#34;oh my!&#34;<br /><br />The book itself was horrible. My boss told me it was sick and since I'm in poor standings with him, I took a crack at it to give us some kind of common interest. As it turns out, even he couldn't take the poor writing and he isn't what I would consider picky or critical.<br /><br />Long story short: nobody likes this crap.

B007MDB71O|5.0|The best Sci-fi adventure to come out in a long time. It's way better than Avatar and all the Star Wars Prequels combined, and it's a lot more fun too, yet it has gotten a lot of hate for \\"ripping off\\" those films when in fact it's the other way around. A lot of people never gave this movie a chance or at least give it the credit it deserves.<br /><br />The visuals look great, including some of the real locations where the movie was filmed,so it wasn't all just filmed inside a green screen room.The action was fun, the musical score really added something extra to this film and I really liked the cast.I hope someday they make a sequel or two. If there was ever a movie that needed and deserved and that desperately screamed out loud for a sequel , it's John Carter.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was suggested for our book club and I purchased it so that I would be prepared.  To say that I was disappointed in it would be an understatement.  The language was foul and I am thankful to say that I know no one who talks this way in \\"real life.\\"  The people were without exception completely unlikable and I ended the book not able to identify one character about whom I cared.  I read many and varied books and there have been few that I disliked as much as I disliked this book.

B005LAIISA|1.0|This is one of the moives that I can put in the I will never see it again group. That is the way how the acting was done. Both side are mean each other. The girl is mean to her father who is trying to her out and she is mean to her best friend and say,\\" That he is never her friend\\" when she meets and talk to the boy. At the end it is her best friend the one that she say \\"That he is never her friend\\" that save her. The ones that get a ship, are mean to each other. All I can say is \\"That is other movie that I should have never use my money on and to see it. It was not funnying it was very mean and very hurtful that they acted. I wanted to get up and get my money back but I do not. If I could I give this moive NO STAR AT ALL. I WILL NEVER SEE THIS AGAIN!!!
B0086QS7N2|5.0|I've been pouring over the reviews of Rush albums on Amazon. There isn't a single studio album that has below a 4 star average. There are six 4 1/2 star albums (2112, A Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Signals, and Clockwork Angels) and one 5 star rated album (Moving Pictures). I know reviews don't mean anything but the reviews on Amazon agree with my personal preference when it comes to Rush. The 4 1/2 - 5 star rated albums are absolutely my favorites (with Counterparts being the only exception to the rule).<br /><br />I would honestly propose that Clockwork Angels is the best album since Signals. To me Rush has finally found the perfect balance between what was, what is, and what can be with Clockwork Angels. The musicianship is at an all time high, Lee has finally found a balance between his vocal comfort zone and belting it out like he did in the 70's, Lifeson is given a chance to shine on several tracks providing some well crafted solos, Peart is as good as ever (despite his track being just a bit too quiet), and most importantly this album feels like Rush. Let me explain that last point a bit.<br /><br />In my opinion Test For Echo, Vapor Trails and Snakes & Arrows didn't really have the same flavor as previous Rush albums. Don't get me wrong they are still good albums. There were parts that sounded like Rush, however on a whole the albums were off when compared the previous entries. Clockwork Angels, on the other hand, has a feel that is much closer to what Rush sounded like in the 70's, 80's and early 90's. I know this point is very qualitative but there has to be at least one Rush fan out there that understands what I am talking about.<br /><br />So, whats the only thing this album desperately needs? Extra care during the mixing process. The mixing is good (tweaking the equalizer to the exact perfect values can help a bit) but could be better. Put on a decent pair of headphones, sit back and relax, close your eyes and listen to The Camera Eye, Freewill, or Analog Kid (and many more songs) and you can easily spot the difference (I'm completely inept when it comes to sound quality and even I can tell a difference) between the the past and the present when it comes to production value. The Wreckers and The Garden were instantly put into my Rush Top 20 songs list but they can sound obnoxious when listening at loud volumes.<br /><br />Rush needs to run with the momentum gained from this album and put more emphasis on production values in order to get an album that is dubbed \\"best album since Moving Pictures\\" rather than \\"best album since Signals\\".e, Freewill, or Analog Kid (and many more songs) and you can easily spot the difference (I'm completely inept when it comes to sound quality and even I can tell a difference) between the the past and the present when it comes to production value.

0374531269|5.0|In the book a long way gone, Ishmael lives in a small village in Sierra Leone. He lives a fairly average life in his village. He is a great kid but kind of a troublemaker. We then follow Ishmael to a different village  so he can perform in a talent show with his friends. I like this because it shows you that he is not very different from us. He is lucky to be there because his home village is attacked. He tries to go back to find his family but is unsuccessful. He begins to run away from the war all the time until he reaches a village where his family were said to be there. It was untrue. I thought this part made my heart turn out of my chest because the author tells so descriptively how he never saw his family again. I don't know how someone could ever get enough closure to tell the world that the last time he saw his immediate family was when he was 12 years old. Could you imagine the last time seeing your family be at age 12.<br /> He again runs from the war. He ends up in a safe village protected by the army. He is forced into the war because the village is surrounded by rebels. He lives a viscous killing life for two straight years, also getting addicted to many drugs. I think this would be so hard to deal with because he has only drugs and a G3 to give him false safety. He is then taken to a rehabilitation center for child soldiers. He lives there for months until he is found by his long lost uncle and lives with him. Ishmael Beah still gives inspirational speeches today about child soldiering.
0316098329|5.0|This book tells a story about how untainted children are. The negative behaviors we observe in children are learned behaviors.

B003Q7B78S|1.0|Talk about a film I wanted to love but couldn't even like, `Orlando' fails at doing practically anything.  This had all the potential in the world.  Tilda Swinton has become that godlike creature I adore and consider incapable of fault thanks to her string of tremendous performances over the past few years and so seeking out her earlier work, this was one I was most excited for.  The androgynous creature known as Tilda Swinton is always alluring in her ability to effortlessly evoke both sexes even when not attempting to, and so the idea of her portraying an ageless person who lives lives as both a man and a woman was intriguing and stimulating to me.  The concept of the film itself, adapted or inspired or `I'm not really sure' from a classic Virginia Woolf story, should have been golden.<br /><br />Sadly, this feels utterly devoid of purpose or point.<br /><br />Swinton's performance is devoid of all emotion and so the film winds up dragging out based on sheer boredom alone.  It doesn't say anything of note, and it had all the prospect of doing just that.  Sally Potter's take on this tale is so skeletal and meaningless that I literally got a headache trying to make heads and tales of it.  There are no explanations made for the gender swap midway through and even Orlando's ageless state is never really given a specific meaning or even a conclusive reason.  I was also rather displeased with the way in which Swinton played her character because she never once evoked the feeling of being a man.  I never questioned her sexuality or gender because she was also undoubtedly a woman, which made the first half rather awkward and unbelievable.  The character her/himself was also aloof and without any compelling characteristics.<br /><br />By the end of the film I was dumbfounded that anyone could find this fascinating in the least, since it was stripped of all fascinations thanks to the thankless direction the film took.<br /><br />It is a pretty picture, with great costumes and sets (stunning) and the cinematography is enriching, but overall this is just stupid.nd sets (stunning) and the cinematography is enriching, but overall this is just stupid.

0525953728|5.0|The book is like many others that have been written by Spec Ops personnel; whether American, British, German or French.  The caveat is that these war fighters put an end to the worst of the bad.  Of course the author has with the writing of this book challenged the \\"official report\\" as to how it happened.  It appears that the current administration is still wanting to do the \\"PC\\" and not offend those who wish to harm America.  However, it does appear that the administration and all its minons want this mans head because he told the truth.  Isn't that what we are all about as a nation, telling the truth...then why is there so many of our \\"arm chair generals\\" in the administration concerned about a book that tells the truth.  The operators were doing their job! Why not for once tell the story as the truth and not what we should hear so as not to offend those who would be our enemies?<br />Too many \\"arm chair generals\\" in too many wars that this country has fought have tried to dictate terms and rules of engagement.  Been there done that, and it is now time to allow the military to do its job!<br />Good book and appreciate these individuals and their families who sacrafice so much!

B003EW4KB6|3.0|This review is for the SHM-SACD.<br /><br />I am not going to write a huge review about this release so her it goes.  This is one of rocks best albums ever released. It is a classic that has and will stand the test of time. Why the three stars? It sounds like what would happen to your cassett when you used the dolby noise reduction feature that was mean to take out the take out the high end hiss from the tape. Unfortunatly it was a disaster since it also cut into the highs of the music. For those of you not old enough to know what DNR is or was meant to accomplish just understand that this release suffers from a lack of clarity and has a dullness that would seem to be associated with some type of noise reduction. It isnt horrible but IMO not worth the high price tag. Update: After many times listening to this release, I am still sticking with the noise reduction part of the review. The reason for the update is to make note that this release does have much more detail, punch and wideness (than the redbook cd) that make it a good listen. I didn't think it was worth the high price tag before but I am not unhappy with my purchase so I guess I am retracting that part. This release would be stellar if not for the noise reduction.
0061652768|5.0|Well written, very interesting account of the times, and family, sad, funny.<br />Read it twice, several years ago first, and now again.<br /> A very good read for book clubs.
B003XU02QG|4.0|I watched this film for two reasons:<br />1) Magnet distribution (they rarely let me down)<br />2) Neil is directing it (I loved Descent)<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed; the fight choreography is dense and varied, the score is authentic and alive. As for the tacked on romance I rather enjoyed that aspect; even though it's so convientient, it allowed for some sort of \\"feel good\\" ending.<br /><br />Also I found myself rooting for the bad guys, which I think is a credit to the director and the actors. I mean the Romans were invading, raping, stealing, etc and still I was rooting for Fassbender and his team during the course of the movie (even after finding out about Etains situation).<br /><br />Highly recommended for it's great acting, fighting sequences, and sweeping landscapes.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I am far from not being (positively) biased towards Neil's work but this was by far my favorite book from that year. He is an amazing storyteller and his works are truly a contemporary masterpieces.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|If you loved the books than of course you will love the movies but the music has always been so much a part of the films and totally sets the mood for the action and the emotions that are portrayed.  I highly recommend all of them but this one is the best.

B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I got this toy for my 7 yr old grandson. He loves it! The size is kinda of large for him but he manages to handle it just fine.  The HailFire is a newly added model to the Nerf family.  It has rapid firing ability because it is an automatic.  Which I was not aware of but when I found out I thought that was a great and fun bonus.  The gun comes with 4 cartridges (but actually holds up to 8) which each hold 6 darts. It shoots VERY fast and VERY far.  Any other opponent in the game that is unfortunate enough to have an other older model of a Nerf toy will be in trouble because as they are reloading, this Nerf HailFire is just blasting away at them :-).  The toy is great fun, it only takes minutes to assemble.  Except for the cartridge cover.  We did find ourselves spending a bit of time getting it to snap into place but once it was done it was smooth sailing from there. I would recommend this the HailFire.  I must add that if you give this toy to a young child like my grandson that you always count their darts when they put the toy away.  Due to the rapid fire ability and the distance that the darts can travel sometimes they get lost or misplaced.
B00628CCQY|5.0|Im and old school kind of guy and Opeth certainly showed they're talent and uncompromising use of their skills. Mikael Ackerfelt and Steven Wilson do an amazing job with their vocals and Wilsons piano keys were brilliant in this album. Peter Lindgreen played the most beautiful sounds on the guitar. Martin Mendez did an excellent job infusing the deep dark sounds of the base for the intense brutal and mellow parts of the Album. Last but not least Martin Lopez drumming is second to none. I have always enjoyed hearing his stlye of using symbols in such a marvelous way that keeps me listening to this album to this day. I have this on Vinyl and CD. To show my support i downloaded this album on my phone. Ive listened to this album since it has been released and it is the only album i have to listen to from beginning to end. Just like the classic records.  There is no autotune just amazing artists pouring their soul and talent into their masterpiece. That is what Blackwater Park is.

B008PE9GSA|4.0|First off. I love ZZ Top. Second, I quit paying attention after the release of Antenna. Needles to say, I could not wait for this to bust loose. I purchased the first four tracks when they came out on the ep Texicalli. Now that the rest have been released it rounds it out.<br />This could easily be a 5 star release, only one problem with this for me. I cant get past the guitar tone. Seems too fuzzy and thinner than normal. Other than that this is a strong effort. While Billy Gibbons is considered an innovator of sorts, his tone just falls short for me. Some people may really like it on the other hand, but for trying to capture the sound of back in the day it does not. The way the songs are written, yeah. I think that is what happened on Antenna to me as well. Way stronger of a release in la Futura though. His playing and arrangement is great and these are some great tunes. I will be jammin out to this for a bit.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have a hard time falling asleep some nights and when I do, I can count on this to ease me into a peacefully sleep.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its a great game. it has a lot of great games in it. It can definatally make time go by.
B007CKNX28|5.0|...because I bought this album on the day of release, unheard, and have been listening to it at least 3 or 4 times a week. I know that it's \\"hip\\" to accuse people of being a hipster, but White is no hipster, he's an extremely talented musician who has put out what I believe to be the album of the year,so far. I gave it 5 stars because it's as close to being a perfect album as it can be. On a percentage scale, 1% to 100%, I'd give it a 97%. All hipster talk aside, whatever this 58 yr. old rock fan can find wrong with Blunderbuss is negligible, to to point of being non-existant. Everyone I've recommended this disc to agrees with me. Those who don't like the White Stripes or Jack White probably won't like Blunderbuss. Everyone else should rock out with this kid who does it so well.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Good idea for a story. I'd heard so much about the trilogy and couldn't wait to read it. I really tried to get into it. Unfortunately, it reads like it's written by a dreaming teenager who barely made it through high school english. I forced myself through the first book and hastely bought the second, afraid that it would probably be a more painful read than the first (not painful in the sense of The Shades, mind you, just painful to get through). I can't get past the first couple of chapters of Fifty Shades Darker because, it is, as expected, written as poorly as the first. It just doesn't get better. A very poor waste of my money. Shame on me!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a lot of fun for all ages. Mom &amp; kids are all addicted!  Requires attention, quick decision making and fast hands. Great graphics. Enjoy!
B0009VJWKY|5.0|These girls are amazing, never saw anything like them. Modern instruments but see that they are violins, bass, violia etc. in a new way. Saw them in concert once, very good. Duel, Wintersun, Sugerplum are my favorites in this one.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|It is hard to believe that I have been listening to Brother Dylan now for fifty years, some good, some bad, some fat some lean, the years that is, just like the lyrics in this 35th studio album. As usual, especially of late, he either soars with the lyrical angels or is down in wordsmith skid row with the rest of us. Also as usual of late, at least since World Gone Wrong, some of the material as befits the times is dark, dark as the night with no apparent light at the end of that night. More on this below.<br /><br />Getting back to the difference in listening to Dylan then and now though.  In the old days I had to sneak up into my room and listen to his stuff on a local folk music program on my transistor radio (for the younger set that was a small battery- operated radio we could use to listen to rock and roll and other parent- disapproved music without them knowing it. Sorry, no up or down loading, you just took what  you could get and on some nights, usually Sunday,  you could get Moon Odom's Blues Hour out of Chicago and be in seventh heaven). Why was I forced into exile? My parents blew their collective tops when I played Dylan's raspy-voiced Blowin' In The Wind for the 217th straight time on the family record player. See they objected not so much to the lyrics (although they, thankfully,  probably didn't understand them) as to that damn voice, especially compared to their generation's Frank Sinatra or the Inkspots let's say.<br /><br />Well, Brother Dylan's voice if it was raspy then is more like cracked glass now. But did (does) anybody listen to his stuff for the voice (or the melody). Hell, no, or at least I hope it is hell no, it has always been about the lyrics, about some theme that interested him at any particular point and that is the case here with Tempest. Bob Dylan could have been the president of the generation of''68, my generation, but after the first fanfare as the voice of that generation he chose to move on and re-invent himself as what has now become an ageless (and endlessly touring) troubadour, something out of the old medieval tradition.<br /><br />And so we have had, and have here, ballad offerings (Tempest, a.k.a. Captain Ahab meets the Titanic), musings, prose poems, muttering of an old sometimes wise man (Long and Wasted Years), perfectly meshed lyrics (Soon After Midnight), songs of love, thwarted love, love gone bad, love with regret and no regrets, murmuring of dark times here and now and to come , a nod to fallen comrades (Roll On John), and just plain old fashioned  Dylan whimsy.<br /><br />Does that sound familiar? Well, it should it because it is the \\"formula\\" Dylan has been using at least since Bringing It All back Home and Highway 61 Revisited (is there any darker song here than Desolation Row by the way). And in the end that is why you should listen to this album. While we all know, and have had it pounded into our heads almost daily, this is no country for old men (or old women either) note this, and note it well, you need to listen to this old man in order to know what it was like in the times when men and women wrote meaningful and worthy lyrics for keeps even when sung with cracked glass voices. Enough said
006016848X|2.0|First and foremost, this author has been married several times. He clearly has know clue about making things last. Finally, his university where he obtained a PhD is no longer accredited. That says a lot about him and the information in this book. Life does not have a one fit all solution. We are better of taking information from someone who practices what they preach.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins was the 2nd book in the Hunger Games Series. The story captures the reader's attention and holds it throughout the book. The people in the story were made to come to life. Suzanne Collins writes in a way that makes the reader feel the frustration and pains of the characters. The story line that continues from the Hunger games is gripping. I found it to have an odd ending leaving the reader hanging wanting to run out and get the next book, which was OK for me since the books are all out but I hate having to wait until the next one is released! I did go and get the 3rd one as soon as I could.[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, Book 2)]]
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|fun to play can be hard sometimes but that is what makes it fun. should have easier levels for people that find it hard
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Sound of Music is among the top musical movies ever created. The story is based on the experiences of a real family during world war 2. The music, written by Rogers and Hammerstein is wonderful and people can be heard singing or humming along. Julie Andrews was incredible as Maria, a young woman torn between her feelings for the family where she served as governess and the convent she was determined to join. It's a movie the whole family can enjoy together. My family sings the songs when we are together, they lighten our hearts. I will never forget my first time seeing this movie in the theatre. I bet it would still draw a crowd if re-released. Five stars are not enough to rank this movie! GREAT GREAT GREAT[[ASIN:B003VS0CX8 The Sound of Music (Three-Disc 45th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)]]
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Very good, only downside is having to probably wait a year at least for the next one.  Reading Name of the Wind now per other reviews suggesting they are similar.  They are not really.  Both are good, this is better.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is a very well written story of action,resilience, loyalty and honor, keeping the reader glued to the book. I read it in a weekend. It was definitely important to have read the first two books in this series before going on to this one. The stage is set and the characters developed in the first two books and continues through Mockingjay. The feelings of the main characters jump off the page and draw the reader in emotionally as well. There are many twists and turns that keep the reader on the edge of his seat. This book ended the series giving the reader a ride out of reality that was excellent.  [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]]
B0019N8P2W|4.0|If you were an avid Daria lover like myself you would use the phrase almost perfect to describe this product. It contains all the seasons and episodes of Daria that we've yearned for for years as well as the two movies. This Beavis & Butthead spin-off was one of the best shows on MTV back when it actually played music. Television networks like LOGO, Teen Nick, etc. would tease us by randomly airing one or two episodes of Daria, but this set allows me to enjoy every minute of Daria's wit and sarcasm. The only downside is that because of licensing purposes the collection does not contain any of the original music which was a big part of the show. The music in Daria was a time capsule into the late 90's and early 00's and without it this product is almost perfect. Nevertheless, I'm grateful that this product is finally available and the note explaining the absence of music in this series is quite humorous. i purchased this when it was first available and was given a price adjustment when the price was lowered shortly after I purchased it. Overall a great purchase.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is my favorite Bible app to use easy to use lots of features every thing you need and lots of translations to choose from
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Fantastic Series from Doctor Who and the last season with Russell T Davies, Julie Gardner and David Tennant; also featuring Catherine Tate as the Doctor's Companion. Chock full of tons of special features including commentary for EVERY SINGLE EPISODE and behind the scenes looks via Doctor Who Confidential and an especially fun cast experience with David Tennant's video diaries.<br /><br />This is my favorite series and features the Doctor with Donna Noble as they go on adventures with Agatha Christie, journey to Pompeii, the Planet of the Ood and look for episodes that bring back fan favorites like Rose Tyler, Captain Jack Harkness and Sarah Jane, among others.
0060936223|5.0|The two most appropriate words to describe the feel of this book. Patti Smith bared her life in such straight forward steady pose that you lived through her for the time you spent reading. Her world described was so intwined in the legacy of the heart of a generation, her comrades all the famous, yet reading about them within the pages of Just Kids you felt the commonplace, the daily struggle and the tenderness that two souls shared through it all. Many times it struck me that thanks to Patti the world is privileged to know the real Mapplethorpe. Her memoir is also his biography in the most personal compassionate way. Thank you for sharing so much Ms. Smith.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Gillian Flynn.  I saw her interviewed this past spring, made a mental note of her book, but didn't get it until I saw that it was at the top of the Most Read books in our own city of Bellingham, WA.  (This intrigued me because we have avid readers out here--but usually they're a tad behind the trends back East--but not in this case.)  From the moment you open the book, you might as well postpone the rest of your To Do list until you finish it.  I found myself thinking about its twists and turns during the reluctant times I had to put it down before I was finished.  Walking the dogs, I would furnish different plot lines in my mind and couldn't wait to see if I was to be proved correct.  I have read a great many thrillers with a lot of twists, but jaded as I am--usually able to figure things out--Flynn had me right to the end.  And even if I had figured it out, her writing style is so bewitching, I would have stayed with it anyway, just to hear her tell the story.  I have already told several of my friends to be sure to pick up a copy.  Unexpectedly great read.
0439023521|5.0|Seeing the movie was amazing, but since I published [[ASIN:B0096XDKFY Mana]], I found so much more in the writing. First thing I noticed about this book was the plot, which stood out immediately (which is a good thing in my book!) The action was set up perfectly and the best thing was; I found no plot holes in the book, so that mean's the author really did her research when she wrote this book.<br /><br />I know there haven't been any new reviews so far, but I want to read them all and review them! Definitely read this book if you haven't already.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This blu-ray is great.  Some of the best performers get together for an \\"at mic\\" performance of the Les Miserables music with costumes and a little dramatic staging that just sets the mood
0316017922|5.0|the book looks nice and the font is right for me. This book is maybe a guide for me  for many years so I bought the hard cover one.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun and challenging way to pass time. I like the variety of sizes and levels. This game is also visually. appealing.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|First off the driving controls are way too sensitive! O kept crashing into things. Then, the game keeps cutting off for NO reason! Sometimes it happens when im in the pause menu.  Other times, i just try to start the game and it cuts off faster than you can say,****!The reason im giving this game a 3 out of 5 is because the walking controls are good, the graphics a good, and i bought this game when it was 99 cents.
B005F2BHGE|5.0|Very well done movie .Excelente production , plot , I agree with other reviews this plot can became a sequel , sensational.Van dame kicking asses still .Money well spend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The 3rd book in the triology of Hunger Games.  I couldn't put the book down but read it straight through.  It was exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat, waiting to find out what's next.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I was hoping for something that real delved unabashedly into the character of a man who was at the center of so much design evolution. If you lived through the personal computer evolution of the 70's, this is an utterly gripping and at times behind the scenes view of what happened. Definitely don't miss this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love that I can use pinterest on my phone and kindle now. works well as far as I'm concerned.. one thing I would improve on is be able to move one pin from one board to a different on without having to repin
B007UQRW62|5.0|What a glorious feeling you will have as you peruse the extras for this collector's gem.  Of course<br />the main prize is the special edition of the movie itself.  Plus you get a very nifty umbrella to<br />announce that you are a fan of \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" every time you  use it. I haven't<br />counted but I have probably seen the movie 20 times through the years.  If you bought this<br />special edition, you probably already know all of the songs and quite a bit of the dialogue. How<br />wonderful that Debbie Reynolds of the original cast is still living as of this set's publication date.<br />So classic movie fan, which song from the movie will you be singin' as you go dancin' in the rain?

B0055SWM08|5.0|Coats, soothes. Protects. Without those embarrassing side effects. Do not drink while using; may cause drowsiness. More like a psychological puzzle to get you talking about yourself than a game. I've been disclosing personal details to strangers all day!
0525953728|5.0|This book by M. B. aka \\"Mark Owen\\" was awesome. I finished the book in two days and could not easily put it down to go to bed.  The story type is one I wish more people in this line of work would share for the rest of us.  I have read a few books like it since I was a kid in High School, usually books about Vietnam Helicopter pilots like \\"Chickenhawk\\" or spy stories written by ex spies.  This book is a must read! All the information is already out there in the public domain, no secrets here.  But the story is one that we all have a right to read. Watching the Twin Towers fall in NYC on 9/11 2001 was a terribly sad experience. We all have a right as US citizens to read the conclusion to that story, or at least a very important part of the ending.  The ending made me proud, made me cry, and the author is as brave at home to share his experiences with his Seal teammates as he was in combat missions. All the guys who train and bleed and fight or even die for us, to protect our freedoms and safety, we can never thank them enough or be more supportive.  The entire Seal Team is a national treasure and to get a glimse into their lives and activities is rare indeed.  Thank you M. B. and thank you to the Seals who continue to prepare and protect our Country.  Tactics evolve, things change, enemies adapt, and we will always have to appreciate that knowing the basics of how we engage our enemies is a good thing for the rest of us to know. The playing field changes fast enough that last years tactics probably are not the same as this years. The Government talks, the generals talk, the media talks... we are not really as interested in hearing the spin.  \\"Mark's\\" first hand story is much more interesting, and the truth is so refreshing and free of BS. GREAT BOOK, Easy read and worth every penny. I hope he and others like him write more books. Thank you again for all you and those like you sacrificed for us \\"couch potatoes.\\"
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the trilogy!  I definitely turned fifty shades of red reading these books.  And surprisingly, Wikipedia is very informative.  I read all 3 books in 5 days.  Either you read the first book and get sucked in or it's just not for you.  It's a great escape from the everyday read and the everyday.<br />I just read some of the other reviews.  If you were looking for a book that is scholarly and realistic then you picked the wrong book.  Really?  Come on.  It's fantasy.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|It was so much fun watching this classic Johnny Depp movie. Definitely one of my favorite movies, I could watch it over and over again.
B0068LYEHA|1.0|Caitlin Moran can write, at least when she's not hyperventilating or showing off.  Fact is, there's nothing here that hasn't been said before. And said better.  Perhaps what she has to say sounded fresher back in England.  Here British slang and \\"honesty\\" will take you only so far.  I've been making my way through this book over the course of two weeks. I'll say this for it: HOW TO BE A WOMAN makes for perfect bedtime reading.  Better than Ambien if you have trouble falling asleep.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|This DVD was bought as a Christmas gift. Although I cannot comment on the content of the DVD itself, it was delivered quickly and in great condition!
0802473156|4.0|I found this book to be so helpful in my current relationship. I especially liked that you can go to the website and take the test to find out what your love language is. I sent my results to my partner, not really thinking he would take it very seriously but he took the test too, and sent his results back to me and we talked about it. The Five Love Languages has really helped me to let go of my stubbornness and pay attention. I've learned that I just need to communicate in a language my partner can understand. It has made my life so much easier!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After the first couple of chapters I could not put it down! It was hard to get my work done around the house. I am anxious to start number 3.
