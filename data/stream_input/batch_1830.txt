B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is a fun twist on the original Angry Birds. I love playing it, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a fun game to play.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good.  Changeling.  Two things I don't like: Only one way to play. with there would be more options to play.  And I don't care for the advertisments popping up before each new 'play'.
B007SGM084|5.0|Not a romance reader, that's my daughter. But, I enjoyed the style of writing, and also the end when she switched to the male viewpoint. Nice twist. BTW, yes I am male, I am 63, no - not a pervert - maybe a little strange some time. DoC
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is the best I mean I use this for all my knifes it works best on 1to 7 inch blades but do not use for sharpening of blades that unused often for then you should. Get a big sharpener this is for thing u use everyday or two
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|My daughter likes this game but it is frustrating that you have to buy bling with real money. Ridiculous! I hate apps like this. And because you can't do much without bling it gets boring.
B001CTDH76|5.0|Exactly what I wanted and in excellent condition. This is probably the best show currently on TV if you like mystery and intrigue.
B0001US62I|5.0|ti was a good story it had mystery, suspense and surprise .it was well written  and beautifully shot check it out
B00006EXDM|5.0|What can you say about this collection?  The point about the Rolling Stones, it is the quality of their songs and the way they have recorded them - authentic and exciting - even after all these years.
B00992CF6W|4.0|man, this game is awesome, my sister has it and i have been trying to get money to buy it and it rocks as hard as diamond sword, but i wish in creative you had a flint and steel to light TNT to blow up, i mean really, i spent time building a gigantic tower 100 blocks high and i find out that you cant light it on fire!!! that might be the only bad thing but i wish they had mods for the pocket edition, i saw a bunch of YouTube of the left for dead 2 mod and i waste my money on that stupid mods elite, i mean wtf, what is wrong with that. but maybe i am speaking like it sucks, but hey, i am just warning you that the TNT on creative is unable to be triggered so amazon, if you are reading this complain to those Minecraft people that TNT wont blow in creative, also the creepers are really starting to get on my nerves they can suicide bomb me? i knew that but you should really lower the population on the creepers, and dont tell me to play on peaceful i am not a peaceful N00B! make TNT blow up in creative and lower the population of creepers so if you don't like mobs play on peaceful, you will find it in the options you N00BS.<br />so there you have it, people, if you like to blow stuff up or not have your stuff blown up, then this is not the app for you, becuase those creepers will keep in owning you!
1451683405|5.0|Sam Harris, respectably and colloquially known as one of the &#34;Horsemen&#34; (named so by the religious), has taken his turn on the argument of free will. A topic that has been the center of philosophical jousting for countless years and tackled by some of the most memorable names in history. Who better to have weigh in on the subject? One of the other &#34;Horsemen&#34;, Daniel Dennett, has addressed the topic himself many times (in detail in his 2003 book &#34;Freedom Evolves&#34;) and Harris' intepretation and conclusions are refreshing and somewhat light considering the topic itself tends to weigh so heavily in the larger subject of human behaviour.<br /><br />But what if free will really is an illusion? After all, as Harris points out, the thoughts that pop into your head do so with no prior control. Even in writing this review did I have free will or exercise free will? Well, one could say &#34;yes, you received an email asking you to review it.&#34; Well, fine. But the original idea was not mine. It was suggested to me. So very little of this review can be attributed to my free will. But let's take a look at a different time that was similar. A couple weeks back I sat down to make a spreadsheet for work. But as I sat down at my computer, facing a rapidly approaching deadline, I thought I should leave feedback on Amazon for the last order I received. Where did that thought come from? I hadn't just received my order. I did not get a reminder email. As a matter of fact this was the worst possible time for me to decide to rate a purchase I made. I literally had no control of how that thought was created or supplanted into my conscience mind. Now, I could exercise my free will at that point either to leave the feedback or not. But as far as original thought is concerned my free will is not present.<br /><br />Masterfully, that is the point that Harris makes in his essay on free will. For those who love free thought, Harris will burst your bubble by presenting the realization that the original thoughts you have are not free at all. Or are they? I didnt know I was going to type that last sentence until it popped into my head. And the same is true with that last one. And that last one. See? Its fun and a little bit of innocent trouble!
B0000009NG|5.0|Those are the lyrics for Lightning Frightening, one of the 'bonus' cuts on the 1990 Ryko reissue of DB's classic album, released originally in the states in the early 70s. It is sacrilege that these cool azz reissues are no longer availiable anywhere. Best songs here are : the title track, She Shook Me Cold, Width Of A Circle, Running Gun Blues. Another killer bonus cut is Hang On To Yourself issued by Bowie under the name Arnold Corns. The Ryko reissue of tmwstw is particularly worth tracking down, then again, if you come across any of the Ryko issued Bowie cd's from the 90's , I strongly advise that u snatch them right up because they have bonus cuts no longer availiable in the subsequent current edition.

0451228731|5.0|This is a great scifi book, even for scifi it is very creative and original plot, something I am always looking for in a book.  I hate reading the same old stuff<br /><br />It is based on technology available today, another great feature, since everyhting in the book can happen at least in part, another plus..<br /><br />Te book does use a lot of IT jargon, I think people who understand IT terminology would like it more
0307346617|5.0|This book is excellent as it stands on its own as good book outside of the horror genre. Entertaining, frightening and well-written.
B005EI86JU|5.0|If you read this book you can completely skip the Nikon manual (I read that first). This book goes more in-depth about every aspect of the camera and the advice is helpful. Highly recommended.

B00003CXXS|3.0|\\"Jurassic Park III\\" is a decent 2001 sequel, marginally better than 1997's \\"The Lost World.\\" It has a been-there-seen-that feel and lacks the huge suspense build-up of the 1993 original. Whereas \\"Jurassic Park\\" took a whole hour to get to the dino-action, this second sequel jumps to it in the first 15 minutes with a huge fight between a spinosaurus and a t-rex. Of course the former beats the latter to show the audience who's the baddest mofo on the island. (Incidentally, one dinosaur expert pointed out that, although the spino is larger than the t-rex, its head and maw aren't. In fact, the more slender and crocodilian shape of its head would make it virtually impossible to do what it does to the t-rex. Besides, the spino was basically a fish-eater).<br /><br />In addition to the spinosaurus, we are treated to a good pteranodon scene and another velociraptor sequence (but nowhere near as good as the original), not to mention brief scenes with brachiosaures and anklyosaures.<br /><br />The best part of the story is the return of Sam Neill as Dr. Grant and Laura Dern looks great in a cameo part, but the rest of the characters are weak and forgettable. In fact, the story is merely a clothesline that links the many dinosaur attack scenes in the jungle.<br /><br />At only 1 hour and 24 minutes (or thereabouts) before the credits role this is not a deep story with fleshed-out characters - flesh-eaten, maybe, but not fleshed-out. If you thought the original film had a weak story and characters, double that here. But the dinosaurs look great and the action sequences are thrilling. These may be worth the price of admission for some but, at the end of the day, \\"Jurassic Park III\\" is just really forgettable.<br /><br />GRADE: C
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was by far way better then I first imagined it would be a must read even for someone who does really like to read the story sucks you in to the very end.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|I became an instant &#34;RENT-head&#34; when I saw this movie.  So many aspects in this movie - the struggle for integrity and self-expression in a conformist culture, the struggle for survival as an artist in a setting of poverty, homelessness, drug addiction, and life-threatening disease (AIDS); the struggle to relearn trust after tragedy.  The songs are addictive too! - they run the gamut from joy and humor to tragedy and mourning to defiance and triumph.<br /> The second disc has a wonderful documentary about Jonathan Larson and how RENT came to be, along with scenes that weren't included in the final edit.<br />I recommend this movie for ANYONE over the age of 16.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book. It was a great story. Can't wait to read the last book. It was great to see goodness at the end of the book.

B000NDMRDW|1.0|Unwatchable because of constant buffering. Every 5 minutes for 5 minutes! Not a download at all but a bad streaming situation. No recourse, now I 'own' something I can't use.
0385535147|5.0|Another great book by John..Don't expect to get any work done while reading this one!! My mom will enjoy this one also
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I especially adored the 80s references! It was a book I couldnt put down and definitely felt like I was part of the Oasis!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Product just arrived yesterday. Absolutely wonderful from the package to the audio quality. I can not recommend this high enough.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|Not a Costner fan but this movie, the plot, the script, is just so good. Not an action movie, not a drama, not a comedy......just a really excellent story that I so wanted to believe. A most excellent date-night movie. If you have never seen this, put at the top of your list. Highly recommend!!
B0059XTU1S|1.0|About a decade ago, Peter Jackson concluded his film adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy and swept the awards with [[ASIN:B0039Q4FBW Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]].  Since then, Jackson has only had a couple of directing gigs, including his lackluster remake of the classic [[ASIN:B001Q7JD5O King Kong (Extended Version)]].  And only one piece of the LOTR saga remains for him to tap into.  Tolkien's novel [[ASIN:0618968636 The Hobbit]] isn't just a prequel chronologically.  Tolkien actually wrote and published it almost twenty years before what would be considered the first book of the LOTR trilogy.  While the books in the trilogy were epic fantasies that dug deep into the lore established by \\"The Hobbit\\", the prequel was a light-hearted romp, a first footstep into a Middle Earth still taking shape in Tolkien's imagination.  It was also a short romp, only a fraction of the length of any of the sequels.  So, while fans clamored for the Extended Cuts of Jackson's original trilogy a decade ago, eating up the scenes that couldn't make it into the three-hour theatrical cuts, there's not much excuse to turn \\"The Hobbit\\" into a trilogy of its own.<br /><br />The movie starts by bridging the gap between \\"The Hobbit\\" and LOTR by reintroducing  Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins.  Bilbo says he will now tell the story of his greatest adventure, and then spends several minutes relating the entire history of the dwarves to the audience before finally picking up where Tolkien chose to start, \\"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\\"  (Since the book was in third-person, and the movie adds a first-person narrator, the line now seems a little pretentious.)  And then, instead of diving into the story, Elijah Wood wastes a few minutes of screen time with a completely unnecessary cameo as Frodo.  Only then do we finally get to meet the young Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman, and reunite with Gandalf, played again by Ian McKellan.<br /><br />Martin Freeman has a talent for being the everyday man who is always agitated by everyone around him, from Arthur Dent in [[ASIN:B003QSJVGW The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] to Watson in [[ASIN:B004132HZS Sherlock: Season One]].  And playing homebody Bilbo gives him a great opportunity to roll his eyes and look perplexed by the 12-dwarf army he finds himself surrounded by.  We meet each dwarf as they barge, one at a time, through Bilbo's front door, and then insist on singing an uninspired musical number for about two minutes as they wash Bilbo's dishes.  When it's not dwarves, it's the McKellen, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, or Christopher Lee characters from Jacksons' earlier trilogy pushing Freeman's Hobbit to the background.  Instead of showing the same reverence to the source material that made Jackson's earlier trilogy so successful, here he ignores Tolkien's main plot and instead pads the movie with a subplot involving Radagast the Brown, a character taken from elsewhere in Tolkien's writings who has no place in \\"The Hobbit\\", and a Necromancer, and another one involving an albino orc pursuing the dwarf leader, in order to give the new trilogy a central antagonist.  Where the novel was all about Bilbo's surprising resourcefulness, more emphasis is placed on sword and axe clashes between the dwarves and the orcs.<br /><br />Also, most of the light-heartedness of the novel has been leached out in favor of making the movie feel more like an extension of the original trilogy.  While the movie is brighter and more colorful then the previous films, this just has the surprising effect of making the movie feel like one of those sequels the original director palmed off to someone else after he lost interest in the franchise, even though Jackson is still at the helm.  There are some weak attempts at humor, but rather than Tolkien's wit, the biggest laughs come from unintentional comedy from the terrible acting and writing (disappointing, since one of the co-writers this time isGuillermo del Toro, who's better than this) behind lines like \\"Where there is sickness, bad things happen\\" or \\"If there's a key, there's a door.\\"<br /><br />Like the previous trilogy, most of the visuals are a cross between New Zealand landscapes and CGI special effects.  Peter Jackson makes the same mistake he did with \\"King Kong\\", assuming the computer-heavy effects are as impressive now as they were the first time we saw them in LOTR.  Even the rain is disappointingly animated, noticeably leaving all of the actor's faces completely dry.  There is one scene worth raving about, a riddle contest between Bilbo and Gollum in a dark pit.  Not only does Andy Serkis, through voice work and motion capture, remind us that he should have won an Academy Award for the role he's still great at, but the scene finally gives Martin Freeman a moment to shine.  Considering they decided to tell the story through Bilbo's perspective, it's surprising that this is the one scene that really gives the title character a central role.<br /><br />At the risk of sounding like one of those snobs who always complains that the book is better, in the time it will take to watch what is sure to be a 9-hour trilogy, you could probably read Tolkien's entire book, and be much more entertained doing so.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|No idea what to expect but delighted with what I got. Quirky, funny, touching, this movie would be an excellent date night rental. Great characters in various touching situations. No, no car crashes, gun fire but it is really good for what it is. Recommend highly.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I read this book in little under a week. It was very good and really made you think about your life and the lives of others.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|This movie is a must see for any one who loves science fiction and action. From beginning to end, it provides it all and even when the movie is over, there is plenty to think about. Can be viewed many times, which is saying something in itself. Just most excellent. Highly recommend.
B005IU1OMA|4.0|This DVD is a wide camera angled, high definition footage that makes all the money they spent snowboarding wild slopes on arctic mountain ranges all worth the money, they should've sent me a Red Bull with the package while they were at it. The DVD case should have been sealable or with a locking device, as I fear my advertisement slips and DVD/ Blu- ray disc will fall out and become damaged. The music iconic geographic ranges are what eclipsed me to purchase this movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love God and I love the Bible so very much.  thank you YouVersion for making a really good Bible app that's great for all ages and keeps them into God's word
B000K7VHPU|5.0|I bought this based on a friend's recommendation. It has great acting, as expected, but it moved along a little slowly for my taste. The ending made up for all of it though:)

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Good way to get the word in on the run. Simple interface to use and even gives you alarms to keep you on track.
B0080R5SV6|4.0|I was satisfied with basically everything. The book was in very good condition. the only problem was that the cover was that the cover was a little rough, but it was definitely worth what I paid. Other than that the book itself is a good read and I recommend it.
B008NABUU8|3.0|i baby sit and am always finding way to entertain the kids, the absolutely love this game and i love the free time it creates!!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I liked the game but some of the mini games need better instructions. The story line was not bad either though it did end abruptly in my opinion.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|If you've written a novel and you're in the editing stage, it helps to see the book in a different format and to also hear it read aloud. True, the mechanical voice is awful, but you can learn to listen around it for word repitions and pacing. And it's great for correcting errors on the go. You can paste post its, add text boxes,  highlight, underscore, strike through. It took me awhile to get used to it, because there are no instructions. But if you fiddle with it, it's a great tool.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We used this CD to encourage parents to register by the deadline. In 2011, one or two parents registered on time, giving us a huge headache.

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Her best yet.  These are some of the greatest songs from the stage and beautifully rendered.  The duos with Michael Crawford and Donny Osmond are outstanding.  I have bought each Susan Boyle album that Amazon has offered.  The quality of the music and voices are outstanding.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This is something that I thought that it didn't exist. As soon as I saw it I buy it. I recommend this product without a doubt.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I found the product recently after purchasing some mp3s on Amazon, and the cloud server relationshipis fantastic! I like a lot of music and with my previous relationships with devices and porting my digital collections, I have had some consistant issues. This product is an awesome way for me to have access to my stored collections anytime anywhere a device is available, I highly recommend it, especially if you have ever bought the same song two or three times.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This app is in my opinion not as good as Bakery Story, but enjoyable. The decorating features are cool. It lets you make differnet foods like BBQ and I love how there are different ovens to choose from. Everytime you go up about two levels, you get your pick of one oven so choose carefully otherwise, you might be stuck with an oven that needs parts.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I really like this game it is so much like the show the pets are so cute u give five stars
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I think this app is better than Angry Birds! It takes a lot of skill and practice and it's super fun! I love it! This game makes you think through how you're going to roll the pig (or shoot or bomb) to the finish line with the available tools. Its very well made. For all ages who love strategic games.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I didnt have a chance to see them live, but I did see celebration day in theaters and Im so glad I got to&#34; bringing it on home&#34;<br />Very cool to see them again. Jason Bonham rocked in his fathers foot steps. Have to own if your a die hard Zeppelin fan like me.
0385528752|5.0|I recently decided to start an online business, but so overwhelmed by everything from having my friends tell me I was wasting my time to having to learn how to set up an online shopping cart. I had read an interview with the authors of this book and felt what they had to say was exactly what I needed to help me move forward. This book, I can honestly say, helped me more than any other resource. It wasn't so much about completing a bunch of tasks as it is about changing the way I approach things--to let go of the way that has been branded in my brain for years and to open up to taking small steps to bigger change.<br /><br />After reading this book, I feel free. I feel like I can not only move my business idea forward, but that I can do it on my own turns and find a create way around any obstacles that come up.<br /><br />Thank you for writing this book.

1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements, a Toltec Wisdom Book presents a strong foundation for living a life of your own choosing. All four agreements are sound advice. The third agreement \\"don't make assumptions\\" is a potent tool for living in the moment, whereby you leave your past judgments behind and experience life directly, moment to moment. I especially found the fourth agreement \\"don't take anything personally\\" to be very freeing. I started to pay attention to how much I was taking other people's words or ways of being personally without investigating where the words or actions were coming from. I found I had more energy and incentive to be responsible for my own words and actions and not for those of others around me.<br />Another book I highly suggest reading is called \\"WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. While The Four Agreements presents rules or guidelines for living your life, the Kanes present a way of being in your life. Their approach is based on the premise that through listening and simple, non judgmental awareness, you can lead a meaningful and enriching life instantaneously. And it works!<br /><br />Both of these books are great sources for creating your own heavenly life here on earth.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|About half way through this book, I was saying to myself, ,\\"So many good anecdotes, so many good points!\\" Then I said to myself, \\"Of course YOU think so, you're an introverted yourself; you scored 17 out of 20 yeses on the introvert survey in the beginning of the book.<br />Which raises an interesting problem: extroverts will probably never read this book, and that's too bad. The HBS grads won't read it (they'll TALK about it, for sure, as if they've read it, especially if it becomes an \\"in\\"book among the Masters of the Universe.)<br />The sad truth is that the introverts only are the ones with a predisposition to care about such matters, and maybe understand why they could save us from another financial collapse, another misguided war, or another broken family, ravaged by an unchecked ego.<br />We like most who we see in the mirror, after all, and don't pay much attention to a face we don't recognize.
0316010669|5.0|Blink is a \\" must read \\" about the power and accuracy of our first impressions and intuitions about people and events. Malcolm Gladwell skillfully presents several case studies that inspire me to recognize my own intuitive talent and also to notice my tendencies to dismiss my intuitive knowing in favor of analysis and self-doubt.<br />He cleverly examines stereotyping and predjudice, and demonstrates how this influences and distorts our intuition.<br />As a result of this book, I feel more confident and freer to express myself spontaneously! Tuning in to my first impressions is fun and actually gives me a greater sense of well-being and living in the moment, wow!<br />Another great source of well-being and Instantaneous Transformation is Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment by Ariel and Shya Kane. This lovely anthology gives me a window into living with ease and transforms everyday circumstances into life giving opportunities. I can experience enlightenment now! Without any complicated discipline, Guru, or hoops to jump through. Thanks to the Kanes and Gladwell for giving us modern day access to a truly satisfying life.

1400069289|5.0|Once again the American publishing industry pushes out a too-long book that would have easily been a nine-page essay in the Atlantic monthly. Rather than an expert in the field, again we have a journalist who compiles a bunch of facts and stories and massages it into the standard creative-writing-program story-expand narrative framework. The book is big on promise, short on execution, and dishonest in exposition.<br /><br />The first part concerns some basic behavior psychology with a focus on the Cue-Routine-Reward cycle. This is somehow the miraculous discovery that will change your life. However, the book is so bereft of application for individual users, that you end of reading a bunch of nice stories about how other people changed, but still lack any methodology about how to apply it to yourself other than asking, \\"Hey, what are your cues?\\", \\"What reward does your habit give?\\".<br /><br />The author is exceedingly dishonest in trying to massage Paul O'Neil's turn-around of Alcoa into an example of habit forming. It is an excellent example of expertise in organizational behavior, however it is only tangentially related to habit formation. Habit formation of individuals is a neurological mechanism, habit formation is organizations is a multi-factor process dealing with organizational structure, power sharing, organizational goals, and individual management styles, thus the author is disingenuous when he links the two \\"habits\\" through equivocation.

1577314808|5.0|You've heard the old maxim that there is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come. That's what The Power of Now represents to me. I have been in the book business all my adult life and consider myself somewhat jaded when it comes to books on self-help, gurus or enlightenment manuals. In fact, I almost never read them. There is something unique about The Power of Now that makes it stand out in an otherwise crowded field. It may be the clarity of the language, the absence of technical language, or more likely, the fact the author is clearly writing about a place the he authentically inhabits; and that my friends, is rare indeed. When describing this book to others, I compare the concepts and practices to the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, and to the Dzogchen teachings of Tibetan Buddhism, as well as the core instructions of such Zen Masters as Dogen and Hongzhi. The thing that makes this book so magical is that you get all that pith instruction without having to wade through cultural artiface or the barriers of religiosity. This is only the second review I've written, and I'm doing it because I believe this book is fundamentally important. The teachings have had an immediate impact on my life in a way that few books ever have. I agree with the editorial review - within a chapter of reading this book, I was already holding the world in a different container. This is the real deal.

My only discrepancy (at least with Dark Knight Rises; haven't watched the other two yet) is that it constantly switches from standard widescreen to extra widescreen (don't know the actual term for it).  It's just kinda weird to watch the screen format change throughout the whole movie.  Then again, none of my friends noticed it until I pointed it out, so I guess not everyone really notices it. :P  Either way, don't pass this up.
0345472322|5.0|The text as written certainly succeeds with many. In my case, I got the message after 3 or 4 repeats of the 'growth mindset can do it' theme. As story after story repeats the same theme, which is a good message, I began wondering when some background exploration would begin. It never happened.<br /><br />I've read other works by Dweck. She plays the role of editor in the recent \\"Handbook of Competence and Motivation\\" (in this book the two mindsets are called 'fixed' and 'incremental'). It is very academic and technical, but a treasure trove of insights. I liked it so much I'm going through it again with a fine tooth comb. I'd check Mindsets out at a bookstore or library. If you find yourself wanting more, take a look at Dweck's other books.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is the best book I have read this year!  I can't wait to pass it on.  This book can't stay on a shelf.  It must be passed on ....I don't know how many times I laughed ...cried...and WONDERED.  It could be THE message that everyone can learn from no matter your age.  Please don't miss this.  This is sooo worth the read.<br /><br />I realize that some people will not enjoy the other character's perspective.  But, I think that it was important to the story.  August's side of the story was my favorite, but it was nice to see his family and friend's side too.<br /><br />I really loved the English teacher's assignment.  I want to copy it :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is miraculous! that means amazing! I love it! the only bad thing is that if u make a world and u decide to make another world then u cant open up ur 1st world.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|I actually bought this movie before seeing it. The only recommendation was the review at Asian Cult Cinema. It's definitely worth it! This movie re-defines action for another generation! The best new action film since the first Ong Bak! Get it! You won't regret it!!
B0087HT36U|5.0|other than needing to see a walkthru or get a hit here and there i love it. can we get a WWII version? either way hurry up and update!
B009H2PCNC|5.0|Lux has a sound that goes back to the origin of Ambient music; when I first heard Discreet Music, the Music for Airports in the 70's, I was floored, it was great. It can take a person to a heightened state of peace. Lux is what I've been waiting for since Thursday Afternoon. It's using sound and silence a little differently though, refreshing and fantastic.
B00006ZXSK|3.0|I loved the moovie.  The bad thing was that it wasn't in the promised shape so I felt dissapointed when I received it :(
B001F12J48|4.0|After reading all of the other positive ratings we could not wait for this to arrive. It is one of our favorite holiday movies! Our family had mixed reviews on the 3D effects. The red /blue glasses are really hard to adjust to. We had to really work with the brightness, contrast and sharpness settings on our TV. In the end my youngest daughter and I adjusted to the glasses and the 3D was wonderful! For my husband and oldest daughter, the 3D never worked quite right and was very disappointing.  A 3D version made for a 3D TV with regular glasses would be so much better.  I am not usually a huge 3D fan but the effects in this movie are worth it!
0060763280|5.0|Absolutely loved the ideas presented here.  Really focuses on how millionaires think instead of pitching you on some business scheme or the newest online business fad.  Highly recommended for anyone who has the desire to become wealthy.
6305428387|4.0|My husband loves it too! Great price for a Disney production so no complaints here. I? was just glad to be able to get it in time for Christmas
1451648537|4.0|I had heard many stories and read much about Steve Jobs and the thought of reading a biography which he himself had \\"authorized\\" was an interesting prospect. Friends of mine also knew him very well and he would be at their house every week for something to eat and the opportunity to talk. He was, it seems, for all his other foibles, a very good friend (at least for friends outside of the business he was in) keeping this part of his life free of the angst, chaos, confusion and anger he could introduce into the lives of his colleagues. He also enjoyed eating with my friends, giving another take on his nutritional beliefs, complexities and hangups which feature greatly in the book.<br /><br />Within a comparatively few pages also, I had a case of \\"déjà vu\\": my first major job in the corporate world in Australia, introduced me to a boss whose similarities with Steve Jobs were virtually a mirror-image. He was driven, enthusiastic, passionate about things and projects; totally self-centered; at times, totally insufferable; paranoid; mercurial - in fact, the list of similar \\"negatives\\" went on ad infinitum. He could swear one moment that white was white, then it was black, then grey, the purple, then, having confused and upset many, admit he was wrong and that white was indeed white; he loved ideas - often triggered by something seen or heard - and thought them up, conjured them up and re-engineered them continually, thinking nothing of an excited telephone call at late or early hours most would describe as \\"ill-considered timing\\" because they would in all probability be asleep. He was a hard task master but also, by endless example, one learned much about how to do things best and equally how not to do things. It was a master-servant relationship but, he appreciated talent and creativity and nurtured it because the talent of others helped create the vision he had of product and service perfection as well as adding those missing dimensions he himself required for a morecomplete picture. He was like a conductor of capabilities; a chef bringing it all into an exciting new recipe to which others became addicted.<br /><br />Our working relationship survived 11 years and, like those who worked with Jobs, one learned not to be offended at stolen ideas. Whatever went into his head and re-emerged WAS his idea although at times when one least expected it, a public compliment would be given. So, as with those colleagues sharing \\"Life with Steve\\", for me, it was an exciting and often unpredictable roller-coaster ride and certainly no tranquil, boring backwater. Like Jobs, my former boss believed in creating the future and that people didn't really know what they wanted or preferred until you gave it to them. Thus, asking their opinions before the event was a pointless exercise. Marketing the message and the product was far more important and these had first to be created!<br /><br />So, the book for me was an unfurling of much about a person driven and impassioned but who also, I think, believed in karma. I provides cause for reflection, given the ultimate outcomes of his life. One develops a certain sympathy for those who were chewed up and spat out during the entire process. Jobs could be dictatorial, brutal, vicious and ruthless as well as totally unpredictable. His views on design and production often meant huge costs, particularly (and as often happened) he changed his mind. But, the book also provides a journey of discovery as the Jobs vision for computers and revolutionary consumer electronics and his battles with other competing companies, take center-stage. Over time also, especially as Jobs starts to mellow and with the onset of his cancer, the obnoxious, hard-nosed, apparently immune-from-all-evil attitude starts to show a more human face. For all the bravado too, and, remembering that in spite of all he was a multi-millionaire in his early twenties, when he was ousted from Apple and had a time in the wilderness with NEXT and other ventures, over time he began to learn from his mistakes. Being an ideas man and visionary is all very well but, one also needs practical and technical heads to make it all happen. So, by the time Apple had become a basket case on the verge of insolvency, he alone had the capacity to rescue it. This, he did, a most remarkable turnaround, to create the world's most valued brand. The impacts of his vision affected computers to be sure but more importantly, mobile telephone technology; film, music and  videos and how they are marketed as well as enjoyed on mobile devices; communications and also of course, flagship marketing in signature stores which are at once a design statement as well as a total experience. Every Apple store I have ever been into all over the world has been almost standing room only. There is thus a total mystique but also a reality, an experience.<br /><br />The book sees a much softer and more attractive Jobs emerge towards the end, in spite of some technical problems with the iPhone 4 and one sees a more subdued Jobs on a gradual and not-too-pleasant pathway into the valley of death. Somewhat oddly, however, the book ends in denial of his death, at least denial by omission. It is almost as is there is an anticipated second coming. Once Jobs gets heaven and hell sorted out he will come back to earth.
B000P0J0EW|4.0|Too bad I found out we already owned it after the package arrived. Either way though it will make for a great gift for someone else.
0385344333|5.0|A great  novel, I'll be re-reading it shortly.  But surely you jest, Hollywood, casting Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher?  Really?
B006LSZECO|1.0|If you like to read about two self-centered, egotistical snots then this is the book for you. I quit reading it because the characters were so unlikeable. Sure am glad I didn't buy it.
B000LC55F2|5.0|&#34;The Prestige&#34; is a masterpiece!  If you don't like dark films, then it's not for you...but then again, if you don't like dark films Christopher Nolan is probably not for you.<br /><br />However, if you're a lover of cinema, or you just love a good story, then this film is something you absolutely cannot pass up.  Christopher Nolan lives up to, and exceeds, his reputation as one of today's most talented directors...you will not be disappointed!
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|We don't get that many good scifi or fantasy movies each year.  I thought this one was well worth the purchase.  I saw the original and enjoyed this so much more.  Not sure what all the complaints are about.  The special effects are good, as well as the visualization of a future world situation.  2 thumbs up in my book.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Again, another excellent movie from Christopher Nolan, but unless you happen to be paying a lot of attention to each scene you're likely to become confused during your first viewing.  It's definitely a film that requires at least two viewings to fully understand the film's meanings.  If you're a fan of Christopher Nolan's other convoluted films, then this one is definitely something that deserves your consideration.  On the other hand, if you enjoy simple plots and characters, then this is definitely not the movie for you.<br /><br />On a side note, there's an option on the DVD to view the movie's events in chronological order, but please do yourself a favor and forget about the option...or just don't use it till you've watched the movie at least once.  Nolan uses the narrative structure and editing to mimic Leonard's condition, and that disorientation you feel when first watching the film helps to further immerse yourself in the story.
B0085YNML2|1.0|This app looked fun, however it does not load on my Motorola Defy. What a disappointment. It's good it was faotd.
B009ZE27US|4.0|I loved this app. I read the description so I knew it was a guessing game. it was fun to do with my co workers.
0307346617|5.0|Amazing book! Great read, very well written and keeps you glued to it wanting more. I didn't want it to end!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have this app on both my kindle fire and smart phone. I love it: two options for note taking (list which you can strike out items as you get them at the store, etc, as well as a typical notepad) and it has never crashed. What else could you ask for?
B0083SBMBM|5.0|My son is a very big fan of the Avengers.  We bought this movie for him so he can watch it over and over again.  Great movie.
B008FOB124|5.0|Anastasis was my first experience into the DCD world. I was able to attend to they live performance in Mexico City, and it was a magical experience!
030746363X|3.0|I enjoy reading Tim Ferris.  The 4 Hour Work Week was especially good.  I tried many of his suggestions on The 4-hour Body, and came to the realization that the content is definitely for a younger man.  I'm in very good shape for my age (late 40s), but I think that this book applies more to folks in Tim's age group.  Some great insight, however, but I think that Tim may be a better book salesman than an actual personal trainer.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|After reading all of the reviews before I purchased this box set, I was a little concerned as to whether I would receive this box set in top condition. I already own the Stereo and Mono CD 2009 Remasters and also the Australian pressings from the 70's and 80's.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this box set was incorrectly sent from the US to Germany, not Australia which is where I live. This took an extra 2 weeks as a result and I was worried the box set would have taken a beating in the post but the only issue was the left corners were a little damaged but nothing I was overly concerned about as you need to look at it closely to notice it.<br /><br />Upon opening the box set, I was very impressed with the book which is absolutely beautiful and a must for any Beatles fan. The pictures are stunning and many of these have never been released previously.<br />I love the way the artwork of the LP's replicate the orginal UK pressings which in my opinion have always been the definitive pressings, not the US ones.<br /><br />After playing through all the LP's up until Sgt Peppers, they all sounded great. Lots of warmth as would expect with vinyl and they sound much better than the CD remasters. With Sgt Peppers however, I started playing this and the first thing I noticed was this sounded very distorted throughout which was really disappointing given this is one of their masterpieces.<br />I was hoping this was going to be the only defect and luckily it was after I finished playing the remainder LP's. I'd heard there were alot of issues with Peppers and Abbey Road but luckily my Abbey Road plays really well.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon who gave me an email address to contact EMI where I have requested a replacement for Sgt Peppers and they advised me the next day that they had already sent this out so I'm hoping to receive it this week, providing it doesn't ship to Germany again by mistake LOL!<br /><br />Apart from the Sgt Peppers defect, I am very happy with the sound qualityof these new vinyls.<br />I think they sound great and would highly recommend them to any Beatles enthusiest.<br /><br />But I have only given 4 stars due to the Sgt Peppers defect and for the shipping which I believe should have been packed more securely.
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|Selma was the only reason I give it 2 stars.  There are Countless reasons why this movie sucks and with the caliber of stars in this epic piece of junk I would have the blame the editor.  Can't fathom that any of the actors would cosign on this garbage. I lost 2 hours of my life that I can never get back, I just kept watching hoping it would get better but it did not, kinda like Catwoman.  Can someone please tell Blake to take the cotton balls out of her mouth, I could barely understand what she was saying in the movie just as on Gossip Girl.  The trailer looked awesome, so thankful I didn't waste $ and go to the movies for this one.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I had this movie before on DVD but it got lost. So when I saw the special edition out I had to have it. It arrived in great condition and I love the fact I was able to get it in black and white plus a color version too. Another must watch for the holidays.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This is a really fun game. So far it is my favorite hidden object game. I like the fact that there is a timer so it isn't too easy.
B002MU4NLI|3.0|I love this movie for the holiday season, and that I got it in black and white along with color. I am just a little disappointed that the packaging was a little beat up. I had wanted the special case for display.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Loved it for what it is.  One great, maybe final show.  I'm not into old classic bands beating a dead horse and replacement members.  So this was done great and with class.  Some noticable key changes but the older you get the voice just doesn't work the same.  Plant sang great and all played great.  Not to sure about some of Pages changes because I'm so used to the original but still very good.
B005F3XV62|4.0|Got this for a christmas gift for a friend. It came in good condition. The movie its self wasn't as funny as the previews made you believe.
B009A9EQL6|2.0|I agree there are alot of old style Aerosmith sounds, playing styles and melodies.  But it seems disconnected.  I hated Just Push Play and though this is far better it's still down towards the bottom of my Aerosmith collection.  Probably 4 quality top noch songs, the rest are filler to me.  After 10+ years we deserve better.  Hopefully next time.
1416960953|5.0|I got this for christmas last year for my sister. The book came in great condition and she loves the story.
B008N5UX9M|1.0|This is tough.  I really wish this was never released.  I really tried to like this but after about 5 lisitenings I hust can't do it.  The singers voice to me just doesn't work.  I found it not very creative and very limited.  A positive thing is....a cool cover?
0307592731|1.0|It is full of far fetched stories w no uplifting or educational value. A lot of the stuff are total fabrication and fictional. Do not recommend it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is an awesome app. I love it for when I'm trying to waste some time...I love it! definitely worth the 99 cents.
030758836X|5.0|More than Tom Wolfe's BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES, which used to hold my prize for THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL, Gillian Flynn has re-produced America in dramatic and enjoyable fiction -- crumbled marriages, insane tribal conventions, a truly sick media, and a system of justice that defies logic and the law. In exceptional language and gut wrenching insight, Flynn has created characters that mirror everything wrong with our world, our lives, and our relationships. The people who detested this book are the people who created it -- sick, stupid, and savage -- for GONE GIRL is nothing if not a mirror. Look deep inside the glass, people. We're all there. What a read!<br /><br />I'm going back for her other books, and will purchase everything she ever writes. Wow!
B004I8WD6E|3.0|I'm clumsy, so when I got an iPhone I knew I had to get a good case for it. This one is nice because it is made of a soft plastic that (theoretically) could absorb some of the impact if/when the phone is dropped and the case won't crack. Plus, the edges come up over the front of the phone to protect the glass so you won't scratch the face of your phone if you put it face down on a table. The phone really does feel safe and secure in the case. I wasn't able to put the screen protector on without getting bubbles, so I'm not using one at the moment. The only problem is that the case is fairly bulky and the back edges of the case aren't rounded, so they dig into your hand a bit.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|brand new - came wrapped up and everything unopened. and all the dvds work wonderfully without a single scratch on them!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I needed a solid knife to add to my camping gear,...so I read and watched many reviews on the Ka-Bar Becker BK2 Campanion Fixed Blade Knife .<br />I liked what I saw and bought it and have used it several times. The blade is massive and holds an edge very well,...the Kydex sheath is awesome and allowed me to attach a small pouch to carry a fire steel and a diamond hone.<br />Just a great solid knife
B003L77GH4|5.0|brand new - came wrapped up and everything unopened. and all the dvds work wonderfully without a single scratch on them!
B004HO6I2O|3.0|I was hoping for more samples of Ryan Reynolds life before the change (namely, he didnt hook up with a single girl before the change). After the change, I was surprised that **spoiler alert** Tatiana was pregnant. Even though she was still pretty, it really kind of gave the other guy in his body an easy way out. It would have been more of a challenge if she was a super trimmed super model with no one inside her womb.
0743244257|1.0|I did not understand it.  I looked on the internet and there were many negative comentaries, the readers did not understand either. It is absurd text.
B005HSL626|3.0|I like it but they always have ads which makes the screen freezes and the time you play its been 5 minutes buy over all its pretty good
1451695195|5.0|The topic is fascinating and this book was so well written.  It describes his journey to heaven and offers definitive proof of it's existence.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Exactly what I'd hoped for - perfect for my two-and-a-half year old :) I couldn't be happier. Thank you so much.
B00571F26Y|2.0|The author *way* overextends and makes specious connections between wheat and every malady under the Sun. If you walked into his office and told him you had brain cancer he'd probably suggest you stop eating wheat. Yes, wheat causes issues, but avoiding it is not a panacea.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is spent on lengthy passages of scientific (and pseudoscientific) evidence linking wheat to every common disease. That's great if you're trying to build an academic case but it is simply too much for a pop book...which the book clearly is since the inclusion of the word \\"belly\\" in the title is marketing to a diet fad demographic. The repeated case studies of the author's own patients are always careful to include the weight lost as a data point, even if the preceding chapter had nothing to do with weight loss. Patient had crippling arthritis and LOST 20 POUNDS! Patient had lupus and LOST 34 POUNDS! Just terrible.<br /><br />So, nothing really new here: Want to lose weight? Go low-carb.<br /><br />If you want to read explanations of chemical processes *possibly* connecting wheat ingestion to every malady out there, then you might enjoy reading this.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|If you hate the Muppets, or Christmas, or Dickens, this is not for you. Just about everyone else should enjoy this a lot. Somewhere in the special features I think they call this the most literal version, which it may be, because they stage it in a way that uses a narrator. So, you also get the benefit of hearing more of Dickens' language. It's a great way for kids to see Christmas Carol, and a pretty good way for adults, too.<br />  As an added plus, they feature a light-hearted but useful on-screen warning before the ghost of Christmas yet-to-come scenes, giving a nice heads-up if you're watching with small children who might want to clear out for the scary parts (not that scary, of course, but would've frightened the bejeebers out of me when I was 5).<br />  Poignant in a way as well, as Jim Henson had passed away only a year or so before they began working on the movie, so it was their first major project without him. They did him proud.
0312427999|3.0|I suppose Ms. Klein could have blamed the civil wars in the \\"Southern Cone\\" on General Franco.<br />When Jews fled into Spain in 1940, Franco refused demands by the Nazis that they be turned over.<br />Franco saved more Jews than any other leader except Stalin.However, at the end of WWII he asked<br />the Jewish refugees to leave, remembering all the Jewish leaders in the International Brigades and<br />the commissars who ran the Catholic killing Chekas. Some went to Palestine, but many went to the more developed countries<br />of Latin Ameerica. They took their politics with them and inculcated these into their children.<br />These politics were generally Marxist. When Ms. Klein wonders why so many of the leftist revolutionaries<br />in the Southern Cone were in their early 30s, the demographics of the Jewish Diaspora into Latin America<br />explains a lot. The Red Brigades in the Southern Cone were a real problem. I remember not going to<br />an international oncology conference in Buenos Airies in the early 70s because of the record of kidnappings<br />and ransome there. Like Franco before him, Pinochet resisted taking part in a coup. But the horrors of the<br />chekas were already evident, and he did what he had to do to save his country from becoming an anti-Catholic<br />Marxist sewer. Galtieri in Argentina had much the same motivaation. His revolution was quashed by the<br />imperialist Margaret Thatcher who wanted to hold onto the Malvinas islands at all cost. Pinochet's biggest<br />mistake was in allowing the British SAS to use Chile as a staging platform from which they destroyed three<br />Argentinian Exocet missiles.With those Exocet missles, the Brits would have lost their aircraft carrier and<br />had to turn the fleet back to Britain. Chile has the highest GDP in Latin America, due in large measure to the ideas of the \\"Chicago boys\\". I suppose Ms. Klein does not accuse Milton Friedman of being an anti-Semite, given his origins.<br />Think of Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War and you will get a good idea about what the Southern Cone might have become without the intervention of the military.  Ms. Klein's ideology blinds her to reality.<br /><br />However,though flawed in the Latin American context, Ms. Klein rightly describes Jeffrey Sachs's performance in Poland. I was in Poland on sabbatical trying to introduce the relatively inexpensive<br />Deming paradigm of quality improvement.I had a grant from UNIDO (nothing for myself), and I trained and<br />hired 10 Polish professors to go into ten companies and implement the Deming paradigm. Deming understood that the assets of a company include the skills of its workforce. Sachs saw to it that Poland got essentially no support to solve the poison pill problem introduced by the Soviets. Few Polish companies<br />built all their parts. These came in significant measure from Russia and the other Communist block countries.Poland needed to buy their suppliers or duplicate their products. Russia would accept Polish<br />products but refused to pay for them. Sachs, as a Jewish intellectual, never walked the production floor<br />as I have always done. He had clean finger nails and no empathy with the workers. His failure to gain<br />for Poland any significant bridge capital and his demand that all companies be sold for pennies on the dollar to Post Communist oligarchs (with capital arranged from private New York sources) succeeded in shutting down<br />95% of Poland's industry. The brave miners of Wujek lost their jobs. Worse, many towns in Poland had<br />only one factory. When it shut down, skilled workers were transformed into unemployed rural poor, trying<br />to eke out an existence from small family crop plots (Poland still had private agriculture in the Communist times) To become a master tool and dye maker requires around 8 years of training and apprenticeship. These people Sachs and the PostCommunist Balserowicz and the former head of the Komosmol, Jacek Kuron, destroyed<br />together with their families. 95% of Polish factories shut down completely. The poverty situation in Poland is still desperate 20 years after Sachs. Friedman was not a criminal. Sachs certainly was. \\"Commanding Heights\\" is little more than neocon Jewish hubris. If you destroy nations and expect to be rewarded for<br />doins so, you are no better than a Soviet commissar. That describes Sachs very well. A monstrous thought that he is a neocon hero. The neocons combine the worst characteristics of the Communists and the Nazis.
B007SGM084|5.0|I really don't care what anyone says... this trilogy was amazing. I fell in love with the romance before the sex scenes. After a while the sex scenes became repetitive, but I did enjoy every part of the book.<br /><br />Although Grey seems so dominant, Ana is the one in control. She is one lucky woman for sure!!! LOL<br /><br />My favorite of the three is the second half of 2 and the ending of 3.  I am definitely greyssessed and it has possessed and obssessed me!! HAHAHA<br /><br />My all time favorite part of the book is when Christian actually proposes to her at his parents home... It was so initmate and romantic I melted!!! &#34;You wanted hearts and flowers...&#34; He says... &#34;You have my heart... and here are the flowers&#34; (not exactly like that but definitely something like that). I have a lot of favorite parts of the three part book. It took me 5 days to read the book and I am almost done reading it for the 3rd time. I go back and forth to that book and other books right now. I absolutely LOVE the characters and can't wait to see it live on screen... although I am not sure the producers can pull this movie off for all of the die hard fans!! (LIKE ME)<br /><br />I want more... so much more from these 3 books... I want the story to keep going... Their lives are so interesting and I want to know how their life turns out even further down the line!! We aim to please and LATERS BABY has become so catchy... I love it!!!
B004BLDD9Y|3.0|Seriously, if you get one of the ones that work, it will make your room brighter, use less electricity, and look great for filming,
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Oh boy the trilogy was an amazing read!!! I loved the suspense in the book and the crazy scenes it plays out. The movie inspired me to read the books... I heard about the books and didn't think to read them until the movie came out. I didn't watch the movie until after I read the books. Happy reading!!!

B00008PX8P|4.0|I read a great review for this in Rolling Stone. It's probably really good, but I'm less inclined to enjoy such things now. The music is good and it goes well with a spleef. But I probably wouldn't watch this as often as I have Rattle And Hum from U2 which actually incorporates various venues of a tour and moments in the studio with B.B. King and a number done with a Harlem choir. I do particularly enjoy watching and listening to Jimmy Page play his guitar. For that reason, I'd strongly recommend the video he did with The Edge and Jack White called It Might Get Loud.

B009B8YZKS|5.0|I havent played Halo since Halo 2 after realizing how much i sucked at multiplayer, BUT that did not mean i hated Halo altogether. I am a HUGE scifi fan, and James Cameron's Aliens remains one of my top scifi movies. Its so simple to see how Aliens have influenced Halo itself, such as Cryo sleep chambers, Vehicle designs, marines, and weapons. Im not a tough critic and i can appreciate all sorts of films. For instance Last Airbender was a horrible movie, because of the horrible director.  When i first saw the trailer for this on itunes, i was very impressed and after reading the reviews, I decided to go and get a copy on BluRay. This movie looks and sounds amazing. The effects are decent, as well as the acting! You have a sense that you are in this Halo universe, and thats a pretty awesome feeling to feel immersed in a film. I think the director did a great job, and props to 343 Studios for everything else. I highly recommend this to any SciFi fan, and to any Halo fan this is a MUST OWN.

B0085YNML2|4.0|Munch time is a very cute and interesting game. I can't say it's my absolute favorite, but it's a great &quot;time passer&quot; The character is adorable and so are it's surrounding worlds. I reccomend the game for awoken and kids; the game is a bit girly.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Be prepared for a VERY long sitting,  But definitely worth every minute. This movie is not only historically significant, but a very human drama. highly recommended for anyone that enjoys intense drama and great acting.
B007HACDLK|5.0|One of the best authors today in the political/military thriller genre.  The continued story of Mitch Rapp and his fight to thwart terrorism keep the reader engaged in this book following the story line from previous issues.  I can't wait until the next one arrives.
B0038W0OIK|5.0|Come January I will have owned my 7H USB headset for 2 years now and they are still going strong. I owned the 5H USB series and the only flaw with those was where the earcup and headband connected, which was a bad design and the connecting plastic cracked after a couple years of use. They addressed this with the 7H's and it is a much sturdier design now. No problems yet after the same 2 year time frame (keeping my fingers crossed). I absolutely love the retractable mic, which is the same design as the 5H...it works perfect and sounds great, so I'm glad they didn't change anything about that design.<br /><br />I own a set of Bose that I used to switch back and forth for music and gaming, but the 7H USB sound so good for music that I rarely pull out the Bose anymore. The highs, mids and lows are a perfect blend. Keep in mind I use the USB version, which I'm using the USB 7.1 soundcard dongle that comes with the headset. When plugged in using this USB dongle, it doesn't matter what soundcard you have in your system, as it only uses the USB soundcard located in the dongle.<br /><br />I play FPS games, where the footsteps and gunfire are very important for player position identification, and this headset is so good it's almost like cheating. I've owned a multitude of \\"high end\\" headsets in the past and these are by far the best that I have used.<br /><br />The only comment I can say about the people that have had problems with the quality of the headset are that they either abused them or they got a \\"lemon\\". Which in the case of the latter, they are a great company when it comes to backing up their products. They have no problem replacing their product when it is an issue with a defect. For those that say the sound quality isn't very good, they either got a defective headset or they are full of it.<br /><br />Looking forward to many more years with these 7H USB's!!!!!

B0032FPVKE|1.0|I bought the bag for my Canon SLR camera.  The bag only fits the power supply and nothing more. This is a small bag that is not designed for SLR cameras.  The description of the bag is not fair as it does not specify the size of the cameras that would fit in this bag.  I would also not recommend this for the smaller camera as to why would you want to put your convenient and small camera in this rather large bag?  Too small for SLR cameras and too large for pocket cameras.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|I was told that this is a great series by a co-worker so I checked the video on demand last week and noted that season 1 will only be available for a short time.  I watched the first episode just to give it a chance and less than a week later I am halfway into season 2.<br /><br />Cary (Clare Danes) works a lot of undercover missions for the CIA in the Middle East.  When the first episode opens she is told by an informant that a US POW has been turned by Al-Quida and is plotting an attack against the US.<br /><br />Next we see a US mission where a POW is found in an Al-Quida controlled prison.  The prisoner (Brody) was a marine sargeant held from the Iraq war for 8 years and presumed dead.  And just like John McCain, he returns to the US to a hero's welcome.<br /><br />Cary has her suspicions about Sargeant Brody and sets up illegal survellience in his house.  Through season 1 we are given teasers by the director as to whether or not Cary may be right as Brody tries to reconnect to a forgotten family who thought him dead and a politcal machine that wants him to go into politics.<br /><br />We learn that Cary is a loose cannon who takes mood controlling medication and was almost let go by the agency 10 years prior.  The only person who went to bat for her is her mentor Saul.  Cary is so embroiled in activities surrounding Brody that she cannot let Saul know what she is doing or she may lose her job.<br /><br />Two or three episodes into the series is all it takes to hook the viewer into it.  As good as Season 1 was, season 2 is shaping up to be just as good, if not better.  Clare Danes does a tremendous job in her role and is very convincing.  I highly recommend getting the first season on Netflix if you haven't watched an episode yet but be prepared to be hooked. I know I was!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like this game. It is a fun and entertaining game when I have down time. Would recommend for anyone.
B00877R85I|5.0|\\" Happy Hunger Games , And may the odds be ever in your favor. \\"<br />  I read the  fantastic Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. In this death defying Sci Fi story  the true theme of the story is survival and keeping your humanity and dignity as you try to  survive. I wonder if as your trying to survive you think ,will I survive ,  what will become of me. I believe Suzanne Collins will have every reader who reads this book on their edge of their seats. I hope readers will find the<br />Hunger Games  heart tugging , and inspirational.<br />  The Hunger Games take place in a poor town called Panem. The plot<br />explains the importance of survival and striving for  life. The characters are all different , and they all seem to have different  traits from one another, probably because of all their different experiences. I hope I see the characters grow more in the novel because they have grown a lot ,but I want more change from  them it would make me more satisfied. Suzanne Collins really used beautiful language when finding the main idea of the story. An  example is when she wrote , two people named Katniss and Peeta fighting for survival  against 22 other people from other districts . The main idea  is each year one  boy and one  girl are  chosen from each district to fight to the death. If your name is picked you must go and fight till their is only one person left. The whole idea behind the whole things is for peoples entertainment that is why they program it on tv so people will watch it , and the capital a lot of money from it. . The story has a  one big meaning,  people will fight for what they want most , survival.<br />  In an amazing review on amazon.com by E.R. Bird on the  famous  Hunger Games. She writes \\"  Your story often rests on the shoulders of the protagonist . \\" , \\" Is this a believable character ? \\" , \\" Do you root for him or her ? \\" ,  \\" Because basically it is a very hard thing to create a \\" good \\" person on the page that your reader is going to fall in love with . \\"After reading  this amazing review . I believe the reviewer sees the Hunger Games in  a different way then anyone else does because they give you a great amount of a good glimpse , and what it really means. The reviewer stated \\" Author's Craft can relate to having fun adventures involving a boy , his sister and a world beneath our world . \\" For a quote from a reviewer I went on goodeads.com , and I found a great quote \\" You don't forget the face of the person who was your last hope . \\" I believe this describes the Hunger Games amazingly because it tells you the truth of the Hunger Games . Thank you to amazon.com and goodreads.com for letting me use their resources for this paragraph.<br />  Well to the closing of my book review I've decided to share with you 3 books that you will love just as much as the Hunger Games. My first book is Tum Tum , and Nutmeg. In my favorite novel ever,  two unordinary mice live exactly like people in a small area called Rose Cottage in a  broom cupboard  , and the journeys they have will amaze you. In this greet book by Emily Bearns it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat.  Another great story is Beryl , A Pigs Tale. In this amazing story it  takes place at two different places a  commercial warehouse , and in the woods. Beryl is a young pig who has been separated from her parents and is in search of them. The  interesting part of the book is the pigs can talk. Jane Simmons will definitely have you begging for more. My final , and third book is The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz by  L. Frank Baum will definitely have you hungry for more  . In this amazing story that takes place in Kansas and The Land Of Oz a young girl named Dorothy gets trapped in a tornado and is blown off to an unknown place called The Land Of Oz  where strange things can talk , and there are good witches  ,and bad witches . Dorothy the young girl will definitely get you going. Well thats it for now ,but thank you so much for reading. Remember \\"May the odds be ever in in you favor . \\"

1475143389|4.0|I purchased the Kindle edition of Bigger Leaner Stronger and highly recommend it for beginners and novices to weight training and bodybuilding.  When I first got started weight training, I really had no idea how to set up a weight lifting program and did not know anything about dietary requirements for gaining strength and muscle mass.  I think personal trainers can be helpful, but they often don't provide advice on proper nutrition and can be expensive.  What I like about Bigger Leaner Stronger is that information on diet and a recommended weight training program are clearly laid out in a small volume.  In other weight training books, it can be hard to wade through the book to find the information you want, so I appreciate that Michael Matthews' book is clear and succinct.  I have started using the weight training program in the book and have made some gains in strength and muscle definition.  I think the book may be too basic for experienced bodybuilders, but it definitely has useful information for \\"newbies\\" and intermediate lifters.  Another plus is that the author will answer your emails if you have questions.
B009UVWBMA|5.0|I bought this for my 11 yr old daughter & she loves it.  Taylor is a good role model for young girls....just hope she keeps her head on straight & doesn't let the fan & money knock her into the world of drugs & alcohol.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|I don't write a lot of reviews. But I will add my two cents and agree with the 5 Star reviews of this wholeheartedly. I just purchased this after looking at it for a long time. I will say a big THANK YOU for all of those who expressed their opinions here. The mix is great. The sound is great. I have the Fillmore SACD and I believe this was recorded better than that. I also have the Deluxe Edition of the Fillmore also. This will now be my go to CD of live Allman Brothers. This is incredible. Get it while you can. I can't recommend this one enough. It also captures Duane, I believe, doing some talking between songs. I can't say enough, but it now!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found so many great things. From remodeling my bathroom to making my own lip balm.<br />Games to play with my grandson and quotes that are so me. What a great idea.
0761169431|4.0|This book was intended as a gift for a beginning young origami student.  The book does have a great introduction to the basic origami definitions, symbols, and basic folds with how-to-fold the different origami bases.  The book has origami models ranging from easy to medium to very difficult and tricky.  I would not recommend this book to a beginning origami student.

B005J4TLN4|2.0|This is a pretty disappointing film.  Horror movies especially low budget cheesy ones, work because there are characters you want to see killed, and characters you root for to make it to the end.  None of the characters who need to get their comeuppance in this one do.  You've got a gang of cowardly teens who not only surround and attack a nurse while she walks home as group, but threaten her with a knife so she'll take off her wedding ring which they can pocket along her phone and purse.  Good, can't wait to see these pathetic lowlifes die in the next couple of minutes you're thinking.  But alas they don't.  Then in their minds a firework destroys a car and the leader of this group of cowards decides to loot the vehicle for anything valuable.  Then when again in his mind a terrified dog bites him and runs off he yells out lets go get it and f it up, and the cowards chase after it cornering the frightened creature stabbing and bashing it to death.  This absolute scum of the earth have to about to die you think, but again nope.  Spoiler alert - in fact most of these evil little psychopaths never do.<br /><br />Most of the people who do are good guys such as two cops who compassionately keep talking to the victim of these thugs' violent assault and robbery while they patrol the streets and apprehend two of her attackers.  There was no point satisfactory wise for the audience in killing these two.  These were obviously hard working nice cops who wanted to make the streets safe for those that lived there.  They weren't corrupt or bullies or anything to make you feel some satisfaction when they were killed.  Then the gang of thugs feel nothing for these brave men who died joking how stupid they are to leave keys in the van.<br /><br />The point is you absolutely hated these kids, and there is no point in that for a horror film when they are the ones going up against something trying to kill them unless you can enjoy seeing them killed off one by one. I'm not claiming the kids did a bad acting job, I have no idea about that, I've never seen them in anything else, but the point is there characters were badly written to be what they were by the script writers.  With no good humans to root for, except the nurse, you've got no alternative but to root for the aliens and are pretty disappointed that they don't kill many of the thugs.  At least if the thugs learnt something from the whole experience you could have that but no, the white British kid trying to be a black American gang member sums it up with a the world owes me whatever I want reply. Why can't he help local kids he whines, when the nurse explained her husband is doing humanitarian work for children living in poverty in Africa. At the very least if they tried to defend the block of apartments and those inside they may have had some redeeming quality by the end of the film but all they were interested in was themselves and fighting (after they discovered it wasn't going to be easy like the one at the start of the film) the aliens to save themselves.<br /><br />I didn't mind the fact the aliens were pretty much giant stuffed gorillas with glowing blue teeth. I like cheesy low budget monsters.  But their intelligence level wasn't consistent, somehow they could travel light years through space but can't work out how to lift the lid on a dumpster.<br /><br />Nick Frost pretty much has not much more than a cameo in this film which is also disappointing especially when this film is being marketed by comparing it to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.  I never really bought that any of these kids were poor enough to be able to claim the world isn't fair that's why we are who we are and do what we do.  Their council flats were a lot bigger than these things are in real life South London.<br /><br />Attack the Block looked like it was going to be so good when I saw the cover.  Such a disappointment!kids did a bad acting job, I have no idea about that, I've never seen them in anything else, but the point is there characters were badly written to be what they were by the script writers.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|Saw one of these at a party and had to buy one.  This one is quite a step up in difficulty from the original, you may want to start with a simpler version before getting this one.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Harold Fry is recently retired.  Harold Fry has issues.  Harold Fry has regrets.  Harold Fry believes his marriage to be emotionally dead.  But, Harold Fry is also pretty accomplished at not thinking about these things.  Until the letter arrives.  Until he begins walking to the mailbox to post a letter of his own.  And then...his story, or more accurately his life, really begins.<br /><br />Harold's pilgrimage is about discovery.  Harold's first discovery is of the beauty of nature all around him, and he wonders how he overlooked this beauty all of his life.  He next discovers that he has physical limitations, going as he does from sitting in his chair all day to undertaking a 500-mile walk on a whim.<br /><br />As the miles slowly but steadily go by, we are allowed to join Harold as he tends his blisters, relives happy and sad memories, and meets interesting people.  We are privileged to walk with him as examines his life, both good parts and bad. Meanwhile, Maureen, his wife of a good many years, begins her own journey.  Harold's sudden pilgrimage is frustrating and confusing to her.  Maureen fears what this means to her marriage.  Yet, they do not share their discoveries with each other.<br /><br />As the distance traveled increases, so do the intensity of both Harold's and Maureen's experiences and memories.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1410453693 The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry]] draws the reader gently into Harold's journey.  It becomes more and more difficult to put the book down.  And the ending, which wraps up all the story lines very well, takes the reader completely by surprise.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1410453693 The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry]] by Rachel Joyce is an excellent book, and one I plan to re-read often.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Exactly as advertised. I can't attest to their longevity, but so far so good. Six more words needed so here.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Very rarely a film comes along driven by a central performance of such power and verve that you realize how important is the cinematic art and leaves you pondering why it has become quite so debased. Steven Spielberg's engrossing biopic \\"Lincoln\\" is not the usual IMAX fodder and neither is it designed to make many concessions to the audience in terms of historical narrative or political understanding. It is based on a central part of the best political book of recent years Doris Kearns Goodwin's mammoth \\"Team of Rivals\\" and does cry out for a depth of knowledge of the American Civil War and the nature of the 13th Amendment to pass the abolition of slavery into the US Constitution. From this you may conclude that its dry and dusty political drama. You could not be any more wrong.<br /><br />At the heart of the film is Daniel Day Lewis. His performance is completely thrilling and overpowering. Kearns Goodwin has paid him the huge compliment when she recently stated that \\"Daniel Day-Lewis perfectly and uncannily embodies Lincoln - from the way he looks to his mannerisms, voice, speech and conviction\\". As an actor he is renown for inhabiting the part but here you will never be able to think of Lincoln again without thinking Day Lewis. He embodies all elements of the Lincoln character, he owns the cinema and you realise that you are again watching the greatest living screen actor showing how it should be done. Spielberg has long harbored a desire to make a film about the greatest American President and he has found the right man for the job. Even today the Civil War remains the great fault line in American politics and at its heart is the genius of Lincoln a politician who in the US has almost garnered saint like characteristics (go to the memorial in Washington DC and try not to be moved), The brilliance of Kearns Goodwin's book was to show him as a warts and all politician who could plot and scheme with the best of them. He used his folksy Illinois guile and savvy to navigate his way through the greatest unfinished conundrum left by the Founding Fathers the question of slavery, yet at the same time could rise to the political summit in terms of his breadth of vision and oratorical genius. Somehow Day-Lewis captures all these dimensions.<br /><br />Spielberg's film pitches right into the action with Union soldiers faces squashed into the mud by Confederate boots and Lincoln discussing the Gettysburg address with his troops following the battle. The film is a slow starter as we become aware of the great characters of the age not least Lincoln's \\"indispensable man,\\" his Secretary of State, William Seward played wonderfully by David Strathain, his tortured wife Mary \\"Molly\\" Todd Lincoln manically played by Sally Field and a superb supporting role in the form of Tommy Lee Jones who brings to the great leader of the Radical Republicans Thaddeus Stevens, a performance of such roaring gusto that he steals every scene. His attack on a pro slavery democrat House of Representatives member is a tour force as he spits out with cold disdain \\"How can I hold that all men are created equal when here before me stands stinking the moral carcass of the gentleman from Ohio? Proof that some men are inferior. Endowed by their maker with dim wits, impermeable to reason, with cold pallid slime in their veins instead of hot red blood\\". Spielberg has finally done the historical charter of Stevens a great service and rescued him from the \\"mad abolitionist\\" of previous portraits. Equally his telling of the story of the passing of the 13th Amendment is a model in terms of tension and pace. The introduction of James Spader heading a team of unscrupulous political lobbyists in the direct employ of Lincoln adds some nice humour.<br /><br />Certainly the film has mistakes. Many will point out that Mary Todd Lincoln never attended debates in the House, that black people in the film are largely \\"bit part players\\" and its ending does become hagiographical as it moves into Lincoln's death bed scene and his second inaugural speech. But these are small complaints. This reviewer was lucky enough to see this terrific film appropriately in a packed cinema in Chicago and it has done roaring business across the US. It is proof that not all cinemagoers want endlessly dull 3D Marvel Blockbusters or the great President cast as a \\"Vampire Hunter\\"! Films that make you think, that chart the struggles of enlightenment and which resonate for today's events are rare beasts. If there is any justice in the world \\"Lincoln\\" will be recognised for what it is; namely a truly great film with a compelling central performance, a stellar supporting cast and subject fully deserving of this lavish treatments into Lincoln's death bed scene and his second inaugural speech.

B00846TRHY|5.0|In some parts of Africa. As a South African I can identify with the events, the central ideas and message of the film, these are events everyone struggle to talk about and to describe. Tens millions have been killed like that but things are much better now than what they were in the 1970s and 1980s, when these events were widespread, but today some areas are still unstable, especially some parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo. No amount of political and military influence is able to stop the violence, whether US, Chinese, South African or UN.<br /><br />Western countries owe a debt of gratitude to a number of African groups that continue to sacrifice their people, sometimes millions to fight and fend off certain groups, in order to secure important natural resources for Western and Eastern businesses and to keep certain terrorist groups from acquiring control over the natural resources. South Africans especially owe Mozambicans a debt of gratitude whose country lost about a million civilians in wars and South Africa is consequently helping to rebuild Mozambique, which has seen 7% GDP growth per year over the past 20 years. Google Between 1994 and 2006, average annual GDP growth was approximately 8% for Mozambique. So there is no better way to fight terrorism and violent groups than to build and invest and to keep building and investing.
B001DE29SS|5.0|This film was excelltently made in all its aspects. Robert Downey Jr., who has proven himself a very good character actor, did an exceptional job portraying Chaplin. This is a fascinating movie about a very talented though tragic human being who, though he was celebrated by many, apparently never was truly happy. But then of course who is in this life. Why Chaplin never became a U.S. citizen is a big question. Being barred from re-entry into the U.S. in '52 was an act of injustice but in his later life & posthumously Chaplin was recognized for his amazing accomplishments.<br /><br />A very informative film.

B00A11AN6O|5.0|But I will love it more , if you will be offering unlimited cloud use, like the one you offer  with the new Kindle fire
0811879542|5.0|We love this book! I don't understand the negative reviews at all - I think that's reader error! ;) in a world of technology where kids have no imagination needed for clicking a mouse, touch screen, or battery powered toy, this is a wonderful opportunity to have some creative fun with your kids. My 4 year old and 2 year old beg to read it all the time. For those reviewers  who said their kids didn't like it, I personally think they didn't read it as fun as its intended to be read :)

B009KKLQKO|5.0|This DVD is short and incomplete, yes.  BUT, to see all of the living Beach Boys together on one stage one last time brought a tear to my eye.  This tour was probably our last chance to see Mike, Bruce, Brian, Al and David perform together.  They look happy to be back, which is nice to see.  Even Brian, who as we all know has had his ups and downs through the years, appears to be in good spirits.<br /><br />The set list consists of your basic run-through of hits, with a few surprises:  \\"Sail On Sailor,\\" \\"Heroes and Villians\\" and \\"409.\\"<br /><br />The fact that this band has made it 50 years and is still thriving despite  the trials is a true testiment to their lasting power and legacy.  This DVD documents a one-of-a-kind time in the Beach Boys' career, and certainly deserves a place in any classic rock library.

B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is an incredible adventure story that takes the reader from the slums of Bombay to mafia life to the war in Afghanistan.  It's an epic story that sucks you in and moves you along for an amazing ride. The characters are fascinating, as is the author's descriptions of aspects of life in Bombay and beyond.  It's also absolutely hilarious at times. He throws in a few (easy to guess) mysteries along the way, and that and the tension brought by criminals, crazy people and other challenges keeps the pages turning. The weakest part of the book is the author's philosophical musings, which happen in the guise of conversations with the protagonist's mentor.  Once in a while, you choke on the author's tendency toward purple prose, but at other times, his turns of phrase are really quite wonderful. The ending includes a smart twist that you don't really see coming, but ties many loose ends together.  It an amazing labor of love by a talented first time author and keen observer of human nature, chock full of delights on many levels.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Hate the new upgrade it wont load any of my mail. Tried it several times and finally gave up and uninstalled it.
0547564651|2.0|This book is not really about how children succeed due to or through the development or nurturing of character traits, as it first appears from the title (and from the flap).  Rather, it is a reported piece on very specific anecdotes, many of which have to do with poor or inner city kids, including an extended chapter on chess, which has basically nothing to do with the experience of most parents.  In fact, the subtitle includes the word &#34;curiosity&#34; and there is NOTHING on that. In the last chapter, the author throws out the idea that you should hug your child a lot when they are little, and that's about as useful as this book gets.  If you are looking for an exploratory piece on the various theories of how character traits (and other traits) may or may not be linked to success (vaguely defined as happy, productive, fulfilled), or if you are interested in educational reform, you may enjoy this book.  However, if you are looking for guidelines or advice (or even conclusions) on how children in average circumstances succeed, this is not the book for you.

B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Rating: B ... Heat: Warm<br /><br />The tagline for this novel - \\"Sometimes love is an accident. This time, it's a strategy.\\" - could not be more appropriate. From the moment that Minnie and Robert meet, these two are at war. Because Robert's secrets are endangering Minnie's own and, if it comes down to it, she will take Robert down. Duke or no.<br /><br />Wilhelmina Pursling has spent most of her life trying to blend in. She is quiet and unassuming... until she feels cornered, that is. Then a whole other side, a side that remembers what it was like to be Minerva Lane, is unleashed. Minerva is brash and witty and cunning. And no one brings her out quite like the Duke of Clermont.<br /><br />Who is Minerva Lane? And why is she pretending to be Wilhelmina Pursling? That is exactly what Robert Blaisdell, the Duke of Clermont, would like it know. From the moment he sets eyes on her, while she's hiding behind a davenport listening to her not-quite fianc&eacute; talk about her, he realizes there is more to the not-so-mousy Minnie. She is the first and only person to ever see him--the man, not the title.<br /><br />Because Robert is also not what he seems. He is... a radical. A progressive. He views his position, his title's power, as something that shouldn't be abused. And he takes the saying `the sins of our fathers' quite literally. He spends his life trying to atone for his father's misdeeds.<br /><br />Together, Minnie and Robert were bound to butt heads. Their purposes oppose one another too greatly. A woman who doesn't want to stand out and the duke who keeps shining a light on her. And so, for most of the book, they battle it out. They fight with each other and with themselves. And, I've got to say, it made up some of my favorite moments. I loved seeing Minnie outmaneuver and outthink Robert. She is not a woman to be trifled with! (Which, I must admit, is one of my favorite types of heroines!)<br /><br />The Duchess War tackles social and political issues not often seen in a historical romance. It shows a view on the peerage not usually addressed. But... it's also not as romance-y as her previous books. Nor as steamy. I would've loved more time between Robert and Minnie without the past or any scandal involved. A great deal of effort and thought went into developing each character individually, and I would of loved if more time had been spent on developing their relationship and the romance.<br /><br />Which is not to say I didn't find the history fascinating. And I certainly like the idea of a progressive duke. I absolutely adore Miz Milan for her willingness to take risks and push the boundaries of what's expected in this genre. I'm eager to see where she's going to take this series next.<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br />\\"I dare say you'd never tell them that you were entranced by the curl of my hair. That's the sort of thing a man says to convince a woman, but men don't talk that way amongst themselves.\\"<br />He'd obviously expected her to swallow that codswallop about her hair, because he paused, slightly taken aback. And then, he gave her a shake of his head and a grin.<br />\\"Come, Miss Pursling,\\" he said. \\"Men wouldn't ask any such thing. They'd already know what caught my eye.\\" He leaned forward and whispered in conspiratorial fashion. \\"It's your tits.\\"<br />Her mouth dropped open. She was suddenly very aware of said tits--warm and tingling in anticipation, even though he wasn't anywhere near them.<br />He murmured, \\"They're magnificent.\\"<br /><br />*ARC was kindly provided by author in exchange for an honest review!<br /><br /> -- A Romantic Book Affairs Review.in a historical romance.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Going by the premise, I thought for sure this was going to be a lame show.  I watched the 1st episode on Netflix, and ended up watching all three seasons in 2 weeks.  Awesome show!  Can't wait until season starts again!

B009MF5BXK|3.0|I found this movie to be a bit of a let down after how good the first one was notice of a plot left a lot just hanging out there
1401322786|1.0|This book was by far one of the worst I have read. So many people were talking about it and I thought I would give it a go. The story lacks any sort of depth. I felt like based on the events happening in the characters lives that they would have some sort of internal battles or deep reflections, and they did not. This made them unbelievable as rational people.<br />I feel like this book does not give due credit to the human condition, and makes life seem simpler than it really is. I feel like the whole book could be summed up on an inspirational postcard, \\"Do the best you can, with the time you are given\\".<br /><br />Sorry to sound like a wet sandwich. I would not recommend this book to those looking for a literacy challenge.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|its fun to play. but you cant delete games from your list. some people don't play for days so you can get a list that goes for for a mile. probably better to get the app that costs money cuz this one doesn't have very many words. also people just write the name of what you are guessing instead of drawing something. example: the answer was&quot;jonny depp&quot; and someone just wrote &quot;JOHNNY&quot;. how stupid.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works perfectly on our kindle fires. Gives us all the info we need and then some. Haven't had any problems.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app is wonderful since I do a lot of high-lighting, underlining and marking up. I didn't like it at first because I found it to be very limited.  Then I decided to read the user guide.  Wow, what a transformation!!!  Would definitely recommend.  I told my sister about it who also has a kindle fire and let her know that we now have similar abilities to mark and make notes as my brother has on his ipad. ;-)
B005S9EJ46|5.0|One often hears about films--this one as well as others--that \\"it was not as good as the book.\\"  This is generally true when the film attempts to replicate the book:  prose is far more dense and nuanced than film:  a 60-page novella is often enough material for a feature movie.  Attempting to compress 200 or 300 pages for screening usually results in extensive cutting or moviegoers with bedsores on their bums.<br /><br />I first fell in love with the film, and then I read the book by Deborah Moggach (of the same title in the U.S.  Both are excellent but very different.  The film does not attempt to follow the book; rather, it takes ideas and characters from the book and makes a movie of them.  The book is darker and more conflicted, less love story, more familial strife.  Moggach writes very well indeed; I enjoyed the novel so much that I have purchased another of hers and look forward to reading it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Definitely worth it for general calculating.  Very convenient to have on Kindle Fire.  Nice big numbers. Thanking Amazon for this free app.

0316228532|3.0|This book was a bit hard for me to get through. Especially at the beginning. Once I got about halfway through, it started to come together and get more interesting.
B0000AQZYM|4.0|Works great! :) & case wadnt too bad of shape... my 2 year old son loves nemo. Deff interested in purchasing any Disney movies in the very near future.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Nature is spiritual and spirituality is nature. This story is essentially about life and death. The story's deep and devastating pain of loss of family and loss of innocence is the theme that every child over 13 will understand. Children are capable of understanding these ideas much more than we give them credit for.  I read pieces of Yann Martel's story and they don't begin to describe the terrifying beauty and vastness of the sea and sky that Ang Lee imposes on this story. CGI and visual effects technologies have become another tool in the palette of the director. The use of this technology with the ability the director,  animators, and imagineers to recreate a vision of a reality has truly come of age.  A spectacular Best Movie of the Year vote from me.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|this game is so addicting ,you have a hard time putting it away . it works wonders on your hand to eye movements ,you also need to keep your speed up to get the higher score to advance .don't do this one asleep
B0034G4P26|4.0|I was hesitant to purchase without having first seen it, but I took a chance.<br />I'm glad I did, for me it is a keeper and have also bought a copy for a gift. I'd say it's an enjoyable family film, it's witty without having to resort to adult inside jokes like Shrek or Puss in Boots (which are good too, but different humor). Though different from Wallace & Grommit, I think this production still has the same soul in it. Reminds me a bit of old comedy classic films, a kind of Abbott & Costello-ishness, Hugh Grant's Pirate Captain is completely obtuse but comes through in the end.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Best book I've ever read, hands down.<br />It was a page turner for sure, amazing.
0345803493|5.0|Book two was my favorite of the trilogy. Hated to see it come to an end. I wanted to keep reading.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I decide  to rate this book a 3 because it gave me a rushed feeling. The first novel had nor  details an  provided more of a story. This one seemed less developed.. still, it's a  interesting and kept me intrigued. I am excite  for what the 3rd has to offer.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downtown Abbey is my favorite show on TV.  I can't wait to see Season 3.  I have purchased both Seasons 1 and 2 from Amazon and watch them frequently.  I never get tired of this program.  I will purchase Season 3 as soon as it is available.
B00846REIS|5.0|Good book if you are into this type of romance novels. It is one to read if you have also liked 50 shades.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love this show, because it shows life and love as real.  The work first and then the friendships.<br /><br />Castle amd Kate show that they can work together, have fun together, and love each other.
034580404X|2.0|I had heard both good and bad feedback from friends who had read the book.  I refused to buy it but my sister finally purchased the trilogy on our shared kindle account, so I decided to give them a read.  To sum it up, all three books could have been condensed into a single book.  I found them to be a quick read.  However I did skim over a lot of the sexcapades and dialog; it quickly became really repetitive and boring.  Here's what I liked and didn't about the trilogy.<br /><br />Likes:<br />When I was in High School, I was obsessed with Harlequin Romance novels.  Christian Grey's description reminded me of that rich, aggressive, extremely handsome, darkly brooding type that every woman swooned over.<br /><br />I liked the formality in a lot of the e-mail language and conversations; some of the banter was quite entertaining.<br /><br />It was a story about learning to love yourself, and realizing that you are good enough and deserving of being loved.  But, I think that sometimes got lost in all the extra stuff.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />As hot as the main character Christian was, he was also very creepy.  The constant threat of his exercise of control over her, by spanking Anna, or tracking her movements, or tracing her calls, or reading her work emails, or popping up was a bit much.  As much as you wanted to like him because he was fighting with some \\"serious\\" issues, he just came off as a perverse, creepy, stalker.  I also didn't appreciate the attempts at cursing in the book.  It seemed disingenuous.<br /><br />Anna is supposed to be a sweet, pure, innocent virgin, who is completely unaware of how attractive she is.  There's nothing wrong with being naïve, but she comes across as dumb.I don't know of any contemporary college students, with half a brain that would become obsessed with a creepy stalker who is constantly stepping over the line, AND a pervert. She marries him after knowing him for a hot second, and is constantly in fear of \\"upsetting\\" him?<br /><br/>Who the hell is going to give up her virginity to a man she is in the middle of negotiating a BDSM contract with.  There is also not a woman alive who's rational line of thought, is constantly sidetracked by a man's sex game, or thoughts of sex with him.  Sometimes she can't even complete a coherent sentence.<br /><br />There is soooooooooooo much repetition.  It seemed like the same sex scenes and dialog were recycled ad nauseam.  I got so tired of reading \\"please\\" and \\"oh Anna\\" every other sentence.  And conversations over whether she ate. *sigh*<br /><br />The story is already quite unrealistic, but the author tries to weave in another stalking and kidnapping sub plots that are absolutely ridiculous.<br /><br />The text could have been reduced by 50 - 60% and made a lot of readers happier about reading these books.<br /><br />Overall..... Meh....  Maybe one day I'll go back and read over all the parts I skipped through;  or maybe not.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|do not by this add.if I hate it you'll hate it.please do not buy no mater what anyone says about it.
0060001941|5.0|I recommend this book who likes reading about a simpler time. A wonderful study of characters. A very heart warming story.

B002ZG99TK|5.0|I have not viewed it, as it's a gift, but everything was in good condition and disc appeared to be clean.
0307120007|5.0|Our baby loves this book. It's not too long and has different things for them to touch and smell and flip! It's a great learning tool and keeps baby's and toddler's attention! :)
B0002CX4RM|5.0|You will LOVE HIS DVD!! Domingo at his best, and the stage show production was incredible! Modern, and yet authentic, it has a perfect balance of both traditional, and modern style that comes together like only the Met can produce. I was so impressed with this DVD that I watch it occasionally and always see something new. It's great to keep around, since Domingo and Borodina are great  together. You can't lose with this!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I've had these for a while now and they work just fine, they glow in the dark and fit perfect for me - the only thing is they are supposed to be for men, I'm a  woman and it fits me just fine but might be a bit little for a mans hand so beware of that one.
B008NA3I30|5.0|Delivered as described on the ad.<br />I am very satisfied with this product.<br />Thank you and I love this movie!
0385341008|5.0|I could not put it down, and the people in it were so very real. We will now talk about going to Gernsey.  Has she written any other books?

0345803507|5.0|It's fifty shades do I need to say more! HOT and STEAMY with a story line to boot! Hope this author gives us more! I'll be first in line to buy her next series!
0385341008|5.0|I was looking for a \\"good book,\\" and feel so lucky to have had this one come to me.  The writing is so engaging; I got a real sense of each distinctive character.  I loved that it gave me a history lesson while telling me a wonderful story.  I found myself going online to find out exactly where Guernsey is, where it is in relationship to London, where Normandy is in relation to Guernsey (I needed to see how much of a trip Amelia and Dawsey had to make).  Everything is right about this book.
B005FITIDC|3.0|After viewing Machine Gun Preacher I wasn't sure how to rate it. I'm giving it 3.5 stars not because I thought it was entirely enjoyable and heart warming nor because I liked all the content. It most definitely is not family friendly. My wife commented that it is almost unanimous among her and her peers that the f___ word is the least socially acceptable. That is likely why it was chosen as Sam's favorite swear word, to express which side of the tracks he came from, the fact that he was a social outcast and he didn't care who knew it. The inclusion of such offensive material was most likely considered valuable to the story to depict a nitty gritty portrait of Sam Childers.<br /><br />***WARNING - SPOILER ALERT***<br />The story is about Sam's hour of reckoning in a life of violence, drugs, prison and drunkenness and him finding redemption. It is about him responding to God's grace by planting a church, where other bikers would feel welcome, and starting an orphanage in war torn Sudan, where the LRA terrorize children with unspeakable horrific acts. With a machine gun and a truck he sets out to rescue these children. It would have been a great heart warming story if it would have ended there, but Sam soon discovers that he can't save everyone and then wonders why God doesn't. This causes a downward spiral of anger, frustration and desperation.<br />***END OF SPOILER***<br /><br />Film directors seem to have such a difficult time projecting people's spiritual life, Machine Gun Preacher is no better. Sam's devotional life plays a key role in the unfolding drama, and yet we have little to go on which makes it a cut and paste job that leaves the viewer filling in the gaps. Perhaps if more attention was given to this, it would have been easier to identify with the character instead of being repulsed and detached by his eruption of angry outbursts. Even Christian minsters have to learn how to deal with their emotions. Self-control is a fruit of the spirit and a continual daily struggle. Patience, long-suffering and the like are tempered by steadfast devotion to God, through spiritual discipline such as prayer and Bible reading. Christian directors have a lot more work to do in portraying this aspect of the soul. Meanwhile, hard edged films like this will hopefully inspire better and more serious material in the future.<br /><br />While Amazon's editorial review states that the movie is a fictional look, I know for a fact that there are true stories that are quite similar to this one, where God has totally revolutionized murderous drug dealing thugs, turning them into soft-hearted ministers that literally lay down their lives to share the love of Jesus with others, not only in America but all across the world. I've met many of them, too many to count. From The Cross and the Switchblade to Machine Gun Preacher, their stories need to be told. The Gospel changes lives!

B0064NTZ6W|5.0|So, I got the single disc Blu Ray version of the Das Boot Director's Cut and, if that's all you're looking for, it's fantastic.  The two disc comes with the shorter US theatrical cut and a bunch of docs (at over twice the sale price of this bad boy), but personally the director's cut with commentary is all I really needed and that's all I got.  The movie looks and sounds better than ever in flawless 1080p.  I highly recommended it as a movie (one of the all time greats, if you haven't seen it, this is the version to see first) and as a product (a drop dead gorgeous transfer).  I am very pleased with my purchase.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|This season was good but not better than season 1. Here's hoping season 3 is way better than this one.

0743233832|5.0|Having discovered this memoir/book a few years back, this work has remained one of my all time favorties and is largely the reason for my enduring interest in philosophy. It is written in epistolary form (diary) and was never intended for distribution or publication. I would argue this is among the finest works in philosophy and one of the most important works that has been laid to paper. If you are experiencing your own \\"dark night of the soul,\\" this could be a life-saver. This is not 'self-help' however and will both challenge and force you to thoroughly examine every corner of your existence. This is a satisfying translation and the hardcover shell is both elegant and durable.

B001JRB16U|5.0|I used to watch this every year as a little person. I miss these types of movies and wish they still made muscials like this one. I don't think I will ever tire of this movie and forsee many more watches in the future.
1451613512|1.0|Yeah I know the history books are full of omissions, errors, data that was later found to be lacking, did I say lacking.  The \\"facts\\" of this book may, just may have been skewed a bit.  Perhaps more than a bit, but as I progressed it became apparent that Mr. Kuznik and Ollie were revising history as they would like to have it.  Yes when you get into the WWII era much has been left out of the conventional history books as the role and sacrifice of the Soviets but after all didn't the Stalin and Hitler have a pact?<br /><br />Even though I did not regard Ollie's name in the credits at first, it really started to show that Ollie's slightly scocialist and communist ideology came into clear focus.  Perhaps Mr. Kuzik was funded by Ollie and did that play a part in the content.<br /><br />I will let you decide.
B003VPWXRO|3.0|I loved Portia on Arrested Development.  I had no clue on Ally McBeal but then again, I never watched the show.<br />Portia's book started off great.  She hadn't yet come to terms with her being a lesbian and her husband had left her for her brother's wife!  Then it sort of fell apart for me after. That's where most of the book was now dedicated to her eating habits, dieting and insecurites of her appearance (and sexuality). I didn't mind that she wanted to touch upon those subjects at all but that's all she kept writing about.  She sprinkled it with a few interesting tidbits but it's too bad she kept hammering home her insecurities.  It's almost as if she didn't have anything else to write about. It became too repetitive.<br />On the other hand, her writing style is fantastic. She can definitely write.
1574214276|4.0|Do your doodles look silly?  Mine did too, but with the art of zentangle, not only do my doodles in boring meeting look frame-worthy, they are also meditative and help me get through the meeting without rolling my eyes too often! HAHA.  Seriously, this is a fun, creative way to enjoy a few moments of concentration away from the world and into a Zentangle.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Just great to watch the first new season of Doctor Who with out commercials, and finally available at an affordable price.  Thank you Amazon!
B001ANSS5K|3.0|The first John Green book I read was LOOKING FOR ALASKA, and then THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, and then PAPER TOWNS.PAPER TOWNS holds the traditional John Green humor and wit, but also the formula of a somewhat nerdy and incredibly smart main character who is borderline obsessed with a mysterious pretty girl. Perhaps I would have given this book more stars had it been the first book I read by Green; I definitely did not get as attached to the characters as I previously had. If you have the time to read it, it's a nice read but it doesn't live up to \\"Alaska\\" or \\"Stars\\" in my opinion.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|My favorite app. Click on the logo and it listens to any song that is playing and will tell you the title and singer. Sometimes you get the strolling lyrics (like Karaoke) or a link to the lyrics.
B00632HWOG|1.0|after update unable to check email, I guess I have to get anew account somewhere else. although I'fe been with Yahoo for many years
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this CD because I think Adele is perfect.  Her voice is impeccable, her style of singing is wonderful, and she is just a beautiful lady.  I am ready to buy the next one.
B005LAIGSC|4.0|Film is well done having enough surprise twists to keep it interesting.  The ending was less than satisfying.  We all found ourselves rooting for Denzel, hoping that he was really a good guy and would be able to clear his name and survive.
B008VBYN80|5.0|so much fun to play I enjoy it....mindless fun for the family I poke the graphics and sounds while playing
B000K2UIW8|5.0|Great movie, excellent acting, photography, special effects, and an enjoyable story.  A must see!  Few movies have achieved this level of excellence.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|I've seen it before but in a pinch I downloaded this while on a plane. Even a mile or two in the air the quality was great!
B0041G67YW|5.0|Well worth seeing.  Wonderful acting, photography, excellent directing and attention to every detail has told an inspiring story in a way which is very entertaining.  We begin the story not knowing if a con game is being perpetrated or just a rich man's diversion.  The message of this drama goes much deeper into human desire and fulfillment.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|this app is amazing if you like pokemon you will love this app. the monsters are so cute also. it cant get better. I don't like very many apps but I love this one.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Got this for my son last year and even after hundreds, and yes I mean hundreds, of hours of gaming it is still going strong.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|Just like I imagined it to be.  My sonl loves it. Great! We all do.  It is just one more piece of Disney magic.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I think this game is super douper good but the only thing that bugs me is that it makes ringing noise when the pets miss me but I do recommend this game I think its fun
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The only thing I don't like is how people mysteriously seem to return from the dead (Brienne)! Explain sir! Pondering is no fun.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Liked good read can't wait to read the last book in hunger game series have a great day frog frog
0785163174|4.0|Like the last couple of events I've read from Marvel.  The build-up is the best part and then you get to the ending and realize it was not worth the hype.  However, it does lead the reader into the Marvel NOW reboot/relaunch, so you get the back story that the current issues are building from.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|all I can say is that it is so HARD!!! if you have a kindle fire I'm warning you right now DONT GET THIS APP!!! :( you cant even control pac man and the people your competing with are always going ahead of you no matter what!! and it copies Mario mart.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|I love A Chistmas Carol! But I regret ever deciding to watch this watch this movie over the weekend.  Although the film is beautiful, its also down-right scary!!  I'm almost 26, and this movie scared me to death.  I remember thinking, \\"Ok, if I keep watching this, it'll get better\\".  I was wrong, it only got worse.  When Jacob Marley's jaw broke I was shocked and horrified.  But that wasn't even the worst part.  The scariest part was when the ghost of christmas present was dying and decomposed into a skeleton with eyeballs in its skull, who was laughing hysterically.  This is NOT a kid's movie!!  If this scared me, an adult, I can only imagine how much it would scare a child.  I've had a hard time sleeping ever since watching this movie.  I have only one more thing to say to anyone brave enough to watch this movie.  Warning, this movie may cause you to become sleep-deprived due to nightmares, or because you're too scared to go to sleep; after seeing the horror that is Disney's A Christmas Carol.  Viewer beware.....
1449410243|3.0|The cartoons that you get are funny, but it feels like a majority of the book was filler.  The website is funnier.
1451613512|2.0|An extremely surprising and disappointing book that I had expected to be much different.  Is openly pro-communistic and anti- United States.  Obviously written by ultra liberal left wingers who do not care for our capitalistic form of republic.
B008GOAFBQ|1.0|False advertising or bad quality control? Either way the people that pre-ordered this for the bonus material/2nd disc as it was advertised got fooled. Many didn't even know until they got it in the mail. 2 weeks prior to the release they stopped taking orders for the \\"Deluxe 2cd edition\\". I don't believe the explanation that some have given, blaming Amazon for getting their info from \\"unofficial\\" sources. Amazon is selling a lot of their cds so I'm pretty sure they're getting info directly from the record companies on pre-orders. Did someone at KI$$ corp see how much interest there was in the unreleased demos & decide to hold them back for future re-re-releases of the entire set? I'm very disappointed in the current state of this band that I once considered one of my favorites.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This is one of the best science fiction movies I have seen.  Lots of action and a overall great story, some laughter, some romance, a great movie.  Lenny
B00005LC1H|5.0|This show is so funny!  I got it as a gift for my in-laws and they loved it too.  Course my wife and I had to borrow it and watch it a few times as well.
B0039NK0LE|4.0|This movie has a lot of laughs and it is a great movie.  I have seen it 3 times I like it that much.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|GREAT MUSIC I LOVE IT VERY MUCH A A A A A A A A A A A A A
B008YWY0HK|1.0|The DVD quality is terrible.  I watch movies on my computer and this movie won't even play on my computer.  It has some kind of copy protection that literally makes it unplayable (all the titles on the movie have a length of zero seconds).<br /><br />Why would Disney release a DVD that is so far outside the DVD specifications that the movie is literally unwatchable?<br /><br />I'm going to buy the Blu-Ray version.  Maybe I can actually watch that version.

B0063IH60K|3.0|get rid of the ads then it will be better... better Vegas scoring. too.. but all in all an ok game
B000WEMH3C|5.0|I have only used this cover for about 3 months but is seems to work great.  I was a lower priced option but I am very glad I purchased it.  The material is acceptable and I should be able to get a few good years out of it.
B009DT98RK|5.0|If there was any doubt about Frampton's guitar skills, watch this and get ready to be rocked. Plenty of licks in all the classics.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just recently had surgery, so having a lot of time, I read the entire book in 2 days. Fun easy read, and hard to put down. Worth downloading it.
B0090O07RS|5.0|Clear picture, well filmed, great sound. This is amazing how they were able to clean up a 45 year old video. Simply amazing.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I loved this book because I'm not a history buff  and don't really like to read about it either but this was so beautifully written that you don't even feel like it's about history. I am looking forward to the next two books and will start the second now . Read this book you won't be disappointed. Follett knows how to weave stories seamlessly!
B004FEJ3VY|5.0|Got this toy for my friend's son who turned 5 year old. He loved it so much that he told his parents he does not want anything from Santa! Very cute.  Glad I was able to find this toy.
0810993139|5.0|This also was a gift in the letter to santa program. this little boy is also funny ans smart and a pain parents and<br />teachers.<br /><br />Elaine Green
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great read. Hard to put down. I can't wait to read the next two. Highly recommend the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it, couldn't put it down actually. I had already seen the movie. Even though I knew all the big moments that were going to happen, I was drawn to keep going by the suspenseful ending in every chapter.
1452110581|4.0|A very fun book for cat lovers.  A great Christmas stocking stuffer ... The majority of poems are funny with only a couple just so-so.  One can identify with the contents if they have a cat.  And even if you don't, it makes you laugh.<br />My cat owner/lover friends enjoyed this 'gift' ... and turns out to be a bedtime reader for some of their furry bed pals!
B003Z39G0O|4.0|I like most of the songs on this cd, but some I do not like.<br /><br />I love cut by Plumb and bloodstream by Stateless.<br /><br />I would recommend this cd especially if you are a Vampire Diaries fan.
0316227706|5.0|This delightful book is being given to all my dog lover pals.  It is a great book with a variety of 'underwater' dogs seeking out their toys.  You will laugh as you page through this book and find some of these dogs with expressions too funny for words.  Yes ... you will laugh out loud as I did.  Clever photography indeed, with very limited written words makes for a quick read but one that will be repeated again and again.  Casteel, the photographer, had quite a task completing this book, yet, you will find it a joy to own for all ages.
034580404X|5.0|This is a rush of events on paper! It shows something that individual is interested in and lets you express your affectionate life without actions! I haven't read books this good ever! When is the movie coming out?!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Ir works well and I appreciate having my favorite books available at hand. I had uninstalled it, as I was hoping it would restore<br />another app I had, but it hasn't. I might as well have my app for books then!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am having fun playing this game,  but I am having a hard time finding the objective of the game as of yet.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|excellent movie loved it recommend it without hesitation. i had to go to the bathroom and never went even though it was a DVD and I could pause it amazing acting.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Totally love this game! I just wish my energy would stop running out so fast because I am completely hooked! Absolutely worth a try, it's free so you have nothing to lose so try it because you'll definitely love it!

B0018QQQK8|5.0|The lucky one was yet another great book  to read by Nicholas sparks.  Well  worth the time to read, great characters. I suggest that everyone take the time to read .
B005LAIHZY|4.0|pixar enough said they always turn out a great product. great animation and great stories. look forward to many more from them
B0045TYDNC|5.0|I think these new Nikon lens caps are a nice improvement over the older design.  They have a much more secure fit, and shouldn't wear out as quickly.  I've ordered enough to replace the caps on all my lenses.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Perfect way for any Doctor Who fans to start getting into it. Although it's not the original series, it's still awesome.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|evermote is a wonderful app you can make it your reading journal, your grading book, or anything you want. I use it for many things. It is tootle awesome. I think feathers should use it and every one on the planit earth.
B000F8O35U|3.0|The folks reading the reviews won't have much choice but to rent or buy it----or face the tantrums; and the folks watching it won't be reading the reviews, or can't.<br /><br />It's only a movie, I kept telling myself...  There's one song that seems to make Materialism into a Value, as if to catch the audience Madonna might have missed.  Then there's Ariel, who has to be one of the most useless animated heroines, ever.  The girl has no ambition, no drive, and no big ideas beyond collecting ocean floor bling and marrying a Man---not a mer-man, a Man, with legs.  Needless to say, Daddy---the King of the sea, and we're not talking tuna---is utterly clueless and frustrated, since she ignores everything he says (so much so it's amazing that the shark still hasn't eaten her).  Finally, Daddy-King finds out what she's up to and blows up, so the little spoiled brat runs away to the Octo-Witch and trades her soul, or something, for legs, and gets her wish.  And, fortunately for her, there still aren't any consequences because Daddy is prepared to give up all of his power AND his life, to save her.<br /><br />And they wonder why our kids are such brats.<br /><br />Or why you let your little girls watch this stuff.<br /><br />Oh well, you do, and you'll buy it anyway, so my revenge will be you stuck behind the TV watching this AGAIN, for the umpteenth time.<br /><br />Those of you with mensa kids might want to do some prepping though.  It would be really embarrassing to walk into a room where your five year olds are discussing the ramifications on world peace, stability, and the food supply, from a marriage between a land based Kingdom and a Sea-God dynasty, if all  you can say is \\"Now children, it's only a movie!\\".
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I was having trouble envisioning Rod Stewart doing Christmas songs - but WOW!  It's a great CD and I love it.  He still has a lot of charisma!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is SO MUCH Fun! it is very cool! Love it and it is not only for kids, adults love it too! :)
B006O6F932|5.0|With a daughter who has an extensive M.H. collection, I had to get the high school playset. It will be a Christmas gift, so she hasn't played with it yet, but I am sure it will be a big hit. I have purchased other M.H. accessories, and have yet to be disappointed. I am sure this will be no exception.
0763619612|5.0|I bought this for my 5 year old grandson who enjoys drawing.  He said he couldn't draw as well as his mom or myself so this is a book to show him that it doesn't matter.....you can draw a dot and go from there.  The Dot is one of his favorite books and he has framed his picture of &#34;dots&#34; and has it in his bedroom.
B009FB3WQ4|1.0|Barbra has been my favorite for 20 years, this DVD is a waste of money the only two songs worth listening are the ones Barbra sang.<br /><br />I guess because it goest to charity no good singers participated.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|maybe not as good as the first two  but entertaining just the same--  Worth at least a rental<br />An interesting tie in to the originals
B00275EHJG|5.0|Yet another winner from Pixar!  Anyone that is a fan of the other Toy Story movies will not be disappointed!
B00260HH3K|2.0|Options:<br /><br />If you are a die hard fan of the anime, and/or manga and can't stand movies that don't do them justice... this one is NOT for you.<br /><br />If you are a die hard fan of DragonBall and would buy anything with the name on it regardless of the quality... this one is for you.<br /><br />In my opinion:<br /><br />DragonBall Evolution... I was trying hard to see where the movie fit in, and it just does not. If they made it like the main actor was a Saiyan (just not Goku, or a known character) then the story could have been twisted and turned because it would have been original and wouldn't have tampered with an existing one (though this film doesn't change that story). Instead, DragonBall was thrown into a blender giving small bits of familiarity with a lot of cheesy unknown \\"what the heck is this\\" content, wrapped in a (Made for Syfy, yet ended up at the box office) film with a reputable \\"DragonBall\\" bow tied around it.<br /><br />If you don't think about the name, and you enjoy \\"Made for TV films\\"... its not extremely bad (though it is cheesy), that's why I've given it a 2 out of 5 stars.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This is a great collection of Christmas classics from a great performer.  I am a fan of much of his work and this is no exception.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This is the extended edition and if you have not purchased the normal edition on Blu-ray i would defiantly recommend spend the extra and go with extended.
0195067142|5.0|I acquired this book after seeing &#34;The Pacific&#34; from HBO. The first hand writing and details are more powerful and penetrating than anything I've seen made for television or movies. I won't go into details, as there are many reviews that do so. I will say that it is well worth the read, and that I came away with a deep respect and gratitude for what those Marines endured.
B0091XIZO0|5.0|This Lang Lang C.D. is a sheer joy, and I play it at least once a day, every day. Definitely one of my ten favorites in my collection.

B0016J81B4|4.0|these shoes are a good value compared to what's available in slip-resistant work shoes at big box retailers. Food does stick in the tread, and I had to order a half size smaller than my street shoe, but otherwise I would recommend these to any cook on a budget.
B009XPFSUA|5.0|Always looks like the end.....never is. Incredible plot twists and character development. Never thought my eyes would tear up over a 'biker soap opera'! Great songs throughout, also. Good job fellas!
0525478817|5.0|could not put this book down; one definitely must set aside a 8+ hour period without distractions to finish this book!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Never seen all three movies even so they are a few years old. Very good with Blue-ray player. Probably better with my surround sound like the Theater set up in my basement but don't have a Blue-ray player though.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|OK, the songs are catchy and rich, with meaning and depth, but I think some Gaga fans are going to be just a little disappointed.  The songs on the album don't have the same level of elegance or catchiness as her previous works.<br /><br />Now, I get it, that an artist evolves and moves on, and that fans just can't keep on expecting new derivations of prior hits.  And, it's not like her songs lack substance or are devoid of artistic meaning.  However, the songs don't rise up to the same level of melodic and harmonic excellence of what she's done in the past.<br /><br />The songs certainly pleasant to listen to, but these songs won't be the first pick on the karaoke machine.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I love Rod Steward since I was young. His music never gets old.  His Christmas album is a treat.  I usually don't buy Christmas music, but this was exceptional.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Owen spends the first half of the book talking about his personal experience in becoming a SEAL and reasons for doing so.  He recounts numerous missions his team went on, which in their own right would make an excellent book.  You get a pretty good feel for what kind of guys these are and what their interactions with each other are like. The second half is all about the bin Laden raid.  Make sure you have a good block of time available before starting the second half as you are not likely to be able to put the book down once you start the second half!  Book also has very nice diagrams illustrating the house and exactly how it was infiltrated and exfiltrated, so the text is easily understood.  I really enjoyed this book and it gave me a new appreciation of the heroic actions these guys (and the folks who support them) do for our country every day, then brush it off like it's just another day at the office.
B0011Z5CV0|2.0|We ordered this you thinking that our 18 mo old or 4 mo old might be interested in this toy but neither of them are capable of pushing the buttons and our older child gets really frustrated when he can't make it work. Additionally, we were under the assumption that the music had words; instead, it plays very short songs although we do recognize most of them. The record feature is much too short. Overall, the toy really wasn't worth the price and you'd be better off buying a stuffed animal...
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this game is amazing I played it on the computer first but it is great on the tablet to love it
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The game is a bit simple and easy even at the highest level.  But definitely worth every penny I paid. It serves as a decent distraction.
B008E5ZVBQ|5.0|I love this group and cannot get the actual CD here in the states.  Was very glad that Amazon had it for download so that I could the the music.  Thanks!!!

B007SGM084|5.0|Fifty Shades Trilogy has been a great series to get into.  Started with the first and had to get them all!  Fall in love with the characters, I did!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|best ever<br /><br />please buy this game cmon definitely beats angry birds<br />just do it ti e stars awsome I love it
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Great game!!  I was first into to this game on my brother's phone.  I ordered my own copy and have been hooked since.  Showed it to a friend and she's now addicted to it.
145210655X|5.0|I saw this and instantly knew I had to buy it for my brother. He is a huge Star Wars fan, and I thought this would be the perfect gift for him. From the few pictures I saw on Amazon, I could tell the artwork was adorable and each page was very clever and funny. I loved reading through it when it arrived and am now even MORE excited to give it to him! I know he will love it and I highly recommend this book. I want to buy myself a copy now!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|There was a big hype going around to check out the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy.  As soon as I brought my new kindle, I thought what the heck I am going have a sneaky read of Fifty Shades of Grey and find out what the hype was all about. Downloading the trilogy from Amazon was the best thing I did because once I had the Fifty Shades of Grey downloaded onto my kindle I had the freedom to read it anywhere at anytime without having to feel like strangers on the train were judging you by the book title.  Skeptical I start to read the first chapter and 'boom' I am hooked right through to the last chapter....OMG How did that happen?  I loved this book so much I am back on Amazon downloading the other two books.
0156012197|5.0|This book is so magical. I love it more than just about any other book I have ever read. It is so whimsical and full of dreams, and the messages it shares are so beautiful and full of truth. This book explains what life SHOULD be; as simple, innocent and lovely as it is to a child.<br /><br />I bought three copies for Christmas because I have been meaning to give this book to each of my friends for a very long time. I can't wait to share it with them!
0374214913|3.0|A fun adventure, though finishes far less strongly than it begins. It's a bit of a send-up of the modern, internet-driven world in which we live, and has a lot in common with Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, with plenty to say about the Millennials, the generation of folks coming up in the world, who are wonderfully clever, perspicacious, and wholly capable.<br /><br />The plotting's breezy, details are thin, but overall there's a refreshing sense of whimsy, of youthful camaraderie, and simple adventure. The biggest problem with the narrative is the lack of stakes. The ultimate reveal falls flat - the book's just not about anything terribly big, exciting, or dangerous. As for characters, Clay's fun; a wry observer of the modern world.  But the supporting characters ultimately exist solely to satisfy the demands of the plot. If Clay has to analyze a book with a computer, his girlfriend works for Google. If he needs a forgery of an old book, well, his roommate's a special effects guy for ILM. In need of a brilliant computer hacker, he needs only ask his best friend - a software mogul - for the loan of a young Russian prodigy. In short, Clay never actually has to do anything for himself. That makes for a boring hero. So two stars off for plotting and weak supporting characters.<br /><br />Otherwise, though, an enjoyable, diverting read; a solid airport/airline book. There's an audible version as well. I've listened to the Audible dot com example, and it seems nicely done. It'd make a nice companion on a long car/plane/train ride.
B0085YNML2|5.0|It was so fun, I felt the little iquana was so cute. It was very, which made it challenging. I would defenently tell my sister to get it, in fact I did.
0307887448|4.0|If the title doesn't ring a pop culture bell for you, then you need to go out and rent/stream \\"Sneakers,\\" an under-appreciated, in my opinion, film from 1992. If the bell does ring, then you might be the perfect reader for this book. The novel follows Wade Watts, aka Parzival, a high school senior who has lived almost his entire life in a virtual reality world known as OASIS. As the United States has suffered economic and environmental catastrophe, just about everyone else has also abandoned the real world for the virtual one.<br /><br />Wade is a gunter--a seeker of the treasure hidden in OASIS by its creator, James Halliday, when he died. Because Halliday was obsessed with late twentieth-century pop culture, OASIS reflects that, so anyone trying to find the \\"Egg\\" needs to be equally obsessed. As Wade and his friends are.<br /><br />The story is fun--a post-modern quest pitting the resourceful gunters against the evil mega-corp who wants Halliday's fortune for their own nefarious purposes. There is also a bit of a warning to the attentive reader--how close are we to a world like this? But the real fun comes from all the pop culture references--and seeing how many you know. While there are a lot of video game references, there are also TV, movie, and music mentions. Some are explained; some are not. \\"Setec Astronomy,\\" for example, wasn't, and I think that was the only reference to the movie in the book. You are just expected to know or to want to go find out. Since I didn't hang out in arcades when I was a kid, I didn't get all the video game references, but I was pretty good with most of the TV and movie ones. But that didn't make me enjoy the story any less.<br /><br />And as hokey as the game is by today's standards,  it will make you want to pull out your old Atari 2600 and play Adventure.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|In the holiday season, where entertainment options swing between saccharine and sarcastic, it's nice to watch a film that's sweet and genuine, with just the right amount of silliness. The movie is exactly as I remember it from our worn out VHS tape- the DVD faithful to the original film as I remember it. Michael Caine is great as Scrooge, and the adaptation of the Dickens classic is true to the spirit of the tale, with appropriate use of and homage to Dicken's famous turns of phrase.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|love it. that sums it up well!!!! i really like it. it works great!! i love it to pieces!! i have not had problems with it at all!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so fun to play! I love how it gets more and more challenging with each new grid size. Its AMAZING!
B008K8VDPU|3.0|This application was not as much fun as I thought it would be and the choices for the changes are not easy to do.  I will probabbly not use it much.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is my favorite tv show that I have ever seen.  It is a space western and will suck you in quickly.  It is just a shame that it was canceled so early.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Reminds me of the jungle book if it happened on the ocean. I really loved this magnificent piece of literature.
1423140591|5.0|We all love these books. My kids ask for a new book from Rick Riordan every time they come out.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Surprise surprise...the Facebook app for the kindle is also garbage. Like others have said, only loads first 10 or so posts.
1423140605|5.0|My 13-year-old son wanted this for his birthday, and he and his 16-year-old brother raced to see who would be the first one to read it. They both loved it!
B009E3EXMU|4.0|The DVD footage is really cool and made the box set worth buying.  The rehearsal footage is a rip off though.  The behind the scenes footage is from 1 camera angle about 2000 ft away from stage...totally useless run through of the concert prior to the 02 show.  Almost note for note so not worth watching and you can't see anything anyhow.  Its like sitting in the last row of an arena.<br /><br />CD is good sounding although there are some suspicious sound vocal edits on some later tracks.  Overall an amazing effort for the Zeppelin guys.  I hope I can still play my guitar when I'm their age.
1423101499|5.0|My 13 and 16 year old boys love this series and have read them several times. Even my 19-year-old daughter reads them. Great gifts for kids or for your own enjoyment if you like youth fantasy action.
0061122416|5.0|I bought this book for my husband who likes books on self betterment. He enjoyed the book so much he read the 175+ pages with in 2days. He said he enjoyed that is really tought you to follow your dreams despite the set backs you might face.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can sync books from either of my Kindles and on my phone. This is great! I can read wherever I go.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SERIES! Now that I've bought into the series, watch them cancel the series.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I really like this. I appreciate having the full version to edit and view my documents. I haven't done anything fancy with it, though. I'm sure it's capable of doing more than just editing documents my friends have sent me.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Bored with regular solitare then give this a try...it's a fun and challenging app.  This game uses 12 decks of cards and you must put then in desending order luckily color and suits do not matter.
B0041KVZ18|5.0|Its all been said before.  Fifrteen more silly words are required in order to make this review &#34;request&#34; go away.
1936891026|1.0|This book is really not insightful, enjoyable, or useful in any significant way. I thought with all the high ratings it couldn't be that bad. Now, I wish I spent that time reading a really good book! The Author is obsessed with &#34;Resistance&#34; (with a capital R), which he says every other sentence and is just his special way of saying &#34;procrastination.&#34; The book is basically about the author's obsession with thinking about being unproductive. Skip this book!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is not like the PC or Xbox360 for it does not include many creations but it is still an exciting game for whenever you are on the road or just at home and bored (It still includes the basic fun items to build and to create though)
B002T9H2L0|4.0|Haven't seen it yet but I heard its ggod.ill watch it someday but don't have time thank you I'm done
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|hate it when it freezes I wish that I was able to save and transfer my progress to my other kindle
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This is was order for a chirstmas gift for my granddaugheter her mother has it on VHS.  My kids enjoyed this moive and I know my grandbaby will too.  Excellent condition.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Most Christmas music is so repetitive that by two weeks after Thanksgiving, I don't want to hear it anymore.  This one is so addictive that I am sad when the holidays are over and I need to wait another 11 months to get it back out next year.
030759565X|5.0|As a long time smittenkitchen.com reader I was thrilled to see the book when it came out- it does not disappoint!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good book, not a great ending. Wish the author would have really ended it and made a choice. Not sure I want to read anything else by this author.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|This is re-order of RENT for my wife. She let a friend borrow her original copy and it was never returned. So I reordered it for her and it will be a nice little extra at Christmas. Great movie that will stand the test of time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very addicting game but it needs more updates I have completed all the puzzles so now I don't play there is no point.
B003L77GH4|5.0|My wife and I watch Vampire Diaries. We love the series. It's a good show for everyone in the family. I ordered her this season two disc set for Christmas and I'm sure she'll love it. Thanks for the great price, Amazon!
B008N1V11U|5.0|i literally cant stop playing this. it is just like arkham city which is of course a good thing. i recommend this to anyone who likes batman!!!
B00371QQ2U|5.0|Wonderment, family, technological amazement, love, love of discovery and more....I'd always been fascinated with how the heck did we get to the moon and more amazed that we got back in one piece using antique devices...I'm not sure but it seems the average iPod has equivalent computing power compared to the boxes used during NASA's early days...Moreover, memorable characterizations by Hanks and company...Yup, a 5 star film...
6304401132|5.0|Starting with Cinderella, we bought just about every Disney fairytale movie when the kids were growing up.  Somehow, we only rented this one---until now.  Very happy to have that hole in our line-up filled, and such a wonderful piece of cinematic history, too!  Even the boys can't agree which color dress looks better on Aurora, the pink, or the blue, but they ALL loved that dragon!
1405910259|5.0|Great book!!! If you liked 50 shades of Grey, you will enjoy this one as well. Can't wait for the third book to come out!
B007YJ8ZRK|3.0|Didn't like the way the movie was made. Could have been a better movie. Had a lot of potential. Don't recommend it.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Its an ok game. the game play is kinda slow. you can only play about three games with the ponies. some of the ponies you have to get back cost too much. like Rarity is the third pony that you have to welcome(buy) back but she cost 90 jewels! I only keep it because its cute and I like MLP.
B007Z9QS5K|4.0|Decent entertaining movie. Not a great story line. Some boring characters but overall a great 2 hours to get away from reality.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I first heard of Ellie Goulding about two years ago when I listened to &#34;Under the Sheets&#34; and &#34;The Writer.&#34;  She soon became one of my top all-time favorite artists.<br />I have to admit, it took about two listens before I really warmed up to &#34;Halcyon&#34; but now, it's become a favorite.  I still think &#34;Lights&#34; was a superior album, but this comes very close.<br />Keep the tunes coming, Eliie!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I found this movie to be entertaining. It was a bit hokey but overall a great movie to watch with the kids.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good book and it wasn't the sexieness of the book. The story line is very catchy. I loved reading it.
B007UXSKMU|5.0|One of Tom's best movies. We have watched it several times. We would highly recommend anyone to watch it. Watched it everyday for 7 days on a cruise. Since there wasn't anything else to watch. Know it by heart.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I purchased this for my boy who loves this movie.  We gasped at this set's beauty!  200% worth the money.  My son particularly loves the music box.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I never thought about doing yoga till I got this DVD. I was suprised by how good my back felt after a few workout. The isolation drills involve layering so it's helping my coordination. The shimmy drill is completely beyond my skill level but I'm hoping it'll come with time if I just keep at it. It's got a lot of workout for your money.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|my friend always talks about this and I was so waiting for it to come out ob the kindle fire IT EPIC!!!!!!!!!!&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
B008LZHA3G|3.0|Is this a pretty bad CD or is this just me??  If you are looking for Positively Fourth Street or Like A Rolling Stone be sure to look elsewhere.  Bob Dylan evolved but the question is into what exactly.  I guess you can't mess with perfection and to me, songs such as Positively Fourth Street just can't be surpassed or even equaled. I am sure there's some gems in here if you want to find them; but like those dudes on the beach with coin finders, have time to look hard or don't waste your time.  Bob Dylan is my hero; he's an amazing talent.  For me though I will still enjoy his earlier work which is pure genius.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Wonderful!! I loved every song on the CD. Rod Stewart can sing anything!  I hope the CD does well for him.
1594201927|4.0|I rather enjoyed this book although I am, like some other reviewers have admitted, financially challenged. Ferguson writes in a style aimed at the general reader who may not know his Fannie Maes from his Blue Chip preferred. I do think that the book tried to be too much of an overall survey, which left some subjects inadequately covered. This especially seemed true in the arena of more recent events. However, his sections on early financial history, including the origins of the several types of financial institutions, were excellent.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I took the time to start it and to see how many problems arise and well not a single glitches! I am happy and so is my 4yr old. Great game and easy to follow instructions. No frustration from my little one while in the car.
0380729407|5.0|Awesome novel; Bradbury is exceptional and the novel is extraordinary.  Unique and haunting. The shipment also came earlier than indicated, which was nice.
B0000TB014|5.0|My children loving watching him sing and dance.  I only wish it had close caption for the lyrics as well.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This was another great and exciting book. You gotta read it. 'Ole Harry is up to his old police actions again, and this time he masterfully closes a 20 year old case involving the murder of a foreign female journalist who was killed during the L. A. Riots in 1992.<br /><br />Only a determined cop like Harry could do this one. Every one else ad given up, but Harry would not!!  And sure enough he tracked down all the leads and got it solved and brought peace to the people in turmoil from not knowing what happened to their loved one.<br /><br />It's a good book you will not want to put down. If you are like me, you buy and read all M. Connelly books.  I can't wait and he usually does not disappoint. This one is definitely width the time and you will turn each page anxiously awaiting the next!  Go for it!
B003O86FMW|3.0|I guess this book had to hold all the info to keep the story going. Still a great book and will force you to start book three immediately
B004TTZHBK|2.0|They are ok meals.  I'm not thrilled though.  I tried a few and moved on to somethign else.  I don't think I'll use it again.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Really good book. Now we have to wait until may to read the second. Wish I had noticed before hand. May is such a long time away
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The first book of the series was great.  The other two.... eh.... Seemed like she was trying to hard to get people involved with the characters.  The first book however is a must read (much better than the movie).
B005PK56TA|5.0|Show is the best!! I would recommend purchasing it via Amazon for the best value.<br /><br />I find that the latest episodes are available day1 where other networks (Cable) make you wait a week.
B004YEJGEO|3.0|Not bad.  I played it for a while, but lost interest.  For what it is, not a bad game.  I would say worth a try if you are interested in this type of game.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|Watched this season with my Girlfriend over a period of months. We liked the first season better overall but this was entertaining nonetheless. I'd recommend watching that first though it is not required because this is a completely new integration of the cast members.<br /><br />Season 2 does not build on Season 1.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have bought this game on so many platforms!  I still play it.  To me this is one of those must have games.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Kids and girlfriend love this game, its easy to play and very progressive.<br /><br />I would recommend downloading it for a try.. minimal ads.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Pretty much what you would expect from Mahjong.  Nice graphics.  Runs a little slow on older phones, but it it works.
1416549447|5.0|I can truly say that this has made my running more enjoyable, more pain-free, and much more of a learning experience than just a way to suffer through exercise. I've applied it's principles to other areas of my life as well, including biking at the same cadence I'm running (180 bpm for me).
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I bought this since my daughter wanted it (she is 12).  After listening I would recommend this band to friends.  They have some pretty addictive songs.
B005F9CPG8|5.0|Great old songs since I grew up in the sixties, always looking at old stuff & everyone wants to know where I get these, there GREAT
0684857219|3.0|I was using this more for a guide on workouts.  I'm not planning on doing any type of competitions.  That said it is a good book.  Lots of good workouts and recommendations.  It is a little dated however, but still a very solid foundation.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I like Rod Stewart anyway but this is a really nice Christmas Album. Don't hesitate to buy this one. Great!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like Kindle.  It is a great concept.  I wish amazon wasn't quite so stingy with sharing books and what not, but it is a good step in the right direction.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Get this game only if you are willing to lose large portions of your<br />productive time... immersion is total, resistance is futile.
B004YXE438|2.0|Was cute when I first got it, but not enough so to keep my attention.  There are better ways to waste your time out there in my opinion
0739313126|5.0|Even though I had read the book when it first came out, listening to this unabridged version on CDs was just as &#34;gripping;&#34; an amazing book!  An excellent reader!
B0055S348W|4.0|Simple app.  Nothign special.  It performs as expected.  Not sure what else to say about it.  If you need something like this it is worth a try.
0156027321|4.0|The author has an amazing imagination and kept me interested the whole way through.  I can't wait to see the movie!  I heard it's excellent too.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|This alsmost feels over engineered.  If you want a simple click, look elsewhere, if you want something that do a lot, I guess this might fit your style.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I really want to try it out but if you had a free version people would get it and mabye I would be willing to buy the full version
B00785P2QC|4.0|A little slow going. Making it tempting to purchase coins. Requires patience if you are not interested in spending real coins. Still fun to play.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I thought the movie was good and it displays the history very well.  i think New Orleans was displayed well.
B005LAZKTK|5.0|although i have had vol.1 for years [30+] i just got this after a recommendation from a friend. vol.1 in it's day was a ground breaker and brought the dead MANY new fans. it was a big hit before the dead really cared too much about hits. vol.2 is more great music from the europe tour and[ after listening to some of the cd's from the new \\"complete box\\"] more of a true representation of what went down those 2 months in europe . vol.2 is layed out very much like a dead show cd would be, shorter songs 1st set etc. the recordings themselves are excellent and the playing top notch. there are several cuts which feature pigpen nicely,which were alittle scarce on vol.1 so you will enjoy those..disc 1 is first set material;; you can check the song list in the description above right here at amazon. disc 1.highlights for me are , good lovin, and  playing in the band. these 2 songs capture the sound and energy of the bands playing on this tour nicely; pigpens blues chops and the bands relaxed jamming..disc 2 is second set stuff,highlights:: dark star/drums/the other one, is superb;;a nice long jam which highlights the band at their improvisational best.  for anyone who doesn't want to spend all the $$ for the big box set,it's a great way to sample more europe 72. a nice addition to anyone's collection.. enjoy !
1451695187|5.0|This book was eye opening as neurological doctors are very scientific. This book was truly from the heart and make a lssting impression on mime.
B0099092QU|2.0|Slash released one of the best pure rock albums of 2012 in \\"Apocalyptic Love\\" and has found a perfect front man in Alter Bridge vocalist Myles Kennedy. It was an album full of rock swagger tracks, the type of rock music that Slash has always played so well. It has so many standout tracks including the single \\"You're A Lie\\", the brilliant classic flamenco style of \\"Anastasia\\" and the funky opener title track \\"Apocalyptic Love\\".<br /><br />But here is the problem I have already bought this album twice; the first edition was the Classic Rock fan pack which was much like the release for his self-titled debut in 2010 and also the Cd/DVD combo that followed for its official release.  Now what do we have? Well we have the same album repackaged with 3 extra discs, which would be great if it was extra tracks that maybe didn't make the album or a live unreleased CD but what you get is a DVD performance of his \\"Made In Stoke\\" DVD which was a brilliant performance, that same DVD was packaged with a two disc CD of the same show but for this release it's been edited down to one disc! The chances are if you are a Slash fan you will already have all three of these discs. So what is the selling point? It's a DVD of a show recorded in New York which would be much better suited to a single DVD release on its own rather than bundled together with a box set, at the very least they should make the DVD available to but on its own as Slash fans will have all the other material already. There is also a booklet which is a nice souvenir but is really one of those look at once type of things.<br /><br />So just like Slash's debut album for which there were at least five different versions of the same album it seems that \\"Apocalyptic Love\\" is getting the same treatment. I wouldn't be surprised if next year the record company release yet another version next year. This is becoming an all too common trend with record labels releasing different versions of the same album in the hope that the die hards/collectors will have to have it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book was just as exciting as the first.  I was completely surprised at the ending.  I can`t wait to start book three.
B00322PK2G|3.0|Chose this watch for a friend as she requested a swatch for christmas but I don't like the plastic band as it's very stiff.<br />May return item if my friend doesn't like the band either.  Other than that, it's a plain swatch that arrived on time.
141659521X|5.0|This is another winner from Vince. He has never published a novel that was not great. I reccomend all of his works!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love to play is game &amp; my son loves to play it also.  you can play in the car on the long rides that is great.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great way to spend a few spare minutes. I like how you can deal a winning hand if you wanted.
B0018LMKIK|5.0|I like music from 60´s and 70´s.<br /><br />Sale service was outstanding.<br /><br />Package was arrived in good conditions and on time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't usually review DVD's but I felt the need to write something down for this series.  I had heard so many things about Firefly for years and years from various Sci-Fi fanatics like myself.  I held off on buying it because I had so many other things to catch up on.  When I saw Science channel was having a reunion special in November I decided it was about time to get it and see what all the fuss was about.  Dear lord all I can think about for the last 2 months has been Firefly and Serenity.  I can finally see what an injustice was done to this incredible series.  I had been a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel and just had no idea what took me so long to watch this but I am just so glad that I have jumped on the bandwagon and have become a true browncoat.  For anyone who doesn't like science fiction then this is the perfect series for you.  While the majority of the series takes place on a  spaceship  the heart and soul is in the characters.  A perfect character study of a diverse but equally interesting group thrown together to form a family. In space.
B000007492|5.0|I bought this album because what I had was scratched.<br /><br />Sale service was outstanding.<br /><br />Package was arrived in good conditions and on time.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|In the description it is indicated that you can add music to use as an alarm or to play until you fall asleep. I cannot figure out how to add the music and I can't find any instructions to tell me how. I've clicked on the settings button and add music but there is no way to add any of the mp3's on my kindle to be used by the clock. No way I can find, anyway. Where can I find instructions? I am getting a little tired of being told an application is intuitive and instructions are not needed. That's bull.  I am tired  of buying apps apps that don't do what they claim.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|A very good movie and it was in fine shape; played very well.  And, it arrived in a timely fashion.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|pretty simple but quick and fun.  good mini games but pretty easy hidden objects.  easy to play on breaks and graphics are good.
B00005QATY|5.0|This product played very well and we really enjoyed the performance.  Unusual George Clooney role but he excelled in it.
034544678X|5.0|My Australian Shepherd is a high energy dog, much like the Border Collies McConnell is raising and training. I cannot even say how much she has helped me in training my Aussie with her priceless advice and insight on the dog's perception. To be a good dog trainer, you have to become a better human. You have to understand dogs from their perspective, which McConnell tells us is much different than ours as humans. She bridges the disconnect while exemplifying the mysterious and strong connection we humans have for our canine counterparts. One of my favorite things about McConnell is her writing style; the woman is smart, yet she writes in a clear, concise way. I love her stories and exmaples, which starts off each of her chapters. She isn't one to put herself on a pedastool; she tells us of her own faults and mistakes, but shows how she changed and corrected her shortcomings, and encourages us to do the same. Some of the best information I gleaned from this book includes:<br /><br />-Taking the space. You can learn this from herding dogs; just watch how they move their sheep. When we take the space from our dog, instead of using our hands (aka \\"paws\\") to push them away, the dog understands that we are the one in control and respond much faster.<br /><br />-How to redirect unnecessary barking. This is a huge one for me as I have a very vocal Aussie and often wondered how I should redirect her barking and let her know that I find it unnecessary. McConnell explains how to do this without shouting (which, unfortunately, is such a human response to barking!).<br /><br />-She explains how dogs are pack animals, and how the alphas in the pack communicate. Things such as eye contact, body blocks, and body posture all effect this. MConnell explains how your dog is very sensitive to your movements. Leaning toward your dog puts pressure on him; leaning away takes the pressure off. Never would I have paid so much attention to this, but now I am so grateful for this insight.<br /><br />-Being a quiet leader. Dogs naturally respond to those quiet and orderly alphas.<br /><br />-Teaching your dog to \\"come\\" by using their prey drive to follow you, teaching them to \\"mind\\" their manners at the door (this has tremendously helped my Aussie, who used to rush out the door every time), teaching them \\"that's enough\\" when they need to lie quiet after a long day.<br /><br />-When NOT to repeat commands over and over, which is a common mistake for us humans who depend so much on the vocal. Also the importance of using hand motions with your commands (remember dogs are very visual).<br /><br />This just scratches the surface. For any dog owner looking to improve their communication with their dog(s), or how to find constructive and positive training tips, this is a jewel of a book.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Ordered for our son an he was very satisfied with the set as well as the price. Anyone who is a fan would love this set.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This isn't the typical teen romance novel. It is very smartly written, insightful, and honest. The dialogue would appeal most to those with a more dry sense of humor. This book, at times, says what many people are thinking but are too afraid to say out loud about grief and hardship. Overall though it is surprisingly not that depressing for the majority of the book.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Hundreds of people say &quot;oh its a great game you should get it hehe &quot;the game is terribly bad I honestly its just sad $6.99 is a RIP OFF! Don't make a mistake.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Music is not my first love. I enjoyed a flirtatious relationship with it as a kid and still have my high school crushes that I drag out of my CD archives and reminisce with on occasion. I rarely even listen to music in the car, which limits my exposure to both the good and the bad that new artists have to offer. My wife fell for &quot;Little Lion Man&quot; first and spent a weekend playing it non-stop, introducing me to Mumford &amp; Sons. Rather than making me crazy it in intrigued me and I told her to get the album. After hearing &quot;Sigh No More&quot;, I was completely blown away. This is the first album since my high school dalliances that affected me emotionally. &quot;Sigh No More&quot; is a great album that I feel is on par with Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten&quot; and Tom Petty's &quot;Wildflowers&quot;. All three of these albums are more than just a single or two, they are albums that are worth listening to from beginning to end. Thank you Mumford &amp; Sons for making music exciting and new again.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie for all ages.  Gru is the best.  My daughter just laughs and laughs when ever we watch it.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|This is a cute movie worth watching with the family. Although its not an all time favorite hit it defintely has some funny parts that make it worthwhile. Its also one that has a reasonable story line to it.
B005529EI2|5.0|So many scenes made mroe sense after seeing the extra footage.  It was worth the extra time for true LOTR fans.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun for those that liked the original, yet completed the game and still wanted to play more.
B00915G6WQ|1.0|This will be my last season watching. The storyline began with Dexter in Season 1 being a good guy, now 7 years later he just kills anyone who gets in his way. Debra now joins in this non sense and is now a killer as well- killing Maria in the season finale to save her brother Dexter from being arrested. Dexter falls in love with a poisonist who he ends up saving from criminal charges on a few occassions- even going as far to kill the woman's father. I mean what is this- this show is just sick now. I used to be able to laugh at this show, but now it's just sick and sad.

B0027MJU00|5.0|Of the three Gillian Flynn books, I liked this one best. I should note that it's very lurid, and themes of child molestation, devil worship and a family massacre aren't for the faint of heart. Yet the narrative style -- first- and third-person -- is captivating, and it's a true page-turner. Different perspectives are presented, past and present, in such a way that, at times, made it hard to put it down for the day. And the way it ended was, to me, satisfying. I'd recommend it with an enthusiastic thumbs-up.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|of course we love these movies. LOVE LOVE LOVE having them so compact - looks great - we've had no problems with them.
0060523808|5.0|When Gerstner took over IBM in 1993, it had a arrogant reputation, an immovable hierarchy, and was 90 days away from bankruptcy.  Gerstner announced his ascendency to CEO with the words: \\"A customer is now CEO of IBM.\\"  Having sat in the helm of both Nabisco and American Express, Gerstner had dealt enough with IBM to understand it as only a frustrated customer could.<br /><br />Gerstner's two great insights was his recognition that 1) IBM's greatest strength was its people, and 2) IBM's greatest weakness was its culture.  He attacked the antiquated and entitled culture by immediately ending the \\"jobs for life\\" rule, and laying off countless workers in bloated, nonstrategic business units.<br /><br />Gerstner shows a real understanding of how important IBM, as a singular institution, is to the world in general, and the United States in particular.  Interestingly, Gerstner pays tribute to the life-long IBM'ers, saying that he was never really \\"one of them.\\"  He does so in a caring way, that flies in the face of all the attacks on him by bitter IBM'ers who had been let go.<br /><br />In the end, this book is an outstanding portrayal of the fearless vision and dogged discipline that a true leader must have to be successful on the world's biggest stage.

B0085YNML2|4.0|This game is really well made and has cute characters. Even the objective to swing through flowers by your toungue to get to your meal is challenging the further you go. I think kids older than 6 would probably enjoy this more due to some complexity such as color changing that my son couldn't always keep up with. It didn't hold my attention or his for long and has gone to the cloud. I still think its a good game and love the lizards walk ..adorable!<br />Florida Mom
B006LSZECO|3.0|The first 90% of the book was completely amazing. (Great characters, interesting story, twists and turns) The last 10% of the book was a total disappointment. I felt like the author just gave up on the story. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it ended differently.

B009ZAY8MM|5.0|The sound is undeniably PTX, but it's clear that they approached their Christmas album with a sense of reverence (which seems to be missing from most contemporary holiday albums, sadly).

B000SEJHRA|5.0|I love the way he writes! I couldn't put the book down. So glad my professor recommended that I read his work.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|In my review of the last Pendergast novel, I was truly on the bubble and thought that the character and series had jumped the shark...this latest story Two Graves confirmed that suspician, alas.  It was a good character and series once, now fallen to bare mediocrity.<br /><br />The story starts at where Cold Vengeance left off: Pendergast discovered his wife is alive afater a very bizarre and convulted plot involving Nazis and global conspiracies.  All the main characters make an appearance here:  D'agosto, Heyward, Constance, along with another story line involving Ms. Greene, Pendergast's former ward.<br /><br />If you are a really die-hard Pendergast fan, you might tolerate this well.  If not, don't bother.  My specific issues:<br /><br />1.  In the first twenty pages of the book, Pendergast does some pretty unbelievable things that caused me to shake my head.  First, he is a rush to drive 600 miles and rents a sportcar...he apparently averages 125 miles per hour in getting to his destination.  Now I suppose you can do this on the Autobahn in Germany or Texas panhandle but seriously??? No traffic at all? And no stopping for gas (which KILLS your average).  Umm okay.  Next, he fires an assault rifle at an SUV one-handed riding full speed on a Ducati motorcycle, wounded no less, and causes the SUV to leap over a mound and explode -- what is this, Miami Vice or the A-Team??? Finally, he needs to bury a body in a desolate location but manages to find a rusty shovel at an abandoded ranch house....riiiiight, like the backhoe had been taken already.  There are numerous gaps like that sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />2.  The Nazi theme is getting a little stale -- these guys apparently a reliving the post WWII lives in Brazil without much advancement (except for major scientifc leaps) into the 21st century...same clothing and close to the same weapons and even vechicles.  Sigh.<br /><br />3.  Pendergast is distraught over a major death in the book and considers suicide.For someone with advanced Tibetan mind training and a ton more deep, mystical analytic thinking, it seems kind of pedestrian...and lasts for ten pages...ugh.<br /><br />The last half of the book is better than the first half but net-net it ain't great.
B004I4M0A2|1.0|I cant believe how poorly this app worked.  I almost deleted it after the first 10 minutes of use.  do not recommend.
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|LOVE this game... so much more interactive than the first 2 games...the 3D rollercoaster rides are a welcome addition.  helps to know the cheat codes =) so you never run out of money!
B0034JKZ86|1.0|From a multi-racial family, this movie disappoints on so many levels.  Unlike Mulan and Pocahontas, all Caucasians are portrayed as fat, selfish, lazy, or a combination of the three.  There's so much more wrong with this movie, but I just don't feel this movie even deserves any more review.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I originally read this because like everyone else, I had to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />The book was a little rough to get into, but by the end I couldn't wait to pick up the next book. There was a lot of repetitive word usage. For example the word \\"murmurs\\" was used a TON in the span of a couple pages and it really started to annoy me. You will notice this often in the first book with various words.<br /><br />As for the S&M angle, I was shocked that it was a LOT more tame then I was expecting. However, the sex scenes were much more explicit then your normal romance novel.<br /><br />I've so far only made it half way through the 2nd book, but I'm hooked.<br /><br />Oh, and as for the movie...I love Ian Somerhaulder, but I think Henry Cavill really should play Christian. He was awesome in the Tudors and could easily play the part.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|I love Sarah Mclaclan. She sounds like an angel. Beautiful songs. I would recommend it to everyone one. Very soothing and relaxing.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|The action is non stop in this movie -- little long and the new female lead is okay her acting was poor, good that she didn't have a lot of speaking. But great action movie to get into!

B00APUYWYA|5.0|The film opens showing us competing collegiate A Cappella groups. The announcers are very snarky which sets the humorous tone for the movie.<br /><br />Female announcer(Elizabeth Banks): &#34;Nothing makes a woman feel more like a girl then a man singing like a boy.&#34;<br /><br />Male announcer (John Michael Higgins): &#34; Women are about as good at A Cappella as they are at being doctors.&#34;<br /><br />There is some battle of the sexes banter always going on.<br /><br />The action then picks up for the following year's recruitment at Barden University. The main focus is on Rebecca (Anna Kendrick from &#34;Twilight&#34;). She is the daughter of a college professor who wants to be a music producer and arranger. She is pursued by Jesse (Skylar Astin) who wants to score movies. They end up in rival groups who all seem to have pun names, i.e. &#34;The Treble Makers&#34; or &#34;The Minstrel Cycles&#34;. The language they speak to each other is also punny such as getting &#34;pitch slapped.&#34;<br /><br />The female group is lead by Aubrey (Anna Camp) who wants to do the same songs over and over again to the dismay of Rebecca and the snarky judges. The movie is predictable and pretentious. It is a film designed for a female teen audience, although I was able to enjoy it as well. Anna Kendrick's make-up was perfect throughout the film, a flawless beauty. The singing and choreography was enjoyable and professional. Perhaps the best scene was early in the film when they had a &#34;riff-off&#34; when competing A Cappella groups ad lib songs in &#34;battle&#34; against each another.<br /><br />The diverse female characters, such as &#34;Fat Amy&#34;(Rebel Wilson) made the film enjoyable. A film you can watch with your teen/preteen daughter and not get too embarrassed.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Sexual innuendos. Some adult/teen language.

B009FB3W9G|5.0|What a wonderful memento of one of the most PHENOMENAL nights of my life!  I was so GRATEFUL AND SOOOO THRILLED, to have been there that night to witness this first hand!  Seeing and hearing my LIFETIME IDOL, Barbra Streisand being honored by so many great artists and hearing them sing her songs was EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY special to me. What an amazing experience just to be in that room!!!<br /><br />Of course, the highlight of the evening was seeing Barbra performing live for the grand finale.  I can't even begin to express what an AMAAAAZING THRILL that was!!!!  Ever since that night, I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out so I could relive that performance OVER and OVER again!!!!  Needless to say, I was REALLY disappointed to see that most of her performance had been drastically cut from this DVD.<br /><br />HOWEVER.... the two songs that Barbra DOES sing on here are SOOOO BEYOND SPECTACULAR, even if those two songs were the ONLY songs, on here, it would make this DVD worth having!  Barbra's renditon of \\"The Promise\\" is one of the most INCREDIBLE performances I've ever seen in my entire life!!!!  That performance has stayed in my head ever since that MAGICAL night, and being able to see it again on this DVD is a G-DSEND!!!!<br /><br />Thank you for another wonderful \\"BARBRA TREASURE\\" to add to my collection!!!!!<br /><br />Robin Lipman<br />Coral Springs, Florida

B00846REIS|4.0|I really enjoyed the fifty shades series so I chose this book. The book was good but a little too predictable. I wish it would have developed the other characters more but was an overall good read. I'll read the next in the series.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Don't waste your money unless your in high school and appreciate pot smoking teddy bear movies!<br />There is not much of a story line and also had a bad quality picture for a high definition movie.

034580404X|1.0|too bad i have to give it one star - these books are terrible.<br /><br />even if you can overlook the countless annoying grammatical errors. the boring mundane unimaginative and repetitive sexual encounters make these books an excruciating read.<br /><br />i don't know if i should feel bad for all those people that unwittingly got cought-up in and bought into this frenzy of a badly written series or feel sad for so many people that think these pedestrian accounts are exciting - they most surely have horribly boring sex lives.
B000VBIGD6|4.0|This is an older film, but it has become an annual holiday favorite with our family. It is enjoyable for the young and old alike.
0307346617|5.0|World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War written by Max Brooks is a narrative based on eyewitness accounts of a fictional zombie war. Brooks is an agent for the United Nations who gathers information on the zombie war from various interviews with people of multiple ethnicities all over the globe. Brooks collects all the information in one report, but the United Nations makes the decision to not disclose all of the information from Brooks' report. The exact origin of the outbreak is unknown but Brooks begins his tale in china with \\"patient: zero,\\" the first person to be infected. Not only does World War Z describe the history to the zombie war, but also gives insight to the state of the world ten years after the end of the war which shows the different changes in government and geographical living.<br /><br /> What stands out in my mind about this book is its new approach to a classic subject. Some people often wonder of a zombie apocalypse and its outcome and just what might happen. Brooks gives his opinions and testimonies on the subject to attempt to plunge the reader into this post-apocalyptic world. What I think is important about this story is the way Brooks puts you right into the action with him using imagery. Brooks' message to the readers is attempting to tell what effect an apocalypse would have on things like government and human nature. I would recommend this book to anyone with a deep fascination with zombies and anyone else curious about what may happen to the world after such an apocalypse.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|What \\"Bring It\\" was to cheerleading movies, \\"Pitch Perfect\\" is to a cappella singing. You may not recognize many of the main characters and you may find the story to be predictable but you will love the music, root for the characters and enjoy the comedy of this movie. At first I wasn't sure I how much I would enjoy this movie but it was absolutely addicting. The soundtrack featured many tunes that you can't help to sing along to, hum or just dance in your seat to. This is one of those movies that will be over before you know it.<br /><br />You'll find yourself rooting for Beca, Fat Amy, Chloe and the rest of the Barden Bellas as they overcome many obstacles, including themselves en route to the a cappella singing championships. The soundtrack to this movie is top-notch. Songs like \\"Don't You Forget About Me,' \\"Oh Mickey,\\" \\"Let's Talk About Sex,\\" \\"Like A Virgin,\\" are a few of the older hit songs that are included along the way, and you will also find some new hits, all done a cappella. When you hear the term a cappella, don't be misled, these are no barbershop quartet singers here. They rock their way through the movie with style and flair.<br /><br />I give this movie 5 stars. This movie has it all, comedy, great music and a very believable, loveable cast of characters. And as funny as these singers are, you'll also be laughing out loud at the judges. Get out your pitch-pipe, warm up your singing voice and sit back and enjoy the show.

B000001Y42|5.0|I was 17 when this album came out.  It has aged very well.  This album, is IMO, the best rap metal album of all time.

Don't be embarrassed or worried what others will think.<br />P.S. I listen to everything from Jimi Hendrix to Eyehategod to Tool to Lamb Of God and I love it all!

0920668372|5.0|This book is not for those who looks for negatives. Yes, the book is extreme and weird. However, it does describe the emotional bond between a parent and a child, uncontrollable. The seller got it to me with a protecting cardboard to avoid bending. I got the paperback edition.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|One of the advantages of living in the era of digital technology is the creative use of it in filmmaking.  James Cameron has directed the realization as film of another world that is visually and emotionally gripping.<br /><br />The three-dimensional showing (especially in an iMax theater) of Avatar was unlike anything that I (as a 72 year-old movie lover that was born and raised in Hollywood) had ever experienced: the terror of ferocious, exotic animals. the thrill of mounting and riding flying reptiles, the sweaty palms of runs along fragile pathways at great heights, the mystical wonder of a huge, and apparently conscious tree that centered all living things and was the spiritual heart of a race of ten-foot-tall blue humanoids. Who else could have done this?  It is a wonder, and we should be grateful.<br /><br />At the same time, the story is a transparent parable of exploitation: of native people by White, western invaders driven by a quest for profits at almost any price, and accompanied by (morally compromised) scientific explorers who are more interested in these other sentient beings than in the objectives of expansive and exploitive industry...yet all too willing to lend their scientific skills to the purpose of their sponsors.<br /><br />As in our earthly history, a few resisting heroes defended the natives.  Except that in this (imaginary) story the heroic resisters actually succeed in helping to liberate them.<br /><br />The movie is both tender and violent.  Delicate, floating seedlings find their way to the skin of our hero and &#34;anoint&#34; him as a deliverer of Pandora, the habitable moon on which the action takes place.  He learns to mount and fly a terrifying and enormous dragon-like creature that has mythical power and meaning for the Navi'i.  He is now both anointed and ordained to lead them in a great and violent rebellion against his fellow-earthlings who have invaded their home.  And he ultimately joins them through the transmission of hisidentity (&#34;soul&#34;?) from his crippled human body to the Avatar Navi'i body that he has temporarily inhabited by means of human technology.  And, of course, there is tender romance, which is portrayed with a quality and a depth that evokes empathy in those of us lucky enough to watch this movie.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|alright, same as my reviews on the previous books, the title of my review is simply a title i think that suits the book fine.  The book was okay. better than the first book but not better than the second.  The second book was my personal favorite i think.  I say this because i feel like this book seemed to have jumped so fast from here and there.  It felt like it was rush. Yes, less darker than the first book (considering the way the main character still engaged on the punishment idea during sex and such) , probably sweeter than the second book, but the pace the author went, it felt like she/he was like here. bam. and bam. and bam. then here's the next. then this. And then the end.<br /><br /> As for the plot, i loved it. it cleared all the mystery, typical happy ending. Yet i raised an eyebrow at the ending, it felt like such a change of character for Christian happened WAY too quickly. like please. its insane. too fast. plus as happy as the ending was, it was so different on how the book has been.<br /><br />overall, book was good, cute even, but there was definitely some HUGE changes there compared to the first and second book. the pace, and the way things turned out (even though it was expected).
B003AVPV1O|5.0|Works well split signal is a bit faded but that has nothing to do with the quality of the product.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Alright, this one was definitely better than the first one. by how much? A LOT. I probably say this because I just prefer this book's story better than the first one. the first one was dark for me. that's why i say the title of this book should be fifty shades deeper.  This book is where sex and romance was mixed well i think.  I mean, this book made me go \\"awww that's so sweet\\" here and there. and especially after having read the first one, it makes you go \\"holy crap\\" the man is trying alright!<br /><br />This book is definitely worth the 10 bucks i spent, and it definitely has its sweet and hot moment, and it still has its drama of course.  Yes there are unrealistic aspect of it but hey. its gosh damn fictional book.<br /><br />A must read! it makes the reader happy they read the first one and continued!
B003SI605K|5.0|I viewed this for a class I am taking at BU. It was a delightful film and I enjoyed discussing it with my classmates afterword. Amazon prime allowed me to view it very cheaply (I think it was 99 cents or maybe $1.99?) and there was no skipping or anything. Sound quality was good as well. Will use again!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Okay, first of all, i wish there was a star rating between 3 and 4 because i think that's where i'll be. Not my favorite but its alright<br /><br />Now the title of my review \\"fifty shades of darker\\" is simply my opinion of what i think the title should be. I found it dark alright. maybe its just me. but there was a lot of darkness in this thing especially the dom-sub thing. the mrs. robinsons part.<br /><br />This book definitely had its ups and downs. The ups are it actually makes the readers go awww when this dark book get all sweet like when Grey is all sweet. Now for its down, i think its the sexual stuff, there was a bit too much of it. i got to the point where i just want to scan through those parts. Yes, there are parts where it makes you go \\"well that was hot\\" and some parts, it makes you go \\"well, ain't that over the top?\\"<br /><br />Now, this was my biggest thing about this book. the ending. after reading the end of this book. it totally made me say \\"what the &$@%.\\" Like what was up with that ending, if it was meant to be a sad ending, there are soooooooooo much better way to go for that route than leave the readers hanging like that. For me, the end felt like it was just the climax. not the end of the first book. I mean okay, the author probably did that to make the readers look forward to a second book but no, the way the ending felt was just weird. it felt like the middle of the book, not an ending.<br /><br />overall, its an okay read. looking for a book with lots of sex plus a story of romance, go and read it then. i wouldn't say the book was bad. i mean i did read the series through my finals week after all. hahahaha. was it worth $10? a little bit.

1451638450|4.0|Bujold has written many (N>14, as she explains in a note to the latest) books, novellas and stories about the world of Barrayar, its expanding empire and its military mad (but not militaristic) culture. Most of these have been about Miles Vorkosigan: a unique and memorable creation - not that I'm going in to that now. Most of the Miles books have also included his much-abused, much-used, much put-upon and much-underestimated cousin Ivan, who now - and I never imagined I'd say this, finally - gets a book of his own.<br /><br />Captain Vorpatril's Alliance opens with cousin Ivan on Komarr, Barrayar's gateway to the universe, doing the kind of work he loves: predictable, stimulating, and entirely without physical risk. Under other circumstances it would also leave him plenty of time for socialising, but the planet's nights are too short for that. Best of all, his cousin Miles is a world away: happily married, newly a father and unlikely to drag Ivan into another adventure. But of course there are other relatives more than willing to take advantage of Ivan's good nature, sense of honour, and weakness for a pretty (and pneumatic) girl. As a result, Captain Vorpatril finds himself making an unexpected and increasingly complicated alliance, digging for buried treasure, gambling for the fate of worlds and - most surprising of all - making his mother happy.<br /><br />Captain Vorpatril's Alliance has no grand battles, few spaceships (serving only as transport), and little of the intrigues and politicking of the other Barrayar books - although this being Barrayar, and Bujold, there has to be a bit of both. It's more reminiscent of A Civil Campaign than the other Barrayar books, being as much a comedy (truly) of manners and morals as anything else. It's a far more likeable and readable book than Bujold's last, and all the more welcome for being so. I'd even go so far as calling it a return to form: cleverly and tightly written, amusing in places, insightful throughout. The pace isn't exactly breakneck but neither does it drag: it draws you in on a pleasant ride to a satisfying, somewhat predictable (but no less satisfying for being predictable) conclusion.<br /><br />Like I said, I never thought I'd see or welcome an Ivan-centred book. Of course Miles Vorkosigan gets a look in - Bujold wouldn't dare not give him a walk-on role - but as I think I've said, in many ways his story is done. It's hard to see where else Bujold could take that wonderful character, short of backfilling imagined gaps in his imagined history. But Barrayar the world and the panoply of characters Bujold has populated it with do offer scope for more. Captain Vorpatril's Alliance makes me hope for more - in a way that Cryoburn most definitely didn't.
034580404X|5.0|The books were Fabulous<br /><br />All three books were exciting, adventurous, questionable, and lovable. Each character had their own identity and brought plenty of drama to each chapter. I could not put it down, each page kept me wanting more. Thank you E. L. James the trilogy was excellent.

This isn't my preference, but I am ok with it. The only problem is, a few programs don't automatically auto-rotate, requiring me to turn my Kindle 'upside down' to view them.<br /><br />Please add 'auto-orientation ' to your next update. Thank you. Aside from this, the program is 5 stars!

B000A6T262|4.0|The Star Trek: Stardate Collection, featuring the first ten Star Trek movies from Star Trek: The Motion Picture through Star Trek: Nemesis. Star Trek: The Stardate Collection puts together the two original 'Star Trek' boxed sets. The 12 discs are packaged in two tri-fold cardboard goes into sturdy cardboard box. Unfortunately Paramount doesn't add any new features to the original sets.<br /><br />The set contains the following:<br /><br />Star Trek: The Motion Picture<br />(My rating 7 of 10)<br /><br />I thought this movie could have been more than it was and ended up a bit anticlimactic, but considering it took years to get Trek to the big screen, it was good just to see the cast back together.<br /><br />Includes Commentary by Michael & Denise Okuda, Judith & Garfield Reeves-Stevens and Daren Dochterman, The Longest Trek: Writing the Motion Picture, Special Star Trek Reunion, Starfleet Academy: The Mystery Behind V'Ger<br /><br />Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan<br />(My rating 10 of 10)<br /><br />To me, the one that all the other Trek movies have to live up to. Great action, great villain in Khan that is played beautifully by Rircardo Monteblan.<br /><br />Includes Commentary by Director Nicholas Meyer, Director Nicholas Meyer and Manny Coto, Original interviews with DeForest Kelley, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and Ricardo Monteblan<br /><br />Star Trek III: The Search for Spock<br />(My Rating 8 of 10)<br /><br />I remember watching the Wrath of Khan and having to wait 2 years or more before they release Search for Spock. Although anything after Khan would have been a let down, this movie still was good overall, albeit with less action than the previous movie.<br /><br />Includes Commentary by Director Leonard Nimoy, Writer/Producer Harve Bennett, Director of Photography Charles Correll, and Robin Curtis, Ronald D. Moore and Michael Taylor<br /><br />Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home<br /><br />(My Rating 6 of 10.)<br /><br />I remember wondering why this movie took a left turn from the previous ones and I was a bit disappointed at the time, but this movie did have some funny moments that brought back memories of the original series.<br /><br />Includes Commentary by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy<br /><br />Star Trek V: The Final Frontier<br /><br />(My rating 7 of 10)<br /><br />Final Frontier is where the crew go in search of \\"God\\". This film was not the best of the series and in my opinion average as far as the series of movies go.<br /><br />Includes Commentary by William Shatner and Liz Shatner<br /><br />Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country<br /><br />( My rating 8 of 10)<br /><br />A great way to cross the bridge from the hatred of the Klingons and the Federation to the cooperation shown in The Next Generation. With the Klingons forced to ask for peace, this movie had all the drama and suspense that Trek has been known for.<br /><br />Includes Commentary by Director Nicholas Meyer and Screenwriter Denny Martin Flinn<br /><br />Star Trek VII: Generations<br /><br />( My rating 8 of 10)<br /><br />The last movie to feature any of the original actors (with the exception of a brief cameo of Spock in the new Trek movie) as a main part of the story plot. Captains old and new meet and work together. Great action with an ending fit for a Captain.<br /><br />Includes Commentary by Director David Carson and Manny Coto<br /><br />Star Trek VIII: First Contact<br /><br />(My Rating 10 of 10)<br /><br />What's better than the Borg. Great action with a Borg Queen that almost matches Khan as a villain.<br /><br />Includes Commentary by Director/Actor Jonathan Frakes<br /><br />Star Trek IX: Insurrection<br /><br />(MY rating 7 of 10)<br /><br />I didn't particularly like the direction this movie was going with the characters. Not my favorite but better than the next one.<br /><br />Includes Commentary by Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis<br /><br />Star Trek X: Nemesis<br /><br />(My rating 5 of 10)<br /><br />A television episode made into a movie. Definitely a disappointment and possibly ended the Next Generation movie franchise. I never understood why they made this movie.<br />Includes Commentary by Director Stuart Baird and Producer Rick Berman<br /><br />Good collection of all the star trek movies, some are better than others as they ruined the last next generation movie.pisode made into a movie.

034580404X|5.0|I enjoyed reading this series.  It is definitely out of my norm but worth the risk.  I can't wait for the next series.  I hear that she is rewriting the trilogy from the perspective of another character.  It should be interesting!
0061122416|5.0|Traveled like \\"Santiago\\" through so many countries and at times, knew not what I would next encounter but some hidden force up there pulled me through. Developed a kinship with him and apart from having read and reread Paulo's masterpiece, those who I recommended it to have subsequently wholeheartedly thanked me.
0345803485|4.0|The emotional dynamics of the narator are well drawn.  However, some of the aspects of the two characters are somewhat unrealistic: Christian with abilities in all walks of life: multi millionaire, knowledgeable about classical composers, rare wines, and a skilled pianist; Anastasia so unaware of her own incredible beauty and yet still a virgin with no boyfriends at the age of 22.<br />  i thought the use of Ana's two subconscious psychis was unique, creative, and provided good insight as well as good humor.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|Great performances, fun storyline and characters. I expected to like it well enough and was surprised to find it even more enjoyable than I'd hoped. There is an underlying passion for the game that reminded me of Bull Durham.
B004AQR24W|1.0|This movie was ridiculous. It was like the Dr. Pepper 10 commercial (where the guys are riding through the jungle in a jeep blowing stuff up) for an hour and 40 minutes. I'll admit, it was nostalgic to see all of the old action heros together, but the plot and storyline were both predictable and stupid. I love action movies, but this one was just stupid. You can blow up an entire island as long as you save one barefoot latina? And the General's spanish accent was pretty bad, too. Like worse than J.Lo speaking Spanish. Glad I didn't pay for this one.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I chose the 5 star rating because Rod Stewart is a great entertainer & performer, & his new Christmas CD really sparkles. Also, Amazon is always excellent in getting the items I order through them very quickly, & in excellent condition!
1576754227|5.0|Basic stuff that we all struggle with.  I bought the audio recording to listen to and was tired of writing it out in note form so I bought the book.  Excellent content and this book is a good reminder.

0766631737|1.0|Why adapt a work of art that is genius into a boring superficial version? It's not as if the original Frankenstein is so hard to understand, as are some \\"classics\\" such as Paradise Lost. It's an easy read and full of poetic imagery. I do not recommend this version. I see no point to it. Even a child could read the original.
8866130931|1.0|I love Moleskin'es but I have to agree with another review here lamenting the loss of the monthly pages at the front of this calendar.  That was the whole point of having this planner--I could see both the month at a glance and make notes for each each week.  Ugh, guess I have to go back to my Franklin Covey.  So sad.

B009TKMOY2|4.0|The reason I put a four star is because we have not watched it because it is a Christmas gift. Everything was in great condition so I have no complaints.
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown is a wonderful writer. They say if you read The Da Vinci Code before Angels and Demons that is your favorite and vice versa. They are both too good to decide.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|This is a fabulous movie with a ton of charisma and fun for the whole family.  It is a one of a kind comedy!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Not a lot new or exciting. Find the hidden objects, solve a puzzle. Go to the next room and do it again. Three to five of each set of hidden objects are a challange. Skip the dialog and you miss nothing. Nothing original &amp; not much of an adventure.

B001U0HBQ0|4.0|Great director, super low price for a Criterion disc, but it is the only Criterion blu I've received that didn't have the &#34;Director Approved&#34; sticker on the front, which perhaps explains why it was so cheap - a packaging error or some such (a warning would have been nice though.) Actually emailed Criterion about this and they said there is nothing they can do, so Amazon must be in the same boat.<br />Anyways, buying Criterion releases is often about extremely geeky library collecting, so what might seem like a very minor or even non-issue ends up sticking out more like a sore thumb. Otherwise a very good addition, but if you are a criterion nerd you might want to try buying it directly from them (I think it was not available when I ordered but has since been restocked.) Reading reviews, there might be some other minor packaging flaws with this version as well.
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|This was a recorded copy, not used as I ordered. I thought this was illegal. I was surprised to get this from Amazon. The movie itself was great.
0316069434|5.0|You can surely recall presenting an oral book report in grade school, can't you?  Most oral reports ended something like *And so, I rilly, rilly liked this book and I'd recommend it to boys, but not to gurls*<br /><br />And that's my Amazon review. I think of the Harry Bosch series as guy's books, because here's a character that the average, middle-aged, middle-class guy can identify with.  Rather than Professor Robert Langdon and his beautiful female companion (expert in all 17 martial arts) boarding a private stealth jet to zoom across Europe in pursuit of an evil genius and criminal mastermind who has planted an N-Bomb with a red digital timer showing the minutes to go; rather than James Bond and his beautiful female companion (expert in all 19 martial arts) boarding a private stealth jet to zoom across Europe in pursuit of an evil genius and criminal mastermind who has hidden a P-Bomb with a red digital timer showing minutes to go; rather than dirty Harry blowing the scum away; rather than Spiderman, Superman, Batman or Gasman, here's a series devoted to a middle-aged, middle-class hero whose only superpower is that he is dedicated to his job, and he's good at it. Those other stories are fine for adolescents. Grownups should be more interested in reality, and Michael Connelly writes the most realistic fiction of today.  To this, I make no exception for the lady authors in Canada nor the Man Booker Prize winners nor the East Coast celebrities. Connelly gets it right: the characters in these novels act like real people, and the reader can easily imagine the dialogue being spoken.  (Usually the narrative is also very realistic, but in this novel, Harry's &#34;vacation&#34; activities are a bit implausible.)<br /><br />Harry Bosch is a man's man, and he is depicted so that us guys feel what he's feeling, think the way he's thinking, and we've experienced personal problems like his. We identify with him.  He is us.  Imagine my surprise, then, to discover that there are just as many rave reviews here by women as from men!  I thought that women were more interested in that [[ASIN:0345803485 50 Cents of Grape]] guy.  Go figure!<br /><br />Harry Bosch is a lonely man. He has trouble relating to people, because he doesn't trust them. We already know that his partner David Chu can be deceitful, so Harry simply uses him as a secretary and doesn't confide in him. His old partner, Kizmin Rider, betrayed him, so she's permanently on his dirt list, too. Several other old partners have been killed off. They lied too. Connelly has featured a corrupt and/or interfering boss in each of the novels, and that's starting to become a bit threadbare, but who of us can't relate to a pain-in-the-keyster boss?  Bosch is in a constant battle against them.  Harry is a workaholic, which broke-up his marriage. He has a romantic interest in Ms. Palindrome, but they're still having trouble connecting.  All Harry has left is his young daughter, but he feels guilt over neglecting her because of work.<br /><br />So it is that Harry Bosch is more than just a character in a popular detective series. He represents modern social isolation. He's a symbol of the modern era -- alone in the middle of a crowd, in the middle of LA. I don't think of Michael Connelly as being the modern Arthur Conan Doyle, as much as he is the modern Albert Camus.<br /><br />As clever mysteries with a surprise ending go, these novels are about average (OK, maybe a little better), but what makes this series so popular is that we readers feel that we're there for Harry. He needs our support, and we're there for him. Because there's a little bit of Harry Bosch in all of us.<br /><br />In previous reviews here , I've written how much I admire Michael Connelly for getting every detail exactly right, but in The Black Box, Harry is depicted as going to a Hz agency and renting a Crown Victoria. Ford stopped selling Crown Vics to the public in 2006, and not many were sold that year. (Subsequent --2007 to 2011-- Crown Vics were sold for taxi and police fleet use only.) Seems unlikely the Hz agency would be renting him a five-year-old car. (I don't blame Connelly for this so much as his staff of researchers.)<br /><br />I've also applauded Connelly as a flawless English stylist, but on page 11, he uses the redundancy, &#34;At one point in time . . .&#34;  Those gaffes should result in a one-star demerit, but I can't bring myself to do it.

B007SO31BQ|5.0|Senna is a must for any racing fan or even non racing fan.  I have watched this movie with several individuals, whom are not racing fans and they found this movie to be very engaging and exciting.<br /><br />Amazon is definitely the best place to get this product.  I couldn't find this DVD in any of the big box stores in the U.S.
B003WUYOQ6|3.0|I read this book while in a frenzy of reading books about health and diet.  The book was absolutely fascinating as it dispelled so many of the myths I've held to be true about 'why we are fat'.  The writing is clear and concise and not only very readable, but also easily understood by the layperson.<br /><br />Although I believe this book to be one of the best of a type, I have one major complaint - not with the book or author - but with the publisher.  I purchased the book for my Kindle.  In the book the author encourages the reader to share the book with others.  Unfortunately, the publisher has seen fit to not allow Kindle versions to be shared in any way.  Having paid a good price for the Kindle version, I'm sorry that I didn't buy the book in hard-copy so that I could do as the author suggests.  This kind of publishing restriction will cause me to think twice before purchasing other Kindle books that could be considered 'reference', and as such, should be shareable.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|A pretty simple product, but it is incredibly well priced at Amazon.<br /><br />This product is an excellent value compared to your big box stores.<br /><br />All of my HDMI cables are Amazon Basics cables.<br /><br />Highly Recommend!!!

For young (not too young, people do die in many episodes, but it is not gory) and adults, you will find humor, action, drama, and all the excitement of magic and the King Arthur era in this.

B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I love hidden object games. This one was good except for if you zoom, it counts as a tap, and again whenever you try to move around in zoom mode. Even if you aren't in zoom mode, the flashlight mode will get you - because everytime you try to move the flashlight section, it counts it. The good part is that it takes a few 'incorrect taps' before it docks you time.<br /><br />Most of the levels are decently timed. Some I had PLENTY of time left, and there were a couple that were cutting it close. Good thing is - if you run out of time you get to try that one again and not have to start back over at the beginning.<br /><br />I have this on my Kindle Fire and it works fine.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|It seems the people that wrote movie reviews (about this movie) missed this:  \\"The Barsoom series INSPIRED a number of well-known 20th century science fiction writers, including Jack Vance, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert A. Heinlein, and John Norman. The series was also inspirational for many scientists in the fields of space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life, including Carl Sagan, who read A Princess of Mars when he was a child\\"<br /><br />This story was written in 1917.<br /><br />So, its not that this movie copied modern day plots, its the other way around.<br /><br />Nuff said.
0553382179|4.0|I am a former S.H.E -- a Sidetracked Home Executive. I read that book 30 years ago and the methods worked well. I followed the principles faithfully for years, until they became habit, requiring little thought<br /><br />Then, in the past couple of years due to life changes and health problems I got behind.  Our home was not a pigsty, but there was certainly a lot of clutter, especially after not feeling well for so long, holding on to 'treasures', holding on to too much, and being fearful money would be tight again and we might \\"need it some day\\". I was behind on everything and embarrassed if someone came over unexpectedly.<br /><br />Even though from my S.H.E days I knew what I needed to do, when I started feeling better I felt completely overwhelmed and I couldn't seem to do it. \\"Where do I start to get my home back again?\\"<br /><br />Sink Reflections uses a slightly different method than the S.H.E. method - i.e. fewer details (3x5 cards, etc., for every little thing).

More than that, YOU'LL change and you will again feel great. You'll be surprised that when you change, your entire life changes, including your family.<br /><br />Yes, the \\"how-to-do-it\\" is available to you in the book, but expect change in you and your family.

If you are struggling, and are willing to be honest about your life and yourself, you'll find the help you need in the suggestions presented in this book.<br /><br />Your home will be ready for company anytime. Honest - ANY time. You really will have more time left over at the end of each day. This sounds too good to be true but it isn't. I'm living proof.<br /><br />Was it worth the money? Yes? Was it worth the time I didn't think I had, to read? Yes.<br /><br />You have additional support online, at no cost.<br /><br />The only negative thing I would say about the book is that it was challenging, at first, to figure out HOW to make a control journal. But, after staying with it, realizing how to do it fell into place 'all of a sudden' and I \\"got it.\\"  I wrote my Journal in a Word document, so it can be adjusted and re-printed as I fine tune my technique.<br /><br />If you're willing to be taught and need a jump start, I recommend what you will learn in this book.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|I bought 5 of these and 2 comparable bulbs from c Crane so I could compare them. The c Crane bulbs were around $25.00 each. I found their light unnatural, the bulbs looked less &#34;normal&#34; than the Lighting EVERs, I can actually see into the c Cranes which isn't very cool and they emit a LOT more EMF than the Lighting EVERs as evidenced by placing an am radio next to each.<br /><br />I'll save my money when I outfit the rest of my house with LEDs by buying the cheaper Lighting EVERs.<br /><br />It's an unusual case of the cheaper product being better (in my opinion and so far:).

By the time the reader gets half-way through the first book and realizes how repetative the books read, many people like me who bought all three books, have already spent the money, making E.L. James a millionaire and wasting their time and money. I'm no prude but have read more titillating and less boring books.

B000XXLY6I|5.0|A great and comfortable boot.  I feel the comfort of it is better than regular Timberland's, and the look is great.  I dod a lot of walking and hiking thus so far they have provided great comfort and durability.  I purchased them in order to get them resoled so I expect the boot to last a long time, a month so far with regular use and they still look new.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|It does what it says therefore i love it. I just wanted it for the movies, nothing more nothing less. It might not include a whole lot of bonus features or anything but It was at a great price considering it was around 100 bucks in stores.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|Compared to the regular Facebook for Android, this app is horrid. i can only view the last 7 posts in my newsfeed. it will not let me see any more than that. it is very slow and clunky as well. The newest update for other Android devices is much better, cleaner, and runs smoothly. This is a sorry attempt.
B009NIJNLW|5.0|I had this DVD and lost it and was determined to buy it again.  I could watch this video everyday.  It was shipped and at my door within a couple days.  Perfect timing!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Not a fan of the style of writing in this book.  The twists and turns were<br />well planned, executed, and entertaining enough, it's just something about the<br />reader's trip along the way that isn't for me.  As the reader, I felt toyed with<br />and used and that turned me off half way through the book; I had to force myself<br />to finish it.
0345535413|5.0|Great book. No clue what the &#34;HBO tie in&#34; listed on the cover has to do with anything.  There is nothing special here in terms of the TV show, this is the book as it always was as far as I can tell.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a fantastic book for anyone struggling in relationships. It's completely change the way I see my wife and children. It sheds a lot of light on why we can't seem to effectively communicate with one another sometimes. My wife is just starting to read it now. I think it's going to make a big difference in our marriage. I highly recommend this book!

0307887448|5.0|This book was more than I expected. There is something for everyone in Ready Player One. It's a great adventure and it's full of geekery. If you aren't a geek, the story is compelling just the same. But being a bit of a geek makes the book better.
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|The qualify of the Blu-ray is fantastic.  However, the digital copy code inside the box is invalid.  The code refer you to Flixter.com to redeem.  When I sign up to Flixter.com to redeem, it tells me the code is invalid.  When I contact them, they said it's up to the studio to give me a new code.  Really?  I recommend you use the DVD or Blu-Ray and rip a digital copy rather than wasting your time to redeem another code.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I thought this was going to have an iTunes copy when I preordered it but I was mistaken. I have tried using ultraviolet but the website is terrible and you cannot redeem codes via mobile devices. I loved the movie despite what some people point out as plot holes. I recommend this for the bluray but I almost wish I just would have bought it on iTunes.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|ok this game is fun but hard if your competive then its easy that's why I gave it a three

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Loved the books, loved the series, loved the behind the scenes.  I am a little bias because I have been reading this series since it came out years ago and am very happy as to how they portrayed the characters.  That does not mean I don't notice what they left out of the books and changed in the movies but all in all I think it is a good representation of the story

B000002UR7|3.0|Perhaps it's the fact that this is Radiohead's first album. Perhaps it's the fact that they started surfacing when bands like Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam were releasing the most popular records of their generation. Or perhaps it's the fact that in the expansive catalog that is Radiohead's, this is by far their weakest album. However, when one listens to this album more than once, it becomes apparent that Radiohead have brandished skill and precision from the very beginning. Even if it wasn't fully realized or developed until later.<br /><br />My long, adventurous journey with Radiohead began when I was in middle school. I was at Walmart with my mom, and was being my stoic self. Checking out the CD's and contemplating whether I should get \\"The Very Best of Cream\\" or this ever-so-bizarre-looking album by an alternative band I had only occasionally heard of- Radiohead. My mom suggested that I get the latter. I heeded her advice. Upon arriving home, I popped in my new CD and listened, not knowing WHAT exactly to expect.<br /><br />The album kicks off with \\"You,\\" a chiming, fiery track that sets the mood for the entire album appropriately. The riffs are clever and aggressive, but the lyrics are just a tad cliched and vague. Thom stretches out his impressive vocal chords about halfway though the song. It's a good track, but not exactly memorable. Next comes the band's mega-hit, \\"Creep.\\" I'll spare the details about this track, since everyone's already heard it a good 20,000 times on the radio before. Although, it is a nice bonus that in this version, Thom uses the F-bomb instead of \\"very,\\" demonstrating his anger. It's a great song, but the fact that most people (who are not true Radiohead fans) unfairly associate it as being THE representative song of the band is frustrating, to say the least. \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" is one of the band's earliest singles. Beginning with a crooked, Joy Division-inspired riff, the song kicks into gear during the chorus. It's a nice, dark track that feels just a tad nihilistic. \\"Ripcord\\" is one of the band's most underrated tracks, full of wonderfully witty pop instincts and a beautiful chorus, although I don't know WHAT the hell Thom is singing about. Perhaps the album's best track (and the one I always listened to over and over) is \\"Blow Out.\\" Beginning with a ringing, finger-plucked minor chord, the verse then slides into a surf-like riff. Thom sings, \\"Everything I touch/ Turns to stone.\\" The song then kicks into a dramatic, wordless chorus consisting of jagged chords that contain all the emotion the band is now known for conveying. After the second verse, the band absolutely EXPLODES into a crescendo reminiscent of The Beatles' \\"A Day in The Life,\\" only much, MUCH heavier. It's a stunning track, and perfectly foreshadows the cerebral tappings of Radiohead's next album.<br /><br />All in all, this album is not mind-blowing. It's also not terrible. It's not a 5-star \\"doozie\\" in any sense of the term. It's also not a piece of trash that deserves to be forgotten by time. This is the first major work of a band that refused to conform to the landscape on which they worked, even if, due to their angst, they were initially labeled as copycats of its biggest innovators. Bottom line: it's definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />Final Score: 3.2/5 (64%)
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Everything about this game, mainly shadow of the colossus, exceeds the average. I think this game fell under the radar but with its new HD reboot the game plays as fluid as ocean water. The story line is impeccably attention stealing and every scene and every fight just increases adrenaline and suspense. Its difficult  to realize how dangerously far this game takes you that you only really notice it when you are finally on top of a flying colossus.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Kids and adults loved it.  Plot fit well with Captain America and folds in other super heroes with a great plot.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|like it just after getting to level 30 to 40 I upated got the zombie part and the samurai part reset

1475143389|5.0|This is a very sound, current, well thought out training program for an individual who is looking for a comprehensive evidence based way to train. Easy to read, written with your gains in mind. I would highly recommend this book to anyone of any age looking to redesign their body and their weight training program for results.
0062200909|5.0|Of all of the recent tie-in books for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, this book is far and away my favorite.<br /><br />This is largely composed of illustrations of the characters, settings, and props from production of the movie, which are gorgeous. There is a also plenty of commentary on the thought process behind these designs as well. Plenty to enjoy for both fans of the world of Tolkien and those interested in the craft of making a movie. However, if you are looking for a photographs from the film, perhaps [[ASIN:0547898568 The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Visual Companion]] would be more to your liking. If you are looking for the illustrations by Tolkien himself, I would suggest [[ASIN:0007440812 Art of the Hobbit]] instead.<br /><br />While not a full-fledged coffee table book, the size (about 12\\" X 10\\") is large enough to do the illustrations justice. There are also two fold-out pieces included. One is a map with glow in the dark runes, and the other is a copy of the contract Bilbo signs in the movie. Both are wonderful additions.<br /><br />This book provides a wealth of concept art from the creative team behind the film and is a great keepsake for fans of Middle Earth and/or film making in general.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|The one constant throughout Muse's career is change.  Showbiz, Origin Of Symmetry, and Absolution have very different feels but are all excellent albums.  Black Holes and Revelations continued the change but, while I still think it's a great album, it didn't seem to have the same magic as their previous albums.  The Resistance had it's moments, but I feel like they got lost in their experimenting.  This is where The 2nd Law remains.  They still seem lost.  There are some good songs but there are more \\"eh\\" songs.  And then there is \\"Panic Station\\".  I don't know what this song is, but it's not Muse and it's not good.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|I really wanted to see this movie mainly because it follows the Bourne Trilogy and promised to be just as fast paced. I gave it four stars mainly because it was slow starting and the editing was a little choppy. However if you sit down and really pay attention you will understand why the first 30 minutes were kinds of slow. Once the action started, it was never ending. My husband is very hard to please and if a movie can't get his attention in the first 15 minutes, he gets up and will refuse to watch it. That didn't happen this time and he sat through it. Jeremy Renner is great as Aaron Cross and really has no clue as to why he suddenly becomes the hunted until he searches for the Virologist that was also involved in turning him into another Jason Bourne. Rachel Wiez is also great as the doctor that foolishly believes the government cares about her after she is the lone survivor of a massacre. Needless to say, she is still as feisty as when she starred along side Brandon Frasier and shows how great an actress she is in action movies. She is easily a match for Jeremy Renner in the action sequences in the movie and Edward Norton is great as the man in charge of &#34;cleaning things up&#34; and will undoubtedly be back in the 2nd installment. There are many unanswered questions but as with the Bourne Trilogy, that too will be taken care of as story continues.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|Before the bastardizarion of Heinlein's classic SF novel  'Starship Troopers', before the self-important rubbish that was 'Showgirls', there was 'Robocop'. Scathing satire, strong storytelling, fine acting, state-of-the-art special effects in the last days before CGI became commonplace, and solid direction make this a film that stands up well in the 20 years since its release. The second disk has two well-made short subjects dealing with the making of the film from both the actors' and the visual effects artists' points of view. (A bit disappointed Nancy Allen wasn't included among the interviews.) Set includes both the theatrical release and the 'longer' version that, I presume, serves as the director's cut.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Yep, they are all here, all the action stars of the 80;s and 90's. I was hoping someone could put all of them together for one big movie and Stallone did it! It is one wild ride from beginning to end with everything you expect from the 3 major stars, Stallone, Schwartznegger and Willis. Yes you will hear &#34;I'll be back&#34; and you will see &#34;Lone Wolfe Mcquade&#34; and terminator jokes will be made as will burning towers. There will be explosions, fights and gun battles as expected... you get it BECAUSE you expect it and that is the beauty of this movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously but you also learn more about the team and the way they interact with one another makes you believe these are men that have seen and done too much together to take each other for granted but will tear each other apart jokingly and enjoy it. Tragedy sends the team after a cold blooded killer played by Van Damme after he takes a box they were sent to retrieve. Saving a village in the process is just part of the journey for vengeance and falls into place wonderfully in the story line.  Liam Hemsworth is great as the newbie and shows why he will follow in his brothers footsteps. The kid is a great actor and falls right in place with this great cast. There is also a sense of sadness because you know this show is the last and only time you will see these great men of action together but take heart, there is already talk about a 3rd EXPENDABLES....CAN'T WAIT!!!

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|By now its pretty obvious I'm a Sanderson fangirl.  He ranks in my top 5 favorite authors and is an insta-I'll even pay full cover price for the hardcover buy.  This isn't to say I think everything he writes is perfect (I had some issues with The Alloy of Law for instance), but by golly his writing makes me excited to read every time.<br /><br />This is his second stand alone novella of the year (after the contemporary mystery/urban fantasy Legion, which I have yet to review) and I think this one fared better then Legion.  Not just because its longer (edited to add: You can see in the comments, EMPEROR is much longer than Legion), but because it played more on his strengths.  The magic system here was as intricate as they come--in about 140pages he conveys a system just as detailed as anything in Warbreaker or The Way of Kings.  Unfortunately unlike his longer epics the information is more or less explained to us instead of organically weaving itself into the plot.<br /><br />That's okay though, this is a much shorter work so I expected that.  This is loosely tied in with Elantris (as in, set in the same world, but not the same characters, setting, magic system or tone at all) and for his eager fans that bloody trickster that runs throughout all his books (tied in with the Cosmere at least) gets his due here as well.  Sanderson approaches this magic system from a more philosophical bent.<br /><br />Forging is, in essence, re-writing something (or in this case someone's) history.  Shai uses it for theft and amusement, but she's highly skilled at the little details other people seem to miss.  She's a perfectionist.  She doesn't just Forge a broken table into a sturdier model, she Forges it into something it can be proud of, something that speaks to its 'soul' and sense of being.<br /><br />By contrast Gaotona, and the whole Empire Shai is being blackmailed into saving (kind of), view Forging the same way people view reproductions of artwork or sculptures.  Its there to please the eye, nothing more.  The debates the two get into are intriguing.  Shai's people believe everything has a soul and its important to respect that.  Gaotona's internal debates on whether or not what they're asking her to do--that is save Ashravan by Forging his soul--is ethical is what makes up the meat of this book.<br /><br />I won't say what the end result is.  Its unexpected in many ways and yet suits the story.  Though many of the other characters are thinly written, and the world isn't as well fleshed out as his previous works, this is still a solid reading experience.  This may in fact be a good book to hand to a Sanderson newbie--its short enough that they won't feel intimidated, but gives a good accounting of his writing style to lure them into his longer works.o please the eye, nothing more.

1932100385|5.0|Great book, although somewhat detailed for the<br />lay person.  The details give basis to the  overall<br />message that you can take control and avoid<br />cancer.  A sound presentation to base your<br />opinions on.
159420411X|4.0|I bought this book primarily because of the interest I had in the issues of polling and political punditry. Silver takes a nuanced approached to explaining forecasting and probability. After completing this book, I have much more appreciation for probability and uncertainty.  The examples used throughout the book, from forecasting weather, earthquakes, stock market, political campaigns, poker and baseball;  are well placed to provide the reader with ample examples of how necessary it is appreciate the need for forecasting and applying probability even when it seems useless.  Although, some sections of the book could have been reduced, it is clear Silver took time to highlight the areas in his life with which he had greater exposure to (baseball and poker). Personally, the Bayes's Theorem is something I will apply to my life and future endeavors.  I recommend this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished Wool  1 through 5 and was riveted to my chair all the way through the stories.  The writing is fantastic, the story hangs together perfectly ... whenever I saw something coming up that might not be logical or realistic, the author anticipated it and created a perfect narrative and explanation that not only was logical but kept the story moving.<br /><br />BUY IT !  NOW !  I'm about to buy all the rest of the books in the series, and then buy everything else that Howey has written.  As a scifi fan,  I feel like a miner who just struck gold !  :)
B000XZ3YH8|1.0|this was the worst product I ever bought, I had to run out at the last minute to buy my granddaughter<br />another guitar, you cannot give a child a product that cannot be tuned when they want to play guitar.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|It's simple and it works. I've gone from thin plastic cases that crack just by looking at them to bulky cases that barely fit in your pocket. This is the best solution I've found so far. It's fairly small and it is made of a soft material that will absorb impact and not crack. I would recommend for anyone who is looking for a simple case.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Just like the PC game but better settings and such. scoring sucks at times but no real complaints on my end.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|It was all like &#34;You're evil. No I'm good! OK, let's run! Look out! Kill the Queen! Annnnnd roll credits.&#34;
B00633W614|5.0|AGAIN a true page turner.  With another feature of Archer' s writing.  That of a Clifton cliffhanger ending preserved till the next book in the series.  I will happily read anything J err ferry Archer ever writes.
1423124111|5.0|I mean it's a really large format and doesn't fit on my bookshelf.  But I don't care because it's awesome.  It'd be a great addition to any collection or coffee table.  Great to just leisurely browse through.
0553057006|5.0|One of those books you wish you'd read decades ago had it been available. A great deall of good information anyone who has had toxic parents and those who want to prevent becoming one.

B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Just obsessed with this game!  I get lost playing it for hours.  And thankfully I don't have to log on to a home PC anymore - it comes on my iPhone and Droid.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|This movie is a great movie and I'm glad I bought it.  I would recommend it to any person. s
B000FC1AGG|4.0|This is a fun, light read.  Just the thing to read after you have been weeks on some of the other-takes-some-time to read.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|good character development for outsider types on the fringe of reality, however, picaresque and lacking substantial meaning for the use of the watcher's time.
B000ID37RM|5.0|How could this be anything else but 5 stars?  Along with the book, this is a necessary watch. Enough said.
0307279189|5.0|It was great to hear theories of why we are meant to be endurance runners. Also enjoyed the insight<br />into the reasons injuries may be attributed to the advancement of running shoes. A must read for those<br />who want to enjoy their running even more.

B00632HWOG|1.0|On the first release of 2.0 the app worked great on my Fire HD 8.9 After the last update, the app will not sync my contacts. It works fine on my Android phone, but not on the Fire.
B007C9N4H8|2.0|Not much plot. Not really worth watching overall. A few cute songs, but basically a waste of time and talent.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The blue ray version is the best! If you close your eyes you swear that you are right there .<br />Would highly recommend this to any Zepp fan

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw movie first but probably enjoyed book more because of it. Going to proceed with next two books in the series.
B007NZDES0|5.0|I loved this DVD & the packaging was very surprised that I also got a CD to play in my car<br />perhaps it was part of the original packaging ( I probably overlooked that )<br />Great packaging GREAT DVD &  CD , will definately buy from this vendor again<br /><br />Happy Holidays & Happy New Year  !!!!
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Many items way too small.  Several misspelled words.  Some grammar errors.  Don't like having to start over when I exit in the middle of a level.  Graphics OK.
B003FSTN52|5.0|DVD was of excellant quality, absolutely love this vendor<br />Top notch DVD's with great packaging!!!<br />Happy Holidays  !!!  Happy New Year
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|I love comic book heroes, especially Batman. I have a home theater, so I rarely go to movies and when \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" became available, I was torn between buying and streaming. Fortunately, I decided to stream because this movie is not worth owning and here are two reasons why:<br /><br />1) Poor quality audio. With all the special effects, you'd expect sounds to be exploding all around you, but not only were my surround speakers quiet, the dialog was either muffled or too loud. I could hardly understand Alfred, Batman mumbled many of his lines, and Bane's voice boomed way out of proportion.<br /><br />2) The story was stupid. I realize these movies are adapted from comic books, but come on - there has to be some believability and logic. I won't go into details because, if you're reading this, you probably haven't seen the movie, but be prepared to both scratch and shake your head throughout.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved loved loved the book until I got to the end which was a huge let down! there are lots of twists and turns to this story and I would still recommend it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|you know what this is great its free and I love it I am young and so I like to see what is going on and this works if you are reading this GET THE APP
B0015USNCQ|5.0|I found this to be a very sturdy piece of equipment.  It is build of stainless steel and the handle is strong unlike some of the other french fry makers I have tried that were plastic.<br />The blades are easily removable and is easy to clean.  It cuts the potatoes extremely well.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|Despite the fact that the show was cancelled halfway through the season, you DO get some resolution at the end. (Unlike Firefly, sob.) The last couple episodes are rushed, but that's understandable, and they are still excellent.<br /><br />Unlike the first season, there is no slow start to Season Two. You get to learn more about Victor, Sierra, and Adele, whose story arcs are touching, and Topher, whose arc is devastating. This season also delves further into the metaphysical questions posed by the show, such as the nature of memory, the self, and the soul. And, of course, they draw back the curtains on the Rossum Corporation.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My husband liked the second season better than the first season.  I like them both and I an excited for the third season to be available soon!  The production is historically accurate in a basic sense.  It is not history lesson, it is a drama set in the early 20th century, so there are a few goofs but so what...this is a great story of a family evolving with the times.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the greatest thing I am so hooked!!!!! Don't do much else anymore. You should at least try it.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I love Rihanna's new CD.  Enjoying listening and dancing to her music all night long.  I'm sure all her fans would love this CD.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This is one the greatest films ever made.<br /><br />Obviously, this movie is not for everyone. By this point in time, word is out that this movie is incredibly complex, difficult to absorb, and unlike anything you've ever seen. This is a large part of the reason the film \\"flopped\\" and is considered to be a waste by many (meanwhile Michael Bay's 'Transformers' franchise continues to gross in the bilions). From a film-student critical analysis, the movie fails because of it's refusal to adhere to many of the standard movie tricks that keep the viewer oriented...or even interested. The movie has no discernable rising action, the movie has no climax, and the movie certainly is void of any traditional resolution or conclusion.<br /><br />The reason I feel that this movie is such a triumph is the same reason I feel I lead a fulfilling life. I strive to live in the moment...to view my journey in life as exactly that: a journey. Life is about experiencing, not arriving at a destination. Sure, Cloud Atlas's six stories very cleverly interweave similar events ands themes throughout; a reason why repeat viewings are not only advisable but absolutely necessary. There is also the fascinating acting and makeup from a set of actors reprising similar characters in each of the six stories. This feat alone is awe-inspiring as to how perfectly executed this was. MY point is that these stories are told with such mastery that the movie succeeds so completely if viewed from the perpective that it isn't necessarily going to \\"arrive\\" anywhere. It doesn't have to. I found myself hoping that the movie would never end, that the stories would just continue being told and experiencing all these beautiful moments...as that is where the most true joy of life itself comes from: experiencing this moment.<br /><br />There is so much to be said thematically about these stories and the artful way in which they are told and then retold: human kind's triumph of it's kindness over greed, karma, the desire to be free, the tragedy of bondage, the inevitable progression of technology and it's consequences, the existence of deities, the urge to survive, and most of all, love. I am writing this having seen the movie only once. After a second viewing I suspect I will take notice of even more clever connections between the stories and characters, and the same for my third viewing and so on.<br /><br />Anyone who dismissed this film as \\"overly-complicated\\", \\"confusing\\", or \\"disorganized\\" has simply not yet arrived at the realization that life isn't about some grand finale. Learn to be present, then you will see the genius of Cloud Atlas, and hopefully, life.
B001F6TXME|5.0|this is perfect for what we needed to do astrophotography since we can't use the wireless shutter this is the perfect item
B0021L8V0M|3.0|I enjoyed the two extra cuts very much, especially the directors cut. Great Movie.  I bought this as a replacement for one I had had for several years.  That dvd would stop repeatedly in the middle of the movie.  I finally replaced it with this copy and after watching this dvd the third time, it stopped once in the middle of the movie.  I think perhaps a different dvd version of Salt would be preferable to this dvd.  I am puzzled by both dvds freezing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great. Nice to have so many options at my fingertips. I would totally recommend this for anyone needing simple computing. thank you!
B006KX3GXO|3.0|I like this app allot, the only thing that sucks is not being able to connect it to my FB account.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|This game is so cool,the scenes are even moving while you are searching. Was 1 of my favorites on Nook. PLEASE make this available on my new Kindle Fire HD as soon as you can!! Fun to play for a little while,then come back to it and look again. You may see things you missed the first time. Highly recommend fun for all ages!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|With this game you can build a town and collect pets; which usually requires spending some time earning money. Once you have pets you can feed them, bath them, and play with them (which is only a game of ball that loses its fun after a while). Despite only being able to do the same three things over and over my daughter loves it.
B004ZN9RWK|4.0|Never listened to this type of music but upon hearing some of it, bought it and find it very interesting. My son was surprised I had the CD as he liked it when it first came out and I was singing classical music. Good is good no matter the genra.
B00932H1HG|5.0|It took a couple times of listening to this album to win me over, but it has big time.  Might be the best yet!
B00957T6X6|5.0|I got this series because I watched the series and everyone knows the books are always better than the movies.  A great read!!
B0013O123Q|5.0|I saw that some lads put 1 star on here for it, saying it's too violent and the infamous rape scene was pure s***. Well, I am here to tell you that if you ever watch a Gaspar Noe film then what you are in for is not only shock to the eye, but to the mind, body, and soul. This is not for intended for viewers with a weak stomach, or immaturity,or pure shock value. There is so much more to a Noe film than gore and galore. You will see the same concept with I Stand Alone and Enter the Void, the less violent of his filmography. To the person that said they didn't understand it or was really confused, it's really not. You simply follow the sequences as if they were beginning to end instead of reversed. The point to this is, one simple word, anticipation. This film starts out extremely violent and does not let up at all throughtout the entire film, and everything you think you know, you don't because there's always a surprise waiting in that next chapter. Since everyone has already written a review and has given you the synopsis, then I am not going to give it to you again knowing what you already know now. Just prepare yourself for the real world. It's cruel, evil, nefarious, twisted, and unpreparing. He does not hold back and never glorifies any situation, even the party scene. It was uncomfortable for me, and when they make love. Every scene effects me many different ways. I have hatred for someone \\"forcing\\" me to watch this, but it's myself that wants to be on the same level as Noe. I will say this, it never ever gets easier to watch. I have probably seen it 15 times hoping I can get through it without closing my eyes and being so enraged that I can't do anything to help. It's an experience you will never forget but do not mistake this film for it's taboo subject matters. There is an actual point to it and if you can't figure it out, than Noe's films are not for you. Watch at your own risk and despite the rumors of the 10 minute rape scene, there are other scenes thatfeel just as horrific as the main rape scene. The end, knowing what you now know, makes this gritty film worse than you expected. ENJOY!!
B009JBZH54|4.0|Great blu ray set!  Very inexpensive and good quality.  Can't beat getting 3 great movies like these on blu ray!
B0001CNRS4|5.0|a film incredible with a very good actress Jessica Alba.<br /><br />I 've chosen this rating because i've completely fallen in the film.<br /><br />I liked the danse scenes<br /><br />i recommend it
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of the best super hero movies made to date!  Great action and visual effects!  EVen better on blu ray!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|A very nice package deal with all the Alien movies. I love that it's a nicely done box set in Blu-ray. I bought this as a gift for a cousin and it was a great deal.

B00555X8OA|5.0|Mr. Kahneman's does a superb job taking laymen through his research into human thinking and decision making process.  It is interesting and insightful, helping the reader understand the human decision making process and appreciate its power, challenges, and shortcomings.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Like many have complained about, you only get about ten feeds. I now don't use the app and instead go to FB through the web browser. This app needs fixed soon.<br /><br />Update 12/30/2012: the app is working as it should now. Loading all my news feeds. Glad that it's been fixed!
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|I was glad that we got to find out what happened to Flynn and the ending was great I hope there will be a third movie
B00962341U|4.0|First off, I have to complain on how difficult it was to obtain this CD in the US. This CD had to be purchased online and US iTunes and Amazon didn't even have it on MP3s. So when I got this CD, I was excited to hear it. This CD contains a different style from Leona's previous material. This CD is more of a dance CD, if you are into that. I prefer her ballad style, but overall the CD was still good. I would must rather listen to her last two albums though.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|Awesome movie great cg for the time fame this movie was made glad they finally released it on blue ray
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is one of the best movie collections I have ever seen. Recommend this Anthology.
0316228532|1.0|I absolutely loved the Harry Potter series and was eagerly looking forward to J.K. Rowling's first book targeted to adults.  What a terrible disappointment.  There is no spark to the story, the characters are small minded and dull, and there was simply no engaging hook.  I plodded through 75 pages hoping it would get better, but finally I just had to end the madness and stop torturing myself with this book.
B008DL466C|5.0|Why is everyone expecting this album to be like prince of the city and kush and oj? its not gonna be like that because he's trying new things. he dropped a cabin fever 2 mixtape for u kush oj fans to get so get it!!!!! prince of the city and kush and oj were mixtapes not albums so hes not gna make a mixtape album cuz no one ever does because they trying to expand their fan base.
067144901X|4.0|We love all of Sandra Boyntons books. This one is a bit simplistic and my daughter was mostly bored with it by 18 months. However it is still a really cute, short read for kids learning their animal sounds! Recommended for the younger kids (about 1 yr)!
1423136802|5.0|When I mentioned that the movie was based on the first of a five book series she was very excited to have me get them.  I don't know much about it since I haven't read it but I have to say, she was hooked from day 1.  A warning though, she found it hard to put down.  She read the whole series in about 2 weeks (this is an 8 year-old with a fairly busy schedule).  So if you're looking for books to keep them busy for a while these are not it.
0671449028|5.0|We love all of Sandra Boyntons books! This one was one of our first and still a favorite. Our daughter loves all the silly rhymes & fun pictures!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I bought two of these sets for Christmas presents. I have not seen the documentary. I have heard very good comments about it.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My friend go me hooked on these games and now I can hardly stop playing.  I had not realized how popular this game was until I started seeing so many items in the stores related to this game.  Really fun.

030746363X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3BBH5KSKHIA5L]]The 4-Hour Body is one of the most insightful guides for anyone interested in learning how to \\"hack\\" the body to get in shape on a busy schedule or just wanting to learn cool things about the body not previously known.<br /><br />There are a few things I want to point out though relating to the negative reviews and criticism (some of which is completely valid).  As a fitness author and blogger myself, I encourage people to take everything with a grain of salt and see the bigger picture.  This includes any \\"hype\\" that all someone needs is a few hours a month to get their dream body.  I absolutely believe this is possible, but this requires intense effort.  This book is not to be read as a lazy way to get fit.<br /><br />The exercise recommendations in this book are intense by virtue of the fact that one must trade high intensity effort for less time committed.  Also, don't expect to gain 30 pounds of muscle in 30 days.  It's not realistic for the vast majority of people, but the take home point is that high intensity training can be effective (it's not my preferred style, but it works for some individuals).<br /><br />Some people have pointed out errors in Tim's experiment methods and conclusions.  This is to be expected and I should note that having studied health and fitness for the past 9 years, I've yet to study one expert who hasn't at one point made a few mistakes in their learning and experimentation process.  Sometimes this is inexcusable and leads to seriously problematic conclusions, but in Tim's case it very rarely invalidates the recommendations.  There are minor points of disagreement, but the majority of what Tim shares is valuable as it's based on what has been tested by real people achieving real results.  Just be sure to separate mentally what is Tim's observation alone vs. the observation of many trainers and studies.<br /><br />There is so much information here it's almost overwhelming.  I've found very few books in all of my years of research that offer this much content and entertainment for this price.  I've spent so many years gathering advice together and putting it into my own books that I know how much time and energy are saved by having everything one needs in an easy to reference guide vs. having to sift and sort through tons of conflicting free advice trying to find what legitimately works from the people in the field actually getting results.<br /><br />And a reference guide is what I consider The 4-Hour Body to be.  Something that can be referred to time and time again to pick up insightful tips and strategies.  No book can be everything to everyone, but I admire Tim for coming pretty close with this one when it comes to fitness advice aimed at the masses.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Body is worth the money, but for anyone with disagreements with a few of the things Tim proposes, I recommend listening to the advice of Bruce Lee.  \\"Absorb what is useful.  Reject what is useless.\\"  And you'll find plenty of useful things to absorb from this book.
B00000K3D4|5.0|A fun movie for kids and adults. We updated to DVD as we have the VHS and still enjoy the movie!

0385523394|1.0|She seems to be a very narcissistic woman. I felt it was inappropriate the number of times she describes herself as good looking. I was specially annoyed at her narrative regarding her \\"perfect\\" body parts.<br /><br />I honestly think that the book would have been more interesting if she had given a more humble account of her experience but instead it is as if she wants to emphasize at every opportunity that she is the most loved, beautiful, skilled and educated lady on the face of the earth.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book. Not just because of the comments above but also because I when I was done reading it I felt like I had wasted my time. I was about to give up reading at some point but I didn't because I think that the only way to give a fair review is by reading the whole book.
B000YHC9WQ|5.0|American History X is a film that grabs your senses. The message is raw, the acting is spellbinding, behind it all is lesson for its viewers that perpetual hate solves nothing. This film is not for the faint of heart, it earns its R rating, but anything less than the graphic portrayal displayed would be an injustice to the message.
075669812X|5.0|My son loves this encyclopedia. It has tons of information and it is very entertaining. The pictures are very pretty and the description for each character is very detailed. Awesome purchase.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that you can change to different versions. I really enjoy the daily verse. It's super convenient and I enjoy the devotions.

B004A8ZWWE|4.0|I like Huge Jackman as an actor and the movie was very good but not one that I would watch over and over. I would rather have just rented it.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|it took 2 hours for it to load. plus it  would repeat every time I play it.<br /> The pets  you have to a foreign to get one pet. the game is a waste of<br />time.

B000VBIGD6|5.0|This movie is a must for every home around the holidays. I've already watched it this season and I was so happy to have received this movie in the mail. Simply Awesome
0439023491|3.0|The first book was amazing. The story was original; multi layered, had good in depth characterization, and was very quickly paced. It was also an easy read, not 5000 pages thick and full of fluff and filler. And while I didn't really expect the sequel to be as good, I was still somewhat disappointed. It almost seemed as if the author threw together the plot in about 5 minutes. And I was also kind of put off the last third of the book was essentially a knock off of the first book. Why throw Katniss and Peeta back into another hunger games? Been there, done that. Collins did her best to give it an original flair by making the arena much different than the first, but it still had a repetitive feel to it. One other problem I had with both books is that I'm not quite seeing the logic Collins is explaining. The purpose of the games is supposed to be an act of suppression and emotional domination. How exactly? Doesn't having peace keepers and keeping the districts in fences do that already? I would think having the games would only incite further anger from the districts, not quell it down. Why not portray the games strictly as a form of cruel entertainment for the capitol? Katniss and Peeta are both allowed to live and be crowned victors rather than kill them both. Why exactly? It seems as if the reasons for many plot turns are almost fed to us and explained in great detail because the logic just doesn't quite add up. Still these books were quite good. Very rarely will you find a novel without at least a few flaws, and these two were entertaining, though the first one was better. I just started the third one last night, and so far so good. Check out these books.
0446585041|1.0|I love Ellen's Show and I think she's one of the funniest women around. So I was looking forward to read her book... and got very disappointed. This book was just another way for her to make more money. It's funny at the beginning but it's getting old after the first few pages. She just takes random subjects and writes 2 or 3 pages about it; the chapters have no connection at all. You can tell that she just tried to \\"fill\\" as many pages possible. For example her chapter about Meditation: 4 blank pages!!! I wouldn't mind that much if her book had been 4$ or less... but paying the prize for a \\"real\\" book (where every page is written on) is just too much! DISAPPOINTING
B004GYY714|2.0|...but I couldn't receive anything. Then again it my be a network / phone issue. I just gave up and uninstalled it to save memory.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This game is fun.  The graphics are beautiful, but the same objects are used repeatedly.  I would love to see the hidden objects be less obvious.  That being said, for a free game, you get waaay more than one would think.  It is a fun hidden object, differences, mystery, and story game.  Beautiful graphics and loads of game to play.  All for free!
0307744434|5.0|I loved this book.  It reminded me of \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\".  I thought it was great and would highly recommend it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Outstanding in every way. Picture quality, sound, even the way it is packaged. In a word, Excellent. I had to add a few more words just so I could submit.  NOT COOL !!!!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I love this the movie was awesome so i just had to have the soundtrack!!!!!!!! Couldn't have asked for anything better
030758836X|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet but I can't wait to see the conclusion.  I won't spoil the story for you.  It is not a who done it but there is a mystery involved.  One of the best reads in a long timr.
B0086700CM|4.0|its very fun I do recommend. it is very cool sometimes it can get boring but other than that its very fun
B000UZ4EP2|4.0|there's a certain level of sameness to most selections. The &#34;sound&#34; is beautiful, Moya's voice, the background vocals, even the instrumental accompaniment for the most part. I think it's a good, pleasant, CD to listen too but not as much more than background music.<br />Playback on a top quality sound system would be a good idea, tiny ear/head phones just don't do justice to ''Signature''.<br />Just three selections have any lyrics that aren't English:<br />#4 &#34;I will find you&#34;, Moya's version of the tune Clannad is listed for on &#34;The last of the Mohicans&#34;, it has &#34;Mohican&#34; and Cherokee.<br />#12 &#34;Gone are the Days&#34; has some Gaelic.<br />#13 &#34;Pill A Run O&#34;, Moya's arrangement of something Irish traditional - all in Gaelic.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|how do you not like it if you looked at the pics you will know if you would like it or not.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|There isn't anything that this story misses.  It is endearing, heartwarming and funny with fabulous performances from the extremely experienced actors who hit the mark in each of their touching roles.  I only wish a screenwriter would produce a new script for a continuation of the story because you care so much for the characters, that you want to know what's happening in their lives even after the satisfying ending!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|The flick had some great one liners and an oddly funny fist fight between a teddy bear and Mark Wahlberg. I would call it a descent feel-good movie, with a fairly predictable story line.
0375842209|5.0|Narrated by Death, taking place during World War 2,  The Book Thief tells the story of a nine year old German girl named Liesel Meminger.  Liesel's mother gives responsibility of raising her to foster parents Rosa and Hans Hubermann.  Liesel soon discovers her love of reading because she was very behind in school. She befriends Hans as he teaches her how to read.  While she lives with the Hubermanns, she also befriends a neighborhood boy named Rudy Steiner, who quickly falls in love with her.  At a book burning, Liesel then learns that her father was a communist. Later she saves a book from the fire, and was seen but not caught.  \\"The book thief has struck for the first time - the beginning of an illustrious career.\\"  Liesel then befriends a Jew named Max who encourages her in her reading.  The book ends with disaster and Liesel barely survives.  Overall a great book that was very difficult to put down, despite some slow moments.

B004NS710C|5.0|I seen this show at the theater. Later I wanted to purchase it and couldn't find it. Looked for it on Amazon and found it right away.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|\\"Homeland\\" is probably the best show on television right now. I was afraid that its second season couldn't possibly top the first, and it didn't....but it's still unbelievably fabulous. I don't want to give away all the gory details, but let's just say that as is always the case with this show, nothing went along as I expected it would, and the season finale was INSANE and leaves everything completely up in the air for Season 3.<br /><br />I will gripe for a moment about my only (very, very small) gripes with this show. One, Jessica's character has become even more annoying, and while I sympathize with her plight, she does something with her kids in the next room that should earn her the title of Worst Mom of the Year. Seriously, what was up with that? Second, there is not and never has been any chemistry between Brody and Jessica at all. I guess you can easily explain that by saying that obviously there's no chemistry, because they both changed so much in the eight years that they were apart and have nothing in common anymore. Fine, I get that (though it would be interesting to incorporate some flashbacks of what they were like together before Brody went to war and was taken prisoner). My other gripe, though, is that there's no real chemistry between Brody and Carrie either. It just makes me wonder what their deal truly is as a couple. Are there really feelings there? It never seems like it to me. Or are they just two super messed up people taking comfort in the fact that they've found someone who is just as crazy as they are? I guess only time will tell.<br /><br />Anyway, aside from my ranting...great show, great show, great show! Can't wait for Season 3.
0312576463|2.0|To start off with something positive, \\"Freedom\\" is in some parts an entertaining read, with some witty deadpan dialogue, admittedly mainly by just one character (the musician Richard). It is also a somewhat steamed up window into contemporary American habits and obsessions, and I wouldn't even mind the characters slightly stretching my credulity to make a larger point. However, there are too many conceptual weaknesses to make it the great American panorama it might have been intended to be.<br /><br />Firstly it is not clear to me how the book is about freedom. If anything, the characters seem to have too much personal freedom to know what to sensibly do with, but very little of it in being children struggling with the ghosts of their forebears, being tied up in their neuroses or in being tyrants to each other. The only really free people in the book seem to be some rednecks in the West Virginia mountains, and the main professional activity of the principal male character Walter - although in the name of conserving nature - involves remaking these into suburb-dwelling, mindlessly consuming factory workers, so their former habitat can be exploited. Which exploitation, incidentally, is not limited to the commercial kind, but is also committed by the Walter in trying to bring some sense into his life. Whatever the conclusion is in terms of freedom, it is certainly not a very uplifting one.<br /><br />For a non-American reader, a slightly disturbing tendency is that vices more commonly associated with the U.S. like greed, peculiar sexual habits and not wanting to grow up are easily forgiven, mythologized or redeemed by the syrupy finish of the book. The foreign element however, a young woman of South Asian descent, somehow weirdly combining easy and untortured sexual submission with slightly overbearing competence and efficiency (either Franzen doesn't have a lot of experience with people from South Asia, or is being coarse to make a point), apparently needs to be extirpated in an inglorious and non-redeeming death by car accident, which the reader only learns about circumstantially.<br /><br />Another unproductive element is the pointless Jewishness of one line of characters, which doesn't seem to add to the story either dramatically or in terms of insightfulness. Playing to constituencies? Wanting to mimic Philip Roth?<br /><br />But the most unsatifying aspect of the book is that in the last couple of paragraphs, the tribulations of the preceding 500 pages are essentially rendered completely meaningless by a Hollywood-style ending celebrating the reunited family (triggered, significantly, by the woman asking to be taken back and protected). This finally was the point where I came to the same conclusion as other reviewers on Amazon, that the book might not have been worth the hours spent on reading it.<br /><br />What remains is another justification for the view of the world of the middle-aged American male, and a deep unease about having to deal with issues that do not lend themselves to resolution through family values, charitable community spirit and a reasonable dosis of healthy capitalism.
B00915G6YE|4.0|I was very happy with this season of \\"Dexter.\\" While I don't think Season 7 is as good as Seasons 1-4, it's definitely a huge step up from Seasons 5-6, in my opinion. There are definitely some things about this season that bug me, involving too much suspension of disbelief even for television, but I am willing to look past all that because the good stuff about this season was just THAT good. If I had to sum it up, I'd say that Season 7 really focuses on personal relationships, especially those between Dexter and his sister, Deb, and Dexter and Hannah, a new face who connects with Dexter in an unexpectedly intense way. A lot goes down in Season 7, and the season finale will shock you just as much as the Season 6 finale did. This show has spun off in an even darker, more complicated direction than ever before, and it will be great to see what happens in Season 8. I can't wait!
B0053O89WY|5.0|After 5+ seasons, this show has lost none of it's originality. I can still go back and watch the same episodes over and over again, and I look forward to each new one that comes on!
B009DKFSSM|5.0|global warming rocks.. Pitbull delivers. party down. lots to listen to .. lots to drive to .. enjoyed . pitbull rocks.
B0018RFLQ2|5.0|If you are in the mood for a Hollywood feel-good movie, with an appealing protagonist who overcomes adversity and triumphs by \\"just being himself\\", you can do a lot worse than \\"Searching for Bobby Fischer\\".  In this case the appealing protagonist is young chess prodigy Joel Waitzkin, well-played by child actor Max Pomeranc. Once Joel demonstrates an unexpected talent for chess, he faces a variety of pressures from adults and other kids and ultimately has to figure out his own path forward.  Many of the adults want him to be the next Bobby Fischer and a world-class chess champion (hence the name of the movie), but the tradeoffs involved in doing so may not be what Joel wants to do.<br /><br />Pomeranc turns in a surprisingly good performance for a child actor, delivering his lines well and portraying Joel's emotions through appropriate facial expressions.  Ben Kingsley's performance as Joel's chess teacher Bruce Pandolfini is the other noteworthy one.  The filmmakers sprinkle in archival footage of the real Bobby Fischer, and provide an interesting look inside the New York City chess scene.  They also convey the emotion and drama of intense chess matches, which can't be too easy to do on the big screen.  All this, coupled with an engrossing storyline and an appropriate ending, combine to make a feel good family movie that is appropriate for pretty much all ages.<br /><br />There are some flaws, but they are generally minor ones.  A few of the scenes, such as the confrontation between Joel's father and Joel's teacher, seem a bit contrived and perhaps over the top.  In movies such as this one, which are \\"based on a true story\\", I always assume that the filmmakers are taking dramatic license to stretch or twist the truth in order to make a better movie.  Who can say if the events in \\"Searching for Bobby Fischer\\" are 100% accurate?  Only a few people.  The rest of us should just enjoy the movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is a great read I can't wait for more. I recommend this book to anyone that likes science fiction and the triumph of the human spirit over tyranny! I have thousands of books in my lifetime having grown up without television and would rate this work in the top ten.

0618918248|4.0|First off I would like to state that I was raised Catholic, I even went to Catholic school for many years. I was definitely skeptical of religion before reading this book but never defined myself as an atheist. After reading this book I can say for sure that I am an atheist in some form. I would like to point out that I did not just foolishly read this book and accept every word of it, I did question some of his points. But Dawkins does a great job at stating facts and opinion and giving valid reasons for all of them. He even goes so far as to explain what the contradicting argument would be and then proves it wrong. Though the more scientific parts are hard to follow as the other reader's said, the book is still worth reading. I would definitely recommend this for open minded people religious or not.

0345803485|4.0|If you heard that 50 Shades is erotic fiction and are interested in it because of that, you are correct and should read it.<br /><br />People who bash it are probably the same people who hated Twilight.<br /><br />I wasn't looking for prestigious literature when I ordered 50 Shades. It was exactly what I expected - entertaining when I needed it, so I could just relax and read and take my mind off college.<br />People who were expecting something different might not know what the term &#34;erotica&#34; means.<br /><br />If you were interested, like I said, check it out.<br />It's not poorly written, the plot is interesting, the characters have cool names.<br />Happy reading.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|One of the best if not THE best of the &#34;Zombie Apocalypse&#34; genre.  Empathetic and varied characters, well written and cast.  NOT for children under 12.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|I've read all of Lee Child's Reacher series books and can't wait until there's another one to read.  I bought this one as soon as it came out without reading any reviews, I knew I wouldn't have to read reviews because I know the writing well.  I don't even think this was written by Lee Child, this was the worst book in the Reacher series I've ever read.  I've never written a review before on Lee's books, however I had to say something.  My favorite author is Vince Flynn and his main character Mitch Rapp.  I was so disappointed with A Wanted Man, the story went nowhere, I didn't get the ending, no action, it took me a long time to read.  I usually read a Lee Child book in 2 days and it always leaves me wanting more. Two thumbs down on this one, I wish I could get my money and time back for reading this piece of fluff.  Sorry Lee You've lost a fan.  :(
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fascinating insight into the world of the aristocracy in Britain before and during the 1st World War, after which everything changed for the elite in Britain.  Well written characters skillfully cast.

B009KHDT0C|5.0|Clever, witty and funny.  If you have fond memories of rushing home from school to catch the original series in the 70's, you'll like this.  Played for laughs while holding (pretty much) to the &#34;Dark Shadows&#34; canon.
B0038NN3B4|1.0|I thought that this book would add to the late Dr. Atkins diet book. Boy was I wrong! All the book talked about was how Dr. Atkins diet works. This author is making money riding on Dr. Akins coat-tails.<br />I am disgusted that I wasted almost ten bucks on this book!!

B009GEBBNQ|4.0|A must see for fans of comic genre movies.  Decent story, great sfx, and Robert Downey, Jr.  what else could you want?
B000O599ZS|4.0|I enjoy Wayne's movies but not all of them. The Searchers is one of my favorites. As usual JW fills the screen with his very presence. He is a late returning home confederate soldier with some unresolved personal issues. Gruff, rough, seldom gentle and, always in command. Once home JW still fights his inner demons as well as outer demons i.e. family, religion, indians, mixed \\"breeds.\\" The story revolves around these core beliefs of Wayne's. The cintamatography is well done although typical of how the southwest is usually portrayed. Ward Bond plays a rather 'odd' character but, he does so well. A marriage, fight scene, and party (hoe-down) are all tossed together like a strangely mixed salad, for comic relief, which, I found silly and sophomoric. The movie covers a number of years and 'aging' of the characters is not well managed by the make up department or the director. However, overall the movie is entertaining and, if one is a John Wayne fan a must for your collection.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Worth watching, but not nearly as good as the first two.  A couple of twists but both were broadcast far ahead.  Wait for Netflix.

B0088RQ4X4|1.0|Love the &#34;Barsoom&#34; book series.  This is NOT that.  It's a mishmash of various sci-fi tropes all swirled around with bad acting and a stupid story.

B009NPKTN6|3.0|Worth watching, but wait until it's on Netflix. Funny, great music and a blast from the past for anyone who recalls the 80's fondly.  See it if only for Tom Cruise's performance.

0374533571|4.0|The book was engaging and a good read. I found it somewhat predictable, but was overall satisfied and enjoyed the character development. I definitely would like to see the movie interpretation of it.
B007THA4FI|2.0|From the dark, mythical world of Harry Potter Rowling moves on to the dark and disturbing world of human relationships and its ultimate morphing into what we call a 'Human Society'.<br /><br />This book is filled with too many characters, none of which show us any positive facet of the human race until the very end where one character, out of a long list of names, suddenly stands out to be a hero.<br /><br />Profanity, teenage sex, drugs, backbiting, domestic violence: you name it all and you will find it in this book. I finished reading this book because I hate leaving books unfinished. At the end, though, I was left in a melancholy mood with the feeling that there is nothing good in this world and that it is useless being a Father, Mother, Son, Daughter, Friend, or a Human Being.<br /><br />Not recommended unless you want to spoil your mood
B0095XPZBC|3.0|However, whoever did the remastering really let us and all of humankind down with the shoddy work they did on this season.<br /><br />Granted, quite a bit of it looks and sounds good.  But what looks bad, looks really really bad.  Did they let some idiot right out of university do the restoration?  I actually replaced my hdmi cables and reset my receiver and tv back to defaults 10 minutes through the first episode because I was convinced there must be some sort of hardware failure that happened when I powered it all up.  But no, it's actually just a poorly done restoration/video mastering job.<br /><br />If I did this bad of a job at work, I'm fairly certain I'd be let go.  I wholeheartedly encourage whoever owns Star Trek TNG to fire both the clowns that did this restoration as well as anyone on staff that greenlighted this release.

0380715430|4.0|All of the information is interesting and informative and the presentation is very readable. The only criticism I have is that it was apparently written in the late 1980s or early 1990s and could use an update.
B005LAII1C|1.0|This is Joe 6-Pack's spin on a Spielberg fairy tale movie.  It is neither a humorous blue collar comedy nor a good fairy tale.  Wahlberg is entertaining and there are a couple of funny lines, that's it!  Words that come to mind to describe the rest of the movie; boring, dull and witless.<br /><br />Take a bong smoking, beer drinking Teddy bear who has nothing to do but talk dirty to women and try to get laid and add a lost soul of a 35 year old man who is afraid of thunderstorms and likes to talk about farting and you have Ted.  At best, there is a certain teenage appeal to the movie, but not much.  Perhaps if you grew up in Boston (where the movie is shot) and sat on your Mothers couch all day getting high and drinking beers and did nothing more with your life, this movie is a roaring laugh.<br /><br />It could have been a lot more fun if Wahlbergs character was 18 trying to score a women with a cute dirty talking party-bear and his childhood hero (the flash) taught him how to be a man and helped him get the babe.  Instead both characters are portrayed as losers which the producers try to make seem funny and cool.  The movie, like its characters,  fails to deliver anything more than a shrug.  And why was that weird evil character inserted?  WTF was that all about?  Another failed attempt to bring humor.<br /><br />How do people get all the money needed to produce such junk?  Probably because they can sell it!  Sorry I purchased this.

B002PQ7JQK|5.0|It is Star Trek, nuff said. The picture quality is fantastic and the sound is updated causing multiple surround effects (if you have a surround receiver). The Red Alert alarm sounds as if it is coming from everywhere in the room. It includes the original and enhanced versions. (I prefer the enhanced because it does make TOS seem more up to date.) The episodes are arranged due to air date and not star date but the star dates are listed on the jackets. I always watch at least one episode of Star Trek TOS a week and will watch these from air date first and then I intend to watch in order of the star dates. I am not going to go into reviewing each episode because if you are ordering this or thinking about it you already know what you need to know about Star Trek. I have been watching for this to be on sale for about a year now, I got it for $200.00 by far the most I have ever paid for a dvd/blu-ray set but it was worth it. I have seen every episode multiple times and will see each one again multiple times. I LOVE STAR TREK!<br /><br />Update: 12/31 03:29. I finished watching the entire set and all discs worked flawlessly. As I watched season 3 I wondered if the social commentary from the episodes were the series undoing. Sure many liked what they had to say but that was a different time and attitudes then were MUCH MUCH different then now. There is clearly a sexist tone the series takes (See the last episode (Turnabout Intruder)it says that women are not allowed to be captains in the Star Fleet, something that gives light to the mind of Roddenberry This is no doubt because he was a womanizer.<br /><br />I am moving from this to the animated series which is a cartoon continuation of the series in every way. It is not written(the animated one)for kids (IMHO)and the fact that all but Chekov gave their voices for it makes it easy to envision the original crew members in the adventures. Since this is going to be the highest quality Star Trek TOS version for sometime all Star Trek fans should take the plunge and buy this from Amazon right now.<br /><br />LONG LIVE STAR TREK!Trek fans should take the plunge and buy this from Amazon right now.<br /><br />LONG LIVE STAR TREK!

B00867GHS8|5.0|Nemo and the gang pop out of the screen and the picture is beautiful. A great buy and a fine addition to any 3D collection. I can easily see myself watching this multiple times throughout the year just to watch the 3D effects. The movie itself is great, Ellen DeGeneres should at least have gotten an academy award for her voice over if not the win. Bottom line: If you have a 3D set up buy this movie.

B000QXDFQW|5.0|If you're one of those skeptics that thinks 911 was caused by 12 crazy Saudis, then you'll absolutely hate this film. But just remember that the pilot episode of the Lone Gunman TV series, a spin-off of the X-Files, had a 747 ready to crash into the World Trade Center six months before it happened. I found Arlington Road to be truly credible; frighteningly so. But them I'm one of those lunatics who doesn't believe one word of what comes out of the mouths of politicians or the CIA. I found the DVD, never having heard of it before, at a yard sale for a dollar. I've watched it several times and just ordered the blu-ray version.

0345803485|2.0|Holy crap! There's only two days until the pyjama party I'm hosting.  What can a group of 12 and 13 year old girls do that's different from the usual pj party?  My mom suggested that we do something different from the usual sitting around talking about boys and having pillow fights. But what?  I asked her.  How about writing a book?  She suggested.  You're all smart girls from upper middle class families--some of you even go to expensive private schools.  You can do it. And it shouldn't take more than one night of concentrated thought.  Holy Hemmingway mom--you're a life saver.<br /><br />OK guys let's get started. I'm going to assign two chapters to each of us. But first off we need an overall plot and a couple of interesting main characters.  Well,forget about the plot that may get too complicated--just focus on the main characters and what they do.  How about we have two main characters?  Character one will be a really rich dude,a real hunk,so handsome and sexy that he makes every female that he meets shiver and sweat in his presence--and so rich that he owns a private jet,a helicopter,3 Mercedes,3 Porsches,and a VW Beetle--and on top of that he is an accomplished pianist,writer,painter,scientist--and all this before he hits 30.  Character two--well she is sort of bland,your typical wallflower,nerdy,skinny,sexually inexperienced and very vulnerable to rich,sexy guys.<br /><br />So,let's get started--don't worry about co-ordinating anything--just start writing about all of the super hot scenes that you remember from the steamy romance novels that you \\"borrowed\\" from your mom's bedroom and all of the \\"boy\\" talk that we had when we were young and unsophisticated 10 and 11 year olds--OK get started.  It shouldn't take more than a few hours and when we are all done--we will throw everything together and call our novel--wait a minute let me think--how about \\"50 SHADES OF GREY\\"?

B000FVE3A2|5.0|I have worn this watch daily for almost three years and have no complaints. It has been beaten and banged around and continues to work as advertised. I am considering buying another just like it so I will have one without scratches.
B0030E1XJU|5.0|Great product, but the box arrived slightly damaged!<br />It is a very bad impression, improve it ....<br />I recommend despite this flaw!!
B0033H7VI6|1.0|Was hoping to get this by Christmas. Just want to know when it will be in stock. That is all.

0811879631|5.0|this is a quintessential pixar collector's item, as well as for animation lovers. each movie's color pre-planning is beautifully presented. it even includes pixar's short films.
B00004XPPK|5.0|This movie is good, but it does drag in several places.<br />However, Rita Hayworth is just wonderful. When she<br />turns on those &#34;bedroom eyes&#34;....the lights go out !<br />One of the most beautiful women that ever walked the<br />earth.
1451695195|2.0|The account is amusing but as intelligent as the author is he never addresses just how long or during what time period he might have been having the visions he explains.  Could they have only lasted a few seconds or just toward the end of leaving the coma?  These basic questions are ignored.
B005D81W5Q|5.0|Real good movie it came in four days I ordered more movies sense then Glad I started shopping on amazon
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very exciting, kept me guessing. Highly recommended!<br />The characters are well developed, well spoken and believable. 5 stars. I am looking forward to more from this author.
B00A77II0U|5.0|As usual, Alawar has created a great game! Great story line and fantastic graphics. This game keeps you looking forward to finding out what happened, can't wait till I find the bad guy :),want to keep playing and hate to see the game end, will keep getting Alawar games there fantastic!!!!!!
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This is a powerful book and I read it as much as possible and the concept works.  I recommend this book.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|This is the undisputed best action movie I've ever seen.  The Hulk was incredible and easily the most gratifying piece of the movie.  It's the Hulk you always wanted him to be (fearsome, powerful and uncontrollable).  All the others were written with incredible skill and vision and thrown together masterfully in epic action sequences that seemed purposeful, meaningful and fitting.  The actors all owned their respective parts and everything just fits together in a way that makes you more than willing to cheer out loud in more than one place.  Excellent work from beginning to end.
B00005U122|5.0|I've seen many rock concerts, including several Pink Floyd concerts and Roger Waters \\"The Wall\\" concert, and I've viewed many concert DVDs - but this is the best ever!  Brilliantly performed and superbly filmed, this won't disappoint even the staunchest Floyd traditionalists.  The Floyd music 'shines on' - in most ways authentic to the original performances, yet in other ways updated and freshly interpreted by a stellar cast of musicians.  They look great, sound great, and were clearly having a blast!<br /><br />As a bonus, the mini-documentary provides some insight into the preparations for this tour.  Waters reputation as a curmudgeon must be left in his past with Pink Floyd - for this gig, he was a happy gentleman.<br /><br />Also, this is a VERY LONG DVD, which is great - you don't want it to end, and it almost doesn't - covering most of the classic hits from the earliest days through to a sampling of Waters less known solo efforts.<br /><br />A must have for any rock fan!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Funny concept, executed well.  Seth McFarlane's brand of humor was over-the-top as expected.  As a fan of &#34;Family Guy&#34; I found that I had a hard time reconciling Ted's voice as it's the same as Peter Griffin's (they even make light of that in the movie).  The major plot problems surround whether or not Ted is actually alive.<br /><br />While he drinks and smokes and somehow has sex throughout the movie, he's apparently incapable of just going dormant like the toys in Toy Story and has to get his own place.  Considering what happens, he is also not *really* alive and becoming organic on the inside like Chucky was, so the drive to the climax of the story feels totally fabricated and fake when Wahlberg's character decides he wants to grow up and chooses his girl (Kunis) over Ted and mayhem ensues.  Still, it was funny at several points and worth exactly the $2 I paid to see it.
B00337QJO8|5.0|I saw \\"2001\\" when it first came out. I must have been 11 or 12, and it made a BIG impression! I went right out and bought the soundtrack -- it was the first album I owned. It took until now, buying the CD after all these years, to realize just how brilliant Kubrick was in selecting the music of Gyorgy Ligeti to feature in the film.<br /><br />The Richard Strauss \\"Zarathustra\\" overture gives a superhumanly heroic tone, which is thoroughly undercut by the eerie, tragic \\"Atmospheres,\\" \\"Requiem,\\" \\"Lux Aeterna,\\" and \\"Adventures.\\" Ligeti rightly sued Kubrick for using his compositions without permission, but in the end I hope he was philosophical, given the wide exposure he gained as a result.<br /><br />This particular CD version includes complete versions of \\"Lux Aeterna\\" and \\"Adventures,\\" along with the shortened \\"Requiem,\\" \\"Lux Aeterna\\" and ALTERED \\"Adventures\\" used for the film. The soundtrack is great, though, overall. I'm not a Richard Strauss fan, but the \\"2001 overture\\" is great! And who doesn't like to hear Johann Strauss II's \\"Blue Danube\\" every now and again?<br /><br />Thank goodness Kubrick rejected the score he commissioned, and went with these classics instead.<br /><br />[This is an import version of the same [[ASIN:B0000033WB 1996 reissue]] that I reviewed back in the year -- 2001!]
B006OT03BM|5.0|Brilliant and only 5.000 copies. The three films are massive and the box is sipmly magic !!! thanx to amazon and MBay for this massive collectable box set !!!My Best film is part 3 and the 3d version its an unxpected experience.
B000VYNYN0|4.0|What can I say about the original Evil Dead?  It's a true horror cult classic.  I'm usually disappointed when I see famous film-makers' early low-budget attempts, but it is surprising how well they did.  Make sure you've seen this, an all it's ilk (college kids killed at remote cabin), before you watch Cabin in the Woods.  CITW will be that much funnier to you.
B0053KWDES|4.0|Since I started using my first music portable device, a \\"walkman\\" (yes I'm old) I've always felt that you can not get enough sound from them, and I've owned a lot walkman, cd walkman, MiniDisc, Smartphones, iPods, etc...<br />I bought lately a set of Bose QC15 after years of not being able to listen properly to music in an flight, you always get aircraft background noise, plus the occasional child crying its lungs out. Wonderful, it worked!!! the headphones isolated the noise from the cabin plus presented richer sound, however I felt still I couldnt get the most of the music out the iPod.<br />Until lately i came across headphone amplifiers the FiiO product line and was reluctant to buy any because it meant to carry an extra device bundled with my iPod/iPhone. However, after some some reading of different reviews and considering that the price was worth the risk I got a E11 + the FiiO L9 line out cable, and boy how it has changed the listening experience.<br /><br />So far I have tested it with another pair of headphones I own (Seinheiser HD558) and the sound is crisp and with much detail, plus you can get more juice out of the iPod. I havent tested it yet with my QC15 in an flight but I guess its going to improve the experience also.<br /><br />One thing you need to take into account, this amplifier is suitable to work best only with high end \\"over the ear\\" Headphones, not with the normal earbuds or even thirdparty high-end \\"in-ear\\" headphones. This is because the experience that an \\"over the ear\\" headphone gives you is far better since it wraps the sound over your ears, and somehow creates a sound cage, at least thats my opinion.<br /><br />I didnt give it a full 5 star because the placement of the input/output jacks should be inverted in my opinion, also the volume knob even is very sturdy and balanced should be a little bulkier so you can handle it easier when the device is attached with a music portable device.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful, go for it... its worth it... its worth it.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Firstly the movie felt like it was taking place in the mid to late 1800's.  As well as putting you in the setting, it masterfully wove a secret and realistic (for a vampire movie) battle with the Southern Vampire forces into the life and times of Lincoln and his struggle to free the slaves and reunite the nation.  It had beautifully choreographed action scenes and some decent acting all around.  When I heard of the ridiculous premise of this movie I avoided it. When I finally broke down and watched it I didn't want to like it.  Despite my preconceived notions and prejudices I couldn't help but be entertained from start to finish.  Well worth the watch for the action fan, vampire aficionado, and maybe even the history buff looking for a smile.
B004XZR63M|4.0|A great book to inspire you to make changes. Its also great for motivation. Worth a read, but make your own decisions about investing. Perhaps get some runs on the board investing rather than quitting your job, as I want to do each time i read it.
B0095XPZBC|3.0|Alright, for those of us who know, Season 2 was outsourced to HTV, and therefore some of the remastering, specifically the VFX, are a suspect.  So what exactly is the deal?  Well, here's what I can gather from watching all the episodes.<br /><br />1) The model used for the ENT-D wasn't the same across all shots.  The difference can be seen most noticeably in the deflector dish on the front of the secondary hull.  For some reason, this thing gets a bit blurry as if the whole model was a shotty CGI model...which it may have been, I don't know.  Internal lights are sometimes absent for whatever reason.  Again, I suspect that it's a CG model.  Also the glow of the nacelles and the bussard collector are a bit too much, washing the rear half of the ship with a blue glow.<br /><br />2) The planets.  Quite frankly, most are pretty good.  Only the one blue one with the horizontal cloud patterns is about the only really bad one.  The big difference between Season 1 and Season 2 here is that not all of Season 2's planet rotate (which was a priority for the guy that modeled Season 1's planets.)<br /><br />3) Transporter beams.  THIS IS THE BIG ONE.  It appears HTV did not use remastered HD effects for these.  They appear pretty close to the original low-res versions.  Probably just upscaled versions of the original, and it shows.  Why HTV just didn't use the remastered versions CBS Digital created, I'll never know.  I mean, a transporter beam effect is a transporter beam effect.  Not much difference between who's being beamed in and out.<br /><br />4) Film grain.  Yes, it's true that the film grain is a bit more extensive in this release, but some of that may be due to the different film stocks used in post Season 1 seasons.  They even state in the extras that the first episode \\"The Child\\" that they experimented with different film stocks.  As the episode opens, the first shot of the bridge we get is VERY grainy.  But calms down in subsequent shots and episodes.  So I suspect this is due to the different film stocks.  BUT what I will say is this...due to these different film stocks from Season 1 is that we get a more natural filmic look to the show.  Sure the grain rears its ugly head at times, but the show looks a bit more realistic this way IF...you view it from a distance.  Preferably greater than 10 ft on an average sized HDTV (46-55\\" range).<br /><br />But other than that, I give the set 3.5-stars.  I take off 1.5 stars for the lazy VFX work and not controlling some of the excessive film grain.his is due to the different film stocks.

B00AMBH70S|1.0|This movie jumped the shark.  A distant fourth in the series.  i just wish i could get my $5 dollars and two hours back..
B00632HWOG|3.0|love having access to my mail accounts on my kindle fire. since the latest upgrade, ive had nothing but problems- crashes consistently!
B00012L786|5.0|A host of tremendous performances, a perfectly sensual film noir plot, direction that zeros on faces both ugly and (via Jean Peters and her pouty lips) beautiful. Fellini would have loved it.<br />Nice packaging, great cover. Delivered right on time by the seller in great condition.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|I have read Lucky at least three times and just re-read it again. I was talking to a male friend who told me how horrified he felt reading Sebold's book... It occured to me then that I had never talked to a man about this book. It was sad but in a way a comfort to hear from a male perspective that rape is an unpardonable crime. Sad because men who have been raped must deal with the afterwards in a more isolated way than women who need help. Rape is usually perceived as a female trauma (even men raped in prison receive little or no sympathy... seems like many people just feel that it is just part of being incarcerated). My friend is not to my knowledge a rape survivor. Just a great friend who understands my ptsd and panic attacks, my anger at weird times and my fear of being too close to anyone; sadly that often includes my husband (he just can't seem to talk about it... it's in my past, is about as close to the subject as he can get).  One thing about this book is it sticks to you, once a person shares their rape story they stay in your mind. Empathy and admiration of Sebold's ability to tell her story and take the power away from her rapist stay with me. I wish I had had the strength to go after my attacker. It's over twenty-five years for me now. I would be more coherent if I was typing on bigger buttons... but I hope I have at least made it clear that this book is a conduit and a helpful tool for survivors and their family/friends.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game!! It is the best game in the world! Give minecraft a shot you will like it. I made 15 houses in less than a day. I have minecraft it is awesome and you should have it too!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so fun. kids love it. great way to keep them entertained. love the game selection and the simplicity of the app.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|very addictive game.  needs a tutorial,  I played for a month before figuring out the power-ups. 16 free credits a day is great.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I bought this at a very low price and would do it again. The movie quality is fine, but the case is flimsy and plain. I paid for the movie though, so I don't really mind. Just a slight disappointment. Again, would buy again for that price.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|LOVE IT!GREAT TIME very please with this company! will be purchassing more in the future! thanks you so much! very happy
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It was  interesting to me the imagination some people have to make up a story like this.  I recommend it and plan to watch it again soon.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I play this everyday, I love this little game. It's not like some where you have to buy to actually get anywhere in the game. Yes it gives you the option but it's not pushy. All in all a fun little game.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Its longer than season one but it was so much better than season one . If your not drawn in by this series by this season. I don't know what will
B003O86FMW|5.0|I got hooked by the movie and found out there is so much more to the story. These are well written and entertaining books.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|You can't go wrong with Legos.  We bought this for our 4 year old family member.  Sure she'll love them as much as our 7 year old does.
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|... a bit pricey.  Don't really need the book.  Just wanted the CDs, DVDs, and LPs.  Very nicely packaged though.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love this film! Carell is great as the villain you love to hate and the minions are hilarious. The kids are adorable but I'm scared how the sequel will do. Here's hoping they have as great of a story as they did in this first one!
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game, I just wish I could move the card to the card I want it on without having to do it twice, this is my favorite game.(as the moves are counted against me)
0439023491|5.0|Similar to Hunger Games, this book is very hard to put down. Flew through it in three days and unlike the first book in the series (which I finished nearly five months ago), I'm ready to dive right into Mockingjay.<br /><br />I was curious how the world would change and how book two could grab my interest like the first one, but Suzanne Collins does a great job with a fantastic twist (that I probably should have seen coming). I loved this more than Hunger Games, probably because I knew most of the characters and understood the bleakness of the world Collins laid out so well previously.<br /><br />It's hard to review this without giving too much away, but it was certainly an exciting ride with a slow build-up. It makes me very sad that I didn't get to watch the movie a second time before it left theaters. And that's about all I can say about it right now, because I'm dying to start book three!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|So much great music, I don't Need any other Beatles albums. The re-mastering is a huge plus as well.  I would buy this again.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Gaiman does a fantastic job creating this world of gods, both old and new. It's been years since I first read this, so it's hard for me to tell how this &#34;author's preferred text&#34; edition differs from the original paperback I bought before. It's an enjoyable journey following Shadow, the ex-convict who gets stuck in the middle of a war most of society is oblivious to...<br /><br />The America Gaiman presents is detailed beyond belief; I really want to visit House on the Rock someday!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Thank you very much! It is just what we wanted! Happy Holiday to you and yours!<br />I will order from you again.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Picked this up on a super sale because why NOT own the ebook?! Haven't read it in years but Palahniuk is one of my favorite authors so I wanted to own this on my Kindle to re-read some day.  Definitely one of his best
B002BWCJOA|5.0|Thank you very much! It is just what we wanted! Happy Holiday to you and yours!<br />I will order from you again.
0439023513|4.0|Another super fast read (I love YA lit!)--only took 4 days...<br /><br />I can see how there was a lot of backlash toward this book and the way it ended, but I didn't mind the ending. What bothered me more was the difference I saw in the character of Katniss. I was reminded a lot of the whiny Harry you encounter in Half Blood Prince (what is it about 17-year-olds?!) and it seemed out of character from the strong Girl on Fire I knew in Hunger Games & Catching Fire. She constantly was doubting authorities (whether it was new characters she just met or even old friends like Haymitch) and sometimes the internal struggle you read through was just difficult to plod through.<br /><br />But the final third of the book is a great adventure as exciting, brutal and heart-wrenching as any of the previous Games we've seen. Part of me wonders where Suzanne Collins comes up with some of these things!<br /><br />A very good conclusion to the story with a nice epilogue that is only hurt by the annoyance of the main character's thought process throughout.
0920668364|5.0|I used to read this book when I was a young kid, and now we bought it for our 1 year old daughter.  This book is so sweet and makes my husband and I tear up every time we read it.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift, I know they will love it. It was a requested item for Christmas.
0399226907|5.0|we love this book, and so does my daughter!  It arrived quickly after we ordered it, and the board books are a great idea for young kids.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|Good story and acting, with not too many predictable elements - though there were some that are common for the monster movie genre. The film has heart, even towards the beast at the center of the story.
B0042MDAL8|4.0|You're not going to be showing this off to your friends on your new surround system, but maybe if you're kids or even wife enjoy the series they will be pleased.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|not sure who enjoys this more....me or my 6 year old. we fight over whose turn it is. thanks! just want more coins.
0439023513|5.0|I really hope they don't decide to turn this into &#34;Part 1 and 2&#34; in theatres, but a book with a great conclusion can always be provided an anticipation as such.  A must read.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Goes to show that Rod only gets better with age!  He is timeless and has a unique take on each Christmas song!  Loved every minute of it!!!
0439023491|5.0|I was hoping that a good trilogy of books wouldn't be simply turned into films just because of the trend, rather I was very surprised that they can be enjoyed entirely separate.
0887081770|5.0|I love reading the reviews of people complaining they didn't know the book was small.  Well if you did what I did and didn't bother to read the product specifications then of course you wouldn't know.  I'm not about to complain about my own mistake.  The product specs do tell you that the book is 4&#34;x5&#34; in size.<br /><br />Outside all that nonsense, it's still a nice book.  It was wonderful artwork and an interactive book.  A wonderful addition to our Eric Carle collection.  It would have been nice to see all the artwork in a larger format but I enjoy this book nevertheless and so does my child.
B00005JLT5|5.0|They say the worst events in history we wish to forget, but of all the evil, all the pain, there is always a smile wanting to burst through the seams.  This tale put Brody on the map and is still his finest performance.  I cannot believe we allowed this to happen in the history of our civilization, but I know that documenting these times will hopefully allow us to never live through them again.  You will cry but also of happiness at the end.
B003WGM40S|1.0|This isn't a love story. It's a study in how religion screws with people and a public service warning against being born before the 20th century.<br /><br />The technical execution of the film version is well done, but the subject matter is relentlessly, cartoonishly, bleak.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|This was the film that originally made me go with HD-DVD.  Batman Begins is truly not just a super hero film, but a wonderful work by Chris Nolan.  Excellent sound, dialogue, picture quality is excellent.  This will become a classic masterpiece like vinyl.
1451695195|5.0|I found this book very interesting.Because, I am not in the medical field, it went little over my head with the medical parts but, I thought he was very thorough with his total experience here on earth and with the afterlife. I saw him in an interveiw on AfterlifeTV.com and on Oprah and I had to get the book. Everyone has a different NDE and I loved reading about his. I thought it was a wonderful book and very well written. It is one of many I am reading about NDE. Thank you Dr. Eben Alexander for sharing your experience. I found you very interesting to read about. I am so happy I read it. I am telling everyone I know ( that is interested in this kind of thing) about this book. Thank you again for sharing you story.
B000RC2EH8|5.0|This isn't the best TMNT film, but it was also a nice hidden surprise for what I thought was going to be a boring reboot.  Excellent cast and picture quality is amazing.  But hey why are you still buying HD-DVDs?
B005CWRB44|5.0|I keep this as a emergency light in my truck. It is SO BRIGHT.  Twist, Medium, Twist, High, Twist, Low. I am VERY happy with my purchase. Its actually pretty rugged! Takes 1 CR123 Battery. Lasts a good while. Thanks.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|I miss the days of 80s films, where Tom Cruise began as an icon, and truly one of the best films to this day.
0345803493|5.0|Found this book much cheaper on Amazon, so I bought all three...  Great story, but I'm refusing to watch the movie.. My imagination is so much better than any directors version.  Hahaaaaa
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|Listening to this album, you can really tell just which Beatles tracks were influenced by George, and you will be pleased with his solo work.  &#34;Here Comes The Moon&#34; and &#34;Blow Away&#34; are stand out tracks.
0345803507|5.0|Everyone I know is readying this book (plus the other two), so I gave into peer pressure and truly enjoyed! I purchased all three book from Amazon... I'm a big fan!
0345803485|5.0|Who doesn't love a good romance story? Although the characters are a bit eccentric, it is fun story that any girl should like to read (except those church goers). Book one was my favorite.<br /><br />Thanks for the prompt shipping!
B00005JPLW|5.0|I can put this movie in the DVD player and just watch over and over again.  I'm a big fan of this era, so my opinion is bias.
1451695187|5.0|This is a detailed experience of an educated person who comes face to face with an energy, power and love bigger than himself and how it impacted his life.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for all people, regardless of denomination or belief.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I'm a big fan, so having the complete first season is a true pleasure.  Item was received exactly as stated and would purchase from this seller again.
B000ICXQHE|4.0|lots of action, the plot was good, actors and actresses, just an all around good movie and I would recommend it to anyone.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This item was received sooner than expected.  It's a treat to have this handy when I want to just pop it in the dvd and watch an episode.  Will purchase from seller again.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|This game was fun until the adds kept popping up.  They were annoying.  I understand them for free games, but not when they pop up every few seconds.  Not worth it.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I bought this movie for our department Hoilday party to play in the background during the actual part.  It was a big sucess, now I need to watch it for the first time... Hee Hee
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I love this book it changed my life one day I saw it made reading fun for me so that is why I give it 5 stars
B007KQI1NA|5.0|this is a great way to add GPS if you use a lot of PC GIS/mapping/charting programs - I now use this as the primary GPS on my truck and another one in my boat connected to the PC and driving the primary chart screen at the helm - eliminates the ongoing hairball of interfacing to seatalk or nmea repeaters/bridges etc - I have moved from using the Autopilot in &#34;track&#34; mode to using it only in &#34;auto&#34; mode since I'm never far from the helm and the performance is essentially the same for both modes in the short term - for instance &#34;steer to waypoint&#34; v. &#34;manually bring the heading to the waypoint and then steer to course&#34; is essentially the same difficulty and arguably easier to unwind in the latter case as conditions change - so I no longer bother to drive the onboard autopilot with a PC - that said, using the BU-353 series GPS's makes it ridiculously easy to use many different navigation programs and have reliable GPS at all times - this is a both a great backup GPS for boaters as well as a primary GPS if your primary chartplotter/screen is driven from a PC.
B00309DC1M|1.0|The DVD i received stalled/skipped and we tried to use it in 2 different DVD players. Yes, we took it out and cleaned it and tried at least 4 times. Very disappointed!
0345803485|5.0|This book has more than exceeded my expectations....I have read and re-read it more than once. Looking forward to the movie.
1603425381|5.0|Gained a lot of great ideas from this guide - plus the color ideas combined with the various patterns give you a lot to work with.  Easy to follow.  A must for any crochet reference library.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|Very intriguing 3D maze.  It is just amazing to think how they design it.  Ball got stuck a lot in tight places and sometimes I had to tap it real hard to &#34;un-stick&#34; it.  I didn't want to hit it too hard in case I dent the plastic... Just frustrating.  If I have a choice again, I will buy the original version (easier) for my 8 years old child.  This one just seems a bit to challenging for her to get into it and enjoy.  Still giving it a 4 star though...
B001DHXT2A|2.0|All of my previous experiences with Amazon have been great. I ordered this disc in like new condition so I figured I would have no problems viewing the disc. The movie plays great but the bonus disc is damaged. You can view some of the content but the alternate opening and the thirty minute doc is unwatchable. I tried two different players and I get the same results. I can't always watch my dvds in a timely manner but I figured incorrectly that like new condition meant that I would have no problems. Will not order from this seller again. Thank you
B000CNFC76|5.0|What an excellent movie for all ages and genders. I would recommend this to everyone. I have watched it 10 times and I am not done. Best movie to come along in a very long time. You don't have to be a golfer to enjoy this splindid film. two thumbs up Bill Paxton!
6305546789|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband and he really loves it.  This is an awesome classic scary movie :)
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I had a lot of fun watching this, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some nice holiday entertainment!
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I bought both of my brothers a copy of this CD for Christmas and they loved it.  We are all very big Deftones fans.  Best band of all time :)
B001AQMBKA|5.0|Item as described.  i have had no time to watch yet, so I don't know if it skips or not.  But they keep asking you to write a review so I am.

B00969PR18|5.0|Great app. Routing capabilities have worked like a charm. Impressive stuff. Happy that it's finally available for Kindle Fire after launching on Nook earlier this year.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I really like this app.  It could use some tweaking.  I would like to have more options for sizing and shading of the background.
B001JAFYFG|4.0|Picture is a little grainy.Other wise its a good movie. I saw it the theater when i was a kid.Price is very reasonable.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|It is a great final entry into Nolan's Batman trilogy.  I've watched this movie 4 times already... it was a fantastic bargain especially since it came with both the Blu-ray and DVD.
0316232955|5.0|Carson Phillips is a very driven individual who believes absolutely in his own brilliance and is determined to leave his one-horse hometown. How he goes about achieving his dream of future success leaves a lot to be desired. Blackmailing one's classmates is not the best solution to moving up in life but Carson believes he needs to seize every opportunity. One can hardly blame him because he lives in probably the most spirit-deadening environment imaginable. School is more like somewhere parents dump their kids and is, therefore, stultifying to someone as bright as Carson.<br /><br />I never usually give top rating in anything because there's often room for improvement. In this case and with such a young author, I'm even more firmly entrenched in this idea but, after saying that, I have to admit the storytelling is great!<br /><br />One would never suspect such a sharp, biting wit from someone who looks as angelic as Chris Colfer. That's a brilliant mind hiding behind those famous eyes and I believe we have much more to look forward to from this talented actor, writer, singer and (whattheheck?) movie producer.<br /><br />Colfer has written a story that I only hope is not typical of teenagers nowadays. I'm not naive so I know that much of what he's written Mr. Colfer has probably experienced first-hand. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even with knowing ahead of time the ultimate outcome and I would recommend this book for both young people and their parents. Parents need to understand what kids are thinking and feeling behind the once-guileless eyes of their nearly grown-up babies.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book in a laugh-out-loud way but that didn't mask the underlying sympathy one would feel for someone like Carson. I'm encouraging my young 'uns to read this book and plan to definitely pay more attention to their (often hidden) school life.
B005LN2Y1Y|5.0|It's cleverly done, beautiful to watch, fun to watch and includes young and old people. I especially like the parts where the dad was secretly dancing.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|It is rare when I pick up het romance these days and mostly because I want to say that I have read some of it. I usually satisfy my need for het romance storyline when I read urban fantasy.<br />Courtney Milan is one of the few authors whose books I do pick up and hope that I will actually enjoy them and she rarely dissappoints me. This book was a joy to read for so many reasons. First and foremost there were so many times when I expected that the familiar trope will end with the familiar conclusion and it just so did not and it was a delight to read. The heroine is a wallflower? Sure she is, because she tries so hard to be due to scandal in her past, but the reason for the scandal in her past? I bet you will not find many books with THAT reason for the heroine to want to keep a secret. The hero is intrigued because he is thinking that heroine is not somebody that she tries to show to the world? Well, yes and no. See, he does see who she is in a sense that he sees pretty fast that she is intelligent and interesting to him and no, she does not become a miraculous beauty at the end.<br /><br />The hero? Oh my god. Granted, as I said I do not read a lot of het romance, I doubt it occupies five percent of my monthly reading, but surely there are not that many books where the character in historical romance does what he does in his spare time. Obviously he has a tortured past too, but what pleased me so very much was how he DEALT with the traumas he had and what he had tried to correct.<br /><br />What I loved the best though was the interactions between the characters - so very adult even when they were hurt and there were potentials for silly misunderstandings.<br /><br />Really loved it.
0316069434|4.0|If you like the series as I do, this will be annother enjoyable read.  It would be great if there were more real stories in the news about law enforcement willing and able to show that dedication.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a compelling story, great visual descriptions and character interpretations.  The end was thought provoking.  Can't wait to see Hollywood's version.
B0000521G4|5.0|Very fast delevery on time. This is a very funny movie. I remember watching it @ the movie theater. Lol
B006O2QNOU|5.0|As a pro trader who knows the operaton of trading rooms and the darkside of ibanks well, with personal experience of the bloodbath kind of layoff and of trading i-kill-you-later/they-kill-you-later (accumulator/decummulator) type of toxic stuff every now and then in the last 2 decades, I love this movie much. The whole cast played well and portrayed the scripts perfectly. Nevertheless, I must warn potential audience that you will very likely be disappointed, as my family and non trader friends were. There's no climax, no hero, no extreme villain that one can hate badly, no big secret disclosed, nor any dramtic ending at all. It's like an art movie that goes for the awards but for sure it's not going to win any for its commercial positioning. Yet, if you can savor a movie as what the reality is, dont miss it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is crazy fantastic, the puzzles are challenging and creepy. I've gotten so hooked I can't put it down!  Plus, I have yet to run into any creepy clowns which is a definite plus.
1608871452|5.0|This book is an awesome compilation for any fan of the show. It's filled with goodies such as posters and postcards. I've been a fan of the show since the beginning and this book is a top quality collection of photos and information. Makes a great coffee table book. Highly recommended!

B004SEUJK0|5.0|I love this movie because I always felt so silly and awkward as a girl and during my adulthood.  Everyone seems so smart around me and I realized that I am smart in other ways.  Bridget is so silly.  I can relate to her!

0062200909|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3NEH6CDAGA4D9]]This is a wonderful companion art book for the movie. In some ways, I like it better than the ones from LOTR.<br /><br />The cover is beautifully embossed with texture and shine. It's 208-pages and big. Behind the cover is Thorin's Map that you can tear out from the perforated edges, and at the back is a long gatefold of Bilbo's Burglar contract should you want to read the fine prints to see what Bilbo has gotten himself into.<br /><br />There's a generous amount of concept art included that feature the characters, props and environment. Yes, it's all fantasy art, and they are all very beautiful and detailed. There are art from Alan Lee, John Howe, Dan Hennah (production designer), Richard Taylor and many others from Weta Workshop. The book is all art and there aren't a lot of photos, so you won't find behind the scenes shots and there are only small thumbnails of the actors in makeup.<br /><br />The majority are mostly character designs and the related, such as costumes, weapons and other props. There are Bilbo and his entourage of dwarves, trolls, goblins, and creatures. Each character has many designs variations shown, but mostly from the hair and facial hair -- probably more hairstyles that you can find in a hair saloon brochure.<br /><br />The environment art are mainly of close ups of locations and interiors. There are a few of those wide shots as well but could have been printed bigger. Many of the nice textured pencil drawings are from John Howe and Alan Lee.<br /><br />Those who like production design will enjoy the insightful commentary. There's lots to read and often, there will be a few designers talking about just one character, about the design, clothing and their weapons. The extra information gives more depth to the characters.<br /><br />The back cover mention something about this book being the first in a series of hardcover books. So unless they are referring to the other film companions, it means there would be art books for the next two films as well.<br /><br />It's a fantastic artbook. Highly recommended to fans of the film and fantasy art.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)s for the next two films as well.<br /><br />It's a fantastic artbook.

B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Come on Nolan ! I expected much more out of you. The batman in this movie is not coherent to the batman in the previous two, and specially the cartoon I grew up watching. As an example the batman in this movie *Spoilers ahead* gets beaten down in a fist fight with Bane. And later beats Bane, again in a fist showdown. Not the batman i know. The batman we grew up watching could take down the evil wonderwomen without laying a hand on her. Batman is known for his super smart brain and his ubber awesome gadgets. I am sorry but this movie was disappointing.<br /><br />On a different note, the movie has tons of holes and devise plots. It just became silly after a while. Police officers trapped in the sewers but not even taking uniforms off(wow Gotham has some shit ass dedicated cops), and ready to fight all inspired on release(not a bit tired). USA, one of the strongest freaking country in the world believing a thug Bane on his whole stupid trigger with one of the citizen's monologue. No help for its greatest cities? Actually blocking it out? Just like that? Not even a small god damn negotiation? Might as well be pulling the triggers themselves.<br /><br />Moreover, Bane's speeches were unbearably annoying. And incomparable to Joker in any dimension. I mean he is reading out Gordon's story on Harvey Dent, in his slow supposedly \\"scary\\" voice, and the people of Gotham are supposed to believe him? Just because he is reading a piece of paper, well that proves its veracity.<br /><br />I understood why Ra's Al Ghul wanted to destroy Gotham. That made sense.  Ra's Al Ghul wanted to bring down all the filth in Gotham. Because in those times, Gotham was one of the dirties cities known to men. Ra's Al Ghul thought he would rid the world of evil by bringing down this god forsaken place. His daughter, on the other hand, just wanted to \\"avenge\\" him. In a time of peace, she wanted to bring chaos back, the same chaos Ra's Al Ghul fought against (in his own eyes). Nothing annoys me morethan a purposeless villain.<br /><br />How did Bruce travel from god knows where in the middle east to Gotham, and then actually snuck back in the city. If this was Batman begins, or The dark Knight, or the cartoons, I would answer the question myself. Because he is BATMAN ! But no, not for this one.<br /><br />I have to say the movie had some moments of its own, but overall a big let down.

B006OFN0BQ|5.0|It worked as if it came right from the store. Its a wonderful item to have. I will be buy more.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|An entertaining, fast read. Wouldn't have been as interesting if i didnt already have the character development from the show.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An amazing read! I couldn't put it down! A must read for anyone. Much better then the movie. Now on to the next book.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Having heard about the series from a friend, and his outrage at the casting of Cruise, I went to my local library site and picked it out.<br />Now fixed to 4 stars. Reach's abilities and attributes are beyond the reach of mere mortals. As pure fantasy, it was fun.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The subject says it all.  If you have &#34;real&#34; subwoofers, get ready for some rumbling as well.  Great price at Amazon as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great price and I loved the book! Made me very interested to read the next two, which I have already done!
B006O6FK2W|5.0|Must have for any batman fan!! My son absolutely loved this toy!! Was a huge score...lots lots of smiles. A toy that wont loose interest....will be played with for yrs to come
B007MDB6L0|5.0|The movie came brand new....it was so cheap too! My little nieces will be very HAPPY when they get it for Christmas! I will def look for more products from this seller!!
B002ZG976U|5.0|I know that this movie is cheezy but it is a really fun couple of hours of entertainment.  The numbers are great, the story is  no surprise but holds your interest and there some suprise stars in the cast.  If you like Cher and/or Christina Agulara, you'll probably really like this movie.  Christina looks more beautiful than I have ever seen her look.
B00653FC2W|3.0|Usually I hate the idea of anybody messing with MJ songs. A good 90% of his songs are classics and don't need to be messed with. But I was actually impressed when I heard this album. It's not perfect but the mixes here are actually refreshing.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|I bought this for my niece, she just loves to watch it on t.v. Now she can watch it anytime.

B005XI9456|5.0|My daughter's just love JB, so of course I had to buy his holiday album! Great songs, with a JB twist!
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|One of the absolute best works in all of modern music! 'Great Gig in the Sky' and 'Time' are at the acme of a whole album of highlights.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I love Susan Boyle. I loved this album. The song choices are wonderful and her voice soars as always. I liked, but did not love her other albums. I am afraid that she will never top that live tv performance of &#34;I Dreamed a Dream,&#34; so everything else is less remarkable. She sings most everything well here, but she's majestic on &#34;The Winner Takes it All.&#34;
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|'Comfortably Numb' is my favorite Floyd song... and second favorite song overall regardless of performer. For me, the album is great through 'Run Like Hell,' but drops off and loses my interest for the remainder of the lp.
B000HC2LI0|3.0|I suspect most people thinking about purchasing this set are already aware of the brilliance that is The West Wing so I won't ramble on about that.<br />My issue is with the packaging. The cardboard that holds the discs makes it very easy for them to scratch. My set also had several problem dvds in season 7. By problem I mean the first 3 dvds contained the same episodes so that i am missing several episodes. Anyone who loves  this series knows how tragic that is!!!
B004I506G6|5.0|I have nothing but good memories of the first couple of seasons of this show. Now seeing them again as an adult, my appreciation has only increased. Well worth the sale price.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Having grown up in the south, I could identify with a lot of the somewhat over the top actions of the characters.  Unless you have been a part of the &#34;culture&#34; of the 50's and 60's in the south you might be left asking yourself what these people were all about.  Well, my dears, in many cases the movie was right on about the attitudes and customs of the day.  Hillariously funny to someone who lived it.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|If you like finding the same objects over and over in a different scene then this is perfect. The story in between is the only difference. I worked up to chapter 8 and was told to find many objects over and over. Once in a while I got a spot the differences or rotate the tiles puzzle. Not hard. Mindless entertainment to me.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Love Harrison Ford in anything, but, this was an entertaining as well as fast paced movie.  It kept you on the edge with the action and trying to decipher all the actions and the outcome.
B007WULJ5G|5.0|Just seen the uncut Version.<br />It begins like a porn flick (During the first 30 min I was often tempted to switch it off, but I held on.), but then it takes off. Mix porn with horror, add some David Lynch, some Sion Sono, some Gaspar Noe, and serve it cold, and you have \\"A Serbian Film\\". Compared to mainstream productions of these days, it comes as a low budget film, but that's part of its charme. An Arthouse film. The acting is brilliant! When it begins, the actors are like in porn flicks - bored, doing their job. As the intensity grows, the acting becomes better and better.<br /><br />When remembering the recent history of Serbia, this film made me shudder: It is working on the collective trauma of a whole nation. Those scenes in the prison cells - they really had that!
0547848412|4.0|Combining adventure and excitement with a profound connection to divinity, Pi Patel's journey is riveting. The reader finds that the author's style of writing as though he is interviewing the real Pi Patel captivates the imagination and makes it easy to see everything as it were going on in front of you. As if this was not enough, Martel highlights the themes of self discovery, survival of the fittest, and unlikely friendship. The sea is not a forgiving place, and this novel is a piercing reminder of the earth's unimaginable power. However, it still gives it's readers the hope for good to always come out of bad and a friendly reminder that there is always a little mystery in this world. From cover to cover, I could not put this book down, and I believe everyone from animal lovers to die-hard adventurists would find themselves in the same predicament.
0767824571|5.0|If you appreciate British humor you will love this movie.  My husband laughed through the entire movie.  Me, not so much but there were 3-4 really funny parts.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD.  It is my go-to chill out music right now.  I play it all the time!
B009K45Y62|4.0|I brought my copy from Asda in the UK and it seems that are region B version has a ridiculous DTS MA 5.1 soundtrack.  The bass is way to high and the volume is to loud to a point where it distorts no matter how much you turn it down, I had to turn my subwoofer down by a massive 6 dB and the same with the EQ for all the surround and front speakers.  I really like this film but refuse to watch it more than once as the soundtrack is just to annoying. Does the region A version sound the same or has it been mastered properly?  I do have a multi-zone bluray player and would love to watch this film with the DTS audio sounding correct can some one let me know if the U.S version has a correct DTS 5.1 soundtrack as our region b version is pants!!!!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|It's good.  What can I say... dark and dark and dark... but oh so good.  The acting great and it ties things up well.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|We tried another Toslink to RCA decoder first, but got a lot of hissing. This unit works perfectly with our LG 42LM6200, just have to be sure to set the TV audio output to PCM.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Great little game.  It does get a bit repetitive, but it is definitely a great time killer.  Would recommend for anyone.
B000I52LUO|5.0|NO SPOILER:  I was resistant to a film I felt had been 'over-hyped.'  Having waited until December 16, 2012 to see THE MACHINIST, I am thankful to have given it a chance.<br /><br />It all begins close to the end, it's hard to recognize the Christian Bale of THE DARK KNIGHT fame, which is only PART of the brilliance of his performance in MACHINIST.<br /><br />The thoughtful writing and the layered symbolism give the film emotional and intellectual dimension.  Smart choices were made that allow viewers to perceive that they are on a cinematic treasure hunt, and should be looking for and interpreting clues; at the same time, there is a sense that the story is unfolding just enough a head of any Plot Epiphanies to preserve the moments of shock that eventually build to a peak of revelation.<br /><br />Though not biblical, the great pacing and black and white morality of the tale provide an unpolluted sense of catharsis, which mirrors the resolution of the central conflict.<br /><br />BTW, Jeniffer Jason Leigh's gritty, unadorned brilliance glows.   MORE THAN WORTH WATCHING....
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|As all Brown books, keeps you on the edge the whole time. Great twists and surprises all the way until the end.
B009FB3WQ4|3.0|I was disappointed with the people/singers that were chosen to honor her, after all it's Barbra Streisand the best there is!!!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I love the Jodi Picoult books.  This was very good.  Sad ending.<br /><br />I will share with my Kindle Fire sharing friends/sister.
B0059XTU1S|5.0|I just saw &#34;Hobbit&#34; and I was VERY impressed! Below you will find the reasons why I liked this film so much, with some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />1. A successful combination of great fidelity to Tolkien's vision with some skilful alterations. In second part of LOTR (&#34;Two Towers&#34;) Peter Jackson allowed himself some very considerable liberties with the characters of king Theoden of Rohan and captain Faramir of Gondor, and as a consequence he harmed this one part of his great trilogy. He clearly learned his lesson and in this film, even if there are some differences between the scenario and the original book, those modification were done with a great skill, good taste and in deep respect with the general vision contained in Tolkien's books in general.<br /><br />Amongst those successful modifications are a greater development of the story of Smaug's coming to Erebor, of dwarves wanderings and their wars with Orcs from Moria (those last elements are taken from original annexes to &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;) and a larger inclusion of scary and extremely creepy Dol Guldur fortress (which is only briefly mentioned in the book). There is also a longer and more dramatic chapter devoted to Great Goblin's caves, a brief but impressive look at stone giants (creatures only suggested in Tolkien's lore) and last but not least, some real screen time devoted to Radagast the Brown, an extremely odd but very, very attaching character. Radagast also shows in this film that he is definitely a force to be reckoned with and not just a sidekick - although, as Saruman venomously suggests it, he also appears to be all the time &#34;tripping on 'shrooms&#34;...)))<br /><br />There is also more place devoted to the White Council (with Saruman, Galadriel, Elrond and Gandalf present and Radagast and Cirdan absent) and those passages come in fact from the annexes to LOTR rather than from &#34;Hobbit&#34; itself. Finally, even if many good jokes are included, the general tone of this film is more serious than in the book, with the dwarves being a little less comically represented and their leader, prince Thorin Oakshield, being a much more impressive character, conserving a very great dignity and majesty even when being stuffed in a troll's bag...)))<br /><br />Finally, the leader of Moria Orcs at the time of dwarves expedition is still Azog the Defiler rather than his son Bolg - but I forgive willingly Peter Jackson this change, as Azog is a really IMPRESSIVE creature! On another hand, and this is one of the very few things I found a little objectionnable, Orcs seem to not fear sunlight in this film (Goblins of Misty Mountains on another hand still fear the light of the day) - but after all it is a rather minor thing.<br /><br />As you can see Peter Jackson changed the story for the needs of his &#34;Hobbit&#34; trilogy, but he did it with the greatest care and by showing this time the greatest respect to the general spirit of Tolkien's works.<br /><br />2. A great mastery of the visual aspect of the film. The images of Middle Earth are breath-taking, the creatures (good and evil) are excellent and the costumes and weaponry simply perfect.<br /><br />3. Gollum; All the chapter about Bilbo's meeting with Gollum is pure perfection and in this film we finally can realise how REALLY DANGEROUS this creature is!<br /><br />4. Tom Troll, William Troll and Bert Troll. Hilarious and scary in the same time, their moment in the film is simply a treasure.<br /><br />5. Goblins of the Misty Mountains. In this film we have a real insight into goblin's government (tyranny), administration (anarchy), strategy (mostly blunt force trauma) and communications, although the little pearl about this last point, you will have to discover by yourself...)))<br /><br />6. Dwarves/elves mutual cultural shock - one of the best scenes of the film...)))<br /><br />7. Music. It mostly uses the same themes than in LOTR (ex. Shire theme, Rivendell theme, Ring theme, Company theme, etc.) which gives a familiar feeling of continuity, with just enough new elements to underline the fact that we are in a different chapter of Tolkien's tales.<br /><br />8. Action scenes - they are many and of excellent quality, thanks to some modifications of the story by Peter Jackson (see above). They help also to set a rather fast rhythm of events, once the initial Shire chapter is concluded. If you think that to make a trilogy out of &#34;The Hobbit&#34; Peter Jackson had to drag things and slow the events, well, think again... This is a reasonably long film but I didn't feel the time pass.<br /><br />9. Actors. Unlike in LOTR II &#34;Two Towers&#34; (when he seriously blundered by casting Miranda Otto as Eowyn), in this film Peter Jackson didn't commit any mistakes in the choice of actors. Martin Freeman is more than perfect in his interpretation of Bilbo - for me, after two minutes, he WAS Bilbo - all right, OK, maybe they just should have given him ten pounds more around the waist in the first part of the trilogy, but this is just a detail. Ian McKellen is of course perfect as Gandalf. Richard Armitage as Thorin is THE revelation of this film. Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee are of course brilliant - and Cate Blanchett swept me of my feet in this film (something that didn't happen in the LOTR...).<br /><br />The one objection I could have is that I didn't quite picture Balin, the friendliest of dwarves, as being that old - but this is a very minor detail.<br /><br />10. Clever little details of the scenario. Peter Jackson put in the scenario some little but significant details which explain better some important questions, like why did Gandalf wanted SO MUCH to help Thorin Oakenshield in his quest and why exactly did he choose precisely Bilbo Baggins as the &#34;burglar&#34; for the Company. Those little details didn't figure in the book, but they are VERY faithful to the spirit of Tolkien's story - and it is a very precious thing...<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Since attacking the LOTR Peter Jackson learned a lot in last 10 years and he put all this experience to good use in &#34;The Hobbit&#34; - and the result is immediately visible on the screen. This film is on the same very high level of quality as LOTR I and III and BETTER than LOTR II. In some aspects he even did a better job than in LOTR, because here he had to manage a Company larger than the Fellowship of the Ring (15 characters instead of 9) - and he succeeded very, very well indeed. I loved this film and I cannot wait to see &#34;The desolation of Smaug&#34;.ny theme, etc.) which gives a familiar feeling of continuity, with just enough new elements to underline the fact that we are in a different chapter of Tolkien's tales.<br /><br />8. Action scenes - they are many and of excellent quality, thanks to some modifications of the story by Peter Jackson (see above). They help also to set a rather fast rhythm of events, once the initial Shire chapter is concluded. If you think that to make a trilogy out of &#34;The Hobbit&#34; Peter Jackson had to drag things and slow the events, well, think again...

Ian McKellen is of course perfect as Gandalf. Richard Armitage as Thorin is THE revelation of this film. Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee are of course brilliant - and Cate Blanchett swept me of my feet in this film (something that didn't happen in the LOTR...).<br /><br />The one objection I could have is that I didn't quite picture Balin, the friendliest of dwarves, as being that old - but this is a very minor detail.<br /><br />10. Clever little details of the scenario. Peter Jackson put in the scenario some little but significant details which explain better some important questions, like why did Gandalf wanted SO MUCH to help Thorin Oakenshield in his quest and why exactly did he choose precisely Bilbo Baggins as the &#34;burglar&#34; for the Company. Those little details didn't figure in the book, but they are VERY faithful to the spirit of Tolkien's story - and it is a very precious thing...<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Since attacking the LOTR Peter Jackson learned a lot in last 10 years and he put all this experience to good use in &#34;The Hobbit&#34; - and the result is immediately visible on the screen. This film is on the same very high level of quality as LOTR I and III and BETTER than LOTR II. In some aspects he even did a better job than in LOTR, because here he had to manage a Company larger than the Fellowship of the Ring (15 characters instead of 9) - and he succeeded very, very well indeed. I loved this film and I cannot wait to see &#34;The desolation of Smaug&#34;.

0767836324|5.0|I always loved this as a child - but never knew why even Disney's Captain Hook never really met up to my standards (I saw 'Hook' before I saw Disney's 'Peter Pan.') It was all because one: Dustin Hoffman is perhaps one of the greatest actors ever and he was a SUPERB Hook, and two: This movie has so much depth to it, despite what others might think - it is so interwoven with the classic Peter Pan and this adult version - with Maggie Smith as Wendy - just perfect.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander's astounding account of the afterlife resonates with multiple world faiths and takes us one step closer to the 2012 spiritual mind shift in human understanding of life after death. His story shines truth and awareness on Om or God, love and compassion that permeate human existance and everything that is alive in the universe. Although our human understanding is limited, or veiled, the depth to his story enables us to see further into an NDE experience than ever before and takes those of us who can accept his truth to a higher level of conscious understanding.

0345529057|5.0|Martin's been touted as the American Tolkien. Everyone knows &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; is on TV/HBO now. The incredible thing is that for all the rich development they do on the television series, it's thousands of times more depth in the books themselves. I have actually had the pleasure to re-read these books 2-3x (no easy feat, given they're each about 1,000 pages), and find that each time I do, I find more detail that I missed in the first reading.<br /><br />People will often refer to the first book as the very best, and it indeed sets the scene so wonderfully, it's hard to argue. But the subsequent books in the series are just as powerful in their own way. And, without giving too many spoilers away, there is a very real sense of &#34;anything goes&#34; in the series to keep people on their toes.<br /><br />I'm definitely a fan now and am anxiously awaiting new books in the series. If you're a fantasy fan and/or big on rich, detailed worlds and characters, this is a must read. How Martin brings so many varied characters to life is simply amazing and cannot be undersold.

B0025KW29U|5.0|Ok, NPH (Neil Patrick Harris) reinvigorated his career after Doogie Howser, by going crazy crude on Harold and Kumar. It's supposedly what brought him back into the fold for shows like How I Met Your Mother.<br /><br />Dr. Horrible was created during the Writer's Guild of America strike back in '07-08. To me, it shows how versatile NPH is with comedy. He is just so fluidly capable of making us laugh, while bringing empathy for his character. The cast also includes Felicia Day (a regular webisoder), who also was recently in a Supernatural episode as the quirky, hacker lesbian. Not really relevant, but her &#34;quirkiness&#34; also comes out in her character here and makes her &#34;the girl next door&#34; in this program.<br /><br />We also can't leave out Nathan Fillion (of Firefly and Castle fame). Downright hilarious as the &#34;anti-hero&#34; from the get-go. Always charming, and even more so when being pompous, he is a perfect foil for Dr. Horrible (NPH).<br /><br />The sing-along blog will definitely make you want to burst out into song on your own along with the gang. Definitely a favorite of mine, demonstrated by my one-time Halloween costume as Captain Hammer (no one got it, because not enough people watched this awesome show). I can't wait until they make the sequel!

B003VANOFY|4.0|The first one I got was defective.  It would lose connection constantly, and at first I thought it was just the apartment I was in (many wifi connections in the area).  After some checking around I decided to ask for a replacement as some people noticed hardware issues.  It's a good thing I did because the new one works just fine.  I think it was the headset itself in my first set that was defective, as I tried it out after syncing with my new USB dongle and it had connection issues.  The first one works fine.<br /><br />So if you get a working one it's pretty nice.  The software should be updated ASAP as the default software is old and buggy.  Bass response could be better as well, but I got this on sale for $70 so I'm happy.

It was not a text that made you want to keep reading, rather one that reminded me of a text book, containing material that I wanted to know. But little pleasure in the actual process of reading it.That does not mean the content was flawed or uninteresting, just a presentation that could have been much better with some editing .

0307959856|4.0|This is a Review of the Book by Carrie Wasinger from Empirical Magazine: [...]  The literary body is suffering from Jane Austen reflux. Pride and Prejudice just keeps coming back to us, in ever more caustic  forms. Journey to your local Barnes and Noble, and you will find yourself in the land of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and Mr. Darcy's Bite having passed through the forgettable villages of A Wife for Mr. Darcy and Mr. Darcy's Undoing along the way.    What accounts for this contemporary fascination with a narrative that's nearly two hundred years old? The ladies of the nation's book clubs may answer as one, like a Greek chorus: \\"The epic romance speaks to the very marrow of the modern woman! Darcy is our ideal husband, a hero unknown among modern men!\\" Well ladies, first, I suggest you cut back on the chardonnay. Then, I ask: have you read Austen? Because epic, she is not. Romantic? Not even.    Austen's novels are finely-wrought, sophisticated acts of rhetorical prowess that peek into the complexities of a social moment that we post-moderns cannot hope to know because it no longer exists. To put it simply, hers was a society built, very carefully, on character. To read Austen for the ebb and swell of romance is to mistake Simon and Garfunkle for Green Day.    As a much-needed antidote to Austen reflux, acclaimed mystery novelist P.D. James brings us Death Comes to Pemberley, the latest in the string of novels to fantasize about the post-nuptial events of Pride and Prejudice. Kicking the salivary glands of both Austen and James devotees into high gear, the novel attempts to marry two of the more antithetical impulses of fiction: the gritty, darkened world of criminal misdeeds and the carefully ordered rhetorical discretion of Georgian England. Death Comes to Pemberley sets out to remind us that the world of Pride and Prejudice (zombies notwithstanding) values reason and prudence above all else. All the beloved characters from the original are brought back toteach us that we should value reason and prudence, too.    The novel opens a handful of years after the events of Pride and Prejudice. On the eve of the annual Pemberley ball, a coach madly races through the estate's woodland to deposit the estranged Lydia Wickham on the doorstep of Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam Darcy, her sister and brother-in-law, where she hysterically announces that her husband is dead. Darcy and his male guests tromp off into the night to investigate, only to discover Wickham, fully alive, leaning over the corpse of the Wickhams' close friend, Captain Denny. The only thing more distasteful to Darcy than having the Wickhams on his hands again is the possibility that Wickham may be convicted of murder, which would entail scandal on all present and future generations of Darcys. To his credit, however, Darcy cannot bring himself to believe in Wickham's guilt and sets out to ensure that justice be done.    Comes to Pemberley can't help but admire the adroitness with which James has adopted Austen's prose style. James's sentences, like Austen's, unwind stealthily, with the pacing and phrasing that promise a satisfying bite of sarcasm at the end. But mere imitation is not James's intent. In contemporary mysteries, forensic science often takes point in solving the crime. Death Comes to Pemberley takes place in a time before blood-typing and ballistics. The trial of Wickham, which occupies the last third of the novel, must therefore turn on evidence of character, not science.    What is said about a person, what a person says about themselves, what is deliberately not said--these all conspire to create character, good or bad. The novelist's job of drawing character becomes as important for this text as the magistrate's job of ascertaining guilt or innocence. Austen presaged later novelists by gifting her primary characters complex, evolving psychologies.    James does justice to the rakish George Wickham, who is neither more nor less dissolute than when welast met him. But elsewhere, there are problems. Austen's Elizabeth Bennett, who could cut as deeply as a Ginzu knife with a well-placed remark and make us love her even more, has been replaced by James's dowdy Elizabeth Darcy, who maintains a zombie-like attachment to both prudence and Pemberley. Indeed, the opening scene of the novel, in which Colonel Fitzwilliam, Darcy's cousin, acknowledges to Elizabeth his aspiration to Georgiana Darcy's hand, is all about Mrs. Darcy biting her tongue. (The ladies' book club Greek chorus shouts \\"Nooooo!\\" into the unresponsive heavens.)    Darcy is more tolerable. Here James improves on the original. Permitting readers inside Darcy's proud head in a way that Austen never contrived, James encourages us to understand gentility as it was likely experienced at the time: a complex system of patronage in which benefactors (like Darcy) and dependents (like Wickham) were symbiotically linked. In this way, James returns us to an unfamiliar era when democracy was largely untried and older political forms ordered all ranks of society--forms which depended for their success not on popular vote, but on the character of the individuals invested with power.    To that end, James has created a few new characters. The first is the second contender for Georgiana's hand, the young lawyer Henry Alveston, a thoroughly modern type who interprets for us the intricacies of early 19th-century British law. The second, Sir Selwyn Hardcastle, the magistrate to whom Darcy turns over the execution of local justice, is by far James's best addition to Austen's world. We meet him ensconced in his smoking room reading a tome, not unwillingly disturbed from his quiet, intellectual evening by this local tragedy. To Darcy's eyes he represents \\"the embodiment of the law.\\" As Sir Selwyn's is the only dialogue to approach Austen's playful banter it comes as a welcome relief, yet his character is not much developed beyond this point. Colonel Fitzwilliam on the other hand, an original of Austen's, receives so much development from James that he might as well be brand new.    In a move no doubt intended to spare her audience, James has largely exiled Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Collins, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh to the margins. Even Lydia gets less airtime than one would expect, considering her husband is on trial for murder. With them has also gone much of the comic intensity of Austen's universe, leaving no buoyant idiocy to offset the morbidity of the murder mystery and no disgraceful thoughtlessness to relieve the morality of the respectable characters. In Austen's world, Lydia's promiscuousness and Lady Catherine de Burgh's narrow-mindedness make Jane's chastity and Bingley's tolerance enviable qualities. In Death Comes to Pemberley, Jane comes off as perfectly vanilla and Bingley as an undiscerning dunderhead who exists simply so that Darcy can tell him to look after the women.    Less forgivable is the novel's almost complete abandonment of those remarkable scenes of formal and informal social gatherings--the dinners, balls, musical evenings, and the like--that gave Austen a chance to pit her characters against each other and see what emerged. In Austen, the best and worst of human nature are revealed in conversation. James seems shy of such moments, preferring to let readers enter the thoughts of individual characters or give us only brief, unsatisfactory, often redundant dialogue. As a result, the plot slows, but doesn't thicken. If Austen's characterization is a landscape, full of peaks and valleys, James's is a vast flatland, monotonous and rather dull.    But perhaps this is too harsh criticism; following in Austen's footsteps is no easy matter, and after all, the novel of manners is not James's milieu. Having penned the Adam Dalgliesh series for 50 years now, James is the uncontested queen of contemporary British mystery fiction, and setting a murder mystery in the world of Pride and Prejudice is a true stroke of genius.    The mystery genre emerged in the 1840s, only thirty years after Austen's major work, and in many ways, Austen flirted with its elements. Pride and Prejudice and Emma both turn on secrets that come to light unexpectedly, and Northanger Abbey, a sendup of the 18th-century gothic novel, is all about finding secrets where there are none. Moreover, it makes sense to set a mystery in Austen's universe precisely because Austen drew the morality of that universe so carefully. Detective fiction--particularly of the kind at which James excels--endures because it both disrupts and reassures: if the criminal is a figure for corruption, the detective is a figure for the satisfying execution of justice.    Sadly, Death Comes to Pemberley steals away that satisfaction. Although Darcy shows early promise as a possible amateur sleuth, no proper detective figure ever emerges from the story. The plot is never twisty enough and the characters never corrupt enough to really disorder the novel's moral universe. The revelation, in true Austenian fashion, comes by way of a letter that has the disappointing effect of exonerating just about everybody. Consequently, the resolution feels as tepid as the scandal, and the narrative positively limps to a close.    There are bright moments in the novel. Although as a mystery Death Comes to Pemberley may disappoint, as an escape from the absurdity of Austen reflux, it is a welcome addition to bookstore shelves. What the novel really offers, however, is a nostalgic retrospective of Britain on the threshold of industrialization. As such it reminds us--even through its failings-- that good character is everything.
0062124293|5.0|The book was brand new. It was shipped and delivered to me within days of ordering it. And the actual book is really good and definitely a recommended read. I thought Moran was funny, whimsical, and inspiring. Though, I didn't always agree with her point of views and sometimes felt like she was being very one sided and unwilling to acknowledge such one sidedness, I think it's a book worth reading, as it provides a decent amount of insight into the mind of a woman growing into a woman.
