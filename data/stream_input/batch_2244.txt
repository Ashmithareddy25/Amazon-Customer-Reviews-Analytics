B006LSZECO|3.0|Gillian Flynn has spine together a story that makes you want to keep reading. The back and forth action between the main characters puzzles together a story at an interesting pace. Predictable, but will have you questioning your first guess at what happens next.

B002TZ3DYY|4.0|As I was writing my novel [[ASIN:B007IV56FI Thicker Than Water: a Dermot O'Hara Mystery (The Dermot O'Hara Mysteries)]] I was very much aware of the characters who populate the pages of Alexander McCall Smith's novels and why they have such a deep appeal for us. He has the knack of creating real individuals who are apparently easy to understand, yet serious and thoughtful at the same time. The simple humanity of Mma Ramotswe and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni offers welcome relief in our complex and cynical world. They fulfil the role of wise elders; though who would dare use the word `elder' in front of the formidable Mma Ramotswe? In `the Tears of the Giraffe' Mr J.L.B. Matekoni is now fully under the spell of Mma Ramotswe and engaged to her. The story begins with the minutiae of their gentle Botswana lives but the outside world intrudes when an American woman seeks Mma Ramotswe's help to find a missing son, whom she presumes dead while at the same time Mr J.L.B. Matekoni adopts two children. McCall Smith's love of Africa and Botswana in particular, shines through his writing as he blends these themes of vibrant life and tragic loss, convincing in both stories.<br />Contrasting the simplicity of African life with western values might be contrived or dogmatic if not handled with skill but here that comparison is an integral part of the story. The sentence which sums up McCall Smith's underlying philosophy is, `This is what Africa could say to the world: it could remind it what it is to be human.' A valuable lesson from an engaging and charming story by an accomplished writer. Highly recommended!
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Baldacci has a talent for developing the characters in his books, and his use of dialogue is very well done.  I have read almost all of Baldacci's books and enjoy the great story lines and variety of subjects.
B00A7OIXW6|3.0|Finding NEMO, CARS, Monster Inc. These are a few of Pixar/Disney releases that are better. IMHO. I may be partially at fault for this rating though. I have read many reviews of this movie and several critics praised this as one of the best ever. So of course I was expecting this amazing movie towering over other Pixar releases. SIGH. The story is uncomplicated to a point that the whole movie could have been done as a half hour cartoon with commercials. None of the characters grab you as truly memorable. The previews give the impression that Ralph goes on some epic journey and he only really visits 2 other games (if you don't count the bar), and a major portion of the movie is in a single game. While other Pixar movies seem to be designed for the young and old alike to enjoy, Wreck-it Ralph is just a kids movie. The bug war part that is directed towards the older crowd is so minimum in movie time, there's almost a &#34;stick this in for the teens&#34; feel to it. Its decent animation and very colorful but is below par overall for what I have come to expect from Pixar. 3 stars is as far as I'll go on this one.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Was amazed by this Bond. Not the movie you would ever expect to see. Sets up the perfect continuation of the series.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|As with all the other Harry Potter books and movies, this one was very well done. Having read all the books, we wanted to watch all the movies too. These movies follow the books very well and the cinematography is wonderful. Some of the scenes do get violent, but it is part of the story and there is no unnecessary extras. Highly recommend the entire series.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|The star power of Hopkins and Mirren drew me to this movie, while at the same time, I was hoping to gain some insights into the art of filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock.  I was not disappointed on either count.  The movie kept my attention throughout and provided me with new insights into the lives of Hitchcock and Alma Reville.  The later insights were an unexpected bonus and pleasure.  I highly recommend this movie!

B0062YADWI|5.0|I bought this to replace a very worn-out carabiner that connects my wallet chain to my belt loop.  The bottle opener is really handy, I don't have to pull out my Surge anymore.  In my humble opinion, Leatherman should have made the hex driver a 5/16\\"-8MM instead, it would be considerably more useful!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I enjoyed this app and it was really helpful because I have a hard time going to sleep so this really helps calm me down and makes me drowsy I suggest you get it if you have a hard time sleeping.
0767802624|4.0|I'm not a great fan of science fiction with gory themes, but this one is funny. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith don't seem like they would be good characters at first. They come together with corny comedy that keeps you laughing all the way through. And by the end of the movie you can really care about them. We watch this movie when we want a relaxing, no-brainer evening at home. Good, clean entertainment.
B0094K1JPC|5.0|The movie is a great light hearted comedy.  There are similarities to Broadcast News. Harrison Ford does a great grumpy old man. Miss his Hans Solo smile.

B003K16PAU|4.0|What a surprise to me to read a book that has such different tone than what I had considered \\"Orwellian\\".  \\"Down and Out in Paris and London\\" whether fiction and non-fiction seems to follow an autobiographical narrative of Orwell's life in the late 1920's and early 1930's.<br /><br />While I liked the pace and found myself drawn in and enjoying this narrative a reader should know that there is no plot of note and the enjoyment rests on one's interest in Orwell's description of the life of the poor, struggling or completely indigent in Paris and London at that time. I found it worthwhile. In Paris the narrator is working in the lowest ranks of restaurants (when he is working), le plongeur which loosely translates to \\"dishwasher and whatever else we tell you to do\\". Upon returning to London he follows along with Tramps that would most resemble the American Hobos.<br /><br />In both cities the characters become people. He gives them substance, vice, virtue and humanness without over writing or drifting away from his goal of describing life broadly.<br /><br />I found Paris a bit more interesting. His group of associates and friends were better sketched and more diverse and the vignettes of life could be well imagined. The restaurant scenes are full of chaos, conflict and explanations on the shortcuts taken by all those preparing our food. It's not pretty. It's \\"Down and Out Kitchen Confidential\\". Even from the vantage point of 80 years later I'd still not recommend reading this book ahead of going to a fine French restaurant and I'll be thinking about bed bugs in hotels forever.<br /><br />His return to London takes us on tour of the Spikes which were the homeless shelters of their time. You can imagine an unattractive world of bad food (but good tea), gross communal bathroom, dehumanizing treatment and deeply seeded resentment on all sides. His tone struck me as \\"Lonely Planet for the REALLY lonely\\".<br /><br />The story is important for its portrayal and sympathy for those in need. Orwell is rich in logical explanations for the plight of these men (99% men) but the indignities that they suffer and much that they bring on themselves. He was in his 20's when he wrote this. It's impressive to have his depth of experience, perspective and articulation of ideas at such an age and written \\"live time\\" without the benefit of reflection.those in need.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|I believed this book to be almost sacred; mostly in due part, the effort put forth of these unsubsidized earrings to share with our Government and the rings online marking all this down. I believed that the new LG's and Advertising Co Ltd has been working awesome deals with our Government and its allies to be almost sacred not to mention the fact that they have been having some people who want to share some awesome deals with our own internet marketing services.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I personally don't usually care for books about High School love but this book kept my interest. It started off a little slow for me but it really picked and got much better. Their are some good twists in the story an I loved the ending. All in all I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it even for people like me who don't usually care for high school books. This one is a very sweet love story that I think anyone would really enjoy.

B008220DIC|1.0|Two movies about re-incarnation in 2012...<br /><br />One is a riveting masterpiece with magnificent acting, directing, stories, scripts, music, visual effects, and cinematography called CLOUD ATLAS.<br /><br />The other a strange little story called THE MASTER, with uneven directing, dull script, weak disjointed story, weird music, and a lead actor who often mumbles unintelligibly. To show the weak directing and editing: In one scene something exciting is happening, and just when it starts to get really interesting, just when you start to think it may be related to a recent event, they cut away from it, and never mention it again! You will never know if the two events are connected, or what happened!!  Uh!  What a horrible movie!<br /><br />I see why critics and The Academy loved THE MASTER.  It's an edgy, uncomfortable, strangely directed expos&eacute; on the founder of one of the biggest cults in the world.  But in THE MASTER they show you the beginnings of one man's experiments on clearing emotional struggles by using time travel of the soul instead of hypnotherapy, which sounds like a great idea, but he talks about going back Billions of years.  Plus he makes irrational changes to the process early on.  And in this expos&eacute;, they don't show you much about the organization or really \\"expose\\" anything important or interesting.  We've all probably heard about the little bit they do show at some point in our lives, so not only is it not an enjoyable movie, it's a complete waste of time.<br /><br />While in CLOUD ATLAS we are shown - in a very enlightening, most fascinating, and brutally honest way - the consequences of the actions of human beings through the centuries, and what happens to people in future lives, when they had been kind to people, and when they had been cruel.<br /><br />So which is better?  I say the one that was more enjoyable, and vastly more important, CLOUD ATLAS.<br /><br />Which movie was nominated for an Oscar? THE MASTER received three Acting Nominations, while CLOUD ATLAS was not nominated for any Oscars at all.  That's typical.  But if you would like to see two great movies about re-incarnation in the next few months... I'd say buy or rent: ON A CLEAR DAY YOU CAN SEE FOREVER and then CLOUD ATLAS.<br /><br />And if you are in the mood for a strange little, dull story about the beginnings of a bizarre cult that's not even a good expos&eacute;, then see THE MASTER, by all means.  But, WARNING:  THE MASTER HAS LOTS OF VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SCENES WITH TOTALLY NAKED WOMEN!!<br /><br />Thank You.nations, while CLOUD ATLAS was not nominated for any Oscars at all.  That's typical.

B009DJB8I2|5.0|So first when i got the box, it shows some nice artwork on the front, and a track listing on the back.<br />Then when i opened it i was greeted by 4 personality cores, all CD's are printed with the eyes of Wheatley, Rick, Space Core and the Fact Core.<br />The first three CD's contain the 3 volumes of the 'songs to test by' album, with all the sounds from Portal2.<br />The last CD contains all the soundtracks of portal1.  In the box you can also find a small comic about the turret lullaby and codes for DOTA and TF2.<br />The music in this album is soothing and is great for solving problems/schoolwork, most tracks are ambient and dont contain any distracting lyrics. (except for the last one)<br /><br />This album is not only nice to play in a CD player but also great for having on display as it's very pretty.<br />Music in this album can be both found on the portal2 website, the Orangebox digital soundtrack bundled with Audiosurf.<br />And in it's entirity on Spotify. Though in spite of this wide availability i do really recommend to purchase this as it brings a bit of the virtual portal2 into the real world ;)
B009JBZH54|1.0|Inside the box, disc of the movie &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; was missing. Instead, two copies of the movie &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; have been sent. Now, if i had to buy the latest edition from outside, it will cost me the same as buying it individually. This is very serious and sick. I need to get a response to this.

B001KWTBVQ|4.0|Great adaptation of Cinderella.  Great cast.  I love that they bring in DaVinci too.  One I can watch over again.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This was one of those meaty films with solid plot, interesting characters, and action to boot!  Who would think a 5 mph car ride could be such a nail biter?  Ben Affleck hardly moves a muscle, and yet conveys a great deal.  He's really grown as an actor.  A really good film.
0062238868|5.0|This is a great book.  A real, intimate look into the life of a true American Hero.  Fascinating.  I'm not a heavy reader by any means and found this very hard to put down.  God bless his family.  On behalf of a grateful American citizen, thank you for your service, Chris.  You will certainly be missed by many.
0446547573|3.0|I bought the book because I loved the movie and I wanted to explore some of the elements in more detail.  But I was disappointed by the book.  Frankly, I think the movie was much better crafted . . . and I rarely think that.<br /><br />Alex Wheatley is a widower in the small town of Southport, North Carolina, struggling to raise his two young children alone following the death of his wife a couple of years earlier.  Katie is the mysterious beauty who has recently moved to town, taken up a job waitressing, and clearly prefers to keep to herself.  These two gradually fall for each other and Alex (who used to be an investigator for the Army's Criminal Investigative Division) gradually pieces together the secrets of Katie's past.<br /><br />I like that these two seemed to fall in love gradually and over a reasonable amount of time.  And that they didn't rush into the bedroom together.  And I'm pleased that their feelings for each other did seem to germinate from some truly meaningful connections like her easy way with his kids and a shared appreciation for Dickens.  I just wished it had run a little deeper somehow.<br /><br />In many ways, this book accurately depicted (minor spoiler alert) domestic violence . . . and I admire the book's ability to shed some light on that difficult dynamic.<br /><br />But, overall, I found the book to drag somewhat.  And I found a lot of faults with the character of Katie's neighbor, Jo, which was much better done in the movie.  Also, and this is a minor complaint, but it says that Alex retired from the Army after ten years of service . . . and that is inconsistent with how military retirements work.  I know it may seem like a small point, but the details do count.<br /><br />I wanted to love this book as much as I enjoyed the movie, but it just fell somewhat flat.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to understand, great fun to play and really improves your game, like the help feature and the winning hand option.
B004NELBPC|4.0|I like its variety and more honest approach to the current news. It touches a wide spectrum of interests and gives insight into each issue be it in entertainment, business, politics or finance that is not slanted by ideologue thought.
B001NN4162|5.0|My 2-yr old daughter has been in love with this movie since her first viewing.  She will ask for &#34;Boo&#34; and &#34;Sully&#34; when she wants to watch it, which is at least once every day.  She's getting where she knows sounds and words at specific parts of the movie, and loves to try and imitate them.<br /><br />It was definitely worth the purchase for me and my family - it keeps us all entertained.  And, if I need to do something in the house - I know that she's safe watching the movie because the content is appropriate for her!
B005KAH7QU|5.0|I Thought the movie was great ! Lots of action and intrigue. Its an amazing movie , one where you would not expect a young innocent looking girl to be an asassin. I had mixed emotions about exploiting young children to kill. I think it could send negative complex ideas to young people who would think they could do what the fictional hanna was capable of .
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I really enjoyed this!  Anyone who has spent a bit of time in an arcade will appreciate how the movie portrays getting inside the arcade world.  Great voice talent!  Good fun for all.
B000GBEWHA|3.0|The case is very flimsy, and had cracked all along the bottom when I received it in the mail.  The DVD was not ruined, but it could have been if one of the plastic pieces that broke off scratched it up.
034580404X|5.0|This is not a classically well written novel ... it is a book much like 'Peyton Place' was it its day. Steamy, kinky, a look into the world of bondage and submission that will feed your fantasies without you actually participating in the reality.<br />What I liked most was the transformation ... choice was given ... negotiated and each party 'Chose' to change because of a real blossoming love and respect for the individual's gradual growth and enlightenment as to what it means to honor and love someone else more than you love yourself. It is a journey with an encouraging outcome.
B002HSSAY6|5.0|I have watched this over and over. Classic western that will be around forever! I highly recommend watching this movie!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|If you don't mind a little reading in this game, you owe it to yourself to play this game. It's brilliant.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I quickly became addicted to this series and have enjoyed the character development and creative plots.  Can't wait to watch season two.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I loved this book. I knew about Anita Moorjani before I read this book which is why I put off buying it for so long - i thought I knew the whole story. However there was a lot more background information in the book which added context. I thought the most important message in the book is that we must stay true to ourselves, and that false positivity is just as damaging as negativity. We need to accept our emotions. I was also comforted by her view of  heaven, nirvana, call it what you will
B00BHMETKC|2.0|I don't quite understand the hype. Historically inaccurate, rah rah interpretation of events. But no fear (spoiler alert): happy end.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Good movie for what it is supposed to be. A crazy fictional possibility that is not too far fetched from happening.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|The fact that this was based on a true story, I would love to know where the reality became movie.. kept my attention throughout
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|creeeeeeeepy game. I love it though! I'm always yelling at the screen and freaking out.. running around like a mad woman. haven't beaten it yet... one day, maybe.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really enjoy this product and would highly recommend this free product. It is the first thing I see when I turn my kindle on.

B004ADB17Y|5.0|Anyone who has not see this movie has been living under a rock! One of my all time faves! I buy this movie in every form possible!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing!! For anyone who hasn't caught on yet this entire trilogy is amazing. I didn't plan on buying them on kindle but i just couldn't wait to make it to walmart or for amazons shipping!!
B006TLFPKO|3.0|The birthing scene was good, but everything else was slow and uneventful. Basically this part1 was setting up for the end. Part 2 was much much better.
B001Q4Z5UY|3.0|I found this movie to be simply okay. It lacked a certain edge I was hoping it would have. Overall an okay watch though.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed playing Magic Academy.  It has beautiful graphics, interesting puzzles that keep your attention but are not so hard you cannot complete them. The hidden objects scenes are varied which keeps you from getting bored!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is an amazing trilogy that I had a very hard time putting down. I ended up ordering the 2 and 3 book on my kindle although I wanted hard copies because I just couldn't wait to continue!
B008C20TDG|5.0|Was able to get off the last few pounds eating as they suggest. It was a bit hard to adjust to, but after 30 days, I have picked up some great new habits.

B000H4TX9I|5.0|I want more! this is one of the best shows ever made for television. Entertaining, well written, acted, etc. So hard to believe it was canceled!
B000ZN802W|5.0|This is based on the book that was written about a true story. This is definitely one of my all time favorite movies I watch it over and over! Anyone who is an adventurer at heart is sure to enjoy this thought provoking movie! Also the soundtrack is amazing Eddie Vedder is brillant!

I understand most people that enjoy to read self-help books for clarity, extra drive, and strength in their faith, relationships, overall health, or careers, etc. will grab a book like \\"The Miracle Morning,\\" read it, love it and then add it to the bookshelf. (Hopefully to read it again...) I personally decided to order 25 copies of the short read...and am now GIVING them out to my clients. I work in direct sales and anyone who does the same will agree that the power of relationships is key. Consequently, I decided to order a bulk supply and wrap them each individually in order to \\"stop-by\\" and give the gift of wisdom to people that I appreciate. I've signed a personal message on the inside cover of each copy to each person I give the book to...AND LET ME TELL YOU, the response has been overwhelming! I've been receiving texts, phone calls, and emails from these influential people in my field stating they \\"can't wait to share it with others\\" and \\"what a great resource\\" the book is to their day, AND I even have some of my clients wanting to order bulk orders of the book for their team of sales people as well! Crazy to see how a little appreciation and positivity can SPREAD! If you skim past the thought of investing into \\"The Miracle Morning\\" for yourself, be sure to consider the concept of showing appreciation to bosses, co-workers, clients, or anyone else by giving them the GIFT that might possibly \\"transform their life.\\"
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Same great characters as in Cranford.  Great sets and photography.  Good moral teaching and engaging storyline.  I feel like I know these good folks.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a very good book - wasn't quite sure how it was going to end.  It dealt with a difficult topic and wondered how I would react if I was in Ms. Clark's shoes.
B005FVNJTS|5.0|well written, entertaining, psychologically frank and inclusive.<br />a unique biography for a unique and adorable champion like rafael  nadal.<br />you can read this book again and again. you will never be tired or bored.<br />RAFA ;my story, is a book, highly recommended, for anyone who wants to read something pleasant and understand how a true champion is formed , by both  nature's gift and , also, the infinite effort, perseverance and sacrifice required on the way to the top and..... beyond. in addition the book compels you to intimately participate in the immense happiness and ,inevitably, disappointments that the athlete goes through.
B003B02O7I|5.0|This was a great story, filled with enough adventure, with twists and turns, to go along with the famous Grisham legal style to keep my interest all the way through.  I enjoy this author, and this book places near the top of my favorites from him.  His characters are all so likeable, even if he leads us into liking to dislike them.  I like how we can identify with all his characters traits, the fantasy of having enough money to be free to live in any way we desire, the issue of death, wills, and the family drama that often ensues when that dream is so close you can taste it.  The exageration of this oft human-reality in his writing style makes for a great read.
B001NHNG64|5.0|fast read, gripping.  new to the reacher series, enjoying every page, plan to read them all as soon as possible
B007IK44CK|5.0|I give it five stars for a movie of this type.  Lot's of action, impossibe stunts, hi tech wizardry, and plenty of old fashioned gun fire and explosions.  Escapists stuff.  Having said that it does have an underlying sentimental plot, one that isn't fully revealed until the end.  Mr. Cruise is at his impossible best and the supporting cast is great.  Make the popcorn and turn up the volume and just enjoy it for what it is, great fun.  And the girls can get all weepy at the end.<br /><br />Domenick
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read half of the first chapter thinking I knew what was going to happen... Then WHAM!  Plot twist!  Wha?!?  What just happened. Kept reading... oh yeah now I know what's going to happen, WHAM plot twist!<br /><br />All I can say is READ THIS BOOK!  Seriously, totally fun and great book!  I could not put it down. Can't wait to read more!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I first found out about this game from my friend who played it on her tablet. I saw it and was like 'huh. That looks a lot like Temple Tim's so when I looked it up on my kindle fire HD and saw it was free I got it immediately! Thu  can  is so fun to play an  the characters are really funny too! It's easy to play also. The only thing is the goal  you have to get to get new characters. Like the amount of items you need to get a new person when you don't get a surprise box a lot, they make you get like...200 thing  that you even barely get one so you're stuck with the same person for a little while but other than that, its amazing!
B0034G4P80|2.0|Don't get me wrong -- I love this movie!  So much so, I wanted the DVD in my collection.  The product was described as having additional material, including missing scenes and director commentary; the DVD version I received did not have these features.  I felt like I'd been Loki'd, so back it went.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Very addictive. Can't put it down. Play it every chance I get. Lots of fun to play, time and time again.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|I bought this album due to a Reddit thread on wonderfully-recorded and produced works, and it is that, and much more.  This is a complicated work but also easy to fall for on first listen.  I expect to listen to it many, many, many times, and at this time my only wish is that it were two hours long.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Great read. The early books are the best. Very good read if you don't mind it being a little preachy.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This is a very exciting release and a cause for celebration for Hendrix fans-Bernie Grundman,Eddie Kramer and Experience Hendrix made a fantastic sounding album from works-in-progress from all those years ago-Get the Target version for the extra track if you can-Ignore the negative reviews-this is a great Hendrix album!
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|This album sounds like anybody rock from 2013 with David Bowie on vocals. Whats made Bowie great in the past is that he's an innovator. Theres nothing innovative, or even interesting, about this album. By playing it safe he leaves us with an album that is simply unremarkable and ultimately, unnecessary.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is fun for everyone. my little siblings were playimg and told me to get it. Now I am ADDICTED
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|DS9 has always been my favorite. It's one of the reasons why I got Amazon Prime. Binging on DS9 episodes is great!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|The Blind Side, as most of us heard, this movie won Sandra bullock the BEST ACTRESS. It is a very good movie. I can't find the right word right now to describe it, but the only thing I can say is, watch it and you will love it.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I love this series the best out of all Star Trek series especially because of Janeway being a women captain
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I am a big Sherlock Holmes fan so I was highly critical of this show at first. However, I'm really enjoying it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|A poet, a philosopher, and damn good story teller. I will never forget this novel. Everyone should<br />read this.!!!  I want to start from the beginning and read it over again. (But it is way too long.) Instead, I'll read another novel he wrote.
B004X75RK4|5.0|The proposal was a combination of serious business and lots of laughter. Sandra and the whole cast were very funny. I will recommend this movie to any family. It is a good movie without dirty languages.
0312430000|5.0|I do not have a business degree and never took any business classes in college. Until recently, my job has been break/fix. Process management was always handled by someone else.  When process management became my responsibility I initially felt like I was floundering. There is a monumental difference between documenting a process as an audit point and documenting a process that is useful for the people who are trying to meet an SLA.<br /><br />Dr. Gawande has written a concise book that outlines a thought process for creating a process that can be &#34;used&#34;. He supports his argument with rich anecdotes that are presented in a way that were easy for me to relate to. I was able to take his process and reduce the error rate in two SLA driven processes by 18% and 28% respectively and this has, in turn, decreased the number of tickets that are reopened by our customers.<br /><br />This is the first &#34;business&#34; book (if it really is that), that I have encountered with practical guidance. There are no swami style platitudes, no affirmations that leave you thinking, WTF?  Just straight forward ideas supported with resedarch and the authors personal experience.<br /><br />I think very highly of this book. It is the only book I have ever bought more than one copy of and handed out to co-workers.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|She's two years old and learning a lot from these games on her nabi junior.  I'm very happy with it all!
B001FVV2X2|4.0|This is an excellent show with lots of original ideas; definitely not a repeat of old shows.  The one thing I personally don't appreciate is today's need to be crude.  One of the characters, Walter, comes up with at least a few very crude remarks in each episode, especially as you progress in the first season.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Para jugar en familia es excelente, solo hay que tener creatividad y manos a las obras para disfrutar de este juego de mesa.
B009329ZF2|3.0|a nice little film with a great deal of action and drama  it seemed to move quickly and it had some kick
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is just one of the best books I have ever read. It takes you to a place that I was very unfamilliar with and characters that are a world away from my expierence both literally and figuratively. Buy it.
B00BHMF578|4.0|A little slow at times but the movie overall is good. A movie to buy or rent for your collection.
B005F9CP7M|5.0|I LOVE this album. Every track is different from the previous track, but it's a Pop album. I can't stop listening to this album. I like how this album is diverse. I've been a life long fan of Melanie C's. And this album proves just how great she is! I love that she is different from other pop artists. Also, I like the album art. Highly recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A powerful and moving portrayal of an incredible family,<br />a woven tapestry of beauty and integrity with rich powerful characters,<br /> that will for generations touch many many lives,<br />I couldn't praise it enough .
B008Q08EV8|3.0|Watching a bunch of guys get hunted by Picts at every turn and in the end it was about one guy who falls in love with one of them. So what was this story about after all???
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|It was an okay movie. Acting was good. Story line could have been better than this was. They need to do another remake.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Too many dropped or poorly developed story lines. If the writing doesn't improve next season, it will become a program taped to watch later, &#34;maybe.&#34;  The actors are still doing well in their roles. Shirley McLain's part was disappointing, and her makeup was terrible.
B00BMVTS1S|2.0|I truly wanted to like this film, sadly i just couldn't.<br /> Frankly i found myself looking at the clock and several times during the film i found myself thinking i would turn it off and go to bed and continue the film later.<br />I found the dialog between characters dull and downright boring, it seemed to lack energy and there were entire segments that i found pointless and mundane.<br />The dialog between The main Character the Hobbit and his supporting lead the Wizard was so dry and forced i found myself yawning.<br />Entire segments of monolog that made no sense were inserted into the film, conversations that seemed to go on and on with no apparent conclusion nor any point of reference .<br />Then there was the posing of the Elvin Queen her dress was more important than her actual character and entire segments were devoted to her posing this way and that way. (a pointless display of her beauty) the entire segment felt forced and exaggerated.<br />The Dialog between the Wizard and his mentor the white wizard were so low key and so softly spoken i had to turn up the volume just to make out what they were saying.<br />Entire conversations with no reason or rhyme about the incapability of the hobbit to make it on the journey were dragged on and on to the point of sheer ludicrous exaggeration .<br />Then just when things got interesting, it was OVER you see the sleepy eye of a dragon open and your done.<br />I apologize to peter Jackson  but this was not where i wanted to go with this film.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved this book. It was even better than the original movie. There are so many things in this book that the movie left out. It was a real page-turner and short enough to be a quick read. It's full of adventure. I loved it and will probably read it again.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Missed it in the theatre because I thought it would not be good but it is. Buy it or rent it.
B005WMADYE|5.0|take a dreamer who wants to win big and a partner who will go down to the crime world to help him reach his goal<br />and you have a great movie.<br />seriously though be prepared to sit for a while
B0091REZMW|5.0|Looks easy but it is does challenge and like the rooms, decor and levels of play with a goal to find extra bonus...
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Let me start with what I love about the conclusion to this Delirium Trilogy.  Lena is fabulous!  She stats off cautiously in the first book, gains confidence and momentum in the second book but in this final installment, she is absolutely a force to be reckoned with.  She finally matures and develops into an incredible heroine that I loved spending my time with.  I also loved that this is by far the most action packed out of the three books.  While the first was more poetic than suspenseful, this book was exciting and a real page turner.  Here is what I did not love:  Hana.  Half the book is told from her point of view and although I get that finding out what is happening with the cured is important, I found these bits dull especially when compared with the excitement of Lena's story.  I was also unhappy with the ending, a little.  I think it left too much unresolved but I feel that that was intentional.  Things don't end perfectly or predictably in life but that is all a part of living.  So if you liked the first two books, you'll love this conclusion.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0089CLOZQ The Inadvertent Thief (The Thief)]]
B00BHMF578|5.0|Enjoyed the movie but expected a bit more from such a highly awarded movie (best picture from Oscars and Golden Globes and others).  Now that we've seen all the best picture nominees for the Oscars, we are rather surprised that this one won.  It is indeed a well made movie with a riveting story, but some of the other nominees were better, in our opinion.
B0006B2A42|5.0|First saw it with my Dad on TV, many years ago.  Loved it then, Love it now.  Acting is very good for a mostly-male cast.  No girly love stories to muddy up the flow of the movie.  Some things are cheesy but mostly everything flowed enough to get lost in the story.  Nice twists and turns for Cold War themes.<br /><br />Glad I bought it!!!
B00B10DZQE|4.0|I rented for my nine year old boy sleepover party and the boys loved it. I found the rental a little pricy but it wasn't on netflex, so it was worth it.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I overclocked this bad boy to 4.0 ghz using a Zalman air cooler....never skipped a beat. Kept up with most games but I play Planetside 2 and that thing is a CPU destroyer, so I got the FX 8350.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Brings a surprising new angle of parallel worlds that can intersect and how changes in one can affect the other.
B00004XPPE|5.0|I just think Henry Fonda (and Walter Matthau) are great actors and I like wartime themes.  Great actors usually make great movies, yes?
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Great Movie, documentary part best.  The Canadians part was way underplayed as they also were TRUE HERO'S.  I bought it because I will want to watch it again.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This movie was fantastic - So nice to see an intelligent, heart-warming movie that shows the power of having good friends in your life.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I love to play this game to relax when I get home from working all day.  It is almost as fun as Bejeweled games.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Good acting, great plane crash scene and lead up to it.  Once that was done, much like life would be for someone who's gone through that I suppose, things become a bit boring and depressing.  Watching an alcoholic struggle and try to function among the sober and lie and deny his way through every situation wears at you.  All and all worth watching though.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read Ender's Game many years ago and have never forgotten it.  Although I read the entire quintet, it was Ender's Game that stayed with me.  Wanting to share the experience with my 11-year-old granddaughter, I gave her the book and ordered the Kindle version for myself so that I could read it again at the same time.  Although it turned out that my granddaughter (an avid reader) was not quite ready for Ender's Game, I read through to the last page - still enjoying every line despite knowing how it would end.
B0000029DD|4.0|buckley had a lot of talent.  really makes you feel bad that he died so young.  he does one of the best covers of hallelulea on this album.
B0099Y2YL6|2.0|Love the show but this review is for the release and in particular for the studio that released the blu ray. - given the price I really don't like the fact that I must watch 2 commericals every time I want to watch a disk - hitting disk menu does not allow the commericals to be skipped and the same commericals are at the beginning of each of the 3 disks<br /><br />I have seasons 1 and 2 in the UK region 2 release and neither of these disk sets have commrercials on them.
B0042JSSVI|4.0|Robert Harris is great writer and i am thankful he did not stay being just a historician but wrote few great books too. This one is kind of a step sideways but still very interesting with unbelievable details.
0307346617|4.0|World War Z is a great introduction to those longer reads. The short chapters and captivating scenes of action and adventure left me speechless. The movie doesn't appear to be as based on the book as Hollywood would have you believe so be wary of watching the movie instead of reading the book. The great thing about this book was jumping from one story to the next getting to hear the exciting and gory details of each account and then going to the next starting over again. I'm a novice reader at best and finished this book in under three days and can't wait for another along the same lines.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was such an inspirational book and at the same time so real. Not sappy or preachy at all. Very down to earth and incredible writing!
B003VANOFY|5.0|These headphones are probably the best in the market if you don't want to spend over 200$<br />The battery life on them are great, I can have them unplugged pretty much all day, the stereo quality is great for gaming and music.<br /><br />only possible con is that the power button some times is tricky, there is a delay for it to turn on and you'll find yourself turning it off accidentally when you're trying to turn it on.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Who doesn't like this game? It's hilarious! It can be frustrating, as some of the levels are a little difficult (ok, really difficult), but all in all, it's fun, and funny!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I honestly love this game,its so!! Addicting and i cld play for hours...but i also hope they come out with home design story;)
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Like alll the  music I purchased good to model of off when doing runway and do choreography for a urban modeling show.
B004XIZK5K|3.0|This book has a lot of good information in it. The exercises and routines are well described and illustrated. What is even better is that they also include pictures of incorrect forms which is definitely guiding me in the right direction.<br /><br />With that being said, however, I would pay someone good money to extract to distill the essence of workouts described within. This book is dripping with so much testosterone and that it makes a lot of the book incoherent and very difficult to get through. I have never skimmed a book so much, skipping nonsense stories of bad-ass boxers being taken down a notch by kettlebell workouts and the like.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This was for my Granddaughter, who is 7. Its a lot of fun! You can name your horse, feed it, brush it...etc, etc. AND she can play with her friends, and visit their farms too! Definitely would reccomend...Even for adults! :)
B0084670FU|5.0|This riveting movie tells the story of several families who are linked through a set of challenging circumstances. The characters are multidimensional and interesting, more like real people than typical movie characters. I recommend this movie.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|not very long but fun while you play. Grafics<br /> and music are great. I first downloaded the free trial and enjoyed it so much I bought it.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Different game, relaxing and sometimes intense. I like it, it's a nice diversion.<br />Good alternative to the same old, same old.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is fun and addicting! Even my 5 year old grandson loves it. It takes some skill, but is not too difficult. Awesome!
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love the show. The 2nd season has not been as excitng as the first. Some game changers happen that once you fall in love with the characters, you may be a bit disappointed by.... But all and all, I love this show! It is exciting and fun. Emily is a bad a**!!!
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|It was better than I remembered from television.  Very enjoyable and a lot of fun for a nice evening at home.
B009HNDCC4|3.0|Three seasons were brilliant but now it just seems we have seen it all before - still great characters but the inevitable addition of a baby to the storyline to boost ratings hasn't really worked for me
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is great....BUT...you dont earn money fast enough, or diamonds. I REFUSE to spend REAL, hard earned money on this. Although I like the game, you also MUST have friends to get anywhere! I dont want to worry about that! That's what Facebook is for, thank you. Argh!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm addicted to the show! I love the graphics and it is just plain ole gory fun! Darryl is my favorite!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show.  Just wished they had more episodes!  I can not wait to see season three.  A must see.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was one of those stubborn women who when Fifty shades of gray came out I decided I was not going to get into it. Boy was I wrong! Fifty shades darker is just as good if not better than the first one. I fell in love with most of the characters and it was so hard to put down. And the even better thing is that there is another one after darker!!!!!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Yikes! Be warned...this game IS addicting! I have worn down my kindle battery  playing this game...LOL  Really fun though! Pretty identical to the ones found online.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Our whole family enjoyed it! Great and safe for the whole family.Do not find many films to day that are.
B006PKGO40|5.0|It's a tale as old as time. A strong lady kicking some ass.  They only come around every once in a while.  The waves can be measured that they create and Bridgette Nelson portrayed that stature of a Women to its fullest.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is wonderful! It's like reading a classic novel, but better! Anyone who loves English shows or book will love this show!
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|Wonderful acting. Beautiful sets and costumes. Period pieces are one of my favorite genres. This movie probably appeals more to women than men.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am reading this on my new Kindle H D.  So much better than paperback.  This book is fabulous. It is so spell-binding that it is hard to put down. I can only imagine what Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed have in store for me,  All I can say is OMG!
B008WZHWCE|3.0|Great presentation of life events and cycles. Very enjoyable movie for all ages.dealing with peoples trategies sorrow and happeness<br />.
B008K7RGA2|5.0|I loved this production of the opera Tosca, the set, direction and acting was excellent.  The singing was wonderful by all and Bryn Terfel's portrayal of the character Scarpia was particularly notable.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who loves great opera.
B006OV7RQ4|5.0|This film explores the life of someone who has left a cult and how that person must re-adjust and cope with what they have experienced. It is a very interesting film for anyone who loves thrillers, indie films, or is interested in cult activity in America.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love this book very much I gave it five stars because this book felt really real about stuff that would happen  like deformed face,popularity,teens,bully ,friends ,school ,family, divorce,that's what this book had  and the characters felt real had real reacts and emotions. The bully I hated but I don't want to spoil it for the people that want to read this book. This book felt really real you might get emotional kinda disgusts but I love this book very much this is the book I would always remember bye people :)
B001CDLATE|5.0|I saw this when it was in theaters.  This was better. This is a stunning view of the people of Earth.
B00381A1MU|5.0|This car also has some great surprises.  I am just thrilled and so was my three year-old grandson.  He loves having it pick-up rubbish.
B009DA74ES|5.0|Love this show!!! Arrived on time. You will enjoy this series. It is a absolute must!!! Yes buy it .
B003M70O5O|5.0|Makes other shows not worth watching. I can't wait to catch up to the latest season. Btw season 5 should be free on prime (amazon)
B008N9AAQ4|4.0|The same video style as Baraka however it was the dark side of humanity presented.  Where Baraka is uplifting Samsara is quite depressing. I take away the fifth star due to subject matter.
B00BHMF578|4.0|It's an amazing story, hard to believe this actually happened. It was great to see the real life pictures and compare them to the movie.
B00BHMF578|3.0|I thought this was a good movie, but after winning all the awards, my expectations may have been too high.  If you were unfamiliar with the hostage crisis maybe this would hit you as being more compelling than I found it.
B000QCQ8Y4|1.0|I love this trash, but Child didn't bother to have anyone who has lived or worked in LA edit this.  Even a simple map would have prevented these obvious geographic errors.  Sunset Blvd east until you hit the 15?  Lmao.  6 minutes on Sunset to get from Dodger stadium to the strip?  Please.  Pathetic.  Is the rest of the &#34;factual&#34; information as inaccurate?
B00B2064IY|3.0|As a listener who recently commented on a recent 2013 posthumous CD album (BEAUTIFUL by TEENA MARIE) , I find that THE 2013 JIMI EXPERIENCE is. . . posthumous. I love the  'liveliness' of the first panoramic song- EARTH BLUES. From what i hear , it makes one 'feel' the 'gonna take you higher' experience that JIMI talked about before his unexpected death- BUT 'MAYBE' HEARD FROM  JIMI'S 'HEAVENLY' EXPERIENCE.<br /><br /> As far as the rest of the CD, the producer did a great job in 'lifting-up' JIMI'S voice so that a person can be able to hear the crispiness of what Jimi's saying.<br /><br /> Again, i appreciate the historical artistry of Jimi-yet this CD fits in a 'depressing' side of music- THE BLUES. Because of this, Jimi lives up to this genre of POSTHUMOUS music. (i.e. Unlike the vitality found in the posthumous TEENA MARIE'S CD that i have already commented on .)<br /><br /> ON A FINAL NOTE, maybe \\"PEOPLE,HELL & ANGELS\\" will bring back BLUE-ROCK : THE MUSIC TAKING YOU 'HIGHER'.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I read all the books a d watched all the movies. I much more prefer the books. However, the book could have used more of a climax ending which they made up for in the movie.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I wanted to see how this app would work for my 12 & 14 year-old at school.  They use their  kindles at school now.  This is working great for my son who is ADD/ADHD combination.  He doesn't lose his notes, and is a little more organized.  I even use this at work, a folder for each client, color coordinated, and 500+ pages.  Best part is saves on paper, you can even make your notes into a pdf, and print them out.  This is wonderful for kids who lose papers!!!
0374214913|4.0|I had heard people talking about how great this book was and when Amazon proclaimed it a \\"Best of the Month\\", I decided it was time to find out for myself.<br /><br />Largely set in a hole-in-the-wall bookstore in San Francisco, there is a little something for everyone in this book. The bookstore is run by a quirky older gentleman who keeps the store open 24-hours a day. There are very few customers and the most recent clerk (who is our protagonist and runs the shop during the night time hours) can't figure out how it is staying in business. Many of the folks who do stop in seem to fit a familiar profile and he is soon able to identify the unusual characters coming in with a purpose from the folks who happen to drop in to browse the few popular/more recent books limited to the very front of the store. He is required to record in a log a description of each customer and details about the transaction. Things are very odd and as he slowly begins to uncover what is going on behind the scenes, an ancient society working on a project for hundreds years is discovered.<br /><br />Quite original in ideas, there is a flavor of Harry Potter for adults (black robes, etc.). There is also the uncovering of secrets long held and passed from person to person like those found in the novels of Dan Brown. There is also the utilization of technology (particularly Google) to try to unravel the mystery. A romance or two is present to give a dash of that flavor. Nerds making good and becoming wealthy and powerful is also a theme throughout the book. There is a bit here for every reader --- fantasy, suspense, and modern day technology. While I enjoyed the book and am very glad to find out what all the fuss is about, everything didn't come together for me in the satisfying read I thought I would experience. It was actually too little of a lot of things and they didn't blend together well enough for me --- a bit like soup that is put together, heated up and served immediately. A long day simmering on the stove makes a better soup and allows the flavors to meld together. A bit more time taken on various storylines would have made more more interested in the stories.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Enjoyable, glad I read it, didn't live up to it's full potential.<br /><br />Additional note: Anyone look at the hardback cover in the dark? Notice anything?mering on the stove makes a better soup and allows the flavors to meld together.

B00123KEPK|5.0|Released in the UK in December 1973 and to the rest of the world a month later, TfTO elicited hot-or-cool reviews from the music press and outright rejection from some fans. The album's ambitious symphonic structure and intimidating length are unique in Yes' 30+ year recording history, and remain mildly controversial even now (one of the album's enduring legacies is its reputed inspiration for the movie `Spinal Tap').<br /><br />Hard on the heels of the success of the seminal `Close to the Edge', Anderson and Howe worked together on the concept of writing a kind of symphony inspired by the Buddhist Shastric scriptures. The result is four thematically-connected 20-minute pieces each with its own grand-sounding title ('The Revealing Science of God' etc), the length of each dictated by the 1970s vinyl format i.e. one piece of music per `side' of vinyl.<br /><br />This project was the first to feature Alan White, who took over the drum-seat from founder-member Bill Bruford following the latter's departure to work with Robert Fripp and John Wetton in the newly-reconstituted King Crimson. White fits right in with the `Yes style'; the remaining musicians are the same line-up as `Fragile' & CTTE, though following the TfTO recording sessions Rick Wakeman famously decided to quit the band in frustration (though not for good...he re-joined Yes after 2 years).<br /><br />TfTO is not immediately sing-along accessible and were it to be recorded in the formula-driven commercial climate of the 21st century would probably be considered un-saleable. It's a good thing it wasn't. This music rewards repeat-listening, and with a 40-year retrospective we can see TfTO contains some of the most interesting and sublime musical passages Yes ever came up with. It flows and involves, taking the attentive listener on a musical journey through landscapes exotic and strange.<br /><br />If the album has a weakness, it's paradoxically the flip-side of its strength: there's no hit-single material here, no catchy tunes - though there are some wonderfully memorable set-pieces. The scale of its ambition sets it apart from most music of the period and since, including all of Yes' subsequent recordings.<br /><br />If you only know the reputation of TfTO (generally not great) but have never actually listened to it, now might be a good time to go there. If you haven't heard it since the 1970s you might be surprised how good it is; a more mature palette might appreciate its subtleties and the richness of its fine musical passages. Admittedly it's not all great; but some of it definitely is and the overall result is not much short of sublime.<br /><br />The 2003 remix is a marvel and reveals the original music in all its glory, the dynamics fully restored from the analogue tapes. In addition to the four pieces on the original album, you get studio run-through versions of `Dance of the Dawn' and `Giants under the Sun'.<br /><br />Even Rick Wakeman later admitted that his personal criticism of the project had been harsh, and that he subsequently enjoyed playing many of the sections. His tasteful and inventive contributions to the overall result remain exemplary.e, no catchy tunes - though there are some wonderfully memorable set-pieces.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Just started playing Beach Buggy Blitz and it is fun. All the Kids love it and begged.me to download it. I did and cant get enough of it myself.
0143034901|3.0|I expected great things, considering the reviews. The book was solid in its themes and describing the time of the events. It is very well written and in depth. For me it moved along too slowly and took for ever for something startling to happen. To me it was too much like an historical novel, I prefer something faster or lighter like  A Traveller In Time by  Alison Uttley.<br /><br />If you like a solid read, describing and achieving the mood of the era, i would recommend this book.<br /><br />Rating Eight out of Ten<br /><br />RayL
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The ending of episode 9 of season 3 eroded the fine storytelling from the series.  Obviously this was a last minute edit.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful disaster was exactly that. You were shocked at points you fell in love with the characters and their relationships. It was great! I would recommend it to anyone who prefers this type of book!
0345522478|5.0|I loved this book! Hilarious, captivating, action packed... I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I Love this program.  It's a soap opera played in a different era with beautiful scenery.  I love how the old Matriarch come across as a snob with a heart of gold.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Just finished this book.  Very well written and gives us an insight into the struggles, fear and mindset of those afflicted with this horrible disease.  Definitely would recommend,
B00B23O96A|4.0|Not your typical Clapton, but I really like it.  It's a perfectly mellow album that still provides many fine vocals and his blues riffs.  Glad I bought it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Courtroom drama combined with detective work drive the story in this novel. But it also gets into the psyche of the accused, leaving the reader to ponder the \\"what ifs\\" of how you would react if a loved one was accused of a terrible crime.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|You will enjoy the fantastic Alaskan wilderness scenery and story line.  Emile Hirsh was an excellent fit for the part.  enjoy!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I loved this book and spent too much time reading it.<br />I particularly liked reading the history of the German Fighter Pilot and how both pilots got together long after the end of the war.<br />If you like reading about doing the right thing even if could get you in a heap of trouble this is the book for you!
B005LLSZNM|3.0|Like the series a lot - for some reaseon - this season was not my favorite. Still very much worth watching.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Fantasy combines with fiction in this peculiar tale. Imaginative cast of characters with intriguing twists of plot.  The pictures throughout lend to the sense of surrealism.
0062014536|2.0|SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />Disappointment doesn't express how I feel about the way this series ended. So many unanswered questions!!!! What happens between Lena and Alex? Between Lena and Julian? Lena and her mother? Who wins the war? Hana? Fred? I feel like I wasted my time.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is such a great show.  Good combination of sci-fi and western.  Feels almost more western most of the time.  A lot of these actors have done other things and the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; brings the season to a good jumping off point for a second.  Highly recommend if you liked Stargate or the new Star Trek movie.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|I didn't even get a chance to play this game because it won't even open on my kindle fire. What a disappointment and a waste of time.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|wish energy came quicker but i still love it....I need friends please add me I play it all the time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of futuristic novels. Highly recommended and those who don't usually read this type may really enjoy it also.
B00BL5YQKS|2.0|This series was too degenerate for my taste.  There was a lot of visual and verbal grunge and not much else.  After about 30 minutes I stopped it and found something better to watch.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I find Mahjong Kindle tablet edition fun when you first get into it. Then it gets boring unless you are playing it when you are time challanged..
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is very cool. It's fun to see how these dinosaurs evolve. Of course this game is a time eater. But it's fun none the less. The dinosaurs have cool sounds when you collect money from them,and the graphics are very nice to look at. If you like Jurassic park I would definitely recommend this game!
B0026772N8|3.0|Book was okay as far as I was able to read. Very dry and may have just been me at the time. May revisit it in the future
B0091REZMW|5.0|so addicting. this game passes my time. all of my family is playing this game. good job to the creators.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I do not claim to be objective when it comes to Tolkien. The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings are my all time favorite books.  I have not sure how many times I have read them.  Peter Jackson must love the stories as much as I do to bring them to the screen with such care.  I love this movie and recommend it to anyone who loves adventure.<br /><br />This is the second title I have bought on Amazon as a digital only version in the last month.  The chance to own it early and to watch it on all my devices for a great price is just too good to pass up.  Having the bonus material on the back end of the movie is a big plus that I did not expect.  Having your video library on Amazon is a great option.  I have struggled with the limits and issues around UV digital.  Amazon is doing it right.  (An other great bonus of digital only is that when someone asks to borrow it, I can just say \\"Oh I am sorry, I can't do that).<br /><br />I recommend to everyone that if you don't have a Amazon Video compatible player connected to your TV's that you remedy that right away.  There are so many options now.  The addition of the WII was very welcome.  Between what is available on Prime and for purchase and rent, Amazon keeps us entertained.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|As a Dr Who fan I think I must have seen this story a few times over already.<br />It's not that it's a badly written book or a poor premise. It's simply been done before.<br />Personally I found the writing slow and over descriptive. I'm not in awe of dystopian stories<br />there were loads of them around not that long ago. Parts of this reminded me of Outlander or Total Recall for example.<br /><br />It is what it is. I'm pleased for the author that it's found an audience, but it's not something I'm<br />that keen on.<br /><br />Something I did find intriguing was [[ASIN:B00BQKUASA Sean Yeager Hunters Hunted (Sean Yeager Adventures)]]<br />Which goes to show that there are hidden gems out there.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|My daughter sent this to me. Have watched it twice and learn more each time. I feel a lot of the motivational talks and readings base their information on this. It has helped me already and I am a firm believer in it.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|I downloaded and tested a couple of media player for my Kindle Fire HD as the standard player seem to only play MP4 format with AAC audio.  This one is ok but I deleted it since the Mobo Player are more stable in my experience.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Ok, so I remember Noah Wyle from his days as the new kid in surgery on the hit TV show ER.  It was really hard for me to imagine him as a gun toting alien annihilator.  But once I started watching Falling Skies I discovered a new found respect for him as an actor.  Throughout the series you find yourself imagining the unimaginable, trying to fathom a world where a pediatrician is thrust into the role of combat surgeon, forced to patch more than just the random toddler paper cuts; or a first year med student is now wielding a blow torch to assist taking off a really disgusting living alien harness that enslaves human children.  I found myself seeing the irony of a college history professor once fighting for tenure, now finding himself using his knowledge of world atrocities to again attempt to save humankind from an unprecedented threat.<br /><br />This series is surprisingly well thought out and executed...it doesn't inundate you with fake looking aliens or bore you with predictable story lines.  Instead, it expands on the notion that we may not be alone in our fight for freedom.  It actually expands that concept celestially and forces one to look outside of our own struggles and find common ground with the most unlikely of allies, both human and otherwise.<br /><br />So even though at first I really didn't think I would like this series, I find myself really enjoying the twists and turns and the unexpected depth of each of the characters.  Just when you think it's safe to breathe again...there's another jolt to your psyche...so if you're on season one...just wait til you see season 2...it'll have you craving more, trust me! Until later, happy hunting!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like this game but wish that it would have more levels, it's hard to get the new ones downloaded
B004QX07G4|3.0|Not what I expected. Couldn't finish it and would not recommend to anyone to try reading this book. Not even worth the special price.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is one of the first app i installed on the Kindle Fire and never had problem with the app.
B000VXJMYG|5.0|This is a great collection of songs.  For those not familiar with Suprtramp, take a chance.  This is good stuff!
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|David Weber does it again! Great read! Make sure to start with &#34;On Basilisk Station&#34; if this is your first time seeing the Honor series.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Locked himself in the man cave and only came out for food!  He gives it five stars and is ready for the next season!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this app. It just works and no problem at all.  This is one app that will stay on my Kindle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|An excellent game for horse lovers, once you get the hang of how to keep the horses stats up it's relatively easy to play...does take some time to accumulate money and gems. I highly recommend joining the forum, loads of friendly and helpful people there. There are pop up ads (at least on the kindle fire HD) that can become quite intrusive, I was told buying some gems (65, at 3 dollars) can take care of this problem. I still feel it's an excellent game with outstanding graphics and any horse lover should check it out.
B006E2VTG2|5.0|I hate to say this..but I love this movie. You can't ask for more action than this movie. I actually watch it every night on my Kindle. This is what I fall asleep watching. Excellent movie.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Something different from all the crime or medical dramas on television today.  I have really enjoyed the first 3 episodes.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My 5 and 3 year old kid loves this app. They love hearing Tom repeats everything they say and copy their laughs as they play with this app. It is a good time killer for the kids.
B00ARAO720|3.0|It was very entertaining if you are looking for cheap thrills. the stunts are awesome and the humor is funny. Some of the supporting actors are not all that real but Joseph Gordon-Levitt is good as always.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|I had read this book in high school and this haunting story had stuck with me,  i was both excited and nervous to watch those characters come to life.  Gemma is one of my favorites and she played Tess just as i had pictured her!  I was disappointed in Angel, but the ending had me crying with him.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|My first Macklemore album, I enjoy the anti-consumerism lyrics and catchy beats.  Not the same old hip hop. Look forward to more from this artist.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|This allows me to play all the video file format i throw in Kindle Fire HD that the regular video play cant play.
B009EANE3M|5.0|I love every song and feel like the script has come a long way. Very emotional songs and lyrics, job well done!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series has been a breath of fresh air from all the garbage we normally have to endure on television.  The cast is amazing and story lines are great.  I won't do any spoilers in case someone reading hasn't watched it yet, but I will say this season was very rocky due to gained fame of some of the actors.  But I'm so hoping the show can hang on to the essence of Downton that made us all fall in love with it from the beginning.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is something that I can do while waiting in a doctor's office, bus, train or plane.  Also in long, slow-moving line.
B0035XVVDY|1.0|Bad video quality. Cant figure out how to get refund for this video I rented the other day man. so can somebody hepl me get refund on this item
B005HSL626|4.0|Fun app, a few different game modes, force closed a few times due to freezing but may have just been my kindle
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|This is one of my Russel Crowe favorites.  All the actors are superb, and the story is excellent as well.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Not much I can say bout this except I absolutely love it. The characters were spot on (Especially Bones). The story was great. And i love how they completely opened up a whole new universe for the characters to behave in different ways than from the original series.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Acting was fantastic.  Interesting insight into the world of Mr. Hitchcock, his wife and the making of the infamous Psycho.
1476712042|5.0|This book was a total rollercoaster but I loved the story. I can see why Abby struggled so much to stay with Travis but it was clear they were meant to be. It was hard sometimes reading about his fights but that's who he is, and the reality is Abby wasn't perfect either. She made a lot of dumb decisions going back to Parker while Travis waited for her. The ending seemed super quick but I'm glad how it wrapped up.<br /><br />My only complaint is the nickname Pigeon. really? Who on earth would call their girlfriend that? And I would hope no girl would ever WANT that as a nickname!
B00280LYIC|5.0|My son enjoyed this book tremendously.  He says it was full of fun and adventure and he learned a lot about Greek Mythology.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so addicting and creative.I love how the cop is fat and has an ugley dog<br />And how they dress up for each holiday it is funny.
B005HSL626|5.0|Excellent transaction. quick shipment. Thank you.  Happy to have this game.  It's a lot of fun.  Will share with friends
B0000060NH|5.0|Album is just great mix of R&B and Jazz...I don't think Marvin put out bad music.  My son digs this more than I do and it was released twenty years before he was born.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The setting is beautiful and timeless, a real treat for us who don't know that side of the country.<br />All the essences of a classic love story, with magic, voodoo, and a little something extra thrown in.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I like the game a lot, just don't like you can't get real far in the levels without having to actually purchase more gems.  Want to be able to go farther in game for free:)
B0037VNX44|2.0|This movie wasn't as interesting as I was expecting. I understand it was supposed to be violent and sarcastic at the same time but it just wasn't interesting.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I am a Marvel Fan.  Totally  enjoyed the move.  Something about the super powered human crime fighther that gives me hope for the future.  Art immitates life!!
B00A7ZX37A|4.0|Not as good as her last album but my kids seem to love it. It's still a good buy.. recommended
B00A757EFW|5.0|who doesnt love Pacman, i mean it's like great, like that I could download & play this one. Enjoy it
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is another used video that was lots cheaper than new, and is in absolutely mint condition. The whole HP series is great fun, and as an added bonus I got all of the videos for something like 30 bucks, buying used, and that's WITH shipping.
B008518MOW|4.0|Good movie, but not as entertaining as the first Men In Black. My inspiration to purchase was The Tommy Lee & Will Smith duo.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|This is another solid album from Maroon 5.. This could be one of their best albums.. I highly recommend this..
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|As Bond movies go, this one doesn't disappoint.  There is the expected good action scenes - and lets face it, we gotta have our Bond chase / fight scenes - and there is, of course, a few romantic interest for James to ponder.<br /><br />The story is slow in building but has a nice twist at the end to keep interest high for the next installment.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|This album crept up on me.  The first time I listened to it &#34;Lonely Boy&#34; was the only track I really got into.  Now, every time I listen I hear something new and I've decided there's not a bad song on the whole album!  Highly recommend!
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Another great book by Lee Child.  He invites you into the scene with his style of writing.  You see what he sees whilst he is writing the bok.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|This was a pretty good movie.. It could have been a lot better with a higher budget BUT if you are a Halo fan.. This movie is a MUST WATCH!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I had no pre-conceived notion when I purchased this book and I am glad I didn't.  I loved the storyline and the characters. The story is told from the point of view of \\"Death\\" who traces the life of a young German girl, a small German town during WWII, and its people.<br />I won't say too much, but encourage everyone who is looking to escape and read war from a very different angle to give \\"The Book Thief \\" a try. It is refreshing, charming and an great insight into human nature, without being judgemental.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A wonderfully told love story ... without all the sex.  I really enjoyed the simplicity of it.  I wonder if they'll have a family!
B0031RS4UM|4.0|Great read, recommend it to all.  I like how the author writes so well and makes you feel you are right there with Jack.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Kinda funny, sort of predictable, love Johnny Depp, just thought it would be even funnier, alas it was not, ok to rent.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Grabs your attention and does not let go until the end of the book. Can't wait to see the movie.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|Our house is somewhat divided on the terminator movies- I like the first 3, my husband only the first 2.  However, we both agree that the tv show was a fun watch.  It tends to focus on the relationship between man & machine and the resulting drama.  There's plenty of action & it's decently acted.  If you like the movies give it a try
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I bought this cover for my kindle, not realizing it would not fit the Kindle Fire HD. I know it would be great for someone that knew what they were doing.  Always make sure....
B004NOH9LC|4.0|A cute yet predictable movie. Rachel McAdams is charming and adorable as always.  But what really kept my interest was Harrison Ford's hysterical voice he uses in this movie.  It was refreshing to see him in a rom-com after being the loveable bad boy hero in so many other action/thriller films.
B008PJ3IDO|5.0|If you're tired of having your ears mauled by teeny-bopper screeching, treat them to a dose of Walking Papers. Their grungy, bluesy rock sound is heaven in the neverending sea of banshees hitting the airwaves today. This is one album where I truly can't pick a song I dislike and it's been a while since that's happened.<br /><br />Get off my lawn and get this in your hands!
B00BJK4SE4|5.0|I'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan. I've read all the original canon, listened to a number of the radio plays, watched the various movie and TV Holmeses over the years. When I first heard about Elementary, I expected it to be terrible. It sounded like the stereotypically awful Hollywood pitch. You could practically hear it: \\"There's a modern Sherlock Holmes series doing well, so let's make our own. But let's move it to New York, and make Watson a hot woman (will audiences be OK with a woman doctor? Make her a paid companion instead, like that woman on Monk). Ooh, Holmes does drugs, right? That won't play in Peoria, so ours is in rehab.\\" Everything I heard about it sounded terrible. And maybe the original pitch was that bad, but I was bored one day and watched it anyway... and they actually made it work. The move to New York and the addiction/rehab and Watson's status as an ex-surgeon are not only addressed, but addressed thoughtfully, in a way integral to the show's overall plot arc. In fact, in many ways the result is much more faithful to the original stories than similar series, in terms of Holmes's relationship with the police and with Watson. Other shows have erred in the direction of making Holmes more of a jerk in the Gregory House mold; in Elementary he seems just genuinely too excited about the cases to care about the social niceties. The bees are a nice touch, too, and used to good effect.<br /><br />The individual show plots are interesting and entertaining. They're occasionally predictable (the one with M. especially so) and I wish they'd done more with Holmes's suspension, but they make good use of their ensemble. While they've taken the characters from the original stories, they seem to have avoided recreating the actual original cases. (Or rather, if they have been, it's been too subtle for me!) In some ways, this is a disappointment, making the show a little more generic, with plots that could work with Monk or Castle. But on balance I think it's wise toavoid overtly mirroring the original cases; it's freed them to suit the cases more to the setting and to include moments for broad character arcs.<br /><br />The general attitude behind the show seems to be to try harder to recreate the feel than to recreate the particulars, and so far I think they've succeeded.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I play it whenever I go in the car and in between my breaks in dance class and on the way to sporting events I love this game but it is kinda addicting.but besides that it is a very fun way to waste your time !!!!!!!!!!!:)
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I can NOT believe the big deal about this book.  My friend read it and loved it, I borrowed it from her and glad I didn't spend the $ on it!  If James didn't use the SAME sentences/descriptions of her 'warm sensation' or whatever that was a hundred times over, then she didn't use it at all!! Plus the dialogue was so WEAK!!  There was no good writing here at all, just a lot of repetition and only a 'little' titillation  ...I guess most of the readers who subscribe to this being a sensational story lead VERY VANILLA lives or don't do a whole lot of reading!  At best, it's a 2 star book!  I won't read the other two in the trilogy...perhaps I'll write my own!
0201485672|5.0|This book is replete with advanced knowledge of the situational logic of refactoring code in procedural and object oriented languages  ...  The point of view is that of a software engineer inclined to perfectionism  ...  Many typical kinds of bad code from a module or a function or a method or a class are outlined in Chapter 3 item by item 22 different situations are described and critiqued  ...  Much of the remainder of the book outlines what remedies the principal author and the other authors suggest as to how to refactor the code to meet this book's standards  ...<br /><br />One doubt immediately comes to mind:  what about the economics in industry of refactoring?  Whilst I agree, say, that a car self parking system needs to be well nigh perfect in that this is the only way to assure safety for car drivers and nearby pedestrians, many an employer will say no just say no to refactoring exercises for perfection's sake!  For example, many financial systems have the odd unimportant user interface bug that there's simply not the funds to get fixed.<br /><br />And every source code change involves risks:  the risk that bugs are introduced;  the risk that the unit and system testing will be inadequate;  the risk of feature drift, the application semantics being misunderstood;  and, the risk of loss of source code though related hardware failure.  Source code control systems and people employed as change managers need to question whether the risk of some minor change should be countenanced, or rejected if too risky!<br /><br />It is possible that too many refactoring exercises might take a large system that works well and lead to it degenerating into an unholy mess, with added introduced bugs, the destruction of the original architect's vision, and changes that erode the system's integrity and purpose.  This is a management problem.  Quality code is not free.  If a large system really needs extentive refactoring the real question is as to whether over the expected lifetime of the code it would be cheaper to refactor, or to throw the system away and start from scratch!<br /><br />It is overall more advisable to get the system right in the first place.  A better design with a better architecture if put together for a hypothetical version 1 of a large system will reduce maintenance cost down the track  ...<br /><br />Nevertheless an excellent book of practical advice on refactoring and code quality!<br /><br />An advanced reference work for third year university software engineering students, practising software engineers, and software engineering managers.  Managers whose background is other than a career in programming would particularly benefit from this work.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Love and sex between two very young adolescents in the 1960's, by director Wes Anderson, in his own idiosyncratic manner.  Whether you like it may depend on what you think of the director and also composer Benjamin Britten, whose music and music commentary is featured.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this application is not hard to understand. Can see the designs very easy. I would recommend this game to all.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|Since this book was on the New York Times best seller list, I thought it would be delicious. Instead, I found it tedious. The author didn't create enough suspense to keep me eagerly turning the pages. I don't think Jane Austin would be pleased with this take-off on her books.
0321334876|5.0|In learning programming, different textbooks suit different purposes  ...<br /><br />Let's divide up the task of becoming a C++ software engineer specialising in programming challenging systems  ...<br /><br />(1)  learning the essentials of programming;<br />(2)  learning the essentials of low level programming with its bit fiddling logical operators and implementation issues;<br />(3)  learning C++ syntax;<br />(4)  learning C++ development tools;<br />(5)  picking up knowledge of the situational logic of software engineering;<br />(6)  picking up knowledge of object oriented and procedural and other approaches to programming solutions to given problems and picking up the common sense to know the best approach to a given problem;<br />(7)  learning C++ libraries;<br />(8)  learning STL the standard template library;<br />(9)  picking up knowledge so that one can develop an appropriate C++ style to the task at hand, whatever the task at hand may be  ...  knowing that educational miniprojects and real medium sized to large systems have different needs in this respect.<br /><br />In this matter I am trying to distinguish knowledge and skills.  I maintain that this book essentially deals with topics (2)  (5)  (6)  (7)  and  (9)  as outlined above, with application to the perculiarities of C++.  In other words, this is an advanced work and should not be the first C++ book a first year university student should buy!  First things first you need to buy a language primer  ...<br /><br />Nevertheless once one has mastered the basics of C++ this is an excellent work to start picking up rules of C++ style.  Helpfully the author includes a number of items which describe typical C++ blunders that result from inadequate mastery of the basics of C++.  Therefore after learning the basics of C++ most students would benefit by reading this book cover to cover!  The explanations are clear and terse and if contemplated will enable many a conceptual misunderstanding of typical C++ semantics in C++ typical implementations to be clarified.<br /><br />From earlier editions some of the advice has changed.  There is a helpful table pp277-9 that describes a mapping of relevant items between the 2nd and 3rd editions!  That the author has consolidated and clarified his advice on good C++ style is a good thing given how often he is cited in both industry and academia.  Some advice has been updated to deal with the C++ 11 standard adopted two years ago;  some has been updated to deal with the latest in C++ development technologies and libraries  ...<br /><br />Well worth reading even for the experienced programmer.  Well worth buying even if you have an earlier edition.  I really must find time now to read this properly cover to cover  ...  as I've read two of his earlier works!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very cliff hangerish and every times stopped reading, I wanted more! I need the other books now!!!
B00A25NLOU|5.0|This gives me the same feeling I got when I first watched the first Harry Potter movie. Mysterious, tech-oriented, and very contemporary.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|This story had all the makings of something great... and it was expertly destroyed.<br /><br />The entire aspect of this being a story told with religious intents should have been removed. The religious messages in the actual story told by Pi are perfectly fine, but the messages the movie itself tries to send with the building and falling action doomed the movie to mediocrity.<br /><br />If you remove the first and last ten minutes or so of the movie, it would have been absolutely epic.<br /><br />The visual effects, the emotional turmoil, the life-in-the-balance struggles, the twists, all were superb... if only it didn't begin and end with whispers and whimpers... You could remove the intro and ending add just a minute to the story and make this an epic tale of survival in the most incredible of circumstances, albeit with a rather fantastically mystical ambiance at times, but the attempts to weakly convey a religious message ruined the entire drama.<br /><br />More telling, perhaps, is that it even failed on delivering on its own religious message. Not so much as causing one to think for a second as to its initial claims... except to wonder when the big moment was to come, only to be greeted with the closing credits.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I have been using YAHOO mail for years and have had not complaints.  Like the looks of it and ease of use.
B006HH5ZM8|4.0|This album SEEMS like a miss or possibly a total failure when you first listen.  Maybe even the first ten times you listen to it.  This album is actually really great, phenominal even.  I think you have to have the emotions hit a nerve just the right way, then you 'totally get it'.  It might take a while, but this album is GREAT.  It will grow on you.  The songs are mature and warm, \\"Something In The Air\\" is one of Bowie's best songs in his entire career.  It is far withdrawn from what we recieved on \\"Outside\\" and \\"Earthling\\", but it's a full transition to \\"Heathen\\" and \\"Reality\\".
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved the whole series. It was a whole new way to look at Vampires and it was a beautiful love story. I  loved the way she made the charators think, So funny at times and others so deep and I felt I knew Bella personally. I was drawn into the story and wanted more and more and I still do!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Don't get me wrong; this movie is very well made. It was well acted, shot and directed. I was never bored.<br /><br />But I started out watching a movie about a hit man who shoots mob victims sent back in time from the future, and knows that his final victim will be his older self. Interesting idea--even if it's not very plausible. But okay, let's just run with it. That's the movie I saw in the trailers, the one I expected to see.<br /><br />So, when his future self comes back, present-day self hesitates for a moment and future self gets the drop on him and runs off. Now present-day self must hunt down and kill future self. Also interesting.<br /><br />SPOILER FOLLOWS<br /><br />But then, it's all about a telekinetic farm kid who will one day rule the world with an iron fist. . . er, brain. . . if he isn't stopped.<br /><br />Huh. . . ? Where the hell did that come from? I know, I know, it's foreshadowed by showing us that 10% of the population has trivial telekinetic powers. They can make coins float above their hands.<br /><br />But to me, this film starts one story and then switches in mid-stream to a story stemming from a second, unrelated science fiction premise.<br /><br />While it was refreshing that the movie didn't just turn into a series of action sequences in which JGL tries to kill BW (which would have been a pretty one-sided conflict, admittedly) I found this shift in emphasis to be far more distracting than Joseph Gordon-Levitt's prosthetic nose. Which I never had a problem with.<br /><br />Anyway, I appear to be the only one bothered by this so just go ahead and enjoy the movie.
B004SIP9W4|5.0|I loved Richard Gere in this role and the time of life the main characters were in...I could identify at the time it came out  and wanted to own it.
B005K2YXHO|2.0|Amazon sent me the wrong product. They sent me a folding case for the kindle fire. I can sort of fit my paperwhite in it so I kept the case also the case was extremely cheap and not even worth the return shipping.<br /><br />However, this is not to say that the case is not quality. All Timbuk2 products I've owned always exceed my expectations. Just in this case it was for the wrong product.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I can't really be a good judge if this book. I read it off and on during a time of my midlife change and it wasnt till the end that i wnted to keep going but i have not bought the next one yet. Maybe fter the movie. better for younger people I guess.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show! It's about what would happen if the dead came back to life. There is a reason why its happening, which gives it some merit. The element of human nature doesn't change. Even with the threat of zombies trying to kill you at every turn, humans are still fighting and killing each other. I gave it 5 stars because the storyline is great, it has funny moments, tense moments and drama.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its just amazing good game the most played game I ever play its just like in the computer but a little different.
B000VLE3GA|4.0|This should be the ultimate music CD period but its not, I don't understand how they left off The Ocean, Living Loving Maid, What Is and Never Should Be, Hey Hey What Can I do, and Going To California. Shocking these are left off hence why I can't give it 5 stars
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is really an amazing book. I'm an avid runner, but this is a fascinating story for everyone to read. I learned so much about a culture and people I had never heard of.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|A nobody in Detroit is a big celebrity in South Africa.  What a great story!  I loved the music too!
B002A9VJ40|4.0|I still like to watch this movie. I'm not much of a Tom Cruise fan but this movie is a good one. One of those must see movies. It's coming out in 3D soon & I don't know if it's gonna help this movie much. All in all, good acting from some well know actors/actresses in the early parts of their careers.
B009B0L324|5.0|A must own for any AC/DC fan and considering they have never released a greatest hits, this CD is even better
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Lovely movie.  Uplifting and quirky.  You'll recognize someone you know and miss in one or more of these well wrought characters.  It made me want to call an old friend and tell 'em I loved them. :)
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like this game. I play it when playing on Pogo.com at home...It works the same on my kindle.. Thanks!
B00AR83PN4|3.0|It is addictive, but I have not gotten the hang of it as yet.  Harder than I expected, but challenging.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|some artifacting and dragging word word word word word word word word word word word this is the reason i dont do reviews
0143120530|2.0|I purchased this book, as did many before me, based on the previous reviews. I was intrigued with the topic, but was disappointed in how it was presented. I personally found the book boring in many chapters. His chapters on the history of memory etc. were worse than reading a text book. In fact I have read less boring text books. The flow within his chapters was confusing at times and I was forcing myself to get through them in hopes that it would get better. In fact there were times that I wanted to just stop reading the book altogether. His overall tone throughout the book, at least to me, was almost conceded in nature. In fact I was hoping that he lost the championships just due to his presented overall arrogance.<br /><br />Pros:  I gained some insight into the art of memory<br /><br />Cons:  Writing style/flow/attitude of the book
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was required reading for a book club and I probably would not have picked it out myself.  The club had a great discussion on this book and I would recommend it to any book clubs because of that.  The characters will definitely get your attention.  Good read
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I can't use any other work for this, but addictive.  No matter how hard I try, that darn timmer gets the best of me!
B00AHTYI5M|2.0|how this won Best Picture is beyond me! it must have been because it was a Ben Affleck and George Clooney movie. Clooney was not in the movie but i understand produced it. Of course he has not had a good movie for awhile. Nuff said. Do not buy it!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great stories, well acted and beautiful filming. We look forward to watching all the shows and are sad that the series ended after three seasons.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|use this at home too and it is very good, not had any problems with viruses on any PC or tablet, would recommend to my friends
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app so what if it is expensive I give it 5  stars great<br />Great app<br /> Ian
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved this book!!!  As always Mr. Sparks comes through with another amazing book!!!  Thank you for the best stories!! :) <3
B006HL9G10|4.0|I love the sounds that come with this app! The only thing I don't like is the Milestone feature - I feel that it gets in the way of just meditating, it turns into a goal to accomplish. I do like the connection feature, which allows you to connect with other meditators around the world. Overall it's a great app!
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|the grandkids love this, maybe because it remeinds them of each other, they often kid around that they are sleepwalking
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app was exactly what I wad looking for. Super easy to use and really fast. Great basic app for all to use. And I won't lose this calculator like every other one in the house!!
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My 4 year old loves this game. Its entertaining and keeps her busy on long car rides.  I plan on looking into other Dr. Panda games for her.
B00APUQKJK|4.0|I did not like the graphic sexual content, but Robert Pattinson is an outstanding (Oscar deserving) Actor.  This shows his range and depth.
B00683JK9K|5.0|great pictures, great levels, I played with 6 year old and he did great, then later I tried the harder ones with more pieces and it was even better
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have enjoyed reading some of Spark's other books and looked forward to reading this one. Loved the ending, very unexpected and romantic. I want to see the movie now even though from experience the book's always better.
B0054YIQLW|5.0|No wonder this version is the all-time favorite Carmen opera. It was shot on location and not inside a cramped theater. Both Placido Domingo and Julia Migenes are not only excellent opera singers, they are both also excellent thespians.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Love it, loved it and love it. This was such a wonderful movie on the need to listen and hear one another.
B007BT0RKG|3.0|It was not what I was expecting, I also didnt realize that each state had to be downloaded alone, I was happy that there was no cost when I downloaded it
B00992CF6W|5.0|dont pay 6$ wen u could get it free go to 4shared.com and get it free all u have to do is sign up type minecraft pe apk and click on the one u feel comfterbul with then download it and install enjoy ur free full version minecraft

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Enjoyed the book and the way it was explained.  The way he met his biological sister in Heaven whom he had never met before really made it for me.  Proof!!
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I installed this when I was having trouble accessing certain files on my Kindle Fire.  I also needed to download images direct from emails, which this is supposed to help with.  However, now it's in my Kindle and I have NO idea how to use it.  I consider myself fairly computer savvy, but can't figure this app out at all.  PLUS, it seems dangerous to use without the right knowledge -- I'm afraid of deleting or &#34;hiding&#34; any programs or files that I need.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|I really enjoy this app. I've never had any problems with it. The workouts are challenging but the timer makes it easier. The video helps maintain good form while the variations of exercises makes it go by quick as well. I highly recommend this app.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Fun, interesting characters.  Well developed plot. It is nice to read a book centered around two characters that can hold my attention so completely. I would like to read a continuation of this story.  It would make a good series.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed this Grisham book. Took some different twists and turns. Certainly held my interest. I would recommend it to others.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Excelente juguete recomendado calidad lego todo llego en perfectas condiciones, ideal para niños de 4 años  en adelante saludos desde venezuela
B0097BY3K6|5.0|very structured I listen every day. Even my grandson is wanting to listen to david garrett. thank you so much.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My Baby Girl sent this book to me. She said it was one that would stick with you; just like when I had her read \\"A child called it\\" when she was younger. She was right. This is a story I'll carry with me.
159420411X|5.0|This is easily one of the most interesting books I have read all year.<br /><br />Nate Silver has received a lot of attention lately for his predictions.  He has amazed the masses starting in 2002 when he developed the baseball sabermetric system PECOTA to the 2012 elections where he predicted correctly ever major result except two (North Dakota and Montana). He has this amazing ability to gather data, describe it clearly, and forecast accurately while remaining relevant , light-hearted, and downright funny at times.<br /><br />I could go over all the interesting details, facts, and anecdotes in the book, but nothing I can mention will do the book justice. I honestly wish this man was my statistics professor in college. I definitely would have considered a career in forecasting - would have been the only way I could work in the MLB.<br /><br />This book is a bit long but Silver is meticulous in his research and making sure his facts are clear and accurate. If you are not interested in the stock market, poker, chess, or weather then you can easily skip a chapter, however each chapter does build on the previous one.<br /><br />This is definite favorite for all nerds out there.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|normally i dont give bad reveiws but this is a time where i have to. IT COMPLETLY BROKE MY KINDLE FIRE!!! I had to talk to amazon to get it fixed all because when i turned on the game my kindle shut off. i charged it overnight cuz i thought that it might be cuz of battery...nope it still dosnt turn on. DON'T GET THIS APP
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Beautiful story with very good rhythm and appealing characters.<br />If you like adventure, do not hesitate to read it !
B008GAXUSK|5.0|For me, there's no shortage of magnificent Schubert symphonic cycles in period instrument renditions: Those conducted by Immerseel, Goodman and Bruggen come immediately to mind. Now I have another top choice in this category, bringing the total to four different sets all trying to share the pedestal. Marc Minkowski and Les Musiciens du Louvre Grenoble have recorded fine versions of Mozart's Symphonies Nos. 40 and 41 as well as Haydn's London Symphonies -- with a couple of seriously flawed moments in the latter -- and here they do about as fine a job with the Schubert symphonies as I can imagine, admitting that I can accept more than one viewpoint on these works. In the early symphonies, Nos. 1-6, Minkowski and his forces seem to me to adopt a attitude that is more Classical than Romantic, but there's a powerful Beethoven-like spine that stiffens each of them accordingly. Hefty and strong, these performances nonetheless never bog down and maintain a sinewy litheness. The two mature works -- the Nos. 8 and 9 -- are still dressed more in Classical style, but with Romantic accessorizing, perhaps. Both have power but are never allowed to bloat to monumental size. The second movement of the Unfinished has some bite in its louder sections, indeed. \\"Bite\\" is also a word I'd apply to the rendition of the No. 9 -- this one really reaches out to you, rather than sitting there wanting to be contemplated. This is a great Schubert cycle from start to finish and who knows, maybe someday it will finally outlast those other three to become my number one. It's certainly in the running.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Loved P.P. from the auditions on, on American Idol, thrilled when he won, thrilled to hear his first cd.  The much played \\"Home\\" isn't annoying when listening to the cd's progression.  Some very emotionally packed lyrics.  Beautiful acoustics.
B008J05EL8|5.0|Need extra fonts for your Kindle Fire HD tablet OfficeSuite program? Then download this app and have more than enough fonts than you will ever need. I don't use the app a lot, but when I do, it's nice to have a choice of fonts to write something with.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Great for your memory.  It's the game memory on steroids. So far my fastest time is x5.22..lol I thought I was doing pretty good until I saw the high scores lol can u believe some1 beat it in 4 seconds lol that's frikin rain man lol I wish I could do that :)
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I adore it!  I bought it on Prime, but for some reason it disappeared after a couple of weeks so I had to buy the DVD.  I think I'll always buy the DVDs now because you guys don't deliver on the streaming .  I paid $9.99 but could not get the movie online on Prime.  Anyway I loved everything about this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0865478007|4.0|I think that we all know too little about what goes on the world of the pharmaceutical industry and if we were better informed maybe we would look at our doctor and what he prescribes us with very different eyes! We still want to believe that the world is, if not perfect quite good and that no one would hurt us on purpose and surely not only in order to make money but well.... The truth is that we live in a capitalist society where profits go above everything else and yes... people do hurt us, if not on purpose at least knowingly, others hurt us because they don't really care about anything else but they own financial well being, etc. We are now responsible for our own health and think otherwise is put ourselves and our families in danger! Either we want to get informed and try to protect ourselves as well as we possibly can, either we don't and then we are responsible for what happens to us. We can't wait for strangers to take the responsibility! The era of the nice village doctor who really cared if gone maybe forever! Now you have people who will make a lot of money because of the fact that you are ill, a lot more than if you were healthy and trying to keep you healthy is not an option for them. Sometimes making you more ill it is! Ben Goldacre is a doctor and therefore is somehow biased on some subjects but he is not afraid to say what he thinks and to dig till he gets a lot of dirt out. A dangerous business if you ask me.... But well, he is not afraid to do it!<br /><br />As I said I don't agree with everything he says. His distrust of homeopathy is shared by many within the allopathic establishment and I am sure that there are some quacks around in the natural medicine, of course there are, but there are a lot of good therapies as well! I have had very good results with homeopathy, even with my children when they were tiny and saw them get better when allopathic medicine had no idea how to treat them so, anybody who tells me that it is all rubbish needs maybeto think again. He is also against vitamins and minerals. Of course this market has also been taken over by Big Pharma big time and no one can stop that! I have just noticed that the vitamins I am taking at this moment are manufactured by Merck, not good news..... but to say that anyone who advises patients to take vitamins and minerals are quacks.... Well, that is showing very little knowledge on the subject! Maybe Dr. Goldacre would like to read a bit about Linus Pauling?<br /><br />That said.... What goes on in the pharmaceutical world is bordering criminal and the amount of money they often pay to settle cases shows exactly that. Ben Goldacre also gives suggestions of how this all could be changed but I don't hold my breath.... It won't change any time soon! The book can get a bit repetitive at times but all in all is very much worth reading! Read it and then make up your mind, don't read it and you might regret it!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|If you are like me, you use your Amazon Fire Tablet a lot. Always have a secondary USB cable and Quick Charger handy for when you travel. I can't live without them and the price is right. You don't feel ripped-off when you purchase these items because they are guaranteed by Amazon.
0439023521|5.0|The plot is intriguing, the characters are extraordinary yet still relatable and the storyline is the perfect combination of disturbing and uplifting. Collins writes with just the right amount of detail that allows readers to picture themselves in the story but those details never weigh down or overshadow the message of the story. I thought the character development was a bit lacking (with the exception of the Katniss). Overall I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it for sure.<br />The Hunger Games is the best book I've read in a while.
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|I love Cher!!!!!!  I don't care if she's had 500 surgeries.  She's still 67 and absolutely gorgeous! I love her.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I love this app/game very very funk would recommend this app OK so this is the most fun app ever.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I cannot get enough...even the scenes from World War I make you feel like you are there.<br />I recommend it highly!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Brilliant game which keeps you engaged, controls are surprisingly easy and graphics are good. Gives you wrist ache after a while but well worth it.
0784011710|5.0|Great movie...the DVD has no skips...sounds great, too...the plot of this movie is powerful...and sad...but I think we need to be reminded about that many people suffered from the Holocaust....we don't want to ever forget....
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Can't give a complete review just yet. I've only been playing this game for a limited time. So far it's ok.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Normally I don't write a review until I finish a novel, but this one is so good, I can't wait to talk about it. I'm starting Part Six tonight. It might go faster if I didn't keep pausing the Kindle to flag great, memorable lines. BONUS: I learned today that other readers have been doing the same thing, and I can share right on the amazon page all the great quotes I love from this novel. For all the people who hate amazon, how do you beat a feature like this? I love it! Now I just have to figure out how to get my excerpts posted here with everyone else's. Some of the more memorable lines get posted repeatedly, especially the line about how a gun allows us to kill faster than we can think about the consequences.<br /><br />Hugh Howey. Age 37. Not even an English major, but a mechanic? He read his Shakespeare, and it shows. Not in wordy prose. No, the prose is clean and easy to read, yet rich with metaphors and fresh, vivid imagery.<br /><br />At first I was prepared to believe the one-star reviews, but \\"boring\\" often means the writing is literary, and \\"too many stairs\\" was a line I just had to check out. Coincidentally, a woman my age said her secret to weight loss was running up and down the stairs every hour, and I had just started that when WOOL came to my attention, and the first review I saw complained about stairs. That sold me right there.<br /><br />Those one-star bandits are wrong. This novel didn't get all those 5-star ratings because some novice author got a bunch of friends, family and strangers to slap five stars on it to boost sales. Nope. This is the real McCoy. That rare find, a great novel amid all the amazon e-books self-pubbed by wannabes.<br /><br />The concept is incredible: as farmers in ancient times preserved seeds in silos, so a future society decided to put humans, like seeds, into an underground silo. For how many generations? Until the toxic wasteland above ground is finally fit for human habitat. We don't know how the surface of the earth became so toxic, and people in the silo no longer know anything about a world outside the silo.<br /><br />Not until the 50% point did this critical metaphor come to light. I don't care if it's a plot spoiler -- it's a #1 selling point of the novel, I think: Humans as seeds, kept underground for years, centuries, if necessary. It's a lot of work, keeping them alive -- burying the old, raising the new -- and keeping the secret of what's above ground, and what kind of human society existed before.<br /><br />At first, I was thinking \\"Eh, just another thriller. The elite few at the top hold secrets. They deceive the people. They rewrote history. Now someone is gradually uncovering the cover-up. What an over-done idea.\\"<br /><br />But the characters make the story come alive. It's not often I find a novel that I can't put down. This one took off a little bit slowly, and yes, there have been lots of stairs, but the prose is wonderful. It isn't merely competent and well edited. It's GREAT prose!<br /><br />And Juliette, the heroine, is a mechanic, and the author's own mechanical skills give Juliette authenticity. She starts her career in the \\"down deep,\\" a grease monkey, a tough, gritty, strong woman, and her cleverness, her survival instincts, keep us enthralled. There's a scene where she ends up in a new place, naked as a newborn.... Hugh Howey taps deep into the archetypes. This novel ranks right up there with The Hunger Games.<br /><br />There's more, so much more, to say, but I'm saving it up for a review at Perihelion (Sam Bellotto's online magazine for science fiction lovers). Note: Sam is also here at goodreads with his own novel, Yellow Glad Days.<br /><br />Now, to get done reading it....so many pages.... so many characters get killed.... it's heart breaking.<br /><br />Ridley Scott, the same guy who produced \\"Alien\\", \\"BladeRunner\\" and other movies, optioned rights to the film version of Wool. A TV series would be great, too, but I'll take whatever comes along.Talent like Hugh Howey's is all too rare.<br /><br />Note: My name is Carol, not Candy. About time I update my amazon profile.Talent like Hugh Howey's is all too rare.<br /><br />Note: My name is Carol, not Candy. About time I update my amazon profile.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I think I'm hooked on Maggie. Oh my goodness, I read the Scorpio races and the raven boys, but the wolves of mercy falls will be the savior to me.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Game is fun but I think the pricing of items in game are way to much. Guess it is like all games, they want money from you for everything, so they want you to purchase extra coins energy,etc.
B008VVT51U|5.0|I love Location movies, and this one is really good. They do not make movies like this, if you are tired of the same ole same ole pretty girl beefy guy, cheeky movies, try this, it's worth your time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such an amazing story. I couldn't put it down. Got my tears, smiles and crazy emotions. Great, great read!!! Would suggest to anyone of all ages.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I live in Hot Springs Arkansas and I know all the places Adam talks about in the book. He is very inspirational. I think his story is one of a kind and something everybody should read.
B00BLGZDVS|2.0|Intriguing performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix, and typically inventive direction from Paul Thomas Anderson.<br /><br />But, overall the film is slow, messy and overrated.
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|Such a GOOD Movie! I highly recommend this.  This deserves more than 5 stars.  Helen Hunt is great, and William H. Macy, there are no words! LOL.....Watch it, BUY it.
B0086700CM|3.0|It works great since I downloaded it from my Polaroid. Never had a glitch problem from this app. Process of getting this app was also simple.
B004V71CYQ|5.0|I always have been a fan of Tron, and I'm proud to say I'll all ways will! At first watching the trailer I was suspicious that the graphics would make it hard for me to follow along, because unlike Tron:Legacy and Uprising, well its an obvious difference. I am proud to say, that I believe I love this one equally as much.<br />A much watch for all Tron fans!
1400031524|4.0|This story is a dark and suspenseful mystery.<br /><br />Not your run-of-the-mill crime drama, this story includes international crime and criminals involved in dangerous and deadly pursuits in which Inspector Kurt Wallander finds himself literally in the middle of. Though the story and related characters are very interesting, it seemed another, creative way to delve further into understanding Wallander himself. This is the second Wallander novel I've read, and for me, the basic combination of a meticulously-thorough, creative, and highly organized criminal investigator - while also an awkward, insecure, and sensitive man - is what is most compelling and what stays on my mind after finishing the novels.
B001ECQ6E2|5.0|A classic romance.<br /><br />The book is worlds better of course, but that is to be expected. They did a great job on the movie version.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Held me captivated from beginning to end. That is the absolute workings of a fantastic story. There were times I could feel my heart absolutely pounding in response to what in was reading...that's when you know it  good.
B004GFN11A|5.0|I love this app. I actually use the the app more than the website on my laptop, because it is so much easier to use.<br />for those who still don't understand how to use WP fully.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|I just started viewing the movie with my 3 year-old son, and one of the characters just ripped the heart out of a zombie.  I'm glad he had his back turned during that scene.  It looks like a pretty good movie, but I'm guessing this scene is one of the reasons it has a PG rating.<br /><br />If my 4 year-old daughter had watched that scene, I would have faced questions like, \\"Why did that man rip the heart out of that other man?\\"  And, \\"Why is that man still alive if his heart was ripped out?\\"<br /><br />It looks like a pretty good movie, but I just can't show it to my kids just yet.<br /><br />Hopefully, I can get my money back.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great application for following all the passages of scripture in a easy to follow way.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo was engaging, suspenseful, and at times quite funny. Ben Afflec and Alan Arkin gave award winning performances in my opinion. We would watch it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow I can not believe my best friend got me sucked in to this game now i am obsessed I need the Rome character here me I NEED him ok I over exaggerated but I can't stop playing seriously normally I play games for five minutes and I quit what has it done to me I love it best game ever
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best shows on television.  The acting is superb.  You can't help but love all the characters and even the ones you hate you still love.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|As an anti-war person from waaay back, this book gave me an entirely new way of looking at war.  These men were just trying to stay alive and keep their friends alive....will read this one again!
B003TTKB5I|4.0|I just started watching this series in the last few weeks. I have no idea why I didn't watch it earlier. But then again the show on Prime is only 40 minutes long. A plus. Well written, good acting. A must watch.

159514188X|3.0|To start with - I borrowed the kindle edition of this book from my local library. I don't think I would have been happy paying $9 for it.<br /><br />The message is a good one - small actions and words can have a lasting effect on a person, and even petty comments that seem harmless at the time could be the final straw for a person with nothing left. Considering the national attention that the bullying epidemic in America is currently receiving, it seems a fitting novel for the times.<br /><br />That being said, I did not enjoy this book all that much. At times the author really did a great job capturing the mind and heart of a depressed teenager, but in between that the subject of the novel came across as being, well, kind of petty and melodramatic. It made me wonder if the author wanted the readers to sympathize with the subject.<br /><br />Also I was bothered by the introduction of some seemingly random characters/settings that really didn't add to the storyline. The old man in the liquor store? I didn't understand his contribution to the story.<br /><br />Is it worth reading? Maybe. If you are into \\"social consciousness\\" kind of works, sure. It wasn't unreadable. I just didn't really like the portrayal of the subject, at times.<br /><br />So to sum up - great message, good story about the effects of our harsh words on others, I personally didn't like the tone of the book at times/there was extraneous stuff that seemed to serve no purpose.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Love Denzel Washington.  Movie was so real and how do we know as travelers some of this has not happened.  Keep it up.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|Decades-old and counting, the laughs and comic scenes have yet to age a day. Highly recommended after a stressful day at work to realize life is about enjoying the journey, not winning a rat race.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved the whole story and especially loved the ending.  He is a great writer and<br />always holds my attention with his stories.  I recommend it to anyone who like a<br />sweet love story.
B005DN7W4G|5.0|I'm not going to mention anything about the plot or the special effects, both are just fine for this kind of movie.<br /><br />What I didn't expect the movie would do is make me appreciate the current state of politics and policy in this country (USA). All the things going on right now, including DHS ammo stockpiling, the evisceration of the constitution and our civil liberties, the enormous expansion of the FedGov leviathan, all can be explained if one assumes the FedGov knows something that the rest of us don't. The presumption being \\"that something\\" is a horrible upcoming event which will indeed happen to this nation, possibly this planet, necessitating the removal of our personal liberties.<br /><br />So maybe all the terrible things FedGov is doing right now is in preparation for that event. If that's the case then I forgive you, FedGov.<br /><br />If it's not the case then screw you and I hope you go down in flames because you have destroyed the most perfect nation on earth.<br /><br />I'm glad Deep Impact opened up my eyes to this possibility!
1401307957|5.0|I've given this book to people who are in need of inspiration.  Especially those who feel they can not draw or create a picture with a pen or pencil.  Since drawing is a learned art this book helps those who have little confidence to just pick up a drawing tool and GO FOR IT!  I highly recommend this book for any age.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book will bring you closer together and have a better understanding of each other! I highly recommend it to everyone who is married and want their marriage to be better. (even if it is already good)
B0065GC0BA|5.0|What a wonderful writer.  I cried my eyes out but enjoyed every word.  It opened my eyes to a person with disabilities and how to respond to them.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Excellent two seasons of this fabulous show. I am so happy to have them so I can watch them over & over. The setting & costumes are just like it would have been in that era. The people cast just fit the bill to a tee. I don't think anyone does period pieces like the British. The people cast just seem to wear the costumes & look like they were from that era. Not modern types put in clothes. Excellent Masterpiece Theater series once again. The show is so addicting. If you haven't seen it, you don't know what you're missing.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Very solid book.  I cannot wait to read the other books in this series!  Highly recommended even if the end can be deducted!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|but I would expect nothing less from the best show on TV. There's a reason the show has been on for 10 years!!!!!
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Reminded me of how important American rock music was to the changes in Central and Eastern Europe during the fall of the Berlin Wall -- especially but not exclusively to Vaclav Havel in the then Czechoslovakia.  And, of course Sugarman himself is a hugely compelling figure, beautifully captured in the film.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book, as Victor Hugo said, provides a mirror for all humankind.  It is a picture of the best and the worst of us. Great literature and great read.
B00B23O96A|4.0|Eric Clapton has gotten to the point in his life where he can make music he likes. I see people slamming this record because it's not Cream era Clapton or Blues Breaker Clapton ect ect. It seems like if he had done a record that sounded like some older Clapton people would be slamming him for making the same old music over and over. Just enjoy the music and be thankful that he is still putting out music.
B007M45PMU|2.0|Quite a few slow songs. I can't really tell the different between the lumineers and Mumford and sons. I like the cd, just not one of my top 20.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I could not put the book down. It doesn't end how you expect it to. I don't read that often but did not have a hard time finishing it.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Apatow's a genius who views the world through a familial lens, finding the humor in each situation without ever losing sight of the love. Paul Rudd & Leslie Mann are spectacular together. Supporting actors were awesome. This movie addresses 40 something issues in such an enlightened way that we were still laughing days later. Bravo. Keep 'em coming.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book was great. Obviously you get to know the characters more...but the story line was better. Def read the book!
1849025975|5.0|Orwell's perspective on the Spanish Civil War was impressively told from his own lived experiences,not as a reporter,because to do so would have ended up with a manufactured account,a story full of lies as was common in the world's press. Joining the militia to fight the fascists `seemed the only conceivable thing to do'.To take up arms with an anarchist outfit the POUM,was to work out the factionalism from the inside,to discover through his own painful honesty the lies,propaganda and deceit that was eating out the revolutionary socialism from within.Orwell served only about 4 months on the Aragon and Teruel fronts.He admits to being afraid,he never avoided the dangers to life,he perceives his surroundings with vibrant clarity and sharpness.He describes the conditions,the boredom, the occasional excitement of patrols and attacks,the filth and the cold.What he remembers with most warmth is the unique sense of comradeship and equality which he experienced in those early months of fighting on the government side.Orwell was in permanent exile from his society dropping out with the down and outs in Paris and London, describing the poverty of the north of England in Wigan Pier.He'd dropped into the only community where ruled and rulers didn't exist,where he could mingle without any sense of caste,with men of every origin,all living at the same level,a foretaste of socialism that had a `magic quality.'<br /><br />His rejection of the ways of his background and the imperial hierarchies of the class-system was ratified by the principle of socialism.Homage to Catalonia is a moving book because it is the most deliberate attempt he ever made to become part of a believing community.Socialism was the fight against fascism,imperialism,inequality.His 1st view of Barcelona in December 1936,a city of resurgent anarchism with the working class firmly in the saddle.\\"in some ways I did not like it,but I recognised immediately it was a state of affairs worth fighting for.\\"His return there a few months later is to see the bourgeoisie and the wealthy back in prominence.Orwell is appalled at the chaos, inefficiency,the lack of food and arms on the Republican side,having had experience as a military policeman in Burma.Orwell saw the POUM fight the war on the basis of revolution.He loves the Spanish with their innate decency and anarchist tinge.Some of them are as young as 16.<br /><br />As this was the prelude to WWII,world-power politics had moved onto the Iberian Peninsula.A number of forces combined against the revolutionary Catalonians.Russia,the only source of arms for the Republican side,moved towards a position of power:Stalinism assumed an anti-revolutionary line, which appealed to the propertied classes.A reconstructed caste system saw the formation of an officer corps,the consolidation of the Communist Party and its police into a ruling elite. POUM Marxists were vilified by the Communists and persecuted.HC takes on a darker tone as he describes the internecine war in Barcelona,when he stood guard on the roof of a cinema above the barricaded streets in May 1937,the Communists and police on one side ,the Anarchists and POUM on the other.POUM is suppressed, its members and supporters hunted down.'It was an insane existence...by night we were criminals,but by day we were prosperous English visitors'.The irony is Orwell had initially supported the Communist line for the greater unity and efficiency.Now POUM had been branded as Trotskyists and fascists.Despite disillusion,Orwell became a democratic socialist,condemning official communist policy and foreign reporting of the Spanish struggle.He puts the case of the common man so well.Witness his vivid description of a bullet wound in the neck.<br /><br />I like this novel as well as Coming Up For Air best of all his novels,for its humour,common sense,humanity, idealism,precision,attack against ideologies,shared hardship,objectivity(he sees the world as suffering a mental disease of which he is the doctor).He contemplates England in both books in the shadow of the coming war,in both there is a moving coda to an England of the heart.Both prefigure Animal Farm,a fable satirising revolution and dictatorship,and 1984,a grim picture of a future authoritarian world,a boot treading into a human face forever. Communism replaces Fascism as the future enemy.

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This app is easily played once you figure out how to tell the tiles apart; before that it's a little difficult.  I like that only the tiles that are accessible show up; the others are &#34;hidden&#34; from sight so you don't waste time trying to find accessible tiles.  But like I said, before you can tell them apart, the pairs are difficult to find.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|I wasn't too sure what I was getting  into when choosing this book. It was a fast read, as well as a good one. I didn't quite understand the connection between Pat and Tiffany, I was taken back at how she had this love for Pat when the description of their relationship was vague. I guess it's understandable since the book IS written from Pats point of view. Eager to see the movie now :)

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this is totally worth it. I can not believe it's free! I love it so so much! the graphics are nice and it's almost kinda cartoonish. SO addicting.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|If you are/were a fan of X-Files or similar shows you will like this one. I find the character development here to be really strong and the underlying story line continues from show to show - not in the same way that Breaking Bad does it - but it is even enough to keep you guessing and watching and enjoying. The lady who plays the lead agent seems to defy the standard female lead stereotypes which I really like. Most TV/Movies tend to rely on really simplistic, tired views of female characters and this show doesn't do that happily.    The lead female villain is an interesting character too. She clearly shows elements of classic evil in the [...] sense but then seems to reveal her struggling humanity by helping Agent Dunham now and then too (DON'T TRUST HER Olvia!). The rest of the supporting characters are all wonderfully flawed in different ways so they are not all portrayed as flat background color to the main characters. You get to see their struggles and watch them learn and grow and overcome.    The only negative I would give to the show is the sheer implausibility of some of the circumstances in which things occur. Ignoring the tenuous nature of various episodes, when you are watching the show you will note times when you'll clearly say to yourself - \\"There's no freaking way that could happen like that...\\". However, this has never detracted from my enjoyment of the show or the suspense and apprehension that the show builds up for me.    It took me a couple of episodes to get into the groove of this story but now I find myself actively cheering when one of the bad guys meets a particularly sinister end. (And they do get it - whoo boy!).    Overall, I really enjoy this show and if you can overlook some of the contrivances you will too.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Great for parents and children. There's plenty of colors, action, and fun things to keep kids entertained. Also, there's plenty of adult humor and references to older games.I recommend this for any parent or fan of animated films.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors and this book was one of the greatest that combines mystery, love and a happy ending!  Would recommend this book to everyone.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Just so very, very good and entertaining. I've paid to see these seasons and then I get to the fifth season and I have to pay MORE on top of that! I haven't figured the whole thing out but it would cost me around $60 to view the whole season! I don't think that's right. You should have some sort of disclaimer, at the very least, at the beginning that states further down the line you will have to pay for the later seasons. This happened in October Road too. Well that one you can't even see online, you HAVE to buy the DVD!!<br /><br />You should also have a rating for these TV shows. Those British shows show full frontal nudity and have the most awful language it would make a sailor blush. I just never dreamed it was that bad over there. I suppose in time it will be the same here so there needs to be some sort of filtering system. Please. Thank you.

B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl had a life that by most people's  standards was unconventional before choosing to hike the Pacific Crest Trail. This story of her physical and emotional journey to sort out her life following the death of her mother is both painful and inspiring -- much like the trail itself.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Unfortunately this is not the best G5 game.  It is often times difficult to find the object because it's too dark or it's hiding behind the menu at the bottom of the screen.  This required zoom so you can move the screen.  The adventure is simple, find the object(s) go back a screen or two, use the object(s), solve<br />a puzzle, repeat. It is more hidden object then adventure.  Short but OK.

B006YZHEB8|5.0|Grab a box of tissues, a snack, and sit back to watch a movie that'll change your life in my opinion, so much that you'll never be the same. Courageous is the story of four policemen who are also after a time, four brothers in the Lord. The Police scenes are all very realistic (and I am one who once spent a lot of time around a police station working where I did.) and some scenes will have you hanging on to your seat! There are happy moments, very sad moments (thus the tissues!), lots of drama both as Policemen in uniform and at home with their families. Along the way, a 'handy man' named Harvee' becomes \\"adopted by their group\\" as character Adam Mitchell played by Alex Kendrick, one of the movie's writers, put it, after being hired to help Adam (Kendrick) build a garage as he is praying for work and Adam is actually waiting for a handyman referred to him by his fellow officer/best friend Shane - named Harvey! A VERY funny scene where Harvey is working on the garage when the guys are out for lunch and Shane reveals that his friend Harvey is in the hospital! Same name - different Harvey, another funny scene that goes into the saddest scene of the film. (which I won't give away)  After the mix up though, they become good friends and Harvey begins a full time job that Adam referred him for and the test given him is one given to many in real life, yet as the actors say, few can seem to pass it. You find yourself cheering Harvey's character on throughout the movie for his job searching, deep faith, and his portrayl of one the \\"Street Kings.\\" (prepare for a laugh until you cry moment!) Personally,that's one of my favorite scenes! Many poignant family moments combined with police on the job action and a main storyline woven in as smoothly as silk with a message so powerful about fathers and family that your own life may be changed in that area. Many scenes in this movie softens hearts and for me anyway, gave me the desire to be the best woman/Christian/wife/mother I can possibly be. I've seen amazing changes in my husband, and that's seldom seen just from seeing a movie but - the message of being the BEST father and husband that leads his home by the Word of God Courageous is SO very powerful and makes you feel every emotion you possibly feel. Whether Christian or not, I HIGHLY recommend Courageous. My husband and I watch our copy at least twice a week, it's THAT good. Best news is, it has so many powerful scenes that while watching with several non-Christians, two gave their lives to Christ after seeing it with us! Whether a couple in their 50s with children and grandchildren like us, or a Church group - young or old, I just cannot recommend Couragous more! I PRAY that the Kendrick brothers actually read these reviews, as we would LOVE to see MANY MORE movies written/made by them. Lots of talent, both in storylines and in acting. Actors & actresses chosen completely fit the parts and this also is the same with their other films: their first, Flywheel, also Facing the Giants (watching as I type this!) and Fireproof. ALL wonderful in their own ways. We HAD to own them all! You'll NOT be sorry viewing and purchasing this gem, whether Christian or non. Thank you, Kendrick brothers, for wonderful family entertainment - Christian or non - [[ASIN:B006P96PAO Courageous]] with a message that touches hearts and leaves us craving much more!  A MUST SEE! For us, 5 stars isn't enough, it's THAT good! Many fathers, especially Christian fathers, will have a difficult time remaining seated in the final scene, when Adam is speaking at church about dads and their being Godly and Courageous dads, husbands, and men during the call for such dads who are among those the most courageous for God and family.<br /><br />By the way -- ALL the actors are members of a Sherwood Church in Albany,Georgia. I think that's AMAZING! (I pray that the town is correct - I forget the denomination of the church, but all the actors are members of that church, also all theirmovies are made with ONE camera - this is info from one of the extras parts of the DVD - and to me that's far MORE than just another amazing blessing!)
B003G4W49C|5.0|About the story, not much to say that hasn't already been said.<br />Personally I had heard of this book for a long time, but never mustered the desire to read it. Decided on a sci-fi-whim to give it a whirl one evening, bought it, downloaded it, and then found myself making excuses for work the day after, since I didn't go to sleep till I was done reading it at about 5AM.<br />A striking story, which doesn't feel dated at all.<br />By the way, after reading this book and understanding the hype around it and its sequels, I finally understood Donald Westlake's humurous put-down in &#34;Money for nothing&#34;.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Even thought the actor playing Mr Rodchester is too good looking<br />he does it very well and they are good together<br />I have 5 different Jane Eyer movies and this one is number one
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I thought the movie was more realistic than the 1995 version with Sylvester Stallone.  I liked the plotline and was left open for a sequel.  I did feel as though Dredd was more a secondary character at times because of the rookie.  What did irritate m e were the slomo scenes as I felt they over did it just a tad.  Overall good action flick.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|If you're looking for a cute romance that is a quick read--this is for you!<br />Kept me interested and a had a nice pace.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|I love Tommy Lee Jones.  I( had a hard time following why he was talking to a Ghost of a Civil war general.  The movie didn't stick with me.
B000784WMW|3.0|Timothy Dalton was way to good looking to play this part but that being said he did a<br />ok joy of it
1594744769|4.0|Freaky, was the first word that came to my mind when I first saw the cover of this book, but I had to admit it caught my attention.  From the picture, many may expect a horror book, but it wasn't.  It was a story about a boy looking for answers about his grandfather and himself.  The story itself was full of action and kept me riveted, but the pictures were the icing on the cake, so to speak.  They added an extra element to the story, and they were fascinating to look at.  As a teacher, I believe this is a good book for reluctant readers, and I thoroughly enjoyed it as an adult reader, as well.  I am anxiously awaiting the next book to come out.[...]
B005LAIIKI|3.0|I've watched this movie 3 times.Why???Because I watch a lot of movies and sometimes I just don't get it.This is one I just don't get.Its not that it isn't enjoyable on a certain level but academy award;YIKES!!!!!The performances are generally good for what they are but the plot is ludicrous and the dialog boring and bordering on just plain stupid.Lots of violence but stupid hollywood violence not the real thing (see Killing Them Softly).I loved Pulp Fiction but that was a long time ago and everything since reeks of mediocrity.2 or 3 stars max  de
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|******SPOILER ALERT***** Buy this, rent this, stream this, it is magic with costumes, great actors, scenery, history, I am in love with Downton Abbey and will watch anything and everything about this. There is nothing more fun than watching Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess steal a scene.  Even with the death of Sybil and Matthew and the leaving of O'Brien, I feel it will be exciting to meet new characters and enjoy getting to know them.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|They were not so good together just OK<br />I don't have any thing else to say about this movie<br />except that its a nice way to spent an afternoon
0385344333|5.0|First, I will admit that I am a big Lee Child and Jack Reacher fan.  The character is one of the best characters in modern literature, and Lee Child doesn't disappoint in his book A Wanted Man.  Like in all of the Jack Reacher novels, Reacher once again finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when he hitches a ride with the wrong people.  The best part of this book and in any Reacher book is how he bluntly deals with the bad guys.  The only thing I wish is for someone to fix poor Reacher's nose.  With Lee Child's vivid descriptions, it hurts to read about it.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a great action packed story with a good guy who doesn't hesitate to do the dirty work that needs to be done.[[[...]]]
B003YFIUW8|5.0|WOW! This is so well written that I don't know what to say, except &#34;Thank you!&#34; to the clerk at Borders who recommended it to me a couple of years ago. I wish I had read it sooner.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I had never heard of this movie until I saw it on a trailer and notice Maggie Smith was in it.  I will watch anything Maggie Smith does. So I ordered the DVD.  I LOVED this movie and will watch it again and again.  It has the very best of British actors.  I will tell you nothing of the story except to say it is something that many of us will probably face sometime in the future in some way.  It is sweet, tragic, funny, and loving.  Take some time out and watch it.  You will be happy that you did.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|First few episodes were a little less interesting but by the last I was hooked! Now I can't wait to watch
141659521X|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Mitch Rapp series, and the newest one, The Last Man, is probably one of the best ones.  Not only does it have the action and intrigue of all of the other books, but Vince Flynn also continues to develop the character of Mitch Rapp.  I enjoy seeing the growth and changes in his character as the series progresses.  I can't wait for the next book to come out because Vince Flynn doesn't disappoint.[...]
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Had to skip a lot of parts as author describes over and over again about the past ...not as good as the first.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|Love the series, but I could not enjoy it.  Download rarely works, and when it finally does, it is not in the HD format that I ordered.  I have downloaded movies from other companies and they download and view fine.  I am so disappointed and feel I have wasted $20 I could have used to put toward the purchase of the CDs.<br />You really failed me this time, Amazon.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I really didn't think I would enjoy Downton Abbey but since it was so popular I decided to watch it on  Prime streaming video and was pleasantly surprised.  I thought season 1 was a little more interesting but I enjoyed both of them.
074322454X|5.0|This is a great book that was well made with the author painting a picture of the setting while having commentary from the soldiers that were there. Ambrose does a wonderful job of blending the two to make it seem like an action flick in your head while explaining the tactical layout. even if this book was 50 dollars it still would be worth every cent. Enjoy the series? The book is way better primarily because its more detailed and accurate(very complete down to the minimalist detail while still being fascinating for war buffs, because instead of watching it you feel you are living it, good and bad with the men of E company)  MUST BUY FOR WAR BUFFS AND FANS OF THE &#34;SCREAMING EAGLES&#34;
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful. I loved the fact that the estate was saved for this production. I appreciated the historic sequence. Great job!
B000P0J024|5.0|Great music and the DVD is a good story about the writing and recording of Vol 1.  Miss you Roy, but we have your music ......
B0002NRQTS|1.0|Why did they even bother? Rupert Hine simply ruined this disc. It's a shame too because it has some really great songs on it. The production is so thin, treble, high, crisp, bright... Alex's guitar is ANYTHING BUT beefy, the snare sounds like a cap gun and THERE'S NO BALLS. Sorry I wasted the money on a remaster, this thing needed reworking from the mixing stage, the remaster process did absolutely nothing. Rush & co wasted their money here.
B004LROUNG|3.0|Interesting; until about the middle of the novel.  Things are not moving fast enough and one tends to get bored.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series has been as one that I wouldn't have dreamed of missing even one episode. I can't wait for season 4 to premier. Thank you UK!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A little slow at times but overall a great movie, a great story and very well done!! Overall I Recommend it!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was very good. I couldn't put it down. Much better than the movie. The movie didn't follow the book close enough. I really like the way Nicholas sparks made Jos character
0812993292|4.0|Although it is noted to be light reading, this first novel may encourage the reader to some soul searching of one's own.  A good read, and kudos for a first novel.  Hope it is not the last.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Surely the greatest fictional hero. Kindle just makes the great man available worldwide and light to carry.Please publish the complete collection.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is a spellbinding and timeless movie. Terrific story and great acting. Entertaining for all adults. Not for young children
B00AMBH70S|3.0|For me it was just OK, it didn't seem like a Bourne movie without Matt Damon. The plot was OK in keeping with the other movies but it just didn't flow for me.
B00A4AI17A|4.0|I haven't listened to all of them yet, but based on the casts, they should be pretty good.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that, like any opera recordings, there are some good singers in any production, and some that make the listener cringe.  You might find individual performances that you like better, but to have every Verdi opera at your fingertips is a pleasure.  And EMI recordings are not shabby, regardless of their age.  I would suggest that you buy this box, and when you find an opera that you don't care for, you can look for a better performance.  If you don't find one, at least you'll have a recording that contains some pleasing singers.  Use this set as your basis for comparisons.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this story.  The several twists and surprises.  I'm not sure I liked the ending.  I thought it was creative how the story is told in the present from the husbands perspective and at the same time in the past from the wife's diary.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|.<br />WOW!  A real VISUAL FEAST.  Incredible talent and imagination. (This starts a bit slow but hang in there, you get used to the pace and it's a great show.) I always wanted to see a live performance in Vegas but it's pretty pricey for me and will probably never happen - so I was THRILLED to have the opportunity to see them perform in this movie.  I was not disappointed at all!<br /><br />The acrobatics, the skill, the choreography, the fantastic sets etc. are about impossible NOT to appreciate.  The acrobatics, by the way, are somewhat creepy at times but even still you just can't help but appreciate the incredible control and talent of these artists - it's fantastic, sometimes sensual and perhaps erotic (but G rated so it's ok for the kids to watch)<br /><br />I believe you have to think of this movie like watching a weird dream - a circus kind of dream. And, you don't have to \\"understand\\" it to appreciate it.  Just enjoy the show, the costumes, the talent, the cool sets, the pure fantasy of it all.<br /><br />There IS a loose \\"story\\" of sorts to this dialogue-free show...  A young girl goes to a circus and is watching an aerialist IN WHITE PANTS who falls (30+ feet?) to the sand of the circus ring floor which collapses to suck him in (like falling into the sand in the top part of an hour-glass).  She rushes from the audience seats to help him when he falls and gets sucked in too - into another circus type world/dimension.  Turns out he's been \\"captured\\".  She see's many cool circus acts in this new place as she looks for him.  And there is a \\"battle\\" of sorts (all on visible wires, but it doesn't matter that you can see the wires because it's just cool to watch and you can't help but appreciate the precision of choreography and all to keep that many wires from getting crossed/tangled while they do all this, and - small spoiler:  the captured (WHITE PANTS) aerialist is freed.  Once freed, he goes wandering around and like the girl, he also sees some incredible things.<br /><br />About 3/5 of the way through, the WHITE PANTS aerialist and the girl almost find each other but are kept apart.  The girl seems to walk out of the circus tent area (back to where they fell through??) and a group of the people that helped rescue the WHITE PANTS guy come across her and she tries to show them the flier/picture of the guy she's looking for but before they can help her they are attacked by creatures and the girl falls into a chasm or something. (Then comes a spiked wall fight with NO wires).<br /><br />Eventually, the girl wakes up in a safe place and the guy in the WHITE PANTS finds her and they do some aerial stuff together, flirt, play and fall in love...<br /><br />All in all it's pretty cool - fantastic even.  Sit back and enjoy the dreamlike fantasy - worth watching more than once!things.<br /><br />About 3/5 of the way through, the WHITE PANTS aerialist and the girl almost find each other but are kept apart.

B00APJLFEG|5.0|I loved this movie! It's about a father not wanting to let go of his daughter and the crazy lengths he goes to. It's fast paced, funny and just a nice movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved Downton Abbey....have now seen Season 1, 2, and 3!!  Can hardly wait for Season 4.  Highly recommend for anyone who wants to watch something really GREAT!
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|A little scary for small children but those over 8 years old should love it.  Very creative story and teaches a good lesson.
B00821OW8K|3.0|I am honestly AMAZED at the number of good reviews this show has gotten - seriously, it's barely watchable most of the time.<br /><br />My boyfriend is a sci-fi junkie and while we BOTH laugh at the HUGE/OBVIOUS blunders they constantly make in this series - he continues to insist we watch this mess. (The worse a show is the more he enjoys watching it and laughing at the stupidity).<br /><br />The episodes in season 1 seem pretty repetitive and predictable.  And only on TV would this group of \\"rebels\\" and civilians have lasted this long.  They are large convoys, and really loud and who cares about things like lights - the enemy (who is close) won't see us. . . and of course, they are horrible shots.  They finally develop bullets that will pierce and kill the enemy but the writers/directors seem to forget that as few get taken out.  ... The aliens have these huge metal men that are also very noisy - both by the sounds they make as well as how hard they hit the ground with each step - and they have huge beams of light coming out of them, but gee nobody seems to know they're coming until they are right on top of them.  And the list of crap like this just goes on and on.  (Told ya - I just don't understand how this show got such good reviews)<br /><br />If you want a somewhat intelligent/interesting sci-fi show, this is NOT for you.  If you just want sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi, you might like it.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Season 2 (yes, we're unfortunately still watching so he can laugh at it and pick it apart) is actually a little better... but not much.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|My husband and I both have watched the pilot episode multiple times.  The chemistry between Castle and Beckett is so much fun to watch. She thinks he is a charming bad boy and wonders why he is sticking his nose in her detective work.  He has an insight on her that shows there is more to him than meets the eye.  His homelife is a story all its own - we have a teenager that we can actually adore who has a brilliant future ahead of her, but several ex-wives and a mother who lives in the world of the theater.  I love Castle's writer friends who play poker - real life authors who poke fun at Castle and give an authenticity to the show. Great ensemble cast with great mysteries to solve.  Castle's contributions have more than once been key to finding the killer, but I think his best contribution has been the expresso machine for the precinct.  He may drive Beckett crazy, but she is always one step ahead of him.  Love her.  Love him.  We love this show and only wish they could produce shows faster.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's great fun and the animations are amazing, the only bad bit is when your competing and the pepol look like cardboard cut out's.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Even though the book was fiction, it and the movie were the best work ever done concerning the lack of civil rights in America!<br />The movie brought the characters to life and they were perfect!
B006VFLIYK|3.0|It was an ok book  I would recommend this book to others .it was a quick book to read ok.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|The chemistry between Beckett and Castle make this show work.  She is a top New York detective and seriously thinks Castle is crazy for some of his theories - but she cannot deny that he has solved his share of mysteries because the thinks outside of the box.  This is an ensemble cast that really works.  My only problem is that they cannot produce shows fast enough.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show. Absolutely hooked. You care about each of the characters. Acting is great. Recommend to anyone who likes a good show!
B002PJL85K|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie since it first came out way back when.<br />There is everything you could want in an Arthurian tale- knights, sorcerers, maidens and the sadness that is betrayal. Lots of recognizable stars in their younger days here- Helen Mirren, Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart and Gabriel Byrne.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I'm a real Ken Follett fan.  The only fiction I typically read is in the form of really information-packed historical novels, and this one is every bit up to Follett's standard in that genre.  Since the plot takes place a couple of centuries after the events of Pillars of the Earth, it really isn't a sequel.  While I had already read Pillars when I started this book, doing so added little to World Without End, which stands very well on its own.  This book was a real joy, and I just couldn't put it down!  My only negative comment extends to many of Follett's novels.  He likes to delve into significant detail on sexual encounters, especially when describing instances of rape, so much so that I have refrained from recommending his books to pre-teen or teenage readers.  I'm not a prude by any means, and the language is completely fine for adults, but I'd like to see the realism of Follett's descriptions of day-to-day life in times past be more comfortably available to younger people.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I downloaded this because everyone around me was reading it and the first couple of chapters were okay.  Then we start getting into the disgusting parts.  I am sorry, but I don't care how abused or neglected someone is as a child, they don't need to get domineering about it.  I wanted to shake the female lead and tell her to RUN away as fast as she could.  Maybe if I continued reading I would have been able to get past the pieces of crap, but I see no reason to read page after page of garbage.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A friend recommended this book. I had no idea what it would be about, but I really enjoyed it! I thought it was a quick, easy read. I have recommended it to other friends.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|Every high school students should read this. Every parent and educator should read this!!!  I enjoyed the book and it's a easy read.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Awesome storyline, great acting one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen.  I'm a horror movie buff and thought this was one of the most creative, unpredictable and unique horror flicks ever.
B0091W7K6K|4.0|Movie from 70'su with action and solid story line.  I would recommend to a friends and family whom like action with good plot and surprises.
B007REV4T8|4.0|It is and entertaining movie, it's better than a lot of the 007 films. looking forward to the next 007 to see who plays M
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is wonderful and addictive show, well its very gross at times and may disturb you on the graphics. Absolutely not for kids or teenagers. I really think its a show for mature people in their right sate of mind, after all this is end of world scenario...<br />I really wished that Amazon gave me this shows free as a Prime subscriber, I don't mind paying $1.99 for reg version and $2.99 for HD because its available next day after show airs, but 6 months or so down the line its free. Only difference is I own the episode, not sure i place value on it unless I like to watch show twice or for another family member to see at another time. In summary if you love the show and can't get it anywhere else, your money is well spent here. You will get your addiction for $1.99 to $2.99
B0054SMIH6|3.0|The product was exactly what I expected, so I am not too disappointed. If you want to buy something average, and expect that then this product is for you.
B000EWD1KK|2.0|Great movie, but it does not work on big screen TV's. Only in the old TV mode with black bars on both sides. Too expensive.
0061780308|5.0|Very enjoyable book, I liked the idea of it being written as a dog's point of view of life. More from the same author Please.
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|bought a copy of prog magazine read a review about it and took a chance having never listened to him or porcupine tree,rus and opeth are the only prog bands id listen to til now,put it in the cd player and felt like i was on a 55 minute journey and have listened to it two more times and now gonna start getting into more prog bands
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Each person protrayed their character very well, made it feel real.  I loved the picturesque setting, style of clothing and a glimpse of that era.  It was interesting to see the contrast of society before and after the war.
B007WQYH4K|5.0|ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is Ennio Morricone at his finest, and this is the most complete edition of his masterful score.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|The acting was fine, but the story went no where.  Boring, but I stuck with it in case.  There was no reason to recommend this other than the actors. YUCK!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love temple run2 its the best imangi game i have played. its fun and addictive and really easy. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!-
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|Very interesting and entertaining. A good series much easier to watch with no commercials. Hard to watch one episode in a sitting.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This was very fragmented and pointless, despite good acting talent. I wouldn't waste the time or money on this one!
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|Not nearly as good as expected.  I had hoped for much more.  Compared to the art performed on the TV show this was a let down.  And the acting?  What acting - yes that's what I mean.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is the new addiction amongst my group of friends. We had to purchase the expansion pack because everyone wants to play. I definitely recommend it!
B00B81B0HC|5.0|I bought it for one song, then right before my purchase I recognized a second track, so I started listening to the other tracks , raised my interest, so I got the whole album and I am glad I did
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Here, again, this game doesn't work on my Kindle Fire.  I wish it did. I have chosen several games that can't be used on the Kindle Fire.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Im going to make this short...It has a cute storyline but lacks the humor that most other animated movies these days. I think it is enjoyable for all ages but just don't expect many laughs.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|No, this isn't the Yes of old. I didn't want to like it, as I am a Jon Anderson fan. But this CD contains wonderful music that can't be ignored. If you have to pretend it's not Yes, go ahead. But give it a listen. This album could have been called \\"Drama Phase Two\\". In all honesty I can say that musically this album blows \\"Keystudio\\", \\"Open Your Eyes\\", \\"The Ladder\\" and \\"Magnification\\" out of the water. And I truly love all of those (except \\"Open Your Eyes\\"). It's been about 2 years since \\"FFH\\" came out and I first heard it. This album is strong enough to stand up proud among the other albums in the Yes canon. At first I thought it was foolish to attempt to reconstruct the leftover \\"Drama\\" track \\"Fly From Here\\", but it works. They did a great job on this. Expanded to epic proportions without it sounding like they just made it long on purpose. Not a bad track on here. My favorite is \\"Into The Storm\\". I say good luck to anyone who keeps Yes moving into the future. I will listen...And R.I.P., Peter Banks.
B008Q1T1IW|5.0|The range makes sense ,and does not jump from one song you like, to something that does not fit the mood.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This is a fun game  I find the controls very sensitive  for my age (65) even resetting them but it,s still fun
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The book kept my interest and was similar to THE LION which I preferred over this book....but it was interesting reading.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|enjoyed the period drama! very good acting, plot that takes you through the story. I am waiting to see season 3
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This is a great show. The quality on my PC is very poor. I wish Amazon would update their streaming service to provide better quality on the PC.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I'm glad I got this app for free because I don't think it's worth the money. There are only two maps and that would be ok for a free version. If I had paid for this I'd be very disappointed. Also, it could be a lot scarier. Simple things like making slender man walk or maybe they could add scary laughter. They should make it easier to move because I've lost a few times because I panicked an couldn't get the thing to move.
B007U8U1V8|4.0|We all evolve. Jack White is a talented guy who is along his own journey. I just hope that one day he gets back to his roots rock guitar that made him famous.<br />  I agree that the first 7 songs on Blunderbuss are great; and really make a statement. But the remainder, with the exception of the last track, could be called \\"filler\\". But filler on a high level!<br />  I've been listening to this alongside T-Rex's \\"Electric Warrior\\" & \\"Slider\\". Jack's music holds up well next to past styles; and thats a pretty good compliment to a true visionary of our modern musical era. We need more guys like Jack White. Listen to \\"Blunderbuss\\" and you'll see what I mean.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Placed 10 CDs of. ripped albums on a memory card with 10 directories.  Approximately 1500 tunes.  Works great.  Only want I have is it will not shuffle within a single directory.  The shuffle function is over the entire memory selections.  When a Christmas tune comes up in July, I just touch the lower right button and go to the next selection.
B00AHTYI5M|2.0|I must admit that I have not yet seen this film - not of all it. After half an hour of nauseating unhistorical propaganda, I felt that I had had enough. Despite the forty million or so budget, it appears that the film was set in controlled locations - reminiscent of  the typical stage sets supposed to represent 'hostile middle Eastern' countries that are shown in a typical episode of the TV series NCIS Los Angeles.<br />  Apart from the fact that this film insults allies of the U.S (Britain and Canada- by misrepresenting their roles in the affair), there are other inaccuracies. The USA has often made a point that its embassy everywhere in the world is the same as US soil. Nobody could refute this. Indeed, this principle well applies to all embassies everywhere. However, history has made some Iranians (and other people) think that certain guest nations in their countries have gone beyond this. They have not only regarded  their embassy as native soil - but rather, they have sometimes regarded the country in which their embassy is situated as American soil as well.<br />  Although America is often dependant on British support, there is no country more 'fanatical' in its celebration of independence than America when it comes to celebrating its independence from British sovereign rule. The Americans were completely right to want independence from a British monarch. So why,then, two centuries later, should they impose a monarch on the Iranian people! The oppressed Iranian people had a right not to want the shah and the brutal western-backed SAVAK that supported him.<br />  Extreme situations have often precipitated extreme responses. There were many who were against the storming of the American Embassy (including the current prime minister of Iran). It is possible that the interference of  the CIA against the Iranian Revolution made some Iranians distrust the American presence - as if it were some kind of Trojan Horse. They did not bomb the embassy; they stormed it and took hostages. Perhaps the cynic would remark that many countries also make hostages out of their OWN citizens - whenever and wherever there is poverty and injustice. A person with the 'wrong' skin colour, who is deprived of social welfare, education, state benefits and free health care is also a hostage! And this kind of hostage has a worse predicament - as there is no possibility of ransom.<br />  Although I can understand the motivation behind the Iranian revolutionaries, I condemn their taking of hostages. However, it is a sad irony to postulate that those hostages actually guaranteed Iran's safety. No sooner had the hostages been released than America incited Saddam Husein to wage war. Enough misery was caused as a result of this war and films like this do not contribute anything positive by misinterpreting history. Perhaps,however, there will be one good outcome of this film: The Iranians have promised to respond with their own version. I shall look forward immensely to a film which will provide a completely different treatment of these sad events. Like many masterpieces of the Iranian cinema, I expect it to be art - a work of art (not low-quality entertainment) that will deal with a painful episode of history with the sensitivity it deserves.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|One of the best films in my life time. I have seen it well over 30 times..................LOST COUNT...........Very well made.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|I think its a great pilot to show how the cast got together in the first place. Has nice mixtures of beings from different cultures.  I love it.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I love this show. It's pretty interesting. It also explains a lot of Physics and stuffs!! No wonder I fell for it at last... :)
B002L3ARRU|4.0|Great movie! Take you back to when times were simpler. Would recommend to all movie lovers a great family pick also.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|I ordered this movie because I haven't been able to find it anywhere else and nobody seems to have hear of it. I first saw the movie when my ex-boyfriend's father recorded it off a movie channel years ago. I got nightmares from it and eventually lost the movie. I wanted to give my friends the same experience I had and to make sure this movie stays in my collection.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I expected the vocabulary and descriptive eloquence of the HP series.  Got a trashy, curt story instead.  I don't mind cursing, but only if it enhances the story.  Gratuitous vulgarity is for cheap movies.
0553386816|5.0|I have not previously read a John Grisham novel, so this is my first Grisham fiction. (I did read his one book of non-fiction, \\"An Innocent Man\\".)After cataract surgery, I was looking in the library for large-print books per doctor's orders to exercise my \\"new vision\\" -- and this book looked like it could be interesting.<br /><br />I can only say \\"WOW\\"-- this guy can write short stories!  I have never read a collection of short stories before where every single one was a gem. There are no failures here -- none! My favorites are probably  \\"Fish Files\\" and \\"Quiet Haven\\"-- probably because they deal most directly (of the 7 stories) with the darker side of human nature, as expressed in ordinary run-of-the-mill type people, ala Alfred Hitchcock or Rod Serling's Twilight Zone. These stories are phenomenal for the deft character development and the twisty story-telling that unfolds so effortlessly. Every story draws you in from the start and has the reader wondering just what, exactly, is going on here. The Southern small-town life is depicted wonderfully and the personalities are generated as full-fledged and believable.  That Grisham is able to do this in the short form, consistently, is astounding. Highly recommended. Couldn't put it down, except when my eyes got tired -- and I couldn't wait for my eyes to get rested!Wish there were more Grisham short stories.<br /><br />In contrast, I was also reading another large-print book at the same time: \\"Think Twice\\" -- a novel by Lisa Scottoline. This happens to offer a good contrast in writing talent: Scottoline had a whole novel to develop characters and action.  Yet all Grisham's stories and characters were far more developed and believable.  Grisham's talent towers over Scottoline.
B004W25KKW|5.0|This is not a book I would normally buy.  It is a writer's non-fiction tale of his interest and then addicition to his topic.  Foer became interested in annual memory championships, in which a rogue's gallery of oddballs and freaks from around the world get together to compete in events such as memorizing and regurgitating the sequences of decks of cards or numbers, poetry, or other odd games.  In his reportage, he was convinced by one of the subjects he interviewed that he, too, could do what the competitors did.  Immersing himself into a year of practice, frustrations, and investigation, he became obsessed, and ultimately won success in the competition he chose to enter.<br /><br />In his report, he guides the reader along what his difficulties were and what successes he had, with a somewhat clear-eyed view that this was a bit silly, as neither anyone to whom he talks nor he himself advance practical usage for this competition, as might be argued by the ghosts in the room, Harry Lorayne and Tony Buzan, who have made careers out of memory training.  Foer makes reference to the ancients, and the importance memory had to those who were not literate and did not have printing presses, libraries, or the internet to use as crutches for information.  Along the way, he hints at, but does not say that the more trained and disciplined minds of the past, admittedly possessed of a select few that were not required to plow fields and hunt for living, were better and fitter than today;s couch potatoes.<br /><br />I sought out this book because I was interested in practical applications of \\"memory palace\\" work to improve my recall of facts and law in cases I work at as a lawyer, and to enhance my recall of music to play the guitar and to remember vocabulary in my study foreign languages.  Frankly, I was disappointed initially that \\"Moonwalking . . . \\" did not teach the art and science of remembering, but, it hooked me, despite only hitting the highlights of those things.  I doubtthat Foer chose that title, which looks to have been selected for marketing purposes, rather than a true picture of what this book is about.<br /><br />Foer's book is simply one man's facinating journey self-discovery that just happens to be about memory and remembering.<br /><br />David O'Connell
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I thought the book started out slow.  Just a teenage romance.  It took a while for the real story to start to come through, about 3/4 of the book.  There was a great twist which completely took me by surprise! Worth getting through it.
0765325950|5.0|Great ending to a long series- pleasing for we who have read faithfully all these years! Satisfying, action-filled with most plot lines resolved!
B004P02OJ6|5.0|I was completely engaged throughout the entire movie - watching an educated man, loving husband and father, think his way through constant complex criminal, ethical and moral dilemmas
B0062NAX1U|1.0|4 police officers and a contractor go through trials and tribulations.<br /><br />They pray to God for help and eventually sign a document in which they promise to honor God and be good fathers after tragedy strikes one of them.<br /><br />There is very little character development and the film tells the viewer loud and clear that following God is the only way.<br /><br />In my opinion, the director seems more concerned about sending a message than presenting an interesting/plausible storyline.<br /><br />Would not recommend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book started out slowly as, I suspected it would, then rapidly picked up. It kept me wondering &#34;What's to come?&#34; all the way to the last page
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Fantastic story, thought I was familiar with all of the music out of the 70's, but, somehow missed this wonderful artist.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I really enjoy the character development and the relationships formed under intense duress; plus the action scares the pee-waddy out of me!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Well worth the time and money. All exercises are clearly explained. Beginners are encouraged to keep going and the workout is challenging for advanced excercisers as well.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|If you previously downloaded and installed the Osmosis demo, you must uninstall it before you can install this version.  Bad development practice, but fun game.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Amelie is one of my favorite films. Not only is it a wonderful, playful tale of love, but it also has stunning visuals that leave me breathless.<br /><br />This blu ray does a wonderful job of putting those visuals into high def.
B0041VT6HW|3.0|it's kind of weird to be a western. it is a far fetched story, but it's ok.<br />you really get lost with the story, if you don't pay attention.<br />ms. paula
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey, either the original UK or the US version is fabulously produced. The sets, the vehicles, the acting are great.  The only complaint is the audio, which seems to be same with all productions British.  I use CC for all the British features.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|My favorite LOTR movie by far. Exceptional story,acting,cinematography,and of course brilliant directing by Peter Jackson. I'll definitely be watching this movie again and again.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Truly wonderful. Just see it. This is coming from a life-long Connery fan who lived in the 60s. Skyfall pays tasteful homage to Connery-era Bond, the writing is solid, the direction executes a vision, the performances are tight.
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|This'll be short, sweet, and to the point: In my biased and non-expert opinion, this is the best Rachmaninoff concerto set I have ever heard.<br /><br />Great work, Valentina. Can't wait for your Liszt project! =)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|One of the most exhilarating journeys I've ever had I read through all three books so fast I wish they were longer.
B00001OH7O|5.0|Written in the voice of Rain, from my erotic novel, [[ASIN:B00A2F1VS8 Rye]]: This is like orgasm-on-a-stick. Or maybe on a plate. Or at least on a round shiny thingie that you find won't ever leave your CD player. Dad and I wore the grooves off this CD back in the day; I sat petulant on the couch, staring at that cover photo of beautiful androgynous Bowie in his prime. And in my ears he's amalgamizing folk and rock, and getting down-right rockin' on \\"Queen Bitch\\" (this album was recorded just a bit before he launched into the sessions for ZIGGY, you can hear it in the heavier tracks). Bowie was a mere 24-year-old lad when he recorded this; why did they have such grace and power back in those days? Show me a 24-year-old pop-star today who gets anywhere near this one.... (I'm waiting!)... Can't, can ya? And yes, yes, \\"Kooks\\" is THE SONG for every non-traditional kid with cool parents who encouraged their oddness, rather than squelch it. \\"I bought you a pair of shoes. A trumpet you can blow. And a book of rules. On what to say to people when they pick on you. 'Cause if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty Kookie too.\\" Thanks Dad. Bowie is our king, and this is one of his bestests.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great continuation from season 1.  The characters are great.  The characters I hated I come to love.  I even love the ones I still hate.  Can't get enough of this show.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The movie did not meet my expectations as an Oscar winner film. There was more sentionalization than actual story. This was my first experience as a movie rental from Amazon and I was not sure what to expect. It terned out to be quite simple process.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This series is addictive!!  Very high production quality,  a &#34;feast for the eyes&#34; in all aspects. And, of course, a fascinating story!
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|The movie is beautifully shot & VERY well-acted, but it seemed as if the script was pretending to have more depth than it truly did.  There was no real &#34;there&#34; there.  Or at least that's how it seemed to me.  Perhaps my expectations were simply too high, but I was disappointed.
B0087UN94E|4.0|This was a total impulse buy. I listened to some snippits  and  started laughing. So, I downloaded it. As a fan of folk music I can say that Neil's grungy updates are well worth the listen and done with a great sense of humor.<br />If you like Neil and Crazy Horse, which I have since &#34;Everybody Knows this is Nowhere&#34;  Buy this.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie! I just love Jack Black. Great story line and great characters. GOOD CHRISTMAS FLICK
B0054SMIH6|5.0|This movie keeps you guessing until the end.  The story is suspenseful, well developed, and brilliantly executed by an impressive cast.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I was ok enough to pass time but not worth all the effort to get all of the games. it takes too long to get enough points
B007H1HQW0|2.0|I was so excited to get this thing. Directions are fairly easy to follow, good pictures. I got it setup and I've tried four times to cut a bottle and am struggling with this. I'm listening for that sound of glass being scratched, going slow, consistent. I then pour hot water over the cut line then alternate with cold and or ice in cold water with little luck. It's not to say this product isn't a great idea, I may just be struggling with how to properly cut glass, at least the way I want it to be cut. So, I will keep practicing with the hopes that I will master it, at which time I'll  return to add to this review.
B0058FW06Y|3.0|I rented this movie for 48 hours. I started watching it about 2 hour before my time was up renting the movie but it cut off about an hour in advance which was a surprise to me. I have had great service with Amazon but was disappointed in the fact that I paid for a movie for 48 hours but only got to watch it for 46 hours...Also I think if you start a movie before your time is up but it goes longer then the time you rented the movie should be able to continue to watch movie until its totally over with.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This is a great movie and would recommend it to anyone, doesn't get much better than this. Has all the things a great movie should have.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is awesome I even have it on my ipod. I suggest that anyone who loves horses should get this game.
1594484805|5.0|Required text for school. A informative and detailed book that helps you understand the dynamics of a management professional. The complexity of management and human relations is easily understood to a certain level.
B009EEDJOM|4.0|This is a great movie and the price was just right for the HD version. The download was a little slow but this is a very long movie. Otherwise enjoying my experience with Amazon Prime!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A wonderful book, fixing to buy the movie because the book was so good.  I know the movie won't be as good as the book but wow.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I ended up purchasing this after the initial free version because it was interesting enough to want to continue. Played moderate level and still needed a couple of hints, so was challenging enough for my taste. Worked great on my kindle fire hd 7.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Another season has come and gone, after so much anticipation for the season to actually start again. Love Downton! Did not love the way this season ended, but....actors move on.
B000HZED8S|4.0|Amazon Prime is amazing and enjoy having the capability to watch a movie anywhere with my IPad. I also enjoy the fact that these movies stream so well in any location with internet.
B0056CUZRA|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book,I enjoyed the authors way of writing and look<br />forward to reading more of this authors works.The characters were real and<br />interesting and the story kept you there in the midst of everything that was<br />happening.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|It is a sad story, but it is probably based on a truth. The acting was great. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under 18, because of the nudity.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Enjoyed A Tree Grows in Brooklyn very much. It is about life for a young girl growing up in Brooklyn in the 40's.
B00AH69ZN0|5.0|Price for music is expensive not just on this site but on all sights and I also think if your an Amazon Prime Member you should be able to get discounts on Music or able to play music for free from the website through an app on your phone just like you can do with Amazon Prime Movies.  Otherwise download was quick, easy and service was great!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I'm 68 years old and love to read. My wife also loves to read. The only con I have with kindle for Android is that the Amazon website is very difficult for me to navigate to manage my kindle. When I finish my book I would like to share it with my wife on her Android. Instructions are very confusing to me and have not been able to figure it out how to do this. Confusion comes when I get to send to.<br />Directions a vague and I can't seem to add another device like my wife's tablet. Can someone help here?<br />jtozzie
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|If you have a Monster High Fan, they will love this double feature.  Fast paced and fun movies for any Monster High fan.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|loved it! awesome season. can't wait for the next. i'm following the series because I found it here on amazon.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is one of my favorite  games on my kindle but you need to blow up tnt in creative mode
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I have read most of this series. ( 30 yrs. ago)  Enjoying just as much as the first time. I may have to go back and read it all over again.
B008220C56|1.0|What on earth was Joe Wright thinking?! I loved the novel. I disliked the film very much. The acting was so-and-so, directing was eh. Not worth twenty dollars they ask for it. Maybe five dollars for the blu-ray, even then you'll still be disappointed you bought it.
B003M70O5O|5.0|even better than the first season. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I like the game because it keeps you interested...definitely worth the price and I have a lot of these games and this one is one of my favorites. I recommend to anyone who is thinking about downloading.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|This is my second purchase of this movie...it is a favorite of my grandchildren and mine.  It is acted by British actors throughout and the dialogue is understandable.  The story line follows the simple story of Peter Pan and Captain Hook well.  I feel the idea of &#34;You do not need to go looking far for the blessings in life.  They are right in front of you every day.&#34;  At least I think that is the lesson which is taught.  My grandchildren, some of whom are 12 and over, still sit and watch this and are fascinated by the magical sequences throughout the movie.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|i really liked the book, very well don the only problem I had with it was the ending, didn't really care for that part.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It started off a bit slow. I wondered where it was headed, but wow, when it took off. What a ride!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|This is a book about teenagers for teenagers. Mature readers will find it boring as the characters and plot are not very challenging.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book has one of the slowest starts in fiction that I can ever recall reading. Once you slog through it, the climax is certainly captivating yet the denouement leaves you wondering whether the journey was worth the time. Rowling demonstrates her prowess at weaving a complex plot, once again, but the reader remains fundamentally unchanged by the events of the book. I appreciated her attempt to write something other than a teen fantasy novel and truly look forward to her next book. Since she has accomplished so much through the Harry Potter series, I am not willing to write her off just yet. This book is competent, just not compelling.
B000I3R796|5.0|I couldn't stop watching the movie.  My husband laughed because I couldn't take my eyes off the television. I was not planning to enjoy the movie and was surprised it was so good.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|The graphics are cool and slick with plenty going on. There are many challenges along the way with twists and turns.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|My husband and I have watched all the movies nominated for an Oscar in 2013.  This one is the worst.  If you'd like to catch up on you  sleep...this is the movie for you.<br />Even Philip S Hoffman's role was not Oscar nominee worthy, and he is such an excellent actor.<br />In essence, crazy WWII veteran finds friendship in a cult run by another crazy and his posse.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I had a formatting question - don't most of us newbies and it answered my question simply and easily.  I highly recommend reading if you are formatting your own book for Kindle.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I just can not imagine this Blue Ray Disc of EVA can be that cheap.  I am a huge fan of EVA, I grow up with it and it change the way I evaluate every thing around me.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game. I play it when I get home from work to unwind. Never the same puzzle twice. . I love love love love this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! It is very creative and super fun I play it all the time. Favorite game! Luv it! I think you should get it because it is AWESOME! I could go on forever but I will give you a little summary of the game. You are on a rail road track and you try to dodge the moving trains and get as many coins and prizes as you can. Some of the prizes include a mystery box the jump starts and if you get a thing that looks like 2 spray cans you can fly. If you have enough coins you can get special prizes. Hope you get it.
B000244FDW|5.0|This BBC miniseries, featuring Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth Bennet and David Rintoul as Mr Darcy is as faithful to Jane Austen's novel as it is possible to be. In this regard, the gimmicks that so deface the later BBC miniseries, such as Colin Firth's plunging into a pool and emerging with his wet shirt clinging to his chest, are thankfully absent here. Elizabeth Garvie's singing in her performance of the Ash Grove is an absolute delight, while Rintoul's portrayal of Darcy from beginning to end could scarcely be bettered. The one (tiny) flaw I detect in this version is in the casting of the actress who plays Lydia Bennet. Lydia should be taller more imposing than this Lydia, who is small and physically insignificant. -- Doug Tucker .
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I just can not imagine this Blue Ray Disc of EVA can be that cheap.  I am a huge fan of EVA, I grow up with it and it change the way I evaluate every thing around me.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|This slowed my kindle down to turtle speed. After I bought it my kindle wouldn't work until I uninstalled it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Though I don't know how to play it well but my kids love 'em!<br />Some functions I didn't get yet.<br />We'll see if I could play them ^_^!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|GREAT book, highly recommend it. Wish I read it 30 years ago! Mike emphasizes nutrition, explaining well, along with proper rest and of course the actual work outs. I struggled for years with the feeling that I did not have that much to show for my efforts, but I didn't know why.<br />I'm following Mike's advice and am seeing very positive results in a short time. It's great to have someone show you the simple steps that are not simple if you don't know them.<br />Thank you Mike, really appreciate it.<br />I originally bought Mike's 'The Shredded Chef' and liked it so much I bought all of Mike's book in Kindle format. I recommend all of Mike's books.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|NOOOOOOOO ITS ENDED!!!!!!!!I'm so so so so sad! This was the best trilogy ever! If only this trilogy went on forever
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Wow, this is a ver funny and fun game.  I start to play and just can not put this away for the day.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to start watching this.  Best scifi drama I've seen in years.  Every episode is a new twist with something to surprise you.
B007VYDFMS|4.0|I didn't know much about the man behind the music.  However, this documentary unveiled a lot of the mystery and romanticism surrounding this iconic figure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this game. Fun, Exciting, fast paced, good graphics. Similar to temple run but different setting. Definite game to get
B0086700CM|5.0|I enjoy this very much.  My husband has a great time playing this too.  Our grand kids haver it on their game system and they enjoy it also.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|One of the most beautiful stories I have ever read and Ang Lee did a fabulous job of bringing this tale to the big screen. Your are whisked away and dropped into India and then onto a ship that sinks and onto an incredible journey of survival.  This book is a must read!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I think this is one of the best series on TV. I look forward to each episode. I never thought this would be the type of show I would like. I was wrong and I'm glad I started watching this most addictive show.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My wife and I have 4 children, from 7 through teen years and we all enjoyed watching this together. It captivates all ages and has a little bit for everyone - humor, drama, action.  Even has stuff for bad guys!  Remember, just because you play a bad guy, doesn't mean you're a bad guy!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|i just love being on face book on my desk top computer.  I send a couple hours a day visiting friends and family.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The storyline, the acting, the character development, the setting, the antiques on the set.....the whole package is glorious!  The only reason I even discovered this series is because of Amazon Prime; totally worth it!  Even though season 3 was not available to watch via Prime I did get to see all of it.  I highly recommend this series....once you watch you will be hooked!
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I have read all of these books and I really enjoyed them all. I only wished that they would have showed more of a background of the \\"wicked\\"  other than that they are very exciting and I would recommend it to anyone!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My Galaxy S III has been a great phone but Google play books doesn't have an adequate selection of books and they way Google tries to make everything &#34;stream by default&#34; causes me to use more of my data plan and CPU cycles than I want or need. The Kindle application is superior and when combined with the Galaxy S III display size and quality I have the perfect set up.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This keeps you up to date and informed.  It gives the town that you live in weather.  I would tell anyone to get this.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|Who doesnt like Jane Austen? I love to go back and read the classics from time to time. It helps that my kids are now reading these in school.
B00AK0X5VQ|2.0|Seems like a good game and tons of great reviews. But I can't get past the tutorial where it wants a &quot;2 finger tap&quot; the continue.  Worth picking it up for FAOTD though. I'll use it once I get a larger device.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Really liked this game. It held my interest extremely well.  It's a great game for serious HO and puzzle lovers. Give it a go!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so fun, you will not want to do anything but play this all the time.  The only way I stop playing is when the battery runs dead then I have to put it up for the day.
B000HF0ISC|5.0|An amazing cast with some terrific performances.  My only beef with the film was the length.  Barry could have tightened some of the scenes in post.  It spent way too much time with the preamble and we could have moved into the incarceration of the juveniles a lot faster.<br /><br />We need to talk about the subject of sexual abuse among men more. There are over 20 million men in our country who are victims, and they live with a tremendous amount of shame.  1 in 6 men will have been sexually abused by the age of 17 and one in 5 men will have been abused by the age of 18.  But like the kids in the film sum it up, which is the one of the tragic attitudes:  keep it to yourself... never tell anyone.  And its that silence that eventually eats the older versions of the characters alive.<br /><br />We need more movies about this subject.  It's a harrowing story, and Kevin Bacon is astonishing as the abuser.  Mr. Bacon is extremely underestimated as an actor.  He's definitely not the &#34;guy from Footloose&#34; in this film.  He's the jailer from Hell.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Charming. Entertains you perfectly WITHOUT rupturing your nerves with unearthly puzzles and hard-to-believe risky situations! Drags you into its pleasant world and won't let you go away :)
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downtown Abbey has provided many hours of pure enjoyment and excellent acting.  Looking forward to the next series in the fall.
B007T8BYWE|4.0|Like these kinda games. Helps me waste a lot of time but interesting enough to keep me playing. Good fun.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|This movie was neither exciting, nor interesting.  It was just blah.  Not sure what wrong, but as a action lover, this movie was just average.  You didn't care for any of the characters and it was just all over the place.<br /><br />No where near as good as the book.
1592407889|5.0|I am happy with the interesting life of Sachi Parker, the only child to actress Shirley MacLaine. From the early years of her life until today Sachi has laughed, cried and been in the light that is Shirley MacLaine. I can see why Shirley MacLaine has said that &#34;Terms of Endearment&#34; was her best film. I agree and I think she had a similar connection and relationship with her daughter, Sachi.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Again, a great series to watch.  The sequel to Seasons 1 and 2.  Excellent acting and casting of characters.  Love it.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|At last, an unpredictable story line! This book held my interest 'til the very end. Well written and intelligently planned out. This is a great read.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|It was a great movie. Really keeps you on your toes. Would def recommend to anyone looking for a movie to watch
B00BLH1KJQ|5.0|Weird and Wonderful.  I saw it about six weeks ago and am still thinking about it.  I ordered the DVD and can't wait for  it to arrive so I  can see it again because I know I missed a lot seeing it only once.
B0014ERKO0|2.0|Maybe I just lost interest due to horrid acting but I couldn't follow the story...I know nothing of the series so my opinion is sorta worthless.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It's awesome cool addicting fun I want to play every day or I go mad<br />I LOVE AND WANT TO PLAY A SECOND ONE OF THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE ONE
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This is a great children's movie that also had a good message of acceptance and being kind to others. Love the retro arcade characters too!
B009RI4FRU|3.0|Sometimes slow, sometimes sweet, sometimes interesting but not all at once. Love bill Murray and was under used. Kids were weird and sweet.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I purchased this thing with the intent to have a product that holds my iPod Touch in place. Well, to my surprise, it works perfectly! I couldn't ask for more! Sure, it's a little short, but it mentions as much in the product description!
B00BESIKWM|2.0|OK story...just boring. The first Silent Hill was &#34;better.&#34; Wait until it's free because it's not worth your money or you time. Might be useful as playing silently on your TV during a Halloween party.
0307749347|5.0|This audio book has the potential to change your life if you apply the 7 principles the author puts forth. I listen to it in my car wherever I go and I have a much more positive outlook than I did before. The author used extensive research over many years to back up his claims so these are not just some guy's opinion. It is the true formula for success & happiness in this modern world so listen & learn then apply to your everyday life. You'll begin to see change happening to your thinking rather quickly.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I regretfully bought this book after Chris was murdered, I wish I would have gone to one of his signings in the area as he was easily accessible from all accounts. Chris is a great Texan, and reading his story in his words is pretty amazing. If there weren't records to corroborate his accomplishments, they would be hard to believe. It's an easy read, I bought it on kindle and finished it in a few hours.
B006HL9G10|4.0|This is a nice little timer that ends your meditation or goes off at intervals. That's about it, and it's free.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I'm more of a realist, what are the chances of a zombie apocalypse actually happening? Well if it did, I imagine it might go down in some way shape or form presented by TWD. The main characters are compelling and you can empathize with the choices they make daily that have life and death consequences.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was by far the moment st intense book I've ever read, I simply could boot put it down.  I am going to get the next 2 as soon as I can.  However that is going to be a week or  maybe even longer because I am rather behind on  quite a bit of work and personal matters because I have been so engrossed in this book.
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|There are plenty of plot synopses in this section already, so if you want to know the premise or even EVERYTHING that happens, please read the other reviews.<br /><br />Most negative reviews seem to be from people who expected the movie to be as self-important as a LOTR film, or go out of its way to avoid the mythic quest conventions that Lucas drew on for the first Star Wars film and Tolkien drew on for Hobbit and LOTR, or that Baum drew on for Wizard of Oz, or Wagner drew on for Nibelung, or Mozart drew on for Magic Flute, or . . . .  Brush up on your Jung, folks, and get off your high horse.<br /><br />Now that our culture's most serious fantasy work (LOTR) has been filmed with an appropriate budget and reasonable direction, it's easy to go back and claim that Willow is sort of a \\"Lord of the Rings Light.\\"  What's wrong with that?<br /><br />Don't expect to spend half the movie tied up in knots or to come away emotionally drained.<br /><br />Expect to see enough gags and over-the-top action stunts to let you know that NO ONE involved with the production imagined they were making the fantasy film to end all fantasy films.<br /><br />By the way, this is my favorite appearance for both Val Kilmer and Warwick Davis.  Also, though a 20-something who grew up on LOTR just told me that she considered Willow \\"old school,\\" it holds up better than most other fantasy films of its era (Ladyhawke being the other exception).<br /><br />BTW, a number of the complaints about the DVD seem to be that the so called \\"special edition\\" had few extras.  The blu-ray seems to have some nice ones. If you've already seen it on VHS on a 19\\" screen, consider giving it a try in Hi-Def on a big screen.<br /><br />Look forward to a fun evening of swordfights, magic, magical creatures, evil sorceresses, evil commanders with cliched ugly masks, love (and hate) at first sight, and more.<br /><br />Paul Race - School Of The Rock

044654759X|4.0|Nicholas Sparks books are pretty formulaic. For a long time you could pretty much figure out the ending about 20 pages in. There would be a tumultuous relationship. Tears. Laughter. Love making. And then someone would die or the relationship would end, leaving you wondering why you would spend an entire book getting emotionally involved in these characters only to have the 'happy ending' ripped away from you. So I stopped reading about the time I read \\"Dear John\\" which absolutely infuriated me.<br /><br />Save Haven was a nice change of pace. Still formulaic. If you've seen \\"Sleeping With The Enemy\\" you pretty much know this book. But it was still good. I liked the characters and found them believeable.<br /><br />I do have to warn you. If you picked this book up because you saw the movie, be prepared. The book is completely different from the movie. To the point where at times I wondered if I was reading the right book. But ultimately I liked the book much better.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Reader worked well but did not like Android interface. Converted to Apple IOS and Adobe reader was great! Don't like Android
B00127RAJY|5.0|It was worth every dollar. I really lost lots of inches on it, but then my children took it away from me and I haven't seen it since
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Richard Ford has said that his goal when writing is to keep his readers wanting to keep reading. In Canada, he has achieved his goal. Not only is this an engrossing page turner. but his prose is a pleasure in itself. I read Canada in three days, and once my need to know the outcome was satisfied, I reread it just for the pure pleasure of the prose. Richard Ford creates characters that are fully developed, describes the sights and sounds of their environment in wonderful detail, and provides wisdom that we can all use in this life.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book details and summarizes the training of the Navy SEAL team and intelligence studies that preceded the mission that<br />led to the death of Osama  Bin Laden.

B005PK1G76|4.0|Doesn't work at all to hold drinks of any kind on my city mini gt stroller. Good organizer though overall-good fabric and sturdy. Wish it worked for us!
B0026IUXME|5.0|This is an excellent movie!  If you wish to view a realistic and incredibly moving portrayal of Polish Jews under German oppression, this is it.  Of all the War films depicting the cruelty of German enforced rule, this is certainly one of the best.  It depicts one man's heroic struggle to survive the deadly oppression that was Nazi Germany.  Adrien Brody stars as an acclaimed Jewish pianist (Wladyslaw Szpilman) living in Warsaw, when Hitler's war machine crushes Poland.  Forced into a ghetto and systematically humiliated, starved, and brutally oppressed, he must somehow find the means to survive the brutal oppression of the Nazi occupation.  His journey is a appalling one, filled with endless hurdles that threaten his survival, yet, a journey that will grip the viewer until the very end.<br /><br />If you watch only one film on the oppressive regime of Nazi Germany, this is the one to watch.  Not recommend for children under the age of 13.  Parental discretion advised due to intense violence.<br /><br />kone
B007D15N1K|1.0|It was a big disappointment. There are pages and pages where nothing happened. The characters are not interesting and the story is not coherent. The writer seemed very arrogant, she wants show to the world how good writer she is.
B007REV4T8|5.0|It is a great movie! Loved how with this 007 we were taken back to understand how it all came to be.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|I am just learning the ends and outs of this game.  I hope  I can learn to make the turns, jumps, slides and other moves.  I think I will like it the more that I play it.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I love buying movies from Amazon Prime, very easy, inexpensive, and mine to keep.  This is the wave of the future.  Amazon strikes again!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This has been a fun game to let my 4 and 6 year old grand sons play.  They even let Poppa have a go at it.  We have a good time trying to get rid of the pigs.
B001MM28JG|5.0|You don't have to be a Star Trek fan to laugh.<br /><br />If you are a Star Trek fan, you will howl.<br /><br />I can watch this thing time and again and still just belly laugh.  Read Shatner's review of it....
B007GCY8FS|4.0|It's a good book for a Jack Reacher fan although it runs a little slow for a while in the beginning.  After many twists and turns, it all comes together for an interesting plot.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Les Mis was required reading in my high school. Although Victor Hugo is a classic author,  I have never known any author to take so long to say so little. Perhaps this is due to the fact that his mother tongue was French (which is why English is the language of business and aviation). Frankly I was bored to tears. A recent film of Les Mis was even worse.......despite its popularity. To be fair, my patience seems to be running out proportionately to my increase in years! I doubt there will be any left if I live much longer.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Was a good series, wasn't exactly what I expected.  Wasn't as shocking as I expected, but then again I am very open minded
B000SJJCX4|5.0|This workk well however I do get some residual noise that causes the meter to shift to to flat side of the range. I may need new cables.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It kept with the same story line and kept me very interested and wanting to know more. Ready for part 3
B004UID2LC|3.0|I don't like the look of YouTube downloaded. I would enjoy it if it looked like the original stylish youtube.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Had the free version but wanted to wake up to my own music. Worth the price and nice not to see anymore ads.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|quick easy read and a page turner as it keeps you interested. I would recommend it.  I think this has been made into a movie. nice little surprise for me.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Love the Great graphic!!! Challenging levels. Hope there is a sequel. Looking for more games like it. Trying to write this review was more challenging then the game.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I've read many accounts of Near Death Experiences and this one was very different.  I appreciate the authors candor and courage in telling his story.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I have tried on a lot of watches, and have been looking for a new watch to buy for a while. The problem was that many of the watch faces were too big for my wrist. Not only does this watch have the perfect sized watch face, the band can wrap around my wrist comfortably without an annoying flap. This is my first automatic movement watch, but I like it so far!
B0041D843M|5.0|T. Colin Campbell is one of the most highly respected medical researchers on the planet.  This book is complete, straight-forward and most of all - factual.  It is a must-read for everyone.  The lessons learned in this book will change the way you look at food for the rest of your life.  I hope you will love yourself enough to read it, but at least read it if you care about someone you are preparing meals for.  Children are innocent and look to us to teach them the right way to eat.  If you are feeding your loved ones food that will undoubtedly make them sick, you are on the wrong path.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A page turner despite the dark theme. Good plot structure.  I liked the way the author choose to tell the story through the character's diary.  I was surprised at the ending.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is one of my ultimate favorites! It is a love story where it is all about character development and some quest has to be completed. It is amazingly written. There is a reason this book is a classic
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The only complaint I have is I come from a law enforcement family and this makes ALL cops look dirty. I hope anyone who watches it keeps in mind it IS a TV show and not 100% reality. I know there are some dirty cops but not as many as portrayed in this show.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Sooo many uses.<br />Really, it can save so much time with creating short cuts to keys.  Adobe is simplified with all the shortcuts you can place per key.<br />MMO's made simple.<br />BF3, Crysis 3/2/1/1.5, and any game all are so much more fun without looking for the keys.  Just a quick programming through the software and you are set.<br />Easy software.<br />Great color selection.<br />Reliable and still running without issues, and it is less strain on the hands/fingers/wrists.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|One of the most unusual books I have read.  I want to see the movie.  I will be looking for more books by Matthew Quick
B0026Q8F6C|3.0|This movie is funny. In my opinion not for children but everyone probably already knew that.  The songs are are pretty funny.
B003WC5EQI|5.0|This is a good period film.  I enjoyed it.  I'd like to see more films like these.  This story has inspired many references in songs and other films.
B0054SMID0|5.0|The title of this short review was seen by yours truly in the restroom of a legal library long ago, and it is also colorfully characterized by \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\".<br />I really enjoyed this movie.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Excellent plot. Well thought out and kept me reading. Michael Connelly just keeps getting better and better. I can't waituntil the next Harry Bosch novel.
0307346617|5.0|If you are into the zombie genre you need to read this book.  The movie will be ok, but this is a phenomenal read.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|Threee stories up  to Connely's usual standards but too short to really involve the usual intrigue found in his Harry Bosch books.
B001UN1KVE|5.0|You are missing out on one of the most funny movies ever if you haven't seen this.  Sci Fi lover or not, you need this movie.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Got this free on a special ofer. Just like the original arcade game BUT tries hard to get you to buy upgrades before you can even start playing.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|While Stiller is funny in this, Robert Downey Jr. steals the show.  His performance alone is worth the watch.  This is a comedy that any film buff needs in their collection.
B0086700CM|4.0|This one of the many games that you can get for free -  However, If you get frustrated and want to buy power-ups and don't have enough coins, you can purchase more coins in differnt quantities for prices up to $20.  Power ups include Mega Coin (you can increase its value), Coin Magnet, Invisability (actually invulnerability) and Boost  (the invulnerable speeder) (all of which you can increase their active times) for more coins. WARNINGS: This game will actually increase your heart rate so don't play it for at least 2 hours before bedtime. Also you'll find it really frustrating at times because the path keeps changing and sometimes, even when you get really good, it will kill your runner (you can buy different runners but they don't seem to have any special powers) when you have to jump over a tree root and it puts a hole (broken segment) which you cant see right after or, puts 2 holes in a row ( you can make it over these but have to jump right from one edge to the other) or, puts an obstacle like a hole, tree or electrical arc right after a turn (If its a hole, it usually gives you the option to turn the other way). Did I mention that the runner goes faster and faster the farther he gets?  If you get really good at Temple Run, you can also get Temple Run 2 for free and really get frustrated. (You have to rock the Kindle side to side just to follow the CURVING path.)
B002HR1W1K|5.0|After rolling in the floor after watching Shaun of the Dead, I was excited for this movie.  You can never go wrong with a Simon Pegg comedy.  JUDGE BULLETS!!!
B0040I09RM|5.0|I have heard multiple alot about Sons of Anarchy, it is better than I even the best reviews could provide.  It's even better given it's available free with amazon prime streaming
B00386F0DA|4.0|In the mood for light romantic comedy?  For an hour or two of escape from thoughts of that project that hasn't been completed for the boss?  For a return to a time when you hadn't yet been smacked between the eyes with the reality of earning a living or raising your kids?  Just want to veg out for a while?  Here's the ticket:  three light-hearted movies with no bloodshed, no car chases, and no serious thought required.  Caveat:  the gentlemen will probably not appreciate these films as much as the ladies will.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This is a great movie.  I haven't seen the other oscar movies but I do believe this won best picture for a reason
B000MQ54OO|5.0|WITH THE BACKGROUND VOICES OF ENTERTAINERS, THIS FILM IS LOVABLE, WELL PLAYED, EMOTIONALLY EXCITED and SURELY A SCHOOL LESSON ON PENGUINS LIFE IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT.

B005BGBPBG|3.0|The book developed the characters very well. The movie had a hard time with this. Especially with Darcy and Rachael's relationship.  They tried to, but it wasn't enough to make a great movie.  It was enjoyable though.
B00821OX98|5.0|I only started watching Falling Skies because it was available via Amazon Prime.  I was semi-interested in the series before, but never got around to catching it on TV.  This first season was pretty solid, definitely better than I expected it to be... and I am watching season 2 now.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Involvement with these two characters became impossible.<br />There could not be a word of praise for the sick girl and her diary....and when her diary was revealed there could only be disgust at a mind so tarnished.<br />The idiocy of her husband both in the beginning and the end of the book added to my distaste with this novel.<br />I think the most serious review I can give is this:  Unfortunately, this novel ends with the opportunity for a &#34;formula seeking&#34; author to repeat the whole thing with different scenarios.  What a shame that other authors who bring a story to a climax, and then find another subject and inclination for a future book.  Dixl&#62;
B001AQR39O|4.0|Just as I expected, the crazy life of Hank and his family. Really enjoyed it just have to move on to the other seasons now.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love all Nicholas Sparks works  This was a very moving story and so true to many women who are abused every day, I am so glad Katie (Erin) found love and got away from that beast.  Good reading and great movie!
B009DA74ES|4.0|Happy I was able to find this product and get it finally. Just haven't had time to watch it yet.
B00065F86U|5.0|Kinda expensive for what it does (hold an EN-EL4a in the grip) and I can understand why Nikon wouldn't provide it with the grip since most probably wouldn't spend extra for a charger and EN-EL4a. I can stick an EN-EL4a in the grip by itself and it works fine until I shake the camera to get it loose. This little piece just holds the battery in place securely.<br />Bought BestDealUSA EN-EL4a for $16.67 and it works just fine. Unfortunately BestDealUSA doesn't have anymore availabe at the time of this review. I just chalk up the extra Nikon expense as a donation for their R&D so they can develop more pro and semi-pro level cameras
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Bought this for my grandchildren who love jake and he never land pirates and they absolutely loved this.  Of course had to buy a copy for granny's house too
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|My friend had this on her Tab1 and I thought it would work on my Kindle, unfortunately, it doesn't. I was really disappointed because my 2 yr old son loved playing this game on my friends Tab1 and I wish we could get it to work on the Kindle. =(
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Great characters and a bit of a wild ride, very entertaining. Really liked the style of the animation. Well worth watching.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is great! I have never been one to get into a TV series but I am hooked on Walking Dead!!
0345529057|5.0|As you probably already have heard, these books are absolutely among the best fiction ever written, period. It's got  the most complex characters, detailed worlds, and brilliant plot of any books I've ever read. This isn't merely a fantasy novel- it's a political, character study set in a brutal medieval fantastical world. Definitely worth reading!<br /><br />The box set is a great value. I have encountered no errors, the text is easy to read, and the books are sturdy and compact (well, considering their 1,000 page size). I'm kinda peeved that they didn't have a boxed set with the 5th book yet, but unless your willing to wait until October (which you shouldn't, given the amazingness of these books), this set will be more than suffice.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My grandchildren fight over my kindle! They live cut the rope and I love watching the older child teach the younger ones!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|It will be better if it did not have the poppy trial mode but me and my bro enjoy it:)
B005HED11Y|5.0|I've never watched a full episode or movie of Star Trek in my life until I saw the recent film. It piqued my interest and when I saw I could watch the original episodes in HD for Free (Amazon Instant Prime), I decided to see what all the hype was about.<br />I love it! As an engineer and geek, the show is great! Yes, it is corny and cheesy at parts, but for me that's what makes it so enjoyable. The overall quality of the film seems to be a step up from the original version (with some obvious new additions done in CG).<br />I would definitely recommend this to any newcomer to the Star Trek series.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I recommended this book for our Book Club to do because I really enjoyed it when I read it for the first time.  The book invoked so many different feelings of good and bad.  It shocked me on certain parts.  I also learned from it in regards to culinary aspect and restaurant business.  I learned some about food.  It had so many real characters that were fascinating that you will still see on TV or Food Network nowadays.  Most of our Book Club Members hated it because they found Anthony Bourdain to be arrogant.  Aren't famous chefs usually arrogant?  How about Gordon Ramsay, Emeril Lagasse, Bobby Flay, and the list goes on and on.  I like how Anthony Bourdain kept it real, and didn't try to cover up and make his life look pretty like a cake.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|An unexpected hero must find the fortitude to protect an innocent child from falling in to the clutches of the evil Queen Bavmorda in the fantasy adventure WILLOW, from 1988. Ron Howard directs based off of a story by George Lucas, which centers around the unassured dwarf, Willow, as he selflessly crosses miles of treacherous terrain and faces countless foes with the aid of a few unlikely allies. Despite his small stature, Warwick Davis becomes the embodiment of strength and courage as his journey transforms him into an honest hero. Val Kilmer stars beside him as the loud-mouthed thief, Madmartigan, who is given the chance to betray his instincts and fight for good. He is enjoyable, as well, if not overly eccentric. It is Jean Marsh that steals every scene, however, as Queen Bavmorda, the center of evil and corruption in this otherwise peaceful world. She is more frightening than any of the disfigured monsters that roam her wretched kingdom. The path to Tir Asleen presents many dangers, which are brought to life through the creative costuming by Barbara Lane and Industrial Light and Magic's Oscar-nominated effects. Each of the stunning exteriors transport us to a mystical world where these things can truly exist. WILLOW is undoubtedly a classic in the genre, and one that is filled with fantasy, adventure, and heart.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have loved reading Vince's books since I read the first one some years ago.  I subsequently bought all he had published as well as his latest books as soon as they became available.  Mitch Rapp is the &#34;heat&#34; in my mind and if only there were more like him, we might not have some of the current problems we face!!!  Vince's books are intriguing and grab you immediately.  Of course, you become engrossed and as badly as you want to know what's going to happen, you don't really want it to end.  I hear rumors there may be a movie made with Mitch Rapp as the protagonist!  If it is in the works, I hope the movie is equal to his books!!!  Keep up the outstanding work, Vince!
B0028IDXDS|4.0|Our baby likes the nipple on this paci, but it's not ideal for our infant.  Now that he's grabbing things he often pulls out the paci by tugging on the monkey.  Maybe he'll grow to hold it in his mouth as he gets older??  I don't know, but overall I still think it's a cute paci and it works most of the time.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Was up toll 3AM  Totally addicting game play. Simplistic strategy Beautiful music easy logical controls. It was free but we'll worth paying for.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Worth It. Very nice. Relaxing. Helps me sleep. Good for mornings too. Just about anytime. Anywhere. Promotes good vibe. Peace.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have loved all three books, hate to think that i do no not have a fourth Fifty Shades to continue the saga!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Awesome book! We all are looking for more time and don't realize how precious is the time we have. A must read by everyone who thinks they need time!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't not get enough of Christian and Ana!  I hate to put the book down,absolutley love, love, love! I am ready for the 3rd book!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Good to see everyone in the team is getting along well with each other.... to me all the seasons are of interest to me. My favorite character in the shows are: Agent . Morgan and Agent Brentice. Now again I also like the FBI Profiler too I think his a smart cookie..
B001DUGOWY|5.0|It wasn't Steinbeck's intention for this novel to be his last work of fiction, but harsh reception from critics, his publisher and editor made it so.<br /><br />Some of the criticism is understandable; the book is flawed in many ways that can be off-putting especially fans of &#34;classic&#34; Steinbeck, but the challenge here is to dig a little deeper.<br /><br />The morality play within is timeless which makes the novel timeless as well.<br /><br />A fitting end to a masterful career.  Steinbeck goes out swinging.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a really good game to play when you feel like pushing the limits and dont know what else to do. Great game.
B008X8QCTO|4.0|I enjoyed the 'creep' factor of this game, but on my tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab II), the puzzles were buggy and unplayable.  I had to wait to skip each of them, kind of a bummer.  Otherwise, really excellent artwork and a scary, compelling story.
B005LAII1C|1.0|This is a very raunchy movie. I am surprised Mark W. would even agree to do this movie. We watched enough of the movie to know it was not worth our time. I threw it in the trash can. Enough said.
142314189X|5.0|I bought this boxed set for my daughter and I to both enjoy.  She was enchanted that they came as a boxed set and excited at the cover art for each book jacket.  I loved that they have the library binding so they will stand up to years of use (and they will definitely be reread a lot).  The story is very engaging even for adults, and my daughter who is almost 10 really loves to follow along with the characters as they struggle and grow in the stories.  We both look forward to continuing the saga of Camp Half Blood with the next set of books once we finish this one, but will return to these books often as we do enjoy visiting old friends on occasion.
B008220DIC|4.0|The Master delivered. Very good movie. The actors were perfect for their rolls. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best I stay interested on the game I get yelled at because I love so much lol j should really get if its awsome
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everyone's talking about it, but I missed it when it showed originally.  I so appreciated being able to watch all the episodes for free with my Amazon Prime account, with no commercials!
B009XWD02G|3.0|It is great for someone who downloads a lot of music.  I'm an old timer and I prefer to listen to cd's, but I also have a hearing disability, that when I put headphones on, I cannot hear what else is going on around me when I have ear plugs in, but it is great!!!!!
B008RKGF1I|5.0|Watching Flashdance was a nice flash-back in time.  Watched the movie after seeing the touring Broadway show live.  Most enjoyable.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Love how the title comes about. Took a while for me to get into the book. But once I was halfway I couldn't put it down. I had to know what happened next. A bit predictable at times, but then you get a twist you weren't expecting.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|For fans of the show reading the books really enhances the experience. Highly recommended. The books are very character driven and give some additional context to major events from the series.
B003EYVXTG|4.0|I've not yet watched The Hunger Games, the concept is just to weird to think about.<br />Winter's Bone is also tough to observe the conditions under which they have to  survive. Ree is my latest hero. Imagine a seventeen year girl having to cope with the responsibility of taking care of her mother and siblings.<br />  Jennifer Lawrence is convincing as Ree, a young woman with a strong sense of family loyalty, and an intense understanding of her regional culture. When a hear a comment like \\"woman up\\", I feel that in this movie.<br />  When Ree saves the family property, I cheered. The supporting cast does a fantastic job.<br />  Would I watch it again? Not too soon--it's like seeing a terrible car accident<br />but you are compelled to get a look. Ironically, it does have sort of a happy ending.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|If you're looking for a free calculator app, this is your best bet. It's smooth, simple, and highly functional even for complex equations. The buttons are large and easy to identify, and your entire history is saved so you can always see what you've done. It is ad-supported, but it's only little banners at the top of the screen, nothing obnoxious like popups.<br /><br />So, for being free and emulating a real calculator so well, this gets my full recommendation.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book.  It is my favorite book. But it was the last one I read so it is my favorite. (Reference from the book) so I highly reccomend this book to anyone interested in any type of book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The book details feats of unimaginable human strength, endurance and courage. A must read! I can't wait to see the movie
B000FBJF7I|4.0|I enjoyed reading about the social, political, and environmental aspects of Africa which were woven between the detective work of Mma Ramotswe.  I didn't fully understand the philosophical ending though.  Perhaps it was a lead in for the next book.

B004JMY312|5.0|This was a good movie to watch (as opposed to some nutty TV show that doesn't make sense).  Bette Midler is always good at whatever she does, and this was just enough &#34;scary&#34; to make it fun.

B0082XJGRK|5.0|A practically perfect translation of this most human and personable Emperor.  Aurelius' musings and cautions more than merely stand the test of time; a man on a par with Benjamin Franklin of the Buddha or even the Christ.  To be read multiple times.
B000059GEH|4.0|It was a funny movie class to sit back and watch.  Marilyn Monroe was very entertaining in the movie. It is a shame she died so young.
B00B7XGFO4|3.0|not sure which, but it looked pretty bad even in taking the film's age in to account.  It was consistent also, so I doubt it was my bandwidth.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun to play.  My son begged me to get it for my kindle fire and has enjoyed it tremendously.
B00AHTYI5M|2.0|Wooden performances, cliche characters.  How could Affleck possibly take such a dramatic and interesting story and make it fall so flat?  Even John Goodman was flat, which is nigh-near impossible except with a rotten director.  Ben Affleck is not talented as a director.  The original Wired article is far more interesting than this film.
0525478817|4.0|Although this book has a stereotypical teenage romance story, The Fault in Our Stars shines with its uniqueness as it allows us to go on an adventure with two love struck cancer patients as they make the reader ponder the meaning behind life.<br /><br />Hazel Grace wanted to keep the people she'd hurt when the cancer inevitably took her life to a minimum. She and Augustus do fall in love. That's given away when you read the summary of the book. What wasn't expected was the tragedy that strikes these two, leaving one of these love struck characters to ponder the meaning of life with their lonesome.<br /><br />The one down side to this novel is the predictable aspect it has with the love story in it. From the beginning we know that Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters are going to end up falling in love. The thing about this novel is that Green tells this love story in such an interesting and unique way. He's able to paint the scenes in your head and the conversations that take between Hazel Grace and Augustus is captivating. These two love struck cancer patients come off as very mature. Because of their illness they have had to grow up quicker than other teenagers. They talk to one another as adults rather than children.<br /><br />Hazel Grace's tolerance with her whole cancer situation is remarkable. She knows that she is cursed with her illness. She understands her situation. She continues to go to school, already has her GED and is taking college classes at the age of 16. She handles her life as if cancer isn't going to just take her one-day. She's very relatable as well. As I read I would find myself empathizing with her as she went through her hardships in the book. She's actually funny too. The way she addresses her cancer situation is unique. \\"I didn't tell him that the diagnosis came three months after I got my first period. Like: Congratulations! You're a woman. Now die.\\"<br /><br />Augustus' way of always wanting to help others while no one can save him from hiscancer is striking. When he plays his favorite video game the one to save as many people as possible in a video game he plays. He tries his best even if it means that he will lose the game and all the points he has been working so hard to get.<br /><br />\\"I did some research on this a couple years ago,\\" Augustus continued. \\"I was wondering if everybody could be remembered. Like, if we got organized, and assigned a certain number of corpses to each living person, would there be enough living people to remember all the dead people?\\"<br />\\"And are there?\\"<br />\\"Sure, anyone can name fourteen dead people. But we're disorganized mourners, so a lot of people end up remembering Shakespeare and no one ends up remembering the person he wrote Sonnet Fifty-five about.\\" What 16-year-old boy sits down and thinks about these kind of things? Augustus' complex character does which is why the story in this book is so riveting.<br /><br />Throughout the book I was left to ponder life. When I first picked up this book I never imagined that it would leave me to sit and think about the meaning of my life. I feel that that is what makes the characters so relatable to. We all go through those feelings of \\"What is my purpose here? What am I going to do with my life? When I die, who will remember and care that I am gone?\\" These two complex yet unique and relatable characters are what will keep you flipping through the book swiftly. I can honestly say that no book has ever made me go into such depth with my thoughts.<br /><br />Green does an extraordinary job in writing this book. Green spent some time working with teenagers with cancer at children's hospital. From then he wanted to write about their experiences with cancer, but he couldn't do so without sounding self-indulgent and sentimental. That was until he was able to write The Fault in Our Stars. Not only does he write a story filled with teenage romance and makes us think about life. He gives us a peek into what life is like for a teenager with cancer. They go through things the way healthy people do, they are just stronger than most because they have a heavy baggage to carry around with them through everything they do. Although someone without cancer will never truly know what their life is like, this book allows us to get a bit of understanding of how life with cancer is.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.\\"<br />-John Green<br /><br />This book is one of those books.

B0094K1MH2|5.0|Surprised by the journey and calling back memories of \\"Indiana Jones,\\" this was a fun movie for our family (ages 9-15) to watch.<br /><br />Beginning in a public market, a young man purchases a beautiful three-mast model ship.  Immediately, he's offered a princely sum ... yet, the young investigative reporter (and his small dog) fall upon a 100 year old story of sunken Spanish treasure.<br /><br />With swash-buckling sailors, freighters in open sea, an eclectic pick-pockets, and bumbling constables from Scotland Yard, this was indeed a surprise movies that slipped under the radar.<br /><br />I'm glad that we found it!

B007N5YIUS|5.0|I came late to this series of games but I was immediately hooked on the Angry Birds game when I got it.  Angry Birds Space is a worthy sequel to the original.  As I understand, it was created by people who work for NASA and that shows in a lot of little details--my husband who worked at Goddard Space Flight Center is fascinated by how the details of orbital mechanics and other space science was translated  into the game.  Lots of fun and scientifically accurate as well!
0385493800|5.0|I read this as a part of a reading club. I enjoyed the book, and I might even read it again sometime in the future.
B000FGG60W|1.0|I'm sure I would have loved this movie, but the disc that claimed to be &#34;the sound and look of perfection&#34; didn't even play in any of my devices: a brand new blu-ray player, another higher quality blu-ray player, or even my desktop computer. I got a great deal on the movie, so I'd actually lose money by trying to return it. Be careful who you buy things from, even if it is Amazon.

B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|This show keeps getting better as time goes on. I have now watched the entire series 3 times and I have never been disappointed.
032147404X|3.0|I read the rave reviews here on Amazon for Scott Kelby's The Digital Photography Book, so admittedly had high expectations for it. Unfortunately, it didn't really match up. I'm still debating whether to return it. Kelby's books in this series are each organized as a collection of tips, tricks, recipes, and other insights grouped thematically by chapter. Each tip/trick/recipe is contained on just one page. Kelby's approach is to strictly tell you how--like you're out together at a shoot, and ask him how to do something, his response wouldn't be a dissertation on the fundamentals of photography (the \\"why\\"), but just a quick \\"do this, this, and this, but avoid that\\" (the \\"how\\").<br /><br />So, the good: There actually are some really interesting and useful gems buried in the book. For example, the recommendation to turn off Vibration Reduction or Image Stabilization if you're using a tripod was new to me (or maybe it was just never really prominent in the other photography books I've read), how to apply for permits to use tripods in some indoor locations like museums, and the suggestions for taking photos of newborn babies (really, this seemed a lot like common sense after reading it--BUT I'm not sure it would have occurred to me if I hadn't seen it spelled out explicitly). You can read the book straight through, skim it, or really just review the Table of Contents (which is excellent in its level of detail) when there's a specific kind of tip or insight you're seeking. The recipes for producing specific kinds of shots/photos are also pretty helpful--IF you happen to be interested in the dozen or so specific shots included.<br /><br />The bad: Most of the info in here can be found in other, far more useful books; if you own a few good ones (like [[ASIN:0817432256 Bryan Peterson's Understanding Photography Field Guide]]), then this book is superfluous. A lot of the tips are common sense (\\"don't change lenses in dusty areas\\"--really? you wasted an entire page telling me that?). Kelby's awkward sense of humor, especially in the chapter openers, can be grating at times. The tips don't really seem to gel together as a collection. For example--some tips will really rehash stuff that's clearly targeting people brand new to DSLR photography (like the VR/IS tripod tip, or the don't change your lens in dust tip), but others seem to be more appropriate for people who are the very advanced \\"amateurs\\" contemplating taking the plunge into pro photography, or who are just starting out in the business of photography. The back cover clearly describes this book as \\"USER LEVEL Beginner\\"; so why do beginners need an entire chapter on how to shoot a wedding? Some of the tips could easily be reframed so that they aren't wedding specific and could fit in the other chapters in the book. But how many \\"beginners\\" will be shooting a wedding? Write a book for beginners, or write a book that provides practical business advice for aspiring professionals, but don't try to combine the two. And many of the tips in the book basically boil down to this: use a tripod. Want your photos tack sharp? Use a tripod. Want to shoot people like a pro? Use a tripod. Want to shoot a great landscape? Use a tripod? Looking to capture that perfect sports moment? Use a tripod. If there's a way to restate this one tip, Kelby finds it.<br /><br />Many of the tips are very equipment intensive; for example, many of the tips on taking photos of people like a pro focus on using reflectors or buying the right backdrops. They make sense, but again, really aren't what I'd expect in a book targeting beginners. Realistically, how many beginners plan to set up a portrait studio in their home? There's just a general lack of awareness about his audience. More usefully, peppered throughout Kelby sometimes makes recommendations on equipment. Where possible, he provides a \\"budget friendly\\" option, a pro option, and the \\"money is no object, best in class\\" option. In concept, this is really helpful. What's amusing is how frequently the \\"budget\\" option is not really all that budget friendly. For example, his budget tripod is $100; surely there's one he's willing to recommend that comes in closer to $50 or $70? For a true beginner, $100 on a tripod is probably not the best use of their limited photography budget.<br /><br />So, the verdict? For me, this book is a complete wash. I will probably return it, since (for me) there's not enough good to outweigh the meh. I do think the approach is promising, as is the one-tip-per-page format, but the execution here was pretty poor. If you're on the fence, try flipping through the Table of Contents to see if the different tips interest you. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this book unless you know for certain that it contains tips on specific topics of interest to you..

1595828753|5.0|Definitely a great read for ATLA and LOK fans. If you're new to the series, I don't recommend it, simply because it picks up right where the first series left off. You don't want to spoil it for yourself! :)

B002NVTSGQ|5.0|I found out about this show and am now buying all the previous ones so I can catch up! It's great, and really funny. Although there are many conservative people who are turned off by anything other than the traditional family, the reality is that American families come in all flavors, configurations, etc. This includes blended families and gay couples raising children (who sometimes would have languished in orphanages or foster care if not adopted). This show has a great cast and I am having so much fun watching it. I am still only on Season 1. I got sick and was confined to bed, so I bought the whole season to occupy myself. Now I just get on and watch an episode instead of searching for something on TV- although I understand that this is on TV now. Love it!!! Can't figure out who is the best cast member!!!

So how can I complain about a free little video? I wasn't interested in just getting a trailer, but supposedly the film is quite good, and if I want to buy that, I can. No complaints, I'm just reviewing it because Amazon asked me too. :)  And if you like trailers, no problem; it's free!

B00BESIKWM|5.0|this movie is great! really sticks to the source material (silent hill 3 ps2). it covers everything really well and only veers from the original sparingly. the budget was a little low but so what? it still looks pretty great and the budget issue only shows glaringly once or twice. the other thing is the acting is odd, this is because all the main characters are english or australian pretending to be american, so their speech sounds stilted just because they're masking their accents and trying to mimic american speech patterns.<br /><br />other than that it's gold. for a long time lover of the games this will please. they definitely kept it true for the fans! they even brought back in the idea of the silent hill people trying to resurrect their \\"god\\", which was left out of the first one for some reason. the only real divergence form the source is the large part given to and the exact nature of the people trying to resurrect the \\"god\\". in the game they're super vague and their position a little different. however they have reconciled them a little more true to the game since the first movie where they were totally different.<br /><br />the ending is hilariously bad, that much i can say, but it's a thirty second scene and it's fun while still being really ridiculous. then there's a shameless tie in of a bunch of different things to cap up the movie which is also ridiculous, but a fan will just smile because of how many ideas they cram into the last 60 seconds or so! it's like \\"oh i know what that is! ah! that's from this one! ha ha, they even brought in [blank, no spoilers ;)] and got his/her name right!\\" and so on. for a non gamer it might be kind of cheesy... or more like super cheesy, but for someone used to the stilted and odd dialogue of the game series it's nothing new.<br /><br />i think there must have been a scene planned of nurse vs a certain monster (again no spoilers) because it shows a still model that the camera swings around in the credits. must have gotten cut for time or something, shame because it would have been epic!!!<br /><br />another thing:<br /><br />all those who say this and the first film are not true to the games: compare them to the resident evil series!!!!<br /><br />the first RE movie is about 20% true to the games. the third and after are about 5%. (the second film is an exception and is really similar to the games but one out of five movies does not tip the scales so i'm omitting it for this argument).<br /><br />silent hill one is about 70% true to the games, and silent hill revelations is about 80% true to the games!<br /><br />RE just wanted to own the rights to make movies that they could sell using the name recognition of the games.<br /><br />silent hill clearly is much more dedicated to creating movies that are relatively true to the games! give them a break!ten cut for time or something, shame because it would have been epic!!!<br /><br />another thing:<br /><br />all those who say this and the first film are not true to the games: compare them to the resident evil series!!!!<br /><br />the first RE movie is about 20% true to the games. the third and after are about 5%.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|I owned a small Lowepro bag previously.  My problem with it now was that I wanted to carry my camera, 2nd lens, and all my flashes(4 of them) with me in one bag.  I use this when I take my equipment to photoshoots to keep it separate from my bulkier lighting equipment.<br /><br />Stuff I'm able to stuff into it: Canon Rebel 600D(T3i), 18-135mm Lens, 50mm Lens, 4 canon Speedlite flashes, camera battery charger, 32 AA batteries, spare camera battery, and sync cables(2 lengths).<br /><br />Now there isn't a lot of room left after all that, but seeing as I stuffed 4 flashes into it, and everything fits nicely, while not being too tight or moving around within the included separators, I believe this bag will give plenty of space for most hobbyists/prosumers.<br /><br />My only problem with it, is the lack of holes on the zippers to put a tiny lock on. This may be a concern if you want to use this for general walkabout/street photography.  However, if you are doing street photography, you don't to look that assuming most of the time anyway.<br /><br />If you want a bag that you can throw into your car trunk and go with enough space that you most likely won't forget something because it didn't fit at some point down the line, this is your bag.  For the price, it almost can't be beat.

Yes, sometimes she picks books from the library that are not as much of a joy to read. I ordered this to remedy that, to be able to insert a little geeky humor into her life and to make the bedtime book selection just that much more palatable. Imagine my surprise when she kept requesting this one over and over and over again. I haven't gotten tired of it and neither has she.

B00B23O96A|1.0|Well ... I am a huge Clapton fan ... Saw him with Cream back in the day, Blind Faith, Delaney & Bonney yadah yadah yadah .... but what is this? Come one Eric!?!?!? Do you really think people are going to like this? I just can't believe I bought this but that will teach me to wait and first listen to the samples rather than save a few cents with a pre-order.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It gives you a true and sometimes humorous look at the work of the warriors we put in the face of war and the constraints they are held to.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Love it! It makes my life easier. If your phone has voice command, you just push the button and say the command. It calls whoever I want to call, reads my text messages out loud and replies. The only thing is that when it gets hot in the car, it takes a while to pair up with my phone, but I think it still deserves 5 stars.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book. It really taught me about survival, and the life and death theme. Especially on a boat..WITH A TIGER! Would definitely recommend.
0525478817|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2TMNKGOSDKEJO]]The main characters in the book - Hazel & Augustus - were captivating. The book deals with a tough subject (cancer in kids), exposes life in one of its rawest forms, yet celebrates our humanity & individuality. The only negative part is that the book had to end!!<br /><br />Christine Brown-Quinn<br />Author of Step Aside Super Woman
B00457X7IQ|5.0|I originally saw these books at Big W, then when coming out of the cinema when seeing Wreck It Ralph saw the movie posters and thought I must get those books to read.<br /><br />I loved the story, got me hooked pretty well straight away. I bought all four straight away and just worked my way through them, they kept me wanting to know more and then I had to know how they all finished.  Thoroughly enjoyed all 4 book and will more than likely read them again.
B009G41CG2|4.0|Really like the game MahJong, but like the original tiles better, just wasn't an option this time.  Just have to focus more on the tiles to match.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I am extremely upset with the fact that I paid $2.99 for the game and then I was only able to play one level. What kind of crap is that?
B00B7G23KQ|2.0|This film was only moderately entertaining, yet another series that should have ended a few movies ago. Wait for it to be on prime so you don't have to spend any money.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was every bit a page turner as the first book. The characters are all loveable. The only thing that I didn't bloke were that there were a lot of unanswered questions, about different scenarios. The author is a true romantic.
B0093ICOJ0|5.0|I enjoy watching Batman for many years since I was young. I know the batman theme has change over the years and now I am a man and watch the new Batman movies at the theatre, I still like watching the animated movies and series. I enjoy seeing Batman fighting the baddies, like the Joker or Penguin.  And I see the character change with new actors playing the part of Batman in each movie. The story is different in this movie since it has mutant leader, a different look of two face and many others.  I guess we all get older and want to enjoy the things we like in life. Batman is still the one as well as Superman as the most love heroes. It is nice to remember when you was young and enjoy watching Batman on TV the animated version of the 1990s or the 70s (Dare to remember that)!!!<br />I wish they would not change too much in the style and look of the superhero that we all love.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|intriguing about how they captured/killed the terror of the world. good read. hard to put down. good for anyone who enjoys a good military/historical read.
0446580848|5.0|Love his humor this book as all his books are great! Excellent book as well as the past books. I enjoy the plot, story line and of course the signature sense of humor of John Corey.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|its very convient and works to charge apple products nt kindle you should not tell people they can use any other charger for kindles besides the real kind;e chargers
B007TUAHVQ|1.0|The box shows a purple covenant on the cover, but it comes with a red one inside....Kids hate things like this because thats the main reason they pick toys. Mainly because of the pictures showing them whats inside or what they think should be inside. As a mother I do not think this should happen at all. Children are obviously visual and this kind of thing upsets them. Not to menton puts a dent in my wallet for something he already had. So do what u have to do to fix these kinds of mistakes. Because it just shouldn't happen EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
B007S6NLV4|4.0|The problem with all the Harry Potter movies is that each movie would be 4-6 hours long if they conveyed everything from the book.  The books were excellent and I thought the first 3 movies were great.  The 4th book was so long that the movie could not show everything.  The 5th & 6th movies were good and the Deathly Hallows part 1 & 2 were good but again the movie could no convey everything from the book.  These movies are not meant for young children as they will be scared.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Fast shipping and cute movie.  Son has enjoyed watching it in the car on long trips.  Would def recommend for long car rides.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Lee Child is a very talented writer, however Jack Reacher's character does not strike home with me.  I hate to criticize Child, but I suspect this is very personal and subjective.  I enjoy his other books.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|This is you basic &#34;found footage&#34; horror film. It definitely lifts ideas from other recent films, like Paranormal Activity.  One thing I found to be annoying is that the characters never think to turn on the lights when weird, paranormal stuff is happening to them in their own house!
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Preston & Child are not very good writers in my opinion, but they can spin a yarn better than 90% of the very good writers today.  If you enjoy reading for pure storytelling acumen, the Pendergast series are for you - get all three of this series today.
B0039YZPZ4|4.0|If you like Guy Richie directed movies, then this is one you'll also enjoy.  Definitely not the thinking person's Holmes.  Mostly humor and action, which can be good sometimes.
B000SVZIGC|4.0|Don Bluth's films are very much hit or miss, but while this doesn't quite hit the same heights as Secret of NIHM or An American Tail it is still a very beautiful, enjoyable picture. One of the problems with the film is that the animation, while fluid, tends to be a bit on the stilted side. Often the characters feel like they're stuck on a small soundstage without a lot of room to move around, even when they have huge environments to move around in. This becomes especially noticeable in the final action scenes at the end.<br /><br />The film also doesn't have quite the &#34;epic&#34; feel that a tale like this really needs, in part because of the pacing and editing. A mere minute or two more added to the film to throw in a few more lines here and there explaining character motivations and giving some of the scenes time to breathe would have gone a long way. And other than &#34;A Rumor in St. Petersburg&#34; the visuals in the musical numbers tend to be a little more bland than they should be. &#34;In the Dark of the Night&#34; is especially infamous for this. The visuals aren't nearly as interesting, inventive, or captivating as the song itself (which is, in my opinion, by far the highlight of the soundtrack).<br /><br />The music itself tends to be fairly forgettable, but I fault this on the aforementioned animation rather than the songs themselves. I found &#34;Journey to the Past&#34; especially boring the first time I watched the film, to the point where I actually gave up watching the movie and didn't come back to finish until years later. But listening to the same song later by itself on the soundtrack I really enjoyed it! It's a pity so many of the songs came across as so forgettable because they're really pretty catchy and should have been far more memorable than they ended up being in the film.<br /><br />All in all, this movie could have been so much better, but it still managed to get stuck in my head. There's something to say for a movie that's able to stick with you despite its faults. It'll probably get many more viewings from me in the future.ick with you despite its faults. It'll probably get many more viewings from me in the future.
B003UBTX72|4.0|Sure, Keith gives you his take on all the drug busts, romances, and tragedies. But more importantly, he gives you a window into his songwriting process. A fantastic read.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Quite possibly the most interesting book I have ever read!!!  A must read for anyone interested in science fiction.  Highly recommended!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It keeps me occupied. I've played pc games like this before and this is just as fun, if not more.
B00ANW33CM|3.0|Well, as far as games go, it is something else to do. I see not much reason to be rating a game but these ratings things clog my inbox
B008JGSM6G|4.0|An addicting gmae that I could play for hours. My husband and two kids (ages 5 and 7) enjoy this game too.
B000VHVGM8|5.0|Hang on to your hats, gang.  This kicky romp through London will give you a smile a minute.  Sexy, (Jamie Lee), campy (her mentally skewed boyfriend), and goofy (2 of Monty Pyton's guys), this is based of a jewel heist that goes ... well, let's just say it goes.  A bit of &#34;button, button, who has the button&#34;. You could almost say it's Brit Com Slapstick but it's more thab that.  Watch it and see for yourself.  I think you'll enjoy it.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I am a huge fan of the movies and the books and this will go down as one of the best Bond films of the series!
B005H9B44A|3.0|Dark, violent, body shredding.  Oh, yeah!  Disobediance to the rules/law, argumenitive with parent, headstrong child...  An Action movie with costumes.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|Shipment was excellent  package is unusual I've been thinking about getting this for years.  And I still like it at 2013<br />I kind of hope they make more of these movies with new technology
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series is amazing.  The acting and scenery are spectacular.  The story lines and writing are wonderful.  I recommend watching season 1 and 2 first.  Fans of Jane Austen will love this show.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely.  I love books that are wrritten from diffierent character's perspectives - it allows the reader to develop a better understanding of the complex personalities involved in the story.  A very good read indeed!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Even though this is a kids movie, I found it to be very entertaining, funny, visually stunning, and have a good moral behind it. I am 17 and watching this made me think back to all the memories I had as a kid. This movie has the best theme out of all the Disney movies I've seen. I recommend this to anybody who either loves Disney or is just looking for a very good movie to watch.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|It not that good but it is okay to look up something fast that you wanted t look at on Google.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just a fun show to watch. My favorite character is Lady Violet. I am looking forward to them leaving the Great War and entering the 20's.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This review will appear at My Secret Romance Book Review<br /><br />Choices.<br />Lies.<br />Secrets.<br /><br />Our lives are made up of choices. The choices we make. The choices others make. Then come the lies and the secrets about those choices. All of these things conspire to shape our lives whether we want them to or not.<br /><br />The choices made by Sky, Holder and her mom change Sky's life forever. The lies and the secrets they keep about those choices will shatter her.<br /><br />Sky is 17 years old and she's been homeschooled her entire life. She finally talks her mom into letting her go to public school for her senior year. It's that decision that changes her life forever. She meets Dean Holder. Resident bad boy. Only he's not the bad boy everyone makes him out to be. He's just.....misunderstood.<br /><br />Dean Holder is feels he's hopeless. He's let two people down in his life and he's scared to death he's going to let someone else down. So, he holds himself back. Only he can't hold himself back from Sky. She speaks to him in a way no one else has. He's connected to her. She's connected to him.<br /><br />Sky and Holder's relationship took me back to high school. With all the horrors and joys that only adolescence can bring. The horrors of the cruelty of high school kids. The joys of that first kiss, first touch, first date. It took me back to sneaking off to find a place to make-out, and finally ending up making out in the front seat of a car. And then there's the emotional angst of boyfriends. Men are so moody when they're teenagers, all those hormones!<br /><br />I made the mistake of starting this book in the late afternoon. I say this was a mistake because I couldn't stop reading until I finished it...at 3:00 AM!!!! I was riveted. I had to know what lies and secrets Holder was keeping from Sky. When I finally found them ALL out, I was shocked! But the biggest shock wasn't Holder's lie and secret. It was another one. One that left me speechless. And the person who held that lie and that secret made it all that much worse.<br /><br />I felt the rage and despair that Sky felt. Then when all the lies and secrets were out there, I felt Holder's as well. What doesn't kill us will only make us stronger. So they say.
B008CRC506|5.0|It was the best and I'm still enjoying Smash, can't wait to see  all of season 2.  Love Katharine McFee and Megan Hilty.  And the premise.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|This is definitely more adult humor.  I love Seth.  If you get a chance to how they made the film, it is really interesting.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I believe this book is very informative,  and how a child learns as a result to their individual environment. This book is useful as a psychology student, but as a parent. The book really makes you think.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Even if you are not in to musicals, you will laugh out loud with this movie.  Silly, funny, lighthearted and a great distraction.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's easy and convenient, I have access to weather 24/7. Therefore I don't have to wait for  the news on TV to get info about the weather.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I have seen this movie/documentary many times.  My roommate had not seen or heard of it.  I had her watch it without letting her know the subject matter.  She loved it.  I've had other family and friends watch it when I find out they have never seen it before.  It is really eye opening to the phenomenon that is on-line/virtual dating.  People can say and be whomever they want.  Now with the MTV show, it is disturbing just how often this occurs.  You tend to feel empathetic and sympathetic for both parties involved.  The Internet has opened up a new world for those that are shy, insecure about their looks, lonely, struggling in some way.  Unfortunately, it also brings some frauds that are out to steal and prey on those people.  It happened to me 3 years ago on an on-line dating site.  Be careful out there...
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is actually the first game I've written a review of, because most of them lose my interest so quickly I feel weird writing a review that says 'I played this twice, got bored, and quit'. This one is not that. It's not trying to get me to buy something right off the bat, it's fun and challenging and still quick to play, and it has a good soundtrack. I approve!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Very entertaining.  Even though you kind of knew how it was going to play out, the author kept it very interesting and you had to know how it ended.  The devotion to the Eagles NFL team by the family was hilarious!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Pleased to hear some more of Jimi Hendrix. Hard to believe his music is 40+ years old. Definitely his guitar work along with concert sounding deep bass. One can only reminisce of his greatness and wonder what may have been possible with technology improvements since back then. It was a sad day when he died and becomes even sadder when wondering what we all missed with his passing. RIP Jimi
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is aaawwweeesssooommmeee. it is awesome because you don't have to turn and tilt your device unlike temple run. gggeeettt iiittt
B00B23O96A|5.0|A very relaxing CD. Wish it had a few more uptempo selections. Great listening to an artist who has truly aged gracefully. Well established for his guitar talent and mastery for decades. Just needed one closing blistering solo performance to remind us just how wonderful and special an artist he is, would have bench marked another moment along his life journey.
0756405890|3.0|Viewed as a Harry Potter like, rags to riches children's story, this book is a lot of fun.  It's major short-comings are that it is that the book is far too long for it's plot and that it makes very awkward and ham-fisted attempts to introduce a romance between the main character and a girl exactly like him.  These two things nearly ruin the book, but overall I liked it
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This was an enjoyable and uplifting book, detailing one man and his family journey through an illness that rightly should have killed him.  It can be considered a true miracle of science and spiratuality.
159102594X|3.0|I really like J.A.'s other novels, but this one really did not click for me.  The pacing is slow, the characters are sort of dull, and the drama feels forced.  Fortunately, this book appears to be the exception.  Skip it and head straight to Red County
0452289963|5.0|One of the best books you could read to get in touch with your self your thoughts and feelings.  I highly recommend it.
0756407125|2.0|The series started out alright.  Good story (if not a bit winded), good dialogue, decent characterization (by fantasy standards this is high praise).  This book, the follow-up to The Name of the Wind, is not good however.  Instead of expanding on the interesting universe hinted at in the first novel, this book is solidly a puff-piece written about the main character.  All the annoying bits of Ready Player One expanded into 700+ page novel.<br /><br />The first book had promise and I was hoping that the story would get more interesting.  Nope.  Only fan service here.  Oh well
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince is a great story teller!  Interesting characters - good story line and easy to follow.  Will buy another of his books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Twists and turns on every page.  You will want to read it in one sitting and pass it on to friends.  Just don't be a spoiler and give it away!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|After I watched Season 1 on my Kindle, I had to immediately start Season 2!  So wrapped up in the characters!
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|Saw movie in the 3D in new 48fps. while it was a bit weird looking after a half hour I became accustomed to it. But I do not think it presents any improvement in movies and actually makes it harder to suspend disbelief due to cognizance of the CGI.<br /><br />As the for the vision of the story, I was disappointed. I think if the original director had stayed we would have a much better movie just for a \\"different\\" experience. I feel The Hobbit by Jackson brought nothing new. You could have have picked it all out of deleted scenes from LOTR. Scenery, action, presentation must have come from the same story boards as LOTR. The dwarves look weird. Nothing as good as 'Gimli' and they are not near as interesting. The song in Bilbo's house is just stupid...did Jackson get Disney's Snow white dwarves confused?<br /><br />All in all, the movie was good...not great like ALL of the LOTR movies. Jackson's un-creative deviations from Tolkien's real story to stretch the series to three movies (a simple money grab) are nonsense just like his \\"non-story\\" changes in LOTR (eg: skull avalanche, Saruman's death, and no battle for the Shire).<br /><br />Note: the 3D was nothing special and often not experiential. So I don't think I will pay the extra for the 3D bluray. Also, Jackson ALWAYS SCREWS US BY RELEASING THE EXTENDED VERSION A HALF YEAR LATER. WHY PAY FOR LESS? So I will wait and maybe the added scenes will improve the plot!
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|Another great performance by Jennifer Lawerence, however the plot was not as captivating as I had hoped for.  Nice twist though.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Ford is always enjoyable, but this story really engaged me. Great characters, completely believable details.  I highly recommend Richard Ford's Canada.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is beast got it first day and I'm at the third shark wonder how they came up with this one
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and Nicholas Sparks as an author. I have recently went and watched the movie version of Safe Haven and I did enjoy that as well, but the book was better. In fact, I have began reading another book by Sparks.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|I have been a fan of Boz Scaggs since the early 1970's when he was a blues player. This album covers a wide range of material and even taps into his early blues roots. His unique vocals are prevalent but not redundant. As always, his guitar work is excellent. I bought this the day it came out if for no other reason than an expression of loyalty to the Boz brand. There is always some risk in buying music from an older artist who does not put out a lot of albums. This album puts away any such concern. It is solid musically and in the song selection. It is not as &#34;produced&#34; as Silk Degrees or Down Two the Left, but is on par with those works.
B008I43DYU|1.0|As before, did nor receive, so ordered a different app. . . . . . . . . ... .
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I've been following David Bowie since 1973, so I guess you could say I'm a longtime fan.<br /><br />So what to make of \\"The Next Day\\"?<br /><br />I've been reading the published reviews and comments here and elsewhere. After the first rush of \\"It's Brilliant\\" came the \\"It's Pretty Good\\"s with a few \\"Not Really That Good\\"s. This is entirely typical for a response to a Bowie album and it was just the same in the 1970s, the supposed golden era for Bowie. Some albums of that period, e.g. \\"Aladdin Sane\\", \\"Pin Ups\\", \\"Diamond Dogs\\", \\"Low\\", received hostile reviews at the time. Strongly hostile in some cases. So don't pay too much mind to what people are saying today. Listen to the record for yourself. More than many other artists, Bowie requires multiple listens. That might seem odd as so many of his songs seem instantly attractive, but the best Bowie always contains wheels within wheels. Unusual sonic details, unsettling modulations and key changes, rhythmic arrests - they are all present in his best work, and they are present here.<br /><br />I've played this album maybe twenty five times. Songs I dismissed on one hearing emerge strongly on another. Strange details continue to emerge out of the mixes, that are an often artful blend of unusual guitar and keyboard textures designed to produce an initial attractive surface sheen but, presented differently, could be as jarring as a Sonic Youth recording. Saxophone is often used as a textural instrument, subverting the usual rock sax clichés. Even Earl Slick's most obvious rock riffing is twisted and subverted by the song structures.<br /><br />I'm not going to go through this record song by song. Certain tracks, the first four for example, hit me hard on first listen and remain just as powerful. Others seemed slight on first acquaintance - \\"Dancing Out In Space\\", \\"The Boss Of Me\\" for example - but grew stronger as my familiarity increased. Not all the material is equally good, but this is true of any Bowie album. What is different about this album in relation to the post-1970s work is the degree to which I have become involved in it. It's the first Bowie album in decades that has me repeatedly listening to it, finding myself remembering lyric excerpts and humming tunes. This, as far as I'm concerned, is enough for me to call this a first class David Bowie album.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What a great read. I have never read a John Green novel before but I am a new fan. Heartbreaking and a page turner.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This book was just one of those that u cannot put down and so excited to get back to.  The best I have come across for a while!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's a great way to kill time on the Kindle Fire.  The graphics are pretty amazing.  I don't doubt that they are even better on a device with a higher spec'd processor or an HD display.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was great! I really liked the book.  I hope that there will be more books made because all the books are good
B002KVZBGA|5.0|I liked it much better than the remake that was done. I've always been a fan of Michael Caine's work too
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly keeps me turning pages to find what Harry  Bosch is going to do next and what he is going to say and do. Really enjoy Connelly's writing style and character development. I have read every Harry Bosch novel he has written and am really pleased when I find a new one to read. Wish he could write faster!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I have been a fan since the show first started. So happy to be able to watch my favorites over and over. Then again, all my favorites. &#34;Live long and prosper&#34;
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Loved this book. Such an extraordinary story. I can't wait to see the movie. I would recommend this book to anyone
B005UBNKWO|2.0|I have been waiting for other parts to finish the computer that I have been working on.  When I opened the box with the fan, I noticed that the plastic around it was broken and I have since discovered that the fan doesn't work on the heatsink.  This item is supposed to have a three year warranty.  Please send me a replacement.
B003U51D58|5.0|Loved watching all 6 seasons, one episode after the other, on my Amazon Kindle Fire.  The instant play feature is great.  The show itself was a study in confusion, but I still enjoyed it for its entertainment value.
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|It took to long to get into the story.we need details but really can I say overkill. The story was heartbreaking.
B0063IH60K|2.0|this is a rated G game which I have enjoyed for many years. I was repelled by the rated X advertisement,had to turn kindle Off to get off that site
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much!!!:):):) it is really fun and now its in Rome now. I want to have this game forever.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|The rules of this game are simple but it isn't easily mastered.<br /><br />You are an orb that tries to get as big as possible.<br />To do so, you have to absorb smaller orbs.<br />You propel yourself by tapping near your orb which gives it a shove from behind.<br />Touch any orb with your own that's smaller and you will grow.<br />If it's bigger, you lose.<br /><br />Tranquil space music accompanies your quest.
1455508977|5.0|As with all of this authors book, he keeps one completely lost in the reading.  Taking you right into seemingly, as though you were participating.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm so glad to have found this book through a recommendation on one of Amazon's forums. It's not the type of book that I usually go for, but I absolutely loved it and will seek out more of this author's work.<br /><br />Well-developed, likable, intelligent characters, and a strong plot that kept me reading late into the night.<br />Really nicely written!<br /><br />But slight **SPOILER**, there was one scene towards the end that was a bit brutal for me in terms of gore, but it wasn't so off-putting that I didn't finish the book (because I had to know how it ended). It may be truly upsetting for those with experience surrounding suicide.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is a great 007 movie and if you have any of the other ones you will want to get this one. Daniel Craig is very good in this movie and the action is ongoing with a great story line.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|Mostly the shows have been very good in Season 5. A couple have been dull, but not like Season 4, which I found 60% of to be a waste of time.
1933784032|5.0|I love this book. Visually it is everything I hoped for. That said, It was a pity to see a glaring error early on in the book - on one page, the Millennium Falcon is referred to as an Imperial Star Destroyer...oh well, I guess the typography wasn't  completed by a Star Wars geek.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this Star Wars geek thinks it's an outstanding read.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I have become incredibly fond of this series. The characters and plot just have a whole lot of heart, and the scenery throughout is unbelievably beautiful. It's the kind of show that you look forward to curling up to watch with a cup of tea or bowl of ice cream--a delightful escape to a slower, gentler world. However, it's definitely not a show for people who like faced-paced dramas or soap operas. If you enjoy BBC period dramas (Pride and Prejudice, 1995; Wives and Daughters, North and South, Cranford, Bleak House, Downton Abbey, etc.), I imagine you will enjoy this series.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|If you have heard of Firefly, and are curious about it, it is definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it only ran for one season...so by the end of the season there are a lot of plot lines (and back stories) that are left as loose ends.<br /><br />I suppose that since the most negative thing that I have to say about this series is that I want more of it, is why I gave it 5 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE NOTE:  There is a follow up movie to Firefly, which is called \\"Serenity\\".  This movie does resolve a lot of the loose ends that I mention.<br />IF you watch Firefly, you must also watch Serenity.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Granted, I only paid 99 cents plus tax for this, but it is not nearly as fun as the free one, its just prettier to look at.  I'd rather play the one that is more challenging and has more games.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Well worth a read. I have 94% of this book read and am enjoying every page. It has everything, action, treachery, loyalty and black humour. The only problem is trying to remember the names and who is who, but the X-ray  feature on the Kindle resolves this issue. I have already bought books 2 and 3 and intend to buy the rest of this epic saga. If a good, well written story floats your boat, then I thoroughly recommend this series.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|lots of ones to do, they always seem different and they are all challenging which is what makes the game enjoyable.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Amazing app great for listening to music or downloading your  favorite music as mp3 or download the video for later times or just for saving when your not around WiFi its an excellent application and since it's you tube you can find any music you want unlike a music downloading app which are all very limited and not very good...this app has it all and leaves all other music or video applications in the dust..
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|not sure why this has such good reviews but I'm here to tell you it blows chunks maybe I am the stupid one. but I really think this app sucks and no point to the game .
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I'm 11 and my friends at school dared me to play this game and holy slender I was scared you will find out if you just press download
B006M4F67A|5.0|I like this program because I like playing Mahjongg anyway.  I like the effects and how the program is made.  This is a program that you play for hours!
B0091REZMW|3.0|The hidden objects are hard to see, and should be played with a stylus, or your hand is covering the objects.
B009M7YWJW|5.0|We had been searching everywhere for this movie and were really excited when we found it here!  Good quality picture.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you like Mahjong, you will like this.  It has so many different patterns you do not get bored with them.  I forget how long I am playing at times, and have to quit even though I do not want to.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|I just wanted to watch more.. This show left my mouth hanging wide open... I was always in shock...<br />Its a realistic view and not a fairy tale thats for sure!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|fair enough program for fun play but would not consider it for serious games or tutoring, fairly strong but not for your average club player
0762445262|4.0|I gave this to my best friend for his birthday. I felt cheap giving him the wrapped present because it's so very small. But once he opened it, he loved it. The light works effectively in a normal room (office, living room, bedroom, etc.) The book that comes with it might be good for a kid, as it's also quite small. Great novelty gift for a Batman lover!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|is this the entertainment of the future along with UFC -MMA and other blood sports as this seems to be the way the human race is heading towards for its entertainment
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book was very cleverly written.  The vintage pictures included in the book are real pictures from the past.  The author was able weave a very interesting story around these unusual photographs that was entertaining to read.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|good action flick - shots of shooting and killing. good guys sort of win in the end. plenty of action!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent story. Could not put it down. Well written and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes this kind of genre.
B00A3AU9KI|4.0|This works fine.  It charges the phone quickly.<br /><br />I like the straight cable better than the coiled cable on my previous car charger.
B008L1F91A|5.0|This is an amazing display piece! The sculpt is amazing and really does justice, pun intended, to the new 52 design of Supes. I was pleasantly surprised that the figure has a magnetic feet and attaches securely to the base. There is no articulation on this, as it is a statue and NOT a figure. The base displays \\"Justice League\\" in a raised embossed logo. I bought this along with Green Lantern and Flash. They all share the same magnet setup and look amazing together!<br /><br />Coro
B008XG1X18|5.0|Of course I love Pinterest, and the app works well. I've only had one glitch and it was somehow related to a particular board. But the normal functionality is perfect!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|First hand account of the most deadly sniper in history. A true American Hero. Chris you were taken from us too soon. You are in a much better place now. RIP Brother

B00008D1NF|5.0|This CD is so refreashing I only wish they would have recorded more. Please buy this CD you will LOVE it...
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I didn't even know of this series existence until sometime in 2012, when I started watching re-runs on TNT.  So I am having to collect episodes through Amazon, Hulu and demand on Time Warner.  I think I have now seen every episode.  And this makes me very sad.  ABC needs to make more episodes as quickly as possible to keep up with the demands of my present addiction. Right now I'm starting to go through &#34;Castle Withdrawal&#34;.  Hurry up ABC.  And don't even think about ever cancelling the show.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app. You. Can set it to a nice dim light so it's not disturbing. Lots of useful settings for different purposes. Would love to have had this when I was working and going to school.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|Another good Mankell mystery, but I hated to finish it!!!!! I feared the worst as certain events occurred, but was still rather surprised when the end came.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|this downloaded and functioned as it should on my first gen kindle (they do have 2 finger touch by the way for the reviewer who said they do not.<br />I found this game to be frustrating - I just don't have the patience to sit there and watch a ball float around - I see why some may call it relaxing but it made me want to tap the screen to make it move faster which of course is counter productive in this game. I rated the game where I did because my impatience isn't the fault of the developer - overall this game is made well just not &quot;my cup of tea &quot;.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this. I've been an SF fan for more than 50 years and once this story grabbed me, about halfway through the first part, i couldn't stop reading.  plus I love the publishing model and the promise of bringing fresh new talent forward AND rewarding them for their efforts.<br /><br />All I want now is more!  So back to the order page..
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I am not usually into bio type science-fiction shows but this has totally changed my mind.  It was awesome and totally kept me interested.  I have recommended it to EVERYONE
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love this series!  Wonderful, heartwarming stories of the goings on in the prosperous town of Candelford and the nearby farm hamlet of Lark Rise.  The scenery, costumes and sets are fabulous and show great attention to detail, but it is the characters that draw you in.  They quickly become like dear friends you have known for a long time and love dearly despite their foibles.  It reminds me of the Anne of Green Gables series - once you enter the world you just don't want to leave.  I'm totally adicted and have to ration myself to only two episodes at a time.
0765325950|5.0|Brandon is doing a very good job of tying up all the loose ends. Half way through on the first day/night. Have slowed down since to enjoy the story. It is one that I regret having to put down.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|I don't like this because whenever u plug in your charger the app pops up<br />that is the only thing I have a problem with
B0084B5TK8|5.0|To all purveyors of gore and brain splattering and eyes popping out_--------- this is how to write a scary horror novel
B00004U45G|5.0|I didnt know this CD existed until I heard tracks on Pandora. A must have for Zep fans and Crow fans.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I was hooked immediately and wanted to read it through without putting it down...then when I reached the end I was so disappointed.  It seemed like all the major plot lines just fizzled out.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|ok, I have played the game on the Pc and really enjoy it, its a great game.  But its kind of hard to play if it doesn't download onto the kindle... Three bucks down the drain, and the people who get the money are the ones who didn't do the right things to allow me to download this game.  Sounds unfair to me.  Help or refund please?
0770435726|4.0|For a first novel, this is full of promise.  Granted, as other reviewers have noted, there are plenty of flaws, but the pacing and plot twists keep you going.  Stylishly written with plenty of wry observations and black humor.  Looking forward to more from Chris Pavone.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What can I say about this show that hasn't already been said? Love the second season as much as the first. Thanks again to Amazon for making it available!
B000I2JI80|5.0|Love this film! Pro400 is my absolute favorite! Great colors! Lovely skin tones... Prompt delivery. I would recommend this product to everyone!!!
B001OG3VOQ|4.0|One of my favorite albums all time. Very raw and passionate. Also a very transparent album that is very relatable.
B009HSVHV2|5.0|What can I say?  I started out as a fan in the 70's...now I'm a disciple. :)  There is no middle ground with KISS.  I think this is one of their best.
B00BHU261S|5.0|Great acting by  both of the main actors; the story is interesting, bringing out facts about  Hitchcock that most people would not know.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|I felt so ill that I couldn't finish the movie in one sitting - it was mind numbing and blew me away about the level of dedication and craftmanship that Jiro and his two sons displayed. This old idea of mentorship and apprenticeship has long left us where expertise and mastery take a lifetime. Now, we have &#34;experts&#34; rise everyday within their field without ever having to climb any mountain to get there.<br /><br />One of my favorite movies of all time.
0937381888|4.0|I can't say enough.  I found this book easy to read, intuitive and exactly what I needed to learn to brew my own beer.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great game for free, what more could you ask for then Angry birds for free! Very habit forming for any age!
1452110581|5.0|This is a good gift idea for anyone you know who loves cats! The poems are very funny and relatable as a cat owner!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|If you liked the XFiles you will love this one! It is a really cool story line. It is awesome!
B0026PA05M|5.0|I heard a bit from this band of Sirius XM, so I thought to download the album. I am very impressed; ended up buying one more album and was equally impressed.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Argo is a great combination of compelling story, great performances, and expert direction by Ben Affleck.  Please see this movie!
B005HSL626|4.0|my grandchild had a great time playing with this one, I think that it give them great skill  I will keep this on my kindle
B001UTW7QU|5.0|what started as a test to see how amazon instant video worked quickly hooked me up...initially I thought this was super boring sci-fi stuff, but as it turns out it's interesting and enjoyable to see, so I plan on keep on watching. Nice!
B0095P31L6|5.0|Suitable for any aged audience, &#34;Rango&#34; has something for everyone. . Although you may have grown up with animation and the &#34;Western&#34;, the sum total here shows just what is possible today. A comfortable plot with great characters was anticipated, this was so much more than expected. I hope that it is recognized as the classic breakthrough it is! . .
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is fun u always get points or rewards n having the numbers called out is great live it
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Seasoned Kindle user, but the &#34;apps&#34; are new territory for me. &#34;Battery HD&#34; works like a charm, gives good information and is super easy to use, It has become a valued tool for my &#34;Fire HD&#34;.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|A thriller to the end.  This film was recommended to us by a friend who also worked for the CIA, in the same area of the world, during the time that these events took place.  He wanted us to see exactly what the CIA was about.  He said, &#34;This is what we do.&#34;
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a very in depth book on the life and the person.  You almost have to read it if you own any Apple product.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This book make so much sense. Thank you Dr.Chapman. I just finished it and am excited to apply the technique to my relationship. It is not in trouble,but to have this information before it gets there is a win-win for us both!  Again thank you Dr.Chapman. Sincerely Michele Hamblin
B0074QGGK6|3.0|It's a fast read, well extremely fast.  It's true also, but I don't think it is limited to artists.  Anything involving money and you will see copy cats or thiefs who call it &#34;inspiration&#34;
B003Z49LYO|1.0|Horrible story!  I know it's based on the novel, but having never read the novel, I didn't know what to expect.  I kept thinking things would turn around and get better for Tess, but it just got worse and worse.  Stupid novel, stupid movie, utterly depressing.
0743201140|5.0|My company uses these books with almost all employees, and they have been very effective in developing staff and leaders within the firm.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I never expected to really enjoy the first book but I did.  I was sure catching fire would be good but it too exceeded my expectations.
B00321MGPG|5.0|One of the greatest and most informative shows of our time. Just incredible. I'd watch it a dozen more times.
B003AYMZO2|4.0|I have not watched movies online other then this one so I have nothing to compare it too.  I was happy with the quality.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great story, My first introduction to barefoot/minimalist running. I really enjoyed how there was a story then the facts were interwoven in the text.
B001HMSFFC|5.0|If you love the girls, you will most likely love this movie. It's a lot of fun.  The fashion is over the top, of course, but it's fun to look at.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Despite never having heard anything about this movie, or even really seeing any trailers, I ordered this movie to watch because it was amongst the list of Oscar nominations.  I value the acting of those actors with the leading roles, so I felt &#34;safe&#34; that this would be a good pick.  While the acting was commendable (especially Joaquin Phoenix ... he was hardly recognizable), the movie itself was horrible ... the story made no sense!  I kept waiting for it to all fall into place ... for that &#34;aha!&#34; moment, but it never came.  Gripes: (1) there is no foundation for the basis for how &#34;troubled&#34; the lead character is in the first place; (2) there is no explanation as to the beginning of a supposed former romantic relationship of the main character; (3) there is no rhyme or reason to the various elements of the &#34;Master's&#34; teachings ... it was not even believable that someone would fall into following him; (4) the language and nudity, in my opinion, are beyond an &#34;R&#34; rating ... should be an &#34;R+&#34; or something higher ... I found it to be very disgusting; (5) I often recommend, if not a great movie, for people to wait til it comes out on DVD and rent it at home ... I wouldn't even recommend that.  It was a total waste of 2 hours in my opinion, and I'm sorry I spent the money and time on it.
B003ZJ70W4|1.0|I've seen this movie before and thought it was pretty good, not as good as the first movie. However, I could not get this movie to download. When I tried the &#34;watch now&#34; feature, it wouldn't play past 53 minutes in. Waste of money. I tried several times. It has not happened to other movies I've ordered from Amazon, so I guess there was some kind of glitch with this one.
0060575913|3.0|The Good: Coraline is rather imaginative. It sort of showcases the dangers of boredom and idle curiosity. If written for an older audience, it quite possibly could have worked better for me as the story did have its merits.<br /><br />The Bad: Weird. Not good weird, either. Creepy, but not exactly in way it's meant to be. I really like Gaiman's writing style, but Coraline wasn't working for me. And I can't imagine young readers really loving this either. It would give my 12 year old nightmares.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Love the Seagate Drive and interchangeable interfaces works perfectly with the Mac and Firewire and the USB3 works great on WIn 7
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Will buy all the episodes and enjoy every minute watching them!<br />I recommend this movie to everyone! You just can't stop watching it!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love a good saga! Interesting to imagine how the story could possibly continue! I would recommend it to anyone!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I would recomend this movie to everyone! Just can't stop watching the epsisodes..very intertaining! I want all the episodes and intend on getting them!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Fun stuff. Hope the series doesn't start to drag on like the books do--the later books are notorious for not going anywhere fast.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Bought this movie to relive my childhood and I am so glad that I did. I bought it used because most of the Disney Classics go for $50-$75 and I just don't want to have to pay that. The case was broken when I received it but the seller warned me that there was a possibility for that. The movie played well and I am happy with the overall purchase. Definitely a movie to have around for my children to grow up on as well.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is by far the best version of Jane Eyre. You will fall in love! :) A must buy...because you will watch it a million times guaranteed!
0439023513|5.0|Obviously, by all the hype of these books - people know they are good reads! I was so happy with this series, I had to re-read them twice especially since the movies are coming out! If you haven't already bought this book and read it - please DO, you will not be disappointed!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We are becoming very avid fans of this series and have the highest regard for the production, casting and story-line.  The<br />Crowley family and staff are becoming household names in our house! We will be ordering Season 3, too.
B0013ND30W|5.0|This is by far my favorite Disney movie from my childhood. I bought it through Amazon because retail value of these movies are very expensive. I am thankful I found one for a reasonable price because it is worth having around for my children to grow up on just like I did. For buying used, I was very pleased with what I received.
B0014DQSG2|3.0|Good movie with girlfriends  if you've seen all the other girlie ones. Predictable 'American versus stiff upper-class British' jokes, with an occacionally surprising one.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Anytime an author includes children in a story who are at the mercy of authority figures, it makes for a touching piece.  The characters were well written and really came to life.  Although the story was somewhat heart-wrenching in places, there was also a bit of humor.  The story of two uncomplicated people who find one another through a series of unlikely events, but a surprising twist in the end.  Most enjoyable !
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Too much religion. Good acting, fun soundtrack. Script needed some work. Action scene for the crash was solidly done. OK.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I have found this app quite usefully it is just it doesn't tell you how long you have got playing on a game which is annoying because I use my kindle fire hd mainly for games but overall it is good and it is free.
B0074ALZ7Q|4.0|The young and shy narrator, formerly humbly employed as a lady's companion, seems to have a dream future ahead of her when, after a whirlwind romance lasting only weeks, she becomes the new Mrs De Winter and the new lady of the imposing Manderley Hall.<br /><br />She is haunted by the memory of Maxim's first wife Rebecca and this, in itself, is both subtly and spookily rendered by Du Maurier but I think it was the overbearing and somewhat tortuous psychological bullying from Manderley's housekeeper, Mrs Danvers, who struck a chord of fear in me.<br /><br />Consumed with jealousy, Mrs Danvers is 'missile launched' to reek maximum unhappiness on the new Mrs de Winter by constantly trying to brainwash the latter into a recognition that the young Mrs de Winter is an 'intruder', not only in Manderley but most significantly in her widowed husband's life, where only the memory of Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, belongs. Indeed, spiritually, if not in apparitional presence, Rebecca is still the lady of the house and still the real love of Maxim's life.<br /><br />Perhaps the sixty-four thousand dollar question is whether, under the combined pressures of the psychological manipulation from Danvers and the 'presence' of Rebecca, the increasingly remote Maxim will totally lose his love of his troubled new wife, or whether later revelation of Manderley's secret will save their marriage.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great game! It is really fun. Definitely a five star review!! You can choose characters, cars, upgrades, and power ups. This takes place on the beach. You should really get it!!!! :) :)
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I do love it!  Its portrayal of community life; caring  for each other, dealing with all the situations that life brings us no matter what century we live in.  It teaches, deals with your heart, contains all kinds of characters who are dealt with in such loving, helpful ways.  Builds moral character instead of contributing to degradtion!
B005IQZB14|5.0|My curiosity about a woman hiking the Pacific Coast Trail alone is what is what sparked my attention. The fact that she left the trail several times to be driven to different parts of the trail seemed to be \\"cheating \\". None-the-less, I was always anxious to read what came next. I couldn't put the book down.

1439181780|5.0|Some people just can't grasp the depth of these teachings. Some people just aren't \\"there\\", where this takes us. I was \\"there\\", ready to receive the news when it was brought to my attention. I LOVE it all! How can you go wrong when just a few of the things Byrne talks about have to do with, love, gratitude, smiling at everyone, saying thank you, etc. All positive things to apply to one's life. This stuff has turned my life around! I have suffered from depression and P.T.S.D. for twelve long years, thinking I would always be that way. Now that I'm applying Rhonda's teachings to my daily routines, I am finally HAPPY, positive, and optimistic about what's in store for me for my life!  My friend, that turned me on to Rhonda Byrne, has been applying her techniques to his life for some time now. I have seen him go from having a chaotic, sad, unprofitable, life, to having every wish of his come true. And it's so enjoyable to be around him now. And the ways are simple simple. I have never written about anything as a review. But this stuff gives you ways to be happy almost all the time. I haven't felt this good in over twelve years. I recommend the whole series to anybody who is ready to believe they can do anything with the proper guidance. This is not hard work. It's EXCITING stuff! I am SOOOOO happy now and ready to share my love with the world!
B003B96AOW|4.0|This Deadpool is the 9th DST on the shelf and there are very very few things wrong with it.  First off, his head only really goes left and right with minimal up and down motions.  Second, the left leg seems to have a significantly better range of motion than the right leg.  Don't know why.  Finally, he's a bit difficult to pose. If he's not kneeling, then he better have some awesome posture b/c his feet don't stay put in the display base.<br /><br />Fortunately, this figure came loaded with accessories. The index fingers fit well into the pistol/rifle trigger guards and into the leg holsters.  I'd highly recommend this figure.
B005FDW7AI|5.0|This is such a wonderful family movie for anyone to see.  I would suggest this movie for the entire family.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Very graphic but has a good story line. Sometimes it can be a little too predictable.  Great characters, Kevin Bacon is the reason why I started to watch the series. Overall, I enjoy the series.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|My doctor suggested that I read this book.  I thought I understood the Atkins diet, but this book answered &#34;why&#34; the diet is effective.<br /><br />I lost 15 pounds, and brought my cholesterol under control.  I had blood and hepatic tests run monthly for 6 months.  Did not increase (or  start exercising).  All results were from the change in diet.  I am able to maintain my weight loss without much effort.<br /><br />Can't imagine what I'd lose if I walked around the block!
B00821OX98|5.0|Lots of twists and action going on. Like the inclusion of kids and what their parents are willing to do for them. They show their inventivive skills to handle almost any situation.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|While I am not a dedicated Josh fan, I do enjoy many of his earlier releases.  This CD just seemed to have been made to make a few bucks.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just finish reading Fifty Shades of Grey for the third time. It's a good book to read. I love characters Anastasia Steele and Kate. I like Christian Grey but any normal person would've done the same thing as Ana did at the end. Christian has a multi personality disorder. And not everyone can deal with that fifty shades of f###up. If anyone loves this book I would say read Nervous by Zane.
B006RJTEIC|3.0|I enjoyed revisiting this sci-fi flick from my youth.  The HD quality is appealing and Jenny Agutter (the main reason I watched it) looks fabulous.  Michael York is earnest and Peter Ustinov chews the scenery as is his wont.  What's not to like?
B00000DC7J|5.0|I WAS INTRODUCED TO PIAZZOLLA BY MY BROTHER AND I'M REALLY DIGGING HIS MUSIC. I LIKE ZERO HOUR AND PLAN TO GET A FEW MORE OF HIS ALBUMS
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Good entertaining movie. I liked the new team, action and special effects especially the scene at the skyscraper.  It's worth watching
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game blows your mind!<br />I loved to pet and care for the horse; it's so realistic! Wow it's so cool.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I had never seen Grey's Anatomy, but I got a Kindle HD for Christmas and joined Prime immediately.  I also retired in November of 2012 so I decided to give my Kindle and Grey's Anatomy a try.  I am now an addict and am watching from beginning to end.  I am now on season four watching two to three episodes a day.  Sooooo much fun not waiting a week to see what is going to happen when the show ends on a cliff hanger.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I always liked Maroon 5 but was never a real fan until this album. Good stuff! I wish I would have bought this album sooner.
0553382179|4.0|Marla Cilley, the FlyLady, [...], has nurtured a millions-strong online community of people who share organizing tips and tools, motivation, and comradeship.  They support and empower each other in countless ways.  Ms. Cilley is the bedrock of that community, who over the course of her own struggle with chronic disorganization developed a very simple, very gradual, very gentle step-by-step program for the problems of keeping an organized life which can and should be used by many many many people.  Her ideas are summarized by the book's title - just clean your sink.  Make it shine.  It's a \\"BabyStep,\\" the start of it all.  And wear your shoes. And pick out your clothes for the next day.  And then, next day when you are ready, clean your sink, wear your shoes and pick out your clothes for the next day.  And then one day, clean your sink, wear your shoes, pick out your clothes for the next day and...  another chore.  And it builds from there: Ms. Cilley and her organizing companions offer tips on what to focus on when, why and how.<br /><br />Sink Reflections is the summary of Ms. Cilley's on-line teachings.  It, by itself, provides a wonderful foundation for people to work themselves out of disorganization.  It is also a great introduction to her on-line community, which can help you decide whether to join the on-line network.<br /><br />But I have a confession about this book.  I find it VERY annoying.  Ms. Cilley is a WONDERFUL woman, kind, generous, gentle, and good-humored. She is FIERCELY dedicated to motivating her community.  She is also devotedly, admirably religious, and her spiritual and faithful orientation is a strong part of her writing and teaching.  I am non-observant and agnostic, and so, sadly, I find this book difficult to enjoy as completely as I wished.  I add this opinion only because it may be true for other people as well.<br /><br />Lauren Williams, Casual Uncluttering LLC, Woodinville, WA USA
B006LSZECO|4.0|Be prepared for lots of twists and turns in this can't put down book. It will make you think long after you put it down! Great read!!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|recommended to my daughter and friends.  Would recommend to young adults and older. Women would enjoy the read more than men.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy and a good time killer, just as easy to use as my online version.  My husband plays this all the time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I absolutely love this show and anticipate the next episode with either a tissue box or a hand clap every time I watch it! THANK YOU!
B008YRVW0I|4.0|Good game  the premium at bottom of the page.  Cool game for kids and adults  I love this game thanks.
B005LUJWBM|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in this one by Baldacci. It lacked some depth, I felt. Seemed a little tired.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|very easy even for us older folks. wish it was a longer game but it was free,  so no complaints.
B007EE564U|5.0|Another fast-moving Mitch Rapp adventure, ends far too soon. Exciting pace, great characters...he (Vince Flynn ) hasn't disappointed yet. Long may he continue in this vein!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Awesome, comfy, lets you hear everything in the game! Worth it! It also lets you change the dynamics of the sounds through different channels
B007N85POS|5.0|love this game in hd! So much fun and so addicting! Definitely a must have if you like angry birds!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP.. I WISH HOWEVER YOU CIYKD GAIN GEMS AND EBGERY QUICKER AND connect to friends easier that are not in your th.. but other then that a very addicting and fun game!
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Actually painful to watch.  Acting was ok, but the storyline was pathetic.  Avoid at all costs.  Maybe the book was good??
B00BHMETKC|2.0|Full of cliches and generally did not keep my attention.  Found it to be yet another over-hyped Hollywood film.  On the positive side it did give me a glimpse back in time as to what happened with the USA and its support for the Shaw of Iran.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Product was just as promised.  This was a good transaction.  I would not hesitate to order something else from this seller.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Enough others have commented at length about this that I don't need to add much more. It's simply the best stage recording I've seen of anything. I like Phantom, it's not my favorite, but they got this superbly perfect. I saw it on PBS first and knew I'd have to buy it and the blu ray to watch it. I was not disappointed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show just gets better and better!! I can sit and watch this show for hours, it's such a unique view into that era but has so much going on that keeps you engaged and entertained.
B007SGM084|3.0|I brought this book because of all the hoopla surrounding it.  It took me longer than it should have to read it but overall it was OK.
B0018RA6DK|5.0|The movie is still funny.  The bar scene is a classic bit. Amazon streaming was below standards, with buffering and freeze during the streaming.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The visuals on this program are awesome. While I like the program my seven year old nephew has to watch it every time he comes to visit.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|It does not matter whch book I pick up by Zafon I just have to read i in one session even if it means staying up all night. He was recommended as a reader by a student from Spain who was taking my English Literature class and I am so glad. His adult and children's books are a must for all.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I enjoy letting my grandson watch this movie. He recently got a video game of the same title and did not know Wall-e so i got this movie for him and now he loves Wall-e even more.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Linkedin has possiblities for me to interact with others who are interested with assisting others to obtain a healthier lifestyle and a more well rounded education.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is great for kids but for anyone 30+ it is equally fun. It includes humor and references to the 70s-80s and video arcade games from that era. So creative and funny!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 12 year old son and 7 year old daughter LOVE this game!!!  They have it on their Kindle Fire's and play it constantly!!  My son even has it on his smart phone!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have not learned exactly how to use Pinterest yet. I think I have put something on my boards but can not find it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Who cannot accept this film? This was such a brilliant movie and had exceptional graphics and CGI. I cannot wait for the next line up.
8862933177|5.0|This Journal is a great way to keep track of your favourite flicks and makes easier to share this info with friends and loved ones.
B0055EDCGU|5.0|Great album. Trivium always produces great music lyrically and otherwise. I will continue my metal collection and be sure to add more of their albums
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is epic. Ive loved mc since I tried the demo. The only problem is redstone. I mean 1.5 just came out 2 times the redstone. ADD REDSTONE PLEASE
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I heard about this show and kind of just ignored until people at work started telling I could be a good fit for it. I went ahead and started all the episodes on Netflix and became hooked. I look forward to the new seasons coming up and really enjoy the show.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I am glad I finally got to see this. It is good. I understand what the hype is all about now
B0087GJ8KM|2.0|just not very meaty - not a lot to take away and deploy.  other sales books provide far more insight and actionable information
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|please. fix the credits on Multi player and I here the update for the apple version. where 's the kindle one???!?!????
0345536886|2.0|I like more mystery and drama and this had neither.  Too much about the law and not enough about the characters.  Not his best by far.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was an amazing book. Probably the best scifi book I've read in a long time. My palms were actually sweating towards the end of the book. I really would like to see more from Weir in the future.
1455508977|3.0|I wanted the story to take me along but it was bland...I need more depth.  It was an easy read and would recommend to young people.
B007N85POS|5.0|I can't keep myself away from this game. I Love It!!! Keeps my stress level down, and gets me focused
B001NHNG64|5.0|I really like Lee Child, and a reading the Reacher series. First experience with the kindle reader app on my iPad and iPhone. Very similar to the iBook reader native on the devices. Comfortable to read on both iPad and iPhone. Nice to have the book with me all the time.
B00BKTFABE|4.0|Easy to use, works great! I do think this application should let you do more with it, even though it is great like it is.
B00A8OWOSO|5.0|Simply a great movie.  I was shocked when I realized I had never seen it before!  It has twists, turns and keeps you interested!
B004YRSC7I|5.0|One of the best movies I saw on Netflix streaming. I liked it so much I bought it here after canceling Netflix.<br /><br />The movie doesn't follow a normal chronological flow from start to finish. It shows scenes and eventually you arrive at the whole picture. The movie is pretty good but you will probably be confused and unimpressed if you do not pay attention to details throughout the film. If you like movies such as The Prestige, The Illusionist, or Inception you will probably enjoy this film as well.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Great little calculator app. Nice big buttons and easy to read display with all the functionality I need. I recommend it.
B008VBYN80|4.0|kingdom and lords is a great game to people that love strategy games because u can build your own kingdom and fight battles but I dislike the whole diamond for real money since its such an addictive game your tempted to buy them but still a 3-4 star game
