B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a leadership study disguised as history.  Unlike many leaders, Abe hired the best people instead of the easiest to manage.  There were no \\"yes men\\" in his cabinet and no Lincoln loyalists.  This is a recipe for disaster, according to today's business books.  But the accomplishments of Lincoln's team were stellar.      No way around it -- this is a long book, but the anecdotes make it fun reading and the characters are fascinating.  One subject barely noted in the book is the tragic lives of many of the characters in the years after Lincoln's presidency.  Follow-up reading perhaps?
0385333846|5.0|I love this book!<br /><br />Slaughterhouse Five is brilliantly written. Vonnegut is a master, distorting the format and genre of the novel into something baroque and complex while charismatically keeping the experience light and readable. Although you can tell the author is a bit curmudgeonly, it is his outstanding sense of humanity that raises this book from casual entertainment to a profound and important focal point for the introspection of our entire species.<br /><br />This quote in particular filled me with hope:<br /><br />\\"I have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part in massacres, and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them with satisfaction or glee. I have also told them not to work for companies which make massacre machinery, and to express contempt for people who think we need machinery like that.\\"

1591396190|5.0|This book opens up new possibilities when you thought every route was exhausted. It redefines the way we approach business strategy in such a simple yet effective way that one can not help but give its ideas a try. Read the first 40  pages or maybe less and you will have already gained something valuable. Terrific!
B00127RAJY|4.0|So I got this video a few months ago and I started level one and moved on to level two. I stopped because my summer hours increased but recently got back into it. I love this dvd. After a few weeks of doing week 1 and 2 I'm kind of bored with the work out (Im still sweeting like a pig and getting a good workout I just needed something exciting to keep me interested) so I bought her Ripped in 30 to switch things up a bit. Man am I feeling the work out now with both DVDs.<br /><br />She is a great trainer. Really pushes you to do a good job.
B004K4GDE4|5.0|great album!!!!!!!! don't doubt about it. the vinyl version on double lp 180 gram is great too. buy it!!! the sound is great, better than the cd.
1897299214|4.0|Guy Delisle spent a few months in North Korea working on an animation project and shares his experiences through this nicely drawn, graphic narrative.  While the book is scattered with various insight into the day-to-day experiences one would encounter in NK a good portion is also spent covering relationships and mishaps with his various handlers (Translator, Guide, Driver) who accompany him nearly 24/7 throughout his stay.  All in all, while the perspective is limited (due to the limitations imposed on Delisle by his handlers) it is an interesting POV nonetheless.
0316067938|5.0|I dont know what the problem with some people. Go read something else, stop bashing on twilight. I loved breaking dawn it's my favorite book. The story from the beginning was great!
B005COO1X6|4.0|I would give this 4.5 stars. I enjoyed this book up until the end.  I don't want to include spoilers, so I will just say that the end was not as strong as other King books.  Overall though, I enjoyed the story and the writing.  These short stories are the only King I will be reading with what the publisher is charging for full length Kindle books.      King did a great job with the characters in this book, seems to be a weak spot for a lot of authors.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The following films are missing from this \\"Complete Saga:\\"    Star Wars (1977)  The Empire Strikes Back (1980)  Return of the Jedi (1983)    Star Wars: Special Edition (1997)  The Empire Strikes Back: Special Edition (1997)  Return of the Jedi: Special Edition (1997)    Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope (2004)  Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (2004)  Star Wars: Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (2004)    As a fan of the original films, their absence is most strongly felt. They are historic elements of American and world pop culture, and I would very much like to see them in a state-of-the-art presentation. I would also like to see the 1997 Special Editions from time to time, just for nostalgia's sake. They are not as good and not nearly as important as the original films, but I saw them in the theaters and I would like to relive that experience. They are also interesting artifacts of 1990s CGI; who had ever seen 20-year-old live footage integrated with modern CGI before the Han-Jabba conversation? Although I haven't seen the 2004 versions, I am sure they have their fans. Many people must consider it \\"their\\" Star Wars Trilogy. Every one of these films, from 1977-2004, is important to someone, and should be included in any complete set.    You will not see these films in the Complete Saga. You will, instead, see new works assembled from pieces of the old and brand new elements. These new works include new directorial choices, sometimes made without the input of the actual directors; new actors; revised characterizations; new music and sound effects; and changes to the narrative. Most importantly, in my opinion, is a certain change made to Return of the Jedi. The pivotal argument in Jedi is a debate between Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi about the nature of Darth Vader (and, by extension, any person who does evil, all of us). In the 1980 and 1997 films, it is resolved one way; in the 2004 and 2011 films, it is resolved another. The original resolution, Ithink, is more mature and poignant. Other changes flatten character arcs, undercut dramatic beats, and introduce inappropriate slapstick humor. These derivative works published under the Star Wars name are not as good as the source material, which remains, sadly, unavailable in HD (or even DVD) quality.    (Admittedly, most of these changes predate the 2011 versions, but as the BD has carried them over, so I carry over my criticism.)    You also won't get the theatrical editions of the prequels in this set, or even the first home video version of The Phantom Menace. They weren't very good movies, and the changes are fairly minor, but I am sure there is a prequel fan somewhere waiting for a really complete version of the prequels. This isn't it.
0307887960|4.0|Bought, read, and am now in the 2nd stage of the diet. Can't fully comment on the outcome as of yet. I am sticking it out to see how much weight I lose. It's very restrictive and may be hard to follow for a lot of people especially if you do not like meat very much.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|I bought the paid version of Soundhound for $1.99.  Although Soundhound is a very nice app, there were a few instances where it wouldn't recognize a song so I decided to try the free version of Shazam to determine if it would be a worthwhile alternative.  Unfortunately, I found that Shazam was unable to pick up the same songs that Soundhound didn't recognize.  The free Shazam has unlimited tagging until the end of 2011 so I will keep it for now.  Once that offer expires, it will be uninstalled. If Shazam would offer their paid version for $1.99, I would jump on it but the app is certainly not worth $4.99 when it does not do a better job than Soundhound.  Update (10/1/11):  The free Shazam on the Android Marketplace now has unlimited tagging without any indication of this offer expiring at the end of the year.  Not sure whether or not this also applies to this Amazon version, maybe it just needs to be updated.  Be aware that if you delete this version and download the Market version, you will lose your tags.  From my experience this app is comparable to Soundhound, both are good but neither are perfect.  Now that unlimited tagging appears to be here to stay, I have upped my rating to four stars since Soundhound does appear to be a bit faster at identifying songs.  With unlimited tagging on the free versions of both apps, my recommendation is to have both of them and if one doesn't recognize a song, then try the other.  Still waiting for the price of the paid version of Shazam to drop...
B002ZG993Q|1.0|It depends how many of these kind of films you have seen before, but I found it terrible.  The film seems more about Italian landscape and drinking coffee than anything else.  The acting at one point was terrible. Here is an example.    George Clooney is minding his own business having a coffee (what else ?) in a coffee bar.  His prostitute friend and her friend both drop in on the off chance.  She asks him if they want to meet that night. Here is the dialogue:    Pros: Where shall we meet ?  long silence  George. The usual place  long silence  Protitute: where is that ?  even longer stoney silence  george looks at her friend. Her friend smiles in embarassment.  george: Lets meet somewhere new  prostitute: ok  the prostitute and friend leave the coffee bar    end of scene.    I had to cringe. The film is just full of these kind of disjointed scenes.   The best way to describe it is like the Bourne supremacy but without the action and suspense.    Sorry two thumbs down.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect from this app when I first downloaded it. However, I have found very handy for checking my own wi-fi points for signal strength and for interference from neighboring signals.
B000JQU1VS|2.0|I enjoy reading the Sherlock Holmes stories, and bought this to have permanantly in my Kindle. The problem is that on practically every page there are typo's. It just becomes annoying after a while to read and try to interpret what is written because of the constant typo's. Very poor editing by whomever did this.
0307389839|5.0|If you have many years running or if you want to star running, this is the right book to read.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I will be brief as hundreds of reviews pouring in have already stated the absolute abomination these Blu-rays are to anybody who grew up loving Star Wars.  If you like Star Wars, you cannot accept the changes George Lucas has made and will continue to make in the future.  There needs to be a call to purity in these films, the original theatrical releases have to be preserved, and these alterations cannot be forgiven.  Anybody giving this 4 or 5 stars does not really care about Star Wars, and that is final.  My only hope is that George Lucas never touches the Star Wars Expanded Universe.  I care too much about the X-Wing, New Jedi Order, and Fate of the Jedi books to ever have George try to make a movie out of them or create an animated cartoon series so he can sell more merchandise.      My biggest regret is that kids growing up now do not understand the implications of what is happening here and they may grow up believing Star Wars is what George Lucas is presenting in these Blu-rays.  I am a big Star Wars fan, probably more of the Expanded Universe that follows Return of the Jedi than anything else, but we should still have enough respect to not mess with the originals that started it all.  On a side note, I wish Christians would get more outraged over all the hundreds of new versions of the Bible that remove or change the original KJV.  The NIV for example has over 64,000 less words than the KJV with entire verses actually missing.  Just imagine if George Lucas started cutting out scenes from the original trilogy that he didn't like, I'm sure that would go over really well with the fans... let's pray he doesn't alter them any further.
B004LWZVZC|1.0|As a Civil War buff, I anxiously awaited this movie.  I was surprised that it went in and out of the local theaters so fast, now I know why.  I fully expected that Robert Redford was going to use the trial of the Booth conspirators as an allegory tale to the current Guantanamo military tribunals and I signed up for that when I started watching.   What I did not expect was that Redford would succeed in making one of the most interesting events in American history boring.    Redford gets so caught up in preaching that he forgets story telling.  He even goes so far as to omit the actual historical incident that could have been the dramatic climax to his movie:  One of the conspirators Paine stated \\"Mrs. Surratt is innocent!  She doesn't deserve to die with the rest of us.....\\"    Popular myth has him saying it on the gallows (he said it in his cell) and Redford could have used that myth to drive home his point in a dramatic climax, yet he left it out.  Why?  I suspect because for the entire film the other conspirators in the movie could have been represented by cardboard cutouts, serving only to be shown as being led in and out hooded and then sitting like mannequins.  By the end of the movie its too late to give them  dialogue, even if that dialogue was critical to the theme of the movie.    In fairness, I think the cast did the best they could, every once in a while you see glimpses of what this movie could have been. At times you can see the pain on their faces as they grope to find some life in this dry script.    However, at the end of the movie you just sit there and say \\"Is that all there is?\\"  Hard to believe but this movie is so poorly scripted and edited at the end you see several people hung and you struggle to care.   You feel that this film commits a second murder, draining the life out of what should be a pivotal story in American History.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Excellent reading. Forget the political diatribe of the detractors. You will be intrigued and touched. The actions of Marcus and his team only underscore the dedication of our military.
B00007L4OM|5.0|Jean Reno is one of France's greatest actors and this is what I would call a \\"B\\" movie of his that he did late in his career.  It is sub-titled but a funny film about father-daughter, cross cultures, etc..  that is bought to an explosive ending since Reno is an tough minded action oriented under cover cop who worked for interpol or his country's secret service.  It is not his best work by far but if you like Jean Reno (the actor) then you will enjoy this film which seems to me to be a spoof Reno did on his own action film characters. His japanese teenage daughter whom he did know existed plays a wild teenager that anyone who has a daughter knows acts crazy like this one.... Funny film but stupid,none the less.
B000I2J0W4|1.0|I read the reviews saying the hd version was a better copy and did not see anywhere that you need a special hd player.  So we can not watch the movie.
1401223176|5.0|Hush.......Leaves you wanting more. I have read alot of different Batman stories. This is one is top 3 maybe after re-reading it might become number 1. The story is very engaging and draws you in. The plot twist and the art work is excellent. I like a comic that candraw you in. Not to spoil anything leaves u up in the air. But like Batman said the answer is in the details
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I've been a fan since i can think and what Lucas has done is....I can't actually find words for it. He's pointing the finger at us and guess what, he likes it.  I'll not buy these Blu-Ray's and I can't tell how disappointed I am right now. Sorry for my bad english!    A fan from Germany!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I really loved this TV series, and like most people was upset when it was canceled. The movie tied up most of the lose ends which helped a lot, but it would have been nicer for the series to have developed it.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|The best reason to buy this is of course, the bonus disc.  I always thought that the original  album was their best because it seemed relaxed and raw, and therefor superior to most other  studio records they made.  It was at the height of their powers, and Mick Taylor balanced against  Keith on guitars, are my all time fave combination.      So I've only heard the bonus disc once, but was impressed, and even though a few things  are obviously works in progress--from that period--and those last couple of tracks--the alternate takes--are not preferrable to what they later became; I was pleasantly suprised.    So, no, I'm no longer impressed by \\"new and improved\\" mixes, fiddling, etc..  When you've  heard an album as many times as I've heard this one, even if you buy the new and improved version,  it's still the same old album, and you feel let down for blowing your cash yet again...only, there are just a few albums that are eminently   re-listenable.  This is one of those.      And now it's got \\"NEW\\" TRACKS!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I have to agree with the multitude of reviews here, and on many other sites: if you can't at least include the original theatrical releases (in an unaltered format), then there's really no reason to purchase another set of these movies. The fans have made their voices heard - and the lack of sales ($$$) may just be the most effective response.  Guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens in the future. As for now, however, there will be no more purchases of Star Wars movies by me until we get what we are asking for - and our request is definitely not unreasonable.
B000002J1S|4.0|No matter what you think of \\"Prog\\" Genesis, and THIS album; I believe this mix is the preferrable one to that released in 2009.  I had the good luck to find the 1994 release at the same time I had a copy of the 2009, borrowed from the library.  Side by side, the 1994 mix is less harsh.  The 2009 is amplified up a bit too...when I gave it a listen, I wasn't paying too much attention.  So later, judging by what I felt about it, I went; \\"I'll just take THIS back\\".  THEN I found  the 1994 edition, used, I was similarly not paying much attention, and listened while drawing.  My project was really enhanced...then I really paid attention to the discs.  Consequently, I did an A to B comparison, and discovered the aforementioned harshness.  My subconscious must have picked up on this originally and drove me away from a worthwhile piece of music.  IF I were devious,I could have swapped my discs for the library's.  So I wouldn't even steal the 2009 edition!    I listened on everything from an mp3 player to my 100 watt home stereo.    There are plenty of good reviews here, so I won't go into detail.  Suffice to say, they played  this on the radio when it came out, on a local AOR station in the '70's.  Back then, compared  to the genius of Nursery Cryme or especially Foxtrot, I thought this bloated and boring.  But now--and this is the first time I've listened since the late 1980's--I can see the good   in this music, having matured quite a bit since then.  But yes, it's somewhat slapdash  and not as imaginative as their earlier efforts.  However, taste wise, I'll force myself to listen to any lousy Gabriel era Genesis that's not as good, over that pop junk that came after he left.    If I can get ahold of the original vinyl, I'd trade this CD in for that...vinyl is still king;  especially an all analog recording.

I plan to buy a handful of these & give them out as X-mas gifts.<br /><br />Buy this book!!  You will learn a lot about yourself & become inspired in the process.

0553801473|1.0|I am glad I am reading this on my Kindle cause when I get bored I can fast forward real fast or switch to another book. I am more content with the HBO program but again after reading 5 books, I am hoping that HBO melds them all together and make a good series. I at times feel like Martin intended to see how long he could drag this story out,before people started to complain. An author can be disrespectful to his audience and I am feeling that way.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Star Wars was a classic. Empire Strikes Back was a great sequel. Return of the Jedi was a letdown. The Prequels were an embarrassment to filmmaking. And then... Lucas started CHANGING THE ORIGINALS FOR NO REASON AT ALL. This was an abomination, and this is where I, and many others drew the line. Do not buy this. Do noy line Lucas' pockets. Take a stand and show the world that revisionism of classic movies should not be tolerated!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am sick of hearing people bashing Geore Lucas. All he has done is taken a great Sci-Fi Movie and turned it into an Icon.  As for the Movies, fans may like them, or others may not. Hold onto whatever gets you through the day. If you don't like a particular change, then watch the previous version.  I will say this I love Star Wars and I love the Prequels.  Does this make me a loser? I really don't care.  I like what I like - that is my preference. I will  continue to watch my favorite movies, and if the fan boys out there, who can't get over if Han shot first or not, or Darth Vader saying Nooooo! They should get over themselves. Oh My God Vader screams Nooooo!  lets call out the troops, because GL has messed with the movies. If that is how you feel then move on, SW is not for you anymore. However if LIke me, you love to thrive on the joy that is Star Wars then enjoy and don't let all these Posers ruin anything for you.

B000W9EOEC|5.0|This album is an awesome compilation of most of Daft Punk's greatest hits performed live and (interestingly enough) mixed together into sort of \\"mash-ups\\" where two songs at a time compete for the beat and flow seamlessly into each other.

034552554X|4.0|\\"The flower you're looking for is clearly the common thistle, which symbolizes misanthropy [...] hatred or mistrust of humankind. [...] Common thistle is everywhere.\\"    Victoria Jones knows flowers. She learned their emotional messages -- the Victorian language of flowers -- at age nine while placed with Elizabeth, a foster mother with whom she finally seemed to fit ... until she didn't, horribly, and then spent the rest of her childhood in a group home. Now 18 and emancipated from the foster-care system into San Francisco, Victoria is prickly, tenacious; misanthropic. She squanders her months of subsidized housing, stealing plants to create a potted garden in her room and then, just before eviction, transplanting them to create a garden -- and a space to live, homeless -- in her favorite park. But it's the *language* of flowers that resonates in Victoria, and in that desire to communicate might she find a reality that is the opposite of misanthropy?    Through alternating first-person narratives, each filling in and foreshadowing the other, we watch the 9-year-old and adult Victorias on parallel paths of growth and regression, hope and implosion. Along the way we learn about foster care, florists, love, and the language of flowers -- there's even an appendix listing hundreds of flowers and the emotional messages they carry. The actions of such a wounded girl are once or twice a bit facile, but this is a very well-constructed novel with a lovely voice and pace and an enduring resonance. I look forward to more by Diffenbaugh.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|The story follows Dylan, an artistic web designer turned GQ artistic director by Jamie, a NY head hunter, as he moves to NY and they form a friendship...and then some.  The first few minutes gave the writers a chance to prove that you weren't wasting your time with this movie.  We are monsooned by a clever mix of classic and rather risqu&eacute; anecdotal break-up quips as both Dylan (the ever-charming Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (the saucy Mila Kunis) both find themselves single again via synchronous break-ups.  They both make the same claim: that they'll essentially be sexually aloof and just enjoy themselves.<br /><br /> For some reason the movie depicts LA folks like they're from some kind of cow town--extra cautious about crossing the street, mild-mannered, socially naïve, non-confrontational and claustrophobic in the skyscraper-rich concrete jungle.  Likewise, New Yorkers come off as more in-your-face and edgy.  I really think of LA as sort of a drier NY with a tan, but otherwise city folks are city folks.  Despite the constant flinging of pro-NY propaganda both actors are their naturally charismatic, audience-pleasing selves.<br /><br /> The first (sex) scene that lives up to the movie's title is a hilariously endearing and very chatty session which seems like a rehearsal before filming a how-to instructional video on sex.  Great moments of this movie include a sex scene montage with a lot of well-placed and relatable dialogue, Woody Harrelson thinking JT is gay, every single Shaun White cameo scene, JT rapping and busting out some old school Criss Cross, and Woody Harrelson choosing Shaun White over Barrack Obama for a GQ cover.  Yup, that's what America has been reduced to.<br /><br /> With small roles, the brilliantly cast Jenna Elfman (Dharma & Greg), Nolan Gould (TV's Modern Family), and Richard Jenkins (HBO's Six Feet Under, Burn After Reading) are the sister, nephew and father you want to bring a girl home to meet.  All actors do a perfect job of showing us that they see what Dylan and Jamie don't.  It reminds me of my own friends waving their hands at me saying \\"it's nothing serious\\" or \\"we're just friends\\" and then getting a wedding invitation a year later.  It's so cute when they don't see it yet, isn't it?<br /><br />Kunis and Timberlake's on screen chemistry is so strong that it just made me feel good whenever they were interacting with one another.  The movie gets tactfully real a bit towards the end, but it should come as no spoiler alert that you feel all warm and fuzzy at the end.  This adorable RomCom is well worth the watch.lan and Jamie don't.

Scott covers many different facits of Digital Photography and has his own, unique way of presentation.. This book is chock full of tips and information for, not only the beginner, but also for the more advanced photographer... A must have book....

I like the Crystal Palace Cake Pop Stand at [...] (click on the cake pop stand page). They're showstoppers!
B00001IVOF|5.0|I just got done seeing Mobb Deep in concert for the 1st time. I almost forgot how good this album is.  Seeing them do joints off this cd was like a slap in the face of how gritty and raw this album was and still is.  I was around 16 when i first had this album and it still sounds as good as it did back then.  Havoc's production is dark and grimey on here. P's lyrics are his normal street lines, but unlike todays rappers or whatever they call themselves its somewhat believable.  I'm actually not sure which album i like better between \\"The Infamous\\" & \\"Hell on Earth\\".  One thing i know is that these are the 2 best albums Mobb Deep ever put out so check them out or buy them again if you once had them.

The music itself sounds terrific and I suppose that's what really matters.      But it seems as if the releases themselves aren't everything they could have been and I find myself slightly disappointed.      For example, the packaging lacks any creativity whatsoever.  The cd containers are the same plastic containers that cds have been packaged in since the 1980s.  Many bands exercise imagination with reissues...they couldn't come up with something more imaginative and original?  This is Queen afterall - a band known for originality.    The amazingly small sample of bonus material is also a major letdown.  The bonus material only contains 5 tracks (roughly) most of which is unimpressive.  They include live versions which can often be found on Queen live albums (seriously - a track from Queen Killers is included as bonus material?!), and instrumental or \\"all vocal\\" tracks of songs.  You can't tell me that this band doesn't have an abundance of demos and alternative takes that would be fun to hear as well as make the new discs worthy of a 2 disc reissue.      The only reason I can think of for the miniscule bonus discs is that Queen was always a very produced and precise band.  Perhaps these tendencies don't allow them to consider rough demos and the like worth public attention.  Too bad...
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This was a great movie for my 3 year old grandson as well as the adults in the family.  He plays the movie over and over dancing and singing to the lively music of Rio.  The bright colorful scenery invites you to travel to Rio for carnival. Great animation of characters. This movie was very well done.
0810994739|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes funny stories about weird kids. It's not a serious book but it is enjoyable. The book is suppose to be humorous and immature. Diary of a Wimpy kid is about the life of a mischievous middle-school student with an imaginative idea about his future. This book in the series deals with the protagonist's big brother Rodrick and little brother Manny are tricksters in their own way. The way these characters interact reminds me of my relationship with my brothers except their a little extreme. The book is a fun read and I might read the entire series. I like how the author portrays the characters and make diary really sound like it was written from a kid's point of view. I would read more books similar to this.
159562015X|3.0|Strengths Finder 2.0 is good to determine general areas of interest, strengths and talents but don't expect mind blowing revelations. Also, I was a bit disappointed that the code could only be used one time. It seems that similar products would allow a code to be used at least twice which allows your spouse to get results as well. Why would people in the same household buy the same book just to take the assessment? However, it does provide a decent action plan with some though provoking assignments.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I got this for my friend.. it delivers good amplified output that rocks my ears before my headphones.. its pretty small and easy to lug around along with an iPod tho It looks kinda cheap.. you can feel it once you open the box and plug in your headphones.. still good for its price!
B005E2PQTE|5.0|- Mission coordinator Jess Parker on the monitors (as anomalies crop up everyfriggin'where!): \\"I don't believe it! There's another one. It - it's outside! The car park!\\"<br />- The ARC Director James Lester: \\"Oh my god! My new Jag's in the car park! This time it's personal!\\"<br /><br />***First off, this DVD is Region 2. Next, there is a Region 1 DVD already out ([[ASIN:B004QOB8TS Primeval: Volume Three]]) which contains Series 4 & this one, Series 5 (thanks, FYI!!!)***<br /><br />There was a point in Series 1 in which I thought the insidious Helen Cutter was a redeemable character. But she proved me wrong, and all the way thru to Series 3, she persisted in proving me wrong. And more than a year past her death, Helen Cutter's diabolical legacy lives on, perpetuated in the shape of Philip Burton (Alexander Siddig), philanthropist, scientist, and currently ARC's primary deep pockets. It's Philip Burton now who advances Helen's apocalyptic agenda.<br /><br />So this is PRIMEVAL - THE COMPLETE SERIES FIVE, and on two discs it collects all six episodes, and I'm not sure there'll be any more after this, even though the concluding chapter does leave us once again tantalized and craving. As this series opens, whiz kid Connor Temple (Andrew-Lee Potts) is drifting away from his ARC (Anomaly Research Centre) teammates, and especially from his girlfriend Abby (Hannah Spearritt). Connor's been lacking a bit of team spirit and had been somewhat remissed in deploying with the others as they investigate temporal anomalies and fend off creature incursions. His time toiling away at Philip Burton's top secret New Dawn project has kept him away from the field. Again, as with last season, it's frustrating that Connor still harbors a man crush on Philip, out of whose genius bum he thinks the sun radiantly shines.<br /><br />If you haven't yet seen Series 4, there's no need to read this following paragraph because in it there be Series 4 SPOILERS. But if you've seen Series 4, then you're aware that new team leader, Matt Anderson, actually hails from a dying Earth in the future and that he had Kyle Reese'd it to the present to avert an impending cataclysm. Matt had confessed as much to Abby and, furthermore, had let it slipped that Burton's New Dawn project is the doomsday device he intends to shut down. Except that there's Connor's adoration at Burton's feet to mull over. So, essentially, there's your ongoing character conflict.<br /><br />I've written about PRIMEVAL's previous seasons, and I'm in danger now of regurgitating a heap of praises so glowing they've set off the Geiger counter. Suffice it, Series 5 continues PRIMEVAL's tradition of gripping drama and high adventure - with a strong dash of sci-fi horror - and ripping special effects. Not to mention the unexpected character arcs and the inadvertent history lessons in paleontology. Even though, of late, I've been exasperated with Connor and that blind eye when it comes to Philip Burton, he and Abby are still my favorite characters. And I guess having them fall smoothly into a nice and perfect romantic relationship would be too dull of a thing. Ben Miller's take on his character, the deliciously sardonic ARC Director James Lester, is friggin' superb and so very funny. It helps that he gets the best lines. I'm even starting to warm up to Ciar&aacute;n McMenamin, whose Matt Anderson I'd once thought automaton-bland. He sparks it up some in this series. I hope to Gargamel that there is a Series 6 in the offing. But, if not, and even with the cliffhanger ending, this is a fine way to go out. Series 5's final episode is an explosive one, fraught with desperate danger and a fight for all the marbles and the return of ARC's next most fiendish foe (after Helen Cutter). And there's also James Lester's priceless one-liner about his new Jag.<br /><br />Bonus feature: \\"New Dawn - Making the new PRIMEVAL Part 2\\" - an overview of Series 5 with particular focus on the sets and the digital f/x, and with cast& crew interviews (00:15:33 minutes long).<br /><br />Remember: read the Region Code before you purchase this DVD set.<br /><br />The following is a list of brief episode breakdowns for Series 5.

B000EMGAOY|4.0|Perhaps it was because of the long withstanding association with George Clinton that gives me the outlook on Red Hot Chili Peppers as more of a funk band than a rock one. That doesn't of course mean that I dislike rock. In fact this album is very obviously going for the similarly sprawling double album statement that The Clash were going for with [[ASIN:B00004BZ0N London Calling]] or that James Brown was going for with albums such as [[ASIN:B000001E77 Hell]]. Actually,this seems to adopt aspects of both of those albums in many ways. It would seem that the band were going for something of a more polished alternative rock light on their previous couple albums to this. It was almost as if their funk oriented beginnings had been some type of fashionable embrace of the genre on their part. It wasn't as it turned out. And in many ways funk,a music that requires a level of focus to do it well would be a good way to bridge an album trying to do as much as this one does together.<br /><br />  For a double album clocking in at a little over two hours there's a lot of material on here that is a little repetitive. \\"Dani California\\",\\"Desecration Smile\\" and the title track are all interesting enough songs. But most of the other rock oriented songs here,if you take away a lot of the window dressing instrumental ideas are not all that different from each other or anything else the band has done. While in a lot of ways the same could be said of the funkier numbers it's there that a bit of the spice of variety comes into play. Both \\"Charlie\\" and \\"Warlocks\\" both meld one of their classic rhythm guitar based funk grooves with a pop/rock type song. \\"Tell Me Baby\\" and especially \\"21'st Century\\" both acknowledge the 70's a bit more with the disco-funk \\"boogie\\" hybrid sound that plays a little more cleanly and represent my personal favorites on the album. \\"Storm In A Teacup\\" sounds a lot like \\"Give It Away\\" from [[ASIN:B000002LQR Blood Sugar Sex Magik]],which makes one wonder if their rap/rock thing isn't really beginning to where thin. \\"Hey\\" and \\"Turn It Again\\" offer somewhat more jazz-fusion style instrumental approaches. But they pretty much turn into standard pop songs before they get going.<br /><br />  Ultimately they tried for something very big hear,basically by releasing a lot of material even when they had a lot more to release. There was certainly a lot of hoopla when this came out and it seemed like an almost infinite number of different packaging ideas for the album itself. That alone made it seem like it was the greatest album they ever made. In all honesty,it's hardly a masterpiece. The songs certainly all tie together well. And the songs that groove tend to give it that added kick as always. But all the same they aren't adding anything particularly new to their style either. There's the impression of a band somewhat on cruise control here. Of course yet another member transition was about to take place. So that might have had something to do with it. In the end,when it's good it's pretty near great. And it doesn't actually have as many ballads as people think it does. More or less it's mid-tempo pop/rock for the most part. So depending the type of Chili Peppers that floats your boat,and for certain they do have many musical sides to them,this will either thrill you or not. It's all a matter of taste.ugar Sex Magik]],which makes one wonder if their rap/rock thing isn't really beginning to where thin. \\"Hey\\" and \\"Turn It Again\\" offer somewhat more jazz-fusion style instrumental approaches.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Im half way though this wonderful story and my only wish is that I had actually purchased the book.

B0054N73EY|4.0|It's been an exciting five years since [[ASIN:B000EMGAOY Stadium Arcadium]],the Peppers big double album release. Honestly the side of the Chili Pepper's work I'm most familiar with would be their mid 80's material. One of the reasons I never explored a lot of their 90's work is because culturally they got very caught up in the alternative rock crowd and seemed all too often to become associated with whering diapers on stage and a lot of theatrics. Sure a lot of it was inspired as much by George Clinton as it was Iggy & The Stooges. But it seemed to take away somewhat from their musical virtues to me. That virtue,as you'd see on even their 90's music was always very strong. Even when they went more for pop than funk it seemed those values held true to their music. And their lyrics and writing are always extremely strong. Well that return to their funk oriented sound began to happen before and so it continues on with this particular album.<br /><br />  One thing to be said for sure here is that they've matured even more so than previously. Filled with standout songs \\"Monarchy Of Roses\\",\\"Factory Of Faith\\",\\"Ethiopia\\" and especially \\"Look Around\\" and the hit \\"The Adventures Of Rain Dance Maggie\\" all have that great technically inclined grooves Flea,Anthony,Chad and Josh have done so well,the other side of funk-punk I suppose. Here you also here them continuing to realize that their generation which they themselves so often celebrated were coming to the same uncertain mid life crisis as any other generational cycle of the past. On the folky ballad \\"Brendan's Death Song\\",by now rather old hat for them they're very much on the same trip only on a different groove of course. That somber,folkier and reflective tone is continued on \\"Police Station\\",\\"Even You Brutus?\\" and \\"Happiness Loves Company\\". The album concludes with two other excellent songs in  \\"Meet Me At The Corner\\",which uses it's phat melodic piano chords to illustrate the cross pollination between indie rock and hip-hop;the funk groove the song is built on gives it something of a Kayne West flavor in that regard. On \\"Dance Dance Dance\\" their in full juju afro-brazilian mode and in a more celebratory state of mind.<br /><br />  I was having a discussion with my friend from Oakland recently as to weather or not the Chili Peppers were a bonafide funk band or not. They aren't and never were. They are bonified Red Hot Chili Peppers is the best I can come to. True,as with Fishbone and other likeminded groups funk plays a part in what they do. So does punk. So does indie rock. So does a lot of things. But these guys are the type of people who have been lucky enough to be able to have a style of music making that's very much their own. A lot of people are in a class by themselves. Especially in the rock world. But only a select group of them have a style of making music that delivers uniqueness for them. They take a very 60's approach to music only in the sense that they seem to by their nature break barriars of genre while keeping heavily crafted songs intact. And perhaps that care to craft is where the funk is most important. Newest member Josh Klinghoffer does as excellent job with the rhythmic guitar thing that first Hillel Slovak,then Blackbyrd McKnight than  John Frusciante were able to achieve. Not only that but their sharp eye for being able to make many of the social concerns they illustrate in their lyrics be able to reach the people comes straight from funk as well. Yet they also reach for some of \\"message rocks\\" abstractions as well. So as usual they make what should be undoable contradictions work to their effect. And this represents the continuation of a pretty strong period for them on the musical front.e cross pollination between indie rock and hip-hop;the funk groove the song is built on gives it something of a Kayne West flavor in that regard.

B00005JKBC|5.0|I was browsing through my dvd collection looking for a Sunday movie theme and this one came out. Haven't watched in a few years. Put it in and the music first grabs you in, then the clock ticking down to BoyScout's death, Nathan's 1 day only before he retires, the weasle who wants to see Muir taken down a notch in front of everyone in order to make himself look good, along with flashbacks to fill in the gaps and it all adds up to a very tight movie. Tony Scott's movies are always good. So put this on and enjoy a Sunday classic. Its like a fine wine that gets better each time you watch it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was very excited about this set finally coming out. I was looking forward to watching it with my son in HD for first time. Will he still enjoy it , Without a doubt! But I will know the differences and won't have the originals to show him how magical movie making was at that time. Everything is CGI or changed from the way they were when I was a kid. Please Release with all versions!!
B005COO1X6|3.0|Definitely not one of his best efforts.  I was surprised when it was over, not only because the ending was a bit lame, but also because I was only 75% of the way through the book.  The last 25% was a preview of Mr. King's next book.  I didn't bother to read it because I'm sure it will be way outside the price I'm willing to pay for an e-book.  I'm disappointed because I feel I had to pay for this advertising.  Had I known Mile 81 was as short and unsatisfying as it was, I probably wouldn't have bought it.
B00006LHYC|5.0|We listened again to all of Laura's CDs last night and this one, her classic From the Inside, still stands as the top one! The songs, whether you're Italian or American, just flow and her voice is superb and the delivery... she was MADE to sing THESE songs! We're also thrilled that the CD case comes with the Italian lyrics so we can sing along.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I would say that I'm very frustrated by this, but I'm kind of used to it by now. Lucas doesn't know when to leave well enough alone and he continues to change certain aspects of his films because it's an improvement in his mind. There is nothing that could possibly be improved by adding CGI here, or making Vader talk there. I definitely won't even consider buying this and will instead pop in my hand-me-down vhs copies of the original trilogy and then hug them as I cry myself to sleep at night.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|He have wake up and smell the coffee!<br /><br />George Lucas. We know you own these movies. Why make them worst? Keep them when they first came out.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|So there he is: the revered genius mastermind behind the far away, long ago universe millions have come to devote themselves to over the course of three decades.  In his dark, empty home theater, he is watching and rewatching the original three films which effectively are his iron lung.  Instead of marveling in the ingenuity and charm which drew in hordes of fans, he racks his mind over what else he can possibly alter, because at this point, it is hard for many to imagine there could be anything else.  But not for him.  In the words of one of the gungan general in the midst of war, he challenges himself: \\"Mesa tink of something.\\"     Along with all the magic and splendor, being a Star Wars fan comes with its fair share of ridicule and mockery.  It has always been an amusing exercise in persuasion, if not defending one's artistic convictions, to declare loyalty to the franchise which defined childhoods and transcended well into adulthood.  But with each new, unnecessary and context/tone-warping alteration deemed important by its creator, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep up with the defenses.  So much so that self-defense against attacks of mockery for still standing by such a highly panned and parodied series gives way to self-ridicule, which allows no means of further defense.      Clearly, he has reached the point of no return in terms of lunacy and there is no telling what is liable to be victimized by his devolving mind next.  Well, I ain't buyin'.
B004KAB4I8|5.0|Very good introductory book on drawing dragons. Most are cartoonish in appearance but it is an excellent first step to get the basics down before attempting a more life-like creature. Might be a good way to start someone who is interested in Fantasy Science Fiction down the path of drawing/art.
B005DD7H50|5.0|This movie was a real surprise to me. A great plot with some terrific action and good acting. How come I never heard of it? The movie studios really baffle me with their promotions of awful movies like LA 2010 while never promoting a solid movie like this! Bradley Cooper just made the jump into the great actor category where DeNiro already is. Abbie Cornish's role could have been bigger. She was terrific!Highly recommended if you like intelligent action movies!
B005J0VPNC|4.0|I agree with the previous reviews....until you can choose your old pics...it only makes the app so much more fun<br /><br />EDIT - 10/12/11 - Well after a few updates - you can finally choose your pictures and apply the filters to them! Great updates - updating to 4 stars.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|2.22 is part 2 of the \\"Rebuild of Evangelion\\" and it is where there are some notable differences in the story compared to the original series. Notably adding the well-received character of Mari, and changing the pilot of unit 3.     As far as Blu-ray vs. DVD, I haven' seen 2.22 on dvd, but the Blu-ray compared to the series (watched Platinum Perfect collection) the visuals on 2.22 are far improved.     The only con to the product is that it will be a while before the last part is released in English (it hasn't had a theatrical debut in Japan as a Sept. 5 2011, and it will take time to translate and voice act.    If you're thinking about buying this, go for it and join the horde of us who are waiting for 3.33.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I would give this movie 10 stars ...quirky & unpredictable,with brilliant graphics.<br />Not run of the mill. maybe not even a kid movie.<br />Maybe a 'kid movie for grown ups'<br />Memorable entertainment.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|1.11 is the first part of the \\"Rebuild of Evangelion\\" and it stays fairly close to the telling in the original series.     The visuals show considerable improvements from the televised series and the majority of the original voice cast returns.     A solid release and it seems the creator intends for the rebuild to be the set cannon for Evangelion.     2.22 has been released and there is currently no release date scheduled for 3.33.
B000V5SIFS|5.0|Easily one of the best episodes of DS9. Certainly an episode that makes DS9 worth watching. My favourite series has always been and will continue to be TNG, but amongst all the others, DS9 is a close second. I like Voyager because of the numerous time/alternate reality based episodes that they had, but I never found any depth in the entire series, the cast never seemed to gel together and grow like the TNG cast, nor did the series have much depth (Seven of Nine being probably the only exception). DS9, though set in a space station and therefore seemingly not so much 'Star Trek' has numerous instances of real depth and frequently explores some very serious themes. If I had been introduced to the series through DS9 instead of TNG, I might very well be saying now that DS9 is my favourite! Anyway, if there is somebody out there who is wondering if DS9 is worth watching, if you are going to watch only one episode to decide if you want to invest yourself in this world, THIS IS THE EPISODE to watch!
B005COO1X6|1.0|The purpose of this book seems to be to get readers to pay $2.99 so they can gobble up the \\"free\\" preview of 11/22/63.  It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Really fun, makes you use your brain. I just wished it was longer and maybe the endingslightly more fulfilling. Over of my favorite apps I've purchased!
B002XMGGK6|1.0|I don't really need to summarize the plot do I? You can glean that from the other reviews. I'll just say that I lost a lot of respect for Gerard Butler...not because his performance here was substandard, but rather because he let himself even get involved with this train wreck of a film. Morally bankrupt (and startlingly lame) screenwriting, graceless direction by a third-rate hack, demographically-driven pyrotechnics and another one-note, wooden performance by Foxx add up to a bad viewing experience for those lucky enough to possess three-figure I.Q.s. If you loved \\"American Beauty\\" and \\"Lakeview Terrace\\", you might actually like this movie and wonder what my beef is about here. I'm sorry to report that you are beyond help. Hey, try \\"Pleasantville\\" sometime...you'll like that one too.
B002TYZKIM|4.0|If you are a Michael Jackson fan then you will enjoy this movie.  I got the CDs as gifts over the years, even though I use my ipod more today.  I wouldn't mind seeing it again, and was happy to see the movie. Loved every minute of it. Orianthi was very good  in it too, along with all the other dancers and backup players. Can't wait for the DVD to be released!
B0036S4CTS|1.0|My mother gave me this book to read and I put it on a shelf and forgot about it. I picked it up a few days ago after realizing it was the movie that Anne Hathaway was promoting on The Daily Show not too long ago. I like Ms Hathaway and thought maybe I would like this book. I understand the comparisons to When Harry Met Sally and to Same Time, Next Year. But this book isn't as good as either of those stories.     The characters are either boring, annoying, or both. I didn't understand why Emma was waiting around for Dexter to grow up either. And he never really did, at least not for very long.     The literary device used intrigued me at first because I thought the story would be about how their relationship developed AFTER they got together. That would have been refreshing and more interesting to read. Instead the story goes on and on and on about how messed up Dexter's life is and how worse it becomes.    PET PEEVE: I definitely didn't understand his babysitting scene with his own daughter either, it stuck out at me more than the rest as being totally unrealistic. This takes place when his child is 6 weeks old and there's talk of solids? The mother goes on and on with him before she leaves for the evening about making sure to support the baby's head and then she's all twisting and he can't get her into a high chair? (That she wouldn't be able to \\"sit\\" in anyway because babies don't sit up really at that age, nor to they eat solid foods. It just left me thinking good god, this author has never even seen a six week old baby.  Yes I get it, baby is colicky and drives him crazy and he drinks blah blah blah, that part I got, but the other details were stood out as unnatural.      OK, that was a 'minor' scene in the novel and there's so much more to hate.  The fact that the reader keeps waiting and waiting for Dexter to grow up and that Emma seems only to exist in the novel to save a character we end up not caring if he is saved or not. The only one who can save this raging alcoholic and drug addict is himself. I hated the ending and that it went on for 5 chapters too long only to reveal that Dexter didn't grow up at all, STILL.    But if you loved this, go read more Nicholas Sparks and see his movies.  I, for one, will never read another of David Nicholls books again.  The only good thing I can say is, at least I didn't buy it.
B005KGPC4S|4.0|There are one or two \\"why'd Smith go that way\\" moments in the film (example: the kid who's in the weapon room would have played enough video games to know to shoot from the corner, but he is in an extreme situation; so I can let them pass), but other than that \\"Red State\\" is an intense movie. Very watchable, even if I had to have a friend in the room with me the first time I viewed the film because of all the violence. Rent if, like me, you can't wait for the theatrical release of the film. I can't wait to see \\"Red State\\" at the theater now.
B001P06GX4|5.0|very good toy!my 5 years old enjoyed it so much.can sit  up to 1 hour and play it.and his older siblings liked it.
B000784WMW|4.0|My sister requested this for her birthday, even though we had just watched the new version with Michael Fassbender, as she remembered it being much more true to the story.  And, of course, this miniseries enables much more of the story to be covered than in a two hour movie, I'll grant that.  But, for a couple of exceptions, this earlier version is far superior, in my humble opinion, than any other I've seen, which numbers about six or so.  It includes even the much-neglected scene where Rochester plays the gypsy fortune teller, trying to ferret out Jane's feelings about him, which he performs in a falsetto with much gusto.  The only things I had a problem with were, they left out one of the most moving scenes in the book, (SPOILER ALERT!)where Helen Burns dies next to Jane.  Why???  Also, Jane, in some scenes, tended to look far older than 18 years of age.  And, though his acting was quite good, trying to swallow the unearthly handsome Timothy Dalton as the \\"ugly\\" Mr. Rochester, was hard to get past sometimes.  In fact, in one scene, he's almost laughing as he describes himself as revolting to her.  He could revolt ME any time!  In any case, a great, fun watch of old friends.  Enjoy!
0792164903|1.0|In Depp's movie \\"Chocolat\\", we saw 'the religious folk' as the antagonist/bad guy/source of evil. I was not surprised to see that drum beat again. In this 'adaptation' , once again, the 'religious community' is not only impotent and invovled in the mind numbing gore, they are the 'source code'. \\"Only the darling white witch can save us\\". \\"All this business of Jesus having ultimate authority over any and all demonic powers...is crap\\"...the moral of the storyline here!<br />This is, of course, anti Christ mentality right out of the textbook on the subject.<br /><br />Our society seem blithely ignorant/unaware/indifferent/foolishly adolescent ...as in \\"gosh, I wish I was a youthful , gorgeous hunk, who had these terrifying powers\\"..as more and more and more occult movies regurgitate from tinsel town;<br />seeming not merely to frighten/alarm/amuse us with horror...but cause \\"us\\" ( not me ) to covet those powers...so we can cast spells, or simply devour all those 'who done us wrong'.<br /><br />These are dangerous levels of pure deceit. Yes, the production values are<br />positively stellar ~ a visually compelling foray into dull grey, dark horror. Novices should understand that all Hollywood scripts are designed to revel in the carnage committed interminably by a Charicature of Evil...until the very last moments...as if to permit us to say, after beating our head against a brick wall..\\"Boy it feels good to stop doing that!<br /><br />Oh yes, by all means, take the malleable teenage mind and MOLD it. VEry carefully instruct them that \\"a white witch is where the real power is\\"...\\"forget all this balderdash about a supposed son of God with power over evil\\"<br />\\"Oh gosh, thank you, Satan...phew...I almost beleived in that balderdash. Thank you for 'saving me'  You are our real and true savior \\".....not.<br /><br />Johhny...you've led , supposedly, an enviable life of fame and wealth. It has served only to 'arrest' you into a permanent state of 9 year old boy.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Sure, Star Wars is his creation and you can do whatever you want to your creations.  The only thing is, if you are going to release a BD version of a movie that has had multiple changes, INCLUDE THE OPTION TO STILL BE ABLE TO WATCH THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSIONS!  A BD disc is 50GB.  Don't tell me that there was absolutely NO way they could have added those in?    I'm so sick of George Lucas and his pandering.  I will not buy, download or even watch these newly changed versions.

B002ZG99TK|4.0|A very good action movie. For the younger generation it has an excessive amount of profanity which I don't  believe was necessary. The acting was good, but   some of the scene sequences could have been improved.  Avid train fans probably will find the movie very   imteresting. I am a railroad fan and I would recommend  it to most adults that are interested in trains. However, I do not believe this film qualifies for  children viewing.

0375831002|5.0|As an author myself, I am in awe of the beautiful prose found in the Book Thief. Though I at first found the style a bit awkward, it quickly grabbed me by the throat and propelled me through the incredibly haunting story of Liesel Meminger. . . as viewed through the eyes of Death. Reading the back cover copy, I thought it would be a bit cheesy to have the narrator be Death, but Zusak--for lack of better wording--humanized Death. For me, it was very well done. Incredibly intelligent crafting.<br /><br />While some of the language was a bit over the edge at times, there was far too much good in the story, the writing, the book, that the cursing was almost a moot point. I am glad to see a current writer exploring and keeping alive the brutality of what happened in WWII.<br /><br />Overall, an authentic, heart-wrenching read. I do believe THE BOOK THIEF has topped the list of \\"Favorite Books\\" for me. I am left weighted by the poignancy, challenged by the stunning prose, and changed through the beautiful celebration of life that peeks past Death's grip.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|If you haven't' seen this movie... Crawl out from the rock you've been living under, run to the nearest computer, log onto Amazon.com and purchase this movie.<br /><br />\\"Shouldn't I rent it first\\" might be popping into your head... \\"NO\\" is my answer. You could, but you'll want to end up buying it anyways... so save yourself the trouble and just buy it.<br /><br />THANK GOD for this movie... it has saved the Batman franchise, after the last two prior movies.<br /><br />This movie is who and what Batman is. It's almost like the characters walked off the comic-book pages to film a movie.

B0054N73EY|5.0|In a world where actual good new MUSIC is hard to find, the Red Hot Chili Peppers once again show that some bands still care about making good music, and albums for that matter. Not to fear, just because John is not present on this album doesn't mean it's crap, in fact it's quite the opposite. This is one of the most satisfying albums I've heard this year, along with the Foo's Wasting Light. The Chili Peppers have really gone to a new direction on this album, maybe an acquired taste for some but for the most part, it really works well. New guitarist Josh Klinghoffer may not be as flashy or resilient as John is, but his unique rhthymic style suits quite well, he has some very nice fills on album. If anything, it's Anthony and Flea who stand out most on this album, Anthony's vocal's are quite amazing for going on 30 years of singing and Flea is great as ever, whether throwing down a sick bassline like on Factory of Faith or showing his new-found piano skills on Even You Brutus? And how can we forget Chad? Solid as ever and playing in two bands recording albums the same year!? You go man,(can't wait to hear Chickenfoot III).  This album is just bursting with diversity and really needs more listens to truly appreciate it, but it should defiantely be on anyone's list for 'Best albums of 2011.'
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I have heard the music and I have seen this live.  The movie adds more insight into the history of how the Phantom came to be which I found very compelling.  The talent level is superb.  This is one of those very rare movies I will watch a couple times a year because it is very moving, and very well executed.  If you have any doubts about getting the movie, that it somehow is just not the same as the original live version, I would advise you not to worry - this is a wonderful collection to anyone's library, and to this viewer, an essential one I will always treasure.

0061784788|5.0|I love James Rollins and the Sigma Force novels. They are partly the inspiration for my own ARKANE novels. I've read all of them and one of my favorite characters is Painter Crowe, and this book features him in a starring role, so of course I was desperate to read it. Excitingly, I was on a business trip to Montreal so I got it ahead of the British market!<br /><br />The book opens in the past with the finding of a gold-lined skull that is taken to Thomas Jefferson even as the team are attacked by what seem to be native Americans. The book then skips to the present day when two young men trespass an ancient site filled with mummified remains and this gold skull that had been hidden and protected for centuries. Murder and suicide start the adventure that soon escalates to a devastating explosion that rocks the native american community, sparking racial tensions and then an ecological disaster as the explosion site forms some kind of anti-matter that disintegrates everything in it's path. It's caused by a kind of ancient nanotechnology and the initial explosion starts to set other events in motion.<br /><br />Sigma's Painter Crowe goes to help his niece Kai who was implicated in the explosion, and is drawn into the hunt for the material that caused it as well as the lost Devil Colony, the 14th tribe that disappeared into history. Meanwhile the bad guys headed by Frenchman Rafael San Germaine are also trying to stop Painter and get to the locations of the artefacts themselves.<br /><br />At the same time, the assassin Seichan has reappeared with a lead on Echelon, the leaders of the Guild, Sigma's eternal bad guys, who Seichan once worked for. This search takes her and Gray Pierce into the National Archives to investigate the Great Seal. Their search begins to parallel Painter's as the climax approaches.<br /><br />So it's quite a complicated plot with many strands, but as ever, I enjoyed learning something new. I know very little about native american history or the early colonial history so it was interesting to read about aspects of this. I personally focus more on European history so this was new for me - or at least expanded on the pretty shocking National Treasure movies and Dan Brown with aspects of the Great Seal, founding fathers and early american history. As usual, Rollins ties in snippets of truth with his fast-paced story which for me is what makes a great thriller. '<br />The book also ties into the bigger picture of of the Guild vs Sigma as well as the developing relationship of Seichan and Gray as well as snippets of other characters we have come to love like Monk and Kat. I also enjoyed the strange tie between the evil Rafe and silent, deadly Ashanda which rounded them out as characters.<br /><br />So it's another great book by Rollins - if you love action-adventure thrillers, you'll be wanting this one!as interesting to read about aspects of this.

030746363X|5.0|I purchased this book in hardcopy and kindle formats just so I could always have it handy. After working out for 8 months, I had an emergency appendectomy which greatly curtailed my exercise. Thankfully I read 4HB and with the simple suggestions in the fat loss chapters I am in probably the best shape of my life! Ironically (to me) to came mostly from changing my diet and with only a little actual exercise. This book is worth its weight in gold and I have only read the fat loss chapters! This winter perhaps I will try out the muscle/strength chapters.    Thanks Tim. You helped me change my life.  PS. I only knew of this book because I had read 4-Hour Work Week prior to the 4HB release.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|I bought this album several days after the release date itself. The album is fully a dance-club anthem, however, sporadically infused with a myriad of other genres like Techno, Heavy Metal & Rock etc. Each individual track shines on its own way and are all very different. I really enjoy the instrumentals a lot and not forgetting Lady Gaga's phenomenal vocals. The lyrics mark the work of a genius, with many perspective and interpretations on the meaning of each song. Personally, my few favorite tracks off the album are \\"Judas\\", \\"Bloody Mary\\", \\"Hair\\" & \\"Yoü & I\\". However, I still love every single track on the album. On the overall, this album is fantastic! Everyone should listen to it!
030788743X|4.0|If you've ever fallen in love with a video game this is the book for you.  And if you like movies and tunes from the 1980s then you are in for an even bigger treat.  But you don't have to enjoy video games to enjoy \\"Ready Player One.\\"    The premise of the book is that when billionaire game developer, James Halliday, dies in the year 2044 he leaves the world with the ultimate quest...the first person to beat his game will inherit his entire estate. People from around the world stop their lives to try to beat the game.  Since Halliday loved the 1980s his game is filled with references to 1980s pop culture.     The game as well as much of the book takes place in \\"the Oasis\\" (think a more robust, virtual reality version of the internet).  What makes this book unique is that Mr. Cline pulls off the amazing feat (to a non-gamer like me) of making video games sound interesting and exciting.  And what makes the book so much fun are the 1980s pop culture references and the likeable characters.
B0026RHR6K|2.0|Love the series, that's not the issue.  If you are considering the box set for purchase, you are probably already a fan of the show, so nevermind that.     I want to echo the comments here about the lame packaging.  After shelling out so much money for this collection, the customer should at least have some confidence that their purchase can be preserved in some way: not this hodgepodge of paper packaging that not only leaves your discs vulnerable, but actually accelerates wear and tear from their flimsy design.  The simple act of removing a disc from the package is a risky challenge.    But none of this compares to the shoddy compression of this entire set.  I work in this industry, and recognize that what people are complaining about in their reviews is not the \\"realism\\" of shaky cameras and grainy film stock, but rather the glitchy compression that poorly adapts for low-light, high-contrast scenes.  With the combination of shooting with fluorescents and smoke, what should have been highly tuned compression settings were apparently not even bothered with, perhaps opting for faster adaptive mechanisms.  Please note that even some vfx shots (actually many in the course of an episode) are muddy, noisy, and flicker.  The color grading on the entire series was rather unique, probably shooting under exposure for more creative options in post-production.  However, as wild as much of the grading is, you would have thought somebody in the post pipeline had notes on final compression.    Not all of it is bad--if it were, somebody on the distribution team may have noticed and corrected it.  However, the sloppiness is apparent enough that it contrasts starkly with the gorgeous images that were properly treated.    Very disappointing.  I don't know if they made fixes in other releases, but this Blu Ray collection is a slapdash treatment of an elegant product.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Screens lock up often on my DroidX.  This is not with the battery usage. I'll look at it again if the issue is resolved but it's been uninstalled.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|Yes, it is possible to upgrade to the full Amazon version, but you have to root your Iconia to accomplish that.  Even then, it took quite a few attempts.  After rooting, you of course have to uninstall the original DTG.  You need a root uninstaller to accomplish that.  I found that although the uninstall appears to be successful, the tablet still believed that it was a native application.  Cleaned up pieces... like com.dataviz foler.  Still no go without more attempts.  Seems like the key was to ensure that you attempt the install from the amazon marketplace of the basic (free) app and once you are able to accomplish that successfully, then you can buy the upgrade.      Don't bother buying the upgrade till you are successful with the above.  Remember you have to root to make any progress.
B00402FGEE|5.0|This is a review for the entire series (two seasons). I watched only the first season in high definition (Blu-ray).<br /><br />STARGATE UNIVERSE (SGU) has attractive qualities that made it more than just worth my while. I honestly do not believe I had anything better to do than watch it. It had adult drama, an assortment of well-portrayed characters, imaginative elements of science fiction, respectable special effects, and forty episodes, none of which were bad, some of which were exciting and even suspenseful, with secondary stories embedded in one overall storyline.<br /><br />But what I appreciated most of all were the dedicated efforts by screenwriters, directors, actors, and actresses to be serious. Absent are Scotty's beaming into the water system and Kirk's comically fat hands (STAR TREK). Missing is the pod racer who steps out of his mangled racer, dusts himself off, and walks away without a scratch (STAR WARS EPISODE 1). There is no Gaius Baltar with mannerisms that become silly to a degree of asininity (BATTLESTAR GALACTICA). SGU is treated with a respect that I appreciate soulfully.<br /><br />Art has two parts: the creator and the viewer. Sometimes for art to be good and for the viewer to play their part, the viewer must WANT the art to be good. A closed, defeatist attitude ends in defeat. As a viewer looking for something new and refreshing, I wanted SGU to be good. Also, I understood that every work of art is imperfect, unfinished, and revisable. I was tolerant.<br /><br />When I watched the first episode of SGU, I met a character named Eli Wallace. He was awful. He was supposed to be a genius, but he was a video gamer. How vain! How pathetic! And the very worst part of the original Stargate series, STARGATE SG-1, was those clownish characters like Dr. Lee, whom Eli reminded me of. Then again, I remembered initially despising Rodney McKay in STARGATE ATLANTIS, though eventually I had come to realize that the goodness of his character lay hidden beneath his annoying facade.<br /><br />I wanted SGU to be good, and I wanted some decent science fiction. So I hung in there with SGU's dark set decoration, to which I soon became accustomed. Too, I persevered with Eli. Eventually, thanks to hints in the dialog, I understood that Eli's shallow personality was a manifestation of his youth. He was only a teenager, big in stature, small in maturity. Forgivable. In fact all the main characters developed into likeable persons. Aboard the intergalactic starship Destiny, I became immersed in a gratifying alternate reality, an explorer of the universe.<br /><br />And though SGU's second season came to an end, it left me happy.d SGU to be good, and I wanted some decent science fiction.

Growing up i saw the classic and this is by far the best retake of the original and making it more modern and new age.

I really enjoyed this movie and I would highly recommend it to a friend or family for that matter.
B004G600A4|5.0|I bought this video for my 2.5 year old based on my coworker's recommendation.    But, after watching, it's not suitable for most 2 year olds.  There are some \\"scary\\" scenes throughout including a couple of scenes where the primary male character (Flynn Rider) is chased by the King's knights and they shoot arrows at him, narrowly missing him.    Rapunzel's fake mom (Mother Gothel) also threatens characters with a knife and toward the end of the movie even stabs the young man (Flynn) that Rapunzel has fallen in love with, nearly killing him.    There are some less scary, but violent scenes as well, though they're not gory.    For older kids and adults it's a very good movie, which is why I've rated it 5 stars.    I like that the Rapunzel is not a submissive, giggly, weak princess whose only talent or strength is looking beautiful like you see from the princesses in some of the older Disney movies.

B001OMJGD0|3.0|Apart from Brandon Routh I haven't noticed anything super in this movie.  I think he was perfect as Superman but can't say the same thing about Lois.  I'm not saying \\"Let's get Angelina\\" but they could have done better.  Kevin Spacey is always great but supernatural villain would have been nice, like Doomsday, or Brainiac.  Superman Returns is not as bad as Tim Burtons Batmans, but clearly not even close to Nolan's Batmans.  I think DC should cut the nostalgic ties with the old movies and make some serious Superman movies.  I hope that's what they'll do in the new movie \\"Man of Steel\\" which is scheduled for 2013.

B005KGPC4S|5.0|QT said it and I also will do the same, although it may not carry the same merrit.    I will tell you why but first I must say this is the first movie that sent me on an emotional thrill ride. First I was terrified because these people were nuts. Some of it reminding me about the people in WBC although I dont think they are on this level. Second I was like \\"Hell Yeah\\" because the action was awesome., Lastly I was laughing cause some of the dialougue near the end was hilarious. Not because it was bad, but because it was meant to be funny.      Michael Parks is utterly terrifying. I couldnt tell if he was a maniacal genious or just plain Crazy. This brings me to the fact that I have heard and seen a few reviews say the writing was lazy. If it was and wasnt intentional, it still works. The writing does have a B movie feel at times, but the way it is delievered makes it amazing. I couldnt help but imagine I was in this situation and was cheering for the good guys in the end. The other thing I heard was the ending was weak. I partially agree with this but the more and more I think about it, it worked. It wrapped the movie up the way only Kevin Smith can do. I will put it all on the line and say this movie is one of a kind. Definitely not something ever put out by KS. but something he needs to do more of.    I leave you on this..... IF YOU DONT SEE THIS, YOU WILL BE MISSING ONE OF THE FUNNEST MOVIES IN AWHILE. Definitely makes one of my top 10.
B000FCK42M|5.0|This is fiction so the names and places do not correspond directly with the actual events during this piece of War on Drugs history, but the research quality is outstanding.    The War on Drugs was a misguided effort in the 80s to cut off the supply side of the drug problem that was and is plaguing America, especially the poor inner city residents of America. The problem however is that Drugs are a demand-led issue in the US. And if people demand them, enterprising criminals will supply them regardless of the laws in place.     This book looks intelligently at what happens when you run into the law of unintended consequences. During the War on Drugs the US DEA and Special Forces units operated from Columbia all the way through to Mexico. Operations were executed (as were gang members) but due to the law of unintended consequences augmented by terrible US intelligence and abject government corruption in the latin countries, the War on Drugs arguably made things worse. The flow of drugs had a few hiccups but there are more drugs flooding into the US now over the Mexican border than at any time in history. The Mexican government is entirely owned by the major cartels now. The Policia and Federales are just branches of the cartel, leaving only the Army relatively untouched.     This is a fascinating fictional take on how all this went down. Highly readable - Get it!
0425242099|4.0|Kiss of Snow is book ten (I can't believe is already book 10) of the Psy-Changeling series by Nalini Singh.<br /><br />Since the Lauren family's defection from the Psy Net the SnowDancer wolf pack has offer them refuge and protection.<br />From the moment Sienna Lauren laid eyes on the alpha of the pack, Hawke, she felt an immediately attraction and connection with him, Hawke felt it too; but Sienna was just a young teenager, not a match or a prospect for man like Hawke.<br />Years have passed and their attraction hasn't change. The difference in age is still present and the frustration for not acting upon it is growing with an alarming increment. Everyday that passes Hawke is becoming more irascible and jealous and Sienna is acting out as a result of this neglection. Sienna wants Hawke to see her as the woman she has grown to be and needs him to make his mind, to make her his or to let her go. She cannot continue living not knowing what to expect from him. Hawke wants to act upon her feelings but he is afraid of loving her. His mate died at a very young age and he thinks he doesn't have much left to offer Sienna.<br />Psy council is crumbing, a war is forming on the horizon and the packs are going to be in the middle of all the chaos. Now they need to be more prepared than ever, acting as a whole unit to be able to defect what is coming their way.<br /><br />Kiss of Snow was one of my most anticipated books of this year. I was literally counting the days for its release and it didn't disappoint me.<br />I felt in love with Hawke since the first time he made an appearance in this series. While I was waiting patiently for his story to come my love for him grew book by book. I wanted him so badly to have his HEA but I was a little bit afraid of Sienna as his heroine, not because she wasn't interesting or strong enough, but because of her age. I didn't know how Mrs. Singh was going to pull it off for them to work together and was a little bit apprehensive of the idea, but after reading Kiss of Snow all my misgivings were laid to rest. Mrs. Singh did a spectacular job with the development of the characters and now I think Sienna is the perfect mate for Hawke, just the kind of woman he needed.<br /><br />Talking about Sienna she was so stubbornly strong, don't take me wrong, it was in a good way, she needed to be like that; getting what she wanted from Hawke was not an easy task but she was determined and didn't want to settle for less than what she deserved. The story behind her is a heart breaking one and knowing she survived it with her innocence intact and with fire in her heart proves us what kind of woman our loving alpha is getting settle with.<br /><br />Hawke, Hawke, Hawke, where can I start? He beautiful, he is sexy, he is strong, he is loyal, he is sex on a stick. He is a man/wolf with a big heart but with many scars in it. We learn about his past, his family, his child mate. He is a strong alpha but at the same time he is a man afraid to love, afraid of feeling too much and getting hurt.<br /><br />Sienna and Hawke's relationship felt right. I loved how Hawke was patient with Sienna and gave her the time she needed it, but at the same time I loved his possessiveness. The tension between this two was building page by page but every time things were going to go a little bit further something was happening, the phone was ringing, there was a knock at the door or something like that, preventing and distracting them from their \\"task\\" at hand. It happened so much, that it felt a little bit too much. I was almost screaming at the book \\"enough\\" don't answer the phone or the door, let the world collapse around you but don't stop.<br /><br />Another character who played a big role was Sienna's uncle Walker Lauren. In this book we see another side of him. He is the pillar of the family, the one who kept them sane and his strength was what helped them escape. We also learn more from him and his life in Silence up to the moment of their defection. A secondary romance occurs between him and Lara, the healer of the pack. Their romance was very sweet, and after learning Walker story I was very glad he got his HEA. This little romance was also a nice addition to the plot.<br /><br />Another character I loved in this book was Sienna's little brother Toby. He is a very lovely little guy. I loved his connection with Sienna. He may be just a little child but he has the fortitude of an adult.<br />One of my favorite scenes in the book was between him and Hawke, it was really too cute for words.<br /><br />Sasha and Lucas also played an important part with their little addition to their family. Lucas is still the over protective Alpha but this time there are more reasons to be like that.<br /><br />I have always had my doubts about Nikita and \\"her Silence\\" and this book proved my suspicious right. I really liked her and my heart aches for her.<br /><br />We also see other characters from previous books, from the mated couples to the single ones and young ones we love.<br /><br />Kiss of Snow was what I was expecting it to be and more. As always Mrs. Singh writing had me glued to its pages from beginning to end.<br />Kiss of Snow is a great addition to this series. I recommend this book to all Paranormal Romance readers. It can be read as a stand alone but there is so much history and build up between the characters and their world that it will be almost a sacrilege to read it like that.the healer of the pack.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|I was honestly surprised how much I enjoyed watching the new trilogy again.  With all the expectations gone, it works great watching them back to back to back.  It doesn't make the plot holes or bad dialogue better, but it's enjoyable.  If you're on the fence, it'd be tough to reccommend.  But if you're a Star Wars fan, you won't be disappointed.    The films look beautiful and the bonus features are pretty interesting... I would have loved to get digital copies or more docs that were oddly left out, but the set still works and provides plenty of entertainment.  And as for the infamous \\"no\\"... when watched as a trilogy or as the saga, it's pretty inconsequential and didn't bother me at all.    Glad I bought this.
0756405890|4.0|Kvothe is a legendary hero, loved and hated for many. Legends had been written in his name, but which one held the true to the different events? That, nobody knows.<br />The Chronicler a famous scribe is tracking down Kvothe; he wants to be the one to tell the real story of this famous character.<br />By unexpected circumstances The Chronicler and Kvothe crossed paths, resulting in The Chronicle arrival to Kvothe's inn. Kvothe has been living, as an innkeeper in a little town for a couple of months under an alias, just his apprentice Bast, knows who he really is.<br />But The Chronicler soon recognizes Kvothe and pleads to him to tell him his real story. He wants to be the one who tells it to the world.<br />After some consideration Kvothe agrees. He tells The Chronicle it will take three days for him to relate everything. All the details are settled and Kvothe starts almost immediately to narrate his life events, beginning with his childhood and moving along until his time at The University.<br />In this book we see all the events in Kvothe's childhood, it was not an easy one. Many dramatic events unfold through the pages.<br />His life changes drastically after his parents and friends are killed by The Chandrian. He goes from being a loved and cherished child to a beggar and pickpocket in the streets of an unknown city.<br />But Kvothe is smart and he knows it; he has also a very driven personality. After three years in the streets he wakes up of his stage of shock and decides he had mourned enough the dead of his parents. He now wants revenge. He is going to kill The Chandrian, but he doesn't know anything about them. First he needs to learn about them to be able to find their weak points (if there are any) to kill them. He decides his best option is to go to The University to learn everything he requires. He does whatever is necessary to get accepted in The University and after being accepted he would need to do whatever is necessary to stay there until he learns what he needs to learn.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind is the first book of The Kingkiller Chronicle Trilogy. Each book in this trilogy will belong to a day of Kvothe's storytelling.<br /><br />Kvothe is a very mysterious character, as a child we see him as clever and gifted kid; not just with his studies but with everything he does, especially with music. As an adult others see him almost as a god-like hero. Many legends and stories are written about him. But in this book we don't know yet about them.<br />Bast is something non-human. Maybe Fae, but we are not sure what he really is. The only thing certain about him is his love and devotion for Kvothe.<br />The Chronicle is an interesting character; he is a well-known scribe, but not much is said about him. I think there is more to him and he will surprise us in the books to come.<br />I like Kvothe's friends Simmon and Wilem from The University; they are nice supporting characters. They love him and accept him the way he is, and they really care for him.<br />I couldn't connect with Denna nor did I understand the attraction Kvothe felt for her. I hope in the next books I could see it more clearly.<br /><br />My final though: This is a long book, over 700 pages but it's so well written and entertaining that you won't feel it. The changes from present to pass are expertly done.<br />The world building is amazing, is not just original but made in a very detail manner. I finished the book couple of days ago and still I just need to close my eyes to picture every city and room in this book.<br />The Name of the Wind has a nice pace; also Mr. Rothfuss is a master at storytelling. He gives us little glances of things that would happen in the future, keeping us glued to the pages because we want to know when and how these things would happen.<br />If you love Fantasy, you will love this book. Book two of The Kingkiller Trilogy, The Wise Man's Fear was released this month. I hope to read it soon. This one it's over thousand pages.

0345522478|5.0|Hounded is book one of the Iron Druid Chronicles series by Kevin Hearne.<br /><br />Atticus O'Sullivan is a 2100 year old druid (yes, you read right 2100!) who looks like a 21 year old college kid. He is the owner of a bookstore/apothecary in Temple, Arizona. Atticus chose Temple as his perfect place to live because of its low magic population.<br />Atticus has been on the run since he took possession of a magic sword, infuriating a Celtic god over a millennia ago. Aenghus &Oacute;g hasn't forgiven Atticus and wants to recuperate the sword no matter the consequences or means necessaries to obtain it.<br />But now things are different, Atticus is tired of running, he likes his life, his job and his new friends and is willing to finally affront the consequences of his actions. Atticus knows he has become very powerful over the years and a match against Aenghus &Oacute;g will be an even match. Atticus is also not alone, he has friends he can count on when the need arise.<br /><br />Hounded is one of the best urban fantasy books I had read this year and one of the few books I have read from a male point of view. Sometimes is difficult for a female reader to connect with a male character, especially when the book is written by a man. This was not the case with Atticus in Hounded. Mr. Hearne writes Atticus so well and so real that soon he becomes your buddy and you are cheering for him page after page wanting him to succeed in his endeavors.<br /><br />Atticus may be old as dirt, but he has learned to blend so well with his surroundings that just in rare occasions he feels his real age. Atticus is sexy, strong, wise and with a great sense of humor. He also has unlimited stamina thanks to his magic, nice! I picture him exactly as the model in the cover... what can I say... Can I have him?<br /><br />The secondary characters in Hounded are all great, unique, varied and fun. From vampire, gods, goddesses, witches, to widows, werewolves and more. But Oberon, Atticus' Irish wolfhound steals the spotlight. I loved that he can communicate with Atticus. Oberon is a smart dog who can maintain a conversation and I loved that despite this he still thinks and behaves like a dog. His fixation with French poodles, sausages and Genghis Khan was completely hilarious.<br /><br />The world created by Mr. Hearne is very inventive and interesting. Not all the characters are new, Mr. Hearne \\"recycle\\" old and known deities in a very smart way, giving them a fresh feeling. I loved how so many different characters intermingle in a very creative and extraordinary way.<br /><br />Hounded is non-stop, page turner book, packed with action, intrigues, manipulations, humor and witty remarks; with great characters and a very well developed plot.<br />I loved the unconventional references used by Mr. Hearne. Who could thing think that Shakespeare and Star Wars could fusion so well in a story.<br /><br />Hounded is one of those books that you won't be able to put down until you reach its last page, and when you do reach it, you will start looking for the next installment, Hexed, because you loved Hounded so much that you would want to continue reading more about Atticus and his friends, and this is not because Hounded ends in a cliff hanger, because it doesn't, it is just because Hounded was so good and you loved it so much and found it so refreshing from other books that you will crave for more of Mr. Hearne's words.<br /><br />I recommend this book to all urban fantasy lovers or anyone who is willing to give a chance to a good and different book.<br /><br />I won this book in a giveaway organized by The Qwillery. Mr. Hearne was so kind as to sent me a signed copy. YAY!

B00475BUVM|4.0|I agree with those who say the 3-D was a waste of time but, that doesn't mean it deserves a 1 star rating! The 3-d was not necessary at all, the Clash of the Titans Story no matter how brief it is never needed 3-D effects to work. Without 3-D it works just fine for an Action/Adventure movie. Hey let's face it the movie is short because the studio intended it to be an appetizer and hopefully raise enough interest in a sequel if it earned enough money in the box office. The Studios have a habit of doing this lately and they end up giving us a big budget sequel we end up not liking as much as the first. Comparing this remake to the original makes it look way better because the original was great back then but now that I'm older I can see all of the cheesyness and the cornyness clearly. If you take this as a stand alone Action/Adventure Fantasy you'll like it a lot but, if you waste your time making comparisons you'll be disappointed. Bottom Line for all its pro and cons I give this movie 4 stars and I recommend you to give this film a chance.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Dragon Bound is the first book in the new series Elder Races by Thea Harrison.<br /><br />Pia Giovanni a half-breed wyr, has lived all her life by the rules imposed by her mother, rules she set to protect her. But after her mother's dead and the pass of the years, Pia feels very lonely and trusts the wrong person, her boyfriend at the time, Keith. Pia realizes her mistake but it's too late. Keith is a gambler with many debts and now he has some leverage over her. Keith blackmails Pia with the secret information he has on her, forcing her to steal from the hoard of the most powerful being in the planet, Dragos Culebre. Keith never stipulates to her what to steal, just to get something from Dragos' horde for him to give to his \\"associates\\". When Pia enters the horde she takes a Penny from a jar she found in there. Pia knows this is the end for her; nobody does something like this to Dragos and lives to tell the tale.<br />After giving Keith the penny, Pia does the only thing left for her to do, to try to hide, running away from New York City.<br /><br />Dragos has lived since the creation of the universe. He is a wyr, more specifically a dragon shape shifter. If this is not enough he belongs to the most powerful of the Elders Races.<br />When Dragos discovers somebody had the nerve to steal from him, he is livid and cannot believe it happened; in all his existence nobody has ever succeed in taking anything from him. And when he realizes the one who did it was a woman, he makes her capture his mission. He founds her easily thanks to a note she left him in his horde, the note is written in the back of a receipt from a 7-11.<br /><br />Dragos wants to render Pia to pieces but when he finally gets to her, his anger melts away with just her mere presence. This young woman intrigues him deeply and he wants to discover what is about her that attracts him so much. Dragos also realizes Pia was just a pawn who was force to do it. Furthermore he learns there is a bigger player behind all this. Now his only focus is to get to this player and destroy him. But things are a little bit more complicated for Dragos, he feels he needs to protect Pia and this presents a distraction for him.<br /><br />Where to start with the praises for this book... yes, I said praises, because there isn't anything negative about it... ok, let's try to start with the characters.<br /><br />Pia Giovanni is a heroine you start to love since the first page of the book, she wants to feel loved and she wants to feel she belongs somewhere; all her life she has hidden her truth making her feel inappropriate. This doesn't take anything off from her, she is still a kick ass heroine with a feminine style. She is strong and direct. She stands for herself and doesn't back down. She is also kind of a mystery during a big part of the book and after her \\"revelation\\" she ends up been a beautiful and an unexpected surprise. She is an environmentalist and sometimes thinks more about others than herself. Plus she has a great sense of humor. So what's really not to like about her.<br /><br />Now about Dragos, mmm, yummy, mmm, dreamy, mmm, Dragos. Ok, let's try to be more specific, when the term Alpha male was created who ever created it had Dragos in mind as an example of the perfect Alpha male, and it may be possible, Dragos exists since the creation of the universe.<br />Dragos is also a protector, he is sexy as hell, he is also interesting in a very arrogant and dark way. He has lived since ever and sometimes technology or modern living are a challenge for him, making him more \\"human\\".<br /><br />Pia and Dragos relationship happens really fast but it was completely believable. Pia is afraid to love and Dragos doesn't know what love is, both are coming a long way and are willing to yield when necessary to get to where they need to get. Their conversations are fluid and humorous, with plenty of sarcasms and bantering to keep you entertain from beginning to end. Their attraction sizzle the pages and their \\"sexy time\\" will leave you wanting to be one of them (Pia in my case).<br /><br />The supporting characters are wonderful with great personalities and qualities. I love Dragos' friends especially Rune, Graydon and Tricks. Rune is always there for Dragos, he is his first in command and best friend. I loved Graydon, I loved that he was there for Pia when she nedded a friend the most. And Tricks, she was refreshing and funny, I loved the scene in which she had lunch with Pia, it was hilarious!<br /><br />The world building in Dragon Bound is superb, with many different variables (Fae, elves, wyr, different realms, etc) that intercept perfectly making it beautiful and realistic.<br />Mrs. Harrison writing is spotless and entangling. Dragon Bound has action, romance, and everything you will expect a great paranormal book to have.<br /><br />Dragon Bound is a fantastic book, it has become one of my all time favorite paranormal books.  I really cannot recommend it enough. Please listen to me and go and get your own copy NOW. You can thank me later.<br /><br />The next installment in this series, Storm Heart will be Tricks and Tiago's book.

B0035WTJFW|5.0|A must have for Blu-Ray it sounds great with the effects in the factory part of the movie.. and yes the film grain is noticeable but I rather have that then a soft image.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Alright, so I want to review this without giving into the vampire love bias that has possessed a good portion of the female race. When it comes down to it this show is spectacular. The writing improves more and more that you don't even think about how weak it was the first few episodes anymore. The acting...is better than you'd expect coming from a young adult CW show. The cast is gorgeous (Ian Somerhalder is the best part of the show). Can't wait for next season I see myself watching this show all the way to the end.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I understand that people are upset about these changes and i too think that they are completely unnecessary..... but that being said i think that people need to understand that these still are the movies we have loved since we were kids!! We still have the epic scenes from Empire when Luke meets his father for the first time and the epic fight scene that ensued... We still have the epic battles on endor and the death star...their are still the characters we have loved for so many years... These changes are things that are kids are going to grow up seeing no matter what... even if we don't buy these DVD's... This is now apart of the star wars saga weather we like it or not... These changes arent going to make me stop being a star wars and i hope that it isnt going to stop you...
B000WCDI64|5.0|Although the frequency of Amy's onstage drinking is unsettling to watch (and would be even if she were still here), the performance itself is critical and undeniable evidence of her original vocal abilities.  Even when inebriated near the end, her vocals were spot on, and her memory intact enough to carry on where most people wouldn't remember their own home address - even with their ID in their hand.<br /><br />It's said that everything is recycled, but the basic human endeavor/imperative is such that each artist, although an amalgam of what may have gone before, can stop time by focusing their individual filter and thus make a brand new reality.  Amy did that with her voice, her ability to connect to her audience, her sharp sense of songwriting and, maybe most dangerously, her willingness to share what must have been raw and painful events set to music.  Most of us can forget or re-write those times, and thus be saved by our own mediocrity.  She apparently didn't give herself that bit of grace, and even selected songs from other writers sharing hopelessness along those same poetic lines.  Singing these stories night after night was no cathartic exercise; it was pain on display the way people will slow down to view victims of a car accident.  The differences were the originality of her voice and the honesty of her words.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this disc also gives a clue about how powerful Amy would've become had she granted herself the perspective of a survivor believing in love, with a heart made all the more precious for the battered scars sustained in growth.  There will be other singers, but her brief time here will be remembered.  Thanks for the legacy, Miss Amy.
1594202710|4.0|Brilliant insights from Kissinger about China.  This book really enriched my understanding of the culture, people, and aims of the country.  Scary at some points, but also comforting in others.  I agree with another reviewer who said this will be the \\"go to\\" book on China.  It should be just exactly that.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I read the book and the movie is pretty close.  Although the women are Chinese, any mother or daughter can relate to this movie.  As a daughter you sometimes feel like we don't meet our mother's expectation.  As mothers we feel we have not given our daughters all that they need to succeed in life.  You will learn something when you see this movie, it is worth watching.

B0054N73EY|4.0|This is not a track-by-track deal, just a commentary on a very good album and attempt at a sequel to Blood Sugar Sex Magic.       Up until \\"Blood Sugar...\\" Flea's bass dominated every album.  Blood Sugar was a mix, with John Frusciante's guitar starting to take over (Under the Bridge, Breaking the Girl, etc.) certain aspects.  It was a perfect mix for the bands rock-funk-fusion style, and I still think their best album.    For obvious reasons, One Hot Minute was just an anomaly.  When Frusciante came back for Californication, it was again a mix of lead guitars, albeit much more mature sounding.  By The Way was dominated by Frusciante, and Stadium Arcadium was Frusciante's opus.  All three albums were great, but were rock albums containing a number of forgettable \\"funk filler\\" tracks, almost as a homage to their previous works.    This is a full-on effort to recapture the vein of Blood Sugar...and I think this album defines the \\"creative differences\\" cited as the reason Frusciante left the band.  The Chilis have never deprived him of his side and solo projects, so I don't buy into that as a reason he left.      Flea's ego permeates this album.  His opening baselines on almost every track almost come as reminders that he is, once again, the \\"lead guitarist\\" with his bass, and Klinghoffer's guitar, while terrific, is more wallpaperish and atmospheric than the dominating style Frusciante had developed and showcased on Stadium Arcadium.  Even the \\"piano tracks\\" feature, well, Flea, on piano.    That being said, it isn't like that is a bad thing.  Flea's bass lines are popping throughout the album, though no bass line he produces on here matches the darkness and ferocity of some of my favorite Flea bass lines, like on \\"Parallel Universe,\\" \\"Torture Me\\" or the end of \\"Charlie.\\"    \\"Brendan's Death Song\\" is unquestionably the best song on the album, in my opinion.  Given its acoustic nature through much of the song, it is Klinghoffer's showcase, his \\"Under the Bridge\\", so tospeak.  Vocally, Kiedis has never sounded better than this track, and given his questionable history of writing lyrics, I was pleasantly surprised at how good they are.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I put off watching this for a long time because re-makes are often not as enjoyable as the original, and can interfere with happy memories. In this case, I regret my loss: this movie is fully as heart-warming as the original - even more poignant, in my opinon. The martial arts displayed are of a much higher difficulty (amazing that kids can do those things) than the old movie, and the characters are different enough to be fresh.        The ending was perfect.        The Smith kid is amazing: he is NOT just a pretty face.  And Jackie Chan delivers his excellence, as always.         We're in luck: now we have two versions of a great story to enjoy.  Double the fun!
B005HJAOLY|3.0|[Later addition and warning: A commenter suggests this review includes a spoiler. I suppose it does now that it has been mentioned. However, the alleged spoiler in this case is that i reveal there's an evil man-eating thing in this story. As man-eating or man-destroying things are sort of a standard of most of King's macabre-genre work, I guess I figured that wasn't much of a spoiler. I apologize. Please be advised. I will say in my defense, however: I don't reveal who gets eaten and what happens to the eater and eatees.]<br /><br />I must admit. I purchased this to see if a King-penned short story was worth $3 as a Kindle Single.<br /><br />Quick review for a quick read: If you're a fan King's macabre stuff, you'll get your $3 worth (hey, it's what you'd pay for a gallon of gas at an abandoned interstate rest stop).<br /><br />If you aren't a seasoned King reader, you may not want to start out with this one as it takes a bit of practice to appreciate how well he can write the sounds of bones crushing.<br /><br />However, *if* you are a fan of King, you'll like it because no one does the car-eats-person at an abandoned Maine Interstate rest stop story like King.

B005D9MUWY|3.0|this app it's a great idea however I've run into several issues. One of which is the results of the speech to text completely disappearing and then showing up in another app later on like text messaging or email. Another issue is the text prediction is a little too aggressive especially when trying to input an email address or a word that's not in its database. If they fix those two issues then I will recommend this keyboard until then I will continue to use Smart Keyboard Pro.
B0015AARJI|1.0|This controller functions fine but it can't take any charge whatsoever. Paying forty dollars  for a control that must be plugged in is just ridiculous. I've tried three different chargers  and none of them will charge this control I have absolutely no clue why. Very disappointed  with this product.
B005AUWXZ0|2.0|I watched this in the theatre with my four and half year old son. While we had enjoyed Cars at home, this time we were disappointed. One might argue the movie is a bit too violent and sinister for kids his age but even as an adult I found the movie to be dreary - little substance under the fancy wrapping paper of high end graphics.There is a plot and an agenda but the presentation fails to deliver. My son didn't like the movie at all. This was a very different experience from watching Bugs Life, Monsters Inc and Toy Story with him.
B005DESVPO|3.0|First of all, I love Gary Clark Jr.  I think he's a tremendous talent, and has a very bright future in front of him.  Unfortunately, \\"Bright Lights\\" contains no new material.  These tracks and more have already been released as \\"Gary Clark Jr.\\".  Buy that one instead.  It's worth it for the extra tracks (a total of 8).  These are all good songs, but there's only 4 of them, and they aren't new.  The previous release has twice as much music on it. It seems like it's about time to release a full album's worth of new music from Gary.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|The angry birds games are definitely the best games I have gotten on my phone. This game is expansive, with regular updates and there is a lot of replay with collecting golden eggs and getting three stars.  The ads on the free version are very annoying but you have to make that sacrifice if you don't want to pay.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|If you follow Royce, you know he's back with Bad & Evil. Some of these songs are meh... some are addicting as hell. These guys are on top of the lyric game. Support them, buy it!
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|I can't even explain really.. how much this album has moved me. It has the metal we love, plus melodic songs, Jinxx's electric violin-- and still at times the screamo.<br /><br />The song Saviour is AMAZING and made me so shocked with love for it i played it on repeat a ton of times  (and still do!)<br />Rebel Love Sng is killer as is Fallen Angels.<br /><br />There IS NO songs on this album you WONT like! You can just let it ride and be thrilled with every single song.<br /><br />Buy it...<br />if you don't you'll be missing out on this years best new release!
1451629184|5.0|Definitely for an adult audience, this book was very well-writen and brings to life the reality of one victim and her experiences with two horrible human beings.  If her story interests you, her book will too.  I really enjoyed the fact that she wrote what happenned to her years ago as well as how she currently reflects upon them and how she's been affected by them.  This book shows her strength and determination on how she has overcome something terrible.
B001HN6922|1.0|My daughter had a playdate with a friend when we went to see this movie. They were 4 at this point. My daughter loves Cars the moive. We were always watching the movie at home. So when the ad came out for Cars2 we had to go see it. We went openning day so there was a lot of excitement. Half way through, my daughter began to cry because Lighting was hurting his best friend (Matter) feelings on purpose. Once she calmed down we decided to stay. She saw the cars getting crunched and realized that they were being killed. When she saw that Matter had died she began to cry and wanted to go home. Matter does survive but to her, she thought he had died. Her friend just wanted to leave the whole time and wasn't interested in the movie. The exciting day became an emotional nightmare. To this day if she sees anything related to Cars 2 she wants to leave or tells me how much she hated the movie.   It is sad to see that Pixar was to concerned with keeping the parents attention and not the childrens.     Bottom line, to much fighting, abusive behavior to friends, shoting and killing in the movie. Save your money and rent it first to make sure it is something your kids will enjoy.
B004ULEEY8|4.0|The product came in excelent conditions, ,i'm very pleased with this bluray, the movie is awesome ans the quality of the image is perfect

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I'm 37, fan of the SW movies since I was a kid. In my lifetime, I've probably bought the original movies probably 5 times? What with VHS, DVDs, special editions, and box sets.  Now, blu-ray. I can't believe I'm saying it, but as much I love these movies there's not a chance in hell I'm putting up with (once again) this altering of a classic movie (for no good reason) and then dishing out more money.  Even in 97 the changes were questionable... the further changes in 2004 were even more questionable... and from what I've read, the changes in the blu-ray are the last straw.  The hell with it.
B004Z8ZFAI|4.0|This movie was as much fun the second and third times as it was the first time we all watched it.
0756404746|4.0|I was going to give this a worse rating, but having read a bunch of other fantasy books recently, I decided that in comparison Rothfuss deserves the extra star.  This is fantasy an adult can read without groaning, at least.  While the plot is a bit over-familiar (young boy is orphaned and abandoned, discovers he has special skills, goes on to be a hero), Rothfuss has added enough twists to make it reasonably engaging.  Kvothe (ugh -- why do fantasists think that inhuman sounding names make things more interesting?  though Rothfuss doesn't fall into that trap too badly) is at least a non-traditional sort of hero.  He's not clearly saving the world, for example.  So props for that.  Rothfuss's writing is also good, and he does dialogue well for the most part (with one hideous exception where the hero meets a swineherd and Rothfuss decides to try his hand at dialect.  Fail!)  Unlike too many other authors, he does create and describe a world that feels believable.  My one major complaint is the glacial plot.  Lots of mysteries are raised, but 650 pages later the plot has not moved any closer to resolution.  It's one thing to take some time to paint a rich background for the characters and their world, it's another to do that at the expense of any forward narrative movement.  I'm simply not sure I want to make the commitment to finding out what happens, because I think it's going to be thousands and thousands more pages before we get anywhere, and the writing, while good, isn't that good.  That is, I like the world and the characters well enough for one long book, but I'm not at all sure I like them enough to stay with them for the long haul over what promises to be lots of volumes.  Thousands more pages and I'm pretty sure I'll be skipping ahead to see what actually happens, because all the rest is starting to feel like filler.  There are other minor criticisms of the book.  The characters, especially the female characters, often act older than they are.  Or perhaps it's that the minor characters react to the major characters (hero and love interest) in ways they would not really treat people of that age, no matter how mature they were for their ages.  Their motivations don't always ring entirely true either.  And certain inconsistencies do weave themselves into the book.  But all these are relatively minor.  If you're willing to make the commitment, the series is probably worthwhile.  Certainly, it's better than a great deal of other fantasy writing out there.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I see people saying it feels cheap you paid 30 dollars for it what do you expect. You people kill me.

B004QPOVF0|5.0|I have been a fan of AC/DC/ for over 30 years. I listen to them everyday while I draw my graphic novels. I listen to both the Bon Scott and Brian Johnson eras. I love them both. I guess you have figured that I have every CD they ever recorded.<br />After their last CD before Black Ice, all I wish for for years was please just one more AC/DC CD. Well in 2008 I go my wish. Black Ice was released. It may sound crazy but I'd never been to one of their concerts.It's a long story. Well along with the new CD, this was probably going to be my last chance to see them. I actually got the tickets 10 seconds before they were sold out at Madison Square Garden. I was one of the best monents of my life. When their tour ended, the next thing I wished for was a live CD for the Black Ice tour. It didn't come out. They released the DVD instead, I never bought a DVD of AC/DC before because I was hartbroken that I never got to see them live. I order the DVD. and it was incredible in brought me back to Madison Square Garden. This thing is increadible! I have allready bought 5 for friends. Now I have so many  other DVDS to get from the best group in the history of rock and roll! Man, life is great with AC/DC in it. I will never forget them and just maybe they will do it again for me one more time. You have got to get this DVD. Even the teenagers today still listen to them. They are imortal! I'll stop now.

B001EN71DG|5.0|In 1994 George Lucas was abducted by aliens. Ever since, his ditsy clone has been busy retooling while simultaneously destroying the Star Wars (and Indy) franchise. With every re-release, Lucas II has been blurring the line between Star Wars and Spaceballs. His Blu-Ray release is the final straw.     There's a good reason that this set is selling for more than the Blu-Ray sets. This is the only box set that contains digital copies of the original, unaltered Star Wars trilogy. Each movie is basic 2.1 sound and 720 x 272 resolution. While the quality is not great, this trilogy is a classic and should be treated as such. In this version, Han will still shoot first (and last), ghost Anikan doesn't grow younger, and Vader will never scream \\"NO\\"!     With this set, your childhood is preserved forever. And as a bonus, this set also comes with the re-released editions on separate discs. They make excellent coasters.
1853261580|5.0|This book was delievered to me in a speedy fashion and in a great condition. You can't beat the price also.
0062060554|5.0|I picked this book up based on all of the recommendations and 5 star ratings on here and I'm so glad I did! The story is very original - a woman who wakes up every morning with all memories from the last 20 years ago forgotten - and it had me flying through the pages at a rapid pace. There's only a handful of characters so you get to know each of them very well as the story progresses (from Christine's confused point of view at least). It is extremely suspenseful and is one that really made me want to keep reading to find out what happens next. The ending was a little predictable but still came as a bit of a surprise as it was unravelling.<br /><br />As I am from England, my only complaint about the book (as others have also mentioned) is the fact that this is set in London and the characters are English - even the author is English - yet there are so many Americanisms all the way through (e.g. \\"parking lot\\" \\"soccer\\" \\"peanut butter and jelly\\" - all words that English people never use), so it does get pretty irritating.<br /><br />I won't let that small complaint about poor editing get in the way of a top score for this excellent book though. This is one of the best debuts I have read in years and I'll add my recommendation to the rest.
B003UESJHO|5.0|I know the mean streets of Lowell, Massachusetts, although of late that geographical reference point would center on a more literary sense of the place around the figure of 1950s beat novelist/poet Jack Kerouac. I do not, by the way, mean that I know Lowell from actually growing up in that old-time textile mill town that has seen better days, mainly. I mean I know Lowell because I know the double-deckers, the triple-deckers, the seedy bowling alleys, the back lot gyms, the mom and pop variety stores, the ethnically-tinged bars, biker hang-outs, and flop houses that dot that working class town and form the backdrop to the cultural life of that place. I grew up on the southern side of Boston in North Adamsville. That past its prime working class town (formerly a shipbuilding center rather than Lowell's textile but they shared the same ethos) had its full compliment of tight housing, rundown stores, sparse entertainment possibilities and cramped view of life's prospects just like Lowell.     I know Mickey Ward (Wahlberg) and, more importantly, I know Dickie Eklund (Bale) and their mother Alice (Leo). I do not mean that I know any of them personally but I know their ilk. See North Adamsville also had its fair share of club fighters (or other sports king wanna-bes), working out of some third floor back door gym that smelled of tiger's balm and other liniments, looking to make it out of the dead-end town and on to the big tent, whether they actually left North Adamsville or not. And most didn't and most did not even get a shot at hitting someone like Sugar Ray Leonard down on some matted ring floor like Dickie did. Frankly, I spent most of my time as a youth being attracted too but ultimately trying to run, run very hard, away from the Dickie guys, the street-wise corner boys who fall sort of catching the brass ring. While they may be street-wise corner boys, unlike in this film, they are strictly bad-ass cut your throat for a dime characters best left behind. That was hard lesson to learn back in the day, and as the film makes clear, now too.    That said about the social realities of working class life what is there not to like about a film that highlights, Mickey Ward, one of our own getting out from under by sheer perseverance, wit, and his own sense of street smarts, mainly on his own terms. And to be a bloody stubborn Irishman to boot. Some of the stuff concerning his family connections, his eight million family connections, the \\"us against the world (you do not air your dirty linen in public, period)\\" while hard to take at points rang true. As did many of the confrontation scenes with Mickey's high-flying girlfriend Charlene, when she tried to break her man out of the family's grip. Finally, the acting from Wahlberg's conflicted (between family and career, between being a \\"stepping stone\\" and a champ) boxer, to Bale's mad monk ex-boxer who had gone a long way down from those Sugar Ray days (a not uncommon fate for those who are just not good enough to wear the crown, whatever the crown might be) to Leo's (Alice)one-dimensional family worldview (with nine kids, seven of them girls, that might have been the beginning of wisdom in her case) was uniformly fine. Still, I am glad, glad as hell that I made a left turn away from those corner boys down in the streets making all that noise. But it was a close thing, no question.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|Worth a dollar, sure.  But I dont think the app is astounding.  It makes some pics look pretty artsy and cool...some look meh...then again im not much a photographer so what do I know
B0020M99LC|3.0|I admit I was smitten by Ian Fleming's James Bond epic Cold War spy notion back when we used to see such adventure film fare on the big screen at the local drive-in theater (for those who do know of that 1950s and early 1960s institution check Wikipedia) when we were more interested in some \\"hot\\" date more than in the movie. I think the first one in the Bond series was Doctor No with Sean Connery in the Bond role. There have been some twenty-odd Bond films since (and many copy-cat films) and a succession of Bond replacements. Frankly, despite the good performance here by Daniel Craig as Bond (and as almost always by Judi Dench in anything she does) this Bond notion I think has gotten stale. The virtue of Connery's Bond was that while he was a wily and steadfast advocate of the \\"free world\\" he brought something of a slapstick air about the whole thing. This one, premised on fighting the \\"war on terrorism\\" by foiling a poker-loving \\"banker,\\" made me long for a cheeky Cold War spy night performance by Connery done with far less physical and technical whiz-bang action and more guile.
0553801473|3.0|The first 3 books in this series were great.  But sadly the last two are just verbose meanderings.  Martin can tell a good story, but he just can't end it well.  It appears the only way he can tie off a thread is to kill off the character.<br /><br />Personally, all the characters I liked and was interested in are dead (well, most of them.  Maybe 2 or 3 left alive, I just don't remember.  And I don't really care about the new characters that have been introduced.  And what is really telling about this book is, after having finished it, the only characters I can recall are the ones left alive from the first book.<br /><br />The last two books do nothing to move the story forward, they just make it longer.  The characters we have invested in and are wondering their fate are mostly missing.  Martin just creates rabbit trails that do nothing to either further the story or keep your interest.  They just wander through the brush.<br /><br />What began as brilliant has become tarnished and tedious.  I'm very sad.  I think this will be my last \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" book.<br /><br />My suspicion is that the motivation for writing 7 books is to create a TV series that could last 7 seasons.  But when you keep killing off characters people lose interest in where the story is going.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|There is not one song on this album I don't like! The cd was whiles fast and was not damaged witch is something I worries about some times.
0553801473|3.0|Dany's favourite qoute and she doesn't fail to deliver, in that regard at least. Sadly Martin does. I must concede being a huge fan of the series and after waiting for round about six years my expectations may have been a little out of proportion. But honestly, who could expect anything less than greatness of the man who delivered \\"A Game of Thrones\\", \\"A Clash of Kings\\" and \\"A Storm of Swords\\"? But the only truly great thing about this book is the prodigious page-count. And so I must find that, should I look back, I may be lost, too. Remembering the first three exquisite books of the series makes me cry out in frustration. To be sure, I shall read the two forthcoming novels but I wonder if I shall enjoy them. And quite frankly, the last two books can only be described as \\"from bad to worse\\". \\"A Feast for Crows\\" was boring and I struggled trough the entire read. \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" felt more like a dance with a cripple.<br />Tyrion moves a great distance but his story doesn't move. He doesn't develop. With Dany it's worse: she regresses. She falls into old rhythms trying to save every one. Where did we lose that strong independent girl with her dragons? And Jon... well Jon. I don't even know what to say of him. He becomes tiresome. He was introduced as a young man with a reinforced-concrete spine who would neither bend nor break when his mind was set. He would do his duty and above all else the right thing, no matter what. Sure, he was immature in certain aspects and he blundered from time to time. But he knew when to listen to reason and heeded counsel. Sadly instead of growing up he regressed more and more into the roll of petulant teenager who feels that the whole world has conspired against him and so I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't survive the first few chapters of the next book. And what happened to Bran and Arya? We get a few lousy chapters I can count on one hand not using my thumb and pinky.<br />As compensation we get very good Reek chapters. Honestly I hated Theon for everything he did since Robb had sent him to his father. But still his chapters were highly enjoyable so I know for sure Martin hasn't lost his edge. Which makes me wonder why everything else in \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" reeks of mediocrity.<br />Certainly, I concur with another reviewer here: a mediocre Martin is better than most everything on the market. It's a sad fact but it seems I shall spend the next five or six years the same way I spent the last six: checking Martin's Not a Blog twice a day for updates and hoping that Martin will once again pick up his sceptre and crown, take place upon his rightful throne at the very summit of fantasy literature and show his fans, his critics, his admirers and those who know nothing just who exactly is the undisputed master of fantasy.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I can't count the times I've seen this movie. This DVD set was exceptional. The special features were great showing how the movie was made. Being a F1 fan it added to my film library. They'll never make another like it.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|Director Joe Wright does a 180 from his acclaimed \\"Atonement\\" and delivers an action thriller that doesn't conquer new territory as much as it brings some grit to the genre.  \\"Hanna\\", stars Saoirse Ronan who got an Oscar nom from her role in the aforementioned \\"Atonement\\".  Here, she's a 16 year old girl far removed from civilization (some remote Scandinavian country) living with her ex-spy dad Erik (Eric Bana).  They are evidently evading the CIA and/or other evil goon squads.  There's a secret about the girl that we suspect but don't see until later.  Once Dad is convinced she can survive on her own, she is turned loose to head back to the world.  Dad goes the other way with a plan to reunite in Berlin.  Ronan is remarkable as a world class martial artist, showing real prowess.  At times she also is a regular if naïve, teenager.  Brilliant acting including Cate Blanchette as the CIA officer in charge and the quirky Jessica Barden from \\"Tamara Drewe\\" and a rocking Chemical Brothers soundtrack help elevate this movie from the norm.<br /><br />BLU RAY UPDATE:<br />This is a Blu ray update and second viewing.  It might seem unusual for director Joe Wright who is known more for the likes of \\"The Soloist,\\" \\"Atonement, \\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" to take on an action flick like this.  It is a pretty straight forward escape and exact revenge film.  Nothing unusual about that.  Nothing really unusual about the fact that it is a female seeking retribution.  Nothing really unusual even that it is a teen-ager.<br /><br />So what makes this film so interesting?  First and foremost, Wright spends enough time with Hanna early in the film to make you believe she could be a lethal weapon.  After all, she's 16 and about 100 pounds.  Raised by her father (Eric Bana), a former CIA operative, in remote northern Finland, Hanna is trained to survive and kill those who would harm her.  In a brilliant about face, Oscar nominee (for the aforementioned \\"Atonement,\\") Saoirse Ronan is totally convincing in spite of her sprite-like presence.  While the action sequences are truly excellent, Wright takes the time to humanize Hanna.  She's whip-smart and quick to adapt, but she is also sheltered from the world.  She's never kissed a boy for example.  And when that opportunity arises she is both curious and fearful.<br /><br />In her cross-continent escape to Berlin she encounters a band of gypsies in southern Spain.  Rather than brushing past this meeting, Wright lingers a bit, allowing Hanna to absorb her first real exposure to music.  There are many subtleties that raise this action drama above the norm.  When Hanna meets another teenage girl (terrific Jessica Barden) they become friends.  You can see it in their eyes as the camera closes in on their dilated pupils.  The villain in the movie it another surprise.  Cate Blanchett is the sinister CIA sector boss who authorized the experiments that led to Hanna's unusual abilities and killed her mother.  In one scene when Marissa (Blanchett) is under stress, the camera catches her upper lip quivering.<br /><br />Lest one think this film is short on action, think again.  In a noteworthy scene shortly after Hanna is captured early in the movie, she escapes killing those in her way and using her lithe frame and training to slink through tunnels, ductwork, cracks and crevices.  All this while the Chemical Brother's pounding soundtrack fills the speakers.  This is grade A escapism.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer of this film is near perfect.  Filled with snowy landscapes and glowing computer banks, the film sparkles from every corner.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is of reference quality.  The speakers are constantly active is the surrounds and the LFE channel is full of lossless bass.  The sound is enveloping without become aural trickery.  Bonus features include an alternate ending, deleted scenes, an anatomy of a scene and commentary by director Joe Wright, a piece on the Chemical Bros. score and soundtrack and several other featurettes.d several other featurettes.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Rise of the Planet of the Apes  I've never been a Trekkie, or a hardcore Star Wars fan, although I enjoy both. I'm neither into the Harry Potter series, nor the Lord of the Rings ... although I do enjoy watching the series with my two boys. What I am and always have been, is a true to the bone Planet of the Apes fan. I love all five original films...even the weaker ones. If I were to choose my favorite, it would be the 1968 original film starring Charlton Heston. Heston plays Taylor, a bitter misanthropic, an explorer in space in search of \\"something better than man.\\" When Taylor and crew bounce through a time warp and crash land on what seems like a desolate planet, they soon discover that apes are the supreme race, while mute humans are the savages. Befriended by two chimps, Cornelius and Dr. Zira, the three makes their way to the Forbidden Zone where Taylor discovers the half-buried remains of the Statue of Liberty. Taylor realizes that he has been on earth all along, 2000 years in the future. For it's time a very shocking ending and even today it still plays well. If it all sounds like an extended Twilight Zone episode, well then I guess it was because the original screenplay was penned by Rod Serling. Beneath the Planet of the Apes, second film, premiered in 1970 and I couldn't race to the theatre fast enough to see this. In this chapter, Astronaut Brent, played by James Franciscus, is in hot pursuit of the lost spacecraft, Icarus, manned by Colonel Taylor. Following Taylor's flight path, Brent soon finds himself on the Planet of Apes. Much of the first half of the film plays out like the original with Brent making much of the same discoveries. The later half of the film takes a drastic turn as Brent discovers the remaining survivors of the human race living in a sub city beneath the earth. It is here where the apes military force, lead by General Ursus, are headed. It is also here where Brent finds an imprisoned Taylor. As the apes gain entry into the underground city, an ensuing battle breaks out. As war wages, Brent and Taylor make their way to the cities main cathedral where an atomic bomb stands. After Brent is killed and Taylor critically wounded by General Ursus, played by James Gregory in a rousing performance, Taylor engages the bomb and the screen fades to white. When Heston blew up the world putting an end to \\"this upside down civilization\\", there I sat, in my seat, mouth agape, popcorn kernels spread across my lap. I was hooked like I've never been hooked on anything in my young life before. My little friend, Jimmy Smith, and me made it our young life's mission to see both films as many times as we could. It wasn't an easy task either, because there weren't any VCR or DVD players in those days. We racked up 20 viewings of the Heston original and 17 viewings of its popular sequel just by going to the movie theatre. 20th Century Fox made it easier on a kid trying to stretch his movie buck by re-releasing them TOGETHER, billed as \\"Back by Popular Demand!\\" We were in ape heaven. Then something happened, something unforeseen to this 11-year-olds young mind. A third movie premiered in 1971, Escape from the Planet of the Apes. What? More apes? How could this be? The world was destroyed, blew up at the hands of Colonel Taylor by mans man-made atomic bomb. It was all too much for this kids mind to comprehend. All I could do was slap down my movie buck and see for myself. Writer, Paul Dehn, who wrote the one sequel and the following three prequels, was given the job by 20th Century Fox to come up with a believable story line to keep the series alive. Keeping in mind with his already destruction of the world, his task was to take the apes back in time. To the present, to the period before the revolution of the apes. Thus, Dr. Zira and her husband, Cornelius are joined by ape scientist Dr. Milo who has salvaged Colonel Taylor's' spaceship and launches it into orbit just before the destruction of the earth. The apes bouncethrough the same time warp, which brought Astronauts Taylor and crew to the future, only to return the apes back to the past. In this chapter Dehn writes for laughs only to deliver a tragic blow at the end of the film. An ending I found hard to shake as a kid. The following year 20th Century Fox brought us Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. Child Chimp of Dr. Zira and Cornelius, Cesar, has grown into adulthood and it is in this chapter that Cesar leads the apes to revolt and take control of Los Angeles. This is the story line that \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" follows. \\"The final Chapter\\" as billed is Battle for the Planet of the Apes released 1973. In this fifth and final installment. Cesar and apes control all of mankind. While Battle is the weakest of the series, it does offer another fine performance by Roddy McDowell, not the tour de force he delivers in Conquest, but still a commanding performance. Twenty three years later Tim Burton would release his \\"re-imagining\\" of Planet of the Apes. While by far the biggest disappointment of all the ape films, the movie does have a stand out performance by Tim Roth and General Thade and a wonderful cameo by Charlton Heston as Zauis, Thades father. This brings me to the 2011 release \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\\" I, myself, am old school when it comes to Prosthetics vs. CGI. A big part of my love for the films is the make up. Ground breaking it was for 1968. When I learned that the new release would offer only CGI monkeys I was quickly skeptical and very disappointed, that is until I heard that Andy Sirkis would play the role of Cesar and then I caught a glimpse of the trailer some months back. Wow, this looks damn good, I thought. Looks like a remake of Conquest. Interesting, Conquest is one of my favorites of the series. Good God, I gotta wait until August! The excitement mounted. I quickly exchanged a couple facebook messages with my ole ape-pal, Jim Smith. He was looking forward to the release to, but like myself, harbored some doubt. His exact words were something like: I am suspended somewhere between excited anticipation and a dreaded expectation of almost certain disappointment. On August 4th 2011, some 43 years after I sat next to pal Jimmy, in an old dingy theatre, The Broadway, on fourth street in Santa Ana. The lights dimmed, the curtain rose. My son Jake, to my left, my other boy, Vince was to my right. I took in a deep breath...and off I went. Being a fifty year old man, I couldn't help but feel a little bit like a kid again. I couldn't believe I was about to watch another Planet of the Apes film! Not to reveal too many spoilers on the film, I will say that no expense was spared. Time and care was taken to put out a great film. Something 20th Century Fox stopped doing after the 1968 original. Every movie that followed (Beneath, Escape, Conquest, Battle) experienced budget cuts from pre-production on through post-production. The work of actor Andy Sirkis and the CGI effects crew work well in bringing Cesar to life. You can see the emotion in Cesar's eyes. You can feel his pain and confusion, you can sense his fear at the hands of the gate keepers at the Ape Sanctuary where Cesar inevitably ends up. You can understand his mounting hatred and distrust of mankind. When Cesar makes the decision to rise up and lead the apes on to revolt and break free of their prison we as audience members trust and believe in him. We root for him. The battle on the Golden Gate Bridge is spectacular. I found myself getting caught up, becoming emotional as the apes outfox the police. As low clouds settle on the bridge, obstructing the apes view of an almost certain ambush, Cesar sends out his army up above the cables of the bridge and below the bridge structure, as apes advance and hold their position Cesar and the remaining apes advance forward at full speed. It is an awesome, thrilling, spectacular battle. One soon never forgotten. As the final credits roll, I was thankful that thisnew film will surely rejuvenate an old beloved movie franchise from the past. Rise of the Planet of the Apes pays a lot of homage to the original. If you make a comparison of the Rise cast list with the original cast list you will see many names of original characters and actors/producers are used in this latest version. Even the addition of Charlton Heston's face playing on a TV screen paints the background of a scene as well as the blast off of the spacecraft Icarus is caught on it's launch and latter in the film to be learned that the space probe has lost contact with earth. Setting up a sure remake of the original film. My fingers are crossed as I wait in excited anticipation!    On the Victor scale of 1 through 5, 5 being best I rate the follow ape movies like so:    Planet of the Apes - 5  Beneath the Planet of the Apes - 4  Escape from the Planet of the Apes - 3  Conquest of the Planet of the Apes - 4  Battle for the Planet of the Apes - 2  Planet of the Apes 2001 - 2  Rise of the Planet of the Apes - 5
B004LWZW2E|4.0|\\"Insidious\\" raises the bar on the good old fashion ghost story.  To begin with we have an excellent cast headed by Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne, the parents of 2 young sons.  Josh (Wilson) is a teacher and Renai (Byrne) a struggling songwriter and full time homemaker.  They move into a new house which, as expected, is apparently haunted.  Here we get some very creepy scenes of haunting ghosts and demons. The twist is that they move again and viola, the ghosting is back!  I'm no fan of torture-porn films so have so far resisted the \\"Saw\\" franchise, but their filmmakers are responsible for this goreless horror film.  Technically, it is very effective.  The ending is a bit much and tends to coral the film into a traditional finish.  Still, I liked it very much.
030745455X|5.0|There are a plethora of really good fiction authors but Stieg Larsson has that certain something that elevates him to that small elite group of exceptional writers who spellbind you & hypnotise you with their stories. In my opinion he's joined the ranks of Dahl, Sheldon, Rowling, James A Michener & Dan Brown. It's a shame that he passed with such a small output of work.<br />This book is captivating, although the pacing slows slightly in the middle. His characters, particularly Lisbeth & Mikael are wonderful. If you enjoyed the first book, you'll love this.
B004LWZVZM|4.0|Robert Redford directs this factually correct historical drama.  My guess is that he realized the film could be a bit stiff and boring but decided to deliver it this way.  That is, it plays like something you might see on The History Channel or PBS. That's not necessarily a criticism but it takes a while to get used to the hazy prism, the sepia tones and the glaring beams of sunlight.  The cast is superb with James McAvoy in the lead as attorney Frederick Aiken who is appointed to defend alleged conspirator Mary Surratt, played by the wonderful Robin Wright (Penn??) While I'm only vaguely familiar with the events following Lincoln's assassination in 1865, I do remember Ms. Surratt's hanging being historically relevant for many reasons.  First and foremost, she was a woman.  Redford often brings reference to modern times with the script and I'm certain that's no coincidence.  Comparisons to the current debate of military trials of civilians are easy to identify.  While the film's pacing is deliberate, I found the experience compelling and entertaining.
0345529057|5.0|I'm only a third of the way through Game of Thrones, but I can already say that George R R Martin not only has a great story to tell, but he tells it brilliantly.  His complicated plots and delightfully fleshed-out characters, and their dialogue, make it a joy to read.    I really am glad that I didn't discover this wonderful story until recently, after the HBO series showed.  I feel bad for the people who started this journey back in 1995 and have had to wait so long for each book to be published.  That's why I gave up on Stephen King and his Dark Tower series - I just got too frustrated waiting for the next book.  At least with ASOIAF, I know I'll only have to wait for the final two books.    My only minor complaint would be the small text size.  Of course, I realize that if it were any larger, the books would be 2,000 pages each.  But for us older readers, if you're looking for something extra to buy to qualify for free shipping, you might want to consider buying some stronger reading glasses.  Seriously.  I can read this text quite easily with my +1.25 glasses, but to read the books, I need +1.75.    I see from other reviews to expect a slowing of the story in books 3 and 4, but for now, I'm enjoying the ride.  It's a hard book to put down.
B005IFWXWU|5.0|$7.99 - do yourself a favor! You deserve it. I know you've been working hard and could use a bit of indulgence. After all, it's just a little, right? I thought you might :) Enjoy...
1849386684|5.0|This book is great for beginners. It's very easy to follow and understand. Justin is the best teacher for those who want to learn to play guitar. I recommend checking out his website and lessons on Youtube. I thought playing guitar was impossible and after ordering this book and following Justin's videos, I can play a handful of songs after picking up a guitar two months ago.
B0050PYNO4|2.0|Brief disclaimer about myself...yes, I have my own strongly held Christian based religious beliefs but I believe everybody is entitled to their own views and opinions. I can take a joke, as long as it's good. I am also a huge Simon Pegg fan...I consider \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" to be one of the greatest films ever made and to be a truly inspiring film. Being a big Simon Pegg fan, I ignored the negative reviews for Paul, especially the ones accusing it of \\"religion bashing\\".  I figured it was just some fundementalist Christians, who are even more uptight than me. Unfortunately, that is exactly what the film was, and the worst \\"sin\\" of all is that it is not even remotely funny or clever. A massive collection of talent couldn't save the film from becoming a few actors' diatribes against any and all religious beliefs (not just Christian). The few funny gags have been seen countless times on commercials, the plot was not well developed, nor was the leading villian, leaving it a thinly veiled rant against religion with some Comicon nerd humor thrown in. Being a Simon Pegg/Nick Frost pet project, it basically serves to advocate their atheist views and ridicule anybody with religious beliefs of any kind; imploring people to drink, have sex, and do drugs whenever one can (to each their own). Even though its sole purpose is to insult mine and everybody else's religious views, I could forgive all this as long as it was intellegent and funny...but it's not. It's basically \\"Battlefield Earth\\" for atheists. The humor is lowbrow, which I am usually fine with, as long as it's witty, but it's stuff I would have thought up as a 14 year old. If you're sensitive of your religious views being insulted, this is not for you. If your an atheist looking for an intellegent film to advance your views, this is also not for you. Even if you're just looking for an entertaining film, this again is unfortunately not for you. It was a colossal waste of talent and a major bomb. Sincerely hope Pegg and Frost redeem themselves with their next film because this one sucked.
B004SBX112|2.0|very disappointed to learn that the newest release has to have a data connection to work, especially an ad-free version. with unlimited data gone people now have watch how much they use, absurd that a non-online game will incur data charges
B000PFU6RW|5.0|Safe and the International shipping don't harm the case of CD . One of the top power melodic metal Finland band of the century and my favorite band.<br />Thanks amazon and quality in the service.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|We want the original theatrical releases !!!!. Damn you George Lucas, DAMN YOU!!!! Why must you ruin everything you touch.
B0002IQAN6|5.0|THE best live classic rock album, ever! This new SACD remastering of the original Lp release, is just great! Far superior to the 90's release of the same recordings as \\"The Filmore Concerts\\", and WAY better than the mixes available on the \\"Dreams\\" box set.    I am a HUGE Duane Allman fan, and have studied his recordings for years. This SACD takes these live performances to a whole new sonic level. The clarity is amazing, and the live feel and sound of the Filmore hall is right there. You can hear the tiny nuances of Duane's finger picking, and BO's bass is incredibly powerful in a way it has never been represented before. Match this one up with \\"Eat a Peach\\" and get ready to be blown away by the Brotha's in their prime.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This was a superb movie.  It certainly deserved the Academy Awards it received.  As the grandfather of an autistic child, I can vouch for the accuracy of this film.  The acting was so accurate it was hard to discern any difference between the actress and the real individual portrayed.
B00007E8SW|5.0|This is definitely an album for jazz fans. Dont try to introduce a newbie with this one. But for us die hard jazz lovers, this is where its at. Not as poppy and easily digestable as Blue Train, but they go deeper into the music here. Coltrane is killin' it, throughout. The SACD sound quality is also very good, and well balanced! Nice seperation and detail from the master tapes. Not overly bright, as the recent \\"Blue Train\\" remaster seems to be. Two thumbs up!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very impressive app for free! It has all the books avail abd very easy to access and does so quickly. It has great features for bookmarking and highlighting verses. It has voice audio integrated for an awesome option of listening to someone read it to you. the voice that reads is actually pleasant to listen to and not robotic. You can also share and post verses to social websites if desired. Overall fantastic!
B00008CLOA|5.0|I purchased this version because \\"Dark Side\\" because it was the only Pink Floyd album available on SACD at the time. First off, Dark Side was my least favorite of their 60's-70's works, (which are the best ones), and I wasnt expecting much more than a little improved sound quality. What I got was a whole new experience with one of Rock's greatest albums. It was literally like hearing it for the first time all over again. GREAT remix! Great detail and seperation of instruments. Sonically, as good as I've heard rock music on digital media be.
B004VMUS9G|2.0|Nothing to write home about. I ended up using the default alarm on my phone because it was easier to use and works just as well. I was hoping this would be just as easy and have more options.
B0002IQAMW|5.0|Superb version of this essential southern rock masterpiece. This SACD version is just plain inspirational. I had a large Brothers collection before updating to SACD recently, and listening to this disc was the first time I was able to hear the crickets on \\"Little Martha\\", and I have listened to the Brothers all my life! If you're a rock guitarist, this is a must have disc. \\"Mountain Jam\\" is great with Barry Oakley leading the charge with his P-bass, and \\"One Way Out\\" is an excellent example of Duane's Blues prowess with a corcidian bottle, an SG, and a 50w Marshall. The mix/mastering of this, (and \\"At Filmore East\\"), set a new sonic standard for Allman Brothers fans, and rock in general. If you have an SACD player, you MUST update your catalouge with these two new remasters! End of story.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Its Kindle. Not much to say it doesnt crash and seems to work ok so far. I would recommend this, the app for PC and even the handheld device... it seems like one of the better tech devices made in the last while. Recommended.
B0038ZITIE|3.0|I grew up watching this movie. After thirty years (am I really THAT old?!), it is still a blast to watch. There's no way I would rate this movie less than five stars. Ever.<br /><br />When they say \\"Savior of the Universe\\" edition, I expected spectacle, fanfare and a whole hell of a lot more than a sketch by Alex Ross (A great and gifted artist, but that's not the matter). This really inferior release has two interviews and only one of them is someone who worked on the film itself. Ross gets his own featurette where he does nothing but gloat over his 'involvement' with the film which begins and ends with the DVD case cover art and a small insert.<br /><br />Please understand, I LOVE this movie. DO NOT buy this version unless you're just that much a fan. I'm not sure if the BD boasts better bits, but this one... aough! Film- five stars. The SotU edition of the DVD - no stars.<br /><br />Whole picture: three, just because there's nothing special about this special edition.<br /><br />But Queen still rocks!
0141192410|3.0|Little Women is one of my favorite pieces of classic literature. When I realized I didn't own a copy, I decided to invest in one. So I purchased this edition.<br /><br />I tried reading it, and the font didn't agree with me too much. Furthermore, the binding challenges ones ability to keep the book open in a manner proper for reading.<br /><br />After a few tries, I gave up and decided it was better to just let it sit and look pretty on my shelf.<br /><br />I should have gotten the softcover version.
0307272702|4.0|Gary Taubes advocates a new approach to weight- control and reduction. He says we should not be basing our efforts to attain and maintain a reasonable weight on the 'calories in calories out' approach. He says we have been receiving for years the wrong advice in regard to proper eating. The recommendation to cut fat in the diet to prevent heart- related disease he maintains has been mistaken. However as I understand it this is not quite correct as there has been a reduction in heart- disease rates over the past forty years due most likely to reduced consumption of high animal fats. In any case he argues that the real culprit in the obesity- epidemic is excessive consumption of carbohydrates especially those which come from fructose rich foods. The carbohydrates lead to insulin spurts which augment fat- storage. His recommendation is then to move away from the poor people's diet which is over- rich in carbohydrates.<br />My own experience in this tells me he is correct in pointing to the phenomenom of excessive carbohydrate eating leading to still greater hunger and more carbohydrate eating. But I am not certain that the recommendation to increase the amount of fat in the diet is a correct one.
B005CMSDKA|1.0|A well photographed, well acted, quirky, esoteric film that goes no where, with characters that meant nothing to me. Cate Blanchet was obviously contractually obligated to be in the nonsense. All the cool music, great sets, fantastic locations, and odd audio in the world will not supply a story for a film that has none. Sorry. This film was a zero and it implied zero all throughout. Episodes of Adventure Time with Finn and Jake have more to tell and say than this canned ham of a film did.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Huge star wars fan here and I will not be purchasing this watered down, cgi infested abomination. These are no longer the movies I grew up loving. I would rather watch my old unremastered versions on dvd then this special edition garbage on blue-ray.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I Tried I really did! but..    I couldn't get past all the changes when it was all said, and done. I went over, and, over them in my head I just couldn't do it. I was fine with all the changes up until now because i considered them enhancements,  but this time it's messing with history.    Vader saying Noooooo... erked me.  My brain tried to justify him speaking, but in  the end it said NOOOOO!!! (in my opinion) it seriously takes away from the scene that we all know. Vader hadn't spoken in over 25 years why have him speak now? Actions speak louder than words. Obi-Wan's yell  does not need to be there at all.     In fact all the changes (save for enhancing Yoda, or blinking Ewoks) don't need to be there. However, understand that these are his movies, and he will do what he likes with them, dispite what we think.    To those buying Enjoy! (if you can.)
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|Very bad application. I do not recommend this one. All I get is weird images and lines. I will uninstall if not fixed.
1402756399|5.0|A very careful and rich edition of Darwin's classic, the book is aimed at a lay but passionate and cultivated audience. Drawings, letters and other curiosities provide an interesting reading.
B004HAG40O|1.0|I thought maybe I had somehow mixed up the CD's and put in one of my mom's country ones. I guess they are a country band now. Really genuinely disliked most of the songs. Me and my wife were very excited to hear the new album, couldn't have been more disappointed. Couldn't have been more disappointed about being so disappointed considering how excited we were. If your into country you might like this, if your into The Decemberists you may very well not.
1582701709|5.0|Fascinating Book!!! Never know what one can learn by applying positive thinking into the psyche! I encourage all to give it a try!! Would recommend highly for all to read. Definitely something to be learned here!! Thanks Amazon!! Truly ladyx!!
B000BB1MI2|5.0|What can I say. My 5 yr old loves this movie. It is absolutely crazy and weird but it is a classic at our house.
0792165020|5.0|Loved this Movie, Matt and Jude were great [and not bad to look at!!!!] I would definately recommend this Movie!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I've read countless books that include a world with an all-immersive virtual reality game. Most of the time, it falls flat or unbelievable that people would use it as described. Cline is the first one I've read that feels the most believable and realistic. I blazed through this book--not just for the pop culture references or geek culture characters--but for the great writing and engaging story.
0802473156|5.0|It's truly a must read for every relationship. I mean, it's practically that guide that all men wish women came with and all women wish men came with. Instead of wishing you could know how they're feeling, what they're thinking, and what you can do to make him/her see how much you love him/her, you CAN. Understanding how your partner feels loved and having them understand how you feel loved makes all the difference in the world.<br /><br />It's hard to explain but easy to understand once you start reading. The ah-ha moments will blow you away.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I enjoyed Paul... funny and well done. A bit risque and not for kids. Paul is a bit on the foul mouth side and there are plenty of sexual innuendos to go around.
B00130VLZ4|5.0|Good light weight camera case. Easy to use and protects the camera.  Built in snap holds it to the camera strap.
0316069353|4.0|I thought this was a very good book that kept me intrigued throughout with clever twists and turns. There's even a glimmer of hope that Haller might finally grasp the happiness that has so often eluded him.
B00003CXBK|5.0|My personal favorite of all the Miyazaki films.  Great story -- Neil Gaiman did a most excellent job of writing the English version! -- wonderful visuals and great soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|Cool looking app, unfortunately it also caused my stock camera to go haywire. It is cool though. HTC Evo 4G
B00005JLEU|5.0|The bathhouse visuals are quite stunning! Love the dustballs (watch Totoro for more dustball action)!  Again, great soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi!
0375851569|5.0|I purchased this set of books for my great-grandaughter.  She loves to have them read to her and the more tongue twisted they are the better.  Dr. Seuss has been a great series that I shared with my children when they were little.  I would recommend this set as a good way to introduce Dr. Seuss to a child.
B00008EY9G|4.0|***CONTAINS SPOILERS***    This film at times made me feel like I was watching a low budget movie with actors that have been in a lot of other movies but aren't famous enough to be in a real blockbuster (except John Cusack and Amanda Peet). It was a good thriller though because it kept you guessing till the very end, and even then you have to ask yourself questions about the plot.     I noticed that a few things didn't add up, but then again none of this *really* happened, so it doesn't have to be completely plausible either. The \\"killer\\" at the end of the movie was a little unrealistic in real life.    Obviously, don't expect the psychological information to be accurate, it's just a movie. Overall worth watching if you enjoy thrillers.
0380973642|5.0|This contains my favorite short story, 'The Prince'.  I first read it about 6 years ago and whenever I see a black cat I think of this story.  I also love the whimsical 'Chivalry'.
B003SNJYSK|4.0|I enjoyed reading \\"The redbreast\\" because it is a well-written, intelligent and unusual story.<br /><br />The author uses the multiple point of view method in the book and due to this the readers can get a glimpse into the minds of the protagonists as well as the antagonists; this creates a reading experience which is not only interesting because we get to know what happens next an who is behind all the crimes committed, but because we get very deep and thorough descriptions of the thoughts and motivations of the characters.<br /><br />I give 4 stars to the book because it is not flawless, and, interestingly, the biggest problem with the book lies with its main character. Harry Hole's character is simply a big collection of clich&eacute;s; the character of an alcoholic, lonely, poor, but generous and just policeman is overused, in my opinion.<br /><br />All in all, the book is worth reading, the story is engaging, the point of view characters are very well done, except for our hero, Harry Hole, who is simply too familiar to be interesting.
B0053Q9DHW|1.0|If you were as disappointed in this production's failure to portray \\"l'amour fou\\" (the crazy love) between Jane and Rochester as I was, try the production William Hurt stars in,[[ASIN:B00007K02F Jane Eyre]]. I was so looking forward to a new production of this classic but besides all Cary Fukumaga's forward flashes to the side flashes to the back flashes(found myself wondering if viewers that had never read the so well written book, would be able to keep up with all those chronolgical time jumps)there was simply no, zilch, nada, zero, nil chemistry between Mia Wasikowsk and Michael Fassbender. Huge downer! This film is so badly done and unlikely to capture the imagination of new fans that it will be another decade or two before anyone attempts to produce \\"Jane Eyre\\" again. Lovely scenery, but lovely scenery does not a love story make.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Once a year some fabulous movie comes along,that you have to see.  Well this is it FOLKS, \\"PAUL\\" is a must own DVD. The theater release   is great,but the unrated version is side splitting.REGULAR for kids  and UNRATED for adults. GET IT NOW!!!   Another great movie that goes along with this is Planet 51. Children  and Adults will get a kick out of it.  THANKS
0553801473|1.0|I've had enough. After seeing the HBO version on television, I read the first four books of this series . I was hoping for some sort of conclusion to the many cliffhangers, what I got was an insult to my ability to read. Writers shouldn't forsake and abuse their audience with such blatant and callus disregard. Storytelling is an art with which this writer is completely unfamiliar; it borders on negligence. I'll not pay for another volume. I'll not watch another episode. This author talks endlessly about rape, his preoccupation with the subject is apparent in the way he mistreats his readers - I've been raped and I'll be damned if I'll willingly submit to it again.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|I had forgotten about this movie,and the price was right.  Now while viewing this I found a 4th video, so that is in   the works.Yes, they do have a dual disc set of all four   movies. So if your a Wesley Snipes/BLADE fan your set.  THANKS

1416972242|3.0|City of Ashes in the second book in Cassandra Clare's The Mortal Instruments series. Clare welcomes you back to her world of vampires, werwolves and down-worlders with open arms and a brand new story. But in saying that, City of Ashes certainly reads as unnecessary exposition, ahem, I mean, book two in a planned trilogy.<br /><br />In this story, Jace and Clary are back to their old antics as they continue their struggle against the infamous crusader, Valentine. Joined by the old gang, Jace and Clary travel from place to place, argue, travel, argue... and that about sums up the story. I'm not saying that City of Ashes was a bad book. In fact, I loved it. I think the premise is intractably constructed and Clare writes with artistic brilliancy. However, the story is really driven (haha) by travel and arguing.<br /><br />There was also plenty of twists and turns as I have come to expect from Cassandra Clare. The characters are well-developed and believable - though I do question the authenticity of the Inquisitor's motives. The Jace/Clary relationship is slightly disturbing and I felt that it was a bit of a distraction from the overall flow of the story. Other than those small irritants, the story flowed pretty much flawlessly.<br /><br />In terms of originality, Clare nails it. She does borrow a few of the more overused mythological creatures in popular culture, but it doesn't affect the structure of the story. If you loved book one, then you'll probably love book two. I'll be reading book three, but not any time soon. City of Ashes left me feeling somewhat underwhelmed. That's just of my own opinion.<br /><br />Story: 6/10<br />Characters: 9/10<br />World: 8/10<br />Impression: 6/10<br />Overall: 7.5/10<br /><br />(Check out my blog attached to my profile for more fantasy reviews!)

044024238X|3.0|this is definitely a chick-lit for women of all ages. kind of predictable but still funny & witty. beware of alot of cursing though. would've given it 4-5 stars but was offended when a passage in the book gave an impression that Filipino housekeepers DON'T speak ENGLISH. ever heard of lillie piccio? she's PRINCE WILLIAM & HARRY'S FILIPINO NANNY who speaks fluent ENGLISH.
B001AQR3E4|5.0|5 stars out of 5 = Masterpiece<br /><br />Elegant, sophisticated, beautifully scripted, acted, paced, & filmed, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" is among my top five favorite Vampire movies. No other Vampire film, other than Gary Oldman's Oscar worthy performance in \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula,\\" delves as deep in a character study of Vampires & how it would be like to be a Vampire from their point of view.<br /><br />A broad 200 year perspective of the life of Brad Pitts Vampire character, \\"Louie,\\" the reluctant Vampire who finally succumbs to his fate of feeding on human blood, & in his quest for enlightenment of what he is, he finds out, if anything, he is a Vampire.<br /><br />The story of a surprisingly great performance of Tom Cruise's, \\"Lestat,\\" who sees \\"the dark gift\\" as everything he could ever want, except companionship, what he wants the most, & realizes the least. Cruise steals the show in his glee for sucking the blood out of the living, & his indignation for turning \\"Louie\\" in to a Vampire that still has respect for human life, in a barrage of cold blooded murders, & ranting at \\"Louie\\" with black comedic hilarity, yet shocking indifference to life, to the point of sadomasochism . Also, a very young Kristen Dunst's, \\"Claudia\\", who also steals the show & matches Lestat bite for bite in the quest for blood, & the sport it brings. A hugely great & complicated performance for such a young girl!<br /><br />\\"Interview with the Vampire\\" is a thinking man's horror film, one that reaches down deep, not just to bring you cheap scares & shallow predictable characters, but a rich tapestry of what it means to be a Vampire, & all the consequences that goes with it.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|I had heart that this allegedly was a not-good movie. Oh how wrong were those reviews.<br /><br />This is a sensational movie. That Matt Damon has yet to make a bad movie. Awesome, enjoyable, emotionally moving. Based on a story by Phillip K. dick--which is great. Just a great ride.

B003UESJJC|1.0|I love Apocalypse Now. and have purchase almost evry release of the film. While the video on the current release is truly wonderful, the audio is not.    The good side - The video on the BluRay 3 disc release is absolutely spectacular! Of course, the story (original version) is a classic.    The VERY VERY BAD side - The DTS audio is great until it drops. I purchased the set at Best Buy and viewed the original version. I quit after hearing 8 audio drops in 1 hour and 38 minutes of playing time. I replaced this copy with another (from Best Buy) and the audio drops were still present. I am hoping these discs are from a bad lot. I will try again by purchasing a copy from Amazon.    It is hard to believe that the producers would go to the trouble of reissuing this film with such spectacular video and such poor audio.    Buyer beware.

0756404738|5.0|I tried to give it 4.5, but it seems the options are 4 (like) or 5 (love). Kvothe gets to the business of naming names in this one, and the adventures are well paced.  However, it isn't perfect; it does drag in certain places.  For example, his encounter(s) with a particular fae creature moves from unequaled excitement to bordering on tedium.  Too much time spent saying and doing the same thing.  The book also checks in at about a thousand pages.  I get nervous when I see such things because of the stephen king effect: writers begin to exert more editing power over their work than the editors, and the end product is watered down.  Is that the case here? I felt it in the fae realm, but not elsewhere, and I won't spoil the book by going over specifics.  Additionally - and I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing - Kvothe bumps into a lot of characters that would seem to represent very important relationships, but they tend to be left off to the side of the book's immediate action.  What's curious is that Rothfuss isn't killing off these characters (as Martin does); they just show up occasionally then run back into their little rabbit holes under Mains - so to speak.  The issue is this: they can't all be 'that' important, can they?  Finally, there's a little bit of comic book inconsistency here: Kvothe nearly broke Bast's wrist and slayed a handful of the razor spider things in the first book, but he got his skull thumped by a couple of robbers in the second.  This all happened in the span of 2 days.  I don't think one could argue that he was weakened from his first encounter either, because he locked down Bast after the encounter with the spider creatures.  Overall, this is a great read.  I'd rather post criticism than praise, but do note the 5 (4.5!) stars. :-)

B004LWZW4C|4.0|After the horribleness of X3 and Wolverine, I'd given up on Fox producing any more great X-Men films. It was such a treat this summer to be proven wrong. I had zero expectations going in. All First Class had to be was mediocre to get a passing grade. Instead we got an interesting alternate history plot with well-written characters and acted even better. Fassbender was the stand-out, but really, just about everyone brought their A-game. Just an all around great film - highly recommended. And the character cameos from the other films were excellent.<br /><br />The only reasons that kept me from giving First Class five stars-<br />- January Jones as Emma Frost. Yes she's supposed to be cold, not wooden. Were it not for Mad Men's buzz, they probably would've gotten another actress.<br />- I wish they would have resisted the urge to paralyze Xavier at the end of the movie. It would have been a great tease going into another film with that threat still looming. Just a personal complaint, not really a movie killer.
B004MGMIA8|5.0|it's great to have all of Johann Strauss Jr works in a box set! now I expect naxos release a similar edition with the complete work of Johann Strauss Father and Josef Strauss to enjoy all this family's music. I don't know if Eduard's works have been recorded completely just as his father's and brother's but it'd be a great bonus to have his music in a box set, though he was really destructive to his family's legacy.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I was so disappointed with this book.  I was a huge Song of Ice and Fire fan, but after Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons I doubt if I will read another Martin book again.<br /><br />The content issues just get worse, and the story is boring.
0470876417|4.0|This book makes you want start design (or redesign) a business model right away.<br /><br />What can you expect?<br />- Many practical tools to design/assess/re-think existing and new business models.<br />- Many examples.<br />- A very visual/attractive layouting.<br /><br />The book starts with a model 'canvas', describing the 9 building blocks of any model. You can download a canvas template from internet.<br /><br />Then a range of possible model patterns is presented and each pattern is illustrated with a famous example: long tail (e.g. amazon, lulu), multi-sided (e.g. google, apple), Free (e.g. free newspapers), Freemium (e.g. Skype), Bait & Hook (e.g. Gillette), Open business (e.g. P&G, GSK).<br /><br />You get a set of tools to help you design a model: an empathy map to gain customer insight, visual thinking, storytelling, scenarios,..<br /><br />You learn to think about strategy, i.e. you learn to take into account context (market forces, key trends,..) and to evaluate your model (swot analysis, etc.)<br /><br />I work for a start-up company and I used the canvas to visually explain our business model to others. I think it works great.<br /><br />If you're interested, there is also an iPad app. Check it out on businessmodelgeneration(dot)com
B00008PX8P|5.0|The hours of live performances from various venues on this 2-DVD set alone makes this purchase one of the best that I've ever made. I love the camera editing; unlike some live performance DVDs out there, the footage doesn't leave you dizzy because someone thought it would be cool in the span of five seconds to cut to the drummer, then the bassist, then the lead vocalist and then zoom in tight on the guitarist. I haven't watched all the performances or the interviews yet, but I'm looking forward to getting through all the content!
B00356CO1E|5.0|I was immensely satisfied with this workout. I was in the army years ago, had not worked out this intensely for over 10 years. I hated workout videos as I never seemed to lose weight or get an intense workout. This video changed my perception of workout videos. I am a very impatient person and I hate to spend an hour doing a workout with little to no results. I cannot recall when i have had such an intense workout in only 30 minutes or less. Keep up the good work jillian.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I just wanted to thank George Lucas for finally ruining a series with his 'peaks and valleys' of changes that would've been better off left in book form.  I saved almost 100 bucks cancelling this order.  Thank you sir.
078322706X|1.0|As an extra who worked in this movie, I think I can give a review of this film from a different point of  view.  The basic problem was the script, which needed  so many rewrites, the final product was a mishmash.  The director demanded so many retakes (40 for Brad  Pitt to kiss Forlani) any chemistry between the actors was lacking. All the extras were invited for  the premier, which was so tedious, I almost walked out. The director went so over budget on this farce that I'm surprised he ever worked again.  Brad Pitt fans may swoon over his performance, but if there  was any saving grace to the film it was Tony Hopkins.  He is a true gentleman, yes... I had several chats with him, a fine accomplished actor,  who was smart enough to insist on only five retakes  in his contract. Don't waste your money on this film.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Like most classic King works, this starts out really well.  Although we only get the briefest glimpse of about half a dozen characters, they feel real and well developed.  The storytelling is fluid, with a good balance of characterization for depth, but enough action to keep it at a brisk pace.  I have to say I enjoyed 90% of it immensely.  However, like most classic King works, the ending really flops.  Strangely enough, I feel like I can tolerate a crappy ending in a 1000 book, because I feel like at least I got 900 pages of good, solid story and anticipation out of it.  In a short story context, I'm a lot less forgiving.  I feel like a short story, being a compact form, should be very nearly perfect as far as balancing the tone and action, and the beginning, middle and end.  The ending of this story really disappointed me, so I'm giving it a four star.  In truth, I think it's only a three star if I judge it as a story written by Stephen King, but that doesn't seem fair to the story, so I'm going to judge it as if Joe Blow indie writer had written this story and uploaded it to the Kindle market.
6304711905|5.0|This is one of the best westerns of all time. Kirt Russel did a great job as Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer was the best Doc Holliday. A must see movie.
0783233477|4.0|I remember watching this movie when I was younger, and recently got into it again. I love this movie. Anthony Hopkins and Claire Florani do an amazing job. If anyone was awkward at all it would be Brad's character as Death. It's not Brad himself, but more Death's character that is just very strange at times. The cinematography is gorgeous, as is the music, overall this movie can make you cry. A few low points, I didn't like How Bill(Anthony's character) had a favortism going on with his daughter susanne over his daughter Allison. Quince is a great character. The character Drew is a pain in the ass, but also very good. Over all, great movie.

1567184855|5.0|I havent read a book in years and I picked this up started reading and didn't put it down except to attend to basic human functions. Also bought a copy for a friend.<br />What I liked about this book was it did not promote or deny religious belief. It merely recanted what the authors patients revealed about the spirit world after death and pre-incarnation while under hypnosis.<br />Whether or not this is fact or farce is unknown to me but it was most certainly fascinating.
B0001I561E|5.0|I still love this film.  Disney always knows how to make a great film. I have to admit that if this film didn't have Robin Williams as the Genie it would not be as great. His comic style and flare combined with his quick wit makes this little film just jump off the screen!! I give it an A++!!
B0032W7CZO|4.0|I received my cd a few weeks ago and am very pleased with it. Not only did it have no visible pits or scratches, but it played flawlessly. My only complaint is that it did not come in a plastic case; but a paper/thin, cardboard one wrapped in plasic. Maybe it was a demo? Anyway, i feel very lucky that my cd arrived in such good condition. I listen to it all the time now! Get it, and i promise you won't be disappointed! :-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger games will leave you hungering for more. Written about a time about class struggle and high power that controls everything within the districts. Collins is meticulous in how she describes in detail of what each character is thinking -amost as if she knows exactly what's on her readers' mind. She has a way of connecting readers with each of her characters. Collins writes her story through using Katniss' reasoning. This book has a love story theme but also what echoes throughout the book is the inequality of Panem's society and you can't help but to wonder if Collins is trying to draw a connection between the society of Panem and our Modern society.
030788743X|4.0|Ernest Cline's debut novel Ready Player One is an unusual, unique and utterly addicting read.  Kind of like a computer game that you can't shut down until you...<br /><br />It's 2045 and the Earth is in pretty bad shape. Most of the fossil fuel is gone and food and land are in short supply. To escape, most citizens check into The Oasis - a virtual world created by James Halliday. In the Oasis you can do or find anything you would ever need or want. When Halliday dies, he leaves the world with his last bequest - a baffling puzzle known as an Easter Egg is hidden somewhere in the Oasis. (Think Second Life) Solve it and you'll have all the money and power you ever dreamed of.<br /><br />Young Wade Watts has spent most of his young life plugged in and joins the millions of Egg Hunters or 'gunters, as they come to be known, in the search. He spends years learning about Halliday's favourite games, televison shows and obsessions - most of them based in the 1980's.<br /><br />When the first clue is found after many years, the stakes couldn't be higher for Wade and his on line friends - for Innovative Online Industries, the world's largest internet provider, want to win the prize themselves - and take over the Oasis.<br /><br />Ready Player One is completely outside of my normal tastes, but I really, really enjoyed it. I was initially intrigued as it seemed to fit into my recent obsession for YA dystopian fiction. But I found myself really enjoying all the '80's references - Pac Man, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Commodore 64's, song lyrics and a whole lot more -for these are the clues used to solve the puzzle.<br /><br />There's lots of adventure with epic good versus evil battles throughout. But Cline has also thrown in some thoughtful explorations of friendship, coming of age and yes, romance. Lots of fun for a variety of readers.<br /><br />I can see Ready Player One easily being made into a movie.
076790592X|5.0|I once told a colleague I was planning to read this book. She was surprised I was concerned about the topic of death when I am only in my thirties. She thought the book was geared to people who are closer to death or at least in retirement age. Although I totally disagreed with her point of view, I still nodded and told her it would be an interesting read.<br /><br />I first listened to an audio version of the book and then decided to read the book from end to beginning. I figured I wanted to look at the disease's progression reversely and I was not disappointed. I thought if I read the sad part first, then I can enjoy the rest of it.<br /><br />Through his outlook on life and the wealth of wisdom he provides to Mitch and the rest of us, I am left both totally saddened and enlightened by the truth in his words.<br /><br />This is not for the elderly to read because they have already gone through the wealth of life experiences that have hopefully led to spiritual growth. I sense this is more for the middle-aged because they are so inexperienced and so far away from the concept of death after being immersed in chasing the 'wrong' values in life.<br /><br />Thank you Morrie for sharing your journey and I do believe you will be God's chosen angel.

B004YCKJSS|4.0|a title I have wanted for years (I have the laser disc) and it is a beautiful transfer but a no-extras dvd.
1461190460|2.0|I ordered this book as a keepsake, because it's my favorite book ever written.  Unfortunately, this is a \\"large-print\\" version. That should have been in the title of the ad, because I missed it if it was in there anywhere. Actually, this version doesn't even contain large print.  It's normal size text with lots of extra spacing between paragraphs.  All drawings are so enlarged, they are highly pixelated.  And there are numerous text errors throughout the copy.  Great book -- bad product.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This is a twin-stick shooter with a good sense of humor and controls that work surprisingly well.  If you're unfamiliar with the phrase \\"twin-stick shooter,\\" it just means you control the character's movement with one thumb and the aiming with the other.  This allows you to move and fire in any direction.    In this game, you play as Barry Steakfries and some evil genius has figured out time travel and has released zombies into different periods of time.  So naturally, you follow through the time portals to clean up the mess.  You'll start off each mission with some brief dialogue and then you'll have to survive waves of zombies being teleported into the level.    You start off with a basic gun that has unlimited ammo and 5 grenades.  Additional item pickups will be dropped during the missions that can aid you in your slaughter, such as: SMG, shotgun, flamethrower, and sentry gun.  They have limited ammo, but take out zombies more efficiently.    I found the dialogue and story presentation to be very funny and the controls are rock-solid.  I highly recommend this game to action fans!
0307276902|4.0|I have picked this book up several times in the bookstore only to put it back on the shelf.  I realize it is on \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" list and has rave reviews.  I just wasn't sure if I wanted to read about someone else's addiction.      I had my own addiction 20+ years ago and can relate to a lot of what James experiences.  Thank the gods I never got into crack.  This book made me laugh out loud, cry (several times) and the fury raged at times, relating to circumstances and characters in the book.  It is a well written story of a young mans journey through drug addiction and rehab.  Written almost like a journal as you follow him daily through his experiences.      In the end I am glad I had the opportunity to read this book and thank James for this sharing his life so candidly, it took great bravery to do so.
1609611543|5.0|Although the title is not appealing, the contents of this book are.<br />In this well-researched presentation, the author makes an excellent<br />case against the consumption of our current-day wheat products. He<br />explores the history of the grain from its origins to its present-day<br />state. What he reveals to the reader is the sad truth of how a wholesome<br />& healthy grain has been manipulated and structurally modified over the<br />years into a non-food. He offers an alternative eating style that outlines<br />sample meals and recipes. Wheat products are a staple in the diet of most<br />Americans, and for that reason alone, this book is a must-read. By the way,<br />this is not a \\"diet\\" book, but I believe that if the author's advice were<br />followed, most people would lose weight on the plan.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Not giving fans a choice to watch the original theatrical versions in HD on Blu-ray is an insult to anyone that remotely cares about the integrity of the movie industry. I think I'll just go read Mein Kampf instead.
1932100660|5.0|This book was startling for me to read. I couldn't put it down and read it within a couple days from cover to cover. I learned so much and also have changed my life for the better as a result. After reading it, I couldn't go back. I had a desire to know more and read more on the various topics. It's scary how much we are influenced by various media as to what is \\"healthy.\\" Most people really know NOTHING of nutrition, yet think they know a lot. Doctors have little to no nutritional studies in medical school and we go to them for our \\"health\\" concerns. I wish everyone would read this book, but I think that there are some who would prefer not to know. It has really changed my life.
B0054A0CZY|5.0|Describing most year 2000+ music as pathetic is being generous, but it is good to know that there are still bands like Simple Plan bringing us good quality and FUN music.  This album is definitely Simple Plan's best showing, and it is a true gem which you will not want to miss.  The tracks featuring the guest singers are truly amazing and complement the rest of the album very well.  The combination of voice, lyrics, and music delivered by this band just works, and it works well.
B002IC10Y8|5.0|It is very difficult to write a comprehensive review of this collection of albums.  I use the word albums because many of the discs in the collection were initially released in either vinyl or on cassettes.  Lots already exist on cd.  The discs are housed in reproductions of the LP and can scratch the discs if the user is not conscious of this.  I haven't had any problems with scratches myself.      What are you getting here?  This is a relatively gimmick free box set.  You get a remastered 90 disc collection of 30 years of recordings from the greatest cellist in my lifetime and therefore this has a very eclectic range of styles.  Heavy on the classical recordings, but mixed in are his Brazilian efforts, Jazz and the collaborations with Mark O'Conner and many other amazing artists.  But at the center of each disc is the whimsical and wonderful cello played by Yo-Yo Ma.      * 90 CDs - every original album Yo-Yo Ma has recorded to date plus 2 Bonus Discs of unreleased and rare recordings   * Entirely remastered with DSD technology   * 312-page hard-bound book   * Archival photos, essays, full track lists, original liner notes, and more   * Beautifully designed, velvet-lined box   * Numbered limited-edition    The only way to know what number you are getting is to open it up, but each one is individually numbered.  The first few hundred included an autographed photo and a thank  you letter, but the initial price at release was much more higher.  It is nice without the photo and it is all housed in a nice looking box.  There are ribbons inside to help keep the place of the disc you are currently listening to.      It sounds fantastic and has so much incredible music that you are getting weeks of listening pleasure most of which holds up on repeated plays.  Put your headphones on and enter the world of a Master.  He will take you places you haven't heard before...
B0040JHLFY|4.0|Great shoes, this is my second pair of the same color and style, the first pair lasted 2+ years so of course I highly recommend them, especially to anyone looking for a stability shoe, and the shipper got them to me a day earlier than I'd expected.  Also consider looking at a running shoe buying guide, I hate shopping in a store, so it pays to do a bit of research on which running shoe is going to fit you perfect.
B003UESJFG|4.0|This movie is so much fun.  I believe the purchase was as much for me as it was my daughters.  It is a good movie with entertainment for children and adults.
1250004349|3.0|The Jewish experience during WWII in France was well done. I also liked the past/current  chapter technique...BUT what the writer did to the main character just does not make sense. You don't build up a strong character such as Sarah and then twist the plot to such an opposite degree near the last third of the book. Sarah's actions just make no sense. Even her initial discovery does not make much sense as she saw much of death since she left the apartment and she can count....Overall, good writing, good historial research  but BAD main character development.

This would have been a great family movie to spend quality time together.  I even bought my mother her own DVD.  The acting of the whole cast is outstanding.  Hachi will really steal your heart.  There needs to be more movies like this.  Have a box of Kleenex handy to wipe away the tears.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Heaven forbid Artoo doesn't have enough rocks to hide between on Tatooine. In all my life, I have never once heard anyone--anyone!--complain that the door to Jabba's palace was too small, or that Artoo's hiding spot was too obvious. Yet everywhere I go, for the last seven years, I've listened to many-a justified complaint about piss-poor lightsabre effects and the hideous blue tint that totally plagues Empire. I will be the millionth one to say this, but why would anyone in their right mind shell out this much money for a lackluster collection that's virtually the exact same as the error-ridden DVDs?    We don't need a dug in Jabba's palace. We don't need these extra things. We want the real issues addressed. And if that's too much to ask, then for Christ's sake, don't address ANYTHING.    Which brings me to my biggest complaint. Noooooooooooooooo, not the blinking ewoks. How dare George Lucas call this a perfect cut of the films, leave so many errors uncorrected, and then go on to completely ravage one of the few good things about Return of the Jedi. Vader's redemption has been destroyed and disrespected by the tacky, misplaced, and overemphasized \\"Nooooooooooo\\" from Revenge. I cannot fathom what goes on in George Lucas's head that makes him think it is okay to alter THE defining Star Wars moment. No words.    In short, this collection literally offers nothing. The documentaries can usually be ordered seperately on amazon. The deleted scenes will find their way to you, eventually. Do not waste your money on this piece of work.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|A fantastic keyboard app.  i use an older Android phone, the droid eris, but this app works well, has a fantastic word suggestion, and learns as you go.

0553801473|2.0|I am, I admit, new to A Song of Ice and Fire. I watched the fantastic series made by HBO and, as soon as the pilot ended, I picked up the books and fell in love. The first three volumes of this series, as any reader will know, are a tour de force of fantasy. A wonderfully realised world populated by fantastic characters that are loved and loathed to a high degree. An entanglement of plots is lightly touched by an unnerving thread of dark magic that lingers in the background to remind us that 'winter is coming'. I read the series, including the slower, less satisfactory 'A Feast for Crows' three times whilst waiting those couple of months for 'Dance'. Then this doorstop was in my hands and I read it eagerly, expecting a return to 'A Storm of Swords' quality.<br /><br />I, like so many others, was vastly disappointed. This novel sees the return of the 'protagonists' of the epic: Jon Snow (who still knows nothing), Daenerys Targaryen (who has looked back and is now facing the wrong direction) and everyone's favourite sarcastic dwarf Tyrion Lannister. However, these three fan favourites accomplish precisely one act of significance between them, and that is a vastly annoying cliffhanger-a now overused hallmark of Martin's writing.<br /><br />Jon Snow, stuck on the wall, is struggling to hold several factions together in the face of the approaching war with the Others in the long winter (which is supposedly still on its way, despite no evidence of it in this book). There are interesting parallels with Daenerys, who is trying to rule a city of people and customs that are not her own and who would gladly see her dead. Both of these young leaders struggle in their tasks. Jon grows into his position as a leader with satisfying, if not entirely realistic, maturity. His story arc is arguably the best of the three, but it ends in the most disgusting, hackneyed 'plot twist' I have ever seen. It WILL annoy the seven hells out of you.<br /><br />Daenerys actually DEVOLVES as a character. The strong-minded young woman from 'A Storm of Swords' has lost her fire and dithers around doing nothing for the entire book. The effect is, of course, to show that the dragon queen has much to learn about ruling (though this does not dent her huge entitlement complex). However, this could have been shown in less than half of her chapters, with the rest devoted to some progression-whether meeting more of the legions of people sailing her way, or getting to Asshai, or reuniting with the Dothraki or...or...SOMETHING. Instead, she remains ineffectual throughout the whole book, proving to be the young (and hormonal) girl that she claims to be, despite previously being a competent leader in control of her own emotions. This 180 degree turn is exceptionally annoying, but this is not the biggest disservice done by Martin to his characters.<br /><br />Tyrion Lannister, once the favourite of 90% of the fanbase, is reduced to wandering around asking where whores go, turtle-watching and playing chess. He is one of the many characters on his way to meet Daenerys, and this journey takes the entire book. And he still doesn't get there. His chapters, once full of intrigue, character development and humour, are a vapid travelogue-and not even a good one. Whilst he does develop (his interaction with Penny the dwarf is touching and exposes how good he did have it in Casterly Rock), he loses much of his charm and all of his humour. Bitterness is understandable in his position, but something about the way this bitterness is conveyed is unconvincing and unpalatable.<br /><br />What about everyone else? Arya's scenes are entertaining as always, Bran's are interesting if sparse. Davos' chapters are among the most enjoyable due to his meeting one of the best characters yet introduced-Wyman Manderley (why are Martin's side characters always more interesting than his main ones?), Theon's are haunting and disturbing, and 'disturbing' is cranked up to eleven in this book. If rape, mutilation, bestiality, cannibalism, torture, voyeuristic humiliation, intense diarrhea and even more intense stupidity offends you, give this a miss. New point of view, Ser Barristan Selmy, is fantastic, and the only well-done viewpoint in Essos. Everyone else is largely dull and uninspired, and most people do nothing but travel around. One 'huge' reveal of a character that was supposed to be dead is flat and poorly executed. It produces a 'oh.' rather than a 'WOAH :O'<br />Which leads me to my actual point:<br /><br />This is a book with several plot arcs building up to several promising climaxes. None of these climaxes arrive. We miss out on two major battles, we see Brienne (who ended 'Feast' in a cliffhanger) for a couple of pages which answer no questions before she whisks off Jaime Lannister into ANOTHER cliffhanger, several people are STILL travelling to meet Daenerys having accomplished nothing, and several people may or may not be dead. It is as if Martin bought himself two prize racehorses, Cliffhanger and Playing Around With Character Deaths, shot both of them and proceeded to beat them with a typewriter. A long, largely dull mess of travelogues leads to no climax, no katharsis, nothing of anything. It was a vast disappointment with a few high points, and I didn't have to wait for six years for it. I feel sorry for those souls who had a long wait filled with bad PR and timewasting on the part of the author. I fell in and out of love with this series in remarkably quick time, and I will be recommending this book to no one. Is winter coming? It is not known.
B0055V6EZE|3.0|Hmmm. There is no doubting the quality of the playing on this CD, nor of the heritage of the tunes, but I really don't like his voice. Sounds to me like a tribute act.    I can only question, would this be selling so well if it wasn't Hugh Lawrie on the album? I doubt it. I was drawn in based on a recommendation from a friend, but was disappointed.
1848566980|5.0|If you're a fan of sf art, or even glanced at the sf section of a bookstore during the 1970s or 1980s then you know Chris Foss.  This collection includes virtually all (if not all) of his published sf works.  Many of these have been published in previous Foss collections (21st Century Foss and Diary of a Spaceperson), but I think this includes all of those and then some.  This book is virtually all artwork, very well reproduced in color, mostly one to four paintings per page, which for the most part is large enough.  There doesn't seem to be much organization or structure in presenting the paintings for the most part, other than the groupings of Dune concept work, military/thriller book covers mostly in one place, but if there is an order to the sf paintings it eludes me.  There's basic information on each painting (title/book/publisher/date of the book cover it appeared on), an introduction by Rian Hughes, bio profile by daughter Imogene Foss, and brief appreciations/recollections by Moebius and Alejandro Jodorowsky who worked with Foss on an abortive 1970s film version of Dune.  There are well over 120 sketches from Dune concept work and other sf efforts, as well as a few samples of Foss's earlier and non-sf works.  I would have liked to see a few more sketches from his Diary of a Spaceperson work, or unpublished personal or other conceptual works.  Overall, however, this book lives up to its title as the definitive collection of Foss's work -- it  has essentially all of his major commercial works, and good samplings of his other art.  Finally, this book is a bargain at this price.  Well worth purchasing by anyone who enjoys science fiction and space art, or commercial illustration.
0670022411|1.0|I've seen this book EVERYWHERE, read rave reviews, and enjoyed the first chapter in the store. I thoroughly expected to find a wonderful first installment to a great series.    Wrong. I feel like the first chapter is akin to a movie preview: It made the book seem better than it really is.     In the (very) beginning, Diana seems like a very unique heroine: A professor who takes great pains to deny her gifts (a la Samantha from \\"Bewitched\\" except with a career...) Also in the (very) beginning, her eventual boyfriend and mate Matthew (ugh, I hate that term...) seems to have a lot of intriguing depth: Mind-boggling intelligent and very anti-social. Finally, the beginning of the plot seems very interesting: Diana calls up a manuscript - Ashmole 782 - that hasn't been seen for 150 years, and now everyone wants to get their hands on it and her.    Notice that the word 'seems' pops up. A lot.    In reality, the plot just drags and drags and drags: Diana sits in the library and reads manuscripts. She goes for a jog. She goes for a row. She does yoga. Matthew - what happened to him being anti-social and not liking women all that much? - follows her around. He takes her out for dinner. He takes her to yoga. They have dinner at her place. They have dinner at his place. They fall in love. No tension, no angst, just a laundry list of the stuff they do. I felt like I was reading a diary without date entries that chronicled EVERY. SINGLE. STUPID THING. that Diana did. After about 150 pages, I just started to skim. When they started to talk about things like Diana being the super ultra mega witch, I started to skim even faster. When I read anything about Matthew's protective instincts (which is usually a characteristic that I love in a hero) I threw my hands in the air because they were so inconsistent. And yet I stubbornly continued because SURELY something that has been raved about by so many MUST get better. When I finally got to the end, I did the equivalent of throwing the book against the wall: I deleted it from my e-reader and computer.       Now I've heard that Warner Brothers have acquired the movie rights to this book? WHY?     SO disappointed. I wish I too could send A Discovery of Witches away into Oxford's archives and not be able to retrieve it ever again.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Ok, so I was going to hold out until the Blu-Ray comes out so I could review the movie as well as all the extras but I saw this again over the weekend in a cheapo theater (already saw it twice before). So, maybe I won't need to get the Blu-Ray right away. Anyway, here's my review of just the movie.<br /><br />First of all, those debating on the prequel/reboot issue and all that, here's my take on it. What they did was follow the continuity of the first two X-men movies, ignoring X3 and the Wolverine movie. If you keep that in mind while watching First Class, it should make sense as a prequel with no continuity errors. The problem was, people were complaining about all the inconsistencies with all the X-Men movies and Wolvie, so they had to peddle back and call it a reboot instead.<br /><br />Now, I really liked X1 & X2, didn't care much for those other ones. I think though that First Class not only captured what was great about those first two movies but also improved on some things. This one had a lot of action, was quite violent, had meaningful characters, some old some new, had a great story carrying it through and still managed to pay homage to Singer's franchise in a couple brief moments. Of course, it was no great surprise to me. Singer still produced it and the guy calling the shots was Matthew Vaughn, the same guy who was behind Kick-Ass, which many argue (including myself) was a rare exception in that the movie surpassed and improved on the comic.<br /><br />It was entertaining throughout its entire two hour run time. Yes it's a popcorn flick but it also has a lot more to it. You get to witness the birth of the war between humans and mutants, as well as the birth of Charles' X Men and Magneto's brotherhood. It's also one of those movies that gets better every time you see it. There's a lot of little nuances and references that you might miss (or not connect) the first time around. Plus, knowing how it's going to end somehow doesn't stop you from enjoying the ride along the way.<br /><br />What else can I say? If you haven't seen First Class because you were weary after X3 & Origins, trust me, they got it right this time around. Rent it, buy it, do whatever it is you do to watch movies but see it. You won't be disappointed.
0440244412|5.0|WOW! that's all i can really say. if you're following the series, you will NOT be disappointed by the final book! it pretty much blew my mind more times than i can count, and in a good way! i only had 1 small disappointment at the end, which i won't mention as it could be a spoiler, but other than that tiny thing i could barely put the book down all weekend i was so anxious to find out how everything turns out! (trust me on this one, my husband kept laughing at me that i could never put it down for more than like an hour at a time!) amazing end to a series that i can't believe i didn't even like at first! if you think about stopping after book #1, DON'T, trust me, it gets way way better and you'll thank yourself you decided to give the series a chance!
B004SGWYVA|4.0|I had waited a long time for this series to come out and have looked for it forever.  Netflix got it and I couldnt have been happier, until I watched it.  As stated it is over the top with the boobs.  If you ignore them and watch the story it really is pretty good.  I like the zombies and I believe it is pretty accurate in what would happen during the beginning out a zombie outbreak.  I personally liked the voice acting and the action is top notch.  I like the characters and they all add something to the mix of the story.  My only issue is the placement of the breasts in the story.  It does distract from the overall story and if someone would go back and redo it and take out 90 percent of the breast shots, which would still leave enough for the average person it would be a whole lot better.  I do understand the audience the story tell was aiming for and while I dont understand all of the Japanese culture I do understand a lot.  The person was trying to aim for two audiences and should have only tried for one.  In my case the zombie audience would have been it.  Still worth a watch though and I personally think the pros out weigh the cons by a lot.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am like many fans. I want the ORIGINAL Star War films on Blu Ray.   No CGI extras.  No CGI edits.     Just the original films that we all grew up on.   LucusFilms does not care about the fans that made them billions of dollars.   Maybe when George Lucas dies , and his money hungry company need quick cash, then they will release them.   AVOID THIS VERSION LIKE THE PLAGUE !     ** Wait until a smart fan bootlegs it onto blue Ray. Then buy it ! **

B0043GXYBO|4.0|Marked was a fun boarding school, magical, vampire book that feels familiar because of all the other books you've ever read that uses one of those scenarios.  In this case, Zoey is the special character who enters the House of Night school with her own special talents.  There is the love interest that she likes right off, and a series of friends who are jealous of her and want to see her go down, but the real point is that Zoey has something unique about her that gives her advanced powers.<br /><br />I have seen Marked floating around for some time and have many students who have read the series.  I finally decided to read it for myself and thought that it was better than I expected.  Although it has a very strong YA feel to it that will make it appeal mainly to teens (as it should), the story is fun and engaging without being too dark.  I liked Zoey's friends and the characters that she interacted with.  The magic and paranormal elements in the story were interesting as well, and didn't feel too far-fetched to really believe they could exist.  Overall, I can see why this series has gotten so much attention.  In the teen vampire genre, this one has its own fun twist that helps it stand out.
B004GJYROG|5.0|I remember I was 4 years old when this movie came out. And I have loved it ever since. Although I'm not a big sports girl I love that the luny toons were playing basketball with Michael Jordan against the evil aliens the Monstars! I always loved how the movie is half real half cartoon world. Its a great movie for every age group. I'm 19 and still watch it.

B004G600A4|5.0|I stumbled over this movie on Netflix and decided to \\"kill some time\\" by watching it. Let me tell you, not one minute was wasted !

An absolut winner ! It will be added to my permanent collection!

B001QOOCTE|5.0|I first became aware of Playing For Change on a Bill Moyers television show.

B0056BU3I2|4.0|Most movie franchises, by the time they reach the fifth entry, have lost a lot of the original luster.  This is one of the excpetions.  There is nothing particularly new--the characters are still on the wrong side of the law, they still do things with cars most of us wouldn't dare to dream about and they look good while doing it.<br /><br />The new wrinkle in this one is The Rock--excuse, Dawyne Johnson--as a super Fed hot on their tails after they get wrongly accused for the murders of some federal agents.  But rather than running, the crew decides to pull \\"one last job so they can retire\\".<br /><br />None of this is original, and plot and logic errors abound, but they still manage to put together a very enjoyable film, especially the third act, which gives us the most vehicular mayhem seen since [[ASIN:B001AQO446 The Blues Brothers [Blu-ray]]].
B001VZY4MS|4.0|A fantastic and extremely underrated album in Neil Young's catalog!  Released in Nov. of 1968, it came only 6 months after Buffalo Springfield played their last show at The Long Beach Arena and called it a day.  With that being said, Neil's first solo effort very much sounds like he still has one foot in the Springfield and the other trying to strike out on his own.  It's safe to say that most, if not all, of these songs were written when Neil was still with his former band.  The album's most popular track, \\"The Loner,\\" is more akin to \\"Mr. Soul\\" than it is \\"Southern Man,\\" but that's not a bad thing.  It's almost like you're getting the best of both worlds for a brief spell.  It's the most ROCKING song on the album and a hint of things to come (i.e. \\"Cinnamon Girl\\"), but mainly the album is a laid back affair, recalling Neil's breezier moments with the Springfield.  He hasn't quite established his trademark \\"rusty nail\\" or \\"trudging through the desert\\" guitar sound, but what he has got on his debut is some great songwriting and arrangements (and stellar musicianship).  \\"The Old Laughing Lady\\" showcases some jazzy time signature changes influenced by fellow L.A. rock band and Topanga Canyon neighbors to Neil, Spirit.  Some of the arrangement choices on the album are a bit premature and not necessarily in the best of taste, such as hooking Neil up with Ray Charles' back up singers for two tracks (sisters Patricia and Brenda Hollaway and Shirley Mathews).  It works, but only to a small degree.  It's most likely they recorded their backing vocals for this album around the same time they were providing vocals for Joe Cocker's \\"Feelin' Alright\\" (who was in town during the fall of '68).  \\"The Last Trip To Tulsa\\" closes the album on a strong and haunting note.
0345529057|1.0|first i must say that the books are awesome (from what ive been able to read) next i must say that when i reached page 200ish every page before that fell out as if they were never glued down. now i take very good care of my books and this just pissed me off because now I either have to reglue it or buy a new copy of a game of thrones.
078322737X|5.0|I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 50's and 60's.  I can identify with just about everything in that movie.  Also, I had a lot of family that lived in the Valley.  I visited that area a lot growing up.  I have watched it everytime it plays on cable in our area.  And I could never tire of it.  I decided to buy the movie because if I am having a down day, watching that movie can put me in the greatest frame of mind.  Just going back in time to those wonderful days that looking back now were so carefree and happy.  For me anyway.  Everybody should own a copy of American Graffiti.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Please, please, please! No more changes. They don't add anything. I love the inclusion of deleted scenes, but I hate all of the new CGI effects. I bought the Special Edition from Best Buy in 2004. It included the untouched original versions of the original films. I still watch them and only let my kids watch them. Guess what, they LOVE them! All of the new effects look fake and out of place. Why doesn't Lucasfilm listen to their fans??    I will hold off on buying this and just rent them from Netflix.
1400052181|5.0|I chose this book for a report in my Racial and Ethnic Studies course. It is an excellent book. It is easy to read - written like a story and not sterile facts. Skloot brings Henrietta and her family to life and you are able to see the problems from all perspectives. It doesn't paint one point of view as all good and the other as all bad. Many racially-based books creates a villain and this one doesn't.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I've enjoyed the Star Wars films since I was a child. I grew up watching the original trilogy more times than I can remember. Star Wars is more than just a series of films. Its an experience. Countless awards, nominations, and honours have been given to these films. When Lucasfilm announced the definitive release of Star Wars, images of the Blade Runner, or the Alien Quadrilogy Blu ray releases come to mind. A fully restored, remastered set, full of the special features that fans crave. Multiple versions of the film(s) so viewers can watch each version, compare them, and find which they enjoy more. A definitive collection in every sense.    Sadly this set is not that. The 2004 DVD releases had many issues. Issues that made the changes seen in the 1997 releases even worse. Fans lament these changes for many reasons. In addition to these changes the remastering process left many new issues in the films. Colours were off or flat out wrong, effects were messed up due to the changes implemented. Changing the movies to fit a directors cut isn't the issue, the issue is keeping the original version available. Something that George Lucas not only fails to do, but he is actually trying to keep the Original releases from seeing the light of day.     The Bluray release of Star Wars comes with a slew of new unneeded changes. These changes are even infuriating non-hardcore Star Wars fans. Among them is the now famous \\"Noooooooooo\\" heard around the internet. The subtlety of the films have now, by and large been lost, which is a real shame. The remastering process has also created issues with the colouring, yet again. Lightsabre colours are still not correct. Digital additions of CGI create continuity errors that were not there previously. Lucasfilm stated that they went over the entire saga and did a frame by frame restoration. Instead we got blanket colour correction and audio tweaks that hurt key scenes in the films. Only select shots have had actual frame by frame restoration.The remastering process effort seemed to be more focused in adding a digital Yoda (a Change that I don't really mind), and digital Ewok eyes. Audio changes sound horrible and pasted over the existing track which is a real shame considering that Skywalker Sound is the go to for quality sound mastering.    The real tragedy here isn't the changes; its the absolute lack of original versions for these movies. As George Lucas himself so adamantly fought against the colouring and restoration of Black and White films, we now have to fight against the once crusader to try to save the original Star Wars movies from him. A true definitive edition would contain at the very least the Original Theatrical versions and George Lucas' re-imagining. But preferably every version (like 'em or hate 'em). The only way to show Lucasfilm our distaste for these \\"Remastered\\" versions is to exercise the most powerful tool that we as consumers have. Choice.     I have cancelled my pre-order for the set. It is not the product that was described or originally offered to me. I will not give George Lucas more money for this set because he will be encouraged to keep making more changes and since people keep buying them he has no incentive to stop. I hope that more people will cancel their pre-orders, and not purchase this set. Only through these actions can film-makers see that its the public that truly has the power, and hopefully they will then begin to listen to the people that they once a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away used to make films for.

B005COO1X6|2.0|I have read Stephen King for years.  I have seen several movies from his books.  I have been entertained for the most part, but disappointed at other times.

B001P3SA8U|4.0|If you're more than passing familiar with the birth and growth of Chess Records of Chicago and the careers of Leonard Chess, Muddy Waters, Etta James, etc., there's a lot that's frustrating about this movie. How did Chuck Berry end up singing \\"No Particular Place To Go\\" in the late 50s when he didn't write and record it until 1964? Where's Phil Chess, brother of Leonard, and Marshall Chess, son of Leonard, who had a LOT to do with the success of the label? The title at the beginning that says \\"This film is based upon true events\\" rings a lot more accurately than one might suppose, with the chronology all out of whack and a LOT of supposition about how things were back then by Darnell Martin, who wrote the screenplay as well as directed this movie.<br /><br />And yet, when you see how ably all of the actors embody their roles and how much Martin has gotten the grit and muscle of this piece of American musical history, these frustrations drop away and seem like mere nitpicking. More than anything it shows the crossroads where two different minority cultures---African-Americans and Jewish emigrants from Europe---find a bond and help it grow, through a combination of mutual self-interest and admiration. It doesn't hurt, too, that the music throughout is HOT, even after all these years. All of the actors are superb, with Eamonn Walker as Howlin' Wolf and Columbus Short as the doomed Little Walter particularly grabbing your attention every time they're onscreen. Adrien Brody's portrayal of Leonard Chess shows a man who's sincere about his love for the music he records and the musicians making it, while at the same time not above bribes and a little backstage double-dealing to further his ends. And Jeffrey Wright's Muddy Waters and Beyonce's Etta James ring true to their sources and then some.<br /><br />In sum: a real treat for first-time viewers, and one of the best films of 2008.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|Dirty Dancing takes place in an era (the early '60s) where the rules of social engaging were completely different from the modern day. Frances \\"Baby\\" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) has been vacationing in the Catskills with her family for many years. Uneventfully. One summer, she falls under the sway of dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Baby is a pampered pup, but Johnny is a man of the world. Baby's father, Jake (Law and Order's Jerry Orbach), can't see the basic decency in greaser Johnny that she can. It should come as no surprise to find that Baby, who can be as immature as her name, learns more about love and life--and dancing--from free-spirited Johnny than traditionalist Jake.    I LOVE this movie!! The DVD itself is great and the bonuses are an even better treat. There are interviews, still photos, videos showing different scenes from different angles and lots of other goodies.     If you love Dirty Dancing, I really recommended getting this DVD. You won't be disappointed!

I won't even address all the complaints of those fans who worried about \\"silly\\" things like video quality and audio mixing.

B0058A119G|5.0|I go back to Barbra at the Crystal Palace in St. Louis a half-century ago and at that point I think everyone who heard her already knew we were hearing the voice of the century, now centuries.  I am astounded this album debuted at #4 because it centers on:  Beautiful melodies  Intelligent lyrics  Rich stories from real life  Sumptuous arranging and conducting  And a singer who, at this late date, still sounds young, fresh, inquisitive and forever tempted to take chances, go against the prevailing winds and do what she does the way she wants to do it.  Given what's selling on the market today it's amazing to me any artist could produce this kind of work and get sales too (despite the New York Times review sniffing at this as music of an era gone by...not if debuted at #4, folks!).  Barbra has always said she is an actress who sings, and I always acknowledged that but also felt it in a way was second best.  Really great singers live the song rather than perform it (certainly that is the case with Joni James, who worked with a delicate instrument but got miles from it in emotion and truth).  But in recent years Barbra has sort of blended acting her songs WITH living her songs and I think it's made all the difference.  She has traded perfection for the diamond of imperfection and it's made her recent music even more worth giving attention to.  At this point, I think, she will never wither as an artist, just keep growing.  She's always had her eye and heart fixed on quality and legacy.   In the process, she has enriched countless lives all over the world.
0446547603|2.0|Just happened to pick up a copy of Nicholas Sparks' Safe Haven for a quick read on the plane ride home last week.  The week previous, I read Joshilyn Jackson's Backseat Saints.   The similarites in these two novels is MUCH more than coincidence...the themes of abuse, self-identity, redemption are similar, but the really striking similarities are more detailed. Both authors write about a childless, abused woman in her late twenties stealing identity from an elderly neighbor, inspired and led by a spiritual presence (s), meeting a gray-haired love interest, and eventually killing or being present at the death of her abusive husband. Both authors move between past and present throughout the novel, although Jackson is definitely the more skilled writer. There are differences, but the similarities are far more obvious. Does the Muse strike two authors at the same time with the same inspiration????

0312588887|3.0|\\"A Woman of Substance\\", about Emma Harte's life, from poor kitchen maid to powerful business leader and matriarch, is a good story, but the book could have been shorter. Especially in the first half, it's weighed down by way too detailed desciptions of furniture and clothes that distract from the story, at least for those readers who don't share the author's passion for interior design and fashion. The pace picks up in the second half and the book kept my interest. With tighter plotting this might have been a four star book. 3+
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was very excited about the release of Star Wars on blu-ray until George Lucas decided to get involved with the damn process. Once again he thinks making changes to the movies are for the better when in fact all he is doing is pissing off his fan base. You would think he would have learned the last time he made changes, but \\"NOOOOOOOOO\\". Pre-order canceled and I want nothing to do with this now. The once brilliant man has completely lost it. For anyone else who is upset about this, make a statement with your wallet. DON\\"T BUY.
1439153663|5.0|Just a spectacular novel. This is the first book I've read that wasn't YA in a very long time, and it didn't disappoint. Though it's set in the eighteenth century, there was constant drama and enough dark themes to keep me emotionally-charged the entire journey. After closing the book, I felt like I'd lost old friends. I can't wait to see what Grissom writes next!

4789009637|5.0|This is the book used at my language school run by local Japanese. It has great clarity in the way it teaches the language. For further practice there are also CDs [[ASIN:4789009866 Genki 1: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese 1]]. This is the best book I have been able to find for adults.
0375507256|5.0|I resisted reading Cloud Atlas for a long time because the hype around it was just too much. I assumed that this was going to be just another post-modern creative writing exercise gone awry. The kind of thing that gets lit crit people all hot and bothered, but that fails to deliver an engaging narrative. Boy was I wrong. This is an excellent, engrossing book.    There are times when you're reading Cloud Atlas when you just have to stop and ask yourself \\"Holy mother of God, how does he do that?\\" especially toward the end. When you step back and think about this book once you've read it, you realize it shouldn't work at all, and yet it does, somehow, miraculously. The only explanation for that is that David Mitchell is just one insanely talented guy. No doubt about it.

0553801473|1.0|There are so many well written reviews of this disappointing tome, I probably don't even need to add mine to the (steaming) pile.  I think that speaks to just how horribly wrong this book veered, no plummeted, into boring, long-winded, and futile storytelling.  If there could be a sixth bok as well written as the first three, you could very easily skip 4, and especially this one 5, and pick back up without torturing yourself.  But that's a big if...it will require a tremendous change of energy and inspiration from the author, and probably an entirely new editing staff.<br /><br />One aspect that really bothered me, as other reviewers have mentioned, was the growing use of sexist comments and gratuitous S&M sex scenes.  I mean, I'm an adult, I have no problem with a little raunchiness, but come on!  Apart from Arya, who was certainly not spared because of her age but thankfully was spared, EVERY SINGLE FEMALE character in DWD was reduced to a sexual object at some point.  And the language was far more sexist, violently sexual, and graphic than it was in earlier books.  Again, I'm not a prude, but it definitely turned me against the author...I've gone from envisioning him as an amazingly imaginative grandfather guy to a creepy sex offender.  I used to recommend his books to others, but will not anymore...I would be embarrassed to be the person who recommended this series, given the horrible cesspool it has devolved into.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|More changes have been made to our once beloved trilogy.    Lucas is out of control. It's obvious he doesn't have a gift when it comes to subtlety and he has a profound lack of respect for the work he and others have done. He is not a professional and he is not a filmmaker. He is a salesmen.    Here is what you get for $90:    - The PT. Three of the worst films to have come out during the last decade.  - The Phantom Menace, complete with horrid picture quality, making Maul and Qui-Gon out to be wax statues!  - The hackjobs that are the Special Editions    Save your money.

0765350386|5.0|If you are looking for an innovative, epic fantasy, Mistborn is it! This book is so much more than your typical lord of the rings type fantasy. It contains one of the most original and innovative magic systems I have ever seen. I love the way that Sanderson managed to thoroughly describe the world, politics, and magic system without ever making me bored. Trust me, politics in books normally bores the crap out of me! That is a feat in itself.<br /><br />To start, Brandon Sanderson writes some amazing characters! Not only are they believable and consistent, but they are just plain likeable. And I'm not just talking about the main characters! Some of the most entertaining and heartbreaking scenes involved the secondary characters. There was something about Kelsier and Vin that I just fell in love with. Their relationship was like that of father and daughter. Kelsier, though he could be egotistical and manipulative at times, maintained hope in even the most grim of situations. Seeing Vin go from a scrawny, insecure, abused girl to a confident and trusting woman was incredibly rewarding and inspiring. She certainly grew throughout the story, thanks to the incredible cast of characters. I could go on and on about how much I love them all... I'm just happy I should have another couple books to get to know them better!<br /><br />The plot of Mistborn was extremely well thought out. Sanderson constantly had me on edge thinking that the crew might give up or fail. I don't want to go in depth with the plot and give something away though. I can, however, tell you that the fight scenes throughout the book were amazing and well choreographed. What a treat!<br /><br />I was excited to find a developing romance in this book as well! I honestly did not expect one but it was a most definitely a pleasant discovery. Once again, you won't squeeze the details out of me! Just know that the relationship is cute and awesome.<br /><br />If you are a fantasy fan like me, then I can pretty much guarantee that you will love this book. It was refreshing and original like no other fantasy I have read. I already have the next two books and will hopefully get around to reading them before the end of the year! What was originally supposed to be a trilogy will have a new addition, [[ASIN:0765330423 The Alloy of Law: A Mistborn Novel]] on November 12th, 2011!<br /><br />For more of my reviews and giveaways visit Inklings Read!his book.

B004XQO90O|4.0|The trick is you can repeat those eight minutes until you find him.<br />Take this simple premise; add in a super secret government experiment, personal lives and some compassion.  Mix well and make into an entertaining movie.  Saying more would convert this from a review into a spoiler.  The film never drags nor is it repetitious.  Each segment is the same but with a different twist as the list of suspects narrows down to the terrorist.  The ending is a real surprise and great fun.  This is not Shakespeare, Williams or another great playwright.  The dialog supports the story and the acting supports the dialog.  Both are entertaining and keep our attention.<br />I found this to be an enjoyable way to spend an evening.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|This review is meant for 99% (or more) of the audience that is interested in Star Wars and may buy the new Complete Saga on Blu-Ray.  It is not meant for Star Wars fanatics who focus on minute details and simply cannot bring themselves to see the forest through the trees regarding this product.  They are a separate class of customer for this product and seem to have written 90% of the reviews as they have an enormous amount of negative energy regarding seemingly insignificant issues compared to the vast majority of the interested population.    The primary experience of watching Star Wars is included in this set. The emotions I experienced watching the trilogy in the 70s and 80s as a teenager and young adult are the same. The same goes for the Prequal movies made and released much later. The only real differences being the picture is clearer Blu-Ray quality and the sound has been upgraded. No more, no less. The subtle differences appreciated by extremely serious Star Wars fans just do not matter to the vast majority of fans.    I view the overall poor rating of 2 stars for this set as absurd. It lacks the common sense most people have. I mean lets be honest. Star Wars is truly a motion picture phenomenon. For most people who love Star Wars the opportunity to purchase and enjoy this amazing collection of movies with upgrades in picture and sound is appreciated. I regard it as a welcome addition to my Blu-Ray collection. I also keep perspective - as most people do - that Star Wars is great entertainment but in the larger scheme of life it is ONLY entertainment.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|This product was perfect and came early. It was exactly what i wanted the frst 3 starwars just great movies
0385335997|5.0|Let me begin by saying that I LOVED this book. The pacing was so much better than Dragonfly in Amber. I never once felt frustrated. To recap, I said that it was frustrating to read such long chunks of text set when Claire returned to present times. Gabaldon remedied that problem in Voyager by alternating Claire's actions in the present with Jamie's actions in the past. For example, Brianna uncovers the legend of Dunbonnet and surmises that it is about her father. The next chapter, then, shifts to Jamie and his actions that show him as the Dunbonnet. Little touches like these give the book incredible pacing and allows the reader to be sucked into the story. One of the most important jobs for an authors is to get readers to invest themselves in the story. This is also one of the hardest things for an author to accomplish.<br /><br />I also think that the setting ultimately helped the story's pacing. Though some of the story is still set in Scotland, much of it is also set at sea and/or in the Caribbean. It provides such a drastic change of scenery to the story that I couldn't help but wonder how Jamie and Claire would react in any given situation. As always, though, Jamie and Claire are brave, defiant, and insanely in love.<br /><br />Overall, this book as adventure, mystery, intrigue, surprise, suspense, a sea voyage, a shipwreck, and all the smoldering passion a reader needs to be entertained. Gabaldon truly gives us a page-turner.

0553801473|4.0|A Dance with Dragons is a far more satisfying read than the previous novel, A feast of Crows. It ties up a lot of the loose ends left in Feast and leaves the story in a very exciting place at the end.The focus shifts to Daenaries in the west and to Jon Snow on the wall(two of my favourite characters).It also revisits Arya (I thought the end of Feast of Crows was particularly cruel to her). Strongly recommend.
B004H1YH66|5.0|I'm really glad I followed the advice to buy this recording over the OST.  The sound quality is great and you get additional tracks not included on the OST.  This is a re-creation, not a re-interpretation of the original score.  The Prague Orchestra sticks as close to the original sound as you could ask for.  Magnificent recording of an awesome film score.  If you must have the original poster art, buy both recordings!

0553573411|5.0|Two quick complaints.  Robin Hobb's novels aren't that easy to find. She has thoroughly engaged me with her writing style and amazing, deft characterizations in her novels, but I can't find any of her works at the local bookstore. Grr. Barnes & Noble can go ride a zucchini, whatever that means. And secondly, Hobb has, possibly, the worst biographical blurb of any book I've ever read: \\"Robin Hobb is a writer, and lives in Washington state.\\" Huh?  Okay, I know Robin Hobb is a pseudonym, but really?<br /><br />OK. Now on to real things. A the end of the previous novel of the Farseer Series, Assassin's Apprentice (my review here), FitzChivalry is caught up in court intrigue, and his jealous uncle, Regal, schemes to kill the young bastard prince. He, and his caretaker, Burrich, are brutalized and nearly killed, in the capital of the Mountain Kingdom. After several months of recuperation, Fitz decides that never again will he take up the cause of the Farseer throne.<br /><br />Of course, you know how this sort of thing is bound to turn out. Within 150 pages, he's off and murdering a new threat, The zombie-like Forged Ones, whose souls have somehow been erased by the Out Island pirates. Can you kill a man, if he is no longer who he was? It's a question for a better ethicist than I am.<br /><br />FitzChivalry discovers his strong rapport with the Wit (beast magic) and, nearly against his will, bonds himself to a wolf pup called Nighteyes. If someone discovers Fitz's Wit Magic, it may be punishable by death.<br /><br />A second subtext running through the novel is Fitz's romance with his childhood friend, Molly. The information of him, as the king's Assassin, must be hidden from her. She knows him as an errand-boy, and he must pile secret upon secret, in order to protect her from the trouble his career would bring her. How many secrets must your bury yourself in, before you are no longer yourself? I would not be surprised if Fitz's morose questioning reminds readers of prince Hamlet. At several points, he considers suicide to escape his fate.<br /><br />Once again, Hobb excels at crafting a world and characters that are real and engaging. Her story is engaging, and not at all pedestrian. Her characters do not shy away from real emotions, although occasionally, you want to grab young FitzChivalry and slap him upside the head.<br /><br />Hobb manages something that I haven't experienced in a very long time. The characters in the novels became friends: I actually cared what happened to them. Although it's an excellent story, it's definitely a \\"middle\\" novel of a trilogy. The reader is left with the desire to scamper to the nearest bookstore and find the third book, and start it immediately. Of course, the novel, in all probability, won't be on the shelves and you'll have to Special Order the silly thing. I didn't find it at my three local bookstores in Virginia, but managed to locate the third book in a bookshop in California, a mere 3,500 miles away.

0060775858|5.0|When my husband picked out this book for our 14 month old daughter recently, I thought to myself; yikes this book is pretty dull for a active little girl like ours that is always grabbing for the shiniest prettiest things. I wondered if she would like it as much as the colorful counting book I had chosen. Since the very first time I showed it to her she loved it and daily brings it to me to sit and look at or let me read to her, unlike the colorful counting book that usually lies on the floor as a rug mat or a 2 second look at book. She somehow finds Goodnight Moon soothing and comforting and when all fails to calm her for nap time or bed this book does. She even looks at the black and white pages and points at items. She loves this book and truly I think it is a charmer. I even find myself thinking the lines in my head, they are contagious! Worth every penny!

B002PEP4SC|3.0|This was an ok book. The story was fast paced and interesting, but I felt that the character development and description was lacking. Since this is based on one of my favorite TV shows, I imagine that the ghost authors assumed that the reader would effortlessly picture Fillion and cast in the roles of the book characters. For some reason I really had to struggle to picture Rook as Nathan Fillion. Rook was a very flat character with little charm for me. I was entertained but it was hardly the bestseller worthy of being written by the great Richard Castle.

B003O5MO6G|5.0|When Younger Than Yesterday came out in 1967, The Byrds were losing altitude. Their cross-breeding of folk with rock 'n roll,  an innovation that had put them in the front rank of popular bands from 1965-1966, had largely been assimilated by the music industry. They were still well-liked and even respected, but they were also Old News. Which was a shame, because this album warranted a better reception. It continued the experimention with musical styles and forms they undertook in their first three albums while retaining the distinctive sound of Roger McGuinn's 12-string Rickenback and Chris Hillman's bass. There were elements of satire (\\"So You Want to be a Rock 'N Roll Star,\\" a not so subtle slam on The Monkees), Sci-Fi (\\"CTA-102,\\" about the search for extra-terrestrial life), Beatle-esque pop (\\"Have You Seen Her Face\\" and \\"Thoughts and Words\\"), country (\\"Time Between\\" and \\"The Girl With No Name\\") and the requisite Bob Dylan cover (\\"My Back Pages\\") - few if any performers were ever better at covering Dylan than The Byrds.     David Crosby kicked in two meditations. One is successful (\\"Everybody's Been Burned,\\" about the need to find love whatever the pain it has previously cost you) the other not so much (\\"Mind Gardens,\\" about the dangers of over-protecting the thing you love. It's a free verse poem that could have used more work on its mode of delivery, to my ears anyway). That leaves \\"Renaissance Fair\\" and \\"Why.\\" The one is kinda psychedelic, I guess, but a throwaway. The other is kinda psychedelic, kinda Beatles, kinda country, and kinda hard to categorize. If you like The Byrds you'll probably like it.    I don't know if I'd call this their best album - you could make the case, but you could also make as good a case for Fifth Dimension or Sweetheart of the Rodeo - but it's certainly a worthy entry in their catalog and in music history.
B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|Helen Mirren has star billing in THE DEBT, and while her performance is yet another in a long line of noteworthy turns..the real reason to see this film NOW is Jessica Chastain.  Chastain, who garnered significant acclaim for THE TREE OF LIFE and then pretty much stole all her scenes in THE HELP, continues her star-making year with a complex, even riveting performance in THE DEBT.    The movie jumps around in time a bit, but is never difficult to follow.  We meet three aging former Mossad agents (Helen Mirren, Tom Wilkenson (her ex-husband, confined to a wheelchair) and Ciaran Hinds.  All three are clearly unhappy and we learn pretty quickly that they are carrying a secret knowledge about the time they spent together 30 years previously in East Berlin.  At that time, they were assigned to capture and bring back to Israel a noted Nazi war criminal (Jesper Christensen).   SOMETHING happened during that time.  Much of the film is an explanation of what that SOMETHING was...and then, how the aged protagonists will deal with the consequences when the pigeons return to roost.    When the \\"secret\\" is revealed, it's a doozy because we have been set up very nicely.  But WHAT the secret turns out to be is far less important than HOW the secret has seeped into and poisoned almost every aspect of their lives.  This is a low-key espionage thriller that also serves as an interesting exploration of ethics.  At the risk of revealing too much, I won't discuss what those ethics are...but suffice it to say that when over, audiences of THE DEBT will likely spend more time discussing moral dilemmas than they will on the plot.    It's a solid plot, with some very tense scenes set in those early days in East Berlin.  Chastain is the young Mirren, a new agent on her first assignment.  She's eager but very naïve.  And very vulnerable emotionally to spending so much time living in a truly lousy loft with two handsome but very different men.  Sam Worthington (from AVATAR, and quite effectivein this very quiet role) is the young version of Hinds...he's a deeply reserved man who clearly carries deep feelings.  This attracts Chastain, but his reticence pushes her into the arms of the team leader (Marton Csokas), a far more charismatic and forward man...but also vaguely repellant.  The dynamic of these three is very interesting...and becomes much more so when they capture their prey.  This experienced (and very evil) predator smoothly plays the 3 agents not so much against each other, but against their own inner doubts.  The group threatens to unravel.    I think I've said all I dare about the substance of THE DEBT.  But I must praise the very good performances all around.  Wilkinson and Worthington are nice in their roles.  Mirren, not surprisingly, is terrific in a very non-glamorous role...and in the movie's final few scenes, she is quite stunning.  Csokas, looking like a young Russell Crowe, is as charismatic as he character requires, and I look forward to this performance launching him into a stronger career.  Christensen is chilling...the role of \\"old Nazi war criminal\\" is almost a cliché in films now, but here is seems freshly creepy.  And Chastain is the emotional heart of the film and she hits all her marks.  Her amazing bone structure grabs your attention first, but her subtle performance makes her the focal point of every scene she's in.   She's a star.    So, there are many reasons to see THE DEBT.  It's not perfect...some of the modern scenes in Israel have little spark to their staging.  Occasionally the emotions on display teeter on the brink of melodrama.  But it's a very entertaining, thought-provoking film for adult audiences and I highly recommend it.

Alex makes it his mission to get under Brittany's skin. Brittany struggles to keep him off her mind and focus her attention on her boyfriend.<br /><br />This book was so well written, and showed a very realistic view of life in a gang. I loved both Brittany and Alex. Alex is a part of a gang but wants better for not only himself but his family.<br /><br />Getting to know Alex, you learn that being in a gang is not something he truly wanted, but something he felt he had to do to protect his family. Outwardly he appears to be this bad boy, but underneath it all he's a really good guy caught up in a bad situation. It goes to show that you can't always judge a person on their outward appearance.<br /><br />His interaction with Brittany was great great! I loved every minute of his teasing and flustering her. You can see why Brittany fell for his bad boy ways.<br /><br />The storyline flowed smoothly and kept me so very engaged from start to finish. Elkeles provided such vivid detail that made you feel as if you were living the story instead of reading it. This definitely won't be my last book by Elkeles.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|This is great. This remake is truly a magnificent piece of art. The sound is great, it'll blow your head off, and the visuals are excellent. The freshened-up storyline is quite a bit more exciting than the one I remember from the original series. But all essence of Evangelion is there - It's exciting, sometimes funny, sometimes pervert-funny, sometimes focused on character psychology, etc. Highly recommended if you're a fan of the original series, and also if you're not familiar with it!

B0053VKP8S|4.0|The unit does exactly what it says, converts digital audio to analog audio. One review mentioned it sounding like a car alarm and not working. This is because it cannot decode dolby digital. Any modern tv should have the option to output in linear PCM. This requires no decoding by the unit itself and so it works. You can also change this setting on the electronics you are using (in my case a PS3 and an apple tv).  Remember this and you will be fine.        Also it uses a mini USB port for power, I have not tested this yet, but it would seem that you could use the usb port on your tv for power using a usb cable.      Solid build, great sound.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|[[ASIN:B004HO6I4W Rio (Blu-ray/ DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]]  An excellent movie. The whole family enjoyed it and we will be watching it many times in the future.  A must have for any collection.
0307477479|4.0|A complex, sometimes bizarre and unsatisfying, but ultimately engaging and hopeful look at the inevitable passage of time (the goon squad) and its ability to wound and destroy, heal and make whole.<br /><br />There is not a plot in the conventional sense as the novel works back and forward through time focusing on characters that briefly pop up in previous or later chapters but ultimately creating a web of interconnected lives. That's why it's almost essential that you keep track of who all these people are and how they are related.  You'll think someone is unimportant but then 100 pages later that person will get a full chapter devoted to them.  (almost) Everyone matters, maybe this is like life. People that you think are insignificant(your father's secretary, your mother's teenaged boyfriend, a one night stand) are significant somewhere to someone, and maybe even to you.<br /><br />What works for me in the novel is the power of some of the personalities to engage and pull you through your story so that you keep looking for more of them in later chapters, Sasha, the kleptomaniac the story begins with, for example.<br /><br />What doesn't work, or doesn't work as well, there are so many characters that you learn only bits and pieces about and that's it. It's unsatisfying to get a full chapter on Sasha's daughter and son but that's it.  This happens with lots of characters (Rob, who attempts to kill himself only to die in a swimming accident (or another suicide attempt?) has no history prior to this brief inclusion).  Obviously, Egan cannot provide complete biographies for every character, but why do some characters get extended treatment (like Dolly the PR lady for General's who have committed genocide?)?  Again, perhaps this is like life; some people's stories we know, others we don't and we don't get to pick which one?  But this is not a \\"good enough\\" justification to satisfy my frustration.<br /><br />Another weakness is Dolly's plot, which almost turned me off the book.  I wasn't immensely disturbed that she was helping murderers but what point did her story serve in developing the story as a whole. It was so unrealistic as to be bizarre in a novel that seems to be attempting to portray life as many of us experience it.  Her daughter, Lulu who is the most together if strangely aloof character in the novel is interesting, but her development does not seem to hinge on her mother's bizarre job (which she gets after she ends up scalding with oil a bunch of famous people in a celebrity event by an extremely unusual and contrived accident).<br /><br />But, I read through this middle piece seeking more pictures of Sasha and finding her story ultimately hopeful and promising if not completely satisfying. Other characters that we follow include her boss Bennie who discovered a famous band back in the early 80's I think, loses his job when he confronts the powers that be with the decline of the music industry in the age of contemporary music and revives a declining public in the future with the music of a decrepit friend we met years earlier at a central park concert. We also encounter his brother in law, Jules, who had attacked Kitty (a famous actress who pops up over and over and most importantly in a scene with the murderous general) and ended up in jail but is released to his sister's care to become a journalist. And we meet Lou an adulterous scummy producer (about how you'd imagine a scummy producer) who touches a variety of other character's lives in good and not so good ways. There are lots more characters than just these though, and this can be difficult to follow.<br /><br />The novel ends in the future where the internet and fear have changed our culture to one of virtual communication and the death of art but with the hope that time does not inevitably lead to destruction, just to growing up, if you are lucky, and, of course, death, regardless of your luck.
B000JQTWPO|4.0|This novel might be slow-going for modern readers, but it is easy to see why Collins was so popular in his day.  This 19th century novel adapts the 18th century epistolary novel to give the same multiple viewpoints and characterization through the characters' \\"own words\\" without the repetition of minor details in, say, Clarissa or Pamela (Richardson). Repetition is an essential feature of this type of novel, of course, but Collins maintains the balance between seeing events from different characters' perspectives and repeating exactly the same details (a feature that inspired Henry Fielding to parody the epistolary novel in his Shamela). Added to that, we have this novel's place in literary history as arguably (T.S. Eliot argued this) the first modern detective novel--this novel is then the last (or close to the last) pre-modern epistolary novel and the first modern detective novel.    Readers were shocked when the novel first came out by Collins' treatment of taboo subjects, ranging from a (gasp) suicide (and very subtle hints of lesbian attraction--too subtle to shock most of his contemporaries) to relatively subtle criticism of colonialism and racism; modern readers may be disappointed that the sinking sands never produce the body and are likely to see what Collins intended as a criticism of racism as, simply, racist. Collins was also a product of his times in terms of his views of women, and motivations based on the idea that women are entirely controlled by emotion and simply cannot understand finances may either confuse or upset modern readers, in terms of both believable motivation and the solution to the mystery.    Clearly, scholars of 18th and 19th century British literature should read this novel for its neglected place in literary history; today's \\"Common Reader\\" will need to adjust some expectations (the book is not meant to be read in an evening, for example) and be willing to \\"get into\\" the 19th century mindset (as opposed to enjoying modern novels set in a pseudo-19th century). The Moonstone is still not great literature compared to the \\"greats\\" of 19th century literary giants, but it will reward the modern reader willing to take this seminal detective novel on its own terms.    Besides, it is free (or nearly free) on Kindle (long out of copyright), so buying it is neither a financial investment nor a bookshelf-space commitment--and unlike some of the cheaper modern editions, you can adjust the font size so that the longish sentences do not tire the eye.
B004Z7AHTI|5.0|My grandsons have all the books in this series and couldn't wait to see the movie.  I love how this author keeps boys interest and gets them to read, and the movies follow the books pretty closely.  I have already pre-ordered the next book in the series and can't wait for the next movie.  They are so well done that adults can stand to watch them along with the kids and actually get quite a few chuckles.  Ah, memories of our own playground experiences!
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|I have long lamented the fact that vampires, one of the great antagonists of literature and mythology, have been so poorly translated to film.  Since 1922's Nosferatu, you can count the number of good vampire movies on one hand.  What's worse is how the portrayal of vampires has transformed from the embodiment of pure evil, to sympathetic vagabond, and now, sexy hero.<br /><br />In 1985, before this idiotic evolution, Fright Night was released in theaters.  The movie centered around a high school kid, Charlie, who comes to realize that a vampire, a fellow by the name of Jerry, has moved into the house next door.  When he tries to convince his girlfriend and best friend, they laugh at him.  But his insistence begins to worry them, so they enlist the help of Peter Vincent, an aging star of a recently canceled late night horror show, played by Roddy McDowall (Cornelius from Planet of the Apes).  His friends hope this vampire \\"expert\\" will prove to Charlie that their neighbor is no creature of the night. When Mr. Vincent realizes Jerry really is a bloodsucker, he eventually helps Charlie exterminate the creature.  Chris Sarandon (Prince Humperdinck of \\"The Princess Bride\\") gives a great performance that is both charming and malevolent as the evil neighbor.  The movie is a little dated, with 80s styles and music, but it's still among the best of the genre.  And it blends humor and horror as well any film ever has.<br /><br />The folks over at DreamWorks apparently felt this formula would work again in 2011. And since Hollywood is loathe to produce original material these days, a remake was in order.  This remake works largely because of timing.  In an era where vampires have become cute, misunderstood teen idols, audiences are ready for vampires who are just ruthless monsters, unencumbered by guilt or angst over their existence.<br /><br />The new Fright Night takes place in Las Vegas; an ideal place for a vampire to blend in because of its transient population that works all night and sleeps all day.  Overall, the remake has a superior cast.  Colin Farrell takes over as the not so friendly neighbor, Jerry.  Although I think he's a good actor, I have to say that I have long suffered from an acute case of Colin Farrell fatigue caused by his appearance in one out every three movies released from 2002-2006.  But Farrell is up to the challenge.  His Jerry is a sadistic and unrelenting killer.  He lacks the elegance and panache of Sarandon, but is every bit as charming.  Anton Yelchin (Chekov in the new Star Trek) plays Charlie, a kid who is trying hard to distance himself from his nerdy past and nerdy friends in order to win the affection of a pretty girl.  This time, Peter Vincent is a Vegas magician and narcissistic drunk hilariously brought to life by David Tennant (Doctor Who).  The movie has a few good scares and more than few good laughs.  If I was a movie critic, I would say it's \\"wickedly funny.\\"<br /><br />Fright Night moves fast, running from scene to scene, rarely slowing down for anything, which is too bad because its best scenes happen when the movie slows down to build the tension.  One such scene occurs when Jerry tries and tries to get a suspicious Charlie to invite him into the house.  Another when Charlie attempts to rescue one of Jerry's victims.  But the movie prefers a sprinters pace, so it can feel a little rushed at times.  There is also a few scenes with annoying CGI blood that's squirts at the camera intended for the 3D version.  But none of this keeps Fright Night from being a highly enjoyable date movie, quite possibly the most fun I've had at the theater this year.  And probably one of the best vampire movies ever, but that's not saying much..  Overall, the remake has a superior cast.  Colin Farrell takes over as the not so friendly neighbor, Jerry.

0393330435|1.0|I love books about computer history and culture. I really looked forward to this book but found it hugely disappointing, poorly written, repetitive, bragging etc. I never did understand why Woz and Jobs have become such cultural icons (I was there in the seventies/eighties and never thought too much of Apples products technically, pretty, but crap compared to the Z80 based machines I was brought up on) but I thought it would be interesting to read the history of the Apple 1 from the horses mouth (I never rated Job's accounts much as they are completely spun PR wise). I don't rate the MAC either but thoroughly enjoyed Andy Hertzfeld's book on the subject (Revolution in The Valley). In the end Woz has reinforced the notion that he was not a very brilliant engineer who just happened to be in the right place at the right time and partnered with the right guys.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is fantastic camera bag.  I was looking at a lot of other big name camera bags before stumbling on this one.  For my needs, it does what I want and more for around 1/3 the price of the other bags I was looking at.

Lots of compartments and pocketses on the bag.
0765365278|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is on of the most creative forces in Fantasy today and I have to praise him for it. 2011 and we are still strapped down by this notion of GRITTY IS GOOD and our supposedly gifted writing minds are left to play the same stories in the same medieval worlds over and over again. But not Brandon Sanderson, not \\"The Way of Kings\\".<br /><br />This novel could have been riddled with tropes, it could have started with a farmboy, two friends, and a wizard, and I would have forgiven it. Only it didn't. Plot = creative. World = creative. Magic = creative. Book itself = gorgeous. Paid for by Sanderson himself, as I understand it, \\"the Way of Kings\\" hardcover is worth the price alone, filled with illustrations and colored maps. If more novels looked like this instead of the paper-thin ready-to-fall-apart-on-the-second-read-through messes the publishers put out nowadays, I wouldn't have moved over to the Kindle.<br /><br />\\"The Way of Kings\\" and the Stormlight Archive will be the most influential fantasy novel/series since Martin added the Character-Killing-Wheel-o'-Death to the genre in 1996. Every page of it remembers...we're only bound by what we can't imagine. We can make any world we want. Authors don't even need to pay for CGI.  It marries the New Weird with the Traditional...that's an important step.<br /><br />While Sanderson's prose sometimes is mocked as awkward, here it proves workman-like and that's to its advantage, beautiful words would have only distracted from the world he builds before the reader. Instead we're left to enjoy and ponder over Roshar. Of Shadeplate and Shadeblades, of Stormlight and Windrunners, of Fabrials and Knights Radiant. We are plopped down on wind-swept wastelands where life only shows itself after the storm. We see unhindered shattered lands of running slave crews and assassins who seem to defy gravity.<br /><br />My only complaints have to do with the Shallan character taking so long to get going, the Kaladin flashbacks that don't seem to keep up with the rest of the novel and probably could have been cut, and...that no one seemed to teach Sanderson how to curse as a teenager. Storm you? Really?  Try: Stick it up your storm hole.  Better...<br /><br />More like this, fantasy authors, more like this. Four and a half stars and give the man a curve.the rest of the novel and probably could have been cut, and...that no one seemed to teach Sanderson how to curse as a teenager. Storm you? Really?

B0034G4OUO|2.0|Here's a random review of Faster released in 2010 it's hard to f  v  *  k up a revenge movie but this movie & M a s  ht it  t  y  but those movies did it.  George Tillman he directed Soul Food & Men Of Honor good movies but he wasn't right for this movie.  Stars The Rock as Driver, Nilly Bob Thorton as Cop, Oliver Jackson Cohen as Killer, Moon Bloodgood  as Marina & Maggie Grace as Lily. Story is this guy Driver has gotten out of prison he's going after the people that killed his brother. He goes into an office & kills this telemarketer. He goes & kills this guy who makes snuff films. Cop who was in on it hires a hit man named Killer you don't buy this guy for second he looks like he belongs in a chick flick. After he kills the snuff director he has a shoot out with Killer that reminds me of Kill Switch. Killer isn't doing this you know to help secure him & his girlfriends future he does as a hobby for 1 Godd  a  mn  dollar. Were introduced to Cops ex wife Marina & we have some over dramatic garbage about taking their son to his baseball game she threatens custody. Killer goes & marries Lily & he promises he will quit being a hit man. But he has to finish job Driver has an ex girlfriend it's over dramatic BS between them. Driver finds the guy who killed his brother you have a lame fight in the bathroom that reminds me of SF Legend Of Chun Li. Driver stabs this guy like 2 times he goes down. He asks Driver please tell my son I love him & I'm sorry. Driver calls that guys son & says something bad happened to your dad. WHAT NOOOOOO! I would've had him do this instead \\" No my job was to send you to he  'll  & I'm putting you there.\\" Here's a great piece of dialogue Cop is talking about what happened to the guy Driver stabbed Cop says it's a hunch he has his partner says \\"Yeah so did Quasimoto hsve a hunch & look where that got him. These 2 didn't have a good interaction. Driver still has the cell phone that guys son called & tells him he will come after The Rock has anok line he says \\"You do what you need to do. But you better be sure cause it's a long dark road. It turns out that guy is still alive Driver goes to the hospital finishes the job. Lame shoot out between Cop & Driver. You have a bad car chase with Driver & Killer. Driver has a clear shot for Killers head but starts shooting out his tires which allows Killer to shoot him in the neck & apparently it can be stiched right up. Driver is listening to a church station on the radio & 1 guy that was there when his brother was killed was this traveling preacher he asks for forgiveness & for whatever reason I buy it. Driver spares him. Killer confronts Driver & he says why don't you take me serious. Cause you belong in a chick flick. Cop says he was in it all along shoots Driver in the back of the head & pays Killer 1 dollar. Driver has a metal plate in his head so he got up & he kills cop & Driver goes off into the sunset. I thought this was a bad movie & it has the same problem that a lot of action  movies suffer from today they try & make them a \\"smart movie\\"  & they forget about the main reason you're watching THE ACTION! It's so pretentious it's not funny. George Tillman is a good director. They should've got an action director like Richard Donner, Renny Harlin or Mark L Lester. The Rock really doesn't do much. Billy Bob Thorton is there but he has nothing to do. Moon Bloodgood was awful. Oliver Jackson Cohenwill kill your love for action movies. Maggie Grace does nothing she did more in Taken. I'm glad this movie bombed. So I'll do more random reviews next.
B003Y5H5FQ|3.0|To remake the original Fright Night, widely considered a fan favorite by both horror fans and non-fans alike, is a difficult endeavor to accomplish.  The original was cleverly done, but had subject matter gravitas when good eventually met evil.  Fright Night redux, while a decent movie in its own right, fails in this regard, instead making a slicker, hipper version that takes advantage of contemporary actors who, for the most part, don't fill the shoes of their predecessors.  Both stories are essentially the same: A vampire named Jerry (Sarandon (1985)/Farrell (2011)) moves into a quiet neighborhood right next to Charley Brewster (Ragsdale/Yelchin), a teenage boy whose girlfriend is out of his league (Bearse/Poots), and best friend nicknamed Evil (Geoffreys/Mintze-Plasse) is the quintessential nerd.  Charley seeks the help of his friends, family, and famous vampire killer Peter Vincent (McDowall/Tennant) to stop Jerry from sucking the town dry.<br /><br />A character comparison between the two movies is unfair.  None of the actors save Imogen Poots is an upgrade to the former.  Colin Farrell broods and delivers lines slowly, but he lacks the sophistication of Chris Sarandon.  Mintze-Plasse can never shake off the McLovin moniker, and is a far cry from the oddity that was/is Stephen Geoffreys (who, judging from his IMDB page, now holds the camera for male-on-male adult films).  Yelchin is a fine young actor, but doesn't exude the spineless jellyfish that made Ragsdale's performance so perfect.  And to compare David Tennant to Roddy McDowall is downright offensive.  With that said, the film did have some upside.<br /><br />The story deviations allow for a sequel with bite, but without completely desecrating a film so many love.  A minor modification with one character's back story, a much quicker entry into the second act and subsequent tension (nearly no build up or character development, just straight into vampire huntin'), and an interesting extension to vampire lore without getting all glittery and sparkly, all help the remake's uniqueness.  Sort of.  While Sarandon may have been more sinister, there is no doubt that Farrell looks more dangerous.  Farrell's version of Jerry is one that doesn't look prissy, just stalking prey with the famed seduction skills of vampires; instead, lethally quick attacks and superhuman strength serve as killing instincts ferocious enough to get a National Geographic voiceover.  It may be cultural, or a sign of the times, but all the characters except McLovin are tougher, edgier, and can realistically be thrown into a confrontation.<br /><br />Naturally, the special effects were vastly improved.  Expected.  I'm not a big fan of 3D, and the add-ons for this film appear to be monetarily driven (read: minimal and underwhelming), so I am fairly certain the 2D version of this film will suffice.  Having said that, there is plenty of blood splatter, stakes through the heart, and human-to-vampire-to-human transformation to distance this film from the original.  Avoiding the cheesy bat from the original was a big upgrade.<br /><br />Overall I was entertained but not overwhelmed.  Much better than other blasphemous remakes that have been made in recent years (looking at you Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan), but still lacking originality or a true reason for the remake.ng all glittery and sparkly, all help the remake's uniqueness.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have been a true Star Wars fan for the majority of my life. I have been watching the original dvd's of the new trilogy as well as the VHS versions of the original trilogy for a very long time. I never bought the 2004 release of the original trilogy for the only reason of not having the money to do so, and was glad that I didn't when I watched all the changes that looked aweful in them, but now for this complete saga edition on blu-ray... Can't wait, bring it on.  I have done my research about what changes remain, what they added, and even what they didn't and let me tell you I may not be extremely happy about it, but its not as bad as the one star review guys are making it out to be. All of the CGI that was added to the original now does not look quite as out of place as it did on DVD as well as that NOOOOOOOOOOO they are all talking about being blaspheme, even though I do find it unnecessary, it does not ruin the scene. Honestly I might not have caught it had i not been listening for it. These changes are at the film makers discretion and if you are complaining about, and think that George Lucas, Creator of the epic Star Wars Galaxy and Co-Creator of Indiana Jones, will ever stop pushing the boundaries of technological advancement, which just for your information is how he created Star Wars in the first place, then just stop being a lucas fan and please stop tearing down these works of art!  For all you die hard Star Wars fans who have grown up watching Star Wars, Reading Star Wars, Playing Star Wars, and grabbing every possible chance to jump into the Galaxy Far Far Away I highly recomend this complete saga set... I have purchased a blu-ray player just for the even!  Thank You to everyone who reads this and decides that Star Wars has not been Ruined!

B004EPYZXK|3.0|The plot for this tedious film is simple enough: Apollo 17 is the last reported mission to the moon, but Apollo 18 actually happened clandestinely, under a Department of Defense emblazoned conspiracy umbrella.  The movie displays the \\"found footage.\\"<br /><br />First and foremost, I hated the filming techniques.  I get what they were attempting, but I wanted to hurt someone when it was finished.  Far too much choppy, shaky, grainy footage that jumped around like the camera was in a 10-foot blender.  The discontinuity between cuts reminded me of a security camera at the mall.  While it added an authentic feel to everything, it also distracted significantly.  The action is never seen.  The movement is cursory.  Then there's the great reveal that barely happened.  Implausible or not, the antagonist of a film needs to eventually be revealed and placed on display.  Otherwise the buildup is all for naught.  Imagine Jaws where all you see is the fin the entire movie.  At a certain point we need to see more than subliminal evil.<br /><br />The positives of this film are minimal.  The actors played the All-American, big man on campus role pretty well.  For NASA cream of the crop they were believable.  Sets were cramped, claustrophobic, and space-age, exactly what a space neophyte expects.  It's clear that the hall pass given by NASA was liberally used to cull source material for realistic set pieces and ideas.  A few jump scares are thrown in, but the timing may as well have been on a zoetrope they were so predictable.  Beyond that, there isn't much to like.<br /><br />The morose ending not only fills conspiracy theorists tin foil caps, but leaves a massive plot-hole that needs a backhoe to cover up.  Once you watch the film - if you want to waste money - you'll be asking why Apollo 18 ever occurred.  I'm not only talking about the mission in the film, but the film itself.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why would you ignore the vast majority of fans who have zero desire to own this chopped up, redone chunk of garbage? Come on Mr. Lucas, don't you hear the people? We don't want CGI. We want models, and puppets, and everything that made Star Wars great. Have you learned nothing??/
0938045695|5.0|Terrific book. I'm new to training almost exclusively with kettlebells and this book spelled it all out, from form and technique to programming. I'm a huge fan!
B004FOA84A|4.0|Had a lot of fun playing but was way too short, I need more games like it. If any one knows of some let me know.
B000068MFS|1.0|Why do I watch it when the enormous amount of outright stupidity makes me crazy.  (Name any scene with Sarah in it, and it is maddeningly stupid).  The psycho chick lead - is a therapist who proves the hypothesis that only truly sick people enter that profession.  (I don't happen to believe this).  She is nuts.  She completely screws her best friend, and, sadly, her friend doesn't walk out of her life forever.    The supporting actors are wonderful.  Cusak is fine, but you have to loathe his character for falling for psycho-woman -- and why not?  She is thin and she has a British accent.    Why did they do this to us?  Was the original script okay, but got skewered by a demented series of editors, producers and directors?    I don't even want to donate this film to a thrift store because the unfortunate person who buys it would probably find me and sue me.  Bleah!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The properly restored, original theatrical versions of Star Wars (1977), Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return Of The Jedi (1983) will be the next things I purchase from Lucasfilm.  I didn't purchase the 1997 altered versions, the 2004 altered versions, or the 2006 altered versions - and I have absolutely ZERO interest in these current abominations.  This set does not contain the films that captured the public's imagination. The poorly done, non-anamorphic, DVD copies of the 1993 laserdiscs that were released as bonus discs with the 2006 alterations were a slap in the face to the fans who put George where he is today.  I've never seen a situation where the director digs his heels in a this level and goes out of his way to make sure the fans get only something they've repeatedly said they don't want.  It is truly an ego out of control.
B005COO1X6|1.0|It's like Stephen King wrote this on break.  I understand it is a single which doesn't leave much for character and plot development.  Just know this is no Langoliers.  The begining has promise but it quickly goes down hill from there.  The ending leaves much to be desired.  Frankly, it seems like the whole thing was set up to get you to read the snippet from \\"11/23/63\\" (a new book - which was almost as long as the story itself).  I couldn't bring myself to read that as I just needed to archive this single as soon as possible and move on with my life.
0060936223|2.0|This is undoubtedly a better book than two stars, but that's all I can give it, because that how the book was for me.  Not being an artiste like Patti, I have a hard time getting excited about her scores of references to Rimbaud and other artists in ways that assumes the reader must know everything about them.  Perhaps I could have learned something about them if Smith would have explained in all those references a little more about why or how Rimbaud et al related to what she was writing about.  A somewhat comparable memoir is Keith Richards' \\"Life\\" (and yes Patti drops his name here too along with dozens of other musicians, poets, photographers, et al).  Keith writes in detail about making music with other celebrities but not with a lot of jargon and in ways that fans can understand what he's talking about and if he drops a musician's name he explains what the connection is to that particular reference.  Patti tends to just mention the names for the sake of mentioning the names.  It's not so much that she's trying to prove how cool she is, but she just seems to identify so many things with her heroes without explaining why.  And that for me is the problem with most of the book.  Everything is headlines, there are few stories and they are short and similar and not particularly connected.  There's no overall story beyond that she has a long-term on-off devoted relationship to Robert.  But I don't really get a sense of who Patti is because she's mostly an observer of all the stuff around her.  She's more the reporter than the main character of her memoir.  It's all about the cool places she went and the cool people she talked with.  But few of these people last more than a few paragraphs and then it's on to the next celebrity sighting and quote.  And she describes them in ideal terms most of the time, seemingly reluctant to criticize anyone.  As the book progresses Patti is devoted to her art, but doesn't seemed to be focused on making any particular kind and the same goes for Mapplethorpe.  They seem more wannabe artists trying to mix together stuff they find and photos into 3D collages. Kitsch, but artistic kitsch.  I do get a sense of who he is, but I'm not impressed.  He's mostly a deadbeat who she lets off the hook for getting any kind of real job because Robert is an artist and a regular job wouldn't fit his personality.  Meanwhile it isn't till they've been together about three years before he seriously tries to SELL any of all the art he's making.  And the same for Patti, but at least she maintains a real job in a bookstore.  Smith certainly knows how to turn a phrase and her poetry background comes in handy in that sense, but too many of the phrases seem unconnected and hard to understand in context.  They seem to come out of nowhere like poetry sometimes does.  She has a great remembrance of physical detail, I'm guessing because she kept extensive journals at the time and that works well for her in terms of memory, but works against her in terms of a story arc as the book reads like a collection of journal pages.  So it's a somewhat engaging read that never seems to go anywhere.  She writes in an interesting way, there's just no plot, no story.  The characters are described well physically, but the conversations are snippets so we don't learn much about them.  And the characters just come and go.  Besides Robert, they don't last very long.  The extended ending is done nicely and gives a better sense of who these two people were.  So National Book Award material, I think not.  Do the people who give these awards actually read the whole books or do they just go by number of celebrity sightings and artistic cachet?
1594744769|5.0|This book was very good. I was instantly pulled in with the title. It reminds me of the Percy Jackson series. It leaves off on kind of a cliffhanger. Definitely recommend to fantasy fans.
0307887960|5.0|Great Book,  It has changed the way I eat. I am a nutritional cleansing coach and this has given me more tools. The very low fat, high protein first week was easy and I lost 5lbs Dr. Dukan had several small tips for loosing weight I had not heard before.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|It received low rotten tommatoes but it made more money than the first one. I mean adults might not liked it but kids loved it.
B0054N73EY|4.0|I pre-ordered this cd in early August and I received it in the mail the day of it's release. I might be a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but this review certainly isn't an ungrounded and unwaivering praise. I enjoy the majority of songs from \\"I'm With You\\", but I did find a couple to be too slow and repetitive. Small problems aside, this album is certainly worth the money, as it will provide many hours of listening entertainment. This album is one of the most accesible, yet still energetic releases I've ever heard. I like how the band blends their classic funk rock sound with a mellower, pop-oriented sound on this album; it's an interesting twist and I appreciate the progression of their musical style.     The album kicks off with the strange yet beautiful track \\"Monarchy of Roses\\". With the inclusion of this track I could tell from the very beginning that this album was going to be something wonderful. This song really sets the mood for what's to follow in the album, 13 more incredibly diverse songs- ranging from the high energy tracks \\"factory of faith\\", \\"Look around\\" and \\"Happiness Loves Company\\", to the slow ballads \\"Brendan's Death Song\\" and \\"Police Station\\".    My top picks from the album are \\"Factory of Faith\\", \\"Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie\\", and \\"Happiness Loves Company\\". If you're a fan of the Chili Peppers then you should certainly get this addition! If you're interested in the band then I would definitely recommend this album, it's the same great energy with a new musical sound and direction. Maybe you'll find yourself singing along to it in the car like me!   :)
1439175640|5.0|This is a great purchase! I absolutely love it!! Every recipe I bake is always a hit and there are so many different recipes to choose from! Definitely recommend this cookbook!
0446679089|5.0|This is my first DeMille read and it won't be my last. Apart from a slow section in the middle, Plum Island is a terrific, exciting and action packed read filled with suspense, horror and humour. Loved it.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|I reccomend this seller and this product.  The movie was awesome, it arrived on time and in the condition stated.  I would deffinetly purchase more items from this seller.
B004OR1XGK|5.0|This book highlights the knowledge of the ages of software development in one concise text. It does not explain everything you ever wanted to know about every aspect of SD, but it does go into good discussion about most, if not all of the topics. For instance, the section on design patterns is a few pages long at best, but it provides a good overview of the most common patterns, and references to the seminal works in the area. Other sections of note cover design, cohesion, abstraction, integration, project management, and team management. But there are many more and the entire book is worth the read. If you are a software developer and haven't read this book, I highly recommend that you do so.
B00005JPAO|5.0|The Queen is another first rate performance by Helen Mirren. This is an engaging production that keeps your interest start to finish. This is a story that looks at the institution of the monarchy in England today. The story and Ms. Mirren's performance shows the conflict arising with a class of people who are not used to being told \\"no\\" and yet have no real power. The movie doesn't make any judgements or conclusions but leaves it to the viewer to draw their own conclusions. A very refreshing approach.
0823013626|4.0|Donna's polymer clay creations are exquisite!!!  Her work could be in a fine arts show.  Due to her sense of design and creativity you will learn from this book and get stimulated to create out of the \\"norm\\".  I was disappointed in the photography.  I will say the lighting is not as professional as it should be to justify Donna's work.  There are hot spots in many of the shots.  I'd still recommend this book because of Donna's artistic skill.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|Yoko Ono pays loving tribute to her husband by having \\"Double Fantasy\\" digitally remastered to better hear John's voice. Result: \\"Double Fantasy\\" went from being arguably the best ex-Beatle album to being undoubtedly the best.  The 1980 original comes packaged with the 2010 remastery - a double dutch treat from Yoko and Capitol Records. The original recalls those heady days of comeback for the Lennons that \\"ended\\" in tragedy (although \\"Watching the Wheels\\" shows John wonderfully at peace with the celebrity thing. \\"Just Like Starting Over\\" is about personal relationships, not the music business). The new CD is consolation that it's not the end in the overall sense - John will always be with us and his family will find novel ways to connect us more with him.  John lives on in Yoko - if you don't believe me see the picture of the two together in John's Last Interview story in Rolling Stone (published 2010). Look at the two sets of eyes and you'll know the soul is one.  I was reading the book of Nehemiah recently (quite useful and contemporary for anyone interesting in looking at the dimensions of today's Israel/Palestine situation). Any way, Chapter 6 talks about the Valley of Ono. The remastered \\"Double Fantasy\\" should be called the Mountain of Ono. It's a beautiful and lasting gift to her soul mate and their listening public. Thank you, Dear Yoko.
B0043EV774|3.0|I have nothing bad to say about the seller at all, the item arrived on time, even sooner than expected.  The price was amazing for a 3D movie, actually was half the price best buy was selling it for.  The only thing negative I have to say is that the movie was not really my type of movie, which is not the sellers fault what so ever.  So all in all I'd say the seller is reliable and very fair with pricing.
B000022TSW|3.0|I'm a latecoming fan of South Park.  I remember watching a little bit of it online back in 1998 and while I found the image of Santa Claus and Jesus having a knife fight hilarious, I thought the show was a little too full of profanity and gross out humor.<br /><br />Flash forward to 2011, I thankfully discovered the true genius of the series and have seen all but a handful.  I'm a long time Simpsons' fan but I think South Park is right up there in being funny and satirical...and has the added virtue of being evenhanded in its political humor (the Simpsons sometimes gets annoying liberal/left in its plotlines).<br /><br />So I watched this movie with high expectations, but it just wasn't the laugh fest I expected.  I think South Park has gotten far more edgier and topical since this movie was made, and I think maybe that's the reason that the movie fell a little flat for me.<br /><br />But it's still a great series.
B005COO1X6|3.0|If you like SK, you know you'll read it but honestly time would be better spent reading one of his classics - Shining, Salems Lot,  The Stand, It. I have read all of his books and there simply is not enough time here to even care about the characters and what is happening to them or even why it is happening.  Good for a taste but not even close to a full meal.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|After using this app a couple of times,  my confidence level grew to the point that my phone is now my primary alarm clock.  I love the auto incremental volume feature that wakes me gently,  but insistently.  Nicely done!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Performs just as described on my Samsung Charge. Great tool for finding the strongest signal when out and about. Also good as a tool to test placement of my home wifi router.
B004YJMQCS|3.0|Product arrived on time and in condition stated.  Although the movie was not as good as I expected I can not say anything wrong about the seller.  I reccomend purchasing from this seller if they have what you are looking for.  Items ship fast and in condition stated.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm sorry, but all the people moaning and groaning and giving this movie 1 star are being ridiculous. You people do realize that you don't have to buy these movies, right? You can continue to watch your VHS tapes or Laserdiscs. Hell, George Lucas even released unaltered versions of the films in DVD for all the purists out there. What more do you want? Why not just watch the unaltered DVD's and be happy? And don't complain about picture quality, because in 1977 Star Wars was shown on grainy projectors.     You people seem to be forgetting that George is not remaking a bunch of old movies, he is making, as he has explained countless times to deaf ears, a 12 hour epic. It would be simply impossible for him to make three prequels without making some changes to the originals. For example, if Lucas did not include a Dug in Jabba's palace, you might be forced to wonder where all the prequel aliens went. Lucas is creating symmetry and continuity between the six movies. This is the reason for the dreaded \\"Noooooooo\\"; it's a filmmakers technique for alluding to an earlier point in the saga. Also, where are all the \\"purists\\" when it comes to improvements to the OT; why does nobody complain about the removal of the Emperor's old lady/baboon face in ESB? Or the added shots of the Millennium Falcon taking off from Mos Eisley? Or the added X-Wings on the attack on the Death Star? There are just as many good changes as bad ones, IMO, and the new changes just make the six movies work together better. IF, at a later date, Lucas decides to release a historic preservation disc, which I am sure he will, all of you 1 star people will look pretty foolish.
B00000JLWW|2.0|The realism aspect of this film - the collision with the iceberg, the growing panic, the lifeboats half-empty, etc were very well done. In this, it seems to follow the 1950s black and white movie, 'A Night To Remember'.    But I thought the romance aspect of the movie was the biggest lot of trash I have ever seen. The truth is that a woman of that social class would not have looked sideways as a boy (and I emphasize 'boy') from the lower ranks. Also no woman of that social setting would have been well-versed in theories of psychology as our heroinne was.    The most memorable thing about this movie was the Celine Dionne song.
B0001GMIOE|4.0|The battery seems to work better than original with a longer life than the battery that came with my Canon 5D. The true test will be over time when the battery life degrades with age.
B0054N73EY|4.0|Funky.    Like most people have said, there is a Frusciante-shaped hole but Klinghoffer is not bad by any means. Josh is a bit timid throughout the album but definitely shines in a few songs. This album is heavily influenced by African beats. It's a new RHCP but regardless, this is my favorite band of all time.    Highlights include-  Monarchy of the Roses: heavier song with nice distortion.  Factory of Faith: My favorite on the album. The groove is uncanny. Lyrically, this is an awesome throwback yet refined type RHCP song- \\"Crack your whip, she's confessing from the hip...\\"  Brendan's Death Song: Important track. If you don't know, the band's good friend Brendan Mullen passed away and once the band heard the news, they immediately started playing. This is the result.. a ballad in tribute.  Goodbye Hooray- What an amazing bass solo.    Definitely worth $10, would have loved to hear Frusciante in it though.
0307387178|5.0|My daughter needed this title as  required by her school.  I couldn't find the book in any store, so I was very pleased to find it through Amazon.  The book was in good condition as promised.  I thought it would have arrived sooner since I picked a vendor in the same state as my shipping address.  I was a little disappointed that it didn' t come sooner, but it was within the listed time frame.  As for the book itself, my daughter found it somewhat repetitve and boring after the first half.
B004H83IG4|3.0|I love Ryan Gosling but found this movie hard to navigate.  It jumps from the present to the past with no warning and it is quite confusing.  Some may find it interesting, but I did not.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|My goodness, you people really are completely out of control.  As William Shatner observed in the classic SNL sketch where he addressed an audience of Star Trek fans, \\"Get a life.  Move out of your parent's basements.  Go on a date...\\"  I have seen every Star Wars films on the date of their release (usually the first showing) and I love the movies.  The fact is that the changes made to the films over the years are changes that their creator wanted made.  They are his movies, and he has the right to change them if he see's fit.  While I am more in Spielberg's camp (he has said that there will be no digital tinkering with any more of his films) if Lucas wants to make changes, it is his right as an artist.  Frankly, I really liked the improved special effects in the original trilogy, effects that he would have used originally if he had the money and the technology.  I don't like that Han doesn't shoot first, but really, I don't stay up nights worrying about it either.  I have an actual life, so, you know, that's what I concentrate on.  I find that doing the nasty makes up for my misgivings about Lucas tampering with his own work.  I AM interested to see how the films look and sound.  If they don't look and sound great, then I will certainly join the chorus of \\"boos\\", but as far as I know, not a single person has actually seen or heard the blu-rays.  Peace all.
B0051CSI0G|3.0|It wasn't bad - it's about a 2.5 star movie, I had to choose between 2 and 3 stars because of Amazon.  It was good, very mild/tame for a horror flick, however it's more zombie than vampire - no 'blood sucking' not that I needed to see it. But at the end, some of the usual annoying common sense issues kicked in (possible spoilers, so stop here if you haven't seen it).    *** some spoiler info below on the common sense issues ***  1. The head of the cult - they tie him to a tree, should have just killed him right then as you knew he would come back to get them - this was too typical and they could/should have done something better  2. they went north during winter - if the vamps are cold blooded like they said, how can the now vamp cult leader still move around so fast as a cold blooded creature - same with when they were in the car junkyard and a bunch of them attacked  3. when they were in the bus, why not only go to the bathroom in pairs (one guy gets killed going solo outside the bus)  4. they said Eden didn't have vamps but had cannibals - but the movie ends with them arriving at Eden so unless that's Part 2, they left out all of that.  5. the boy almost gets killed because he's outside the car and it's locked and the weapons are inside - IT'S A CONVERTIBLE, but he never tried to cut it open to get the weapons.
0451228375|2.0|I have two main qualms with this book. First, I couldn't tell if this was historical fiction or historical porn. The sexuality of this book is graphic, unrealistic, and obtrusive. When I read all the complaining about the sexuality in this book, I thought the reviewers were a bunch of whiney prudes. I was wrong. Every girl in the story is a porn star in the making--constantly thinking about sex, aggressively pursuing it, and never getting enough of it. Can't Follett allow a little romance without telling us that the girl is \\"so wet\\" or the guy is having an erection?     Secondly, a good historical fiction should not only present accurate historical facts and setting, but also the thinking, values, and beliefs of that period. Rather than doing the hard work of creating characters of the age, characters that help us to connect, understand, and sympathize (though not necessarily agree) with the people of the past, modern authors generally (and probably unconsciously) opt to create characters who simply think like us but happen to live in a pre-modern society. Such writing looses the soul of historical fiction. The only characters developed with any depth in World Without End are modern people in Middle Age clothing.    Follett is a gifted writer, and the story really did have potential. But the obtrusive sexuality and the lack of any historical soul in the characters makes this a long and forgettable read. On the other hand, if you want to know how to make a book popular, this isn't a bad guide. Put in lots of sex and make the characters just like us. Hollywood has done it for years.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|With so few good rock albums anymore, this is a breath of fresh air.  Perfect \\"Foo\\" album...great variety of tunes, strings and drums are incredible, and Dave's vocals are always tremendous.  The \\"guests\\" on the album really added some depth to their respective songs as well.  Can't say enough good things about it...it's an absolutely awesome album that my wife, 2 young sons and I really enjoy.
B004A8ZX28|3.0|Interesting film starring Liam Neeson. While the premise is not new, the story is engrossing and the Berlin background is wonderful.
030788743X|4.0|FYI: Copy for review provided by Netgalley.    Please Insert Coin to Begin.    Premise: In the very near future, life is pretty bad. Most people spend their time (and their money) on the OASIS, an enormous virtual system that has replaced the internet, schools, many workplaces, and more. But the late creator of the OASIS left a secret, an easter egg, in the program somewhere. Whoever finds it is entitled to the late billionaire's entire fortune. There are corporations that spend all their time and energy in the search for the egg, but there are also lots of freelancers. Freelancers like Wade Watts, high school kid and gunter (egg-hunter). But no one has made progress on the riddle of the Egg in years, that is, until now...    This is the most charmingly adorable dystopia I think I've ever read, and I mean all the words in that sentence. Halliday, the man behind the OASIS and the hunt for the Egg, was a child of the 80's, and layered the pop culture references of his childhood into some environments in the virtual world and made them the key to the elaborate game that he set up for his aspiring heirs. This means that much of the book is kids in the future studying and becoming obsessed with the 80's, which is pretty entertaining. Obscure video games, movies, D&D, it's all in there. (Well, not too much in the way of books, which is odd for a book, but whatever.)      The book itself is structured like a classic 80's film: a group of kids from different backgrounds are in search of treasure, the obsessions of young people are extremely useful, the antagonist is an evil corporation whose motives and actions will probably be kind of silly if you think about them too hard. It skims over uncomfortable aspects of the future, touches on subjects without exploring them; again, much like many 80's movies.    It's a super-fun read, not serious science-fiction by any definition, but it's not trying to be. There were a few aspects to the plot that I found too easy or pat, but thetone was generally light enough (even when the subject matter got dark) that I could overlook them.    The puzzles were fun, the sense of teen adventure was strong, and I couldn't put it down once I got into it, devouring it in two marathon sessions. The ending was simplistic, but I'm still giving it high marks.
1400052181|5.0|I love this book, and I've long been fascinated by genetics and biology.  It appealed to me initially for the science of it, but what stays with me is the disrespect and dishonesty with which the very people we most need to trust, treated Henrietta and her handicapped daughter.  Medicine is built on the backs of people in pain, and sometimes finding the way to help means causing agony, but this family was treated in ways they didn't understand, as less than human at times, and even now, when we should know better, when her genes have served the world, her family can not afford good medical treatment.  it tells you to use the medical system when you must, but never leave someone you love in the hands of a Dr. without someone who loves them being there to speak up when they are too sick to stand up for themselves.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I've seen multiple versions of Jane Eyre and this one is by far the best.  I loved every minute of it.  Masterpiece Theatre always does a great job.
B000UBMWG4|2.0|This was so disappointing! I don't know if there's something wrong with Blu Ray 5 disc Bladerunner that I got, but the 'Final-Cut' disc (which I watched first); the 'time to die' scene i.e. with Batty releasing the dove etc; one of the flaws that the final cut was meant to correct was the blue, earling morning sky that the dove flies up into - which is in stark contrast to the smog laden, techno, industrial, retro-fitted builidngs / L.A. scenery in the rest of the film. However, in this final cut; it's exactly the same i.e. the dove flying up into the out of contrast, early morning clear blue sky i.e. exactly the same as in the original 1982 / voice-over, theatrical version and the 1992 Directors Cut!!! And the scene where Deckard's at Abdul Ben Hassan's investigating the snake; some of the dialogue's still out of sync, even after the final cut's makers went to the trouble of getting in Harrison Fords son, Ben Ford to do green screen shots so his lips could be composited to make it look Harrison Ford's lips / mouth etc. And the makers of the final cut went to the trouble of fixing the fact that, if you look closely enough at the earlier versions i.e. where Zhora's running out of Taffy Lewis's bar; she's apparently wearing stilleto's and then not wearing them in the next shot (where she bursts out on to the street), but this wasn't noticable to me anyway (and beleive me I've watched Bladerunner countless times). In other words; it was such a minor detail and yet in the final cut, they apparently fixed this and yet seem to neglect much more obvious flaws e.g. the dove flying up into the clear blue sky... even though they made a special, new landscape shot for this i.e. with the dove flying up into a rumbling, dark cloud / smog laden sky; past retro-fitted, futuristic, multi-layered, instrustrial, techno buildings (like it should've been), but for some reason, this wasn't in the Blu Ray final cut that I received!     And the final cut omits the cool music at the opening credits roll and the other touch ups are barely noticeable anyway. Also, the final cut put's in this crappy, supposedly suspensful music at the showdown i.e. where Batty's chasing Deckard in the Bradbury apartments; I much prefered how it was in the theatrical and directors cuts. OK, the final cut's got some extra / additional footage which hardcore Bladerunner fans have known about, but never actually seen on screen i.e. in the downtown / 'fourth sector', L.A. street scenes e.g. the dancers in the tubes etc., but apart from that, the final cut's not that great. Also, the 'Workprint' i.e. disc 5, turned out to be just another copy of the final cut!
B0031R5K72|5.0|This book was amazing.  It kept me turning the pages and burning the midnight oil.  It was beautifully written; the use of description and personification enhanced the readers pleasure and displayed the story vividly in the reader's mind. It certainly gave food for thought. What a truly amazing writer.
B004YTGRMI|5.0|If you prefer rockin' R.E.M. then look no further than this, their best record!  The bonus tracks on this package aren't incredibly amazing but are still worth having.  The album itself is fantastic and hearing the demos is pretty cool too.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I was surprised when this 2011 version of Jane Eyre popped up in movie theaters.  The 2006 BBC version of Jane Eyre with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson was, in my mind, the perfect  adaption.  It reminded me of when Pride and Prejudice was released on the big screen with Kiera Knightly as Elizabeth.  I dragged myself to see it knowing full well I'd be disappointed.  So I resisted seeing this film but the reviews were so good that I finally watched it once it came out on DVD.  I will say the actors were good and it isn't nearly as bad as the big screen version of Pride and Prejudice, but it was still a let down.  Once you get the perfect version fixed in your mind, any other attempts to watch another adaption of a classic are a waste of time.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Everyone should know the reason why everyone is giving this a one star review and of course if I could I would give it negative marks as this is just awful. This Saga did not need any changes as Mr. Lucas should of left this be. I was really excited for this to come to Blu-ray though now I cancelled my order and will not be purchasing this at all. It is awful to support his new changes/views and will protest that no one should purchase this horrible edition of the saga. I would rather watch my nice classic THX versions on VHS.
B005B19UPE|4.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" taught me about an awful tragedy which happened during WWII. It's a work of fiction based on historical facts. I can't wait to see the movie.
0525422943|4.0|Adam Wilde is living the dream. His band is about to start the biggest tour of their career, their albums have gone triple platinum and he's half of the hottest celebrity couple around. The interviews, videos and recording sessions should be the icing on the cake, but for the \\"Wilde Man\\" they're torture. No matter how many pills he takes or cigarettes he smokes, the dream still feels like a nightmare. No one understands why the man who has it all acts like he's in hell. He knows what went wrong, but there's nothing Adam can do to make himself enjoy the life he always thought he wanted. Because it was a dream they made together, and it doesn't make him happy without her. But one day when fate intervenes, Adam finally finds the answers he has been searching for.    Even though \\"Where She Went\\" is a follow-up to Mia's story in \\"If I Stay\\", I think Adam's tale will be just as enjoyable for those who haven't read the first book. Gayle Forman has an incredible ability to write characters that almost leap off the page they feel so real.    Adam's story unfolds in both real-time and through flashbacks, but the two work together seamlessly to fill in the details of the past three years without ever felling jumpy or hard to follow. I really have no complaints with Where She Went. The characters are wonderful, the pacing is perfect and the story answers all the questions that readers are left with after \\"If I Stay\\". The only reason I gave this book one less star than \\"If I Stay\\" was that it didn't quite pack the emotional punch that Mia's side of the story did. But I think that's a result of reading these two books back-to-back, rather than there being anything lacking in \\"Where She Went\\".    I absolutely loved this book (and it's predecessor) and will be recommending it to every one of my fellow book lovers. \\"Where She Went\\" is the type of story that makes me love reading - an emotional ride with great characters that really stays with you. I can't wait to read more from Gayle Forman.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Just adding another voice of protest over the further alterations to what was once the greatest movie trilogy of all time (or at least my favorite).  It boggles my mind why George Lucas makes unnecessary, even damaging, changes, but ignores flaws in the films that really do need fixing.  The added \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOs\\" to the climactic scene of ROTJ are just laughable.  LAUGHABLE!!  As someone on the Internet said, \\"Star Wars has had so many tweaks, it looks like Joan Rivers now.\\"  Enough is enough.  Voting with my wallet.  NOT getting this release.  Maybe I'll look for a used set someday, for the bonus features, but even that might be problematic: If no one buys this set in the first place, there won't BE any used ones for sale!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Soulful, smokey sweet Hugh Laurie has produced a lasting legacy with this southern blues album.  Worth waiting for its release, I'm now eagerly anticipating a second volume.  Every song is beautifully executed, lyrics and music, by professionals.  Laurie should plunge headlong into this new adventure of life.
0142403873|4.0|My kids really liked the book the first time but don't ever want to read it at bedtime since the gruffalo is a little scary for a 4 and 5 year old (at least my boys!).
B00005N5RM|4.0|Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith star in this 1988 sci-fi/horror  remake of the 1958 film. A deadly slime substance from space   terrorizes a small town. I watched this growing up and always   thought it was creepy. This dvd has good picture and sound,   but only trailers. If you like good 80's sci-fi/horror, get this.
B001O1O71C|4.0|Without wanting to give anything away, I'll just say -- this story has a message.      For those who need 100% logic in everything they read, you're really missing out.  This is a story that is less about the nitty gritty details and more about the message.  Just allow the story to guide you and you'll understand in the end.  What's that old saying about trees and a forest....?
B0055SWM08|4.0|I enjoy a good puzzle game to pass the time.  The graphic style is very tranquil and polished.  Gameplay is simple but very well executed.  I missed this one as a free app but have no regrets about this purchase.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I grew up loving these movies but am a far cry from a \\"fanboy\\" or \\"purist\\".  However, you don't need to be Star Wars-obsessed to see that most of the changes that GL has made have created awkward, disjointed and distracting scenes that disrupt the viewing experience.  I would have no problem with changes if they were improvements but many are detrimental and disappointing.
B001B6PBBK|4.0|This movie was great. Like the title says it totally takes a while to get moving, but once it does it gets hectic and you really start feeling for the characters. Acting-wise, things weren't bad, but I wasn't blown away either. Brittany stole the show as my favorite because she was quite charming a lot of the time with her dialogue but could be serious when called for too (R.I.P.). However, I could actually relate to Matthew Rhys' character's withdrawn-from-reality state of mind. His view and approach to relationships hit too close to home. I was rooting for him the whole time since he was the main underdog.<br /><br />All in all, I'm totally glad I used up an hour and a half of my life to watch this crazy movie. It was kinda dark, but not completely. I won't really give anything away because I want you to form your own opinions. I think it's worth watching though!<br /><br />4.2 stars.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I just got my Kindle a few months ago and have been reading a lot of the lower priced (or free), self-published authors lately.  While some of them have been decent, reading this story reminded me why I love and miss the work of Stephen King.  There's just nobody quite like him.  Anywhere.  Not even close.    Not wanting to give anything away but as other reviewers -- who are obviously familiar with his body of work -- have stated, this is typical Stephen King.  His stories make you smile, look over your shoulder, cringe, laugh, wrinkle your forehead, and say, \\"Are you serious?\\" -- all in the same story.    If you must have logic and tidy endings then perhaps this isn't the story for you.  As for me, I appreciated the story; it suited me just fine.
0545259088|5.0|Isabel's father plots to wipe out the wolves and Sam and Isabel search for ways to save the pack as Cole races to find a cure for Grace. The romances--between Sam and Grace, and between Cole and Isabel are still central to the story. Sam and Grace struggle with her unpredictable transformations as Cole and Isabel struggle with their icy and warring personalities. The ending is satisfying, but will leave you yearning for more.
B00008WT5C|5.0|How good is it? I know that I will buy from Amazon again because they make it easy and as far as time goes it arrived here well ahead of the expected time of arrival!!!    I am looking forward placing my next order soon!
B004LWZW24|1.0|I had serious issues with how lackadaisical the parents were in the beginning of the movie, which took away my fright. I was so annoyed with them, I couldn't get into the scarier scenes.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I can watch it a hundred times and never get bored :))) It's so unbelievably funny :P For once I am glad they didn't go with the epic version of the story!
1450400957|4.0|While this book works on the assumption that you are working out at home with limited equipment it goes into great detail how to exercies different muscles/muscle groups.    While I don't agree with some of the assumptions it contains many insights which I found very useful and have not heard from other sources.    Also a good reference because of the excellent drawings.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This box set is a major disappointment in so many ways.     First, Lucas never even announced the changes. I would have been very angry and shocked as I sat and watched these films, never even aware that this is NOT the set I had intended to purchase. It amazes me that he would put these out without any details concerning the changes. It's bad enough that I had to buy the Special Editions. Thank God it was leaked on the internet before the release.     Second, it is expected that these type of major releases be all inclusive. Every major box set have included all versions of the films, including the original theatrical release (except Lord of The Rings - which angered those fans). Avator - 3 versions, Apocalypse Now - 2 versions, Blade Runner - 5 versions, Terminator 2 - 2 versions, Aliens - 2 versions of each film.     Third, you really have to ask what is wrong with Lucas. After all, Star Wars original theatrical releases made him a billionaire. His fans responded to them and made him a billionaire. The original versions obviously elicit a strong emotional response to them. Quite simply he is denying his fans on purpose. He really is just slapping them in the face. What's worse is he doesn't care at all. What harm would there be in releasing the original cuts? He really is being stubborn and his reasoning is absurd. There isn't a single studio or director who acts this way. No movie in history has \\"disappeared\\" only be to replaced again and again with different versions each time. It's important to understand that Star Wars isn't just a movie. It's a world wide cultural phenomenon that was influential in dozens of areas. To erase it is to erase history.     Fourth, at this point we don't know how many changes there are. There could be even bigger, worse changes than what we are aware of. I've read that Yoda has been replaced by CGI in Empire and Jedi. Also, there is some speculation that the transfer itself may not be as good as expected. In any case, I want a full review of the films.     Fifth, yes, I suppose he can make as many changes as he wants; he owns the films; it's his vison. It doesn't mean he should or that it's right. He himself spoke to Congress on this very issue. It's all over the internet now. He WAS very much against going into classic films and altering them and changing the original vision of the director (it should be pointed out that he did NOT direct Empire or Jedi). Just ask yourself how you would feel if any classics that you liked were altered - Ten Commandments, Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia, It's A Wonderful Life, Willy Wonka and many others.     Sadly for the fans, for the next generation, for historians, and for professors of film, religion and psychology the original versions will be gone.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game reminds me of Myst and other point and click adventure/puzzle games. It's a good game but it was really short. You can probably finish the game in about 30 - 45 mins. Hopefully they will consider creating more like this. This game worked really well on my Asus Transformer.
B000002KKC|5.0|TUSK occupies a unique place in the soap opera that became Fleetwood Mac.  Often compared (deservedly so) to The Beatles \\"white album\\", TUSK was definitely different from the predecessor RUMOURS, one of the biggest selling albums of all time.  Most audiophiles my age, discovered Fleetwood Mac during college by word of mouth and we played Kiln House, Bare Trees, Mystery To Me and other cult gems for each other.  When the revamped group came out with FLEETWOOD MAC we were just thrown further to the moon!  I mean, who in their right mind could not be melted to a pool of dew by the sultry voice of the new singer Stevie, or be blown away by the new guitarist Lindsey, and who did not sit up and notice for the very first time that Christine's voice had actually gotten better with age, much more velvety with wider range and softer edges?  So we all lapped up FLEETWOOD MAC and then RUMOURS and couldn't wait for the next album.  An ambitious one to boot.  The retail price we stood in line for was about 16 smackers, a punch of money in those days!  The album had weight to it, a double LP, and was reported to be the most expensive produced album to date.  So when we slavered to get it on the turntable and listened, many were rather put off by a third or more of the songs.  Had Lindsey Buckingham chosen to clean out his closet and just surrender dregs to the project, while Stevie and Christine obviously put a hell of a lot of heart and soul into their recordings?  The thing was all mixed up too.  You would have a beautiful soft lamenting love song, a deep and passionate ballad, and then a thumping belligerent sturm und drang minimalist...thing!  Thank God some of us kept our heads.  This album took a while to fully appreciate.  In fact it took about 5 years to fully appreciate (for me).  You see, Lindsey Buckingham was way ahead of the public.  Today's music audience will listen to this and not hesitate to instantly figure out where this all came from and can probably get instant gratification from it.<br /><br />Traditionally, the birth of \\"punk rock\\" is attributed to the 1963 breakout of a garage band from Portland, called The Kingsmen, who's first hit single Louie Louie would smash the charts not once in '63, but a second time in '66, about the same time as another \\"punk\\" original, The Kinks were climbing out of obscurity.  The Troggs would soon follow.  These were the mainstays for the coming movement of true Punk which would be pioneered in the 70's by The Ramones (and The Clash on the other side of the pond).  This is where Lindsey had his ear tuned during the making of TUSK.  In hindsight it is easy to see, but for Fleetwood Mac fans in 1979, most of us were descended from meat-eating 60's rock and blues, and Lindsey had just offered us a plate of fish bones.  So it took some time and some understanding to start learning how to digest and eventually come to enjoy those fish bones!<br /><br />And so now, on to the music.  Instead of occupying a large amount of space to the songs, something I always try to avoid if possible especially when an album has been reviewed 170 times, I would like to just address the music from the perspective of The Players.<br /><br />Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, the two names who are indeed the meaning of Fleetwood Mac, have been pounding the rhythm of Mac albums since the formation by the heart of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers.  Guitarists and singers have driven this soap opera since it began its run, but the rhythm section of Fleetwood Mac is the heartbeat of the group, the mainstay, the force that remains the name.  There is certainly nothing lacking in their department on TUSK, in fact the reverse is true.  Some of the most beautiful songs on this album demonstrate the finest bass and drums ever delivered by this unit.  Over & Over, Beautiful Child, and Brown Eyes immediately come to mind.  Fleetwood and Mac aged like fine wine, full of finesse, grace, character, and boldness.  Even the brash Buckingham compositions, like The Ledge, and Not That Funny, might initially put you off, but listen carefully to that timing, to the actual lack of distortion where you imagined it was.  The bass and drums on TUSK are as pure and perfect as always, and the production on this album is at its all-time highest.<br /><br />Christine: she made her debut with Fleetwood Mac drawing the cover art and performing un-credited backing vocals and keys on Kiln House in 1970 (in 1969 she was un-credited piano as Christine Perfect on Then Play On when she had been asked to join the group and to marry John McVie).  She really debuted her fine voice on songs like Show Me A Smile (FUTURE GAMES), and Spare Me A Little Of Your Love (BARE TREES) before she took off with outstanding vocals on PENGUIN, MYSTERY TO ME, and HEROS ARE HARD TO FIND.  Then something happened.  Stevie and Lindsey joined the soap opera and Christine's voice underwent magical uplifting like a cross-your-heart bra.  Over My Head, Warm Ways, Songbird, Oh Daddy, these songs and others from the previous two albums raised her vocal chords into the heavenly choirs.  TUSK took it again to another level.  Especially the songs Over & Over, Never Make Me Cry, Honey Hi, Brown Eyes, and Never Forget, not only do they demonstrate a voice developing into smooth velvet but the complex layers of composition reveal a songstress in her prime.  And for those of you who thought that Lindsey was accompanying her on Brown Eyes by imitating old Fleetwood Mac ethereal guitars, a word of note if you have not read any of the expose bios written in the last 20 years:  that beautiful haunting guitar that lilts and weaves around her voice and keys in Brown Eyes actually is Peter Green who showed up at the recording of the song, unannounced, and was promptly invited in by Christine and Lindsey (who humbly gave up his guitar to the co-founder of the Mac).<br /><br />Stevie!  One of the most unique and satisfying voices in rock, and although her vocals have not aged well since, Stevie's voice from BUCKINGHAM NICKS through FLEETWOOD MAC GREATEST HITS has been purely phenomenal.  Storms and Beautiful Child on TUSK are perhaps her greatest masterpieces, deeply introspective and lusty they rival Rhiannon and Dreams in their art.  If you have GREATEST HITS and do not wish to pay the premium price for the bonus disc material, satisfy your collection by buying the single disc version of this album.  Sara is on this album in its edited radio single form, whereas on GREATEST HITS you will still find the full length version of the song.  Sisters Of The Moon is a hard-edged sequel of sorts to Rhiannon, another of her witchy songs with wailing vocals.<br /><br />Finally, let's talk about Lindsey and all the \\"trouble\\" he caused for this album.  Certainly the record company blamed Buckingham for the poor sales (relative to RUMOURS) of this album but there were indeed extenuating circumstances.  Although John McVie called TUSK a \\"work of three solo artists\\", Mick Fleetwood hailed it as his favorite and their best work.  Fleetwood blames the poor sales on RKO radio who played the album in its entirety over and over again prior to the albums official release.  This allowed for mass home taping at the time, when America was in a recession and the double LP carried a list price of $15.98 to boot.  Lindsey's minimalist recordings at the time were not immediately friendly to many Mac fans but clearly half of those songs were, yes experimental but, complex layers of vocals and wall of sound.  That's All For Everyone, That's Enough For Me, I Know I'm Not Wrong, and Walk A Thin Line were very early attempts at new wave soundboards.  Today those songs play like any \\"classics\\" from the 80's and even 90's, they are artsy, elaborate, and honest in production.  The song Tusk was the true high-water mark for the album.  Lindsey created a work of art on par with anything John Lennon tried with The Beatles.  It has not aged, it is still a triumph of musical experimentation and should be heralded as a musical masterpiece.  Only three songs can be compared to punk in reality:  The Ledge, What Makes You Think You're The One, and Not That Funny.  Given the time they were composed and recorded, the production value and the craft involved, I would say that Lindsey was just a tad bit early in offering them up to us.  That always seems to be the trademark of a true artistic genius.  Compare what he did to Vincent Van Gogh, or Jim Morrison for perspective.  It is very hard to be ahead of your time.  We can easily judge with hindsight, but in 1979, Lindsey took a thrashing.<br /><br />TUSK is a real work of art, painted by some serious artists on a canvas that is timeless.  Enjoy it now in the new millennium if you haven't before now.  If you have not yet replaced your old vinyl and have forgotten how much you really did love this album, don't let it continue to sit on the shelf.e from BUCKINGHAM NICKS through FLEETWOOD MAC GREATEST HITS has been purely phenomenal.

0553801473|5.0|After a long wait, Martin delivered! I've read his latest in one long haul and it was more than worth it. If you're a fan of the Song of Ice and Fire series, this one will not disappoint. Tyrion is back, small man, big mouth, suspense and surprise on The Wall for Jon and Dany is not getting it any easier. Martin ends with a couple of cliffhangers (like: say WHAT???) so I really, REALLY hope he will not wait another seven years for the next novel to deliver!
B004RSCWZ2|3.0|The Tedeschi Truck Band is an assembly of some very talented men and woman. There is nothing wrong with this album, but there is nothing compelling. Its a nice album. Not a great album.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I feel ashamed it's taken me this long to review an app that has saved my a** so many times. droid x and works perfectly...though I did get my version in the android market nearly a year ago now.   I've used it not only to make scans, but also to take pictures and convert them to a pdf in the style of a little story line. Not only incredibly useful, but tons of fun.   You can't best the ease, accuracy, and convenience of this app. First one I tried and got so lucky!
B000002UV1|4.0|Great Cover, great album. The first one with  John Fruscante and he really rocks out here. I would have dumped a few songs to keep the flow more even but we can do that ourselves now. Enjoy!
B004HO6I4M|3.0|Well, sometimes the studios have a hit and other times...  In the case of \\"Rio - the Movie\\" there are great digital graphics (wonderful detail and use of color), lots of scenes taken from the actual location (!), but a story line that was just - lame. Perhaps the writers were aiming at a very young audience... But even with a very young audience the Story Line is Everything.  Let's put it this way:  My Grandson likes to watch Finding Nemo occasionally.  He hasn't asked to see Rio after the first time.
B00000099Y|4.0|TOOL is a great band, don't get me wrong, but I wish they would get with the program and release all their albums in MP3 format because I don't want to spend a bunch of money on CD's when I can just download it onto my computer and be done with it, that is my only complaint.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|I absolutely love this album....I'm a Rhi Rhi fan for life. There is not one song on here that i did not like.
B000002MTR|4.0|This is a good album. Just bought it after many years and love what Dava Navarro does on guitar. Very inspired work. If you like the Peppers, get this one and enjoy.
B004G600A4|5.0|A musical in the great tradition of the Disney Studios.  The basic story line of the German fairy tale Rapunzel is taken for a warp-speed ride by one of the more successful Disney efforts - the story line is true to the original, the digital action is creative and beautifully done and the action is non-stop.  I sent a copy to my Grandson as a birthday present and he loved it. I also added it to my digital library collection...
0345529057|5.0|If you buy these separately it will cost twice as much, this is a great series of books at a really good price. I'm happy with it!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|\\"Nooo Nooo !!\\" - yelps Darth Vader, blinking ewoks (shudder). Another rumored difference is Obi-Wan Kenobi's first introduction in the original \\"Star Wars\\" movie. Obi first appears as a hooded figure walking oddly over a hill, using the force to simulate a Krayt Dragon cry to scare Tusken Raiders away from Luke Skywalker. In the revised version, the cry is different, carrying a longer, shriller tone.<br /><br />What changes are next Mr. Lukey(yeah I know its lucas) ? more new CGI additions, maybe 4D w/ smell-a-vision? Why not add that video of Darth Vader telling ppl to buy Star Wars Blu-ray on amazon into the movie. This is laughable, but what a complete waste of a re-release double dip. I wish the govt. would step in and take control of the originals (as a part of American film history preservation) since he wants to keep making these super duper deluxe special editions. I cancelled my order. I can wait longer for the galaxy far far away...and to think we were all excited for this...lol<br /><br />PS: The first 1977 star wars movie (which is now episode 4) is simply Star Wars, not \\"a new hope\\"
B00540G3G6|5.0|This is a great movie and will not knock the stars for that. People that take stars off for price need to re-think. You are rating the product and NOT the sale. With that being said, the price here is HORRIBLE. Almost $10 cheaper on wally world online. Come on Amazon!!!!
0312323867|4.0|I'm sure I'm not alone in that I hated Darcy for the first half of the book. I enjoyed the story, but I could NOT stand her. But the story of her personal growth was what this book was all about, and that was most definitely not lost on me.<br /><br />Marcus was a character I didn't care for in either this book or the predecessor (Something Borrowed) and I  still didn't care for him in this book. In fact, I wasn't surprised in the slightest by his actions and his attitude. (And I felt sad for Dex all over again for having had a friend like him, wondering how they were ever friends in the first place!)<br /><br />I loved this book. LOVED IT. But, I have one complaint. I wish there had been more Dex and Rachel. I understand why they were left out of most of the book, but I really wish there had been more of them. Since we grew to love them so much in the last book.<br /><br />Something Blue was a great follow up to Something Borrowed, and I loved ever minute of the book (even if I didn't always love teh characters)
B004G6009U|5.0|I've been longing to see the movie when it was released. Bought 1 when it was on sale, and waited for it to arrive. Wait some more and it never arrived. Amazon was kind enough to send another copy early August and received it by early September. I really appreciate it.    The movie is an enjoyable adventure and my kids really love it. We have seen it for a couple of times now and they have not grown tired of it. This movie is highly recommended.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This is a fabulous book.  The stories are riveting, the commentary is thoughtful, the science is well-documented.  Very highly recommended.
0452289963|5.0|This is definitely a must read. I love this book and would recommend this to all of my close family and friends, and my co-workers. I actually plan to give a few copies away as Christmas gifts this year! It is truly a life changing read especially for those who are ready and open to receiving this awakening and a new state of consciousness. It really open my eyes to how I can and should live a more stress free and happier life. I totally view life itself differently now. I just have to TRY and keep these teachings fresh and new in mind on a daily basis.
0857680986|5.0|One of the finest books ever produced on the subject of figure drawing. This book should be in every artists library. Mr. Loomis covers areas of study that many drawing books fail at. His easy to understand writing and diagrams are exceptional. Just the chapter on figure perspective is worth the price. For the artist knowledge and application is the key to a successful creative career. Wisdom has become hard to find in our schools today and accrued knowledge seems to be fading fast. This book has a vast amount of information that will, with application, help any artist to develop their skills to a degree that would otherwise take years of searching fruitlessly. Buy this book, read it thoroughly several times and then draw every diagram until you fully understand the concepts and you will improve. Two more of this great teachers books are going to be reprinted soon and they are just as helpful to artistic development.  Mr. Loomis is a master artist and teacher. His contributions to the art world should be in every school library. These are great books and they should never again be ignored. Keep them in print.
0307595862|1.0|The snowman concept sounded interesting and it was with great anticipation that I started this but it never delivered more than a boring read. It is just over the top but not in a good way. The killer's identity is not hard to figure out if you pay the slighest bit of attention.It really could have been great but even reading it during a hurricane could not save the dismal writing and plot development.No more of this author for me.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|There is a reason Star Wars was so popular.  And these endless attempts to \\"improve\\" it are not it.  Please stop tinkering with this classic.  It was an extremely good series of THREE movies.  Please stop destroying them.  I will never purchase this, although I am a huge Star Wars fan--meaning, a huge fan of the first three movies.
1439102724|4.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend who listened to the audio version and felt the music was a vital part of the story; I feel the story is an important one and am glad the author is unafraid to plunge into difficult topics; I enjoy her writing, but did not feel the music was vital to the story; the book and CD arrived on time and in good condition
B004LWZVZC|4.0|Robert Redford has created a movie that addresses an important moment in the american history.  This film is about the assassination of US President Abraham Lincoln and the subsequent trial of people involved in the plot.  One of the individuals on trial is Mary Surrat who was used as a bait by the government to catch her son who was involve with the conspirators.  She is defended by a young attorney Frederick Aiken whose youth, inexperience and strong drive for justice are impressive.  He is true to his calling and convictions in spite of the fact that his principles will not help him make friends, get social acceptance in high circles and will even destroy the relationship with a woman he loves.<br /><br />Although movie drags at times, I found topic fascinating.  Redford is exploring the meaning of justice, the extent of motherly love, constitutional difference between military and civil court.  In many ways, the assassination of President Lincoln has helped shape America as a nation and this film is an important history lesson on how that was accomplished.
B0053F042G|5.0|Source Code tells the story of our military using quantum physics to solve a crime that hasn't happened yet, but is linked to a disaster that has happened in our immediate past.  In order to catch the terrorist, a soldier is sent back in time to occupy the body of one of the passengers killed on a communtor train to Chicago.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays the soldier choosen because of special circumstances to go back in time, and in only eight minutes, find the the bomb and who planted it.<br /><br />The plot line resembles Ground Hog Day, one of my favorite movies, where the soldier must learn from his previous mistakes, until finally he completes his task and is allowed to stop going back in time.  Source Code gives us more science to go with, than Ground Hog, which makes it quite believeable.  The acting by Gyllenhaal is outstanding.  We see him go from a scared and confused man, to one who grasps his environment enough to learn to control it.  Vera Farmiga, who plays his communications link during the experiment, shows her conflicted emotions with the greatest of subtley, a real joy to watch.<br /><br />Lots of suspense, and lots for your brain to chew on, which is what I love about science fiction.  Are we traveling towards this new reality as delve into the mystery of quantum physics?  Do the decisions we don't act on played out on some cosmic stage in another reality?  Just consider all the high-tech gear we marveled at in Star Trek and consider how much of it we use today, and Source Code seems like it could well be our future.

In the first 500 pages we have not gotten anywhere.  Nothing looks to be close to resolution.  Characters are either struting in place or wandering aimlessly.<br /><br />I can put up with Dave Weber's data dumps because you know that something will happen by the end of the book.  After the previous book I had my doubts we would get any answers.  Now I am almost sure that we will be wondering we this book was written when we finished it.

B002VPE1PW|5.0|I bought this to hold and protect my Acer AspireOne netbook (10.1\\") while transporting it back and forth to university classes. It fit the netbook perfectly and provides a good amount of protection from drops, scrapes, and other damage. The black exterior is quite discreet, and the orange interior was quite a nice surprise. Leaving the netbook in the case, by putting the white interior straps around the corners of the screen and base, kept the computer off of the desks and dissection tables and kept the computer clean.     This case will be too big for tablets, but is the perfect size for 10.1\\" netbooks. Do not buy this expecting to stuff accessories (charging cables, USB devices) into the case, because there is no room once the netbook is in there. Amazon makes a slightly larger case with handles and an outside pocket that is more capable of carrying accessories in addition to the computer[[ASIN:B002VPE1Q6 AmazonBasics Netbook Bag with Handle, Fits 7- to 10-Inch Netbooks, iPad, HP Touchpad (Black)]], but this product is designed to hold only the computer.    The packaging is a big plus, as you only need a sharp object to pierce/slice the sticker holding the box closed. Inside the box is the product and the warranty card. No frustrating excess plastic or vacuum/shrink wrapped packaging or cardboard. Perfect. This is how everything should be sold and shipped.
B000IKQMFO|4.0|An entertaining look at the upstairs and downstairs worlds of the well to do in England, with excellent performances by all.

B003UESJHO|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Mark Walberg but this movie is OVER the top. Incredible and heartwarming film with great performances by a talented cast. Christian Bale is \\"off the hook\\" as Dick Englund.... This is one film you MUST see. The most incredible thing in my opinion is that 12 reviewers gave it one star...That is UNBELIEVEABLE....see it, see it ,see it and did I say see it? One of my top 10 movies EVER......next to Godfather, Rocky, slumdog millionaire, do the right thing,Terms of endearment, color purple, Ben hur, Avatar.......just a note, the scene with Dicky and his mom in the car is a tear jerker.....

Watch as she tries to land a rich man and get breast implants by utilizing school funds.  Throughout the movie, she learns a valuable lesson about superficiality. I'd definitely recommend this one.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I downloaded the Kindle version of a workbook for a class ONLY because the class would start in a few days.

I so enjoy the freedom to go back and forth between the text and the workbook on my Android phone OR my little Notepad/laptop.  Thank you for making it so flexible and user friendly!

0440238609|5.0|This is a true fantasy series. However unlike many fantasy series it rejects the spiritual in a lot of ways and the protagonists are in conflict with the representatives of the spiritual rather than being subtly backed by \\"godlike forces\\". I read a lot of fantasy and I find it helpful to place this series in terms of maturity, content and detail, between Harry Potter and Narnia (on the low end) and Lord of the Rings and Wheel of Time on the high end. Note: That is not a ranking of enjoy-ability. The books are highly enjoyable and one of my favorite series of all time.
6305212112|3.0|`Fried Green Tomatoes' is the kind of manipulative chick flick that reminds one of earlier efforts with large female casts such as `Steel Magnolias'.  Strong women remaining strong and or learning to be stronger thanks to the strong women around them.  There is no testosterone here, for this is an estrogen lovefest that completely consumes itself with its solitary purpose of female empowerment.  I made a comment on a recent review (I think it was for `Whale Rider') where I talked about how I'm not opposed to `Girl Power' but that I have an aversion to girl power movies because they are never done right (or rarely done right).<br /><br />I can't say that `Fried Green Tomatoes' is any different.  It just dumbs down everything far too much.  I understand that women have to fight in a world dominated by men, but I'd rather see a realistic depiction and not one bogged down so heavily by opposition that every scene really seems like a `struggle'.<br /><br />It takes away the films integrity.<br /><br />Another sore spot is the acting.  I love me some Kathy Bates, but she's always been a spotty actress.  Here she is far too light for my liking, coming off a tad insincere in her approach, but then again, the film itself is far too light for its own good.  Mary Stuart Masterson is kind of awful here.  I can't decide, between her and Mary-Louise Parker, who botches the accent more (or who overdoes it the worst).  At least with Parker, she has the actorly bravado to carry her character's arc, and she really excels in the second half of the film.  Jessica Tandy is easily the best part of the film, so jovial and exciting and effervescent (no wonder she got that Oscar nomination).<br /><br />The film is told in flashbacks while Tandy's character, not residing in a nursing home, tells Bates' character Evelyn about her childhood friends, Idgie and Ruth.  Both women are bonded over the loss of Idgie's brother Buddy.  The girls, growing up in the 20's and 30's, live a hard life full of death, oppression and abuse, but they come together to strengthen each other and `fight for what they believe in'.<br /><br />`Fried Green Tomatoes' has tonal issues.  The film has scenes too heavy for the light-hearted delivery, and yet the light-hearted delivery can be so beautiful that you almost wish the heavier scenes weren't there.  I think that Robert Redford captured a more acceptable tone in his `A River Run's Through It' to following year, taking a similar place and time and giving it a more realistic approach.  Jon Avnet's direction just clashes and makes for an uneven film.<br /><br />Yet, much like `Steel Magnolias' (which was also uneven), `Fried Green Tomatoes' is certainly watchable.se, but they come together to strengthen each other and `fight for what they believe in'.    `Fried Green Tomatoes' has tonal issues.

0470932139|5.0|Helene Dujardin's book is full of useful information, presented in a very personal and delightful way. I love that she really focuses on natural light, but at the same time, gives you good techniques for using additional lighting when needed. Her photographs are inspiring!
B000GUJZ4G|4.0|Before I get into this, I'll start by saying that `Point Break' is ridiculously entertaining.  It is very much in the same vein as `The Fast and the Furious' or even Ben Affleck's latest directorial effort, `The Town'; both films apparently drawing major influences from Kathryn Bigelow's cult classic.  With that said; `Point Break' has some serious flaws (namely, the horrendous acting) that take it down a notch.  It is still well worth watching, and I'd totally watch it again, but I can't say that this is great.<br /><br />I mean, Keanu Reeves, Gary Busey AND John C. McGinley in the SAME MOVIE.  Talk about the trifecta of horrendously bad acting.  They even share scenes together.  When the three of them unite it's like the world stops spinning and all the heads of those listening to them force emotion explode in unison.<br /><br />Like, totally dude!<br /><br />It's sad when the most reputable actor in your cast is Patrick Swayze, a mediocre talent at best.  In fact, this film's `acting' is saved by the little known Lori Petty, who just sizzles as the spunky Tyler.<br /><br />Back to the film itself.<br /><br />`Point Break' centers on Johnny Utah, a young cop recently assigned to the Bank Robbery division of his LAPD.  Soon he gets sucked in, by his partner Pappas, to go undercover as a surfer to catch a gang of notorious bank robbers called The Ex-Presidents.  They've robbed a ton of banks in three years' time and have never been caught.  They're too smart for that.  Pappas is convinced they have to be surfers thanks to one of the culprit's tan-lines and some wax he found scuffed on a bank counter.  Johnny now has to acquaint himself with the surfer crowd, which comes easier than he expected thanks to a hot young thing and her ex-beau.  Johnny soon finds himself getting caught up in the mentality of the surfer crowd, that of a spiritual connection to the sea, but as he closes in on The Ex-Presidents he becomes torn between his old life and the new one he just started.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is one of those actors who tries way to hard.  I love how Petty's character Tyler calls Johnny (Reeves) out for looking so serious all the time.  That is Keanu in a nutshell.  He looks so serious, but he sounds so goofy.  He can't deliver his lines with any real conviction.  It doesn't help that he's saddled with some terrible dialog (\\"You have to go down!\\").  Busey has been reduced to a joke in recent years, but apparently he was a decent actor in the 80's, or at least he was that one time when he received an Academy award nomination for playing Buddy Holly.  Outside of that, he rarely receives much praise.  In fact, the best thing he does in this film is punch John C. McGinley in the face (something I've wanted to do for years) so, yay for him.  McGinley is a horrific actor who has one gimmick he overuses to no end.  It was funny the first three times I watched `Scrubs'.  It's not funny anymore and yet he can't stop doing in.  I didn't realize he did it with every character he plays.  Those long running monologues with minor vocal fluctuations without taking a single breath just aren't effective; at all.<br /><br />UGH, but poor acting choices can't take away from the adrenaline rush that comes from this slickly directed film; and the brilliant cinematography (equal parts sun, sand, water and hair) make for a captivating ride.  Like I said, I will TOTALLY watch this again but to say that this is a great movie would be a stretch.actors who tries way to hard.

1416562605|5.0|This novel reflects realities not simply in India but in many developping countries where development aid gets stolen due to corruption and power structure based on bribing and corruption. But could you imagine something similar happening in USA? I was fascinated by the dystopian vision of Democracy Society by J. Christmas. But one thing is sure democracy is not an end point and reversals are always possible.one always hopes that people learn from mistakes and try to construct better future make smart choices but sometimes its just the opposite, sometimes people make the wrong choices and if you look around the world today one can see so many nation-states where due to wrong choices people are suffering. Anyway the book is just great and really realistic
6305744793|5.0|My first attempt at watching this movie failed.  I actually turned it off; I was so bored.  Sadly, this was largely due to the fact that I never watched the show, ever, and so I wasn't really in the mood and didn't know what I was in for.  After watching the wildly entertaining `Addams Family Values', I decided to check this one out a second time.  It flowed much easier for me, to where I could actually make it through the entire film, and I found myself rather liking what I was seeing.  I've seen this one (as well as `Values', which has grown on me even more) a few times now, and I must admit that both films hold up ridiculously well, largely thanks to the incredible cast.  From Anjelica Huston to Christina Ricci, this film glows thanks to their darkly satirical performances.  Some have noted that the plot is dumb, but I'd say less dumb and more predictable (it just seems lazy), but the dumbness is something to be expected and even relished in a film like this because the vibe soaks in with the atmosphere to present a curiously `special' take on something that is familiar.  I'm just glad that Tim Burton didn't direct this one too, although the early 90's was his heyday and so maybe he would have done something special with this.  Alas, `The Addams Family' is a total joy, and one that I recommend wholeheartedly.  Give it a try, maybe two or three, but once it sinks in it sinks it for good.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|As a parent I recommend this movie for every teenager's library.  With as many struggles as kids face today, this is a heartwarming movie that serves as a great encouragement for when someone thinks about giving up or going through something that seems too tough.  There are few movies out that I would recommend whole-heartily, this is one of them.  I brought three movies for my teenager, niece & nephew.

1594744769|3.0|Have to give the book three stars for the effort Riggs invested plotting this doozy.  I am not a fan of the vintage pictures of creepy looking kids and would not have given this book to my kids because the photos are the kind that will get them scared in bed at night.      What I liked best was the Grandpa and he was not around for most of the story.  He had spirit.  Otherwise I agree with other commenters that some of the story seemed to be forced to tie in with the photos and that the first person voice doesn't seem like that of a 16 year old, especially some of the descriptive passages.    The story felt like a rush of details, but I didn't care about these kids.  And if there was supposed to be romantic tension between Jacob and Emma I didn't feel it.  I felt as if maybe the editors suggested throwing that in to attract more girl readers, but it didn't work, they should have kept them as friends.  Also, they gave away a major clue as to who the bad guy would be way before the reveal.  It was kind of obvious!      However, I think Riggs did a good job creating a wild fantasy world at the orphanage, it's just not a place I want to think about again.  I felt manipulated by the ending.  I guess everyone is looking for the next Harry Potter goldmine and it's more important to set up the sequel than wrap up the story we've invested in.  Write the next book about the Grandpa's early days, that would be fun.
0307577589|5.0|I drive alot and this series of books kept me interested and wanting more.  The characters are so interesting and have so many layers.  The twists and the irony that Stieg Larsson's unexpected death before he could write more is unfortunate.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|There exists a lot of issues with this.    1- No original cuts. Fans deserve the OPTION to watch it as they want. I am not going to lie a few of the enhancements I like BUT I would rather just see them the way I watched them on VHS right before the 1997 re-releases. I am only 22 and I hate the special edition changes.     2- There are errors and lighting corrections that haven't been fixed. This is just not a very good cut even if you don't care about the Theatrical versions.     3- One of the bonus discs include 7+ hours of extras while 2 of the discs include 3.5 hours of footage seems like they are skimping on the extras.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|\\"Ready Player One\\" is fun, especially if you grew up in the 1980s or at least have a working knowledge of the popular culture of that day.  The book is overflowing with references to the era, and for good reason: several of those references end up being important plot points.    Many of them, however, are extremely forced.  The main character listens to \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" while he's flying around?  Great!  What does that add, exactly?  Cory Doctorow and Wil Wheaton are the President and VP of The Internet in 2044?  Fantastic!  That ought to get your book mentioned on their websites.  The list goes on and on.      One thing that bothers me about futuristic tales is that sometimes the author won't \\"fill in the gaps.\\"  It's pretty hard to believe that none of the characters found anything redeeming about entertainment from around the year 2000 on.  At least make up some titles from the 2020s or something.    Finally, I must agree with some of the other reviewers that the writing is pretty substandard for a book that will ostensibly be placed on several \\"Best Of\\" lists by the end of the year.  The dialogue is forced and unrealistic, and the narrative style is far too expository.  Also, beware of McGuffins, at least one major Deus ex Machina, and preachy monologues just as the tension is building for the final act.  I feel that this book should be classified as \\"Young Adult Fiction.\\"  Not only is that a better description of the reading level, but I can see teenagers being captivated by the themes of escapism more than adults.    Having said all of that, the plot did capture my imagination as well as my attention.  I thought about giving four stars, but there were just too many glaring problems to do so.  I have recommended the book to my geeky friends, but probably won't bring it up to the ones that are more interested in literature.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I ordered The Pacific after being blown away by Band of Brothers, and I was not disappointed. Based on several books by veterans of the Pacific war, this series takes a more personal look at the lives of several veterans, and three in particular. John Basilone was a true hero in every sense of the word. I already knew his story, but it didn't lessen the emotional impact of his death on Iwo Jim and its effect on his bride of seven months and his proud family. I liked Robert Leckie. He was a bit of a rebel, yet he was introspective and had a kind soul. The war nearly drove him crazy, yet he survived and went on to a productive civilian life. Eugene Sledge had trouble coping after the war, and it haunted him for years afterward.    If anything, the series left me thinking how horrible war was and about the mental damage it left on the veterans. My own father fought as a Marine in the Pacific and, like several of these veterans, never really talked about the war. When the 50th anniversary of the battle of Tinian was mentioned in the news, I asked my father if he was there. He said he was, then asked me why I was bringing up such horrible memories. I never asked him about the war again.
B0044RZ8W0|5.0|Rose cant be with Dimitri, and her best friend Mason, who also loved her, died (I miss him!) Things cant possibly get any worse...only they do.<br /><br />After all the craziness that happened during winter break, its finally spring and Rose is that much closer to graduation and being Lissa's guardian alongside Dimitri. But weird things have been going on, like, IDK, Rose seeing Mason's ghost on campus. Actually, she's been having all these weird flashback/vision type things that may be related to her bond with Lissa. Rose is trying to deal with this, her attraction to Dimitri, and Adrian's persistent flirting when BAM!!! Strigoi attack the Academy! It was all very intense and quite actiony...which I like in a book. I think Rose is just an amazing heroine! And can I just say that even though Christian and Rose dislike each other, they make a great team! The things they do when they work together are just awesome!<br /><br />I love books that can provoke great emotions in me. For example, I was awwwwwing and grinning like a crazy person *cough* Dimitri and Rose *cough* in some parts, and Adrian was always making me laugh...I really do like him ;) Though those emotions aren't always happy ones: during other parts I was crying like there was no tomorrow. [spoiler]<br /><br />The ending...man, it was just depressing! I really hope things between Rose and Dimitri get fixed somehow because I really think she deserves a happily ever after.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Spoiler Alert!<br /><br />[spoiler]--The mother trucking Strigoi who attacked the school turned Dimitri in one of them! I swear, I think my jaw hit the floor with surprise while i had a river of tears running down my face! And the tears kept coming when Mason (or his ghost, I should say) left for good :(
0553801473|4.0|I think that many of the reviews and ratings have been way too harsh for this book.  There are things that people wanted to happen in this book that did not come to pass - yet.  This especially holds true for Dany, who just seems to have no clue whatsoever what she wants to do and who she wants to be.  I definitely feel the pain here as I never really identified well with the settings and characters on this side of RR's world.<br /><br />But despite the Dany flat tire (and a few other ones...), all of the chapters are great reads.  I've seen it said that this book sets the pieces into play for the next few books and I can't agree more.  Characters are in place to finish this insanely good series and the best part of this is that I don't have a clue just how this big thing is going to end!<br /><br />I thought A Feast For Crows was a pretty average book - this one is better though because you get to focus on better characters.  It makes me crave the next book which is all I can ask for.<br /><br />4/5 stars
0142410373|5.0|I recently rediscovered Matilda after having read it in grade school.  It is still a wonderful book even though years have gone by!      Matilda overcomes adversity in her own home and at school.  She strives for appreciation, respect, and doing the right thing.  This is a heart warming tale combining values with an excellent story.  Something most school children could learn to love and benefit from at the same time.

B0007O38XU|5.0|I was very happy with my purchase. Received it very quickly and it is in great condition. I can't wait to watch this movie again. Classic.

030788743X|3.0|I have a limited book budget, so I try to choose books carefully.  I'm always grateful when Amazon publishes previews that give you an idea of what the book is like before buying.  There are a lot of positive reviews for this book, but before buying I recommend reading the preview to see if the book is your cup of tea.  It was not mine.  I read about fifty pages and the book started to bore me.  This book is not nearly as good as Walter Jon William's book [[ASIN:0316003166 This Is Not a Game]].  The book is packed with nostalgia from the 1980s and 1990s.  I've actually played some of the games mentioned in the book and I am a software engineer.  But this was still not enough of a foundation for me to find the book interesting.  Tastes differ, of course.  So read the preview.
B003R4ZMNQ|1.0|There is an online ad for HAWAII FIVE-0 SEASON ONE DVD set.  It's got 5 discs, all kinds of extras.  This amazon description[[ASIN:B003R4ZMNQ Hawaii Five-0: The First Season]] has one disc and no extras listed.  I'm not going to chance it, and cancelled my 'pre-order'.  A show like this had to have a lot of extras, I couldn't imagine why none were listed.  But my purchase will be elsewhere, I'll tell you that.
0307474275|1.0|This is the worst drivel I have ever read. The author seems to know nothing about European geography or politics. His plot is ripped off from the delusions of someone else. Every time he throws in some little fact or snippet, it is wrong. Guaranteed wrong! He repeats urban legends without so much as a google search to verify their veracity, and tries to sell the grand plot as though there might be some truth in it!<br /><br />The author clearly sees himself in the role of the protaganist. He wants to think of himself as an academic, and his book as some kind of thesis. But the truth is that with the lack of critical thinking presented to us in this novel, Brown would not find himself so much as portering job in any respectable academic institution.<br /><br />Controversy sells. I read this book because someone said \\"with all the fuss about it there must be something in it\\". This book demonstrates ably the fallacy of that way of thinking. Despite all the fuss about this book, it really has no merit whatsoever. Possibly the worst book I ever read.
0321701763|5.0|This book is very easy to use.  Every chapter is well explained, step by step.  It makes you learn fast and in the comfort of your home.
0812550706|5.0|This book is one of my all time favorites. Perhaps these days I am less sure why that should be the case, but for some reason it still is.     The ending is perhaps predictable. The characters are perhaps not quite as realistic as they could be - although much of this can be explained by their unnatural intelligence perhaps. But the plot is good, novel and solid. Readers will be drawn in and carried along, and at the end of it you will simply not want to leave Ender be. The sequel is necessary (and in some aspects better than this one even).     I have read the book several times, including the original short story form, and every time Card writes a new Ender novel I read it. But, in fact, Card should really have quite after \\"Children of the Mind\\" if not before. Some of his recent shadow series has pretty much ruined the originals for me, and it becomes increasingly clear in later novels that he is not particularly au fait with the science that seems to form such an important aspect in this novel.     But that does not detract from this one. This novel is not one you would ever regret reading.
0691152640|3.0|This Time Is Different is a must read for anyone with an interest in markets and a long-term perspective on financial crises. The authors trace financial crises back about 800 years in minute detail which I found both interesting and elucidating. The over-riding message is to at all costs avoid getting caught up in the mainstream belief that in any bubble, the world has entered a new period of eternal prosperity and that unlike past events, will not end in crisis. This was the message in 2006 and 2007 from public figures from Ben Bernanke to leading economists that ever rising real estate prices were sustainable based on the axiom that soon became prevalent that since home prices had never dropped nationwide, they couldn't now. This led to the mortgage lending hubris and subprime beast that eventually brought the whole market (and almost brought the financial system) down. Those who bought this lie, paid a heavy price. Rogoff and Reinhart do an excellent job of comparing past financial crises to prepare the reader for a much longer then expected recovery period.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that the book could have delved more deeply into the history of fiat paper currencies and collapses.  Policy makers appear to be committing all the fiscal and monetary abuses that have plagued past fiat events so it is reasonable to assume that given our present trajectory, fiat money like the euro and USD will one day be worthless. Instead economists like Krugman continually harp that we need more stimulus (debt) to solve our debt crisis which is ludicrous if one stops to consider this suggestion for a moment yet it is one that is favored by pro-Keynesians the world over. Unfortunately we are sowing the seeds of the next crisis but few seem to see it coming.<br /><br />A good book that is not widely known discussing the history of fiat paper is Ralph T. Foster's Fiat Paper Money: The History and Evolution of our Currency.<br /><br />Disclosure - Author received complimentary review copy of this book from publisher.s book from publisher.
055357342X|3.0|This series is highly readable, and anyone who loves fantasy should find plenty to enjoy in this book. But why does it have to be so ridiculously long? Sure there is plenty going on, with as many threads interwoven as a fine tapestry - or at least a good pair of socks. Nevertheless, some of those threads could have been reduced to move the action along a little more quickly.     But my reasons for giving this only 3 stars must also include a feeling that this book is still rather derivative in a fantasy field that all too often takes its cue from Tolkien and/or fantasy role play games. It is yet another medieval setting with knights and priests and kings and tournaments and everything else that fantasy readers expect, but will put off readers new to the genre because it looks like a copy of Tolkien (sans elves, at least). The only novelty is the seasons, which do not turn with the years. But the logic of this kind of breaks when so many other aspects of our world are carried, as if verbatim, into this work. Sometimes Martin mentions something that just begs to put you in mind of our world, and so the otherness of this one does not stick.     Stylistically, all the characters seem to speak with the same voice. And the phrase \\"half a ...\\" seems to be one of Martin's favourites because we have \\"half a heartbeat\\" or \\"half a hundred\\" repeated so many times by so many characters that I wanted to scream each time I read it!     But if you want swords and sorcery in an earthy format and a good complex and engaging plot, you will enjoy these books.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'm a huge Star Wars fan:  I own Star Wars memorabilia, multiple versions of the same films, and even the animated and spin-off shows.  But, I may have reached the last straw with the changes George Lucas has made to his films.  The change of Han shooting Greedo was grating, but manageable.  But if the Darth Vader \\"no\\" howl at the end of Jedi is really true, then Lucas has truly forgotten what made the movies great and turned an unapologetic Star Wars fan into another disgruntled fan.  The change is beyond unnecessary, it changes the very feel of the end of the film series.  And it has changed my mind about buying the Blu Ray set.  Hopefully, this gets through to Lucas and he fixes what he \\"broke.\\"
0064410935|5.0|I read this book when I was 7 or 8, and was loving it - until the extremely sad penultimate chapter, which reduced me to tears and I was unable to complete the book. My mother had to take me through the last chapter, but to me it did not make up for the sadness!     But that does not stop me rating it 5 stars. It was a wonderful book, beautifully written for children. It just won't leave those children entirely unmoved.     I think it was shortly after this I was allowed to have a guinea pig. My parents obviously thought I needed to learn some lessons about the circle of life!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|My family and friends are so disappointed that this ends at Season 4. Minnie and the Pratt sisters are our favorites.  At last, a movie where families can come together and watch clean, funny, captivating and intriguing drama.  Creative writers for sure; never a dull moment.  I say again, WHERE IS SEASON 5?  It makes no sense to stop at Season 4!  Thomas needs a son. Will Dorcas ever marry? Is Twister immortal LOL?
B003M5AXN4|1.0|i really didnt like the choice of actors. speed and trixie were ok i guess, maybe a taller and more fit speed. sparky looked like a drug dealer. pops looked like a fat slouch instead of a healthy fit guy. goodmans acting was horrible for example when he tried to act stern. inspector detector didnt have the beard.  but, the lines given by the actor playing racer x were very convincing.     most of the scenes were shot way to fast leaving just a blur of information instead of telling the details of the story. that final race scene for example could have been the most awesome race ever but it was just a blur of cars flipping, bumping, crashing. speed won the race but there was no clear moment of a super skill driving trick that put him over.    the mach 5s specials features were not accurate or even complete. i really couldnt believe they didnt even credit those features to the genius of pops racer. they were added later to the mach 5 by a third party.    they could have picked a better plot. the whole thing about a teams financial status and the stock value and that racing is fixed i guess is all the news these days. the thing about the other racer not wanting to use the invitation and speed using it even though he didnt qualify and the way they got him in, didnt make sense. the violence of the teams lead driver being beaten and tortured was totally not needed. and speed saying that he wanted to enter the race because he wanted to harm those that wanted to harm his family was not something that the real speed would have said.  the real speed would fight in self defense but not set out to harm others. and rex faking his death - no way - i dont get it. running away from home is one thing but putting your family through that, not something the real rex would do.    i did like the way that they blended reality and cartoon with sort of surreal environments and characters. very innovative, and a first in the movie business, that i know of.    once again this could have beenan amazing movie if it had kept with the roots of the series and the cast more acted and resembled the originals. i have yet to see a series or show that was made into a movie that i really liked.
B00521LT8O|5.0|thank you amazon for enabling me to watch a show that airs in the uk one night and is available for me to watch the next morning. there is no other way that I could watch it so quickly without having to wait for it to be released in the states. you are a life saver. what would I do without you? and by the way, this season tops all the rest. they did such a super job this season. I have been biting my nails all year long! Rory has turned into such a fantastic character and I can never wait to see what happens with River Song!

0439023521|5.0|WOW although this series is considered to be for younger audiences these books are much deeper than that. So much to say about this book it being the first in the series. The characters are easy to love and they make you a part of the story almost immediately. I can't wait to see the movie.
0805086846|5.0|The book came exactly as described and quickly. I'm yet to read it, but all the reviews on it are great.
0439023491|5.0|WOW the second book in this series keeps the suspense going. You become so wrapped up in the story and what is going to happen next. Catching Fire is so much more than just a simple read its a great escape to a new adventure.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas has lost all credibility.  His once loved trilogy is now a monstrosity, with pointless, extraneous, and jarring changes polluting every release since VHS.  George and Lucasfilm, with all of their money and resources, refuse to put the effort into releasing the original, theatrical trilogy properly on Blu-Ray.  Lucasfilm famously included non-anamorphic, non-THX remastered Laserdisc ports of the OOT on the 2006 DVD's; essentially cutting off their nose to spite their face.  \\"You want the originals?  Here they are in the worst quality available.  Isn't that what you wanted?\\"  No, it isn't.  Lucasfilm, take a good, long look at the 5-disc Blade Runner Blu-Ray for how a landmark film with multiple cuts should be released.  Not only are there five (!) versions of the movie included (with the original theatrical version of course), but they were all painstakingly restored and remastered from a proper 4k scan. That kind of product is worth my hard-earned dollars.       Not spending another dime on anything Star Wars related.
0800141660|5.0|Having gotten very interested in Jane Austen lately, I watched this movie once again last week. I have owned it on VHS for about 13 years. It is, and always will be one of my favorite movies of all time. It has beautiful outdoor scenes, beautiful dialogue and superb acting. Time to get the DVD!
B004BSFSTA|4.0|I could not afford the Bose headphones, so was somewhat worried about buying a \\"lesser\\" product. But the Marshalls are very comfortable, even for long periods of time. They also do an excellent job at noise canceling. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
B0053Q9DQI|2.0|This movie evokes a great gothic mood and the outdoors shots are wonderful. The rest is forgettable. Presenting the movie in flashbacks is most likely very confusing for those viewers who did not read the book. There is not enough spunk in the portrayal of Jane and Rochester is too beautiful and flirty. The ending is chopped off and leaves one very disappointed. I much prefer the 70's production with George C. Scott and Susannah York, or the 1997 one with Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|How many of us spend any time imagining what our country or our world may be like in 100, 1000, 10,000 years?<br /><br />Hunger Games is one of the few books that both myself and my kids found fascinating. It was recommended summer reading for our 14 yr. old and, to my surprise, he almost literally devoured it in less than one day and immediately asked for 'part two' which he got instantly (Kindle magic). Out of curiosity I tried it myself and... guess what, I finished it in maybe 2 days, then continued with 'part two', then 'part three'.<br /><br />Initial plot classification - think of Stephen King's 'The Running Man' with a lot more context. America as we know it is gone and, centuries later all that's left is Panem, consisting of 'the Capitol', Evil Empire's rotten core, and the 12 impoverished 'districts' whose attempt at secession was defeated by the Capitol some 75 years ago. The districts are now reduced to specialized suppliers tasked with meeting Capitol's needs, constantly reminded of their past defeat, occupied and ruled by a force of ruthless 'peace keepers', the inhabitants arrested, tortured and executed for such capital offenses as bearing anything resembling a 'weapon' or crossing the district's electrified fenced border without authorization. Each district must provide 2 young teens, a boy and a girl to compete in the annual Hunger Games from each only one out of the 24 contestants emerges alive. The Hunger Games is one way the Capitol reminds the defeated districts who won the last war and who is still in control.<br /><br />Hunger Games is the story of Katniss, a 16 year old girl from 'District 12', the poorest of all districts, who volunteers into the games so that her 12 year old beloved sister may live. There's a lot more to the story but this is a book that's better read than read about in a review.<br /><br />Ms. Collins takes no prisoners. She wrote a story that's both depressingly and uncompromisingly dark and, surprisingly, daringly insightful into the meaning and the ultimate worth of human life, freedom, love, compassion, self sacrifice as they manifest themselves and transform themselves under extreme conditions. The Hunger Games are a captivating spectacle no one in Panem is allowed to miss. Suzanne Collins' chronicle of the 73rd edition of the games is a story we must all read because it depicts one possible future.htful into the meaning and the ultimate worth of human life, freedom, love, compassion, self sacrifice as they manifest themselves and transform themselves under extreme conditions.

B000AMJC2K|4.0|I looked at a number of support arms for my monitor but went with this one because it both elevates and extends the monitor forward and back.  Very well made, heavy construction, and feels very sturdy.  I wish it could move without having to loosen and then retighten things but I couldn't find one that would do that.  I had hoped to find one that moved like a spring arm lamp but couldn't.  This as as close as I came and it is very good.
0307279189|5.0|Born to Run  by Christopher McDougall is the best book I have read in many years.  I bought it for my dad for Father's Day and have given many other copies for gifts.  I am back to running after more than ten years off due to injuries.  Barefoot running is great,  I am thrilled to be back out every morning.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Star Wars is now totally defaced beyond recognition by a bully and barely resembles anything it once was. No elaboration is needed. Will never buy Star Wars again on this media or the next. Go ahead fanboys, mark my review as unhelpful.
B0059DOJGY|5.0|Not only is this a great Edguy CD, this is THE best CD of 2011. I can't stop listening to it. In the morning when I wake up it's already playing in my head. There is not one bad track on this CD and how many CDs have you heard lately that you can say THAT about? This is a great piece of music so expertly woven together that each track springs to life as the natural progression of the one before.  It's an ornate tapestry of sound woven by a Master.  Catchy, melodic metal with brilliant lyrics, great guitar solos and beautiful choruses that will grab you by the ears and stay with you long after the CD has stopped playing. These are custom tailored rock and roll anthems of the highest caliber. It doesn't get much better than this. But knowing the creative genius of Tobias Sammet, it probably will in the future.   Robin Hood starts it all off with a flourish; a joyful rock and roll romp. A great song and an excellent choice for the first single. The video is filled with as much fun and laughter as the song - seriously, check it out.  Nobody's Hero picks right up where Robin Hood left off, another instantly recognizable anthem. This CD packs a 1-2 punch that will have you begging for more. The guitar solo is excellent and Toby's vocals could not be more spot-on.   Rock Of Cashel is another gem with haunting Celtic influences that reminds me of The Scarecrow by Avantasia but this song definitely stands on its own.  Pandora's Box, a country-blues rocker that shows off Edguy's versatility. Nice to hear that Toby can wail with the best of them - move over Steven Tyler!   Breathe: a keyboard tour d'force that gets better with every listen. Two Out Of Seven: down and dirty, nitty-gritty rock. Faces In The Darkness: old fashioned heavy metal with a distinctive Edguy twist. The Arcane Guild:  if you insist on shoving music into narrow categories this is one for the Power Metal fans;  Edguy shows us what they do so well and so effortlessly.  Fire On The Downline: a beautiful echoing intro that segues into one of the more memorable choruses and riffs. Behind The Gates To Midnight World: Heavy Sabbathesque bell ringing counterpoint, very anthemic - somehow I can picture an entire arena swaying to this one. Every Night Without You: slow and tender ballad à la Edguy.   The bonus disc is an absolute necessity here. God Fallen Silent: a track that appeals on so many levels and would have easily been able to hold its own on the main disc. Aleister Crowley Memorial Boogie: Energetic; great guitars and keyboards. Then we come to the Slade cover Cum On Feel The Noize.   At first I was a bit puzzled as to why Edguy would resurrect this old standard but after reacquainting myself with the lyric, I got it. Standing In The Rain is my personal favorite here, an achingly beautiful, poignant ballad that fellow countrymen Scorpions couldn't have done any better.  This is a must have for old and new Edguy fans alike, the band at the pinnacle of their powers, a fully realized, mature, multi-faceted jewel of a CD. Hopefully this will finally get Edguy the attention they so richly deserve here in the U.S. of A. Grab this one NOW. Listen. Fall in love. Repeat. It's that simple.

B005HJAOLY|4.0|It is two weeks surrounding the Easter holidays the slowest time of the year on the nation's turnpikes, and the afternoon is the second-slowest time of the day, the hours between midnight and 5 am is the slowest time. One abandoned service stop on Mile 81 is about to receive some helpful traffic.   We have all driven on the rapid fast lane but time and tiredness takes it toll on our souls and a long overdue rest is always advised but where? After reading this you may think twice on exactly where you stop. When out there in your motor vehicle you see desperate souls looking like they are stranded its best to leave it to the Breakdown services or the Police, for might not be what it seems and you don't want to get caught up in a Venus fly trap of a point of no return stop. The skill of the Masterful writer Stephen King is he uses everyday people and everyday objects and throws them into mayhem and macabre he creates stories of gore and horror with themes of survival and triumph. This story flowed by fast and was put together in a good fashion which became a enjoyable short read.     [...]
0553801473|5.0|While I understand a lot of the critics have their points... after waiting six years, there should have been SOME sort of payoff after another 1000 pages... but I just couldn't help loving the book all the same. The character stories are superb, dialog is great, the plot flies along and changes direction abruptly all the time... simply a great book, hands down. The only real negative is now having to wait another six years for the sixth book.
B00479SVBU|4.0|It works exactly as it says it would, but my only issue is that there is no menu to quickly pick folders (albums). If you have 80 albums on your storage device (a flash drive in my case), it takes about 60 seconds to move 20 albums.  You have to go through all albums to get to the one you want.  Other than that, great product.
0062103377|4.0|I pre-ordered this book with somewhat low(er) expectations than most; I have the Supernatural encyclopedia of demons and monsters, and while that was very lore-informative, the voices weren't quite right, and there were a few little quibbles I had with the layout and such.    I don't have those with this.  David Reed gets the Bobby Singer voice.  If not perfectly (because there are a few places where I go \\"uh... okay, not Bobby\\") then pretty close, because it's comfortable to read it.  The sections on Bobby's wife Karen are excellent, not only because they match what was said on the show, but expound on it in a logical manner.  The book also deals with Bobby and Rufus, Bobby and the Winchesters, and all the kinds of things that Bobby goes through on a relatively \\"normal\\" day in addition to all that he knows about hunting.  There's also background on the Colt, the Knife, Dean's amulet, and most of the creepy things they've come up against.    Casual watchers of the show might be a little lost; Bobby makes many references to the things that have happened up through the sixth (at the time of this review, most current) season as well as a couple of cases that Sam and Dean have covered but we haven't seen.  It's a book that's deeply rooted in the mythology of the show while making it interesting; you follow Bobby on his mental decline, and while I won't say a word about content of the ending or what goes on, I will say that it is definitely satisfying.  It's sort of like an episode unto itself, not unlike \\"Weekend at Bobby's,\\" where the action focuses not on the Winchesters, but on Bobby Singer.  As the title says, it's Bobby Singer's Guide to Hunting.  I almost expected \\"Ya Idjit\\" to be part of the formal title.    It's not nearly as dry as a read as The \\"Supernatural\\" Book of Monsters, Spirits, Demons, and Ghouls, but it's just as informative.  The physical size of the book is nice, too; it's not a huge trade-paperback size like the Monsters book, instead being just alittle bit bigger than a standard paperback.  It's easier to hold, easier to read, and easier to carry in my purse.  All in all, definitely a good purchase.

0515141429|5.0|I started reading this series based on a friend's recommendation and haven't been disappointed.  I purchased the first two books through Amazon to give the series a trial.  I blew through both books quickly, and before reading the end of the second book got online and ordered the next four books.  After reading the ending of the second book, and with some reflection, I realized that I had made a horrible mistake.  I promptly got online and ordered the four books AFTER the four I had already ordered as well.  I look forward to the delivery of those eight books!    This book was a very good story and a great introduction to the Jack Reacher character. He's smart as a whip and knows how to take care of himself.  The story is engaging on a lot of different levels, and recalls, at least to me, not only a little bit of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer stories, but also of Sherlock Holmes for the main character's amazing deductive ability.    If you a fan of mystery/suspense/crime fiction novels, I highly recommend this.

B003O86FMW|4.0|This is a remarkable follow-up to the Hunger Games. The only negative I have is that there were some points where you easily figure out things several chapters before Katniss does, and it's a little frustrating because you just want her to hurry up and get it! I had already figured out the \\"twist\\" at the end long before it happened, which was a bit of a let down, and the only reason I can't give 5 stars (I wish I could give 4.5 though). But that being said, the story moved at a perfect pace and my interest never waned. Despite unraveling the mystery sooner than I wanted, the story was still so beautifully written and interesting that it easily kept my attention, plus there were plenty of smaller twists to keep me guessing. Just like the first book, I read this in less than 24 hours because I simply couldn't put it down.
B000IJ6QTC|5.0|This is the set I'm sure most all star wars fans are looking for (if they dont already have).  It contains BOTH the original theatrical releases as well as the newer special edition releases.  These three movies came in a tin box and was released sometime in 2005...or 2006.  Of course its only in standard DVD format.  As great an option this is (exactly what I wanted) dont spend 180 bucks on it.  As much I love star wars (lucas is a visionary and his movies are legendary..) lucas is greedy son of a B... When I bought this set back during its release, it must have been close 30-40 bucks.  Im sure lucas knows that the vast majority of star wars fans would prefer the original theatrical release (for obvious reasons) and thus probably likes to watch those same fans fight for these versions.    Though my advice is to check up on ebay and other auction sites.  Ideally, it would have been nice if the Blu-ray discs had AT LEAST the original theatrical version in standard-DVD format....but I guess Lucas enjoys playing the waiting game...making more money off us.
1401324517|5.0|I love Rafa's story, it's honest, interesting and enjoyable to the point of not being able to stop reading until I'd finished it. Yes, I read it in one sitting and am hoping for a sequil! I'm also reading this again now!     I'm a huge Rafa fan but I think any tennis fan would enjoy reading this as would any sports fan.     I do tend to buy anything Rafa related and read anything Rafa related (I did say I'm a huge fan!) but don't let that put you off if you're not such a big fan of his because I'm sure any tennis or sports fan or ametaur player would be interested and motivated to read Rafa's story, his highs and lows and his determination to overcome setbacks is very inspiring as is the fact that he's genuine and considerate person, it shows you don't have to smash rackets and be rude to people to be successful, he's a great example for young kids starting out in tennis or other sports, they couldn't have a better role model or hero to look up to and emulate.     Other fans of Rafa's would also enjoy [[ASIN:0956526608 The Poetry of Passion (for People with a Pulse)]] which contains lots of poems about him (in the very long chapter called \\"A Fan's Feelings\\") I also read that in one sitting and keep re-reading it! Also the DVD of the Wimbledon 2008 final which Rafa talks about in his book [[ASIN:B001CWYUBU Wimbledon - The 2008 Finals: Nadal vs. Federer / Widescreen]] A must for Rafa fans.
B004EPYZXK|3.0|Okay, just got back from the movies after watching this film.  Its the usual found footage film so if you like this genre I am sure you will enjoy the film.  Yes it could have been a lot better in many places, but if you like the trailer there is a good chance you will like the film.
B0057A6GA6|1.0|Great game, but on each level, it ends up freezing near the last wave.  I have to power down my tablet and re-boot it to get it to work again.  It does save the game, but not from my last point always.  I play again for a bit, then it freezes again.  I'll leave feedback for the developer too and hopefully they can fix the problem.

B004MARLJ2|4.0|This review is based on my Samsung Epic 4G, stock Froyo.  Everlands HD is a nice strategy game that uses animals who have unique attacks and abilities.  The music is good and the graphics have a nice cartoon-like feel to them and the story is mildly interesting.  The application has never crashed since I installed it, which is something that seems to plague many Android applications.  Don't expect a lot of visuals other than minimal animation when the animals attack each other, but this is a high quality game application for Android.
B004X2M3SI|5.0|This truly has something for everyone. The writing's fabulous, and the endings are delving into some real mind-bending story arcs. Me likey.
B004IY6API|5.0|Stained Class is an album that cemented Judas Priest into the annals of Rock and Roll glory. Exiter is a song that brings out images of a terrifying being when White Heat Red Hot is a continuation of the tale. The cover is an image of a melting skullwith rods running through it. That gives the image of Exiter although the name of Stained Class is the name of a song that talks about the fall of man, thus giving also a need for the image of a melting skull.   Rob Halford is a great songwriter when the same is with Ian Hill and Glen Tipton as well as KK Downing while Les Binks was also a great songwriter with them. Downing and Tipton are amazing guitarists and Hill is a great Bassist when Binks was a great Drummer. Sadly Dave Holand was also a great drummer but he disgraced his life and reputation and now has to live with that FOREVER.   Judas Priest is a band that I always liked and now they are one of my favorates. I hope that Halford writes a book about his life for his tale is one of survivial.
B002NT3B52|5.0|This is a fantastic book for those who want to relate to their companions in a deeper, more profound manner.  I won't be able to look at my dog in the same way again.  Ms. Horowitz writes with a wonder sense of humor using heart wrenching anecdotes all the while give a good layman's explaination of the science behind understanding the umwelt of dogs.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to see what their dog \\"sees\\".
0345505387|2.0|This graphic novel retells the first half of Outlander, but adds nothing new to the story.  The illustrations, while well-drawn, were not what I expected.  I would only recommend purchasing this small book if you are a fan of graphic novels and want to have a collector's set of Gabaldon's books.  Anxiously awaiting the next novel!
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|When I first stumbled upon this film by accident while channel surfing one day I was immediately struck by how unique it was as I had not seen any sci-fi film that held its premise before.  This premise that we will soon be able to dictate our genes and hence will be able to discriminate on genes was also scary as it is now a clear a present possibility as well.  The deleted scene which showed how using this criteria to decide who gets born and who doesn't would have deprived us of Abraham Lincoln, Emily Dickinson, Albert Einstein etc was also very powerful and really should have been left in the original film.  This was also the first film that introduced me to Jude Law and it showed me just how good an actor he was even way back then.  Being a fan of noir I couldn't help but feel its influence on this film as well.  This blu-ray version is a real treat for fans as it looks great in 1080p and sounds great in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The special feature documentaries are also decent making this to date the definitive version of a great sci-fi film.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B004WKOCP8|1.0|I describe Incubus as \\"my first favorite band\\".  Been nuts about them since middle school.  With that being said, this album is awful.  I am truly let down with them.  Brandon sounds like he is auditioning for Glee, there is hokey piano in nearly every song, and nothing but weak guitar riffs, when the guitar used to be a major strength of this group.  Very little funk, just trying way too hard.  Bummer.
B000Q7ZNDG|5.0|This release of the full-length version of Shakespeare's masterpiece is a real treat for fans.  It is everything that I personally am looking for in any blu-ray release to justify any double-dipping over the standard dvd version.  It firstly comes in a very well designed and assembled digibook format; the picture quality is glorious in 1080p and the sound quality in DTS HD MA is excellent as well although as this is mostly speech-driven, the DTS Surround sound doesn't really have a chance to show off its full potential but I suppose more is better than less even in this case.  Other than for a very few scenes such as the ghost scenes, the film is mostly front heavy with regards the sound.  While \\"Hamlet\\" is very good I personally prefer \\"Macbeth\\" as my all-time favourite play of the Bard's and as it is the second shortest of his plays, I hope that a similar treatment can be done with word-for-word scripting as it was done here.  It could be like a \\"Braveheart\\" type film and would be very exciting indeed.  As \\"Macbeth\\" is shorter than \\"Hamlet\\" even the complete version should clock in at quite a bit less than the 4 hours here and as a testament to how great this version is, I didn't even feel the time go by and I was even irritated at the \\"intermission\\" where I would have preferred it to continue; after all, we are watching a blu-ray and so we can make our own \\"intermission\\" at any time using the \\"pause\\" button.<br /><br />I watched this film while following along with the written word in my [[ASIN:0760703329 Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Barnes & Noble Leather Classic)]] and I realised that for a couple of scenes, other than the obvious time period setting etc Branagh took some liberties like moving them around a little e.g. the end of Act 3 Scene 2 and at least for me it was amusing catching out a couple of actors who said the wrong words e.g. Robin Williams' Osric \\"Sweet Lord, if your friendship were at leisure\\" when it should have been \\"lordship\\" and during \\"The Mousetrap\\" when the actress queen says \\"In either naught, or in extremity\\" when it should be \\"neither aught\\" etc.  I guess it is very difficult for actors when they don't completely understand what they are saying.  I was most impressed with Charlton Heston who was magnificent and even he miss-stated one word but all this wasn't a big deal for me as I still enjoyed the entire film a great deal which is clearly head and shoulders above the many previous versions and especially the Mel Gibson version.<br /><br />A highly enjoyable experience for Shakespeare fans and I wait in hope for a similar treatment of my personal favourite \\"Macbeth\\" to be made.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!Mousetrap\\" when the actress queen says \\"In either naught, or in extremity\\" when it should be \\"neither aught\\" etc.  I guess it is very difficult for actors when they don't completely understand what they are saying.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|A great classic Hayao Miyazaki film. It is more mature than most of his works, but It works well and has a strong environmental message.
B00000AF95|4.0|Two guitarists who will forever be a part of KISS' legacy and also considered by many to be key members of the group despite their brief runs with the band, are Vinnie Vincent and Mark St. John.  Vincent's energetic style of guitar playing and knack for catchy lyrics and hooks helped put Lick It Up on the map and re-ignited interest in KISS.  His ego and onstage antics, however, got him booted from the group after only recording one album.<br /><br />In April of 1984, Mark St. John was handpicked to be Vincent's replacement and quickly established himself as a team player and an amazing guitarist.  His active duty with the band would be even shorter than Vincent's, but his exit came due to chronic Reiter's Syndrome and not his ego.<br /><br />With that said, St. John's only recorded contributions to KISS came in the form of September, 1984's Animalize.  Fans would not be disappointed.<br /><br />Animalize wakes up the listener right away with the very fast, heavily glammed I've Had Enough (Into The Fire).  It is followed by the equally glammy Heaven's On Fire, the biggest single to be released from the album and one of just a select few 80's KISS tracks to make it into their concert rotation.<br /><br />The next song doesn't slow down the high rate of speed set by the previous tracks.  About the only thing it does differently is make the album dirtier....a lot dirtier.  The track, entitled Burn Bitch Burn, has nothing to do with the Salem Witch Trials and everything to do with Gene Simmons' favorite pasttime.  If I have to explain this track any more, your ears are much too tender for the rest of this album!<br /><br />Get All You Can Take comes next, and serves up a little inspiration for those of us who are struggling to make something of ourselves.  That's followed by the very slinky Lonely Is The Hunter, which is probably the slowest song on the entire album.<br /><br />Next is the fast but forgettable Under The Gun.  If anything plagued KISS' music during the 80's, it's that they often had a  bit of filler on each album.  This song, along with Simmons' Murder In High Heels play that role on this album.<br /><br />Two other tracks that are very good are sandwiched between Under The Gun and Murder In High Heels.  Those songs are the album's second single, the pop rocker Thrills In The Night and the very up tempo While The City Sleeps.<br /><br />St. John, while more than capable of playing excellent glam guitar, did a brilliant job of holding back when necessary and unleashing his fury when called upon.  His solos throughout the album gave listeners more than enough proof as to why KISS picked him to be Vinnie Vincent's replacement.<br /><br />Paul Stanley, ever the professional, juked and danced his way through all of his tracks, all the while taking the controls as producer and co-writing five of the albums songs.<br /><br />Gene Simmons, when available, sounded exceptionally good, but I felt as if his bass work was pushed to the background on this album more than any other album he performed on.  Perhaps it was due to the fact that he was also hoping to break ground as an actor and not giving 100% to the band.<br /><br />Eric Carr was flawless as usual.  There's really not much more to say about the man other than he remains one of the best drummers in rock history despite having been deceased for twenty years.<br /><br />It should be noted that Mark St. John played guitar on all but two tracks on this album.  Those tracks, Lonely Is The Hunter and Murder In High Heels, featured St. John's eventual replacement, Bruce Kulick.<br /><br />While Animalize might lack a lot of recognizable tunes to the casual KISS fan, hardcore KISS Army soldiers realize what a gem this album really is.  Like all of the band's other 1980's offerings, it takes a few listens to truly appreciate how good this serving of KISS really is.<br /><br />Recommended.0's, it's that they often had a  bit of filler on each album.

1557048630|5.0|Since this is one of my favorite animation movies ever and I am currently studying digital arts, since I knew of the existence of this book I knew I should have.  unfortunately I couldn't find it here in Mexico, so I bought it here on Amazon and I could say it was totally worth the packaging costs and the waiting time. I love each of it's pages, it's images and all the information about some of the process in which this movie was made.  If you like the movie and/or are interested in digital arts, filmaking or art design, this book is a must! The illustrations are just amazing!

0307269752|2.0|I don't get it. Is having a heroine who goes against type reason enough to call someone an interesting character? The writing is stilted (some of it may be due to translation, giving the benefit...),character development non-existent, and the outcome obvious. Where's the mystery? Where's the imagination? I also, like several reviewers, bought the first two books of the series..I labored through the first, then gave up early in the second book of the series.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this film! While I am a true fan of the 2006 version of Jane Eyre, I must admit to being a HUGE Michael Fassbender fan and have been looking forward to seeing this adaptation of the film since hearing about it last year. I think Fassbender did a terrific portrayal of Mr. Rochester, and Mia shocked me with her perfect rendition of Jane. Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to view this film in the theater but sure wish I would've! I really missed out! Immediately after watching it, I wanted to watch it again. Casting for this film was perfect, and the director did a fantastic job with the overall setting and cinematography. The lighting/setting was appropriately dark and gloomy. If you are a fan of period films, you will not be disappointed. My only complaint is I wish the film would have been a bit longer. I wanted MORE, and I feel many key details and important parts from the book were left out in this film adaptation. Nevertheless, I would watch it again. In fact, I will be purchasing it to add to BBC collection! I am holding off for a while in hopes that an alternate version/director's cut will be released soon :)
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Great movie with awesome action and great graphics for its time. The plot is a little difficult to understand if you haven't played the game, but it still has a great theme nevertheless.   The special edition isn't that special; besides the \\"making of the movie\\" part, the deleted scenes weren't that special etc.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Not a fan actually never wanted to see any of them.  Now they are on blu-ray and I plan to buy the box set. So all this and that about not the original all this nit picking doesn't affect me or the millions of others who will flock to buy these dvds.  Now who is Jar Jar?
0143034901|5.0|A surprising and gratifying read that you are lured into. One of my all time favourites, which I admit reach over a 1000.........still a wonderful way of escaping to Spain without travelling anywhere except in your mind.

B002ZG99TK|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Granted, I have a thing for trains but I thought it was a smart action movie.  My initial thought was it would more of a \\"made for TV\\" type film but I was glad I was wrong.  The plot, while certainly enhanced for Hollywood, was plausible and well portrayed given that it was inspired by actual events.  If you like a good action flick and, especially, if you are a railfan, you want to see Unstoppable.
1609611543|5.0|We read parts of this book at a family gathering over Labor Day.  We are now sending a copy of the book to all family members for Christmas.  Dr. Davis lays out a path to healthy eating which challenges the 'eat whole wheat and thrive' message we've been living for years.  Written with a strong dose of both facts and humor, this book is informative and useful.  We came home and cleaned out our refridgerator and are stocking up for our new eating which leaves out breakfast cereal and bread and many other unhealthy crutches we have been leaning on.  We're excited and we thank Dr. Davis for this great book!
B000002IQ9|5.0|I absolutely love this cd.  I had owned this cd before but it got ruined by my boys.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon since I hadn't been able to find it in stores.  However, the information said it was new but when it arrived the celaphane wrapper was somewhat torn and loose.  I didn't think much of it since it is a very old recording.  The problem is when I played it the first time there is one song that does not play without skipping.  I looked at it and there is a scratch on it which is causing the problem.

It's a very \\"Hollywood\\" rip off of \\"Black Hawk Down\\" and \\"District 9\\" rolled together with \\"B\\" actors, with a little CGI sprinkled on top.<br /><br />This is just another \\"me too\\" movie, not worth the purchase really.<br /><br />Synopses:  Earth attacked by aliens, Underdog band of soldiers waltz in and save world, where the rest of the \\"powers that be\\" failed. Add some bravado at every opportunity. The end.<br /><br />I'm sure I've seen this premiss in several other movies, and probably better done.<br /><br />Spend your money on a better movie.
B0043ZDFEQ|1.0|I hate that I bought this album and I wish I could return it or sell it for a greatly reduced price.  I bought it because Bruno Mars has a great voice.  I hoped that it would all be great.  It wasn't.  Some of the stupidest lyrics I've ever heard in my life and poppy little songs that, reinforced by the radio overplaying them, makes me want to shoot myself in the ears so I won't have to listen to it anymore.  I gave Bruno more than a fair chance- I actually expected to like this album.  Do not buy it, it's terrible.
1433527189|5.0|This says the cover is paperback. It is actually leather! Much nicer than I expected. The type is a bit small, but considering the extra helps on every page, larger text would make for a volume too large to handle comfortably.
B001AQO400|5.0|If you read any number of these reviews, you'll be able to read a very long synopsis of this move. Also, if you were to check out the product description, you'd get another synopsis. And I assume if you're thinking of purchasing 'Lost in Translation [Blu-ray]', chances are you've already seen this movie. So, I'm not going to go into the synopsis of this movie. The only question you're asking yourself is, is the Blu-ray worth the upgrade? As a Japanese major, currently in the United States, hoping to spend my life their after college, and as someone who is such a big fan of this movie they bought the DVD, Blu-ray, Soundtrack, and have a giant poster of Scarlett Johansson walking through  (Shibuya) on my wall, I can tell you that this movie is definitely one to purchase on Blu-ray.     The only disappointment about this version, is that the same bonus features from the DVD are included. There is nothing new to be seen. It would've been nice to have an interview with the cast and crew now, or at least just the director, Sofia Coppola, about their thoughts on the movie. But sadly, nothing. Other than the lack of new and exciting features, there are no other down sides.    The best part about the movie, was not only was it specifically reformatted to fit all the new fancy 1080p widescreen TVs perfectly, but there are scenes in the movie (not all) but the ones that count, have been digitally remastered, and look better than ever!     (As mentioned) not every scene has been remastered. But the opening scene where Bob Harris (Bill Murray) first arrives in Tokyo, and the best (and my favorite sequence) the montage of when Charlotte  (Scarlett Johansson) goes to  (Kyoto) look better than ever. And these scenes alone, are the reason why you should upgrade to the Blu-ray.    So basically, if you're as big a fan of this movie as I am, you'll enjoy this version. That's pretty much it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It's simple Lucas and company:    1) Fix the originals(IV-VI) so that they are the actual 'originals' we saw in the late 70's and early 80's.  2) Add in the new ones(I-III).  3) Put them all on Blu-Ray.  4) Stop trying to make it better with new add-ins and CGI; you only seem to make it worse every time. Just give us the original movies we fell in love with!    Is it really that hard?!
B002OSXDAU|3.0|The Fountainhead is a great piece of literature. The kindle makes it even easier to grasp because of the sheer length of the actual paperback. The problem with the kindle version is the number of spelling and grammatical errors. Amazon, please fix this!
B005COO1X6|5.0|This short story is a welcome addition to any King collection.  Exclusively in eBook, this was a joy to read on the Kindle.  King once again proves that he is a master at creating characters that you'd swear are living a breathing even after you put the book down (that is, if they survive).      I will say that the formatting of this Kindle book could have been improved slightly, where \\"chapter\\" endings just kept going into the heading of the next section.  I would have liked the feel of pages turning - even if there are no real standards in presentation when it comes to the digital world.     Plot-wise, this Kindle book took about two days for me to read.  I really savored this one, and even if I'd wanted to, I don't think that I'd have been able to finish it in one sitting after a full day of working and traveling.  The characters are quickly conjured by King and immediately developed in the reader's mind - it's that good.  I could picture them after only a few paragraphs.  Perfect story for the start of Autumn.  I will say this, however - the ending brought a smile to my face.    As an added bonus, this Kindle edition comes with a sneak peek at King's new novel out in November.  I was curious to see what the publisher picked as an excerpt, and I have to say, this was a nice tease for what's to come.  Highly recommended and well worth the money.
B0036S4C6G|2.0|Having been involved in the underground rock music industry a few decades ago, I expected to really enjoy A Visit from the Goon Squad, with its references to the bands, drugs, and attitudes of that era. In this tapestry-like novel, Jennifer Egan checks in on a variety of characters who either work in the music industry or are musicians over the course of their lives, from dysfunctional young adulthood to compromised middle age. However I found it to be an overly contrived and rather glum book. I suppose it is a meditation on the passage of time and the difficulty of knowing other people, but I did not feel like Egan had anything particularly meaningful to say about those themes. I also thought that I was supposed to find the character of Sasha intriguing, as several characters in the book did, but she really had nothing particulary interesting going on in her head.     If you like novels with a dose of youthful angst, I would recommend The Mysteries of Pittsburgh by Michael Chabon, and if you want to try a postmodern book with a lot of heart, I would recommend A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggars.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Growing up I liked Star Wars not loved it but liked it. With that said over the years I have went to like to hate. This is the main reason why. Over the years George Lucas has given us so many different versions of Start Wars and for some reason we seem to buy them all. I have never seen a creator Change their work as much as George has. I understand that cleaning it up and improving the sound is a good thing and i am for that. However adding voice overs and Scenes is totally uncalled for. I will bet that in a year or so there will be another version of this film maybe in 3d or something. I say wait until George comes up with another dumb idea to hurt and destroy this what was a good piece of work and film making before you spend your hard earn cash over and over and over again.
B004RSCWZ2|1.0|I am a long time huge fan of both Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks. I've heard both of them live and they are supreme talents. I don't understand this CD at all. Every song except cut #9 is slow and bland and uninspiring. It's almost like the whole CD is one long slow song. It's the only CD that I've bought in recent memory that I actually would like to return just because it's so lame. I don't even know if you could characterize it as blues. It's just slow boring music. Don't waste your money.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I must say, I spent a good two months deciding on what headphones to buy for my xbox360.  I finally decided on the Turtle Beach x41. I was concerned about feedback, interference, crackling, and every other thing people complained about in other reviews. I have experienced nothing but crystal clear 5.1 surround sound. I have had the headset for a few weeks now. I don't know if it has improved my gaming in Black Ops, it was a bit overwhelming at first. Hearing every bullet, bugs  in the air, music playing was a amazing. I actually thought I was experiencing feedback on Grid in Black Ops.... but it was simply the fact that my team spawned in domination next to the power station.  The buzzing was something I had never heard before even with my surround sound speakers.  I have the receiver set right on top of my 360 with 1st generation wireless network adapter, a wireless router, and my iMac running using airport in the next room . Still no feedback or interference, even using Comcast and their crazy throttling.    One complaint is that the chat volume control takes some fiddling to get the right volume set.  First time I used it I was blown away at how loud my friends were.      Overall, very pleased with this purchase. So is my wife... she does not have to hear the announcer say my killstreaks over and over!
B004LWZVZC|5.0|The movie starts with the assassination of President Lincoln and moves quickly to the trial. This was done so the audience would get a feel about how rushed the trial had become. James McAvoy plays Frederick Aiken, the Union officer forced to defend Mary. He believes she is guilty. Mary (Robin Wright) is a quiet woman who is a solid block of courage. She is a rebel sympathizer. The conspiracy meetings took place at her boarding house. The movie shows her face during the trial with occasional outbursts. This was not the case. Her face was veiled during most of the trial and during the testimony of her daughter Anna. However, no woman in Hollywood wants to play that role, so they had her unveiled.<br /><br />Robin Wright looked very much like the depiction we have of Mary Surratt. Noticed how the Secretary of Defense took charge of the situation after the assassination and would allow the VP to take over when he said so. The acting was good and the historical dress and background characters seemed to be accurate down to the straw hats worn by the hangmen.<br /><br />Robert Redford just doesn't choose movies to direct because he thinks they would make good movies. The movies are selected in order to make comparisons to our world today. The question of the legality of the military court for the conspirators is the same legal question that exists today for those at Guantanamo. Just substitute 9-11 for the assassination, and Muslims for confederates. There were threats of biological warfare and \\"the world has forever changed.\\" Mr. Aiken claims how his prisoner is mistreated. It is countered by \\"How you forgotten how our people are treated by the rebels?\\" Mary is \\"Catholic.\\" She wears black from head to toe. She is said to spit on every Union soldier and wears a bone from a Union soldier around her neck. They demonize and dehumanize her. Sound familiar?
0439023513|4.0|This book is a must read for anyone who has read \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire\\"  It wraps up the series nicely.  Can't wait till the movies come out.
B005KGPC4S|2.0|Where to start.  Right away with the 5 minutes of preposition in the classroom I knew it was going to be a lazily written movie.  I just didn't know how bad. I can look past a lot of things but there are too many instances where the characters actions were far too outlandish, even in an outlandish movie.  The setup of getting the teenagers to the church was very B Movie in and of itself. Then you have a teenager with a fully loaded, fully automatic weapon who decides to run through a crowd of armed people as opposed to fire a few shots.  I commend the movie for shooting him unexpectedly at least.  Then the focal characters get killed easily, and I'm thinking...what's the point? If there was more to the movie, and more plot, more character development I would applaud the unexpected killing of some of the main characters, but this isn't A Game of Thrones and it just left me thinking I wasted $11.
0743496728|1.0|it's the worst novel my teenagers have ever read . Very depressing. My kids had to read for school, so I started reading the book to see what they were talking about, by the middle of the book I was so depressed that I stopped reading.  I know that the schools are trying to show the real world to the kids but do they really need more depressing thins in life???
B000XPU5NY|5.0|After reading the reviews regarding the change of key and the critisisms about this fact I can honestly say what utter nonsense! I had no perception of a drop n key when I spun this disc the first time, the only impression I got was utter awe at the sound quality and the musicianship and I thought Phil sounded ace, I did not get the feeling I was listening to a man in his 60s but rather his 20s. The choice of tracks is spot on on this CD. Anyone who is interested in Genesis who would like to start out on a best of compilation...don't. Buy this Live CD first, then when you are blown away by it, then and only then start back tracking through the back catalogue of their other brilliant work. I will finish by saying that the merging of the Cage, Duke's travels, and cinema show was a spine tingling goosebump moment for me. I really wish that Genesis would record another new studio album but I know this will never happen, but they have ended on a high note with this offering. The masters of progressive rock really do rock!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I purchased this to go with my Graco IPO Stroller-Platinum since the stroller does not have cup holders and Amazon recommended that other people purchased this product along with the stroller. I think it is definitely a must have. My husband and I loved the fact that we had two cup holders and a place to put our camera and other snack goodies as we walked around Disneyland and Sea World. It worked out and had so much space. Also everytime we had to fold the stroller to get on the tram or train we did not have to remove the accessory it fit perfectly that when we folded our stroller it did not get in the way. I would recommend this to anyone who does not have a cup holdr on their stroller. Also it did not get in the way of my baby bag which we hang from the stroller handles as well.
B0000028M7|5.0|I have been looking for this CD like forever. I finally found it here @ Amazon.com. I am so glad to have this in my music collection again.
0553801473|5.0|I purchased this as a gift and my husband loved it. He is a fan of the series and has read every book prior.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I LOVE this movie!! I'm 32 and I'm surprised to say I enjoyed everything about this movie. Not only was the movie well adapted for kids but adults can sit back and relate to the story line and have a good time. Grusome villian Gru is trying to devise the ultimate villian heist by stealing the moon! (yes the moon in space that orbits earth lol) so he adopts 3 little adorable orphan sisters to secretly help him with his evil plan.<br /><br />The artictic vision, characters, plot last but not least the soundtrack produced by Pharrell of the neptunes are well done!!<br /><br />Cute heartfelt ending!! fun for all ages.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|I have the Bluray combo pack, I used to love the digital copy aspect of things but if you have computer failure you lose your copy and you can't back up your digital copy.    We love the movie, it's really colorful and bright. Funny and the music is nice too.     I haven't had any issues with the bluray disc or the dvd.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love the game. My daughter has it on her Nintendo DS. I like the feel of the cell phone app better. I would have paid twice as much. HTC Incredible.
B0055PMUSU|5.0|Whether or not you are a fan of surfing, you will surely become a fan of one surfer, Bethany, after viewing this movie. Her (true) story just moved our entire family and lifted us up in so many ways. We are reminded throughout this movie that God can take any situation, yes even the really bad ones, and bring something better than you could ever imagine out of it. This true story had me crying, cheering, and feeling a deep sense of awe at just how amazing our God is. This is one of those few movies that I can recommend to anyone without the least hesitation. There are so many Biblical truths paralleled and reiterated in the various events in Soul Surfer. For me, without giving too much of the movie away, there is a scene where Bethany is waiting for a wave, while others ask, \\"What is she doing?\\" This to me is a great example of faith--believing without seeing.<br />There are some big names and great acting in this picture, and the movie is not shy about giving the glory to Jesus. This story is like this generation's \\"Joni\\" in many ways. Soul Surfer would be a great movie for family movie night, or any time for that matter. This is one we want in our video collection, it's that good. Don't know what to watch? Watch this, you won't be sorry!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|The game is difficult at times. Hands down the best puzzle game out. I love the challenge it brings. Runs great on the HTC Incredible
0553382179|5.0|Excellent book would highly recommend it for any one wanting to clean up and organize their space. I am now a Flylady follower!
B001UHOWXI|5.0|I alwasy wanted this DVD in my collection. I am not sure why I waited so long to make the purchase. Having both the color and black and white version was an added bonus to an already wonderful movie.
B004YF6MHW|4.0|I love this app. I have been using it quite a lot lately and the image quality is simple amazing. Camera Zoom FX has replaced my stock camera for sure. The only issue I found is that it can be slugish when opening up. It can make my phone freeze for about 10 seconds if I leave it open and lock the phone. Running on EVO 4G
B004J4WN0I|5.0|This is the first review I've ever written.  I'll keep it short. Loved all three of the series and want more.
B0002KZAKS|4.0|I purchased this mic for two reasons: One, I wanted to record guitar and vocals. Two, I was on a budget.    The Behringer XM8500 was recommend by a few sites as a decent budget microphone with good quality, so I decided to give it a try. I purchased it for $25 on eBay (as of writing it is now $20 on Amazon) at the end of January, and it felt like a solid mic that would last a while (this is foreshadowing, friends). While the description says the mic is good for both vocals and amplified instruments, that's only half true. When recording vocals, it sounded great - I don't have the best ear for recordings, but to me, it sounded clear and and uncolored. But when it came to recording electric guitar, the sound didn't hold up as well. I didn't experience any distortion, but my recordings turned out being very \\"muddy\\", and if I didn't palm mute perfectly, I would get a loud \\"WHUMPH!\\" sound from it. It's a good enough microphone to capture your rough ideas for later reference, but it wouldn't stand up to professional recording. But I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I could get high quality acoustic guitar tracks - I wouldn't be afraid to use them in my recorded music.    Now, fast forward to September. By this point, I'll be honest, I'd dropped the mic a few times - never higher than a foot, and never onto anything but carpeted floor - but I still had. I recently found myself having problems with getting sound from it, as it would cut out occasionally. Eventually it got to the point where it would not output sound at all - I'd tried several different cables and connectors, but no luck. All I get now is static from the microphone itself if I move it around at all. With the construction of this microphone, I expected it to be able to take a bit more abuse - since the description says it stands up to live performance. I did get 7 months of use out of it for $25, though, so I can't rate it any lower than three stars and be able to sleep at night.    The Final Verdict?    PROS   - Provides clear, clean vocals   - Able to record high quality acoustic tracks   - Good for demoing electric guitar tracks   - Low price    CONS   - Muddy, \\"whumph\\"-y sound on electric guitar tracks   - Lasted less than a year before breaking    All in all, this mic is fairly solid for the price - it'll serve you well for vocals and acoustic guitar, provide you a way to get rough sketches of electric tracks, and it's perfect for a budget musician. But be wary that it may not last all that long, because you do get what you pay for.
B003F3NDOO|5.0|This show is quick witted and very well-written, with a great cast. The show starts off slowly, with a theme that revolves around Courtney Cox's character acting like a 'Cougar' and dating younger men. However a few episodes into the series the show seemed to hit it's stride as the characters developed into those reflected on the show today. The cast has great chemistry, and their comedic plays on one another are fantastic. The show thankfully evolved into one that is about a tight-knit group of friends (the cul-da-sac crew!) and all of the ways their lives interact. There is quite a bit of talk about the show getting a new name in it's upcoming 3rd season, which I personally feel would be a blessing. This is a show that is about far more than 'Cougars' - and I think people fail to give it a fair chance because of the title. If you like shows with like Scrubs, Modern Family, and yes, Courtney's own little hit - Friends - I suggest you give Cougar Town a try.
B000BNI99K|5.0|While I was receiving radiation treatment for breast cancer, each day I would listen to THIS collection piped into the treatment room.  I could understand ALL the words and knew the songs by heart.  So, when my folks celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary, THIS was my 'go-to-gift' for them - the GIFT of MUSIC, songs from the 1940's through the 1960's.  My Mom and Dad are still singing duets to Rod's collection ... it's really very lovely to see and to hear them make such sweet music, together.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Plenty of a challenge to keep you interested for long enough until the next free game. Good graphics, not difficult to figure out and plenty of features.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I went to an advanced screening (my first) and I must feel the need to brag about how lucky I was to see it a week before everyone else has. The film itself is......wow. There really aren't that many films that make you feel like you are actually living the life of another individual alongside that person or persons, but this film does! The writing is absolutely great and realistic, with the characters' dialogue ingraining itself in your memory for days to come. It also paints an amazing and provoking story. Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) is a war hero who has just returned from service and looks to enter a MMA tournament, the prize of which is $5 million. At first, it appears that the reason he is doing this is just for pure activity and for fun, but it is eventually revealed that he wants to donate his prize to support the wife and children of his slain war buddy. The man has got some raw talent, due to the fact that his father, Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) trained him in wrestling and martial arts for many years when he was young. He appears at his father's house to ask for him to train him again, but you can tell right away that there is some turbulent history between these two, because of Paddy's former alcoholism and abusiveness towards his wife and children. Paddy is almost 1,000 days sober now and looks to make amends and seek real forgiveness with Tommy, who makes it perfectly clear he doesn't have a father and only needs a trainer. Meanwhile, Brendan Colon (Joel Edgerton), Tommy's brother, is also adept in fighting due to being a former professional UFC player. Now he's a family man with a beautiful and supporting wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and two daughters. He is having major financial problems and between him and his wife, they keep three jobs, with Brenden being a well-liked physics teacher at the local high school by day and a MMA fighter at a strip club parking lot event by night. Unfortunately, Brendan faces foreclosure on his house when he can't make ends meet because he gets suspended from his job when he keeps showing up to work with wounds and bruises. He decides the only way to fix things is to fight full-time, and eventually leads himself to the major tournament which his brother is also heading to. We learn over the course of the film that there are serious emotional issues between the two Conlon brothers and their father, and the film has many talky dramatic and extremely well-acted moments that reveal details and develop the journey for genuine retribution and forgiveness searched for by all three main characters. This is compunded when the brothers end up facing off with each other in the final match of the tournament and simultaneously draw the attention of an entire nation of people with their bout. The acting is absolutely incredible from every person involved and the level of realism that each person brings to their character is unbelievable. I have seen Tom Hardy being labeled as a young Marlon Brando, and it's easy to see why as he completely immerses himself in his role as a gritty tough-guy. He is definitely my favorite up-and-coming actor. Another favorite up-and-comer of mine is Joel Edgerton, who really makes you care for Brendan and sympathize with his troubles, but you also feel an amzing connection to both him and Tommy throughout the film. By far the most nuanced and well-acclaimed acting role in this film is that of Nick Nolte as Paddy who displays an amazing vulnerability and you really feel sorry for him as he strives to put all of his past mistakes right. Jennifer Morrison does a great job as Tess, Brendan's wife, and she really draws attention whenever she is in a scene. Gavin O' Connor's writing and directing also really make this film a triumph, and I hope he continues to make more films as soon as possible. The ending moments of the film are incredibly powerful and I found myself not knowing who I wanted to win the tournament out of the two brothers, but one of them does win, and Iwon't reveal who does obviously because you absolutely need to find that out for yourself when you watch the movie. Movies like \\"Rocky\\", \\"Raging Bull\\", and \\"The Fighter\\" are incredible peices of cinema, but in my personal opinion, I believe \\"Warrior\\" is a a movie that I enjoyed far more and I am labeling it my own personal favorite sports movie and it is the best movie period of 2011 so far. GO SEE IT!!! I have notified Amazon to tell me when the movie gets a release date for Blu-Ray so I can preorder it. I can't wait to add it to my collection!
B000000I0D|5.0|Fantastic album as good if not better than tubular bells, having listened to other Mike Oldfield albums this would be the best
1451629184|5.0|Although this book is heart wrenching, you will not be able to put it down. It is a quick read, but will make you feel ill and at times I wanted to throw up-it is not for the weak stomach. What this young woman had to endure is unspeakable, yet Jaycee has been able to do it. Not only did she write about this ordeal, she survived it and sounds like an amazing woman and Mom. Worth the read, although I haven't let my children out of my sight since starting it.
0691142165|4.0|The book is very graphically designed.  I have started it, but it is deep in thought and graphs and charts.  I will get through it, but will not be a fast read for me.  Overall, I have scanned it and feel like it  is a good book.  I hope it helps me to understand not only the historical part but today's gyrations in the  financial world as well as the political workings of an ineffective government.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|works great and entertaining. lots of times I need to keep playing cause it's addicting. love the game.. not much else that needs to be said for this product
B003UESJDI|5.0|I found this film on a really long flight home from Asia and started watching it because it looked easy on the brain. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be the best film that I've seen all year! The second surprise came when I read all the mixed Amazon reviews - it seems like half the world hates this, and the other half loves it.<br /><br />To make it easy for you, I think if you like Hollywood style romcoms you will probably hate this, and if you like British black humor, you will probably really like it. This is definitely not a Hollywood romcom. If you want something brainless with a lot of stereotypical characters and a predictable happy ending, then stop reading. It's also not it if you want to be uplifted or intellectually challenged - it's meant to be a social comedy, but the black humor kind, not the kind that offers a serious social critique. There's also lots of dialogue and very little action, and there are no major conclusions, so if you have short attention span and like tidy endings, this is not for you.<br /><br />So, why did I love this film? Well, as many other reviewers wrote, this is a social comedy set in rural England with plenty of British black humour and mediocre, real-to-life characters. Personally, I think this is the film's real charm. It displays life in all its beautiful-green-grass but nothing to do boredom - think Midsomer Murders - while showing all the life's little quirks and absurdities - bit like Amelie or the Secretary. All the characters are kind of likable, but kind of not: the main character, Tamara Drewe, has our sympathy because she grew up ugly and had to deal with all sorts of nastiness as a result, but at the same time she's arrogant and sleeps with people for all the wrong reasons. Her teenage love is likeable for his down to earth views, but despisable for his lack of ambition. The rockstar Tamara's engaged to is a louche character, but one that loves his dog and treats enamored teenage girls with respect. There's the budding writer who is a coward that lets someone die by accident, but who's just a really nice American guy. There are the obnoxious, pathetic, plain and bored teenage girls, but in the end you're sorry for them, 'cause if you lived in that village you would throw eggs at cars, too...<br /><br />Is this real life? YES!! People who are bored, not happy with their lives and otherwise unsatisfied with life do all sorts of stupid things, and that doesn't make them bad. It just shows how absurdly ridiculous, sad and sometimes funny life can be. I think the film shows this to perfection but in a really silly, tongue-in-the-cheek kind of way (e.g. super exaggerated teenagers, Tamara in really short shorts.) In my opinion, the best thing about it is that it doesn't treat the issues seriously but rather pokes fun at the mediocrity of life.  Plus the sets were gorgeous and the acting fabulous, particularly from the teenage girls. I lived in England for a long time and I just can't shake the feeling that the film holds up the mirror to British life rather well...
0062060554|3.0|Overall, I can only give this book 3 stars. The writing is good and the suspense builds with each page. But about 1/4 of the way through, I was pretty sure of what was going on. I kept reading, hoping I was wrong, because the author could have done something totally unexpected with the story. But I wasn't wrong. Then the plot goes from eerie to sordid. It's very easy to relate to Christine when she is suffering from memory loss...you understand the paranoia and confusion. But as she regains memory little by little, it is difficult to relate to the past Christine. The choices you realize she made are never fully explained and it was hard for me to understand why she did the things she did. The whole thing concludes too quickly...all that mounting suspense deserved more action and elucidation. And I was really hoping to see Christine gain some independence and save herself. But she doesn't and the ending is weak.
0312323867|4.0|I must admit, when I first started reading Something Blue, I did not think that I would enjoy it as much as I did Something Borrowed. I was pleased to discover that Emily Giffen did not paint Darcy as some heroine that everyone just misjudged in the previous reading. It was fitting, I thought that Darcy found herself alone from the way she acted. I was also surprised by the depth of the deception with her affair with Marcus.     I was a nice change that she left for Europe and made new friends. I also liked that she fell in love with Ethan, especially when in the beginning it looked like it would be a one sided love.I also loved the sequence of events that unfolded at the end of the book between Rachel, Dex, and Darcy.  I would recommend this book to anyone who fell in love with Something Borrowed.
0740745271|5.0|This is a great book. It's not just about improving your vision. It's about opening your mind and expanding your life. The enhancement of the 3d vision is a tool capable of developing your peripheral vision, that responds per reading almost 80 percent of all the (visual) information surrounding you. The practicing of your 3d vision gives you more physical balance, but it also connects you with your intuition and activates parts of your brain which are usually only marginally used. Never heard people saying human beings use only 10 percent of their brain capacity? Give yourself a chance of 'seing' more.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Fringe, simply put, is amazing.  I would compare it to a modern day X-Files with the freak science etc, but it appeals to a larger community with suspense, the humor, and sci fi.  Very well written and as the seasons have progressed the plot has thickened and we find that our characters are more intertwined than we could have imagined, always bringing me back for more.  I can't wait to see how the plot develops further.  Bravo to J. J. Abrams and the cast.
B0056NYMXC|4.0|It seems that Kelly has slipped into the Beyonce' Zone with this album, but for me, because it's her, I was more accepting of what she was offering and I liked it.  After 3 spins in my cd player, I can say that she has definitely come into her own with her music and production.  I just wished that she didn't rely so much on guest rappers to make up the majority of her release.  Her voice is strong and, judging by her first album, capable of so much more, but for what she gave, it definitely got the job done.  This disc has started off my mornings on my way to work and I can imagine somebody's Zumba class getting a complete workout if they're following these beats.  This was a solid effort by a solid artist.
B003JSSPSY|4.0|Legend of the Seeker: season 2 was good but doesn't keep track of the story, there are a lot of short story's and i couldn't keep track of everything. They kept on introducing new characters like his real dad, witches, the devil and a whole heap of characters. Then they go to alternate future and Cara becomes a lesbian, did i mention that Cara joins Richards team. Yep you read right, so you see what i mean. it was good but not great
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this for the cable, as much as for the controller.  Even though it implies it comes with a cable, \\"To Connect or Charge the Controller use the USB Cable\\", it does NOT come with a cable.  This controller works great and is fully compatible with the PS Three.
B000059TEQ|5.0|As good as I remember. I really like this movie because of the simpler times and focus. Until the end of course.
1451629184|4.0|Jaycee Dugard did an impresive job recounting a terrible ordeal. I wept and cheered for her as she went along, explaining time after time horrendous encounters. I hoped for her success in regaining her dignity and she did. Bravo to a brave woman and well told story. Thank you... Jennifer Stace
B00005OCEX|4.0|Seriously who hasn't heard the song \\"The Final Countdown\\"? It's such a memorable track (well for some) and it is still at sporting events around the world, on the radio and was a musical phenomenon around 1986-87. Originally released in 1986, Europe's breakthrough The Final Countdown was reissued in 2001 with new liner notes and three extra live tracks as a bonus. Besides the iconic title track, The Final Countdown had four other singles in the hard rocking \\"Rock The Night\\", the melodic \\"Cherokee\\", the power ballad \\"Carrie\\" and the excellent album closer \\"Love Chaser\\". This is Europe at the height of their fame, they did some good albums before but their commercial success reached peak with The Final Countdown. Europe's earlier albums, the self-titled Europe (1983) and Wings of Tomorrow (1984) were both heavier and were more guitar oriented albums. The band somewhat reinvented themselves with The Final Countdown going for catchy pop-like melodies, less aggressive and guitar oriented work and instead feature more keyboard and more friendly image. Sort of a departure musically but for the most part this idea worked very well for Europe and you have to admit they had come memorable tunes and epic keyboards to say the least.<br /><br />The biggest hit and most popular song from this album is obviously the title track, many people buying this album are doing so just because of this track. It remains Europe's best known song and I cannot imagine without going to see this band live without them performing this track.  The fantastic keyboards are what most people remember, such a catchy melody that stays in your head. Some people are tired of this song, some hate it but it reminds of a certain time in a good way.  \\"Rock The Night\\" is an excellent more upbeat rock song and perhaps my favorite song on The Final Countdown. It's a fun youthful anthem, very enjoyable Glam-Rock. \\"Carrie\\" is a power ballad done right, Joey Tempest's voice here is powerful and sounds excellent. I really like this ballad, it's emotional, majestic and there's just something about it that reaches me, not quite sure what it is though. \\"Cherokee\\" grabs you from the first keyboard melody and never lets you go. It's one of the best songs on TFC, listen to that chorus! \\"Love Chaser\\" is probably my least favorite out of the singles but it manages to close in nice fashion. I quite like the vocal harmonies of this one. As it turns out the singles released from TFC really are the best tracks of the album unlike some albums that have some truly underrated songs. The other songs are enjoyable to a certain degree like \\"Heart of Stone\\" that has certain likeability to it but for some reason I've never been able to get into \\"Danger on the Track\\" too pop for me and too repetitive. \\"Ninja\\" is probably my favorite out of the non-singles track; it features some nice guitar playing and a nice solo.<br /><br />The three bonus live tracks are a nice addition, I would've love on the other to have heard some demos or alternate versions like what the title track or \\"Rock The Night\\" initially sounded like. That would've been cool but any extras are nice although I would not recommend re-purchasing JUST for those live tracks. It's cool to hear The Final Countdown live, it's a good version from the Final Countdown tour and it works well although it doesn't quite have the effect of the studio version. \\"Carrie\\" is probably the best out of the live tracks; it's very powerful live and has an effect on the crowd. Tempest's voice is just as good live as on the studio version and it carries the song. \\"Danger on the Track\\" is the third and last live track but I won't comment on it since I'm not really a fan of this song. On a side note got to give props to the keyboardist, Mic Michaeli, for some work that's nothing short of epic. Joey Tempest in my opinion has one of the best voices in this genre and the rhythm section of bassist John Leven and drummer Ian Haugland. John Norum is a good guitaristand provides some good guitar playing and solo but is generally overshadowed by the keyboards on this album (he was unhappy with the direction the band took with this album and left soon after, he eventually came back).<br /><br />It's definitely a product of its time: catchy choruses, plenty of keyboards and nice melodies. It's what would often be called Glam/Hair/Pop- Metal or simply 80's metal. This is the Europe people generally remember.If you're looking for heavier types of Rock/Metal or if you simply don't like Glam and keyboards I would say stay away from this album, this is not what you're looking for. But if you like fun catchy 80's rock, with good melody and clear vocals I would recommend Europe. The Final Countdown is always a good starting point for new fans; it has the hits and popular songs and may very well be all the Europe you will ever need. If one wants to look further Europe also has some other good albums, I like their early work very much and their following albums \\"Out of This World\\" and \\"Prisoners in Paradise\\". Even their more recent albums such as \\"Start From The Dark\\" and \\"Last Look At Eden\\" have some good music on them. If you're into this type of music Europe will be a good addition to your collection, if not avoid! I'm not sure I could say it's their best album for sure but its surely the most popular and is regarded as the definitive Europe album after all. I know a lot of people like to hate on this music or laugh/make fun of it but I actually like Europe. 4/5 stars.e good guitar playing and solo but is generally overshadowed by the keyboards on this album (he was unhappy with the direction the band took with this album and left soon after, he eventually came back).    It's definitely a product of its time: catchy choruses, plenty of keyboards and nice melodies. It's what would often be called Glam/Hair/Pop- Metal or simply 80's metal. This is the Europe people generally remember.If you're looking for heavier types of Rock/Metal or if you simply don't like Glam and keyboards I would say stay away from this album, this is not what you're looking for. But if you like fun catchy 80's rock, with good melody and clear vocals I would recommend Europe. The Final Countdown is always a good starting point for new fans; it has the hits and popular songs and may very well be all the Europe you will ever need. If one wants to look further Europe also has some other good albums, I like their early work very much and their following albums \\"Out of This World\\" and \\"Prisoners in Paradise\\". Even their more recent albums such as \\"Start From The Dark\\" and \\"Last Look At Eden\\" have some good music on them.

B0055V6EZE|3.0|The best aspect of British actor and HOUSE star Hugh Laurie's debut CD -  a collection of New Orleans blues covers - is the quality of the instrumentations, with horn arrangements from the great Allen Toussaint; Laurie's piano licks are solid. The worst aspect? Laurie's high, nasally, thin, not terribly convincing voice - he sounds overly affected, like he's playing the role of a bluesman and not really believing it himself. (Especially painful: his strained take on \\"Tipitina\\". ) He's shown up for the wannabe that he is in the strongest track on the album: \\"Baby, Please Make a Change\\", featuring a stirring vocal from the still potent Sir Tom Jones, who at 71 could sing circles around posers like Laurie and a younger generation of aspiring pop stars. The album is pleasant enough - Laurie's duet with soulful Irma Thomas on \\"John Henry\\" is his best vocal effort here - but on the whole, it comes across as a vanity project that wouldn't have happened without considerable help from Laurie's vastly more experienced friends. For a taste of something more authentic, look up Toussaint's wonderful 2006 collaboration with another Brit - Elvis Costello  - THE RIVER IN REVERSE. If it's another star actor you want, Jeff Bridge's self titled new release finds the Oscar winner working with country-tinged material that perfectly matches his gruff, weathered-but-warm current persona. As for Laurie, there's no doubt that he's a sincere fan of the music he presents on LET THEM TALK. However, he comes across as better suited to Noel Coward patter songs and early 20th century novelty tunes than gritty, soulful New Orleans blues stylings. Next time, he'd be better off as just the pianist and let Sir Tom and others pick up all the vocal duties.
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|but this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I first saw it when it came out and I was 16 or so but it's still just as good as I remember.  John Grisham sure knows how to tell a story!  Very intense movie though...sure there are some light moments but for the most part it's a heavy hitter and will tug at your emotions, for different reasons!  Highly recommended.
B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|We often think of 1945 as the end of World War II, and the arrival of Allied troops into Berlin as the death-knell of Nazi-controlled Germany. However, some of the story continues, granted on a much smaller scale, such as the manhunts for people suspected of war crimes like Adolf Eichmann, and the recovery of stolen artwork and artifacts. Much of the atrocities at the hand of the Nazis before and during World War II still linger and affect people today, more than 65 years ago at this writing. \\"The Debt\\" is a partially fictitious story about how the events of the 1930's and 1940's still carries on today. The story which begins about 20 years after the war doesn't end until 1997.<br /><br />The film begins in 1997 with the publication of a book about three young Israelis 30 years earlier in the service of Mossad in the mid-1960's. The book has been written by the young daughter of one of the agents, the mother now in her 50s. Although this is supposed to be a joyous occasion, the mother appears ambivalent about the whole affair, which is one of the keys to understanding this film. Mossad is the Israeli equivalent of the CIA, and the three agents were engaged in a manhunt for Dr Vogel, the so-called \\"Surgeon of Birkenau\\", who tortured victims in medical experiments during the Nazi regime in Germany. Although Dr Vogel appears to be a fictional character, I would guess he is largely based on the real-life Dr Joseph Mengele, who engaged in horrible medical experiments at the death camps at the behest of the Third Reich. The three Mossad agents, Rachel Singer, Stephan Gold, and David Peretz, have vowed to kidnap Vogel whom they believe is practicing gynecology in East Berlin under communist occupation and extradite him to Israel to face trial, similar to the fate of Adolf Eichmann only a few years earlier. Vogel, if based on Mengele, would be in his mid-50's in 1965.<br /><br />The film then flashes back to 1965 when two of the three agents, Rachel and David, pass through \\"Check-Point Charlie\\", the crossing station separating East and West Berlin from 1961 until 1990. Now in East Berlin, they meet up with Gold to resolve to kidnap the doctor. Their mission has three components. They must verify their subject as being the Nazi doctor, they must figure out a way to kidnap him, and lastly, the three with their prisoner must escape back into West Berlin under the nose of East Berlin guards. During this time, people caught trying to escape to the West from the East could be either imprisoned or shot. Presumably, once in West Berlin, they will be met by other members of the Mossad who will take Vogel back to Israel and force him to stand trial for war crimes and murder.<br /><br />Interspersed between the events of 1965-1966 are the events of 31 years later in 1997. Two of the three original agents, Rachel Singer, played by Helen Mirren, and Stefan Gold, played by Tom Wilkinson, are finding that the past has caught up with them, and they must deal with the events of three decades earlier. Singer's daughter has written a book about these young agent's experiences in the 1960's, but as events unfold, it may turn out that not all the events as written are completely accurate.<br /><br />An outstanding and mesmerizing tale of suspense and political intrigue, one of the best I have seen in recent years. The three younger actors, Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas, and Sam Worthington play the younger versions of the agents, are really at the heart of the film and deserve as much credit as their older counterparts. As a pure action-suspense thriller, it can't be beat. As a political statement about the horrors of the holocaust, its one of the most compelling I've seen in such an offering in quite a few years. Just be warned that this is not escapist's fair.rlie\\", the crossing station separating East and West Berlin from 1961 until 1990.

0307454541|4.0|I came to this book, not so much through the enthusiasm of my friends, but through [[ASIN:1605981745 Stieg Larsson: Our Days in Stockholm]], a story of the author's friendship with a colleague and business partner.  I was intrigued and curious as to how a genuine human rights activist, not (yet) a world famous one, but a strong and stalked one, would handle a work of popular fiction.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The book has a slow start and a rushed finish.  In the middle there is a good plot and some of the characters are very well developed.  The book is worthy of the praise (and sales) accorded to it.<br /><br />The author's point of view comes through. His views of the violence against women, not only weave in the plot, but also through the facts on assaults against women that introduce that each of the book's four parts. Larsson's experience of being ominously threatened by right wing extremists comes through in the development of the characters of the former Nazis in this book.<br /><br />For mysteries you expect some degree of character exaggeration, but I believe Larsson goes overboard with both Martin Vanger and Lizabeth Salander. None of this gets in the way of the good story.  I stayed up to 2 am to solve the mystery of Harriet and woke early the next day to see the resolution of the other plots.<br /><br />Larsson can be forgiven the weaknesses, since he's delivered a page turner.  I will read the sequels which have been touted (by my friends) as equally good.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|It was bigger than I pictured from the picture on the site (and the price). That's actually a good thing since, I've heard, size is very important. I've had the bag for several months, and I carry around my Canon T2i and some lenses and a small tripod, along with some other stuff. It works very well. The first time I really used it was when my family and I went on Spring Break vacation to Oklahoma (Yes, people do sometimes vacation in Oklahoma. I was as surprised as anyone to learn this). I packed it up with my camera, and my wife's Nikon, and a bunch of lenses, and the chargers for everything, and my little pocket camera that I sometimes like to use, and some other stuff. It held everything with room for more, and it all felt well protected without being too heavy or bulky to carry around.    And when I got home, I thought I unpacked it. Flash forward to a few months later, and I want to charge up my seldom-used pocket camera. I look everywhere for the charger and cannot find it anywhere. I even looked in the Amazon camera bag, but I came up empty. A couple of days later, I decided to look everywhere again. Checking the camera bag again, I opened a pocket I had forgotten was there and found the missing charger. So either somebody is messing with my head (a distinct possibility), or the camera bag has a lot of places to store stuff and then forget about.

0553801473|1.0|I am very disappointed of this fifth book. I gave GRRM the chance with his forth slow and stumbling book because he describe his intention to have 2 books with simultaneous chronological stories just separated by geography. Many story lines unfinished more created...<br /><br />What it seem to me this last books, 4 and 5,  were just a way to make the story longer just to sell more. I had mix feelings while I enjoy parts of the book it dragged painfully. I will not recommend this book. GRRM became Terry Goodkind and his 13 book of the Seeker... An story that could have been so much more just as this one.<br /><br />My last hope is Christopher Paolini...<br /><br />Now we have to wait 5 years for the 6th book... My expectations are not high.
B00596WEVI|3.0|Caught this at a theater nearby and I have to say that I did enjoy this. It wasn't great or even \\"really good\\" but it was better than most of JCVD's other dtv movies(excluding US3 and Replicant)...and better than some of his later theatrical movies(Street Fighter,Double Team,Knock Off, Unisol:The Return). I think putting it on the same level as Wake of Death is pretty fair. I actually may have liked this a little more since it didn't feature the dopey MTV edits that WOD had. The acting was pretty solid all around for the most part. JC's son, Kris' character(Schell) was extremely pointless in my opinion...not to mention he sucked in it. Felt like he was reading his lines the entire movie. I really liked JC and Adkin's chemistry together. They played off each other really well but I was left wanting to see more of them sharing the screen. There were a few aspects I didn't care for but I don't want to spoil anything. Production wise, the movie looks pretty good considering the budget. It's well directed and shot. Good music score too. However, I actually feel like it would have made for a better at home experience than a theatrical one. The sepia tone actually looked a little blurred on the big screen during some of the wide shots...and I did find myself craving a little color. Close ups looked good though. All in all, it was a pretty good movie. This gives me hope for The Butcher. If Ernie Barbarash had a little more money to work with, he'd do a hell of a job. 3.25/5

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This movie is as good as it gets in the movie world as far as emotion, music, acting, inspiration, special effects, stunts, stoty and much more gets. This is one to be watched many times and enjoyed each time. Its on a different level to the huge majority of films and the religious element is minimal. Whats more its based on a true story. Life changing, inspirational, fun and deeply moving throughout the whole film. Brilliant.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|I've seen several Saoirse Ronan movies (Atonement, Death Defying Acts, The Lovely Bones) but this one is by far my favorite. All of these movies are completely different from one another, requiring a different set of acting skills, yet Ronan is mesmerizing in them all. She has an acting range that is breathtaking to watch. The best way to enjoy this movie is to sit back, accept everything that you see without question, and enjoy the performances, especially that of Ronan. The script does suffer from some glaring credibility issues, but don't let that interfere with your enjoyment of the movie. Cinematography is superb under the masterful eye of Joe Wright's direction. He gets more mileage out of subtle facial expressions than any other director I've seen in a long long time.  The soundtrack by The Chemical Brothers is also superb and complements the action beautifully. Overall, one of the best 111 minutes you'll ever spend.

0547791097|2.0|Regardless of how excited I am to still see the new movie version, the novel is really bad. It has no story, and is a hugely inferior copy of Andrew Vachss' amazing prose style, and Bret Easton Ellis' structure of American Pyscho.   I am hugely disappointed with every aspect of this novel, save the length. If a novel is going to bore and infuriate you, best that, like this one, it only takes you 90 minutes to read.

B005COO1X6|3.0|Mile 81 refers to a closed rest area on I-95 in Maine.  And as it goes in Stephen King's world, it's a place where Very Bad Things happen.  King has always done pretty well writing kids.  His slang might be kind of out of date (or maybe it's just more regional), but the basic kid-ness of the character is usually spot-on.  The character of Pete Simmons is one of King's better kids and his portion of the story is the best part.<br /><br />In fact, if the story had ended before the whole killer-car thing then I'd probably rate it much higher.  I don't think I'm blowing the plot by mentioning the killer-car, but yeah.  There's been some ink spilled about how this is kind of a return to King's early, grittier days - but I don't agree.  The \\"villan\\" of the story seems more mystical than plain evil.  Like there's some kind of unexplored method or reason for what it does.  I get that this is a short story or novella, but the randomness of the evil doesn't add anything to the story, so it just felt like there needed to be more investigation into what the deal was with this car.<br /><br />The first section (focusing on Pete Simmons) is pretty good, but the rest is just kind of paint-by-numbers with a rushed ending.  All build and no pay-off.<br /><br />Also - 20% of this e-book is the preview for 11/22/63 - so the story is even shorter than it appears.

We want the original, unaltered theatrical cut of Star Wars! we want it despite its aging, despite it's now evident flaws, but also with the great effects, quotes, and music, scenes that made us dream!!!      I cannot understand what George Lucas is making with his classic movies. Maybe he needs to keep some of his companies working, otherwise it does not make sense at all.    Making all these senseless changes is something not acceptable. Please take them back.    I don't mind what he does with his recent trilogy because I did not like it at all, but I really mind when someone messes with classic movies, and when he does not give us the chance to watch them the way they were meant to be watched. The way they were shown at the theaters for the first time. The way we love them.    I can only quote what George Lucas himself said, not so long ago, in this very same world....    \\"People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.    In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.    Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.\\"    -- George Lucas's 1988 speech to the U.S. Congress

B003L77GGK|2.0|I'm a huge supernatural fan. I loved seasons 1-5 and the ending to 5 was amazing. i wasn't sure how they were going to pick up season 6 but i was optimistic and while there was some potential at first the season quickly deteriorated into uninteresting schlock. the change in creative direction was obvious from the get to. a lack of the impala, less rock & roll, more touchy feely sensative crap. in a single season we had 6 or 7 \\"elseworlds\\" or \\"what if\\" episodes. i get it, once you've done the end of the world where do you go from there? but casting a mediocre looking actress as eve is a departure from the slew of beautiful babes that populated the series till now. killing her off so quickly really was a waste. the death of rufus was mostly useless and i was hoping for more from samuel. the original feel and humor is there it's just much more subdued than in previous seasons. though for the last 5 or so episodes, starting right about at the pheonix one, there is an upturn in quality and we see a very interesting plot twist at the end. so i'm actually really excited for the next season but this one i wasn't really impressed with. i'd go so far as to recomend a pass on it. don't bother with this one.
0553801473|4.0|Enjoyable as always.  People craving resolution will be disappointed, though; there are few answers here, and many more questions.  Essential to those following the series, but I wouldn't recommend it if you haven't read the preceding books.

B004GUSG4M|4.0|The book was slow to start; because the story is told from Christine, the amnesiac's point of view, the beginning is a bit repetitive. It's not until the second half of the book that things start to pick up. You, like Christine, don't always know what is real and what isn't. As she keeps a journal, the book starts to pick up pace, as the content of the journal acts as memory pushing the story forward. The ending was climactic, and I did not see the twist as it played out. (I thought something different, but similar). All in all, I enjoyed it, and would be happy to read this author again.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|From the perspective of a 5-year-old, this is a story like we have never read before. I finished in just two days. I am not a fast reader, but I was with this story.

Lois Lane also discovers that Clark Kent is Superman. We get to see Superman trying to survive without his superpowers. And Lex Luthor, played with excellence by Gene Hackman, provides the humor in this movie.<br /><br />I also enjoyed very much in this two-disc edition the Flescher series of Superman. I didn't know that these existed. These episodes are from the 40s and from the post Pearl Harbor attack. Most of them make direct references to WWII. These shorts are done in noirish style. The stories are told with simplicity. Lois Lane is always getting in trouble through her journalistic investigations and Superman is always rescuing her. The soundtrack used for these cartoons is also great to build tension.<br /><br />This was a good edition.

0062112430|4.0|After the dystopian phenomena that is The Hunger Games and the forbidden romance Twilight, it is easy to see why this book would be successful.  Dystopian plus a Romeo-Juliet complex? A beautiful formula.    I will start off by saying I enjoyed this book.  It is a beautiful novel and well worth reading.  However, one small flaw was the lack of depth to Alex.  Besides the forbidden love, why does Lena want him?  His knowledge about the world as it was, or is there something in him?  The second flaw is the world itself.  Why would society abolish love?  It is the single most written about, sung about, thought about emotion.  Psychology revolves around it and despite the issues it creates, it is inconcievable that it could be abandoned.    The pure beauty and romance of the book overpower the faults.  It's a wonderful read and a good story that has the ability to be a psychological thriller or a twisting tragedy.  I look forward to the continuation.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|I adored this book. I was in love with this book. It took me several days to even think about reading another one after I finished it...it was one of THOSE kinda books.

B004NSULHM|4.0|Radiohead has been one those \\"hit or miss\\" bands for a long time. But I give them credit for trying something new, not worrying about being popular. Consequently, there is an album like \\"King of Limbs\\".    In my opinion, this is the best album that Radiohead has put together in a long time. My favorite: Lotus Flower. I love the way the music lingers in a room, flowing in and out. Most of the songs are like this. I agree that this CD is not for everyone, but it shouldn't be for a mass audience. It seems like it was designed for small groups.    King of Limbs is worth your time and money..

In fact, it was the first classic I ever read and, like so many lovers of particular books, I read the book every year.  It doesn't lose anything.    I have issues with the negative views.  1) why in the world would anyone buy a movie without seeing it in the theatre first?  2) I would like to remind all those who hold it as a \\"great love story\\", that the book isn't just about a love story, it's about a woman who breaks with almost all standards of the time.  She seeks her independence, she takes her life into her own hands and accepts the reprocussions, even when it goes badly (like wandering off into the moors without a hint of where to go).  She does not harber hatred or grudges and moves beyond them into a quiet, almost Zen-like, grace of being.  She is intelligent and makes on excuses for that intelligence.  She wants Rochester, but only on her own terms and only when she can meet him as an equal and will not compromise her position, even when it may leave her with nothing.      Yes, it's gothic and dark.  Yes, the moral compass of our beloved characters are, at times, very questionable.  Even Jane's.  However, what we have is a very human person.  Someone we can relate to.  In fact, ALL the characters have something in each of them that we can all relate too.  Even poor Bertha, in her mad, instinct driven way is human and real.    This movie does not disappoint.  Those that say it is void of emotion, I have to wonder if we watched the same film.  Those that compare the Timothy Dalton version (because the woman playing Jane is totally forgettable and so cardboard); The original with Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine (classic Hollywood, so not near the book) - all these have their good points but frankly, they all lack something and leave out amounts.      This movie is the closest to the book.  There is more than enough emotion FOR THE TIME PERIOD.  Remember that thiswas the Victorian Era.  The fact that Jane is as independent as she is, is almost unheard of.  A great deal of versions leave out St John River and his sisters.  And frankly, the idea that Jane is actualy related to people that she JUST HAPPENS to run into in the middle of the moor, in the middle of the night, in an area she has never been, has always seemed SO out there (Charlotte Bronte would have been better to state that Jane was going to an area that her parents and family lived in and she was going to go back there and start a new life - then it would have been believable).  Frankly, this movie does a better job.  and Mia is FANTASTIC as Jane.  Just pretty enough to not be confused with the help, and yet plain enough to stand out amoung Rochester and his friends.      Great movie; Great Actors; Fantastic adaptation.  The only way to make this better?  Make it 3.5 hours long!  The story could only be better as a 2 or 3 part mini-series.    (And for the person who compared the new adaptation of Pride and Prejudice to Jane Eyre - I would like to remind you that Austen and Bronte lived many decades apart; lived in totally different family dynamics; had completely different outlooks on life; and in fact, Charlotte Bronte was not a fan of Jane Austen.  And frankly, the new adaptation of Pride and Prejudice was not great.  When you have a period drama, you need to remain period.)
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Just to support the movement.  Everybody has said it all.  George you need to stop. Stop messing with what was perfect as it was.  I would prefer if you never remastered them them at all.  I'm happy with my VHS copies.
B0059IVV9M|4.0|Was never much interested in Beirut after reading reviews, but a friend convinced me that this was worth me checking, and wow was he right. Fantastically original and unique instrumentation and arrangement for an 'indie rock' band, nice melodies and what sound like on first few listens to be very good introspective lyrics. As a point of reference I guess I'd say it would be kind of like the National meets Arcade Fire but throwing in some chamber music instruments, but that's really not totally accurate, it's more original than that, but if you like either of those bands I'd find it hard to imagine you not liking Beirut! Going to have to hit the back catalog now!!
1402726899|2.0|Many of the other critical reviews are spot on; this book is geared towards practice in an Iyengar yoga studio, and is best used by someone who has experience with Iyengar yoga. As a 10 year practitioner of Iyengar yoga I came in expecting that, but knowing how to easily adjust poses for an environment with much less equipment. Yet still, I had serious problems with it.    First, many many simple poses are, in this book at least, contraindicated for the first trimester, claiming that they'll cause miscarriage or restrict the growth of the fetus. Paschimottonasana springs immediately to mind. This contradicts the pregnancy section in Yoga: A Gem for Women and I found the repeated \\"not for use in 1st trimester\\" really intimidating and scary. Even though I knew better, I couldn't practice yoga for a week after reading this book because I was too scared (ok, and had a bit of morning sickness).     Second, it tries to be a general pregnancy book when it really shouldn't. The general info is too sparse or not well backed up by the research, and the authors make no effort to show where they get their information from. For instance recommending an ayurvedic diet for pregnancy with no consideration of the variety of maternal needs I found particularly annoying.     The worst of it though was that is suggests how to have a \\"yogic\\" birth. First, historically yoga was a male activity, so there is no tradition of yogic birth. Secondly, while yoga can certainly help with a natural birth the suggestions they had were way too quiet and passive (without the support of, say, hypnobirthing training). I really don't think yoga teachers should be telling women how to push, but these do.    This books is large, comprehensive, and well-illustrated, but I believe the Iyengar practitioner is far better served by Yoga: A Gem for Women.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Lady Gaga was born to slay!  This highly anticipated album truly lives up to the hype. From the very first track, Marry the Night, Gaga sets the listener up for the ride of a lifetime. Stand out tracks include Scheisse, Bloody Mary, and Heavy Metal Lover, but with constant hard beats and catchy hooks, Born This Way is a great listen from beginning to end.
B003FSTN52|5.0|I was rolling my eyes everytime the preview for this show was aired.  I refused to watch it.  I couldn't stand the thought of a woman standing by her man like Hilary Clinton did for Bill.  However, a reviewer for TV Guide who consistently gives good reviews to shows I like kept promoting it, so this summer I rented it at the video store.  I am really glad I did. WOW!  The sublties the lead actress is able to portray in just a look is amazing.  All that supressed rage is just there below the surface.  The law show's supporting cast is also always great to watch, too.  There are a lot of favorite actors from other shows that appear on this show.  Although the Good Wife is the star and the main reason I watch, the other players on the show add to the depth of the show.  Alan Cummings joining the cast was a nice bonus, too.  Now I'm dying to watch season 2 before the next season airs.
B004UUKDNA|3.0|That's interesting, have you ever seen a cross between a shark and a mouse? Me neither, but it seems 'alternative' has quietly forgiven 'disco', after years of divisiveness and contempt, and has, rather discreetly, joined forces.    Add to that a bunch of kids who think they're the next Freud (or is it Houdini) give their take on how the world could be a better place. Thankfully, they did that to a tastefully up-beat soundtrack with sing-a-long choruses. Well, I didn't actually sing-a-long but it seemed as though a lot of people were 'singing along' to the choruses.     They're not particularly memorable at either singing or song-writing. Neither is there any strong, visible persona. Not that every musicians should be a pants-lost male-nympho egomaniac. They're agreeable nature generally gives way to a faceless sense.     But the whole 'air' of the thing is of warm-fuzzy community spirit and enjoyment, and isn't that what music should be about? Rating ***
B000002GK1|3.0|BADmotorfinger is BAD. It's angry and screaming and heavy from beginning to end. No let-up really; from anger to despair and back to anger again. Well perhaps this album wasn't meant to be one of surprises.<br />They're exemplary songwriting skills deliver unforgettable, fierce rockers like 'Rysty Cage', 'Somewhere' and 'Slaves and bulldozers', while the addition of horns on a couple of the tracks, like the rave-up 'Drawing Flies', is a welcome addition.<br /><br />But, as this album drags towards the hour mark, it could appear that rock music was meant to be more fun than this fairly slow album, even if it kicked along with some serious attitude (translate: energy). Albums such as Nirvana's 'Bleach' are just more fun, even if this is more accomplished, so it's about three stars.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I ordered this movie for our grandkids.   We had seen the previews and they expressed an interest in the movie.   Rio has become their favorite movie of the season.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|runs great on Toshiba thrive and nook color with manual nooter, would be nice if it was a little longer
B00000JNOJ|5.0|One word to describe this unplugged recording is intimate. Instead of Muddy Waters at a loud, crowded Chicago club, this is Muddy sitting across from you in some living room in Mississippi. I could really appreciate the nuanced vocals so much more. I heard \\"Big Leg Woman\\" on Youtube, checked out some other cuts and had to have the full recording.

0375842209|3.0|I'm a \\"lightweight\\" reader.  I generally go for books (anything from simple fantasy, to action and adventure) that don't coincide with our world , or anything too close to home, and certainly without a lot of heavy undertones, because books are a nice escape from reality.  Occasionally I will delve into more modern fiction to add variety to my \\"diet\\"<br /><br />The book thief is definitely a \\"heavier\\" book. For what it was, it was excellent, for a reader like me, it was good, but I probably wont read it again any time soon, despite having thought it a well written novel<br /><br />I have gone back and forth on my rating for this book.  For a reader like me, its 3 stars, because despite being well written, its not one that I will pick up when needing my \\"book fix\\".  If you like heavier novels that really make you think, and that are based in the real world, bump this up to 4 stars. (I still debate my own 3 start rating of it, because it was a good book)<br /><br />The book is definitely not for a younger audience, older teens and up.  The book is based in the WWII time frame, so you can imagine why I say that (antisemitism, bombs and deaths, families torn, fear of expressing anything that isn't Nazi-ism).  That said, for being based in Nazi Germany, its not overwhelming. It was well written, taking me from frustration, to sorrow, to enjoyment, and so on, with the characters.  I got attached to the characters (which may be why I didn't like it as much since a book like this inevitably has sorrow)<br /><br />In summary, this is not a feel good story, if you want a book to kick back and forget your cares, this is probably not going to fit the bill. However, if you are looking for a fiction based in reality, with real world themes, that is well written, this is an excellent book. As mentioned above, I wont be re-reading it soon, but I do think that it was worth the read
B002ZG994U|5.0|Holds true to the original storyline but with a fresh plot only rampage could take mr t's place.  I saw it not expecting much and left overwhelmed the best remake in years, maybe ever.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|I will start out by saying, I don't like movies with lots of sex, nudity, cursing, violence, etc. Consequently I was debating watching this movie, because it certainly could have swung that way. It didn't, much to my delight. Oh there is violence, guns chase scenes (but so do all action movies), but thankfully, it stopped there, no blood splattering all over, no gruesome injuries. There was romance, The \\"worst\\" two scenes were in the hotel, where Jolie is getting undressed and you see her underwear (which covered a good deal more than most swimsuits), and also where Depp dreams he goes into her room and begins to make out with her (this scene is brief). Thats about it.  There is cursing, but its not so prevalent (that I remember) as to make me reject the movie based on that.<br /><br />Basically, its an action movie, chase scenes, gun fire, mobsters.  There is romance and attraction.  The plot is fun and engaging.  (and it was rather fun to see favorite actors from other movies) Its clean enough that I will watch it again.<br /><br />---------<br /><br />If you are like me and wonder about the \\"appropriateness\\" of movies search for \\"kids-in-mind\\".  Its a movie review website that has VERY thorough rankings and will list in detail (if you are interested) all the reasons they give a movie the score they do.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Love the movie first time watching it I loved it way.. way .. different from todays movies a nice change.
0071762345|5.0|I have read about a dozen or so social media books. I manage a restaurant in South Jersey, The Pop Shop and over the past year or so we have been determined to have a great social media community for our customers. This book provided me with new ideas, new prospectives on day to day situations and most importantly how to be likeable. I would and will recommend this for beginners and businesses that have been using social media for years. A great book!
B000FZETKC|4.0|The cover of this movie was a little more worn than what I was hoping but the movie played perfect and that is what is most important. I am happy with my purchase.
B003XQRZ7E|3.0|Glenn Hughes sounds like he's been on the shelf for a bit, can't quite hit it all.... songs are ok to good.... obviously very Deep Purple/Robin Trower/insert other 70's Brit rockers here-- ish. The 2nd album is much stronger overall, I think they needed to get this one out of the way as a learning experience (or re-learning experience for Hughes). I give Hughes credit for just doing it....at 58 or 59, definitely more balls than all the members of the Stones put together.
1601252463|5.0|I was very, very, very, very, very, very, very, happy. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
B004RSCWZ2|2.0|.... this is what it would sound like.  I must have received the French version of th CD or something, because it doesn't rock, at all. Based on other reviews, and Trucks' lineage, I bought this...... I kept waiting for the rock part of the \\"blues/rock\\" to kick in, but it doesn't. I kept waiting for Trucks to burn it up on the slide, it didn't happen. I would say that 70% of the guitar work on this album I could play myself, and I am not that good. A very slow, drawn out affair. I will now return to listening to my old Ian Moore CD's, from before he cut his hair....
0375826742|5.0|I am presently reading Eldest which is the second book of the series. Brisingr arrived in excellent condition and sooner than I had expected. I am very satisfied.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Mamoru Hosoda's previous film, THE GIRL WHO LEAPT THROUGH TIME, was a masterpiece. However, his SUMMER WARS is even better due to it's complexity, depth, fascinating characters, and its mind-blowing visuals. In my opinion, Mr. Hosoda has done something I didn't think possible - he's almost (a few more movies of this quality will lock it in) reached the same exalted level as Hayao Miyazaki.    I strongly recommend that you view all the films by Miyazaki and Hosoda in the original Japanese (with subtitles) if you're not watching with a small child. If you can't read, this is a good time to learn. I view all dubbing, no matter how well done, to be an insult to the actors and the director, and it always diminishes the film's overall effect.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Soul Searcher is a great book.  A true story of such courage after a tragic assident.  Very heart warming.     Fast service from Amazon.  I got it faster than I expected.
B005COO1X6|2.0|I can't believe no one else has yet commented on the formatting of this little nugget. Right now there's a huge uproar in the publishing world with the ease of self-publishing on Kindle and other e-reading devices. The biggest argument against tends to revolve around poor editing and poor formatting, with the naysayers claiming that only the Big 6 publishers could provide \\"quality\\" e-book editing and formatting, and that they serve as getekeepers of good taste.     I pre-ordered this book and got my copy on the day of release. I was appalled at the terrible formatting. Is this the best quality level that a Big 6 publisher like S&S can manage? Chapter breaks don't appear at new screen clicks, line spacing isn't sufficient at section breaks within a chapter, the dedication line even appears at the end of the story without a line break so it looks like the last line of the story...   Abysmal. Absolutely pathetic. The editing left a bit to be desired as well (and yeah, I've read of enough of King to know when he's being colloquial and when his copy editor goofed up).    As for the story, many of the reviewers here have it dead on: if you love your Uncle Stevie (like I do), you'll eat this up. You'll be disturbed by the quick ending and the weak plot device around which it revolves. You'll enjoy the thrills up to that point, but after the let-down ending, you'll start more critically examining the rest and finding more and more to complain about. I enjoyed the story til the ending, but ultimately was left unsatisfied. As far as the gatekeepers of good taste argument above, people have been saying for years that King could publish his laundry list. I've defended against that line for years as a fan. Some of his work wasn't as good as other pieces, but I felt it all had merit. This story starts out well, but doesn't really go anywhere. An editor worth their salt should have told King that and made him reconsider the ending.    I hate to leave a bad review for something (Irarely do) and I hate to leave a bad review for an author I like a lot, but the formatting and editing on this story bought my rating down to 2 stars. If it had been better packaged, I might have gone to 3.5 stars for story. Not his best work, but still plenty entertaining. If you are a die hard King fan, you'll read it anyway. If not, this one might not be the best starting point for you.
0061433047|3.0|I awaited the publishing of this book as others have, with real eagerness. And I felt disappointed from the beginning.    Two admissions up front: I'm a big fan of Mr. Pratchett's writing. I struggle to find writing as taught and freighted as his. And I prefer the books (like Monstrous Regiment, Going Postal, and Night Watch) that proceed at a quicker clip.    I find this book lacking in both those respects. I can't say that I love Mr. Pratchett's sharp writing in one breath and say that the writing in this book meets his standard in the next. There were glimpses of the brilliant wit and incisive dialogue I love. But they didn't make up as much of the book as they do in his best work.    And I agree with other reviewers who said the plot seemed to ramble. Again, the entire episode in Anhk Mohrpork didn't make much sense. It's not clear that Tiffany accomplished anything except reintroducing a popular character and setting up a touching ending. That's charming in some ways, but it doesn't make for a crisp storyline.    In a lot of ways, this book read like a multi-dimensional final episode of Happy Days - more intent on bringing together every notable character and tying up any loose than weaving moments of sharp insight and revealing action into a compelling story. In the entirety of the first chapter, for example, Tiffany walks across a fair grounds towing her broom, and has a conversation with a couple of kids. The rest of the chapter is given over to her musings on what it has meant to be a witch.    In the first chapter of \\"Going Postal\\", by comparison, the hero tries to escape prison, anticipates a reprieve, is hanged, is recruited by Vetinari, escapes, is hunted down, and is brought back. For my money Going Postal has a lot to say about human nature as well, and does much more of it through action rather than reflection. That makes it a much more enjoyable book for me.    In short, I enjoyed \\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\". But the slower pace, and meandering plot make it a book I won't revisit soon.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|This is not Star Wars: The Original Trilogy. It is a derivative work, with most of the original material, but you will also encounter different visual and audio effects, music, script, and actors. Certain character arcs, dramatic beats, and major story points have been altered. Two of the films were modified without the director's control or assent. See my review of [[ASIN:B003ZSJ212 Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray]]] for further discussion.    I give this set one extra star because it is not weighted down by the lugubrious prequels. The extra star should not be construed as advice that you purchase this set.    BTW, Amazon seems to have conflated this review with various other Star Wars reviews. I don't know how they manage to sell people the things they click on, yet mix the reviews up so badly. Anyway, in case you still can't tell, this is for the 2011 Blu-ray Original Trilogy box set.
1597801585|5.0|This is one of the most impressive dystopian SF novels that I have ever read, but it does start as slowly as any great book that I have ever encountered. There is no question that the book builds the story slowly in order to build up the social and political and economic background to the book - describing, in fact, a world where the economic has swallowed up the political and determines the social. As a result there is an unusual degree of depth to the book.<br /><br />Bacigalupi also builds the title character slowly, not even introducing her until fairly far into the novel, and only building her potential as a character that could carry a franchise until well over two-thirds into the novel. The climax of the novel is enormously entertaining and the end is as exciting as the beginning is slow.<br /><br />I don't know of any novel that recreates the future so completely and the literary qualities of the novel are so high, that it has pretty much instantly joined the list of the greatest dystopian novels ever written. For instance, in the 2011 anthology edited by John Joseph Adams, BRAVE NEW WORLDS, the \\"For Further Reading\\" section at the back lists a number of dystopian novels, indicating those with the highest literary merit by an asterisk. THE WINDUP GIRL is far and away the most recent novel to receive an asterisk on the list, the next most recent being Cormac McCarthy's THE ROAD. It is also one of those rare SF novels that is receiving considerable interest outside the SF community.<br /><br />This is not, however, a novel for those readers who are not especially literate. It is going to be a challenge for less advanced readers. But its merits were too substantial for any book to beat it for the Nebula or Hugo Awards. If a book this extraordinary doesn't win those awards, they should simply eliminate them. This extraordinary novel represents SF at its very best. And like Lev Grossman in his blurb used on the book's cover, I hope he writes a string of sequels.
1466208686|5.0|On an onsite interview with Google, I got one of the questions straight from the book. And other 3 questions that were asked I could relate to topics inside of the book. At another startup, I was asked more or less similar kind of questions from the book. I think this book does not guarantee you to getting an offer from the top companies but at the very least, it gets you into the mindset of the interviewers and think accordingly. It gets your mind thinking in the way that recruiters love. Do not think much, JUST BUY IT!!     Before this book came out, I thought Programming Interviews Exposed is a good reference but now I consider this book to be the ONE. Buy it and you will see for yourself. You will be more confident in your interviews and reading through the book will give you the satisfaction of having prepared for the interview. By far, the best book I have ever read on technical interviews!
B005COO1X6|3.0|I'm surprised at how well-reviewed this is. The story was not especially interesting or unique -- there's even a reference by one of the characters in this story to the movie Christine, a sad reminder that this is just a lazy rehashing of a classic by the same author. I guess you can't blame a famous writer for wanting to coast on his celebrity.  Still, the story is just not engaging.    And worse yet...while as I reader I'm generally willing to suspend disbelief, especially when reading Sci Fi or Horror, these characters just never sounded convincing to me.  Put simply, I found it easier to believe that a station wagon was actually a tentacled space alien than to believe that the dialogue attributed to Rachel would ever actually be uttered by a six year old girl.    Stephen King can, and has, done much, much better.  Save your money.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Wow! Where do I start? This is such an awesome book from start to finish that I could not stop reading it. I lost a lot of sleep staying up late to finish just a few more pages. The author gives an outstanding explanation of BUD/S and the SEAL finishing schools. He has a nact for painting a perfect picture with great detail of a situation. Like a SEAL should. This is by far the best book about combat fighting in Afghanistan that I have read. The adversity these warriors faced is beyond comprehension and a true testiment to what our elite warriors are made of. Mr. Luttrell and his fallen brothers are true heros and the finest America has to offer. Read this book!
0345529057|4.0|I ordered this box set for $20 instead of getting the first novel for more than half of that off Amazon, and banked on enjoying the books enough to warrant the buy. I've finished the first 4 in the series and I'm hooked: nobody is safe, the character development is well done, and the series never lets you down when it comes to twists, turns, and scheming.    That being said, this is not your typical fantasy. There are no flashy magic spells, nor any legendary weapons or anything of that sort. This is first and foremost a story about people and ambition, and the lengths to which people will go to achieve their ends. When an author can introduce a character that his readers loathe to begin with, and then make them love that character, that is quite a feat. The reading here can be tedious at times: there are SO many names, faces, places, and Houses you are apt to get lost once or twice. But if you can look past the congestion, it's really a great story being told.    In parting, I would have rated this particular product a 5, but the packaging leaves something to be desired. If you're one of those people who prefers to keep things like boxed sets together, I don't think there is anything on God's green earth that can get these books back into the little box they came in without causing some sort of damage. I didn't run into the problem so many other people seemed to with missing pages or out of order contents. Whether you buy this set or not, find a way to read these books.    \\"The King in the North!\\"
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Seriously addicted to this game. Extremely challenging on some levels, but hours of fun puzzle solving. Hope more levels are released in the future!
B00003CXAT|4.0|Hard to imagine few movies as fun as JURASSIC PARK.  I had fun when I first saw this Spielberg offering in the theater, and I have grand fun every time I catch it on cable.  I have an eclectic DVD collection, and this movie needs to be a part of it, so there will be a parting with my coin in the near future.  Outside of the suspense, the sheer terror of running for your life from a T-Rex or a raptor, it was, and still is, the (then) state-of-the-art CGI effects that make this thriller so special.  And I still get goose bumps every time I see that puddle of water shake from the approaching steps of a mean-tempered predator.<br /><br />The cast is exceptional, but I especially enjoy Jeff Goldblum as a free-spirited science ethicist; his one-liners and zingers are priceless.  Wayne Knight is the rotund villain we all love to hate, and who isn't entertained by a chain-smoking Samuel L. Jackson pecking away on a keyboard?  Yes, the cast is stellar, but the dinosaurs steal this movie, gobbling up (pardon the pun) every scene they're in.  The effects are as terrifying as they are believable, even after all these years and subsequent technological enhancements; who knew hiding in a kitchen from two determined raptors could produce such white knuckle effects?  Four stars, however, instead of five; with the exception of the ongoing disillusion of Park founder John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) none of the other characters are fully vetted and fleshed out--including the leading roles, played by Sam Neill and Laura Dern (wolf howl).  Yet I'm being picky; in JURASSIC PARK, why should a character be fleshed out when they already have their real flesh at risk?<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B000059XUP|4.0|This film, in my personal opinion, was beautiful. I love The Crow more than The Crow: City of Angels, but this film still was a really good watch.<br /><br />Let me preface this with: I haven't read the comics - I just love the first two movies in The Crow series (everything after, no thanks). I'm not sure how much the movies strayed from the actual comics, but that's really not my concern - so I don't care :P<br /><br />Anyway, what we watch on this DVD - what we watched in theaters - what we watch on TV - is NOT the movie in its entirety. So much was cut out of the original script - key moments, scenes, actions, lines that tie the story together. Without these, it made the final product pretty confusing and seeming like there's something missing - because there is.<br /><br />I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned this in the reviews on here yet - I didn't have time to read through them all - I recommend Googling: The Crow: City of Angels Second Coming. There's a Web site that explains everything and there's even a fan-edited version of the film tying the missing pieces into the movie. The scenes were either shot and cut or were never shot at all - so the actual theatrical scenes aren't in the fan-edit of the film, but the storyline itself is. Check it out and see if it changes your opinion of the movie :)
B000UJ48UO|5.0|If you are even just a hint of a fan of this movie, this Blu-Ray is a must, Stunning quality that will leave you satisfied!!
B003FSTN52|5.0|Great show! This is my favorite show ever! One thing I don't like... when I set up subtitle in English, but it's for deaf and disabled. I'm not a deaf. I just need to read subtitle/caption sometimes.

B002VECM6S|5.0|My family has gotten out of the habit of watching movies together every week like we used to, but my daughter saw this in the theater and strongly recommended my husband and I watch it.  We finally got to it on Saturday night and I wonder what took us so long !  The last movie I liked this much was \\"The King's Speech\\" which was fabulous.<br /><br />This is the uplifting story of a young man who makes something of himself with the help of people who take an interest in him.  I will have to agree with Amazon.com review that it could have felt emotionally manipulative and overdone, but it didn't.  The cast is unbelievable and Saundra Bullock shows throughout the film that she is a very talented actress, not just a pretty face.  A cast that was perfect for their parts, a story that will tug at your heartstrings -- what more could you ask?  Definitely one worth watching more than once.

0385334206|2.0|Let me start by saying that I already had my doubts about Vonnegut. I've already admitted that I could never get into Slaughterhouse-Five, and while I'd not given it as many tries, Cat's Cradle didn't do anything for me either.  So why, one might ask, did I pick up yet another Vonnegut?  It was more than just a burst of misguided optimism - I got a solid recommendation from a trusted source (Paul Dail) who claimed that this one was different and had influenced him a great deal.  It was, in fact, one of the ten books that had the biggest influence on him as a writer, and a number of his other choices were books that I also enjoyed a great deal.  Plus it was actually about a writer and the gestalt between writer and character.  And if that doesn't total a solid recommendation, I don't know what does...<br /><br />Well, Paul, I have good news and bad news.<br /><br />First the good. I actually finished this one. So right off the bat you achieved what no one else has ever been able to - you got me through Vonnegut. And I did really dig the whole writer-writes-himself-into-the-story thing - Vonnegut himself plays a role (and not entirely minor, either) in the story.<br /><br />Now, unfortunately, the bad. And this part will be a tish longer. And it requires me to attempt to give you a brief synopsis of the book first, to make sure anyone who hasn't read it can follow where I go.  If you have never read Vonnegut, you may be confused by that last bit - \\"attempt to give you a brief synopsis\\".  I mean, who can't give a synopsis of a story they've read, right?  Well, Vonnegut doesn't really write stories quite that straightforwardly, so the synopsis isn't as easy as all that.  I will do my best though - and anyone (like Paul) who happens to have read the book and to have something to add that either (a) I missed, or (b) makes the story seem a bit more logical, should feel free to add it to the comments!<br /><br />In short, the book is about an author (Kilgore Trout) and a reader (Dwayne Hoover).  Hoover invites Trout to town for a \\"cultural festival\\" - as Trout makes his way to town, Hoover descends into insanity, largely due to Trout's books.  Much mayhem ensues.  A slew of other characters are introduced.  Vonnegut himself appears on occasion, full of snark and piss and vinegar.  Oh yeah, and line drawings.  Yup, the book is sprinkled with Vonnegut's drawings throughout.  They are intended to illustrate the story.  Mostly they just seem to emphasize the randomness.<br /><br />I'm sure a better reader than I could come up with a better synopsis, full of in-depth analysis and literary meaning.  The book was written in the 1970s and it's entirely possible that I just am not in the spirit of the times enough to get it's all-over-the-place-ness.  Or maybe it's just not that great a book.  Who knows.  Whatever the reason, it didn't resonate with me.  Sure, I enjoyed a few parts of it; Vonnegut is clever and every now and then throws out a pearl of insight, laden with cynicism and bitter wisdom.  But on the whole, it felt disjointed and kind of pointless.  And that's the biggest disappointment of all.<br /><br />I wanted to like this one.  I really did.  I liked the way other people talked about this book, I liked the premise - the interaction between author and obsessed reader, the interposition of the author into the story, the idea of an author who thinks he writes crap when other people think he is some sort of prophet.  I wanted to like the bits of \\"art\\" scattered throughout the story, the very randomness I had a hard time following.  But I just didn't.  It felt like that kind of bizarre seventies crap that I have always found self-indulgent and overly pleased with itself - the kind that doesn't make sense and is proud that it doesn't.<br /><br />Again I offer the following: maybe I am just not the right kind of reader - for this genre or for Vonnegut.  Who knows.  Regardless, I think it's safe to say that I'm done with Vonnegut.  I managed to get through one entire book, so I am comfortable saying that now.  So if nothing else, thanks for that Paul!e saying that now.  So if nothing else, thanks for that Paul!
B005BZQS1E|5.0|This movie reminds me of an online rpg; sword and sorcery setting (provided by the developers) mixed with very creative vulgarity (provided by a lot of the players).  The attention to detail in the script and sets is extremely refreshing.  I should think people with an uninhibited sense of humor will be laughing from start to finish.  There are perhaps dozens of instant-classic lines and moments.<br />  Those who don't like the idea of over-the-top adult themes mixed with their dungeons and dragons should steer well clear, because that's what this film offers in spades.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|That's what I feel like Lucas is doing, and unfortunately no matter how much fans protest he keeps right ON doing it!<br /><br />I too was one of those who grew up with Star Wars. I remember (barely) when I was 5 seeing the first film when it came out. But I clearly remember the world embracing it afterwards, and the 3 years it lived in anticipation of the second film, my personal favorite, and the glorious agony awaiting the resolution to the cliffhanger of cliffhangers that \\"Jedi\\" brought us.<br />It was more than the films themselves for those of us who grew up then. Many of the happiest memories for me were of listening to the soundtrack from \\"Empire\\" as I lay in front of the stereo for hours just looking at the album cover, which I still have BTW, the one with Luke on his tauntaun, Han passionately leaning over Leia, (yes, I was only 8 then, but I was in love with Han and wishing I were in her place. ^_^) But my most fond memories were tied to the play sessions my older brother and I had where he would sort of puppeteer the action figures and I would interact with them. He did a hell of a Yoda voice sounded JUST like him! ^_^<br /><br />Anyway, it all became a corner stone of my childhood as I'm sure it did for many others. And it was all because of these wonderful films. So it is heartbreaking to see Lucas disregard what Star Wars means to us. Yes, they're \\"his\\" creations, but he gave them to us in a certain way, I'd say in a perfect way. Why destroy that?!? I will never understand.<br /><br />I sold my DVD versions of the 6 films when I heard they were coming to bluray, that is before I learned there were even MORE modifications being made. I was only grudgingly able to accept the first set of \\"improvements\\" and now I'm done accepting these changes he seems to think we need. So I won't be buying these discs.<br /><br />I eventually will have to re-buy the DVD's I sold, and be content that I have the first three films on laser disc. Yes the quality of them is nothing to write home about, but they're in true letterbox, and for me, it's the story and the chance to relive my youth....the way I actually lived it the first time (sans Lucas' ever altering vision) that I truly care about!hey're in true letterbox, and for me, it's the story and the chance to relive my youth....the way I actually lived it the first time (sans Lucas' ever altering vision) that I truly care about!
0553801473|1.0|Would've been an appropriate title.<br /><br />I am so disgusted with myself for the amount of time I wasted reading this book. I can't even imagine how disgusted George Martin must be with himself for the amount of time he wasted writing it.<br /><br />Jon Snow dead? Who knows, who cares any more. I'm finished with this series. Mr. Martin, do us a favor and stop writing - it's unbearable.
B004EPYZP8|3.0|watched this film the other night and was curious about it and it was real slick and polished and it had a old school matlock kinda sorta feel to it.not alot of surprises, but it was well paced and you kinda figured out a few things here and there. it tried to be old school and yet modern and it connected both worlds with a up dated twist. it was a well done film and it could have a life as a tv show.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This is what I call a \\"front to backer\\" meaning you can literally pop this in and chill.  It is all good for the duration.  Wycleff's interviews with the children, the heartfelt expressions and soulful voice truly makes this a beautiful piece of art.<br /><br />For me this album truly defines a time in my life where I finally realized who I was.  Strong yet vulnerable, Confident yet unsure, a beautiful original that was just figuring things out...a girl at the cusp of womanhood!  The emotions that these songs evoke in me to this day  are powerful indeed.  There really is no one else out there like Lauryn...I miss her!
B0055EDBIE|3.0|i dig the album cover and the spirit involved and to me this album sounds like the album that should have followed his 5th album and it took some years to make.  Lenny Kravitz is the dude who understands playing the role of a rock Star, problem is his music and his lack of originality  keep him in the settling and wearing influences all up and down his sleeves.  Lenny found his niche long ago and he knew where his musical bread was buttered.  this album has a little more snap than the past few ones, still  you know what to expect from him though. he has the familiar riffs and sound. he makes music for his circle and he doesn't ever step too far from that space and place.<br /><br />never ever going to get that all out funk album from him, but you get some riffs and moods that sometimes suggest and hint that he wants to semi groove, but you know what you are going to get. the album cover is cool and i give him dap for staying true to what he does and knowing his musical lane.
B0043GXYBO|1.0|I read this because I didn't have anything else to read and my friend said \\"Do you want to read these with me?\\" and I said yes. I thought the same as everyone else. Overly \\"teenage\\" language made me want to vomit. \\"poopie\\" and \\"boobies\\" What the heck?  And Stevie Rae? Shes not southern, is she? Damien? Is he gay? because I MIGHT have gotten that VIBE.  Does Zoey like brown pop by chance? GOOD GOD they were SO OVERDONE! Every TIME they mentioned any of the characters, they were ALL related to HES GAY, SHES SOUTHERN, SHE LIKES BROWN POP.  THATS IT? From all the characters?  HER GRANDMOTHERS INDIAN!! Just to make sure you don't forget, that's all well talk about.  Sorry to rant, my reviews are usually nice but this was such a waste.  AND I'm on the freaking dragon book now - I thought it would END at like, seven, but its apparently never going to end.
B002ZG99N6|2.0|saw this film recently and i thought the directing was on point, but somehow you sorta knew how it might end up and there wasn't alot of counter pacing to make you not think otherwise.i've seen this kind of film countless times and nobody ever gets away and you just know that despite an occasional slip or get away how it is all going to end.  it was an ok film.
0439023521|5.0|These books are INCREDIBLE! There wasn't a part I didn't like. I wish I could go back and re-read them for the first time because OH MY GOODNESS they were so so so fantastic. I forwarded the first chapter link to everyone in my department at work.  Everyone was hooked. LOVE these books. Read them read them read them!
1582701709|3.0|i happen to see somebody reading this book recently and i decided i needed to go to barnes and noble sip on some ice water and chill and read this book and i did. it was very compelling with what it was saying and how it made you think. can't say one way or the other the full basis i got out of it, however it wasn't like any other book i had been digesting and reading in recent times. pretty interesting and the way it was worded and broken down kept your interest regardless if you agreed or not with how and what was said and worded.<br />its one of those books you will either love or loath. i was in the middle.it is interesting though and i applaud the Swagger.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|This movie was purchased for our grand kids to watch,but as we watched with them we were drawn back to our childhood days and we said that we enjoyed it more so than we did as kids.This was a two disc 50th anniversary platinum.After looking at all, it brought back fawnd memories and even though the characters were dogs it is a good story line to how valuable that true feelings each of us should have for one another and true friends should help one another at all cost.Lady and Tramp did and look how it worked out in the end.Happy days and pups to train to be like them and make the world a better place.    You at Amazon continue to keep up the good service and condition of movies on arrival to us. Again thank you so much.      Bob Parris  Prattville,Al
B004LWZVZC|2.0|This is a thinly disguised classic Hollywood lefty propaganda effort against our country's efforts to protect us from terrorism, and as such, I detest Redford's arrogance in trying to sell us copies at great expense for his overpaid cast and services!    The lines are purely hypothetical, and bear no resemblance to reality.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It amazes me that something that hasn't even been released yet has been given a single star rating by over 500 people, all because of the addition of a two letter word that lasts less than five seconds. Not that I disagree with you about the silliness of the addition, I too prefer Vader to be silent when destroying the Emperor. However, that does NOT mean I'm going to cancel my order. I'm not going to allow 5 seconds to ruin 40 hours of bonus features, and all 6 films in 1080p. I'll get used to it, just like a got used to all of the other changes in previous releases.     In fact the ONLY thing that doesn't sit well with me about these changes is the fact that it is kind of disrespective to the memory of Richard Marquand.    If you guys really feel so strongly about it, than attack George's wallet not his personal feelings. Because I think he stopped listening to us a looong time ago and gone with what HE wants, over what WE want. What would you guys do after a decade of destructive criticism? You'd probably ignore everyone else too.       I know I'm probably just going to get a bunch of hate for this, and probably be called a \\"Lucas apologist\\" or something stupid like that, but there has to be someone positive in an online  fan community where there is only negative.
B004T5R2HQ|4.0|Controls may not be intuitive, but does what it says.  Scans pics and docs with ease.  I enjoy the create a pdf aspect of this app as well.  Not giving it 5 stars for not the best controls (after taking a picture one has to move each corner of the box to crop it - slightly cumbersome).
B004UMVW7E|5.0|I read this book when I was in high school.  I took it to a summer camp with me and read it during our break time after lunch every day in the heat.  It quickly became one of my favorites, and this is coming from someone who didn't do a lot of spare reading in high school.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|I love this album. I grew up during the time of its release and it will therefore always be very nostalgic for me.    BUT, and I write this in CAPITAL letters, it's not their greatest record. I still think \\"Smash\\" is, and as a record, even \\"Conspiracy of One\\" is better than \\"Americana\\". But there's no nostalgia tied to \\"Conspiracy of One\\" or \\"Smash\\" for me, which makes them not as fun to listen to for me.    Another reason this album is so special to me: \\"Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\\" was the first ever rock song I liked. I was seven years old and it was the spring of 1999. Without The Offspring, I would probably listen to jazz like my grandmother, or modern day hip-hop. But I don't, I listen to rock, punk, blues and metal, and a big reason for that is this particular album!    My favourite song from \\"Americana\\" is \\"Staring at the Sun\\". The rest of the songs are great as well, but \\"Staring...\\" will always be my favourite.      So to all you hardcore punks out there: If The Offspring hadn't sold out, \\"Americana\\" probably wouldn't have been as big as it was (but it would no doubt still be popular), I wouldn't have heard \\"Pretty Fly\\", and I would most likely listen to hip-hop. Sometimes selling out can change other people's lives. Just sayin'.
B0002S947K|5.0|Like many others, I became aware of him because \\"Trouble\\" was the sound track behind a Travelers Insurance commercial during the summer of 2011 while I was laid up in the hospital.  Bonus - the whole CD is excellant.  In time, I'll buy<br />all of his recordings.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|I thought this movie was silly and odd. But I didn't buy it for me I got it for my boyfriend and it is one of his favorites! He enjoyed it! Big Christian Bale fan.
0307454541|1.0|Well...I heard great things about this book. I really wanted to read it, but I have to say, I'm reconsidering it. I bought a kindle because it was supposed to save me money in the long run. The books were supposed to be cheaper. Why would I pay less for the paperback than for the digital copy??? This is nothing against the book, its all for amazon. And don't give me crap about paying for licenses. Amazon pays a lump sum for the rights and banks all the rest. They've already roped me in to being a committed customer with this stupid reader and now they want to overcharge me for a book who's pages I'll never touch?<br /><br />Screw that. I miss Borders.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Esta película es, para mi,la mejor de MARVEL. Contiene escenas de acción muy buenas, y los efectos especiales también son muy buenos. Recomiendo ver la versión en Blu Ray, ya que contiene mucho más que el DVD, incluyendo la versión en español. Todo fan de los cómics la debe tener.
B002FGU4DU|5.0|Used to NEVER wear shoes when I was younger and lived at the beach, even when we moved to the flatlands, and I've worn literally tons of shoes and sandals of every type and design since eventually (after moving to Washington State then to the Bay Area) having to wear shoes almost all the time, and I've never found anything which fits better for my feet and gives so much arch support as the Teva.<br /><br />This version  I like this style because of the extra padding under the strap crossing areas, which keeps my feet from being rubbed sore on the top. And I like the lack of a toe strap, like most flip-flop styles, since sand from beach walking, or dirt from outdoor activities gets under and sandpapers my skin raw.<br /><br />These things generally last me about five or more years, providing the dog doesn't chew them up, and they withstand constant use, wear, washing, salt water, soap scrubs, and sun the whole time.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I needed to transfer waypoints off of an old legacy GPS. This cable works swell just like it is suposed to. Set up was a snap on Windows 7.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Update on 9/29/2012 to my original review below:<br /><br />Finally got around to seeing it. Put off seeing it because I worried that perhaps the negative reviews were true. Was I in for a pleasant surprise! Lucas didn't let us down. It is everything I hoped for. Outstanding clarity and color. Good execution of Blu-ray on my high-res display. Spectacular sound quality on my Bose stereo system. Specifics given in the extensive and excellent five star reviews said it all, and I'm at a loss to add anything there! It's all true about this being an outstanding box set, down to the fine quality packaging with bound book containing DVDs that is easily accessible. Lucas spared no expense.<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />Original pre-release review unedited:<br /><br />AMAZON's policy of allowing reviews prior to a product's release means nobody who reviewed this Blu-ray edition of STAR WARS: The Complete Saga is basing their comments on actually buying, receiving, and viewing the product.<br /><br />If I had never seen these reviews, and suspected the rating was skewed due to people \\"reviewing\\" these DVDs prior to actually viewing them, I would want to know the following information to do my own calculation on the REAL review ratings based on actual *buyers* after the product was released! Although this will incite anger in those hoping to keep you from buying a product they have never themselves purchased and viewed, I'm going to post this anyway. So those who want to diss me, have at at! :)<br /><br />By the way, the basis of my 5-star rating is simple. Amazon allows reviews prior to a product's release. A review can be any rating one wishes. People are taking advantage of this fact. Therefore, I'm going to take the \\"all's fair in love and war\\" approach and provide statistics as of Tuesday, September 6, 2011 (which ratings skyrocketed over the Labor Day weekend), to help legitimate future buyers calculate the REAL ratings based on some baseline:<br /><br />Amazon Ratings As of September 6, 2011:<br />817 Reviews<br />5 star:  (168)<br />4 star:  (27)<br />3 star:  (28)<br />2 star:  (33)<br />1 star:  (561)<br /><br />Keep in mind, this product has not been release, yet has the above ratings. Anyone with the average number of human brain cells should be able to see how real future ratings are being obfuscated.<br /><br />I know, I know, if this gets posted like the other 817 pre-release \\"reviews\\" above, at least 561 people are going to be furious at me. No matter what you say I'm NOT a Lucas employee trying to defend the motherland, lol!
B0000046KM|5.0|The great Shirley Horn deserves the appreciative audience that this CD has brought out. It thrills me to know that so many people rated this CD with the top 5 stars. This is exactly how it should be in a universe that makes any sense.    I won't go into the music much here, only to say that I bought this CD three years ago during a particularly stressful period in my life. The music gave me so much solace in a world that seemed to teeter on the edge of madness all around me. Keeping myself centered and true to self in that crazy and shallow world of Los Angeles became easier because I had the time to be quiet and keep myself safe. This music really helped.    I've been out of that dark period for 2.5 years now and my life is decidedly better. I'm in love with life and I still listen to this album because it reminds me that beauty and excellence will always win out over the mediocrity and pettiness that is all around us.
0141192453|3.0|I've recently read War and Piece and Moby Dick and I found Treasure Island more difficult to read than the former two. Its unfathomable how children around the age of 9 can read this.    I do no know whether it was because I kept picking it up and starting and stopping again or if its the style of writing. The book sometimes seems a blur when I was reading it and and cant grasb the details. For instance I didnt realize the main charactor was a boy not a man- I just learned that from a review. There is a lot of sailing terminology which the writer expects the reader to already know, where as in Moby Dick the writer explains. I still enjoyed the story and charactors and it is still worth reading as its only a couple of a hundred pages.

0446677450|4.0|In this easy to read book the author outlines the differences in the financial decisions taken by the poor, middle class and the rich people. The rich people become richer by investing in assets. An asset is an investment which \\"puts money in your pocket\\". That means that an asset is something which generates a positive cash flow. A liability is an investment which drains money out of your pocket and creates a negative cash flow. Against the contemporary belief, the author argues that the investment in the house you live is a liability and not an investment.  Individuals should strive to build assets so that the cash flowing in your pocket is equal to your expenses - that is to be financial independent. One can pay their bills by a steady income but cannot create wealth.  The author advices young couples to not invest all their money in a big expensive house, instead, concentrate on purchasing assets which will make them financially independent. The second point author emphasizes is to start your own business (work for yourself) and create a career ladder than climb a career ladder. Small businesses and corporations have enormous tax benefits. A short history of income taxes in United States is very interesting. The corporations spend first and then pay taxes, while the individuals must pay taxes beforehand. To conclude, the book provides commonsense financial and accounting advice for making sound decisions. A person not familiar with personal finance or just starting his/her career can find the book immensely useful. The author repeats many times that \\"make money work for you\\" instead of \\"work for money\\".

B004XQO90O|1.0|For hard-core S.F. films this will be a disaster. The casting of Jake G. is really off the mark, like casting Jim Carry in Goodfellas. This is a weak entry, nowhere near the other competitor in its class, Inception, which I also disliked. I suppose I might have found it tolerable if someone else were cast in the lead role, for JG is truly an awful embarrassment of an actor. The first minute of bizarre facial expressions in the train scene prove that. This \\"acting\\" had me in stitches.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|I had been looking at different digital home theater systems to replace my old Aiwa system, which works perfectly, but was made obsolete by my Panasonic TCP46C2 plasma television.  I'm so glad I came across this little device.  I have a PS3, a MacBook, a Dish Network receiver, the Hubble Telescope, and the Very Large Array, going into the TV, but was limited to the speakers on the television.    I just plugged this bad boy in and ran a $2 Toslink cable, which I also bought on Amazon, into the converter, and ran RCA cables into the Aiwa system.  Voilá.  Each input on the TV has its own volume leveler, so there's very little futzing around with the audio settings when switching between streaming Netflix and searching for extraterrestrials.  The audio quality is excellent, considering the price.    This little device is the best invention since democracy or Silly Putty.

B003L77G10|5.0|I must admit that I came to The Good Wife late and did not start watching until the end of Season 1, but I'm so glad that I finally discovered this show. I watched Season 1 on DVD, and it just improved as it went along.  Season 2 was even better.  I consider it to be the best drama on television right now.  I watch Mad Men, Breaking Bad and other shows, but this show does everything well. The talented people behind this show put out 23 first-rate episodes a season, and that's impressive these days.     The acting and writing are wonderful, but the set design, the clothing and every other aspect of the show are also excellent.  The writers took the storylines to places I just did not see coming. Julianna Margulies as the lead is consistently outstanding, and the rest of cast is superb.  As far as I'm concerned, there is no weak link in the cast.  Kudos to the casting director.  His decision to cast Alan Cumming as Eli Gold is worthy of an Emmy alone.     This show establishes that a (network) drama can be intelligent, elegant and entertaining all at the same time.
0062060554|4.0|I would add this book to be one of my favorites. I do not understand all the negative reviews.  I thought the book held ones interest throughout the entire story.  I found myself trying to guess what the outcome would be only to be somewhat surprised at each turn of events. I can't imagine waking every day not knowing who I am. This was a unique concept and I truly enjoyed reading how she coped.
0920668364|5.0|This is my 3 year old great granddaughter's favorite book. Kaydencce Le-ann has already learned the little \\"song\\" and can more or less tell the story by herself. The illustrations are wonderful. It is a great book and I recommend it to anyone with young children.
0307279189|4.0|Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen is, at its core, a sports story. There are no underdogs, leagues, or even points. Nor will the average sports fan know any of the main players. But the book's inherent mystery is a key part of its charm. For the jaded sports fan, it is nice to find that there are still sports that exist below the radar: below the salary caps, trade deadlines, and lockouts. It is refreshing to read about a sport where people still compete for the purest of reasons: love of competition.         The author, Christopher McDougall, is a runner. And like most runners, he was constantly plagued by injuries. This book hinges around McDougall setting out to find the answer to one of the most frequent questions asked by runners: why does my foot hurt? The answer leads the reader to a race of superhumans, an underground movement of extreme athletes, the evolution of humanity and a cast of characters that only real life could produce (read: Barefoot Ted and Billy \\"Bonehead\\").      If McDougall told this story in a bar, which he would and did for many years, onlookers would immediately write it off as drunken fabrication. The storyline is so full of exotic places and cultures, larger-than-life characters, and feats of extraordinary human conditioning and will power, that at times it feels like picking up Indiana Jones' journal and reading about his new hobby: ultrarunning. But the real key to this book's success is the prose. McDougall writes about each character with such reverence that growing attached to each of these super humans is all but inevitable.       But while the prose is fluid and the awe and excitement of McDougall's writing seeps from every page, his digressions inch the pace along. The story never falls into convolution, and the digressions all tend to be interesting, but McDougall's attempt to set the stage for the grand race at the end makes what should be the crescendo of the book seem buried in too much noise. Although maybe, like ultrarunning, the goal is not the destination but the journey.      McDougall's journey to fine out why he is constantly recovering from a running injury reads like a high adventure, epic sports story, and exposé on ultrarunning all rolled into one. Imagine equal parts Krakauer's Into Thin Air, without the mountain, and Steve James' Prefontaine, without the tragedy; or just read this book. McDougall's passion and love for running rolls off of every page and envelops the reader. And in the odd chance that it doesn't, this book's journey from New England to Colorado and the western United States, ending in the Copper Mountains of Mexico, is worth the read for the sheer escapism.     This book, in spite of my deep loathing of running, made me lace up my running shoes and go sprinting out the front door. Fifteen minutes later, I limped back through my front door, feeling like I had suffered a heart attack and stroke, simultaneously. I had painfully relearned why I hate running. But over the course of his book, McDougall made me forget. And there is no higher praise that I could give.
0060775858|5.0|I purchased this book for my 3 year old great granddaughter. Kaydencce Le-ann loves it and we have read it over and over...first I read it to her and then she \\"reads\\" it back to me. The words and illustrations are great for her age group. I would recommend this book to anyone with young children.

B0014TEWNW|5.0|This episode was the best one yet. I really enjoyed the latter half of it because of the raw emotion and reality that it creates for the viewer. The conversation that Walt has with his family and that dynamic is incredible and very thought provoking. The choice that Walt eventually makes is a thrill to discover. Great show - so real.
B0036EH3UC|4.0|BATTLESTAR GALACTICA: TV SERIES (5 stars)    Tampoco voy a entrar en mucho detalle. Una serie genial, con ciertos altibajos en algunos momentos de mitad de temporada. Grandes personajes, una historia muy bien construida y un final mas que decente.    BATTLESTAR GALACTICA: DVD SERIES (3 stars)    La serie viene presentada en una caja de carton (que en mi caso vino casi totalmente rota por la parte de arriba, por lo que ya pierde una estrella), en la cual se incluyen las 4 temporadas de la serie, asi como la version extendida de  Razor, la pelicula The Plan y los webisodios The Resistance (no incluye los de TFOTE, una estrella menos otra vez). En si el pack no esta nada mal, ya que salvo lo endeble de la caja y que The Plan esta incluido de manera cutre en uno de los slims de la 4 temporada, es todo correcto. Para mi alegria no solo tiene subtitulos en español en todos los capitulos, sino tambien en el contenido extra, lo que es un puntazo.    EN RESUMEN: una de las mejores series de la decada en un pack que, sin ser perfecto, consigue cumplir su proposito. RECOMENDABLE.

B005CAATXG|5.0|Icon for Hire's hard work and gestating talent emerge in the form of their debut albulm, Scripted, thus solidifying their ground in the vastly expanding rock genre fronted by female vocalists.  While it's easy to compare their work to bands such as Paramore, Versaemerge, Flyleaf, or Tooth & Nail's other femme-featuring group, The Letter Black, IFH's members take the music and stamp a unique signature of excellent drum-work (from the extremely talented Adam Kronshagen) layer Josh and Shawn's rythmic bass/guitar sounds, and then cover it with Ariel's versatile and lovely vocals to create a remarkably solid album.  I can't honestly say there's a song on here that I dislike-each one brings its own charm and message forth, and a lack of dead air between tracks has them rolling one into the next like a heavy-rock sermon. While some people are lamenting over the tracks from their self-titled EP that have been re-recorded (The Grey, Off with Her Head, and Only a Memory), I believe the new versions offer a more matured and professional sound then their previous counterparts, while allowing the EP its own charm and re-playable value. Let's face it, if every track from the EP were put on the album, there would hardly be any new material, and almost no reason to purchase it -a sad thing given the band's talent.  My one fault with Scripted lies in it's opening track, Overture, which is a musical lead in to the second track, Theatre. It's a great piece, but I find intro tracks to be a disturbing fad that I've seen in a growing number of Japanese releases too (I'm looking at you Kuroki Meisa), in which I can't help but think of the unfortunate full-length track that could've been placed in it's stead. However, in total I don't think this devalues Scripted by any means, since the rest of the CD is strong enough.   For those who are fans of strong-sounding rock bands, or looking for something akin to their female-fronted favourites, you can't do any wrong by purchasing this album. If you can be fortunate to see the band perform live, that's even better, as they are disarmingly friendly,put on an excellent and highly energised show, and can definately break more barriers with increasing fan support! ^_^
B001LF347E|5.0|This show is refreshingly exciting and adorable without being so \\"family-friendly\\" that it makes you nauseaus.  The actors are excellent (barring the woman who plays Morgana who is one of those unfortunate actors who think you look really sincere if you move your eyebrows a lot), and the stories are fun and reference the arthurian legends just enough to give me geeky thrills whenever I recognize a character name or a particular quest, but not so much that I already know exactly what's going to happen. (Btw Buffy fans will recognize the actor who played their beloved Giles in the character of Uther Pendragon)  The show is totally anachronistic and the humor can be juvenile at times, but it's light-hearted and fun, so what more can you ask for from a modern fantasy?  The bro-mance between Arthur and Merlin is hilarious, and the show only improves as it gets older, so check out this season and then keep moving forward (the newest season is starting soon, so you better catch up).
0393338398|5.0|This was a fun read. I'm sorry I never got around to it earlier, but better-late-than-never.  I'll be interested to see how the movie plays out.    Author Michael Lewis tackles a somewhat-mundane subject and makes it fascinating.  A big part of the reason the book is so readable is that its central character, Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane, is a very interesting guy.  There isn't a dull chapter in this book and a lot of that is due to Lewis's account of the volatile Beane.    As a fan of the game and why certain players are more valuable than others - outside the obvious - this was a great baseball book, in general, as well as a character study of Beane and several ballplayers.
0345529057|5.0|After reading the other reviews, I am so glad I chose to do this series as audio books! The story is amazing! I find myself feeling the cold of the wall! I am getting ready to start book 4 and I can't wait!

B002XTBE6K|5.0|Having NEVER read the book, I absolutely enjoyed this movie.    Reading other reviews, BBC's Emma was criticized for not following true to Austen's book or dialogue. I completely agree the dialogue was altered. Although I have not read Emma I have read other Jane Austen novels, and I could tell this movie did not stand true to Austen's style.    However, if you can surpass the \\"simplified\\" language and you have NOT read the book, this is a wonderful movie. It still expresses Austen's wonderful ability to create likeable characters and wonderful love stories.    If you have read the book and want a movie that represents an EXACT interpretation of the novel then I have to warn you this may not be the best version. I would look at the 1997 movie starring Kate Beckinsale as an alternative.
0446691437|5.0|A client of mine recommended this book to me as she was writing her book. I'm always up for a great book on writing, creating, and what stops up from reaching that potential, and actually going after what we want or what we are being called to do. What I loved about this book was the simplicity of the concepts and ideas. I also loved the style in how it was presented, in short little blurbs and not long, in-depth chapters. There were so many nuggets of wisdom, that I can't wait to go back and extract them in more depth. I did a lot of underlining, but mostly I read parts and said \\"Humph.... that's interesting.\\" It caused me to really think about my resistance in a different way. When any book gets me to think, I love it. It's a great pocket guide, or book to skim through when you feel you are up against resistance. I definitely recommend it to my book writing clients!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I have a little dog and I love dogs. This true story is beautifully told and acted and the magnificent dog who played Hachi was exquisitely trained.

1400069181|5.0|I have only read the first few pages of the book and balled out in tears. I couldn't believe that some one has been through the very steps I am going through in trying to strengthen and build an organization that runs on strong entrepreneurial principles, creativity and giving. I personally have never believed that non-pofits solely are the way to go because young people are more excited about the concept of turning one dollar into another and helping those around you as you go along. Coming from a \\"developing country\\", I have always felt that I have to justify - that we are not just interested in receiving alms but in the opportunities to that allow our creativity to grow and blossom and that are financially rewarding as well.  Reading your material reinforces that against all odds its is possible. Through your powerful story I am encouraged to shake up all my obstacles and keep going on. I am ever more sure about my steps and global success to emerge!  Well done Blake. As an African woman, I look forward to replicating the impact of your Organization globally, inspiring those that come after me and off course distributing a couple of your shoes to my lovely children in Kenya.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I agree with everyone else...that is, it is sad that Lucas felt it necessary to alter the originals so extensively.  I hope that, some day, hey will release the original theatrical versions on Blu-ray.  Meanwhile, like so many, I cancelled my pre-order almost immediately.  Sad, sad, sad.
B004EPZ070|5.0|I absolutely Loved this movie!! I read the book first, which I often like to do before I watch a movie. Most of the time I am disappointed by the movie in comparison to the book, but this time I was pleasantly surprised. The actors (especially John Krasinski), made the movie what it is. It was funny, and endearing, just a really good movie.
0525950079|5.0|I love the historical setting in 1327 two centuries following the construction of the cathedral in \\"Pillars of the Earth\\". Merthin is a descendent of Jack the Builder. He is very smart. He is tenacious and never gives up. It is his dream to finish the spire. Caris and Merthin were friends from childhood through to adulthood and the story revolves around their relationship. Every character lives a different life. Relationships are complex and influenced by past dramas leading to future challenges. There are happy memories and secret sorrows, crowds of friends, enemies, and loved ones. Caris and Merthin were always in a power struggle. Ego was important to Caris. She always wanted more, to do her own thing, rather than simply be a mother and wife. She hungered for power with the nuns and sisters. Corruption of the church is exposed. Royalty and clergy double cross each other. There is much to learn about history and changes brought about by war and black death. Sexual relations keep the readers interest. A great story.<br /><br />Judith Land, Author<br />Adoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child
0061784788|5.0|I read all of James Rollins' Sigma Force series. This is my most favorite book. It has all the excitement, the suspense, the anticipation. I feel like I am being pulled into the story. He gave such vivid descriptions that I feel as if I know the characters very well and also instead of reading a book, I was watching a movie playing inside my head. I can't wait to read his next book in this series.

1602836582|1.0|This has to be one of the most overrated books of all tme. This book is the ultimate definition of \\"Blah\\", absolutely boring beyond belief. You will receive more joy from watching paint dry. I wanted to give it a zero stars rating, however, the system would not allow it.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|If you haven't read this book yet, you really must do so! I never read any Jane Austen in school etc, and just out of nowhere picked up \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" recently. It instantly became my new favorite book. The characters are captivating, the story is enthralling, and it'll leave you wanted to go back and read it again. I warned my husband, though, that I'm not in love with another man.. and his name is Mr. Darcy :)
0670020478|5.0|\\"The Element\\" is written to encourage people to go beyond anything in their life that may be holding them back.  This book has many examples of people who did not meet someone else's expectations but went on to succeed in life.  The book includes examples from business, personal lifes, school background, musicians etc.  If one is willing to learn about continuing past a failure this is an encouraging book to read.  The concepts in the book may take one well beyond their own expectations of failure and lead them to success.

1452101248|5.0|Made the potato tart, the pear crostini, the tomato and couscous salad, and the stuffed onion \\"shells\\" for a dinner party, and it did not disappoint. Full of awesome flavor combinations (caramel in the potato tart? Genius!), and lots and lots of beautiful uses of herbs. Some ingredients may be hard to find if you don't have any fancy grocery stores around, but a lot of it is based on staples that have been kicked up a notch or three -- I made all of the above with ingredients from Kroger (except the pickled Chervil leaves for the garnish on the crostini, but the dish didn't suffer for it). This isn't just for vegetarians -- or just for foodies -- if you are interested in adventurous cooking, go for it. I'm hoping to try the eggplant with pomegranate featured on the cover next -- how awesome does that sound? Some of the dishes take time to do properly, but I found the recipes fairly easy to follow.

B005869U6G|5.0|Yes, it's a little different from their usual fare, but it's still Brandon Boyd's voice, so how can you really go wrong? The melodies are pretty and lyrically the songs are beautiful. It's pretty lowkey (makes me think that they're trying to run with the current trends created by Band of Horses, Fleet Foxes, etc) but there a few songs on there that rock, like \\"Switchblade.\\" \\"If Not Now, When?\\" is a perfect rainy day song and I really like \\"Theives.\\"

0307463745|5.0|\\"Onde você trabalha quando precisa fazer alguma tarefa bem feita?\\"      As respostas para essa questão normalmente orbitam 3 tipos:  1. Um cômodo específico de um lugar - na sala, na copa, no porão, no parque...  2. Um meio de transporte - no avião, no trem...  3. Um intervalo de tempo - estranhamente algumas pessoas \\"fogem\\" do foco \\"lugar\\" para \\"tempo\\" e respondem: de manhã, no final-de-semana, de noite...    Incrível como quase ninguém responde: no Escritório (ou qualquer que seja o local de trabalho). Mas por que?   Porque as pessoas sabem que o Escritório (ou lugar de trabalho) não é um lugar produtivo, não é um lugar onde se consegue trabalhar continuamente e focado. O local de trabalho é o local onde vamos para... sermos interrompidos! E constantemente!    Pois bem. Essa é apenas uma as inúmeras idéias dos sócios da empresa de software 37signals, Jason Fried e David Heinemeier Hansson em \\"Rework\\" apontado como um dos melhores livros de negócios de 2010, avalizado em seu prefácio por nomes como Chris Anderson, Tom Peters, Seth Godin e Tony Hsieh para citar apenas alguns.  Não tive paciência para esperar a edição brasileira e me deu preguiça de lê-lo em inglês, portanto minha resenha se baseia na edição Portuguesa do outro lado do Atlântico, na tradução de Pedro Ribeiro. Muito legal.    Que o mundo está mudando não é novidade para ninguém. Que o consumidor está mudando, participando e cocriando cada vez mais, também não é novidade. Que o marketing também passa por mudanças também está ficando patente.      Mas existe uma outra mudança no mundo dos negócios que tem passado por nós muito silenciosa: a Administração em si. A forma como administramos as empresas do século XXI ainda segue \\"fórmulas\\" e técnicas do séc. XX, em sua maioria formuladas por pessoas nascidas no séc. XIX! Portanto a próxima \\"Revolução\\" social que viveremos será a revolução na Administração e na nossa relação com o Trabalho.A Administração do séc.XXI vem sido estudada e teorizada por alguns pesquisadores de renome, como Gary Hamel e Vijay Govindarajan. Alguns casos de novas práticas de Administração e Organização estão aparecendo não apenas em empresas \\"da moda\\" como Google, mas também empresas menos \\"hype\\" como a norte-americana W. Gore e a indiana HCL Technologies. Essa última inclusive rendeu um livro-relato de seu CEO - Vineet Nayar (\\"Primeiro os Colaboradores depois os Clientes\\" - já no pipeline de leitura e resenha, calma...).      Bem. Nessa linha está também \\"Rework\\" que expõe novas formas de gerir empresas, principalmente as pequenas e start-ups. O livro desenvolve toda uma nova cultura empresarial, uma nova forma de encarar o tema trabalho e gestão.      Veja algumas idéias do livro:  . Não é assim tão importante aprender com os erros: o fracasso como rito de iniciação é algo ruim em nossa cultura. Fracasso não é pré-requisito do sucesso. Fracasso é apenas fracasso. Melhor aprender com o sucesso, nem que seja dos outros.  . Planejamento é mera especulação: principalmente a longo prazo. É assustador trabalhar sem um plano. Mas pior é seguir cegamente um plano irreal.  . Porque crescer?: existem muitos negócios rentáveis e pequenos. Quanto maior a empresa maior a possibilidade de não conseguir se diferenciar. Ainda mais nesses tempos de \\"Cauda Longa\\".  . Workaholics são estúpidos (e preguiçosos): herói é quem chega em casa cedo, pois descobriu formas mais eficientes e rápidas de se fazer as coisas.  . Comece pelos seus próprios problemas: quer lançar algum produto ou serviço? Comece desenvolvendo algo que seja solução para algum problema seu. Certamente vai saber vendê-lo muito melhor.  . Falta de tempo não pé desculpa: se é importante faça logo e deixe o que não é importante para depois.  . Você precisa de menos do que julga: frugalidade nos negócios nunca faz mal.  . Abra uma Empresa, não uma start-up: foco nos resultados, não no financiamento externo.  . A afinação está nos seus dedos: como dizem os bons guitarristas. Não se importe tanto com o equipamento de inicio, a sua capacidade de resolver conta mais nessa fase. Depois você consegue comprar equipamentos melhores.  . A interrupção é inimiga da produtividade: deixe seus colaboradores trabalharem onde produzam mais e melhor. Produção e principalmente criação é como o Sono: tem fases. Uma vez interrompido, para se retomar de onde se parou é necessário \\"voltar\\" algumas fases e refazê-las. Gerentes e Reuniões são os inimigos número 1 da produtividade. Não interrompa os seus colaboradores a não ser que seja essencial e urgente. Não marque tantas reuniões e com tanta gente. Reunião não é trabalho, é pausa para pensar no que trabalhar, portanto \\"menos é mais\\".  . Faça \\"to-do lists\\" pequenos: listas grandes desencorajam a terminá-las. Foque nos \\"quick wins\\", vitórias rápidas que encorajam todos a proceguir.  . Aprenda a dizer \\"não\\" aos clientes: seu produto não precisa ser o melhor do mercado. Precisa ser um bom produto a um preço justo e flexível o suficiente para poder ser adaptado. Querer encher seu produto de recursos só vai transformá-lo em um banco-de-dados de recursos. Foque no que se propõe e entregue o proposto.   . Em reuniões com clientes, não tome nota: apenas preste muita atenção. O que realmente for importante vai lhe ser repetido tantas vezes que você vai sair da reunião com aquilo decorado. Tudo o que for anotar vai esquecer, além de não ser tão importante.  . Marketing não é um Departamento: é uma atividade como qualquer outra, só que TODOS os colaboradores são responsáveis por ela.  . Primeiro faça você mesmo: antes de contratar para uma nova posição ou terceirizar uma atividade, tente fazer você mesmo por um curto tempo. Além de aprender as nuances da atividade para depois melhor interagir com quem venha a contratar, pode ser que você descubra que não precisa de ninguém para fazer aquilo, ou mesmo que não precisa absolutamente daquela atividade. Ótima!  . Faça Test-drives com colaboradores: antes de contratar efetivamente, contrate por um projeto e prazo específicos. É no dia-a-dia do projeto você vai descobrir como é a pessoa, não na entrevista ou no currículo (normalmente fantasioso).      Enfim, \\"Rework\\" tem muito a dizer como possivelmente será a Administração e a Cultura Organizacional das empresas desse nosso século que está apenas começando.  Sem dúvida faz refletir muito. Faz também querer se preparar para esse porvir.      Excelente leitura. Altamente recomendado, principalmente para os profissionais em inicio de carreira (que terão longa jornada nesse novo contexto) ou para novos empreendedores que cedo ou tarde vão se encontrar nesse novo contexto.    :)  </>.
B001GMQE7E|5.0|The track \\"Dna\\" is one of the single greatest pieces of music I have ever heard. The climax is inexplicably moving, and makes me stop whatever I'm doing for the rest of the song (I listen to this album at work). That one man could compose such a sweeping and elegant piece is beyond my comprehension. Highly recommended.

It doesn't have to be plausible in the least. It's an escape (\\"Escape From NY\\" anyone??). It's fun! Actually, after seeing the rest of his reviews, I think he's of an \\"older\\" crowd, who this movie will also be lost on. I'm glad he thoroughly enjoyed his purchase of \\"Songs of WWII Jewish Resistance\\" though.  About the movie... I thought I was going to hate it... previews of the original Rambo and seeing Sly's name all over the movie credits, I was skeptical. What a pleasant surprise! Stallone can still pull off the hero part, he looks fantastic for his age, or any age for that matter. Dragging out Dolph Lundgren was great, cameos by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis were cool, and Mickey Rourke is just a train wreck, but hey, so what? The crew of mercenaries were great. They all added something to the character interaction, making them likable and at times, amusing. This is one of those \\"blow everything up, kill all the bad guys, save the day\\" kind of 80s movies we all miss. That is, all of us old enough to remember them.  Rent it, you won't be sorry!!
B004P4S4NM|5.0|With today's studio capabilities you can make almost anyone sound like anything. With genuine talent like Adele, however, there's nothing to do but let her express herself, and you know it is going to be magical. That is what you get with her album 21. From beginning to end you are sucked in by her mesmerizing voice and the skillfulness of her lyrics. Adele's talent as a songwriter and a performer merge to create a musical masterpiece that will be able to transcend time and mark it as one of the most genuine albums of 2011.<br /><br />Simply amazing what she is able to do with her voice, and we are all the recipients of her gift.
0545259088|5.0|The story has relatively slow parts especially during the first half of the book and sometimes I wanted to skip them. But Maggie's writing pulls me back whenever I felt like drifting away. She never fail to capture my heart through her writing style and that's one reason why I enjoyed Shiver and Linger so much. Just like the first two books, Forever has the same elements that made me love the series--the lyrical writing, the beautiful plot, the amazing characters, and the emotional connections that pulls me into the story over and over again.<br /><br />It's nice to hear different POV--from Sam, Grace, Cole and Isabel. It's good that I get to hear their thoughts and that made me understand the characters better. I always liked Sam, but in Forever, I got to see more of Cole... his character developed from an immature and irresponsible to a lovable and endearing sort of guy. I love how he care about Sam, Grace and Isabel. And I love his wit and humor that makes the story more enjoyable.<br /><br />Though half of the book was a bit slow, there are certain moments that I was teary-eyed. From time to time, I've taken down notes on my favorite lines until I realized that I was writing too much! I have too many favorite lines in the story that I needed to write them down! All throughout the book, I had mixed emotions but I don't remember being happy. Don't get me wrong, the story is beautiful, it's just emotional and heartbreaking most of the time. The last part however is  exciting, it immediately put me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />The hunt is on. Grace is a wolf. Sam is still human. And Cole desperately search for the cure. During the time of the hunt, as the wolves run for their lives, I felt like I was running with them. It was so intense and definitely the most gripping part of the story... it was hard to put down.<br /><br />Forever may not be the best among the three books in the series, but it is definitely one amazing book. And even if I'm not fully satisfied with the ending, I know that somehow the author made it a hopeful and promising one. I just can't help wonder what happens to the characters after that... there are questions remained unresolved. It felt like something is lacking, and the story needs a better ending. But don't let this thing stop you in picking up this book. It's heartbreaking and it's beautiful. Don't miss the Wolves of Mercy Falls one last time.t somehow the author made it a hopeful and promising one.

0439796636|5.0|Seeing trailers for the upcoming Spielberg movie piqued my interest- especially since the horse shown strongly resembles my own! The book is written from the horse's perspective, and at a young/teen readers level that makes it a very easy and quick read. It is enjoyable for adults as well, and my copy is currently making it way around with my horse owner friends.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|It is very impressive how the writers, producer and specially the director, made an immediately master piece, just like The Dark Knight, because it has a great argument and smart story that reach the perfection. This film is so fun to watch over and over again, not only for the visual effects that in the beginning looks very impressive, but mean while the story develop, you can feel  how Caesar begin to be the powerful ape that's going to rule the Planet and make it for his kind.     I am a big fan of the Science Fiction movies, and I am very glad that this genre is still growing up and in the best way thanks to movies like this. If you not see it yet, you must reach to the movie theater near you or had to wait the Bluray because you're going to love it and want it to see it over and over again.

0743289692|5.0|I am impressed with this writer. She captures her struggle with growing up a Muslim in her native country of Somalia and other countries with such realism. I actually felt her pain and misery along with her agnst being a women in these troubled times of Islam. She writes an eye opener here into the differences in Islam and Christianity with a strong mix of politics stirred in for us all to read and try to understand. I recommend this book for reading if one wants to try and understand why. It is boldly written for us all as a help to do just that. What a blessing she is to humanity.
0553382152|2.0|This is the first somewhat negative review I have ever made on a book. The reason being is I am considerably well read on the subjects of NDE (near death experience) novels, past life regression, astrology, paranormal sorts of books, and you name it. I have a whole bookcase of them and I've read and loved every one.<br /><br />My main concern with this book is that the author relates information gathered from her near death experience with a hint of Catholicism. The author was raised strictly catholic and often enough says things like salvation is granted ONLY through Jesus Christ. Eventually you would have to accept HIM. I would accept that if she meant salvation can only be granted through the message and or meaning of Jesus Christ. And not that you have to accept this particular faith or be empty handed. Ridiculous.<br /><br />The author also says things very unlike what many say about reincarnation, she says it is not real that is pretty much a deceit based on cell memory (memories your ancestors passed down). If that were the case then lets take many of the type of scenarios like for instance an Irish man has memories of a Japanese lifetime framed within the last 200 years. How is it that they are physically related when the genealogy is accounted for at least that time length and none lead back to that type of blood ancestry? Even if cell memory were something of truth it wouldn't explain that.<br /><br />Another catholic overtone went on the subject of abortion, as we all know Catholics are usually strongly against abortion and birth control. The author says that a soul bound to aborted human fetus feel terribly \\"REJECTED\\" lol if I could feel rejection then I must be in wrong place, not paradise. She makes it clear that the spirits do not make it to earth because of just this. My many other more trusted authors such as Dr. Brian Weiss (MD and hypnotherapist) for example says, \\"An abortion, or a miscarriage, usually involves an agreement between the mother and the soul that would enter the baby. Either the baby's body would not be healthy enough to carry out its planned tasks in the coming life, or the timing is not right for its purposes, or the outside situation had changed.\\" he continues \\"I have had cases where the same soul, after a miscarriage or abortion, comes back in their next baby.\\" and so on.. The only reason I quote him as a more credible source is because he hypnotizes hundreds and hundreds of people (compared to this one authors suggestion) with unyielding accuracy with who all came back with the same information on the subjects he continuously approaches. Other authors also support this in their study with other NDE and messages they interpret. But never in no way is a person prevented from ever being born. What kind of flawless system is that?<br /><br />Anyway that's how I feel about this book. If you're reading this book out of curiosity of the sites and senses of the other side this is brilliantly descriptive. Despite the things I didn't like about this book she is the most extraordinary writer to capture the natural beauty of our spiritual home. [[ASIN:0553382152 Embraced by the Light]].nter the baby.

B0034G4P8A|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Quite a bit.  What got me, though, was the ending credits.  Being a lifelong fan of scifi (trek, wars, b-films, adventure/suspense standalone films, etc) I'd long lamented how poor the average movie-maker's understanding of astrophysics has turned out to be.  The most recent trek movie, for example, took every opportunity to fail at science they could (except with the quiet of space, I guess.)  THOR, however... Thor nailed the proper structural visualizations for nebulae like no one ever has in my movie-fanatic experience.  Perhaps it's a strange thing to notice, but I appreciated it nonetheless.

1594202842|5.0|I really enjoyed Ms. Chua's book. Although I am part Asian, I was raised by Canadian parents (My grandfather was Chinese) who never paid much attention to my education. I was always amazed at how my Asian friends and classmates managed to get straight As, even in subjects they didn't like! When I was doing my undergraduate degree at a Francophone university, I had a classmate from China who was in my program. French was her third language, and she often struggled with conversations yet she always had the highest marks in the class. I asked her how she did it. She said she had no choice. She had to get As. Her parents would not settle for less. I was impressed. That lead me to Ms. Chua's book. Although I found her to be rather strict at times, it warmed my heart how she insisted on her children's success and she would not take any excuses from them. I wish my parents had invested that kind of time to me. I have a lot of friends whose parents were happy if their kids got Cs! Ms. Chua demanded the best for her girls, and look at how well they turned out! They weren't allowed to even attend sleepovers! I agree with that. Too many kids today get to do whatever they want. I had friends in high school whose parents let their boyfriends sleepover! What kind of nonsense is that? This book is a must-read! I especially love the dog, he's so cute!

B0052VUNHC|5.0|This novel was amazing, amazing and real. The love between Travis and Abby was all encompassing, disaterously so, and yet the reader can't help but hope that they are able to make it work. Jamie McGuire writes with a passion and relevance that everyone can enjoy but those in college will especially appreciate. I applaud McGuire for portraying a love that is all consuming but one that still makes time for family, friends, and other experiences. Abby loved Travis with all her heart but she still made time for her friends (Shep, America, Brazil, Finch...ect.) and that is an example for those who are young and in love and think they have to drop everything to devote all of their life and existence to one person. Is everything in the novel healthy? No, but again it was real. Once you have finished reading this novel you will feel as if you have lived Abby's life and you will love Travis despite all of his faults, maybe because of some of them.    I recommend this novel to anyone and everyone who is old enough to understand that love is a risk and nothing is ever assured.

0756404738|3.0|During day two, the author is maddening.  Again.<br /><br />The writing is compelling, and pulls you along, just as in the first book in the series about Kvothe.  Yet the life shown is hum-dedarn-dum, as Kvothe engages in hijinks (he breaks into an opponent's room and smashes things up) and studies really hard (he reads a lot of books).<br /><br />What makes this insufferable is the bookend story, where Kvothe and his buddy constantly refer to his legendary powers and people in a small town tell \\"Kvothe\\" stories.  At one point, 200 pages in, Kvothe says \\"I may have spent too much time talking about my school days\\".  Well yes!<br /><br />The painstaking details of setting and story make for an interesting read.  The lack of a plot that progresses and real events make for a dull read.  This tension has persisted for two full and long books now.  Is the author trying to wear the readers out?  Is this a loyalty test?  Can you tell us the story now?<br /><br />At one point, Kvothe decides not to tell the story of his purportedly famous trial.  Of course!  This would require dramatic construction!  Much better to spend 11 pages talking about how Kvothe needs new shirts.  This book follows the Robert Jordan formula, endless pages about nothing, then a quick 100 page dramatic thrust, to keep the reader coming back.<br /><br />When the drama begins, the feeling is that Kvothe is \\"levelling up\\" -- almost like in a video game.  He levels up, and becomes a great fighter, and a great lover, and a pretty good magic user.  This takes a few weeks, subjective, and results in a changed Kvothe.  Maybe this is generational, but the entire realm of fantasy writing these days involves this levelling up phenomenon, where people do not learn and struggle and change as protagonists, they level up and get skills.  Makes for artificial characters.<br /><br />Why three stars?  The guy can write.  But dang it, readers spend real money for these books, and the feeling that we are being toyed with is growing.  IF you start these books in hard cover, you will switch to paper, then to the Library.  So, start with the library book.. I wish I had.h is growing.

0385534639|4.0|Supernatural romance thrillers are the rage right now, and The Night Circus fits in well with this craze.  If you enjoy a romance with supernatural elements that is written well, with a few thrills to boot; this book is for you.      The story centers on Le Cirque des Reves, a circus that only performs at night.  Wondrous things happen in this circus-one can lose oneself in the maze of clouds, or stare quietly at a garden of ice.  No performance by a magician or contortioner is the same twice at the night circus.      Two young magicians are to be the principal players in this story.  Celia and Marco have been educated since they were young to be competitor magicians in the night circus.  However, beyond the understanding of their trainers, they develop a friendly relationship and fall in love.  Then  exotic, terrible consequences follow for the main characters and for the circus.    The prose is dreamy and expressive.  This book was very easy to read and I finished it quickly.  Most of the chapters are short and to the point, there is not a lot of needless description which I also like in a book. I can't recommend it highly enough.    It is also going to be published in at least 22 other countries, and the movie rights have also been bought.  I can't wait to see the movie!

1423389387|3.0|This is a review of the unabridged, compact disc version of \\"The Wise Man's Fear.\\"      I truly enjoyed The Name of the Wind, and have anxiously anticipated this sequel coming out by Patrick Rothfuss.  The story continues the narrative of Kvothe, and concentrates soley on the year he turns 16.  Kvothe is a rambunctious, rebellious 16 year old with a lot of magical talent-a \\"Harry Potter\\" for the adult fantasy world. This book /CD concentrates on his career at the University, and his eventual departure from school.  He is a rich character, who has many different adventures.  The prose is wonderful and Kvothe easily still carries the series.     The reading of the book by Nick Pedehl is excellent.  He is colorful and lively, and uses different voices to capture each character, and narrates the tale well.  My only concern about this CD is that it is very, very long. That is why I have to give this product 3 stars.  There are 36 CDs for the unabridged version of the book, 43 hours and 18 minutes playing time.  Now it is a long book-1000+ pages, however this CD set is too long for your average car business trip.  My family and I listened to it going to several different places this summer.  We still did not finish it.  Finally, one day the kids were in school, I was able to listen to the last 8 hours.  Unless you are planning to go cross country anytime soon it is simply not feasable to listen to this.  I would recommend the abridged edition (if one exists).

This particular version, sadly, happens to be overmixed and compressed to the point where it's difficult for me to listen to, with distorted sound even at medium volume levels. Not that this is the band's or Amazon's fault, but that of the big labels and their single-minded determination to release the worst product they can possibly get away with. Another victim of the pointless loudness wars. Sad.
1400069181|4.0|I was very impressed by the ambition and good will of the author who founded the shoe company TOMS which donates a pair of shoes to people around the world every time you buy a pair yourself.<br /><br />For such a young person, he really has excellent vision.  He speaks very passionately about creating a company that not only makes a profit but also benefits the world.  And his laid-back yet visionary style of running a business is stunning in a world full of greedy CEO's and high-salary executives.<br /><br />If anyone were contemplating starting a business for profit or non-profit, I think this book has sage advice and inspiration.  It's fantastic that the author shares his success for others to follow.<br /><br />I'm not sure I can do it myself, but if by some chance I do, I'll upgrade my rating to 5-star immediately.

B002Q1YDLI|4.0|While this book is advertised as a sequel for \\"Something Borrowed\\", it picks up where that book left off, but tells a completely different story from Darcy's perspective, about her new life. If you haven't read the first book, there are several parts that wouldn't be fully understood, but for the most part this book could be read on its own.    Since the first book was from Rachel's perspective, it showed the bad sides of Darcy, but I still found myself drawn to her then. This book only furthers that opinion. It takes a flawed character and brings out her most endearing qualities, and shows her struggle to accept herself.    This book is entertaining and even evoked a few tears, even when I knew exactly what was coming next. This is a quick read, but still written well enough to let you get emotionally invested in the characters.

1241681244|5.0|This was such a good book that I couldn't possibly sing all of its praises. This gives the reader such a taste of NYC society that the charachters seemed they could have been ripped from the headlines. The title sums up the book, the vanity and pride of an assorted cast of characters blowing up in their face- unfaithful Wall St. hot shot, the gold digging girlfriend, the marxist reverened rabble rousing, race bating hustler (based on Rev. Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson), the DA with an election to win, the assistant DA desparate for glory, etc.<br /><br />I don't want to say more but they all tie into each other and in such a colorful way that I didn't want to put it down. Really one of the best works of fiction I've read in awhile.<br /><br />The story line might remind some of the Duke Lacrosse media disaster...

0307454541|1.0|Reader Beware: the book you are about to purchase produces strong reactions.<br />This is a sick and twisted book written by a sick and twisted author.  The teaser for his next novel, at the end of the story, lets you know you are in for more of the same sexual sadism and torture if you liked it in the first novel.(or liked to think that you didn't like it, but of course you loved reading about it)<br /><br />You may try and try again to get into the plot.  I simply found it passe.  Spice it up with a weird investigator.  She is interesting enough to keep you turning pages, at first.  The reward for your perseverance, and wanting to know why all of the people you know read the book, is that you are exposed to rape, sadism and torture.  You end up asking yourself why.  Has Larsson just discovered the shadow side of the human psyche?  All of it has been done before and written before, and you have paid your money and have just become another victim.  It is a waste of your time to read this, and I have no idea how it could have become so wildly popular, except that, even in movie form, it's just what humans want to do; experience second hand violence.<br /><br />It saddens me some people perceive this book as laudable.

Some characters get great attention and others much less, but the majority of the book it seems is about Hookers and a religious man who spends his life taking a beating by choice.     To put it lightly this book is a mild torture. It is melancholic throughout its entirety and really makes a point of all the bad that exists in the world.  I don't know what the author intended by his exemplification of the widespread misery and uncertainty in these people's lives.  The short bits of good news and the minimal devotion to the few happy characters weren't enough.     Yes the world is a place where bad things happen and yes no one is completely exempt.  Understood. The books was filled with people plagued with personal problems on a fundamental level and really that is no cause worth celebrating with description    pass
B0001ARCFA|2.0|I bought myself a pair of these and loved them. I wound up buying my wife and sone a set as well. I now find myself wishing that I hadn't bought these for anyone else as they are now VERY uncomfortable to wear. The ear pads on my headphones are all cracked now and are extremely uncomfortable to wear. I do wear my headphones often and for long hours but AKG should have designed ear pads which don't crack because people are wearing them a lot. To buy replacement ear pads (I need two) I'll need to buy them from some unknownn sources (as Amazon doesn't sell them) and pay roughly $22.00 to buy two replacement pads (that's almost 1/4 of what the purchase price for a new set of headphones is).<br /><br />I advise that you NOT buy these and look for other choices as I am sure your ear pads will wind up cracking after a year or two of use like mine did.<br /><br />I would have initially rated them 5-stars for sound and comfort but now I rate them 2-stars because of extreme discomfort while wearing them and I can't enjoy the sound now.
B005DC68NI|4.0|David Gaughran is a 33-year old Irish writer, living in Sweden, who spends most of his time traveling the world, collecting stories, and writing about them. In Let's Get Digital - How to self-publish and why you should Gaughran shares recent and comprehensive insights on self-publishing to (aspiring) authors. In Part One Digital Revolution the challenges facing both publishers, authors and literary agents cause a burning platform. Print is doomed, traditional brick-and-mortar book shops will follow the path of travel agents. The \\"800lb gorilla\\" Amazon dominates markets of both print and electronic books. Especially in the US e-book dominance has grown rapidly. Is there still a future for writers? Yes, by self-publishing, cutting the middle men, and practice long tail paradigm, made famous by Chris Anderson.<br /><br />In Part 2 Digital Self-Publishing the author leads you through the 10 steps of publishing, from writing a story, getting it edited, finding a proper cover, uploading and pricing at e-book sellers and getting reviews. Marketing tips (engage with your audience, use social media, blogs and social networks, but also discounts, giveaways and blog tours), calm down & carry on recommendations for those authors that discover sudden sales drops: the how to is explained in a very practical way.<br /><br />In Part 3 Gaughran gives room to 33 indie authors that share their success stories in their own words. All of them just recently joined the bandwagon of self-publishing e-books.....and make money out of it. Among others J Carson Black, Bob Mayer', Victorine Lieske, Mark Edwards, and Steven Hawk. Appendices on short(er) stories & novellas, the international (non-US) market, practicalities and resources are extras given. Of course you have to learn writing, but everything to get your writing published yourself including a profitable business model can be found in this book.
0800141660|5.0|Clear, light, balanced, easy to watch, and so beautifully made that there is always fresh pleasure seeing it again.   It may even be better (as a movie) than the book is (as a book).
0803731094|5.0|This book is wonderful!  Very popular in the UK for a while. It's a terrific lesson to children about how everybody is afraid sometimes, and that it's much better to be clever than big and scary.

B001AIRUOU|5.0|I remember seeing the trailers for \\"Nightmare\\"  all the way back in 1993.  And I was pumped.  But the folks said...\\"eh....maybe not.\\"  Then, the film disappeared for several years.  It was always that curiosity, that burning question of: \\"just what is so great about this film anyway?\\"  Then, there were the constant ads for it at Hot Topic, and Jack appearing on T-shirts left and right well over a decade later.      Like Jack, I found myself asking: \\"What's it mean?  What's it mean???\\"    Then, I finally saw it at a friend's house.  And wow.  It was...amazing!  Definitely something seasonal, and not to be overwatched, but a classic all the same.  Once I had the chance to add it to my own personal collection, I jumped on that chance.  I feared it could be a while before I got another one.  And even though I've seen it several times already, I still find something to catch my attention.  Special features are interesting too.
B005HSL626|2.0|for whatever reason it keeps resetting itself and deleting all of my data.. my high scores keep going kaput! why!?
B002ZG980U|5.0|Or a prequel.  Or something.  It's hard to believe something as good as Inception can remain self-contained forever.  This film opens up with the idea of dream hacking, and then shows what is possibly one of the most dangerous and inefficient ways to plant a thought in someone else's head.  After all, the Joker never needed a dream machine to corrupt Two-Face or get Batman to save the wrong victim.  Why does Cobb need the machine?  Details of logic aside, the film creates a world that is filled with possibilities, and that begs for expansion.  If not a sequel, than a prequel or spin-off.  Or something.  It's a world viewers will want to visit again and again.  Already, there are Facebook games based on the movie.  So maybe this wasn't the masterpiece that Dark Knight was.  But it has a charm all its own.  And it does what it does with a level of restraint not seen in The Matrix.  After Matrix, nobody really cared if there was a sequel or not.  With Inception, you're hungry for more.  It is both a strength and a problem for this movie: that one can hardly ever get enough of it.
B005EP1PJQ|4.0|After reading so much dark fantasy and dystopian, I was ready for something different.  Contemporary YA is not something that I read very often but I've seen a lot of praise for Anna and the French Kiss so I went ahead and bought it.  I wasn't disappointed!    I can't even imagine how terrifying it would be to be dropped off on your own, at a new school, in a country that you don't speak the language of, and without knowing anyone.  This is Anna's new world.  After her Nicolas Sparks father (yeah, that's pretty much who her dad's supposed to be... lol) decides she needs some more culture he ships her off to Paris.  Teenage insecurity ensues.    Miss Perkins does a great job of painting a picture of Paris and makes her readers try and calculate in their head how they are going to possibly afford to make it there.  I've honestly not been one that wanted to go to Paris but after reading this book, I'm SO ready to go!    Anna and St. Claire were cute and yet frustrating.  I wanted to smack St. Claire upside the head and tell him to dump his girlfriend as he was obviously in love with Anna and I wanted to smack Anna for being SOOO obsessed with St. Claire!  But... they were very cute and I could totally feel the heartache Anna was going through, pining away after him.      I highly recommend Anna and the French Kiss if you're wanting something that reads fast, is light hearted, and will make you go awwww!  4 out of 5 stars!
B005FUTBV4|1.0|I'm not against films that have allot of blood. My library includes 'Last of the Mohicans', 'Centurion', 'Saving Private Ryan', etc. But this flick reminded me of \\"The Devils Rejects\\". Just plain old pointless violence. Shooting everyone so the government won't have to explain anything? Farfetched at the least. The two kids getting getting killed about 3/4 of the way into this mess just sealed it. Waste of electrons bad film.  I'm usually not so impulsive. Maybe I was sleepy when I watched the trailer. Waste of $9.99 which I won't do again.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Thank goodness it was only $2.99, though I'd pay less.....the story moved so fast and well it just didn't feel like the master of horror stephen king wrote it. Overall i was pretty disappointed.
B005G48Y58|5.0|This was a great film with a young female lead which didn't focus on beauty, fashion or boys. I loved the concept of a female assassin.  Too bad she had to be genetically modified to make it believable.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I read this book when I was in eighth grade. I'd always loved reading, but nothing qualified as my \\"favorite book.\\" Nothing really inspired me to seek out like books until then.     I was ahead of the class, so my teacher recommended this book to me, and I went crazy over it. It was the first time that my eighth grade heart had ever broken over a character. I loved every single word written, and I loved Charlie/Charly so much. It was the first time I'd ever read a book and gotten into a trance because of it. The world was dead to me when I read it.    I finally managed to get my own copy. It's currently sitting next to me, and I hope to someday allow my future students to read it.     When I adopted my first pet rat the next summer, Algernon was definitely a name I considered. Unfortunately, \\"Juneau\\" was a more fitting name for the little fiend.
B0055EDBIE|5.0|It's Lenny what more to say! He still continues to make music that sets certain periods   in your life. Great album.
B004EFN6K8|5.0|Her Paris concert at the Olympia in 2001 is preserved as a music DVD, as her 2004 performance at the Montreal Jazz Festival, her 2008 performance at Rio de Janeiro, and her 2008 performance at the Jazzaldia Festival in San Sebastián, Spain, also are preserved, the last issued for the US market as In Concert Diana Krall Doing All Right. (As of this writing YouTube has her band's performance at the 2010 Montreaux Jazz Festival.)    Diana Krall is a treasure and a gift, born nine months after The Beatles' first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, and growing up to become a celebrated recording artist coincidentally in the same year the DVD was developed. These are accidents of fate, technology, destiny, and life. We are richer for having those early recordings of Louis Armstrong when recording and preserving music were the same age as Louis himself; and for the unplanned (and barely known) recording of Benny Goodman's 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert, which could not be accurately recreated until the LP record was developed in 1947 (in 1967: \\"It was twenty years ago today/Sergeant Pepper taught the band to play...\\"). That Benny Goodman concert recording was issued in 1950 as the first double-LP and quickly became the first million-selling LP recording. It has never gone out of print, being upgraded through each developing format.    Watching and listening to Diana Krall and her band, I sometimes realize I haven't taken a breath for long stretches.    The wonderful paradox: Jazz interpretations are never the same, while watching and listening to a recorded performance again (and again) means seeing and hearing the identical performance. Love means never wanting to eject.    So anything Diana records is worth my purchase and devotion, she being Diana and me being me (twisting Paul Anka a little: \\"You're so young, and I'm so old, this my 'darlin' I've been told, O please stay by me, Diana\\"). This music DVD, Doing All Right, is sloppy and with little to recommend, though Ilove it.    Amazon's product information identifies the video format as PAL (European TV standard), and the DVD as playable in Region 1 (US & Canada). However, the product itself identifies the video format as NTSC (North American TV standard) and lists \\"ALL\\" regions for the DVD codec. The product's case lists Dolby Digital Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, and DTS 5.1 Surround; but the DVD has no menu, has no input selection choices for sound output and decoding. My AV receiver decodes all audio formats as of 2009, and it defaulted to Dolby Digital Surround but would not change (except for simulated effects like Rock Arena) or 'read' the DTS encoding if it exists.    The video quality is substandard, literally: it's not even DVD Standard Definition. It looks like pretty good VHS tape (but not S-VHS quality). It might look okay if the playback system doesn't upscale to 1080p, but I haven't tried a direct playback to find out. I will try a lower resolution since the guitar strings sometimes show dragon's teeth all over them, a sure sign of upscaled resolution from lower definition.    The audio is quite good, no better than quite good, and I suspect the microphones and recording equipment are merely quite good, unlike the state-of-art definition we're accustomed to expect. Robert Hurst's bass is not full, and Jeff Hamilton's bass drum is practically absent unless he kicks it. Or maybe the DVD product was manufactured and copied poorly. I don't mind, but others might demand better.    The performance and the music. Diana's Live In Rio DVD performance was recorded in early 2008, while this Doing All Right DVD was recorded in late July of 2008, a few months later. It's fun to see her doing exploratory things at this San Sebastián performance that she probably chose not to do for the Rio DVD. A marketing decision? This DVD is not listed (or mentioned) at her official (Verve) web site. (The credits at the end are in Spanish; it's a legal recording but apparently not aDiana Krall authorized product, as it were.) Plus, for Rio she guarded her voice before the performance (making a music DVD at the highest level is a very expensive process), while here in Spain in late July after a day at the beach with her 19-month-old twin boys, she sounds sandier than she sounds sultry.    The DVD begins with Let's Fall In Love followed by The Look Of Love, after which Diana introduces the band (Anthony Wilson, guitar; Robert Hurst, standup bass; Jeff Hamilton, drums) and says the first song was written by Peggy Lee (huh?) and this song just played, by Burt Bacharach. Hmm. Maybe she's so used to opening with I Love Being Here With You, was nervous or overcome with jet lag, or the band did play the Peggy Lee song but the DVD didn't include it. New to me is watching Diana listening closely to Anthony Wilson; it's clearly visible how she concentrates and thinks.    Wilson and Hamilton seem to be out of sorts. If you've had extreme west-to-east jet lag, you might recognize the symptoms in those two musicians. Perhaps they ate lunch together and are feeling ill. Krall and Hurst appear fine and always jolly. But Hamilton and Wilson look like they're having some difficulty concentrating. Hamilton misses strokes and fills, loses his count and rhythm several times, and you can plainly see his displeasure with himself. Wilson also displays his frustration, but unlike those instances at some other times when he attempts something impossible and just misses the mark, in this performance he is trying to keep up, trying to make no mistakes, and he spends a lot of stage time listening when he looks like he knows he should be playing. It's not as if he's lost any of his excellence since at Montreaux two years later he plays better than ever.    At one point after a song Diana calls Anthony \\"the lovely Anthony Wilson\\", he goes \\"Hnn?\\" and she clarifies that his playing is lovely (which is pretty much the highest praise from artist to artist). Also new on this DVD is a nice camera shot high above and in front of Diana of a key light with a huge swarm of gnats or moths (it's not HD, so I can't tell which). And this time it's never obvious that Diana is reading the lyrics laid flat atop her Steinway. She pulls at the hem part of her dress several times to adjust it over her knees, rising off the leather or vinyl bench, and appears slightly uncomfortable. I think she still has her bathing suit on underneath, and you know that damp feeling, right?    Do not buy this DVD of Diana Krall for your first DVD of her and her band's performance. It deserves no more than one star, but it also contains some five-star stuff, and often. And because she's Diana Krall and can play everything, and play it uniquely, exquisitely, and lovely, and I'm me, I gave it five stars.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|This set is not the original theatrical releases of Star Wars, nor does it contain any remastering of the original theatrical releases.    This set is not the 1994 remastered \\"Special Editions\\" of Star Wars, nor does it contain any remastering of the 1994 \\"Special Editions\\".    This set contains even more edits, off-putting dialogue changes and additions, CGI-replacement of perfectly adequate physical models, and so forth. This set does not contain a single original Star Wars film.    If you want to see Star Wars in brilliant high-definition, then I recommend you buy the following DVDs:    Star Wars: Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (Two-Disc Widescreen Enhanced and Original Theatrical Versions) (1977)  The Empire Strikes Back: Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980 & 2004 Versions, Widescreen Edition) (1980)  The Return of the Jedi: Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983 & 2004 Versions, Two-Disc Widescreen Edition) (1983)    The versions linked above contain BOTH the original, unaltered, theatrical releases AND the 1994 \\"Special Editions\\". If you play them on a good Blu Ray player with a quality upscaler (or a PS3), they will probably look almost as good as any remastered Blu Ray release, and will contain absolutely ZERO Jar Jar Binks!
0307472841|1.0|This is one of the few books I have ever considered burning (out of sheer dislike), throwing across the room (the same), and panning.  If it's the translator's fault then they should be shot.  If not, then Henning has produced a way to fool people into reading something utterly dreadful.  THe mixture of politics and police procedural was ham-fisted at best.  I'm loathe to read another of his books to understand what the fuss is about but may have to get one from the library to do so.
1400032717|1.0|For starters, I read a review for this book in another book called \\"500 Must Read Books\\". It was listed in the childrens section, so I thought I'd check out a copy and see if it was something I could read to my kids. Good thing I did. After the second F bomb I quickly realized it wasn't what I consider a book for children. Add to that the fact that it deals with a dog impaled by a pitchfork. Heartwarming family fare.    By far the most disturbing element, for me at least, was the author's obvious use of a young autistic boy to expound his own philosophical and religious views. Autism is a serious condition and we are barely scratching the surface of it's pathology and how it affects the human brain. Are we to believe that because someone is autistic it gives them some special insight into morality and ethical questions that have been with us since the dawn of time? This character continually passes judgement on the religious views held by others. It's really not very respectful to the medical condition he was born with. In my opinion the author would show more integrity by writing a non-fiction essay on his atheistic views, instead of cloaking them in this so-called \\"children's\\" story.
B005HS00XW|3.0|Saw this in 3D as a special event at a theater. 3D was well done and flat DVD or Blu-ray will not have that. Secret World is one of my favorite DVDs so perhaps my expectations / hopes were unrealistically high. But this is Peter and an orchestra (New Blood), not an orchestra backed rock band. Peter practically speaks the lyrics to the early songs. Did not have the theatrics that Secret World had, OK but I was hoping for stellar.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|We've been on this road so long.  For those of us who grew up with the original Star Wars movies, and loved all the little details as much as the epic saga and larger than life characters, the last few decades have been torture.  They have actually been physically painful, to the point that I, who once owned a Boba Fett helmet and a scale Millenium Falcon replica, cannot bring myself to introduce the films to my children.  The problem is that George Lucas knows all we want is the original theatrical releases in a permanent, high quality format, and once we have them we will stop buying them or otherwise pay attention to his crazy alternate \\"official\\" versions.  So he will never give them to us, and instead keeps trying to foist off repackaged updates on an innocent public.<br /><br />At the same time, Mr. Lucas long ago forgot what it was that made the original films so great, if indeed he ever understood it at all.  Everyone has a breaking point when it comes to his changes.  For me, it was continuity-wrecking madness such as midichlorians and noxious genetic pre-requisites to become a Jedi, Lord Vader actually being a slave (?!) on Tatooine and burying his mother outside Luke's house (where her grave disappears), and actually cutting and pasting Hayden Christensen into the ending of Return of the Jedi instead of the grandfatherly and deeply satisfying image of Luke's real father we'd lived with for 20 years.  I still can't believe some of these things actually happened.<br /><br />For others, it may be Ewok eyelids, or weird-colored lightsabers, or inserted CGI creatures flailing away, or something else that just seems so horribly wrong that it shakes your faith that whoever made the change had any idea what they were doing.  For years, I listened to the (few) devotees of the Prequels try to defend all of Lucas's changes to the original films as \\"improvements\\" or \\"updates\\" or the like, secure in their knowledge that he would never ever change the Prequels they loved, since he had all the time and money and technology in the world to get those right the first time.  Well, guess what -- welcome to Revision Town, population You.  Those prequels are going under the knife for real this time, and it is just starting.  Like a 60-something Hollywood actress who has to start getting more and more plastic surgery to fix the earlier plastic surgery that turned out to be a bad idea, not only will Lucas not stop changing things, the pace is actually speeding up.  These films are well on their way towards being just as grotesque, frightening, and unrecognizable as those plastic surgery addicts.<br /><br />This raises the ultimate question:  why buy this blu-ray set at all?  It is your money, and you can spend it as you please.  However, it is wholly naive to think that what you buy today will be the same \\"official\\" version of the films that exists in Lucas's head and the ILM hard drives even the following morning, let alone years from now.  You are buying products that are, simply put, much inferior to the originals, and that have built in expiration dates keyed to whenever Mr. Lucas needs more money.  Next time, will the Millenium Falcon be polka-dotted, and Princess Leia a bearded lady with a dubbed baritone?  Who knows.  Over the years, we've all thought \\"there's no way he'd go that far,\\" and then suddenly Lord Vader is wearing 6-inch Battlefield Earth boots because the actor is too short, or he ends up strangling Amidala after going to the Dark Side out of fear Amidala would die.  We lost all adherence to reason and rationality long ago.  The only control the long suffering fans have is over our pocket books, and it is time at last to exercise it.  May the real Force be with you.ad all the time and money and technology in the world to get those right the first time.  Well, guess what -- welcome to Revision Town, population You.

1594744769|5.0|I really enjoyed this story and passed it on to a friend! Good writing, lovable characters, and I am eagerly awaiting a second book!
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Given all the hype I've seen about this, I was surprised that it wasn't better and more original. The plot is pretty standard: underdog fights incredible odds and learns valuable lessons along the way. Much of the talk about the book focuses on the many (many) geek cultural references--mainly from the 80s, but reaching from the 50s to Firefly--strewn through the text. They are fun, but I would have appreciated them more if they were explained a little less; they're not allusions, they're citations. The world-building is laborious and yet slight, with long explanations of how brilliant it all is. There was one point where I was actually intrigued by the plot, only to have the tension thrown away on a quick escape. The characters are straight out of an 80's movie, as is the resolution. In the end, this is about as much fun as listening to someone tell you about this great D&D campaign they once played.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|This definately is not the same Kid Rock my kids and myself when only God knows why came out. It's a mellow Kid and he sounds terrific. Am showing my age by saying remember The Donnie and Marie Show-a little bit country a little bit rock n roll states what you'll hear. It's worth the purchase if u like Kid. I like him better this way and even went to see him in concert and he made an appearance when we went to see Bob Segar. You'll enjoy

B0019N94X6|1.0|Not even thirty seconds in, and it's obvious Al Pacino's SCARFACE is acutely unaware it's been positioned as a future camp classic:  outrageously over-the-top Al, affecting an uproariously exaggerated Cuban accent and playing a character whose every other word begins with \\"F,\\" delivers a go-for-broke performance that best approximates a freebasing Daffy Duck.  Decked out in garish polyester suits that would make Tony Manero blush, Pacino annunciates every line of Oliver Stone's trashy script as if someone has slipped a freshly-fired horseshoe down his hot designer pants; it would be another eleven years before Rod Steiger would showcase an even more embarrassing Cuban accent in 1994's THE SPECIALIST.    Released in the midst of a particularly fallow period of Pacino's career (his comedy AUTHOR! AUTHOR! wasn't half as funny as his Civil War epic, REVOLUTION) SCARFACE serves as a reminder that even the finest of actors have their \\"off\\" days.  Pacino and director Brian DePalma would fare far better with CARLITO'S WAY a decade later.
0811876373|5.0|I originally saw this book in Barns & Noble.  The price was outragious.  I knew to look into it on Amazon and was pleasantly surprise of their price for the book, plus the Super Save option.  I absolutely LOVE THIS BOOK!!!  Thank you so much to Amazon for the opportunity to get this from them.
B001GCUO4S|1.0|While still as bloody & gorey as ever before,its still just the same stuff you saw in the other F.D. films. Like Jurassic Park 2,its just filler until death comes. Like Jaws 3D,The 3D doesn't really work in there and gets really annoying after awhile. This film has more recurring cliche characters then a Stephen King mini-series. This movie also has the most over-the-rope & silliest deaths this side of The Tommyknockers. Overall,Its just the same stuff you saw in the first 3 films again & again. I give this film a 1 out of 10.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|wonderful movie everything was as everyone told me it was. I really enjoyed it and watch it several times.  It usually is one of my travel movies.  I love Jessie Eisenberg great actor.
B00596WEVI|4.0|Having resigned myself to accepting the Van Damme heyday was over and the remainder of his career would be limited to less than average DTV releases, along comes Assassination Games to revive my crestfallen heart and   prove low budget action does not have to be mindless, derivitive, and action-less abhorrations of film where the producer's only goal was to create a 90 minute timeline that could be packaged and labeled as a 'movie.'    While many are quick to categorize this film as standard action fare, nothing about it is standard: the dialogue, while just a notch above average, is coherent and well paced; the direction is competent; and the supporting players can actually act, entertaining you when the leads aren't on screen.  I disagree with the reviewer who stated the lead villain (Polo Yakur, played by Ivan Kaye), was nothing more than a 'typical' heavy, because Kaye - while admittedly serving a narrow spectrum in the film - did inflect subtleties to make the character seem a grieving human being rather than just another over the top villain strutting around for the sake of malevolence.      It's true there isn't much fighting in this movie, but the fighting that is present serves purpose rather than being a fight scene dropped into the storyline simply to satisfy machismo.  Because this movie works, you don't pine for more fighting or action, you want to see what happens to the characters.  You become transfixed on the action but are satisfied with an even bigger bang when you learn where the action is leading.  It's a mix that we rarely see in any DTV release nowadays, and I'm surprised this film was not given wider distribution in theaters.      As a Jean-Claude Van Damme film, I'm happy to say it is, beyond doubt, the best he has done in a long time.  While The Shepard was watchable despite its predictable flaws, even die hard fans must admit to disappointment during a long dry spell of DTV crap where the only saving grace was Van Damme himself, lost amidst amateurish, no-talent schlock.  With this single film, his heinous mistakes of the past - Derailed, Until Death, etc - are forgotten and forgiven.  As a Scott Adkins film, it shows how good an actor he can be, thank goodness, something desperately needed in this genre  when the action hero isn't kicking somebody around.    As a team, the two performed well together and, I daresay, I'd be happy to see those two characters together again in a sequel. By the end of the film they have bonded and earned respect from each other, which is just the beginning for far more.
1932100660|5.0|I am not a nutritional expert and yet, the more I read on the subject and experience, I am convinced that we need to make radical shifts in our diets.  I personally had a cholesterol reading of 240 and then dropped to a total vegan diet and now my cholesterol is 168.  I think this book puts the facts and observations of whole communities and their diets out there as evidence that we need to change our thinking about diet.    I think the time has come to understand the complex relationship between food manufacturing, advertising, our healthcare industry, how typical research is funded, etc. to understand just what is at stake unless we make some fundamental changes to our lifestyle.     It is a must read for anyone concerned with health, our aging population, and our children.
0439023521|3.0|I tried to read this book when it first came out and put it aside once I realized it was about kids killing kids. My own kids prevailed, however, telling me I'd enjoy it once I got into it. I finished the book and wondered why the book has been so popular? Yes, the concept is cool and different, but the characters were so flat and forgettable I couldn't really have cared how the book ended. Nor do I care about what happens in book$$ two and three. No $urpri$e WHY those were written.<br /><br />To each his own, though. Just because I consider this more hype than memorable, doesn't mean the next person won't love it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I want you to take a moment to think about something. Think about something in your life that you created. Think about something that was your vision, your art, etc. Did you not want to perfect this art of yours? Did you not want to reiterate it until you felt satisfied? Most artists never feel satisfied, and to sit here and spew your distaste for a collection you have not even seen yet is indicative of how entitled of a society we are. This is NOT your art. This is not YOUR product. Feel free to review it poorly, but take your subjective bull out of your reviews, and give it an honest look based on the changes, as ART as a whole, not because it wildly violates your image of what Star Wars should be. Remember this. Star Wars is made by George Lucas. Not you...    So please, take more than a few moments to get over yourselves and actually review the item for what it is. George Lucas trying to perfect (to his vision) of what he wanted to do with Star Wars when he first had a chance years and years ago. Ewok's not blinking. You're going to get mad over that? Vader crying out in pain saying no, when he sees his son being put to near the same fate of Mace Windu? These are all acceptable changes that help to shore up a lot of the inconsistencies of the movies. For all those people who gave it 1's before they got to see the final product. Shame on you.    I for one will always know what I love about Star Wars, and it isn't the exact movie cuts, or the format, or if Han shot first. It's about how it makes me feel inside, and how wild my imagination goes when I think about it. How I have grown up with it throughout the years, and played near 100% of the Star Wars games released. It's apart of me, and I review the product as a whole piece of unfinished art that George is slowly trying to get how he feels is complete.     Show a little heart next time, please.
0307272702|5.0|This book pulls back the curtain on how conventional wisdom on diet became the conventional wisdom. It is well thought out, easy to digest and eye opening. Everybody who eats should read this book.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|This movie is well cast and well acted; the cast headed up by Jack Nicholson, Keanu Reeves, and Diane Keaton does a splendid job which permits the viewer to develop a concern for the characters and a desire that all will work out well for each of them.<br /><br />There are a lot of laughs as well as touching situations to which many will be able to relate. The movie is well paced and seems to go by quickly. There is beautiful scenery which always contributes to the enjoyment of the movie.<br /><br />Although funny and entertaining for mature adults I can in no wise recommend this movie for the entire family. It presents ideas and situations which are not suitable for children and does not promote high moral values.
0316286850|5.0|I picked up this books from a friend. I really liked its big size and full color photos. I did not just glace at the photos, I actually read the entire book.    Kevyn does a really great job of encouraging the reader to experiment with makeup, and not just with colors, but also with the way you apply it, location, tools, and more. He does a GREAT job of summarizing styles throughout the decades and gives you step-by-step instructions with color and makeup suggestions for you to replicate the looks. I especially loved the history of the \\"Eyebrow\\" (30s thin brows)and \\"lip\\" (50s full lip). I really loved the \\"film noir\\" and \\"hollywood bombshell\\" looks.    What was REALLY great about this book is the expansive amount of celebrity photos that Kevyn used, everyone from Vanessa Williams, to Drew Barrymore, to Demi Moore. If I had not seen the step by step directions for some of the looks, I would have NEVER guessed who it was! He REALLY surprised the reader about what can be accomplished with the correct and playful application of makeup.    His \\"transformations\\" of normal people to make-up styles were really inspirational.    Also, a BIG plus, is that Kevyn was not afraid to use women of all colors, black white, asian, whatever.    What I found a bit boring about the book is how similar many of the looks are. He had a lot of browns, peach, tuapes. I would have loved to see more vibrant looks, like Green eyeshadow, blue lipstick, a mardi gras look, vampire costume look, punk or goth, and some REALLY fun, maybe even halloween-inspired looks. I'm not saying he had to go nuts with special effects makeup, but a bit more diversity in coloring would have been nice. More FUN stuff and more color.    This is still a FANTASTIC book that I recommend to ANY makeup lover.

B002PQ7JQK|1.0|Perhaps I do wrong to put down this Blu-Ray set without seeing it, but after hearing that Star Trek has been CGIed, I said to myself....Crap...NOTHING is sacred anymore...    In short, if this set does not contain the original unaltered versions, I won't buy it...  The new versions might be a curiosity and provide a new perspective of the originals, but that is the extent of it.  As for me, I want to see the Tholians build that web the old way, and my stomach turns to think they altered it.  The next thing they'll want to do is CGI the crew out of those classic Red uniforms...and CGI Bill Shatner out of the captain's chair and replace him with Kate Mulgrew (who the hell is she?)...LOL
0545259088|5.0|This trilogy has been absolutely outstanding.  When I read [[ASIN:0545123275 Shiver (Wolves of Mercy Falls)]], I couldn't wait for [[ASIN:0545123291 Linger (Wolves of Mercy Falls, Book 2)]] to arrive.  While awaiting Linger, I was offered to review Forever.  I couldn't believe my luck.  I wish this trilogy of books didn't have to end.  I don't usually go for the Fantasy type of books, although I do enjoy a good romance.  This trilogy hooked me in, and I couldn't put it down until I was finished.  I am left hoping for a TV series or more books!  I am a 36 year old woman in love with a Young Adult trilogy!
B005JN988I|5.0|Loved this episode. Lots of funny laughs.      The new character was interesting and one can see how River grows from there.   Very sexy and sassy.  I wish she had stayed longer.  But the River we know was really funny upon regeneration.  We are learning lots about her and I hope we learn more.  Amazing sacrifice she made.  I don't know why she made it since it went against her programming.  But it was a good ending.  Also, we learn who the Silence is and what they want.  I look forward to the Doctor trying to find out what the question is.    Loved it.    I guess they never actually find her so that Amy and Rory raise her rather than growing up with her.  ~sigh~  But who knows.    The writers have amazing imaginations.
B004IFYMWK|4.0|Doug Liman, whose reputation is probably made due to his association with the Bourne Identity/Ultimatum movies, helms this project.  When I saw this DVD in the video store, it had completely missed my radar screen.  The film will be controversial for some because of the politics and the historical recency of the Bush administration and the Iraq war.  As a film, it has been derided because of its emphasis on the relationship between Wilson and his wife.  While my perception is that the film balances well between the politics and intrigue of the Iraq War and the home situation, it is made FAR more interesting because it so greatly points out the impact the events had on a real family.  It also points to the value of the individual to stand up and say what is true in a democracy; reference the scene Sean Penn addresses a class at the end.  Sean Penn is a Master actor.  I never would have predicted this when I watched \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High,\\" but with the choices he has made and the incredible diversity from performances in \\"Milk,\\" \\"I Am Sam\\" and \\"Mystic River,\\" now I ALWAYS watch his work.  He does an amazing job in \\"Fair Game,\\" showing us a driven civil servant who stands up for what he believes is right and a husband in love with his wife.  I also greatly appreciated the blending of reality that Liman does by having clips from the real-life Valerie Plame as well as the media footage of Condoleezza Rice talking about aluminum tubes.  It's so well done.  Naomi Watts turns in a strong performance in a challenging role that demanded a wide range of emotional territory.  The scene where the two reclaim their marriage is powerful and reflects for me how even names we see in the news are people.  David Andrews as Scooter Libby was sufficiently creepy.  I thought this was a very strong film and was surprised at finding out the cool reception it received.  I liked it!  Enjoy!
B005L7B22C|4.0|Good episode, but not as good as the Let's get Hitler episode.  No new character development for any of the main characters.  This felt like a filler episode like that pirate one . . . kind of a break from the River story and the search for who and what the Silence is.    Those dolls were crazy creepy.  And that poor kid!  Scared of everything but primarily of being rejected and alone.  Good actor.  Loved the little old lady, too.    I like the idea that there is a beacon that scared children can use to call the Doctor.  No wars.  No enemies.  Just a scared child.  Aw!  Okay, a scared child who created crazy creepy doll things.  ~shiver~
B003ZSJ212|2.0|I really was looking forward to this! But I cancelled my pre-order.  Why?<br /><br />1) People in the know are saying the transfer is not worthy of Bluray.  I have the Special Edition DVDs which look great on my HiDef TV, so why bother?<br />2) These so-called \\"improvements,\\" such as the Darth Vader dialogue at the climax of Return of the Jedi, are stupid. Plain and simple, stupid.<br />3) This is such an obvious money-grab and I am through giving Lucasfilms my money for these films.<br />4) They will eventually land in the bargin-bin anyway, so I might consider picking it up then to see if anything was actually different.<br /><br />I was 13 when the original Star Wars film (it was just Star Wars, not Episode IV A New Hope) was in theaters and it simply blew me away.  I am now 49.  I am not trying to \\"relive my childhood\\" and do not have a childish need for these movies to be exactly what I saw back then, BUT it is obvious that this Bluray set is marketed for us older fans - not for the kids.<br /><br />With that in mind, Lucasfilms could have done the decent thing and presented the originals as extras on this set.  And, they should have fixed ALL the quality issues in Bluray.  They arrogantly chose not to.  That is NOT the way to value your fans.  It just seems so simple, but the numbnuts at Lucasfilms just don't understand this basic concept. I don't need to pay them for this and neither do you.

I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in knowing what it's really like to be a professional multi-tasker. Also, I just realized that this book is going to be turned into a movie with Sarah Jessica Parker. Super excited about that! I've loved SJP since \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\\" I know.

B002BE7JEI|4.0|This film holds up well.  It's both suspenseful and funny, and Bates' Oscar-winning performance is still fun to watch.  The surround sound and picture quality won't win any awards, but it definitely looks better than its DVD counterpart.
0380730405|1.0|I am an avid reader, and I have never disliked a book and every character in it so much.  The author overindulges in minutiae to the extreme expense of a plot.  I would have trashed this book after 100 pages had it not come recommended by a good friend.  Truly, every character is insufferable - Maxim is an ass who treats his (2nd) wife as if she was a small child, the 2nd wife is utterly spineless, the elderly companion at the beginning is a pretentious bore, the housekeeper is a sadistic, controlling bitch.  There really just isn't anything at all to like about this book, and I'm completely at a loss to understand why on earth people seem to rate it highly.  I can only assume they're comparing it to Harlequin Romances and not actual well-written literature.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This is a worthwhile buy.  I really enjoyed the story and setting.   Its a compelling piece set on Cairnhorn Island and cleverly warps between two worlds. This is a setup for at least a second, if not a third book.  But the action and dialogue roll nicely.   The author is a good writer.  Not a great writer.  Slight tendency to \\"write on the nose.\\" I hope the author pushes beyond this as it is probably the single thing that could transcend the author into a GREAT writer.  All the rest is excellent storytelling.
B000005GWE|5.0|When I was 16 years old, I took a jazz improv course at my high school and started learning how to play jazz guitar. My teacher strongly emphasized the importance of listening: 'go out and buy records! listen and study the greats!' one friday night, i went out with my dad to a local record store in nashville, the great escape, and he picks out this record for me.     after a couple listens, it doesn't quite sink in. it's too much, and after all, i'm only just beginning to learn this music. even though i didn't understand what they were doing, i knew that this was a higher level of artistry going on between two virtuoso musicians, not competing for a spotlight but REALLY listening to each other and making music. coupled with a superb rhythm section in the joint efforts of bill stewart and steve swallow, i had been officially introduced to jazz music. this was the record that started EVERYTHING for me.    as the years have passed, i understand much better what makes this album so great. for starters, the compostions are all beautiful and varying in their concepts and themes, including tunes laced with straight-ahead (\\"sco\\"), bossa (\\"say the brothers name\\"), classical (\\"message to my friend\\", and free jazz (\\"no way jose\\"). this is a GREAT album for any guitar player wanting to gain insight into the minds of two great guitar players. In my opinion, this is some of metheny's finest playing ever. every Metheny solo on this album is a complete story in itself, with no 'extra' notes or unwanted flash: perfectly to-the-point and stunningly beautiful (listen to \\"the red one\\" and \\"say the brother's name\\"). Scofield is equally great in a completely different way, providing more of the 'grit' which is more-or-less absent in metheny's playing. both player's styles stand out on their own yet never conflict with one another. they compliment each other very well.    I owe this recording a great deal. It introduced me to so much and continues to do so with each listen. as time goes by and musical preferences come-and-go, this recording remains a constant in my life. an essential and important recording. thanks dad...

Set in \\"old time\\" London, where thieves and villains were commonplace, I felt I was taken back in time through Sarah Waters excellent literary writings. The book was extremely addictive reading, there was many a night I could not draw myself away from reading it and go to sleep. Susan, the main character in the book is a naive, but lovable rogue who narrates the events that came to pass that changed her life forever. The book had so many twists and turns, and I was enthralled by every paged I turned. I highly recommend this book, it was an absolute pleasure to read![[ASIN:1573229725 Fingersmith]]
B005COO1X6|5.0|I've been reading Mr. King for years and this story, for me, is classic. I felt the familiar rush of excitement I always get when turning to the first page of a new book or story. I wasn't disappointed. What starts off as a normal day in a 10 year old's life turned into, \\"How can this be happening?\\"  I love how normal turns into unbelievable. I love how routine turns into madness. I love that even when you come to the end the story could continue on and on. I care about what happens next. I love it!    Thank you Mr. King!
1563898586|3.0|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is Allan Moore's tale of British literary characters banding together to save England in the late 19th century. The artwork is fantastic. It is stylized to reflect the art of the period, and I love it! The writing is good, but not Moore's best. It is written to mimic the fun of the early serialized adventure comics. It can be funny and/or fun at times, yet I don't always find Moore's humor amusing (sometimes just crass). He does, however, create a unique team of heroes (or antiheroes) with interesting personalities. Each is different--some disturbingly so--and the lone gentlewoman on the team is by far the best reason to pick up this book.<br /><br />Main character Mina Murray is a strong-willed woman in a world controlled by men. That type of character often appears in fiction, but I find them to act like modern women and the men often just accept them. Miss Murray proves her realism as she struggles to lead four strong men who are unaccustomed to taking orders--especially from a woman. I can't do her character justice, but Moore does. If you like female characters who can hold their own in a male-dominated society without flaunting their sexuality: she's your girl.<br /><br />Gentlemen is a decent read, but not as epic as I've come to expect from Moore. It also contains some gore and adult content, sometimes for laughs, but call me crazy: I don't find rape amusing. There is a lot to love here, but I'd only recommend this to those who want more Moore after reading such titles as Watchmen and V for Vendetta, or those who are looking for a shorter Moore work before taking on one of his longer, more serious titles.

0345522478|5.0|Hounded, by Kevin Hearne, tackled me and held me hostage for a full day. I couldn't put it down until I turned the final page.    It's innovative. the protagonist, an ancient druid, invented magic that has kept him alive for over 20 centuries. He's seen it all, but enthusiastically searches for more.    He has a unique sidekick, an enormous hound that he has bonded with. They communicate through the bond and the hound has some of the best lines. In this case sharing the stage with a dog really works.    It's action packed. Minor and major gods are at war, and Atticus O'Sullivan is in the middle. Every time he turns around a new antagonist surfaces. Some want something he has. Others want to make sure he keeps it.    It's educational. Kevin Hearne fills it with the right amount of information on the ancient gods wandering and warring in the midst of us mortals. It'll make you watch over your shoulders.    It's smoothly written. Competently and professionally scribed. You'd think he'd studied the English language extensively. Huh, what's that? A high school English teacher. OK, I guess he has.    It's a great read, buy it, you'll like how it reads, I guarantee it.
B00275EGWY|5.0|This is an action packed film that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The characters are propelled from one risky situation to the next without much of a break between. The film is about a bomb removal or disposal unit who must deal with the vast proliferation of IEDs set by the insurgents for our young soldiers. The fact that these IEDs are produced using diverted military supplies is beyond tragic incompetence.      Jeremy Renner is superb as Sergeant James, a fascinating character who seems driven for many reasons to take outrageous risks when dismantling IEDs. He is contrasted with Sergeant Sanborn, the voice of reason and experience, which is highly annoyed by excessive risk taking. Most viewers would identify with Sergeant Sanborn's common sense in the face of ever changing risks. A third fellow, Specialist Eldridge, is also a character with whom many may identify, for he knows that war in Iraq had become insane and he struggles to mentally hold himself together under the stress.    I found this film to be highly entertaining with a compelling story and realistic characters in challenging situations. I loved Black Hawk Down and found this film to be as good a film. A year in the life of a bomb disposal unit would be a terrible year for each day presented new life threatening situations, often ambiguous signals, and ever changing risks. When I read the other reviews, particularly those folks who gave the film low marks, I found that most of the complaints were highly technical and detail oriented. In other words, for the film to get it right, every detail about military operations must be exactly portrayed. I am not sure I agree with this since the essence of the film, the messages conveyed, seemed authentic and fair. The American soldiers were portrayed with a sense of fair play and balance. I actually found some of the negative reviews to be educational, particularly those reviewers who have served in Iraq and who had detailed criticism of various aspects of the film. But these same reviewers rarely concerned themselves with the underlying character development and sequence of events that came together in this portrayal of one slice of the war in Iraq.     The film does an excellent job of conveying the almost impossible task our soldiers faced in a country undergoing a civil war and filled with insurgency. In civil war horrors are inflicted on citizens by citizens, as gruesomely conveyed in scenes in this film. When dealing with insurgency, it is impossible to tell if the man smiling at you is about to kill you, again as this film perfectly portrayed. The film also stays away from politics and political statements and it does this by focusing on the Iraqi people and settings and the American soldiers and their predicaments. In actuality, this made more of a moral and ethical statement than any political statement could make.

030788743X|5.0|This is the second book that I read in under 24 hours, the first being Harry Potter VII.  It is exciting, engaging, and entertaining, to be sure.  It is also more well rounded, better written, and more accessible than I would have ever assumed, given that it is about a group of MMORPG players obsessed with 80's pop culture.    I highly recommend this, regardless of your level of geek-hood.

B005CMSDLE|5.0|The title of this review is a twice stated comment from Hanna - the first when she shoots a dear with her bow and arrow and the second at the end when the arrow is aimed at a significant human character.  But actually the quote could summarize the response of most people who watch this strange film  Written by newcomers Seth Lochhead and David Farr and directed by Joe Wright who has 'The Soloist', 'Atonement', and 'Pride & Prejudice' to his credits, the problem with the film is the telling of the story: the whole thing makes sense at the end but before that the audience is left in somewhat of a quandary as to who is who and where is where  and why the whole thing is progressing the way it does.  Thankfully the entire concept is resolved in the closing minutes - and anyone who shares those secrets in a review would be doing a disservice to those who will encounter this gripping, action-packed thriller.<br /><br />The story opens in the forest in winter in Finland: teenage Hanna (Saoirse Ronan, an actress who is maturing very well indeed) lives with her father Erik (Eric Bana), an ex-CIA agent who has devoted his life sequestered with his daughter to raise her to be the perfect soldier.  They spar, challenge each other's fighting skills, hunt, share books, all the wile Erik is making Hanna memorize data about being from the Grimm house (as in the Brothers Grimm) in Berlin. At a certain point Hanna feels she is ready to go into the real world on her 'mission' and Erik changes his hunter costume for a suit and departs also (a strange signal box is turned on that will alert Erik's past confreres as to his return.  From this point we follow Hanna into many strange places including an interrogation chamber which seems totally foreign to her and tricks her into thinking her skills have accomplished her mission of killing one Marissa (Cate Blanchett).  Hanna escapes and continues her journey across Europe, Morocco, and unnamed places, all the while on the run and practicing her well-informed assassin skills.  She is followed by Marissa, and by the bizarre Isaacs (Tom Hollander) and his companion CIA Tech #1 (Paris Arrowsmith).  Hanna meets quite by accident a family on vacation -the hippie mother Rachel (Olivia Williams), the father Sebastian (Jason Flemyng) and their two children Sophie (Jessica Barden in a superb role as Hanna's only friend) and Miles (Aldo Maland). As the enemy closes in on Hanna and her adopted family, Hanna must leave and head for Berlin, all the while Erik is making his way toward Berlin, desiring to face Marissa with the secrets of Hanna's beginnings as a human experiment. And form that point the story must be guarded from those who must figure out the ending for themselves.<br /><br />Saoirse Ronan and Eric Bana give superb performances: Cate Blanchett seems oddly miscast here, having a difficult time figuring out which of her accents belongs to the monochromatic role. This is not a film for those who need linear storytelling: the  film does jump around a bit seemingly in search of a story, but that all comes to pass in the film's end. It is a brainy movie, well made, and one that keeps the viewer on the edge of the seat, scratching the head, until the final minutes.  Grady Harp, September 11l-informed assassin skills.

B004RSCWZ2|1.0|After listening to this album I was very disappointed and surprised with all the positive reviews.  This is a boring, vanilla, insipid collection of music that does not come close to the excitement and energy of the other Derek Trucks albums without Tesedsci.  this sounds like a a solo Susan Tesedsci album with a collection of unmemorable and indistinguishable music.  Trucks hardly goes off at all and the 11 piece band is a total waste and pretty much in the background.  Derek Trucks is an extremely talented and unique player who's talent is completely wasted on this throw away effort
B005J7K950|5.0|All those years I've been hanging on to my VHS copy of this version, now finally it's coming out in (hopefully) good quality. Many people hate this film, or rather this edition, but I liked it then and still do.<br />Metropolis would probably have sunk into total oblivion, had not Giorgio Moroder generated new interest in this classic by presenting it to a new audience.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Good game, but this updated for the iphone a month and a half ago, hope we can expect the android version updated soon.     'Til then, it's too quick and easy to beat to merit more than four stars.
B00005JKTF|3.0|The acting is excellent, and the use of English throughout is not really shocking.<br />I would have rated this movie 5 stars as it portrays the French dilemma under the occupation with anguishing reality: betrayal, opportunism, collaboration,lack of humanity. A really depressing look at humanity, although rays of hope shine through in the personalities of the Charlotte and her Communist resistance hero.<br />The ending, however, did me in....<br />Her English pilot boyfriend, finally recovered alive, is briefly tossed aside in an unconvincing short scene, and Charlotte skips back to liberated France to live the rural dream with her resistance companion...shades of` Utopia under the Tuscan sun` or the young lady and the Continent. Not worthy of the rest of the movie.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I used to backup George Lucas.  In the days before \\"the Internet\\", the man could do no wrong.  Not only was he hands down the creator of the best movie trilogy in the history of cinema, but he also gave us Indiana Jones, American Graffiti, and sunk more of his own money into his own dream; creating modern day special effects, promoting digital technology to enhance the motion picture experience and forever changing the way we enjoy entertainment.  I would dare you to try better.    But George.  This is it.  The last time you suckered me in with the newly cleaned print, albeit with even more changes.  And some outright quality control issues to be perfectly honest.  How many different prints could you have to rescued Moff Tarkin's line from??  Reversing stereo channels?  Really?  Is it the third grade there at Lucasfilm?    So NO.  I learned my lesson last time, and you've obviously proven me right again.  Star Wars will have to remain in my memories, rather than on my shelf.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Lucas has made the movie equivalent of a 60 year old lady that can't get enough plastic surgery; the more they get hacked on, the harder they are to look at.      I prefer the lesser video and audio quality of my original VHS than the DVD or BR versions that have been destroyed at the hands of Lucasfilm.  Thanks but no thanks - I'm not interested in George's latest cash grab.

0525422943|2.0|I'm afraid I have to join the minority that is just plain disappointed with this book. Most of it dragged on, felt pointless, and lacked the genuinely evoked emotion of the first book. For me the writing was hit or miss...some of the dialogue, especially in scenes with the band, was just laughably stiff and inauthentic. The point of view switch to Adam just flat out didn't work for me. However, the ending gave this book one extra star for me. Though the resolution was too pat for my taste, the emotion and the language reminded me why I loved IF I STAY and why I bought the sequel to begin with. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite enough to warrant a re-read or even a permanent spot on my shelves...this one will be getting passed on.
B004LWZWEC|5.0|I've waited for this for a long time. Picture is all cleaned up, the sound is great. The only let down is half way through Walk All Over You they cut the song. The same as on the video. Thought they would sort that out.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The problem with the changes is more than just the fact that they're fixing that which wasn't broken. It's the fact that they're grossly incongruous and don't integrate well at all with the original films. Vader's \\"Nooooo\\" is easily recognizable as being recycled from Episode 3 for instance. However, it's the awful color timing from the 2004 editions that we were promised would be fixed that haven't been corrected.    Why would we be promised this was done only to have the blu rays unveiled with virtually none of the color timing issues fixed? I.e white colorless lasers being fired from the star destroyer in the opening shot. Yet time was found to further sully the classic films with more idiotic tweaks.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|If you are a \\"trekkie\\" this was an outstanding movie. In my opinion, one of the best Star Trek movies yet.  Director J.J. Abrams did an outstanding job. The cast is young, exciting, and very well selected. Roddenberry would have been proud!  The scenes are fast-paced, marvelously realistic, and engaging to watch. The story line folds back on itself to make a story that has not been seen in ANY Star Trek episode or movie to bare the name. The excitement is fast-paced and visually enticing, in a Star WARS sort of way, but with the \\"Star Trek\\" expectations that any trek-lover would appreciate. The musical score and sound effects are sensational, new and refreshing... finally ending with the finest rendition of the Original Star Trek score I have heard.<br /><br />As Sci-Fi movies go, I believe anyone that is Sci-Fi inclined will love this movie. If you're a Sci-Fi fanatic AND a big Star Trek fan, I will nearly guarantee you enjoy this fresh take with a well-played nod to the original.
0545128285|5.0|very nice collection.  I would like to see it expanded.  I found the comments at the end of the stories as interesting as the stories themselves
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|Love it; worked perfectly. HTC thunderbolt. Really fun and engaging, the casting is fun, but hold onto your phone! Twenty
B004LK5CEE|3.0|Yes, the extended version (supposedly titled \\"Untitled\\", but presented here as \\"The Bootleg Cut\\") is a wonderful, immersive experience that is a lot of fun to watch for people who love this very lovable film. But for the uninitiated, as well as anyone who prefers the tighter theatrical cut, or would like to compare the two versions, or to occasionally be able to watch the film with slightly less of a time commitment, or just relive their original experience of seeing the film in the theater... THIS SUCKS. It's been an \\"exclusive\\" at Best Buy for months, and I got it there because the deliberately misleading package says this disc \\"includes\\" the extended cut. \\"Includes\\"? You mean FEATURES! \\"Includes\\" means IN ADDITION to something else, presumably the original cut. As there was no specific mention of the original cut on the package, I kind of expected that it was not also \\"included\\", but it still irked me to have that confirmed when I got home.     As I said in the review title, in another year or two you can definitely expect an \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" or some such, containing both films (as well as, probably, the 6-song Stillwater EP that came with the DVD release of \\"Untitled\\" -- which, ahem, DID \\"include\\" the original film as well). So, if you can wait indefinitely to own this (un)title on Blu, you could just wait for that to eventually materialize. That said, the extended cut does look and sound terrific on this disc. Oh well, what are ya gonna do.
B000000SDB|3.0|This isn't the first time I've disagreed with David Hurwitz. I'm amazed this set has gotten so much praise.  I find it choppy, noisey, steely - except for 6 which is mellow but still not a top choice. I don't care for the vibrato-less strings which sound rather sterile. Why has Beethoven become so angry and punchy in recent years?
0711974594|5.0|There is another listing for this book [[ASIN:0634022296 The Beatles Complete Chord Songbook]]with 160 reviews and an average star rating of about 4.5, so don't pay much attention to the crappy combined rating here. Most reviewers are quite happy with this book. As one of the most helpful reviews says, it does exactly what it promises.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This device can get a really dull knife to a serviceable sharpness but can't seem to get a truly fine edge on any of my knives.  Overall a decent sharpener but you will need to get a nice stone to put a fine cutting edge on your knife.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|Works very well on my EVO 4G. Surprisingly clear pdf docs. Was very pleased with how intuitive app seems (so far, so good)!
B005C9YZKU|5.0|As I write this, there is only one other review for this series (this version of it anyway) with one star as a scolding for the packaging. While I agree the globe and color cards are a bit on the elaborate side, it could be argued that fancy packaging is only a waste if it's meant to be discarded. In this case, it's obviously meant to be kept and displayed. It does look less user-friendly to me than standard disc cases though. Regardless, the series itself is stellar. Five stars!
B002VHI8FE|4.0|I thought this was a good read and it kept me interested and I plan to buy the next in the series.  That said, I admit that I haven't read widely in this genre, which we used to call Sword and Sorcery back in the sixties but which I haven't followed since then.  Until.. I was drawn back in by Game of Thrones, and I became a George RR Martin fan.  So, although this novel was recommended as one to be read by Martin fans, unfortunately I compare it to the master.  And Abercrombie is not Martin; he lacks the texturing, the complexity, the vivid and morally challenged characters (especially the strong women), and the impending sense of doom.  I just don't get the feeling that \\"winter is coming,\\" although there are many hints that great conflict is just around the corner.  So I was torn between a three star (compared to Martin) or a four star (for a fun time with The Blade Itself), and I settled on a four star which I think is fairer.  Abercrombie is good enough on his own not to need the comparison.
B004T5R2HQ|3.0|Was very happy worth this app until its stopped opening. I have the G2x. From what it sounds like I am not the only one having issues. Hope this can be fixed or I wet will have to install. :(
B004Y1USV2|4.0|All I knew about this album prior to its release was that it was with Benoit David on lead vocals verses John Anderson. I've seen the current version live a few times and I had no problems with this line up at all. Ok, I do miss some of John's added percussions, wind chimes etc... I got over it quickly. The internal relationships between the band members or lack thereof are none of my business.       The first thing I did after receiving the CD was to simply listen to it, didn't read the liner notes or anything. I just wanted to explore new music from one of my favorite bands of all time. All I kept thinking when listening to it for the first and second time was Drama and I didn't know why. Well, I finally had some time to grab the case and read a bit. Wow, I had to give myself a pat on the back for paying attention to what I was listening too. Who'd thought that Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes would be enlisted for this venture?       I don't know what happened to Oliver Wakeman but that's ok, I thought his skills were adequate but his stage presence lacked passion. In the spirit of classic progressive music, this CD took a few listening's to really appreciate it for what it is verses what I might have been expecting or past albums. I think that this CD has captured some of the vintage sound of the band members prior to 90125. Sure, it lacks some of the richness of sound that I guess Anderson delivered with the afore mentioned added instruments but it sounds like a Yes album to me. Another thing lacking is Anderson's lyrics which are spiritually influenced.  To me, this is refreshing since I'm not looking for gospel inspiration but music to enjoy.       I have no idea how successful this release is but I personally hope that it does well enough to inspire a future release. I think these guys still have something left to offer both onstage and in the studio.
0553386794|5.0|I'll admit, I'm still a novice when it comes to the fantasy genre, but this one has me hooked. Without giving out any spoilers, the story never takes the turns you think it will. When you think that you see something coming, it usually means that the story will make a 180. I highly recommend and I am staying optimistic about the following books. I was introduced to this series by the HBO television show, and it's nice to see how they stayed true to the story. I would suggest reading the first book when watching season 1 of a game of thrones.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|The most recent update is broken on my Nexus S. When I select a text field the keyboard comes up, then after I type a single letter it goes away.

B004LWZVZM|5.0|This movie is based upon \\"The Assassin's Accomplice: Mary Surratt and the Plot to Kill Abraham Lincoln\\" by Kate Clifford Larson. I've read this book and reviewed it here and had some issues with it, but generally I felt it managed to stay true to the story of what is normally referred to as the Lincoln Conspirators. Let me explain. While John Wilkes Booth is considered Lincoln's assasin, a group of men and one woman (Mrs. Mary Surratt) were implicated with helping Booth to execute Lincoln's murder. Booth was shot and killed at Garrett's barn in Virginia about 2 weeks or so after escaping the Capital and temporarily avoiding capture. As the government investigated the plot to kill Lincoln, several names came up of people who were complicite in achieving to kill Lincoln and effectively attempting to bring down the government. In some cases, it was easy to connect conspirators to specific acts. In the case of Mrs. Surratt, who claimed she had no knowledge of any plans, it was not that clearcut.<br />For dramatic purposes, this film deals with the attempts of a young lawyer name Frederick Aitken who agrees to defend Mrs. Surratt. Surratt, while proclaiming innocence, does little to help in her own defense.<br />I thought this movie was really quite good. I know it got a bad rap when it came out because it was described as 'too long' and 'slow moving', but I thought it did a wonderful job of tackling a complex story and reducing the issues involved to their basic state. I'm also a big fan of the Civil War so I was a natural audience for this movie.<br />Aside from a compelling script, the cast was top notch and worked well off of one another. The film was beautifully photographed and conveyed the appearance of ca. 1865 Washington. In the end, it was up to the viewer to decide if Mrs. Surratt was guilty or innocent.
1407109375|5.0|This is the last book in a trilogy.  The author has managed to maintain the personalities of the characters throughout the entire series.  You feel what happens to them deep down inside you as you experience the hardships in their lives.  Very suspensful to the end.
B0038AUY96|1.0|Some reviews suggested that it was as good or better than 'the millennium' trilogy which i thought was fabulous, so i picked it up<br />Though it started like a stephen king novel, it showed some potential in the first few chapters, and then the first few chapters never ended,<br />they repeated themselves until a fourth of the book was done.<br /><br />I considered dropping the book several times, but out of habit, finished it anyway. I;m sure there are better books out there.<br /><br />Very boring indeed. Not even close to a Steig Larsson book!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This product is very awesome, I'm a huge competition gamer, go to all the big conventions, E3, Quake Con you name it, and I love that I can take this with me and leave it in my  Hotel room, very nice screen revolution, but with the Xbox in the case this gets very heavy very fast while carrying it, but I have a Xbox laptop that I had made a couple years ago, and I wanted to see witch I like better, and it is a quarter toss, both really good, but this is much cheaper than a $2,000.00 dollar Xbox laptop, so if you don't have money to burn buy this much cheaper.
B005KAH7QU|2.0|The first 15 to 20 minutes is beautiful and kudos to the crew but it's a slide from there. Just to say it, they should have hired a Chinese martial artist advisor. Some of it is well choreographed and edited but that too slides as the film proceeds. The 'super' presumably CIA agent, and the evil henchmen who either Hanna or Eric should have dispatched with one hand suddenly become their equal when necessary to the declining plot. In reality they are simply the psychopathic three stooges. The 'identity crisis' Hanna has because, having mastered the internet and come to fully understand molecular genetics in about 5 minutes, she understands that she is 'different' which leads directly to another plot failure. I really wanted to like this film from the trailer. It looked original and exciting and, at the beginning it was exactly that. Banality crept in like an ever deflating balloon. I think the writer really had no understanding of his main character and the director was simply clumsy in his transitioning Hanna from the pristine life of a subarctic dweller entering 'civilization' for the first time and dealing with all that entails to the precious little spoiled Eurogirl that she seems to become. Sorry to be clumsy myself here expressing my disappointment, this being the first time I have chosen to ever comment on a movie but that disappointment is what drove me here. Bana was good but winds up doing absolutely stupid things. Ronan is good but ditto. Both of their characters go from being highly competent to bumblers to serve the writer's lack of imagination. I think you will be very happy up to about the sewer cover in the middle of a desert...sorry, guys. I REALLY wanted to like this movie. But, as the first reviewer above said, this movie required a 'childlike passion' but with full emphasis on 'child'. Even with the value of the USD being systematically destroyed, four bucks was too much.
B004BCT2HU|1.0|Poor choice and just 50 minutes of content on DVD. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed with the offer on DVD even though I am fan of David Garrett
B001E45XT4|5.0|Good headphones. Comfortable, good sound quality, solid in build.  A good deal at the current price of $25 (Aug 2011).  My only heads-up, fellow-Amazoners, is that while they're fine for computer/laptop use, they won't work on the Playstation 3.    [From Plantronic's support website: \\"Re: Plantronics GameCom 367.  Unfortunately that headset does not show compatible with the PS3.\\"]      It appears Plantronic's Gamecom 777 will work with the Playstation (suggested in Plantronic website comments) and I also read on the web that an rca-to-usb audio adaptor might make it work, but I had no luck when I tried using an old Griffin Imic.    So a good headset, and worth considering if you're after computer-headphones.  But if your 13 year old son is trying to talk you into buying this to use on the family Playstation3 (my situation) tell him they won't work, and look elsewhere.

030746363X|1.0|I have tried just about everything in this book.  Most of the things in this book did not do anything.  The other things did the opposite of what they were supposed to do.  There was one useful thing in this book.     I tried eating breakfast(usually I skip it), that also made me put on a few more pounds.     I gained 10 lbs of fat on the slow carb diet.  If you are fat, it is probably a decent diet.  I had a few pounds to loose before and had a few more to loose after.      There are some inaccuracies in the diet.  Tim Ferris says the lactose in cheese makes you fat, except for cottage cheese because it has minimal lactose.  If you actually spend any time reading a nutritional label you can see that cottage cheese has more lactose than just about any other cheese.       Kettle bell swings did nothing for me.  Except I wasted money buying some weights.     The supplements did nothing for me.      I have been able since moving on from the advice in this book to achieve most of my goals.  This book was entertaining but very fluffy.       Some of the Ecosgue stuff was mildly effective.  These exercises helped my sore back some.  My back feels great these days due other reasons though(heavy deadlifts, low inflamation diet).
1416972250|2.0|I am so disappointed with City of Glass. I was hoping the alternating<br />POV would stop, but it didn't. There was text that just so long-winded<br />that I found myself skipping over it. Not to mention the needless<br />death and everything else that was just /needless/.<br /><br />How could the third book go downhill so quickly? The second book<br />\\"Ashes\\" was really good and \\"Glass\\" started off good, but it just<br />/stopped/. I can't pinpoint where it lost its luster, the only thing<br />that matters is that it did.<br /><br />**Spoilers**<br /><br />I never do spoilers, but this book deserves it.<br /><br />1) The alternating POV. I like reading from Clary's perspective and<br />only Clary's perspective. Ashes did this as well, but not as bad.<br />I read POV's from Simon, Jace, and even Isabelle. It wouldn't have<br />been so bad if the POV was switched when something unimportant was<br />going on or maybe a POV switch for every chapter, but /no/. There'd be a<br />few paragraphs from Clary's POV and then a paragraph from Jace's POV<br />and then switched back to Clary's and then back again all during stuff<br />that was very important. Seriously, I don't care how Jace thought the<br />valley looked or how he lost his piece of thread.<br /><br />2) When they, Luke and Clary, get to the City of Glass a lot of long<br />text starts to appear. I don't know how many times I skipped over text<br />that was so boring I thought about stopping. There's also a lot of<br />repeat sentences. Throughout the book some things were mentioned up<br />to three times. It made me want to pull out my hair because it had<br />already been discussed or said.<br /><br />3) Sebastian, Sebastian, Sebastian, or should I say Johnathon?

The next thing you know he becomes a superstar on wall street, makes a lot of money, gets some fame. But of cousre their is trouble ahead, their are some side effects to the drug,and Eddie must deal with with mobsters and others that want the pills.

0756404738|3.0|My review is somewhat in the same vein as James M. Bennett \\"Stallion Cornell\\" -- this is a page-turner.  Rothfuss tells a very interesting story, and I will definitely pick up and read Vol. 3 as soon as it comes out...but only to see how things turn out.      My problem is that although Rothfuss tells a good story, his writing could really use work.  As I said in my review of \\"Name of the Wind,\\" one of the biggest problems with the story is the protagonist (Kvothe) himself.  In his (Kvothe's) own words:  \\"My name is Kvothe. I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.\\"    ...yet, after reading Wise Man's Fear, I constantly find myself wondering how Kvothe made it to his 18th birthday alive, much less rescued princesses, talked to gods, and the like.  You know how, when you watch a horror movie, the protagonists are continually doing stupid things that any audience member with two brain cells can tell will be disastrous?  (Ex: checking to see if the dead possessed killer is really dead, opening the door that's clearly the Evil Door to Hell, running blindly into the haunted forest without a flashlight, etc., etc.).  Essentially, the main plot element of \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" is our supposed hyper-precocious genius of a hero continually performing supremely idiotic acts, getting himself into trouble, and then having to get himself out again.    Example: At one point, Kvothe has been accepted for training with a secretive group of (essentially) kung fu masters.  He is accepted (in part) because he shows unusual insight and intelligence into their way of life.  After about two months of training, he is progressing, yeta 10-year old girl still beats him regularly.  Why?  Because she has been training for *years,* as opposed to just two months.  Now, at this point, any reasonably intelligent person would think, \\"Gee-I've been training for two months, but she's been training for years-I'll have to train much longer before I become as good as her.\\"  Not Kvothe, though.  Our hero, whose mature insight supposedly gained him entrance to train in the first place, suddenly starts whining like a petulant child and complaining and yelling at his teacher because (in his opinion) she's hasn't moved him on to advanced training fast enough.     What?????  This guy is a hyper-intelligent prodigy, but fails to recognize:  (a) if you are a 17-year old boy who gets beat up regularly by a 10-year old girl, maybe your skills aren't as good as you think; and (b) whining and complaining angrily to your kung fu master isn't going to accomplish anything except getting your kung fu master angry at you.      The point:  Rothfuss continually has Kvothe doing and saying completely idiotic things to get himself into trouble, which he then gets out of through his immense cleverness.  It makes no sense-if the guy is clever enough to get himself out of half of these situations, then he definitely should have been clever enough not to get himself *into* the situations in the first place.  This is just one of the types of errors that makes this book maddening.  Time after time, I had to put it down because I was just so sick of groaning inwardly at Kvothe's unexplainable gaffes.     Another problem: While I realize that part of the whole point of Kvothe's story is that he has accomplished so many incredible feats, the time period is so compressed as to defy belief.  Take everything that happens in Harry Potter Books 1-4, and compress them into Book 1, and you have a sense of the pace.  There is no sense of a swelling plot/crisis-rather, the book is a series of about 10 not-very-interrelated adventures, each moreincredible than the next, all taking place within a matter of months.  In the space of two years, Kvothe goes from a starving orphan on the streets of a big city, to becoming (a) one of the greatest musicians in the land; (b) one of the greatest magicians in the land; (c) one of the greatest fighters in the land; and (d) a guest of the Fairy Queen, taught all of the arts of love and seduction.  I realize the guy is supposed to be some sort of prodigy, but at some point it begins to be ridiculous.    What really brought the point home to me is that when this book came out, I was in the middle of re-reading Gene Wolfe's \\"Urth of the New Sun\\" tetralogy.  Where Wolfe's writing is artful and subtle, Rothfuss's is clumsy and obvious.  Wolfe's tone is philosophical and deeply thought-provoking; Rothfuss' is matter-of-fact and prosaic.  I couldn't help thinking how much better \\"Kingkiller Chronicles\\" could have been if Rothfuss had simply thought up the story, then entrusted it to a much better writer to carry out.    Again, don't get me wrong: The story itself is interesting, and I plan to purchase and finish the series.  However, it's a lot like the old Flash Gordon/Little Orphan Annie serials in the 30s and 40s-they would use the simple device of a cliff-hanger ending to keep audiences tuned in for more next week.  The Kingkiller Chronicles is much the same-you keep reading because you want to see what happens next, not because Rothfuss' writing draws you in and keeps you there.

B002BCNK1Q|5.0|I watched this movie on television this weekend and was moved to tears.    Many people in this country (this world) beleive that bigotry and hatred are justified and justifiable. But never can a person be more deluded, unless people argue such bigotry and hatred as being a product of Godliness. Egads.    Bigotry never stems from hatred toward others for their differences, bigotry and hatred eminates from individuals sense of self-loathing and inadequacy.     Walt is an angry, hatred filled man whose attitudes helped shape and were further validated by, his dysfunctional dissonance toward life and living. Not being provided much context prior to his military service, one can only assume personality and behavior across the lifespan. However, Walt's military service alone is shown to be enough to cause great self-assuredness and egocentrism, while also creating the perpetuated myopic and callous racist and sexist views. The stern disciplinary behavior of a soldier is the fortitude and even arrogance presented by Walt, while the eternal burden of guilt of killing others create a complex, sympathetic character of an angry old man confronted by the meanings of life.    His relationship with his own children is strained. Who is to blame is left to presumption, however considering his children's shallow, biggoted (elderly are feable people to take from and diminish through patronization) and estrangement, it is obvious within the film that they are far less sympathetic than the targets of Walt's venom and vitriole.    Walt's strongest display of true confidence is when he locks away the vulnerable Thoa in his basement and avers that the greatest suffering that Thoa could ever experience would be that of killing another human being. Walt recognized that the enemey soldiers that he killed in battle were nothing more or less than he, frightened soldiers doing what they were ordered to do. They were human beings.     More so, Walt's bigotry is confronted head on when he steps into a social ill beleiving that he is only protecting his own self interests (his property from the disturbance of tussling neighbors and idiotic gang members.) From his single act of selfish heroism, Walt is subjected to all of the trappings of a vastly disparate culture, one which is based less in individuality and more in social structure, respect for culture and all of the cultures vulnerabilities.     With the help of a brazenly self-confident and enlightened young lady, Walt learns that life is not as it seems and that human beings (as opposed to cretins) are more complex and decent when viewed from various perspectives. What Walt previously interpreted as weakness and untrustworthiness, is in fact respectfulness and honor toward family. When that respect and honor is presented to Walt, he quickly recognizes some strengths within (such as good food) and opens his doors slightly to accept some of the fruits of the diverse culture. This is furthered by the opportunistic young lady who further educates Walt and (with the indentured help from the confused Thoa), shows that in truth, Walt \\"has more in common\\" with the odd characters that he has long loathed, than he has with his \\"own family.\\"    Thus, Walt not only begrudgingly changes his views, but his behaviors and ultimately sacrifices his own life in his one grand effort to make amends for all that has long tortured his soul... and to give life to someone else who is at the crossroads between good and evil (being pulled hardest from the dark side.)     Ultimately, Walt shows that love is for the world entire... and that we are all far more alike than we are different. If we all could open our eyes and our hearts, push aside our fears and angers... we just might be able to defeat the hatred and corruption and live in peace for one another, instead of for ourselves (our fears and angers.)     Thank you Clint Eastwood, for giving us GRAN TORINO. I wish I had put aside my own bigotry (toward your tough guy, vengeance seeking, immature machismo filled action films) and allowed myself to watch this movie long ago.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|These books are very long and descriptive, if that's not the sort of writing you prefer you should not buy these.  These books aren't the type to be finished over a weekend.

B0057UAE54|1.0|I have nothing negative to say about the music presented here.  This is one of the best rock live albums ever released.  However, my praise ends there.  Like everyone else alive, I bought the double album back in 1976. Awesome, I still have it.  Circa 1987, this was one of the first cd's I ever purchased.  I liked it so much that a couple of years ago I purchased the 25th Anniversary edition with all the bonus material that never made the first cut.  Awesome.  Now, what is this 35th Anniversary money-grab with 1 extra song.  A cover of Do You Feel Like I Do by Warren Haynes.   Yes, I want the WH version, BUT NO WAY WILL I PAY OVER $10 FOR ANY SONG.  Peter Frampton, I Don't Feel Like You Do.  I am not greedy.   And some artists wonder why people find \\"alternative means\\" to acquire their music.
B001UV4XFQ|4.0|The DVD was great, didn't skip or stutter like the one I had purchased at the store.  It was what I had wanted.  Even though it came in the time frame that was stated, it seemed to have taken longer than it should have to get here.
B003INBOEM|5.0|Anyone wanting some inspiration and insight into the essence of what it is to be a true martial artist look no further than this movie. Not only does it have great fighting scenes which aren't too over the top eg (crouching tiger, hidden dragon). It also has a great story line. This movie is certainly one worth being on the movie collectors shelf.     Being Blueray is also nice as it guarantees quality playback for the foreseeable future. I'm not sure how many extra features the special addition has but the added disk gives more info into behind the scenes aspects of the film, worth getting this version if you have an extra interest in martial arts/ Wing Tsun (Chun). If you think of this movie as another great ass kicking film to sit along side your other cult classics then the standard version will still satisfy.    Ip Man 1 is certainly the best out of the trilogy.

B004YXE438|5.0|While I think I have always enjoyed jigsaw puzzles, I would bet it has been 25 years since I have bothered to get one out.    I wasn't all that sure this game would suit me, I mean - puzzles? Really?  But after my first few puzzles I could only say \\"WOW!\\" was I wrong. I burned through the entire collection of 47 puzzles using huge puzzles (48 pieces) and hard difficulty within a couple weeks of free time. $It was the only game I played. It had me absolutely hooked!    There is also a ton of replayability built into this game, because you can use ANY image local on your phone to make your own new puzzles!

B0058ZPNOK|5.0|This is quite possibly the greatest indie-type film to-date. I know that's a bold statement and I obviously haven't seen every film (though I've seen a lot). I'll explain.    But first, a couple warnings: if you're just looking for a movie with a shallow plot and stunning visual effects, or you're just hoping to see more of Natalie Portman's skin, then I won't waste your time. (Although it does have an explosion or two and and some intense action/suspense scenes; see the trailer...)  Also, The language in the movie is really rough, so if that's a problem for you, be careful, I guess.    In spite of the language issue... I must say that the dialogue and story-writing are phenomenal, as is the acting. I'm quite certain that, literally, every single line in this movie is extremely valuable to the movie's development. Seriously--I think I could explain at least half of them with a good paragraph per scripted line.    I won't run through the whole plot for you, you can find that in the product description or other reviews. I just want to explain why I think this movie is so good.  My opinion is based on things such as character development, symbolism, metaphor, etc. And then of course things like dialogue and acting.  Here is a list of the major themes dealt with in  (and dealt with in a way that will quite likely have you in tears as the story hits you very close to home and with the power of a kick to the face):   - Facing your greatest fears/life in general instead of hiding from it (MAIN THEME, in my opinion)   - Being thankful for what you still have (especially, family)   - Dealing with the loss of a loved one (especially, a parent)   - Probably several important great ones, but I think these are the most important.    Just watch this movie with an open heart, it will move you and inspire you to look around you and realize what, or who, you have been taking for granted in your life. I watched it for the first time alone, but was so blown away that I had to share itwith my family. The second time through, I uncovered a lot that I had missed before and surprisingly my whole family found it just as moving. In fact neither me, nor my mother were even able to sleep that night! We apparently were both just laying in bed contemplating lines in the movie.    I don't mean to over-hype this movie, and I don't understand how it hasn't gotten the reviews that it deserves; but I truly hope, and I'm confident, that if you go into this movie with an openhearted attitude, it will inspire and change the way you see life as it did me and my family.

B004VMUS9G|1.0|Not good. Different than what's indicated on the pictures. Only has the digital time and timer. I was looking for the various utilities that came with it.
B004I2K4DY|3.0|As most others here have said, Nick Jonas is really lackluster in this production. (I read that his father had a lot to do with getting him on board this version - good connections will always make the world go `round). I would say that there's much to appreciate in the clarity of the image and sound, but the overall emotional impact is not quite as thrilling as the 10th Anniversary production. Besides Jonas being miscast, you have a very (supposed to be) `funny' Thenardier, as apparently Matt Lucas is some sort of `famous' British comedian, though I just didn't get his take on the part - completely the wrong guy. (Please compare Alun Armstrong's version in the 10th Anniversary to see what I mean.)    I was also excited to hear about the planned movie of the musical, wondering who would appear in the cast. You would hope after all the comments here, Cameron Mackintosh would hold his ground. If you've seen the wonderful `Stage By Stage' version that came out just 3 years after Les Miserables opened in London, you will see footage from what I am guessing was an earlier attempt to film the original British cast for a movie version. They obviously decided that this approach was not going to work (for whatever reason)...but I personally enjoy seeing it quite a bit, and I think it would have worked even better with a live audience, warts and all if that be the problem.    Anyway, disappointed as I was to see my favorite musical `downgraded' because of the 25th Anniversary performances of Marius and Thenardier, I am now wondering if, as with Nick Jonas, Cameron is just settling for less, just to get the darn movie financed and done. The Hollywood types are putting on the pressure for more popular names, with the announcement of Hugh Jackman starring as Jean Valjean.  I know he has a decent voice (much, much more so than the Jonas kid) and appeared in several London West End productions (you can hear him sing \\"Oh What A beautiful Mornin'\\" here [...]), but I'm uncertain about how he will handle the Valjean part. Given the way things are done in Hollywood, I am not too optimistic for the rest of the casting - look at the disasters of Madonna as Evita (but she financed it, so what could you say?) or Gerard Butler in `Phantom of the Opera' (a quote from Entertainment Weekly said, \\"Prior to his audition, Butler had no professional singing experience and had only taken four voice lessons before singing \\"The Music of the Night\\" for Lloyd Webber.\\"). There's a lot going on behind the scenes to get these big projects green lighted, and I'm not surprised...just hoping that Cameron could assert more control than apparently he is able.

1439165653|4.0|The Hundred-Foot Journey by Richard C. Morais is like a warm beignet on a cold morning, both satisfying and scrumptious, and leaving one wanting another bite.<br /><br />Hassan Haji and his family leave Bombay/Mumbai, India after the tragic death of Hassan's mother. The budding chef's journey is deftly told in not just geographic terms but in a rich layering of the smells and nuances of the prestigious French cooking world. The family ends up, via London, England, in Lumiere, France, buying a lovely old maison right across the street from Mme. Mallory's well respected country inn.<br /><br />Mme. Mallory's dismay at not reaching the pinnacles of culinary success that she had once hoped for reminded me of Louis XIV distraught chef Vatel. So much pressure for perfection of a craft is a somewhat alien concept for fast food America.<br /><br />Mme. Mallory takes Hassan under her wing and a Michelin-starred hungry chef is born. Hassan learns about the roots of the \\"ancien regime\\"through the complex history and meaning of food then went full circle as his true mantra of authentic food evolved into simple preparations and the freshest of food products.<br /><br />This book is destined to be made into a movie as it has some of the necessary ingredients (a tragedy, discrimination, flight from a homeland, sprinkling of romance, and a fable-like quality.)<br /><br />The characters are strongly portrayed and the plot engaging. There were parts, however, that begged for a soupçon more of spicing up. After Papa Haji, a truly colorful character is left behind in Lumiere, Hassan's personal life seems to turn into a shopping list of unexciting events. A little more detail and a few quirky characters might just have filled up the vacant spaces. He was in La Belle France, after all...<br /><br />Exceptional \\"cuisine\\" worth the captivating journey. Pass the powdered sugar, please.
B004LGPBZ8|5.0|I initially heard this album in the mp3 format & immediately thought that it should be listened to on vinyl for best results. Perhaps this is because the music reminded me of songs I had loved in the days before compact discs & digital media. There are plenty of reviews dealing with the music on this album so instead I will focus on the vinyl LP.<br />The songs are divided up over two records & come in a gatefold sleeve. The insert sleeves which contain the actual vinyl are sturdy cardboard & not merely paper & are covered with artwork.<br />The sound quality is outstanding. It is clear, upfront with lovely instrument separation. I have read negative reviews of Oasis albums stating that they are over compressed but this is not the case here.<br />All in all if you are considering buying this album on vinyl then I recommend that you go ahead & do so.
B004S3096K|5.0|There is no way I am going to write a synopsis or an in depth critical review of this book. It is too long and too complicated. I watched the TV series on HBO before I began reading the first volume. It did not disappoint, even though I knew where it was going. I don't generally read much fiction, having given up science fiction in my teens. And I cannot remember the last fantasy book I read; I just don't care much for a lot of magic and hocus pocus. Lord of the Rings, however, was fun and I enjoyed the movie, even though I have not read the whole LOTR. THIS book, however, is very different. There's magic in it, but quite a bit less. It's bloody, gory, sexually explicit--a story for adults, not kids. The author did a marvelous job creating all these distinct characters---most of them far from noble--and keeping them straight in a long novel with many twists and turns. And this is only the first book in a series of seven (5 of which have already been published). Highly recommended and the others are eagerly anticipated!
