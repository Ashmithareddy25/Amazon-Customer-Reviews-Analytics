B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a good dvd, and a very challenging, but worthwhile, workout. I would recommend this dvd to a friend.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|After too long a break, my favorite show is back. Major characters are going insane, secondary characters are coming to the forefront, and new characters are introduced in more depth. My only problem with the series is that they are too short.
1616550414|5.0|Got this for my husband for Valentines day.  He loves old video games and from the moment he opened the package he couldn't put the book down.
1449410243|5.0|Anyone with a cat will get the point, and fast! Yes, your cat IS plotting, though it may not be what you think. A very amusing book for people who love their cats anyway.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|first game that i dloaded on my new kindle<br />and i am \\"almost addicted\\" to it.<br /><br />thanks amazon for a fun game,and an awesome<br />tablet.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Great cyberpunk. It is dark, dangerous, and delightful to watch. This is a must see for all action, SciFi, and Cyberpunk fans. Good story and great action.
B000092T6M|3.0|This version of Robin Hood is still one of the best versions out today. It's well acted, well directed and engaging.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is awesome!!!I play it all the time on my new tablit!!!it is a great game for horse lovers!!!,
B007EECSFA|4.0|I enjoy everything I've read by Kate Morton. She does a great job taking you back to another time and writing in the style and flavor of some our my favorite books.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|This character is easy to empathize with. Loved the action but the acting really drew me in and made it a movie worth watching over and over again. Great job. I highly recommend it.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Not only does it show it differences and that we aren't that different from each other, it's just fun, entertaining and an easy watch. John Hughes was able to make the little differences people more understand and showed that we all have our struggles.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I found this app entertaining in the beginning, but as time went on I got extremely bored with it. If you like running nonstop like temple run then this is the game for you.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is the best book of all time!!!!! I love reading this book because Greg seems so real and its a really funny book. I think I may have laughed so loud that the neighbors could hear me!! : )<br />I highly recommend this book to read for break time, relax time, or just about any other time. I'm eleven and going into sixth grade and this book is for all ages boys and girls. Now I'm not much of a reader but when there's a diary of a wimpy kid book ask anyone I'll read it. I know it costs $$ but it's all worth it!<br />P.s. you should read every book. Each one is funnier than the last!!! :  )
B001HPP2X2|1.0|I bought this for my wife - she likes it ... I think the show it utter stupidity!  Why they make movies, shows like this is beyond me.  No wonder our society if so messed up.  Dexter, The walking Dead all need to be banned!  It provides ideas for people to do crazy unthinkable things.
B009IA9OLE|5.0|Can't put this game down. I showed it to a few people at work and they tried it on my kindle. They bought it too for themselves- it's just a great game.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Love the James bond series. The film soundtracks are<br />among my favorites. Unforgettable songs by great artists.<br />I have the original album from the early 80's and wanted<br />the CD's.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I chose this books because Nicholas Spark has always had great books in the past.  This lived up to my expectations.  It held my interest throughout and I hated to see it end.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I don't see the draw in this game- I played up until like level 4 and then it got so hard I had to put it away. Glad it was free cause if I paid for it I would have been mad.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Bought for my 7 year old grand daughter and she loved it.  She has watched it several times already and enjoyed it each time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Terrific app. The only way it could be better is to show me what/if I did wrong when I lose.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book. The chemistry between the characters is just as it should be. I'm definitely looking forward to the next book in this series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a fantastic sequel to the book, The Hunger Games. It is so compelling with the capitol's twisted ways of playing with the district lives. So warming with story of young, complicated love. So utterly dangerous with the survival of life that seems to be so far beyond reach. I considered this to people wanting adventure, suspense, and romance in such a way that the world around you disappears.

B003QSPO9K|4.0|True to life special effects, Great story line. Great Acting. I watched this movie on my Kindle fire that I have had for about 8 months while flying back from Hawaii after visiting the WWII memorial.
B007CDGAQQ|5.0|Got here WAY ahead of time it got shipped promptly they're great I would defintely recomend them to you also.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I've been hoping for some time now that Amazon would offer this as the FAOTD. I am not disappointed in the least!<br /><br />Game play is easy to understand. Cube is easy to maneuver. No problems playing on my RAZR Maxx. It's fun to play. Colors and graphics are great. Hard to put down. No invasive permissions. No need for other Apps to play this. Game play type options. Score submission/Tweet options. What more could you want? This is a keeper for me!<br /><br />I'm really enjoying this App and if you enjoy matching games, I think you'll enjoy this App, too.
B00A0ABQLM|1.0|After battling this product, I don't feel it is worth the trouble to keep trying to install.  I had it working once after hours of effort, but then it went back into useless mode.  I can ping 8.8.8.8, but it won't connect with anything over port 80.  Looks to be a firewall problem, but that is just another indication of a crap driver.<br />You can get a better install from Startek, they use the ax88179 also.  Don't expect it to change anything though. Even if you get it to work, next patch day it stops working.<br />iAnker tech support is beneath uselss.  They actually sent me google search results and suggest I try a few of them.  Whoever Anker went to for tech supprot, they turned around and hired Haji Rachamadugu's kindergarden class.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I loved every part of this book everyone should read it man or woman any one that's American will love it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this series, i normally dont read fiction but im about to start book three. I definitely recommend this awesome love story.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|When Steig Larson died (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series), I started looking around for an author with a similar style and found Norwegian Jo Nesbo.  The protagonist of his novels, Detective Harry Hole, is an enjoyable character who \\"takes a licking and keeps on ticking.\\"  Detective Hole is a recovering (though not always) alcoholic policeman who ends up getting pretty beat up in each adventure but always manages to somehow succeed in solving the crime.  As with all the novels, the setting is Oslo, Norway.  \\"The Phantom\\" involves Harry's effort to locate and confront a phantom-like drug kingpin and has many twists and turns along the way until the final surprise ending.  The ending isn't really an ending as it leaves you looking forward to the next Harry Hole episode.  Throughout the Harry Hole novels, Harry has an on-going, on-again, off-again romantic relationship with a beautiful woman named Rakel.  It continues in this novel and the book ends with you wanting to find out what happens next with this up and down, often-frustrating relationship.  If you like crime novels that keep you turning the pages with an interesting romantic element, I'd match Jo Nesbo up against anyone.  Highly recommended, especially if you like to follow ongoing characters in each new novel.
B008FYZIVY|1.0|3 of the disks didn't work.  They froze up.  skipped.  Poorly made product.  I gave this as a gift so it was really a disappointment.
B008GVSOCQ|4.0|The same thing I'm a sucker for romance movies . Excuse my language Jane Austen movies all of the ones I have see anyways I can watch them over and over again
B008602KQI|5.0|I SAW MOVIE FRIST,THEN READ BOOKS,AND IN THIS CASE , I FOUND THE MOVIE TO TRACK WELL WITH BOOK.

CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT MOVIES.  65 AND ENJOY A GOOD READ, WHICH I FIND SUZANNE COLLINS BOOKS TO BE.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Bought this for my son's Kindle Fire and it fits well and does the job.  Also once outfitted with this case, you can slide the whole thing into the Timbuk2 Kindle Fire Plush Sleeve with Memory Foam (also sold on Amazon) for great travel protection!

B009UX2YAC|3.0|a wonderfully fun filled game although I would say temple run is more funner for a 10 yr old r me. it is a pretty much copy of tempile run. but still a great game! :)
B004R13U6Y|4.0|Nice interface, The app is a little slow when page-turning some of my files.  This may be related to file size, I don't know yet.<br /><br />Having thumbnails of the cover of the PDF is nice, but you have open the file at least once before ezPDF starts displaying the thumbnail.<br /><br />It's not great at organizing files, but at least ezPDF lets you keep PDFs in folders/subfolders and still access them.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really enjoy playing this on my Kindel, I would recomend this and any of the other Game on the kindel

1423136802|4.0|These are great books, and I would recommend them to kids and adults.<br /><br />The only problem I have is the printing of these books seems to be pretty off. I am on the 4th book, 'Battle of the Labyrinth' right now, and there are more than a few ink stains (not actually sure what they are but I think it might be ink stains) in the book almost as if it was printed very badly. There are also some slight blue stains on a lot of the pages. Also on some pages at the top I can tell that the pages didn't go through correctly because they have lots of little black dots on them almost making it look the page was dragged through something...<br /><br />The only other complaint I have about the printing is that in the previous three books, every few pages or so there would be a page where a few words were almost unrecognizable because they didn't print correctly (very faded and a lot of the time many letters missing).<br /><br />Overall this does not make me regret my purchase but I am disappointed that the printing of these books (especially the 4th one!) is so bad. I feel like now I need to flip through books I order to see if they have this problem so that I can exchange them.
B005MSD6QU|5.0|This show is awesome I used to watch it every Wednesday before I started working 2nd shift. So glad I can catch up on it
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This kid is great. For a guy in his 20's he has a knack for righting hooks and grooves that seem to melt the ladies. He does Rock, Soul, R&B, Reggae, and Rap very well. Reminds me a lot of Prince.<br /><br />Both albums are no brainers, so just buy them, fire up the hot tub, poor a glass of wine, and get in the mood. Take note that the material is rated R so may want to be careful blasting it around easily offended people.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I've been using this app for a while because it is probably the best office suite app on Android.  I was really excited when I found out that OfficeSuite Pro 7 was released a couple of days ago because it was supposed to have a much nicer UI.  A couple of days pass, and this app still has not been updated to the new version!  What gives Amazon?<br />I would highly recommend getting OfficeSuite Pro 7 off of the Google Play store, which Amazon is very poorly competing against.<br /><br />Edit: Dropped to 1 star from 3 stars because it's been several weeks and this still has not been updated to OfficeSuite Pro 7!  DO NOT BUY THIS ON THE AMAZON STORE; GET IT ON GOOGLE PLAY INSTEAD.
B008VJYWMY|4.0|My wife and I have enjoyed Il Divo since the very first CD was released.  Great harmonizing, of course.  I just wish the price on the box set was more affordable.  This is the only affordable thing from the box set, and it's worth it!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the app,but wish it would flip on the kindle fire.  It always is upside down<br />I like every thing else
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Some songs are very good, but the majority are fantastic. The kid has a smooth, creamy voice that oozes sexuality. This album received many Grammy nominations, deservedly so. Guys, put this in your rotation and bust it out when you want to melt your girl.
0226264211|5.0|First read this book in a political science undergrad course 10 years ago, and recently read it again.  If you're a liberal, you need to read it to intelligently understand the American socio-economic foundation and be able to argue with conservatives about why some policies advocated are pointless and ill-founded, while learning why other ideas have merit and why capitalism has and can work better.  If you're a conservative, you need to read it to intelligently understand why you should turn off Fox News, begin to think critically about the conservative platform and revitalize the Republican party by reintroducing some consistency in its policies.  In short, being an informed citizen requires careful consideration of this book.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|...the people who already paid are satisfied. The reviews for paying Kindle users are disappointing. I was all set to purchase until I read reviews for paid app. Apparently way too many issues to buy for kindle fire hd...  If I'm buying I want unlimited bombs, lots more free ink choices, many more words, etc etc... not JUST no ads... Paying to only have no ads isn't enough... Looking forward to buying this one day soon! I love playing this and will have to be satisfied with free version until this gets updated on paid version...  :(
1582701903|4.0|I purchased this for my Dear friend in California, she said its a good read, and is happy with her gift, so I have not actually read or seen it..
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Few movies garner a second look these days, but the Marvel brand changed that with Iron Man, Thor, and now The Avengers. Yes, I excluded Hulk and Captain America because neither movie intrigued or moved me. I did find The Avengers entertaining and worth a second or third look.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|Too difficult to follow the story, too many characters, changes in scenery, i couldn't finish the book, especially since it's just a first book in the series, i gave up.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Five star because it's John Corey, a character who is head and shoulders above the pack ( meaning other writer's action characters). This was a well rounded narrative with a very good plot that stayed focused throughout the 600+ pages. You had to have some memory retention to keep up with some of the characters who were woven into the plot, as they impacted certain parts of the story at an earlier stage and reappeared later. A DeMille book that ensures his first class stature amongst his peers and long may it continue.

B0007MWZEK|5.0|This is my third one.  I bought one, liked it, so bought another for the other floor.  One of the batteries appeared to be dying, so I bought a new battery ($17) a few months ago.  It was rotten... would go for half speed for about five min.  Remember, I've used these for five years, at least, so know how it should sound.  Rather than buying another battery, I bought the whole unit, and SURPRISE!  It's working well!  I put the new battery in one of the old machines, and it is working at half speed.  My machine is clean, but evidently it is just old, and even a new battery isn't doing it.  I charged the \\"bad\\" new battery, and put it in the new one, and guess what?  The \\"bad\\" battery is ok.  Now, I will have to use them up to see if my old charger is also worn out, but I am a happy camper... now have two batteries that are working, and will have to retire my old sweeper.. just worn out, I guess.  I do love these things though... quick pick-up.

It really is nice to download an alarm clock and actually just get a really nice alarm clock!  The advanced settings let's you decrease the time between snoozes so after you lazy butt hits the snooze a few times it will become impatient with you.  Nice feature.
0545265355|5.0|Fun, fast-paced, and exciting. The storyline is appropriate for young adults and adults alike. The themes and topics addressed here are worth considering if you are the 16-year old protagonist, or a much older observer. Totalitarian governments and their excesses make for good stories about the resilience of the common people and their struggle to survive.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|George R. R. Martin is a literary crackerjack. His episodic, massively detailed,  completely fleshed-out, throughly chronicled world of Westeros complete with a multitude of characters is an undeniable page turner. Starting in the cold hard packed lands of the north filled with honor bound men and many a thing that goes bump in the night, the reader is led south to the seat of power in the Red Keep-- the iron throne. On this journey, you meet both pawns and kings and realize quickly that every act in public and promise in secret is building towards a power coup that could end the realm. Trouble descends from every direction. Intrigue is plotted in every shadow. And no one-- I mean no one-- is safe. Who will win the match and live to see another day? Because in the game of thrones you either win, or you die.<br /><br />This book just does it for me on so many levels. Martin's style is fully detailed but not overly flowery. I appreciate the succinct way he describes the people, the places, and the power struggles. It allows you to get engrossed in your imagination without getting swamped in the mountains of words on the pages. That is not to say that this is a brief read. This book is long, but I think even the faint of heart will look up several hours later and realize they have read 200 pages. Don't let the thickness of the book dissuade you from the fabulous story inside.<br /><br />Characters are the mortar that binds this book together. Martin's story is chocked full of some amazing people. Some of my personal favorites are:<br />*Jon Snow the bastard(Martin's words not mine) son of an otherwise honorable man who leaves his family in search of adventure beyond Winterfell.<br />*Arya Stark the rough and tough young lady of the north using a sharp tongue and shaper sword to get into all kinds of trouble and scrapes both at home and in the capital.<br />*Tyrion Lannister the ill-begotten dwarf son of the richest of men who uses his brain in the absence of brawn.<br /><br />Martin is also talented at writing characters you hate. Some that I loathe are:<br />*Prince Joffery Baratheon the cruel, painfully immature, and frighteningly merciless young king to be.<br />*Ser Ilyn Payne the mutilated and muted knight bent on delivering the king's justice... with his axe.<br />*Queen Cersei Baratheon the cunning, manipulative, and grasping woman beside the king who'll stop at nothing and step over anyone to stay on top.<br />And this is really only the briefest of lists. So many characters to love and loathe and then loathe and love in turns. Get reading!<br /><br />The book is so good that I need to give you a disclaimer. DO NOT watch the HBO series first if you can help it. Season One of GOT did such an amazing job recreating Martin's book that it steals a bit of the glory from the novel if viewed before the book. Many of the conversations and small details are EXACTLY like the book.<br /><br />But some things just can't be transferred to the silver screen. The book has a few third person perspectives that really add to the feel of the tangled tale not to mention the overall story that I believe Martin is trying to tell. Knowing some things before hand can cause the book to feel like a doomed march to destruction, an illusion that Martin meticulously suspends-- until the silent sword is already swung catching the reader unawares and doubtless unprepared on several occasions. Besides, the series will rob you of the opportunity of imagining some of the characters-- personally, my favorite part of reading books like this.<br /><br />Overall this book is a 5 Commendable Yarn. I say 5 because I stayed up until 2am on several nights reading, the consequences of a tired day with twins to come be hanged. That and I am telling absolute strangers to read this book. I am hooked. I am trying to pace myself so that I don't finish the books too soon before the next one comes out, but I started Clash of Kings yesterday and am halfway through.../><br />Martin is also talented at writing characters you hate.

B000ZM7VVO|3.0|It's a good album and you can tell Flogging Molly had fun as they were recording this album. It has the feel of sitting in a pub listening to a band, it's that intimate. Unfortunately, unless you are hardcore fan of this genre, it will be pleasant for a day, maybe two, then wear out it's welcome and only be revisited if you are in the right mood or if the situation warrants.

B006JTS5OO|5.0|I have always loved The Muppets and this movie had me smiling from start to finish. Lots of fun for all ages.
B004U52VPS|3.0|Got this for my niece. it's an okay game but quickly loses its luster with the repetitive set up. Expansion packs add more pieces, birds, pigs, and patterns but it also adds more hassle with set up. Likewise, my niece was entertained only briefly, clearly preferring the immediacy of the video game.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is really cool.  I play it every chance I get.  I don't like having to share my Kindle Fire with my little brother.  I would like to have my own.  This game is very colorful and has a lot of pigs that you have to damage.  There are alot of Angry Birds that do different things.  Totally awesome!  I recommend this to everyone.
1616550414|5.0|I'll be back soon with more words, but is just perfect, everyone at my office want a piece of it
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I'm brain injured so I'm always looking for ways to better my thinking ability. This does that in a colorful fun way!
B004EI3ON4|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I am a big Tron fan and I enjoyed Tron Legacy but its strongest point was definitely the music and it is all captured here. The track &#34;The Grid&#34; is iconic as much for its originality as it is for its liberal use throughout the film. This album is definitely worth it and I am strongly considering ordering a hard copy of the album so I can add it to my collection.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a fun & addictive app. It is easy & relaxing to use or you can compete against the time clock.
B005H29GSI|3.0|Review number 97. For 2 to 4 players. Fairly entertaining / fun game for kids [maybe] from 4 to 12 years of age - even for some adults who possess some patience (as well as some imagination). Good asking price. Game comes with two angry birds, three pigs, two ice blocks + more. Good to maybe kill the better part of an hour with, that is - when you care to take a break from depending on your various electronic devices. I, personally wasn't aware of of it until very recent, but it looks like Mattel has several other Angry Birds games out. After reading a couple of customer reviews, I thought that possibly the Angry Birds: Birds In Space Game and the Angry Birds - Exclusive Board Game Mega-Smash looked promising.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|They could make it a little better put its really fun to play when I board or something u should try it
B0043URV5U|3.0|Classic songs from Bob Seger. If you are a fan of his work then you will enjoy this compilation. Bought it for my ex-girlfriend for her birthday and she loved it.
B0086HGW42|3.0|This is an ok cd. He's tatlented, but the music is not all that exciting in my opinion. Definitely sample first.
B000056JYB|5.0|Review no. 204. A much-welcomed 2-CD expanded reissue of the late '60's British supergroup Blind Faith's sole album. Here, we get the lp's initial six tracks + nine bonus / unreleased cuts from the band's vault. Disc one, of course - the record's half-dozen BF compositions with a couple of (definitely) must-hear left-overs like an extra edit of \\"Can't Find My Way Home (Electric Version)\\" and the somewhat familiar \\"Sleeping In The Ground\\" - two edits in fact. Also, I for one sort of liked the fifteen-minute \\"Acoustic Jam\\". I had completely forgotten about \\"Well All Right\\" with Steve Winwood's stunning keyboard work - as this gem truly showcases the four gifted musician's pure brilliance as a band. Been awhile since I've heard this lp in it's entirety. Disc two features four 'lengthy' jams. All are well-produced and well-played, but I believe that I favor the awesome twelve-minute \\"Change Of Address Jam\\" the best. Wanted to mention also that the sixteen-minute \\"Slow Jam #2\\" manages to somewhat stand out. Comes with an irreplaceable 22-page CD booklet packed with band info. Highly recommended.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked the description and it made you keep guessing. Liked in the epilogue how they told you about their future together.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|Excellent movie and I prefer this original version to the American remake. The set pieces definitely convey the time period the movie takes place in and there is a great balance between darkness and light that doesn't get in the way such as when movies are so dark that you can't see anything and feel as if you wasted time and money. The casting is spot on and the mix between romance, mystery, and horror is just right. I personally do not mind subtitles but if that feature isn't for you then look into getting the American remake.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|these guys are so talented! I can't stop listening to this. They deserve all the acclaim they've gotten! Great buy!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|haven't finished the book yet, but I am really enjoying it. some really good quotes/writing, can't wait to find out the end of the story.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This is a great game online but the free version is not. After like fifteen minutes of play it goes to an add and you can never get passed it
B001HN69AY|3.0|This is a mediocre movie made memorable by being Heath Ledgers last piece of work. If it weren't for that then I doubt I'd have bought it. Tom Waits and Christopher Plummer are both excellent in this movie and the imagery is award winning but the story is too disjointed to be worthwhile.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Played on computer for yrs, but love playing on kindle.  The touch screen make game more fun.  Play everyday, figure it is good for the mind.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|HOURS of time wasted on this! Unique, challenging game play. Never had a problem with functionality. Here's a sample conversation in my house: &quot;you've had it all day. I want to try&quot; &quot;but I'm almost done with this level.&quot; &quot;it's my turn!&quot; I want MORE.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Very good voice acting and a cute story line.  Nothing new or innovative but a good story about relationships.  Really good animation and really good British actors to provide awesome vocals and acting.
B005BW0TO4|2.0|I like 3 Doors Down but in retrospect I could have done without this purchase. Unless you are a hardcore fan you can listen to their songs on youtube and save yourself some money.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Even if your not into apocalypse movies or shows, this will still entice you.  Very real human stories, just in a post-apocalyptic setting. The production quality is amazing including directing and especially the acting.  No movie or show has given me the emotional roller coaster ride that Walking Dead has.<br /><br />Best Show Ever
B004SDSSFY|4.0|I haven't tried to do anything too complicated with this; I keep a running shopping list, and notes for my time at work. Never had a problem. Finds and opens other docs I have somewhere in the phone-brain.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Heard the title from a award show and tried it.  I love the complex, troubled characters.  Can't have enough episodes!
B0038BBA4I|2.0|I purchased this after being caught up in the hype of Mumford and Sons big time debut on the music channels and I regret purchasing this. It has some decent songs but in the end you can listen to them on youtube without having to waste money on it unless you are actually a fan.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|By far the best telling of the Roman civil wars.  HBO knows how to do it.  Set, costume, directing, acting, everything: All top notch. My only problem: only 2 seasons.  If only their was more viewership they could have ran with the series and followed all the drama of the Roman Emperors which I think would make amazing television.<br /><br />If you enjoy anything that is Rome, this is a must see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game but we could go with out so many advertisements. But I play this game everyday know matter what.
B007REV4YI|2.0|I love Daniel Craig as James Bond, but this movie was lacking in so many ways. Lacking a bad a** villian, lacking a good spy story, lacking a good plot. Sure there's action and the obligatory beautiful woman, but this movie was just lacking. It's as if they made this movie just to set up characters for future 007 movies. I'm not sure but I think Daniel Craig had a bored expression all during this movie too.
B001AACEP8|3.0|If you want to hear what put Katy Perry on the map then this is the debut album for you. Quite frankly, I think her early work is better than what has come after but in the end, given another chance, I don't think I would have bought this and instead just listened to her music on the I Heart Radio app or Pandora.
B008J34466|5.0|Great Album, it has really grown on me, and is in my jeeps player at all times! A must add to any Pink Fan for their collection!
B004TI5N38|5.0|I always enjoy David Baldacci's books and this is one of his best. I'll definitely purchase his next book also.
B00846F1YW|2.0|sorry but this game is really bad...misspelled words...to big to fit for android. you cant see the whole picture.. in a word pretty dumb.
B00138GXYU|2.0|If it was not on sale I probably would not have gotten this. A little bit of Britney Spears goes a long way and this is not one of her better albums.
1616550414|5.0|a must have for Zelda lovers! This book could be said like the encyclopedia of Zelda, but most importantly it shows the Zelda timeline
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the daily reading plans and the convenience of the Bible at my fingertips!<br />The option to choose any version of the Bible is wonderful.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|which is awesome! The take on modern socio-political issues in the context of the Zombie Apocalypse?  How clever!  It's a perspective/take on the theme that I have never even considered.  Read this book, then make all of your friends read it too.
B002436WFI|4.0|This is a great movie based on the works of Terry Pratchett and while funny and I imagine quite faithful to the books based on the length of the movies, it is that long runtime that works against it. Quite frankly, I got bored in a few parts. It does pick up in areas and the heart and humor (which is dry, witty, and subtle so if you don't like that kind of humor, move along) keep me coming back to it and Tim Curry plays an excellent villain, I'll watch this about once a year but more than that is overdoing it. Certainly don't regret the purchase even though the price point was a bit heftier. Still worth it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game and a real time killer without even knowing.  Very addictive! Once you choose to play it, it is hard to quit.  Fun to play.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Works exceptionally well.  i purchased a CD and the Cloud/Bitrate option to download Apocalyptica's &#34;Worlds Collide&#34; album.  Unlike most of you who might read this, I am not generally a consumer of music downloads.  As a first experience with this, it was great!
B0085P2Z6E|1.0|it was free and i thoght my 4 year old neicemight like it but even she after 3 min said this is dumb , you just find stuff and its to easy i watched her play and had to agree
B0047S1KMS|3.0|This was billed on IFC as a cross between a zombie horror movie and comedy like in the same tradition as Shaun of the Dead  and while there are funny moments this show ends up losing sight of that and going full on drama and horror. It's a good zombie show and the price is good for the entire run but don't be expecting too many laugh out loud moments.
B0049U4INC|5.0|Obligado para todos los que son emprendedores y buscan la mejor manera de &#34;encantar&#34; a sus clientes, compa&ntilde;eros y/o inversionistas.
B002JWD6AS|1.0|The story greatly lacked in everything. The whole musician thing just didn't make since. The characters were just not developed enough. The story was not developed. I kept waiting for it to end and the only reason I finished it: I bought it. Also the narration was HORRIBLE. A man narrated Sam but also Grace, then when it was Grace 's turn the woman narrated Sam's voice. Pass this up and try another book!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This is definitely a must see!  The music and humor is well worth the entertainment value. Even people who typically do not like musicals will enjoy this well acted humorous movie evolving around accapella competitions.
B005MIYI3K|4.0|This album from Nightwish is wonderful. They experiment with their style and direction without losing track of their own identity, a problem many other groups and artists face when they try something new. Anna is wonderful on lead vocals and seems more settled into her role than she was on the previous album.
0060594896|5.0|Jack's principles resonate deep within my soul.  As I read this, I couldn't help wishing I knew this information many years ago while in school.  Chapter 1 - taking 100% responsibility - is the key to get deeper into the other principles.  The principles build off of and compliment one another.  I love hearing Jack's personal stories about how he worked so hard to get Chicken Soup for the Soul published and DID NOT GIVE UP until his goal was realized.  This is an outstanding book by an outstanding man.  Inspirational, substantive, enlightening.<br /><br />David<br />[...]
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I chose the rating cause it was confusing but entertaining to me. It was a pretty good book to I guess.
B003LL3LHO|4.0|Ghosts of Ascalon had some wonderful characters and interesting plotlines. It was a good primer on the lore of Guild Wars 2, and I admit I cried at parts. I did, however, feel it dragged on a bit long, though it might have been my own expectations for what the book would be. I expected the central plot to be happening in Ascalon, whereas it's actually more about the journey - and facing more figurative Ghosts of Ascalon.<br /><br />Well written and engaging.
B005GVA2L0|4.0|The album starts off strong but dwindles as it goes on. Amy Lee proves she is back and she does not disappoint. Considering the price and if you are a fan of the Evanescence then this is a must have. Now, if you are worried because almost if not every member of the original group has left then look to We Are the Fallen to see how they are doing. They sound much like Evanescence did and I find them just as rewarding as Amy Lee.
1449410243|1.0|My 11 year old son bought this with his own money. He tore out the poster before realizing the content should have been rated for foul language and crude humor.  I'm not about censoring things but a warning of some sort would have been nice.
B007C2N3NK|4.0|I recently read The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe as a senior in high school, having not read it before. I found this book was a great fantasy and a book I could read with ease. I felt that C.S. Lewis came up with a very interesting plot that most readers can enjoy. I loved the setting descriptions, the characters, and overall plot. However, I feel this book suits a younger audience. The simple diction and context made the book seem of lower level reading, certainly not of my age group.<br /> There is a definite religious theme throughout the book that C.S. Lewis is trying to get across to his readers. He uses the Christian faith and Jesus Christ constantly throughout the book.  He uses the main characters to represent religious figures in the bible. Aslan represents Jesus Christ in which Aslan dies and rises from the dead. The White Witch symbolizes Satan with her evil ways and treatment of the animals and people. The children: Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy represent Jesus' disciples as the follow and love Aslan who represents Jesus Christ. Some might find this use of religion as an annoyance, but being a Christ follower, I actually liked these references and loved the connection that was portrayed between the characters in the book and the biblical figures of the bible.<br /> Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book, despite it being a little too young for my liking. The religious symbolism added extra substance to the book and made the reader think. This was a great book to read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I wish they would make three<br />because this game is awesome and I would want another one<br />it is awesome
0802798225|5.0|I decided to pick up this book because it sounded interesting from reading the back of the book. I started reading it right away and just couldn't put it down until I finished it. I love the relationship of the Fuentes brothers. I relate to them because I also have a crazy family. You will also fall in love with Alex and Brittany's relationship. You will be hook and all types of emotions will be provoked as you read this amazing book.
B005HGZVEM|5.0|AFter we saw  him live in concert we had to have one of his CDs.  This was the best. I
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I really like this application. I always go to this app and check how much battery life u have left.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I love the show, found out about comics after watching show first. Books are well written and just as good.
0446554995|1.0|A halfway decent book but I honestly thought it would never end. This book (and the others in these so-called trilogies) are so far removed from the excellent thrillers they used to write, it's difficult to believe Preston & Child wrote them. This will be the last one of their books I'll read; I only read this one to see if there would be an end to this tiresome storyline. Mr Preston should climb into one of these graves and Mr Child should climb into the other. If I wanted soap operas, I'd just watch one on TV.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Excellent minus a few glitches in it the game is very fun to play and  keeps Moe entertains Me always
0345537998|5.0|This is close to the best sci-fi I have read. The novel is a series of short stories combined, and it has that feel too which isn't great. The main character here is pretty wierd, almost like he has asperger's. The idea of the ship is wonderful though. This reminds me of another great sci-fi,The Foundation series by Asimov. Martin should finish the Foundation series it would be great.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I didn't think I would like a musical movie but this is<br />more than just a musical it actually had a plot and I enjoyed<br />it very much. I would even watch it again ... unusual for me !
B003G4W49C|5.0|I like the realism he puts in this book in the way the characters think. Also the way ender strategizes is great.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great!! I thought is was an amazing book. I'm so excited for the next Book from the author Jeff Kinney!!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|great cd, my husband like it and they went on to win a grammy.<br />Current music that even  that a 50 year old can appreciate
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Lee Child knows how to write a thriller.<br />Fast action, great detail, spot on detail. Does not get better than that.
0345802934|5.0|IQ84 is captivating adventure where the reader will experience the here and now and the other. The book has much material to reflect on and definitely will enjoy Murakami's distinctive descriptive writting. Once began, it is hard to put down,  Ilene
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very enjoyable game!! Realistic graphics; gives player a real sense of taking care of a horse. Takes a lot of memory though.
1419707671|5.0|My son loves these books.  They're funny relatable and they make children excited about reading.  My son is 8, so I like that there are words he doesn't know to give him a challenge.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Remastered, who could ask for more? A better sounding version of a great album, a Beatle fan all the way, I love it
B000JML7EC|5.0|Like you'd expect from a book from its generation, the dialogues and actions of the boy Jim are hard to picture a youth today doing. Unlike your expectations of the era, Long John Silver is hard to classify as fully good or fully bad, and character development happens at a fast pace more comfortable for modern readers. I'd definitely revisit it in a few years.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|These short stories are like small novels, which is what makes them and the author so great.  They are unique and far from predictable and they require a lot of thought by the reader.
B004SIP7QC|5.0|Picked this up on Amazon on Blu Ray for only $5. That's a great price for a classic, nice movie that will look great in any Blu Ray collection. It's ridiculous that this costs $5 and something like Hansel and Gretel is $28. Get this movie, you won't be sorry.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|Remastered, who could ask for more? The music is clearer and well I am a Beatle fan, had to have it.
0812993292|5.0|This is a well written wonderful story that is difficult to put down. Rachel Joyce has created a real gem with her first book.
B009PAETCG|1.0|Left my toddler alone on the tablet for 5 minutes and he managed to open this app and purchase \\"Kids Mode\\" for $10! No refunds on digital purchases - lesson learned. Beware \\"free\\" apps...
B000WGZGNS|5.0|If you like Beyonce just buy this DVD. She is really nice. The quality is good. My girlfriend just loved it.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Gregory Peck's performance is 5 stars! Amazing the plot of this film is somewhat still happening today in 'modern' times.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Exactly what I was hoping for! I love bones. I was waiting for it to go under $20! love love love
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this app. good graphics and don't have to spend real money to advance. it is also fun to breed and try to get cools dragons. I wish this quest came faster but very cool.
B004TI5N38|2.0|The plot line is more than thin and the character developement both shallow and uninteresting. It seems that the author has a fascination with the miliary and is trying to bolster some macho but nice guy image for his main character. It seems that he is targeting an audience that is enamored with all things military. It really is now worth spending money to buy this book.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|What can I say? A great Steinbeck novel in a movie, shows the desperation and struggle during the dust storms.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is an interesting one.....you start out as a basic infection and grow it to do what you want it to do; the entire time it is evolving or de-evolving the world moves along and tries to eradicate your new baby..... Needless to say it is an interesting and some what disturbing app :)
B000088E6D|5.0|I bought this CD because it was a better deal at $5 with the free mp3 version included. Michael Buble's Christmas album is $10 and does not have the free mp3 version yet. You can't go wrong buying a Michael Buble CD. I can't pick a favorite song because they're all so good.
0786888628|5.0|The book is an add to my book collection of books that are on my CMC Reading list.  Just like the others on the list it's important to a Marine and I know I will enjoy the read...  Thanks for your support...
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I loved the story line and the sound quality was perfect. The video quality was a little less than perfect due to the fact that it phased in and out of HD quality and a lower resolution. Everything else was great.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|This is one of the most listened to albums in my cloud. This band has a very good melody that just makes you want to sing along! I would recommend anything this group sings
B009UX2YAC|5.0|[Jun 5, 2013] Kiloo has improved the stability of Subway Surfers for the Kindle Fire and I now experience the same reliability with my Kindle as I do with my Android Motorola RAZR M.  However, for some reason there is still a delay in the release of the update for the Kindle Fire version of this game each month.  For example, I was able to download Miami for my RAZR M on Friday, May 31 but had to wait until Tuesday, June 4 to get the update on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Overall Subway Surfers is a really fun game to play and the monthly city changes keep the visuals fresh. Also something new is introduced each month (a new challenge, new outfits for the characters, new hoverboards, etc.)<br /><br />[Feb 13, 2013] I've had Subway Surfer for a couple of weeks and really enjoy the game.  However, today when I turned off my Kindle Fire and back on again all my coins (75,000) were gone along with items like hoverboards, trophies and missions accomplished.  The game just started all over again with instructions on how to navigate as though it were the first time I'd ever played.<br /><br />I have to wonder if the reason the game is no longer available in the Amazon Appstore is because it has this rather serious problem (because you can also pay real cash to purchase items in Subway Surfer).<br /><br />So if you're not saving coins to purchase a character and you don't plan to spend real cash on this then you'll love it as a game itself.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|A good sequel to the first. Gameplay is mostly the same, with several interesting new mechanics, and the controls respond better. Between the new level systems coin awards, and the increased amount of coins in game, new unlocks are attainable in a fairly short period of time. In summary, if you liked the first one, this one is better, and definatly worth a try as a first experience in the series.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I bought this for my wife. Saw the cheaper price and though it was a great deal like when I have bought other items. Once I got the item home, it was a cheap knockoff. The screen was loose which made it next to impossible to type with, the plastic looked cheap. The sound quality was terrible, even with the charge port opened. Complete Junk!!!  Purchased one directly from Lifeproof and  all these problems were gone. Well worth the full price!<br />Beware what you buy when it is cheaper than the original!!!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This movie helps the viewer understand what it must be like to be unable to move so little of the body. It is brilliantly acted by the entire cast. I am sorry that John Hawkes wasn't nominated for an Academy Award as he was certainly deserving. Very sensitively made giving the entire cast opportunities to shine.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|What a delightful read!  This is recommended to everyone.  Fun, easy and just the thing to take your mind off the daily &#34;woes&#34; of life.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|the graphics are awesome doesn't pester you constantlyn to buy medals or special items. nice campaign and amazing caisson game. all in all hard to top.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game all the time and have never had an issue with it.  I love how they have the world tour
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I was immediately hooked on this book.  The characters were very interesting.  The storyline was great.  A little mystery.  I would recommend this book to anyone, especially if you like reading historical fiction!
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a wonderful app that allows us to listen to what station we want! Thank you for making this free!
B008PZZV8S|3.0|While Damon does his a great in this role, his character is truly a disturbed and troubled individual. While there are good things about this movie such as the beautiful scenery and great sets, I couldn't escape the feeling that this criminal character was nothing if glorified by this movie.<br /><br />Although I've given this movie 3 stars, I wouldn't waste my time watching it again.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Which is why I purchased it. Since we have over 15 (!) of the dolls now, it seems only appropriate we collect additional merch as well. The double feature is a nice touch. My only complaint is that they are both so short. But the concept is clever and are entertaining enough to keep a grown up amused as well.
B00422LESO|3.0|Not as &#34;Austen&#34; tacious as I had hoped, but undoubtedly fun. Looking forward to the upcoming movie version with Jane Seymour!
B008CX2A2I|4.0|Works well although I have found that sometimes the receiver will suddenly change settings without me inputting anything.  When the adapter isn't plugged in the receiver works fine.  Makes life easier using my iPhone for changes though.
1881273156|5.0|Very excellently written with a lot of case histories.  Subject is applicable to everyone married or single. Reading it  has increased my understanding of how to deal effectively with others.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|WARNING.this game cheats to much this game is free I see why this game I<br />Keeps cheating<br /><br />Love mommy ok say dag the relationship between two people's
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Good and adequate app... Great for pics.. Others like dropbox offer more features and space at same cost... Wish more space for free
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Action-packed and filled with excitement, Temple Run 2 is a game worth downloading! With new obstacles like the wheel of doom and the mine barricades, this game keeps you alert and on your toes. Slide down the zip lines and take a ride in the mine cart to escape the giant evil temple beast. The new scenery adds a challenging and interesting level to this sequel.<br /><br />  Although this game is more challenging and filled with higher quality effects, some people may prefer the simplicity of the original Temple Run. However, this updated version is well worth playing. Don't let bias keep you from trying a sequel- this game is one towards which you'll be 'running'!
034580404X|5.0|E L James is an excellent writer. I fell in love with with the books.I didnt want them to end. The price for the Trilogy was cheaper than my book club
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is awesome and if you put a parental password then you won't have accidental credit card charges. I have accidentally hit the pop-ups for buying more coins or gems but my password protection prevents it from going any further. My kids would have to be pretty darn lucky to figure out my password and if they still proceeded to spend money without my permission then they would be forbidden to use my devices and grounded.

B0009VSB06|5.0|This product is very light, and easy to assemble. My husband was going all around the house last night having a lot of fun with it. My mom called, and is already trying to talk him into bringing it to her house so they can treasure hunt together, lolol...can't wait to use it for real.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I loved the way her characters were fleshed out. They were so real - I felt knew them and saw them in front of my eyes. I became very attached to them and was sorry when the book came to an end.  Great book, even though the subject was one of much pain.

B003F3FJQO|4.0|I really enjoyed book one...having the rug pulled out from under you once can be a nice change of pace...this book was still well written, but much like Thomas, I am getting somewhat annoyed with not knowing ANYTHING.<br /><br />I'm not fooling anyone, I'm going to read the next book and hopefully it will conclude my unanswered questions, but if not...then I will probably just buy the prequel...

B0027VTMAE|5.0|As a lover of old books and books on the spiritual bent. The movie traces the steps of a second hand book dealer and an expert in the occult field. Meanwhile a mysrterious woman seems to be guiding him without hom realizing it. And along the way trying to verify that the book given to him to validate ends up in Europe going to various locations and people who also have copies of the book. But finds that there are different versions of the same book. And they mysteriously die after making contact with him. Thoise into the occult would like this movie and those into books as well.

B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|I and all those closest to me have been fairly addicted to Downton Abbey. I have watched and rewatched seasons one & two, but season three has been a real letdown.  The first few episodes were fairly compelling, but they became more disjointed.  It seems now that the series is ultra successful, primary characters want out, and the only way the writers seem able to accommodate their wishes is to kill them.  Two of the best characters are now gone and one can only imagine what will be coming next.  The 2 hour final episode was choppy at best, underdeveloped, at the very least.  The new romances/relationships were all over the page; Edna eyes Tom, creepy grocer eyes Mrs. Patmore, Dr. Clarkson (a favorite of mine) eyes Mrs. Crawley.  And Rose is a non starter as is her family.  It was almost as if the trip to Scotland was filler because they didn't have any substance. Perhaps my biggest gripe was that the finale left me depressed. I can certainly wait another year for more of this.  Needless to say, my disappointment is stupefying.<br />.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|Crazy and funny book because it has to be able to get the world's most popular stories.<br /><br />Perfect book because it is a new classic to me
0394873742|5.0|Hands down my son's favorite book/toy ever.  This huge book is big enough to be cool, small enough to have tucked by the other book cubbie in our living room.  There is so much going on in here about every day life, they can't get enough.
0061339202|5.0|I am enjoying this book. It is written in a way that the lay person can understand. It's helped me identify why some of relationships at work don't work, why charming people who come on too fast usually have secret motives. We've all experienced many of these people in our lives and mostly the would not be a danger to one physically, but can and will reek havoc with you mind and emotions leaving you to feel as if you've done something wrong. You can't reason with people like this as they are incapable. Over 30 years ago, I was married to a man like this for 11 years. He is still the same as he was when he was young and charming. He has few friends left in his life, doesn't speak to most of his family, blames everything that  goes wrong on someone or something other than himself such as the government, the wife, the son, the other family members & life in general.<br />It taken me many years to realize what was wrong in our marriage and relationship. I've read many books but feel this one explains the problems quite well. I would recommend it to any woman or man who has a difficult relationship with spouse, parents, coworkers or personal relationships as these are the people who suck you dry like a vampire. It might as well be titled The Vampire Next Door.  :-)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was very well written but somewhat boring until the end.  Not the end I was expecting at all. Pretty good read.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|TVD is one of my all time favorite shows. I literally do not have enough wonderful praises for the story and cast. Every episode leaves me breathless, wanting more. These episodes NEVER disappoint. I was actually discussing this with a friend and we noted how some tv shows that you love will still, from time to time, have disappointing episodes. Maybe it was boring, nothing really happened.. etc. NOT TVD! Literally every episode turns into a new twist. The acting is incredible and unexpected. And the music weaved throughout always makes for emotional scenes. LOVE.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|The battery gauge included with the kindle fire is basically useless; it keeps showing almost full until the battery is practically drained.  So I tried the free version of this app, which was great-- accurate and honest it had all the features needed (I mean, how many features do you need in an app that tells you how much battery life is left?)  But since the app was well designed and I appreciated the opportunity to try it for free, I went ahead and bought the paid version.  For my needs its exactly the same, but I'm glad to have had the chance to show my appreciation to the developers.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of my favorites guilty pleasures.. like dark, scrumptious chocolate.<br /><br />I love this show. From the beautifully designed costumes, the attention to every little detail of furniture, layout, lightning -isn't every filmed frame exquisite?, the actors performances, to the story lines. However I've seen one beloved character departing, I am looking forward to what Season 4 will bring. Please, more Downton Abbey!

B000FCKGPC|4.0|This is a great book. Don't get me wrong. Read it and you will understand why only 4 stars. But read it you MUST. I will not be a spoiler. I personally never read reviews until I am done. Even that is perilous as there are some who are spoilers who purposely will ruin the next book. Just a warning. I Highly recommend this series to everyone. They are obviously well written and you will be quite satisfied. After finishing book 3 I joined audible.com and purchased the versions expertly narrated by Roy Dotrice. As an aside, I never thought I'd say this but I am also addicted to the Kindle Fire HD.

B008JFUMT2|1.0|This is a bad film in almost every respect. I would guess it got made, as with a couple other recent films, based on the moderate success of \\"the expendables\\". Its pure cynical explotation. Its only 97 minutes long and mostly just a bunch of bits from the earlier films mixed up and reassembled. I get the impression that nobody associated with the film even tried. From lazy camera work, to badly acted scenes, to bad music, to a script full of unfunny attempts at humor and badly planned action scenes....the film has it all.<br /><br />Most of the key people are \\"B\\" movie types. Many of them seem to have either A-Team or Max Payne on their resumes which would not usually seem to be a recommendation.<br /><br />The director really likes \\"shaky cam\\" shots from handheld cameras. I've never thought that those effects worked in action films and they don't seem to work here. They make a really big deal out of a silly, impractical weapon through most of the film. The villians are all evil Russians seemingly leftover from a 1990s film. They didn't even bother hiring good actors for the villians. Bruce Willis plays the character almost as a parody of itself. Its all just a lazy mess. Its a very bad action movie.<br /><br />----<br />Afterword:<br /><br />A couple notes on the history of the film based on things I heard and read after the review. This film was originally going to be a die hard/\\"24\\" crossover. The character that became the son in the final version was supposed to be Jack Bauer. Watching the film, that makes lots of sense to me in terms of the story. The film is a case study of why its bad to recycle scripts. There were also two directors on the project. The original director was Noam Murrow whose only credits were one indy romantic comedy and lots of TV commericals. But he left the film when he was offered the 300 sequel to direct. So in some sense, the film was a project that went on when it probably should have been stopped pre-production.<br /><br />The original idea of the crossover suggests that the reason the script doesn't quite feel like \\"die hard\\" is that it wasn't supposed to be \\"die hard\\". It was a platform to use the fame of die hard to launch a potential series of \\"24\\" films.<br /><br />With this in mind, the team on the film deserves credit for salvaging the project and turning out something while not great, was not a total joke or a disaster. Its still a bad action flim, but in my opinion the fault is with whoever decided to keep most of the old script after the \\"24\\" crossover idea was dropped.
B007V65R54|4.0|This book is an in depth look and evaluation of forecasting and prediction of all kinds of things: The weather, earthquakes, global warming, poker, political elections. Nate Silver is very smart. It gives you a great deal of insight into how forecasting and predictions are made and how to evaluate them. It is a bit long 550 pages.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This well written story stirs up so many emotions, Once I Picked it Up I could not put down. I loved All The characters In This Book. Pat Was My favorite character . We Need More Books Like This One
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I have to say when it come to computer generated animated films I was relieved that 2012 Hotel Transylvania could follow up a disaster like 2011 Rango movie and I found this even more entertaining than 2010 Mega Mind. The idea of a group of classic monsters getting together for a party in a hotel like castle reminded me  a little bit of the classic stop motion animated Halloween special from my childhood called Mad Monster Party. The monsters in this was far funnier and had a better storyline.<br /><br />After the lost of his wife Dracula built his hotel so that monsters and especially his daughter Mavis could be safe from the bigoted evils of humans. Now its Marvis' 118 birthday and she's ready to meet the outside world head on. What she didn't expect was for the outside world to come to her.  Enter the human party animal John who is always ready for a good time and bring surprises and excitment to Dracula's typically borning birthday party concepts as they fall more and more in love with one another. The catch though is that Dracula worried about what his guests might think of a human showing up in his hidden monster oasis has disguise John as a mini Frankenstein monster. Even the might of the all powerful Dracula is no match when two love birds hear the zing of cupid's arrows.

B003B96AOW|5.0|Great quality. The look and presentation is 100% spot on. The weapons are sturdy and durable. The paint job is the best I've seen. I love everything about this Deadpool action figure.

1439102813|5.0|While reading the last few chapters of this book, I was compelled to stop, pull up my email and send a love letter to my husband.  I told him I was reading a book about a woman with Alzheimers and wanted him to know just how much and what it is about him that I love, just in case one day I couldn't remember.  This book made me feel like 100 years still isn't enough time to spend with the ones you love, much less if their minds leave long before their bodies.  I felt so much sorrow for Alice and her family and so much gratitude that I am still able to recognize and convey my emotions to my family  Gripping, fascinating, and hearbreaking- this is one you won't be able to put down.<br /><br />My only complaint is the way the book ends.  I felt like I was being led and prepared to know Alice's true ending, but the final chapter obviously ends before she does.  I would have been curious to know what happened a couple of months later.  Then again, if Alice's ending had been told, it likely wouldn't have been from her viewpoint, which is what made this book so hauntingly truthful.
B0090SI42Y|1.0|I am not going to get into the story or plot because it really is not important...at all. The intended audience is for people who want to watch a kick ass movie with awesome kung fu fight scenes and they fail miserably at that. None of the characters have any charm or \\"coolness\\" about them that all classic kung fu movies have. Russell Crowe, is the only one with any grit or screen presence but even his notable acting chops and charisma can't elevate this sorry excuse of an action movie.<br /><br />You know why people love old school kung fu movies? Because of the action, the stars that perform amazing kung fu moves, the wacky but charming stories/characters are always secondary to the action. We love action movies and if you give us this in spades, we will endure any plot holes, annoying characters, cheesy comedy bits, terrible dialogue and non-existent or plausible character development or twists.<br /><br />There is too much wire fu and flashy, close up editing that robs the viewer of any appreciation of the physical skills or fight choreographed intricacies. We see lots of blood and gore (decapitations, mutilations, blood squirts, skull and knee smashing) but we hardly ever see any actual fighting! We see people fly (via obvious use of wires) on top of a table, yell, and then we see a semblance of limbs flailing around but mostly a close up an ugly face. That killed any leniency I had already built up before seeing this boring dreck of an action movie.<br /><br />Would Jackie Chan be so loved if we never actually saw his death-defying stunts and brilliant fight scenes due to MTV ADD like editing? Would Bruce Lee be a movie star icon if we never saw his inhuman speed and power in its entirety? Or better yet would Van Damme be better regarded in his early days if they didn't constantly do a close up of his ass every time he threw his otherwise awesome kicks?<br /><br />Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon had 10x the fight choreography and talent than this dreadful homage to the old school chop socky flicks. Kill Bill has 10x the charm and wit than this garbage.<br /><br />The Raid: Redemption is the current king of modern martial arts movie for me and bonafide classic and a benchmark that all modern kung fu movies must aspire to...<br /><br />this movie is like a generic mid-90's direct-to-video kung fu movie but a needlessly HUGE budget. This movie is not mindless fun...it is just mindless nothing less and definitely nothing more.

B007JVJ3C4|3.0|I agree with other reviewers, this is a much more &#34;true to comic&#34; Ghost Rider, it's just too bad that Nicholas Cage is the actor. They should have done a &#34;Hulk&#34; on this and given us a new lead actor
0345803485|1.0|Creepy stalker, who happens to be a young, drop-dead handsome,self made billionaire, meets naive, unsophisticated, not-so-drop-dead gorgeous graduate. She agrees to a contractual relationship that allows him complete control over every aspect of her life. He makes it clear that there will be no boyfriend/girlfriend thing. The plot development, in the very weakest sense possible is that, unlike the many others before her, he actually falls for her, even though her attributes seem limited to lip pursing, eye rolling, & turning various shades of scarlet. It must be the erotic scenes inserted into the otherwise painfully drab, unconvincing storyline that keep the readers coming back for more. The author would be embarrassed if she wasn't laughing all the way to the bank.

B005K17RU0|4.0|As far as I can tell this only tells you the weather for the next 24 hours or so.

All I could do was imagine that maybe she got help at some point or not and would continue to think she's ok after her talk with her high school friend's sister....????? Entertaining though..

B008MIMWOO|5.0|ok, if you buy this you already know the movies and what your favs are.  let me talk about the blu-ray case.  i wasnt sure what was going to come in the mail because i've seen this release in a couple different ways.this is a 3 disc set, all in one normal size blu-ray case, which is what i was wanting. not the 3 super slim cases in a cheap card board box.  anyway, great buy for the price and well worth the upgrade to blu.. enjoy

B001ANSSDC|5.0|This story inspires me and makes me want to live. I miss my brother and sister and my friends and my therapist. I love the honesty of the writing and the characters. This is one of the best books I've read. Thoroughly enjoyable on many many levels.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator. My special feature is it works similar to an adding machine.. The memory saves everything you added previously. Nice.....  You delete it when you are done. I love it.
B005LAII62|5.0|This movie was great! I laughed a lot while watching it, and I wasn't even drinking beer or anything. A good sense of humor, good plot, great animation!!! Worth every penny I paid and hopefully a sequel.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|My kids love this game. They play it all the time. I review all Apps and play each game also. I must say the kids have to teach me how to play but I play. I like to play this game too. Once I start the kids have to wait their turn. It is addicting.
B0041KJ9SO|5.0|This is a great soundtrck it's fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
B00973902K|5.0|I have listed to this song so many times from my kids playing it  that it almost gets on my nerve. Awesome addition to the music library.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is one of the top 10 albums, ever.  Each tract is engaging and different and the  album as a whole is put to together so moving from track to track is seemless.  Adele has such an engaging voice.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|I was having trouble loading this app to my kindle. I called Amazon technical support and they informed me that this app is not compatible with Kindle HD. They instructed me to delete this app. I did as instructed. I was excited to use it. Maybe they can get one compatible for the HD model.
B00A3AUGEW|3.0|I love Phillip Phillips! I was a huge supporter when he was on Idol last year. I was kind of disappointed in the CD. Although there are a few songs that I really like it is just kind of boring. I wish they could have put a little more soul into it like he did in his live performances.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|One of the best Jack Reacher novels full of action and suspense from the start to the finish.<br />This book leave the mind wondering about what really goes on in the world.<br />Anyone who loves a good adventure story with intrigue and action all the way through.
B00899F0G8|4.0|ALthough I love this show I hated having to pay to watch it! But Amazon makes it really easy! That is a huge plus!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse feels great and it fits well on my hands. I just wished the third button on the side was a little higher so I didnt need to bend my thumb to reach it.  Other than that, its fully customizable and a great replacement for my RAT 7 mouse that started to die after 6 months.  It's also cheap for such a great quality.
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|When I started to read this book I felt like this was the best book ever. I really liked the series and I hope more books come out.
B00683JK9K|3.0|I like relaxing and doing jigsaw puzzles, The pictures in this app are beautiful. I like being able to select how hard I want the puzzle to be by selecting how many total pieces I want to work with and if I want to have to rotate them to get them to fit. I only came across one problem and I'm not sure if it's just my phone being unresponsive sometimes or if it's the game, but sometimes when trying to take a piece out of the sidebar, it wouldn't pick it up. I'd have to try a few times til it would pick it up. It only has a few pictures to pick from so I wouldn't pay more than .99 cents. The menu makes it look like you can add more pictures if you buy them in packages or something like that. Cause it has a folder for All Pictures and a folder for Seasons, but the Seasons pictures are the only ones in the All Pictures folder. Both folders have the same pics.<br />I do recommend this game though, if your a puzzle lover.
B008AX1HD8|5.0|As always suspense filled I really enjoyed the Australian connection Jo Nesbos books are well worth a read I can never put them down
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|I normally don't like these kinds of games. I don't like to be rushed. But I tried it as the Free App of the Day and it was actually really fun. It's KINDA like lemmings but with only 1 lemming. It can get pretty difficult on some levels. There are lots of different variations of levels and things to collect and that makes it enjoyable to go back and try to get gold medals on all of them. Try new strategies. The character is so cute and I like the look of the game. I think that now that I know how fun it is, I'd pay for it. I don't know what it's normal price is but I think Its worth up to 3 dollars. I'd pay $3 for it, if I had to... :)<br />I recommend this game.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Typical Bond action all the way. Daniel Craig is awesome as Bond. This one did not have as much action as some of the others but I will be watching it again without hesitation.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I was recommended this read by my college professor.  Hey enjoyable and so deep on a wide multitude of areas.
B009POCG0Y|3.0|This shows the darker side of my hero Matthew Mcconaughey. It was ok to watch the first time but unless you are a die hard MM lover, this is far from his best.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is really fun to play on but hard to move the screen once in a while<br />But still fun and challenging
B009EEFTMC|1.0|I was really glad to see this as FAOTD. I have tried 5 times to install it and it keeps saying there is an error. Frustrating!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome! I especially like the mine carts. It makes the first Temple Run look really, really easy.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book explains why the Atkins diet works. It is all about losing the wheat. I have dairy allergies. I wish the recipes included dairy free options.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a fun game I really like it and it's very addicting and I love when it tours. I love the golden boxes and the gold.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|If you loved the original Star Wars movie with all it's new aliens, locations and weapons, you will love this movie.
B009UMTMKS|5.0|This book turns the top-down, waterfall, write and execute a business plan method on its head.  In order to find a winning business model you have to prepare to fail multiple times, adjust your approach, test assumptions, find something that works by trial and error.  You're exploring uncharted territory.  In order to fail multiple times without burning through piles of cash and years of effort you have to take a lightweight, pragmatic approach.  You have to get out in the field with customers or clients, tap tap tap, find something that resonates.  A lot of people who start businesses start by executing what they are certain is their killer idea.  A big gamble.  What if it isn't so killer?  This book will help you channel that killer idea energy into exploration and discovery, and in the process put you in touch with the people who will pay you for your efforts.  So much fun.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Very professional product. I've never heard music so clear and crisp. No distortion. First time I used on one of my favorite tunes, I heard percussion instruments I hadn't heard before.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly never fails to entertain.  I've read all of his books, and they all have been exactly what I expected from a good mystery.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|series recommended by coworker.  Found inside working of a big estate interesting and the personalities diverse.  Was able to get up to speed on this years episodes.  Have recommended to others.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|It took me awhile to learn to get around in this app but now that I have, I love it.  I have found many radio stations of all kinds I like.  The best part is tuning into anywhere in the world.  I like listening to the stories.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have this site on my laptop and use it all the time to follow our weather forcasts.  Was useful during our last snow storm.  Would recommend it to someone who follows the weather.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a very colorful and fun movie.  It definitely has underlying messages about how to treat the environment and that is a positive thing.  This is my 3 yr olds favorite movie and it is a great deal on sale.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I love this app.  TED talk discussions are usually pretty good.  There's a wide variety of selection of discussions on many topics.  All are very informative.  Get it, if you like to expand your own knowledge on many different topics.
B009PHRIAE|5.0|This is one of those rare occasions when you can buy this item blindly.<br />It's not just an edition of a miraculous playing of the recoder,<br />but a superb musical event for all lovers of music and especially of ancient music.<br />For lovers of the recorder it's of course a reason for a delightful feast.<br /><br />There's no need to introduce Frans Bruggen - he is one of the great fathers of the ancient music revival and performance in the second half of the 20th century.<br />All the recordings here are from the 60's and the 70's, but up to our days i can't find any recorder player which satifies me as Bruggen in respect of expressive musicallity and tone richness and beauty (exept perhaps Pedro Memelsdorf and Hugo Reyne, but their amount of recordings for the recorder is so small that it's difficult to judge).<br />His ideas are always refreshing and convincing, but very attentive and to the point and not exaggerated.<br />Of course, he was surrounded and assited by some of the finest musicians in the world of ancient music, who played with him joyfully in these recordings, e.g., The recorder players Kees Boeke and walter van Hauwe (who were his pupils), the cellist Anner Bylsma and the great Gustav Leonhardt.<br /><br />The only reservation i have is that some of the concertos (for example, those by Telemann)sounds today somewhat heavy and romantic, but the blame is on the orchestra alone(or rather on the period of the recording...).<br /><br />Most of the cd's in this edition where long out of stock and where sold (in Amazon too) for ridiculously high prices. Now you can buy the whole edition, new, in less than what was asked for one used cd.<br /><br />The recordings are excellent with a rich and full tone (unlike a lot of the thin modern recordings of this instrument).<br /><br />Snatch it, before this too will be out of stock.
B009EEFTMC|1.0|I have played each mode once, and I'm done.  The basic mode is too easy.  Just can't see myself playing over and over just to beat my time.  What I like about mahjong is the levels that are hard to beat, that you have to try several times to get them. No equivalent challenge here. Glad it was faotd.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|A really enjoyable game and highly addictive, although I am pretty useless. I will persevere though and aim to light at least some of the stars.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|this story makes you think about love and life.  to only find true love and friendship like that, would be great.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think the game is fun... I have it my kindle fire and when you want to start the game it pops up an adverticement and sometimes it freezes your game... it has lost all my results and money and stuff 2 times...other then that that game is a lot of fun and does not require a high skill legal.. if u need a hobby that u can do any where then this a good game for u!
B00009UTQD|3.0|I am not a fan of filter, just wanted to find something to keep a couple of polarised filters and a ND filters.<br /><br />With this Tmarac, glasses touch to the soft wall of the pack. Not a big issue but it happens that filters got more dust on them every time I take them out of this Tamrac and I simply cannot accept that.<br /><br />So, I went back to used my hard B+W filter box which came with the ND filter that I bought before. I just remove the soft foam in the box and can keep 3 of my filters stacked in it. It's light, neat, safe, simple, easy and it works much better than the Tamrac<br /><br />Five stars for Amazon
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a fun game that will give hours of play.  My whole family loves this app as does my two year-old grandson.
0525953728|5.0|I bought the book as soon as it came out because it sounded like it may be recalled or censored in some way.  I enjoyed reading this SEALS story, this is the first book that I ever read the last chapter first.  I don't understand the reasons the SEALS felt the book should not have been written but since I read it I felt compelled to donate to one of the Navy SEAL foundations.  I guess I always thought the Navy took care of SEALS in need and had never heard of the Navy SEAL Foundation, Tip of the Spear, or All In All The Time Foundations.  I've read that two of those charities have refused to except donations from proceeds of this book.  After discussing it with my wife we chose to donate to the Navy SEAL Foundation, I've also became a customer of the US Navy SEAL Store.  With the simple writing style of this book I would rate it at 3 or 4 stars but because it brought out some something positive in me as a good book should, I rate it 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and is can keep ur attention for a while is just a fun gane so get it right and have a great time. Also if u have a facebook sign in a lnd play with ur friends on facebook
B004HXIZVC|5.0|This app will allow me to store my music in the cloud and not take up space on my devices.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I find Temple Run 2 to be more engaging with improved graphics and incentives to play. I find myself playing late into the night.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|Big thumbs up to the people who make this show.  It just proves that you can make a decent childrens show that keeps children entertained and not have a lot of &#34;flash&#34;
B00992CF6W|4.0|Its one cool app for a game like this. But the best is in PC and Xbox 360. I love Minecraft because of mining fighting and addiction.
B002QNTNL6|1.0|I was not impressed with What a Girl Wants. There's more to a girl than just being sexy and appealing.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|OMG I'm so HAPPY for this Gift Set! one of my favorite movies ever! an INCREDIBLE 80's MOVIE! SO EXCITING!!!!!!!!!!

B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Very entertaining, but a very very short book. I wouldn't recommend this book because it is not worth the money.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|This sequel was excellent. Sometimes a little drawn out , but a great adventure. Definitely worth the read! Hard to put down!
0375703764|4.0|I had heard this book mentioned in a discussion of scariest books ever, and, while I might not give it that, the book does have some terrifying moments. What makes it shine ultimately is the utterly insane writing style, that at times is wildly difficult to read, and at others completely enveloping. Either way the book is a wild ride, both plot-wise and writing-wise, with twists at every turn and enough mysteries to keep me intrigued long after I put this one up on my shelf. Points to anyone who can solve them all.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This is a must be every DVD collection.  The action of each movie and the extras are the best.  Great price and fast shipping earns this seller an AAA+++ rating
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game can be as challenging or relaxing as you want.  You can play at a fast and frantic pace  to obtain a fast time and post it.  Or you can  just admire the colors and patterns as you use swipes and taps to rotate the large cube and remove matching blocks in pairs.  The game tracks your score locally, so you can compete against yourself in privacy and/or play without an internet connection.  I found the swipe and tap controls to be responsive and with pinpoint accuracy on Kindle Fire HD.  SUMMARY:  5 Stars<br /><br />The colors and patterns are bright and sharp, and the cube is faithfully rendered at any angle as you rotate it.  SUMMARY:  Awesome!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Amazing the lessons we learn about ourselves and others we meet on our journey when we take the time to look and listen.
B005FPT51K|5.0|Excellent experience !!! I received everything correctly, the performance and quality of the product is just as I expected !!!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A must read!! I couldn't put it down. So many twists and turns that you don't expect. Very well written.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the ultimate love story! Loved every page!!<br />Nicholas Sparks has eloquently written a tale of love and understanding that we can all hope for!

B0000C3I6U|5.0|Great to see the king in his glory!  This man was a top of his game when this was made.
0307236722|5.0|Love this book, can't go wrong with it, the Olive Oil Bread is worth buying the book for.Bought this one for my daughter.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I loved this book.  It is a very good story.  The movie is nowhere as good as the book.  The kindle version makes the pictures rather small however.
B008NF45S2|1.0|It flat out doesn't work with the kindle!!!! I have to move save edit drag its miss advertised for kindle users they say their working on correcting it !!! Probably have it resolved in about 2 or 3 thousand more sales ?
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This is an outstanding tale that kept me interested and eagerly awaiting the sequel.  The use of vintage photography really added to the story.  I don't recommend the kindle version if you can help it, the pictures are just too small.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Yes, I Highly Recommend For Fans Of Teen Wolf To Get This DVD!!! See The Very Beginning Of Teen Wolf & How They Got To Be Who They Are Now!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I loved this game.  it has a great storyline to it.  the grafics are wonderful as well.  I had a little trouble along the way, but it wouldn't be much fun if I could finish it in a day.

B0018RWD1S|5.0|Super happy with this purchase. I love Amy Winehouse. This is probably one of my favorite CD's by her. Thanks
B004EPYZP8|5.0|This is a great movie. Verty entertaining but true to life. Our legal system is so corrupted, this movie shows the reasons we have no justice in the USA except if a person is wealthy and can afford a lawyer.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|It may be a copycat of some other recent works by other popular action writers, but Baldacci can tell a good tale in his own way and this one was pretty good. Some of his more recent work has been kind of bland. This one wasn't. Lots of action and good characters. He should continue with this character in the future. I'd buy the sequel.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|Anyone who loves animals should watch this movie!! I cried and laughed watching Hachi! I watched this movie a long time ago and I am happy I bought this to add to my collection of animal movies!!!
1419705849|5.0|My grandson has read almost all of these books. I thought this one to be perfect for Valentine's Day. I am sure he will enjoy it.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is a great app where you can play some classic chess. You can even change the difficulty, so that you can play as hard as you want. The best part is that... IT'S FREE
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I started playing with my elementary school aged kids. I got totally sucked in. I put them to bed 2 hours ago and I'm still playing.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Bought this as a spare to keep in the car. Well worth the money. Same quality that came with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.
B00BFU76LU|5.0|I can only echo the views of my fellow reviewers (three to date):  Constantin Silvestri is indeed one of the top ten (I would say top half-dozen) most underappreciated conductors.  I, too, purchased the ten-CD set from Disky at an exorbitant price a few years ago.  I do not, however, regret that decision, for that set has given me enormous enjoyment.  Now the prospect of having the remainder of Silverstri's EMI recordings in my collection (minus his collaborations with Francois and Menuhin) is more than worth the nominal cost of the entire 15-CD collection.<br /><br />SIlverstri's Dvor&aacute;k and Tchaikovsky are justly famous for their combination of visceral excitement with intelligent musicianship. But Silvestri's repertoire was huge; he does equally well with composers as diverse as Elgar, Shostakovitch, Rimsky-Korsakoff, and Ravel.  Much though I admire Silvestri's fellow-countryman, Celibidache (particularly in Bruckner), I have to say that the former is by far the more consistently satisfying conductor.  His interpretations never wear out their welcome with repeated hearing, as can those of Celibidache.  Among great conductors of which I am aware, Silvestri's interpretive priorities most resemble those of Cantelli in favoring swift (but not breathless) tempos, beautifully sustained cantabile phrasing, incisive rhythmic articulation without abruptness, carefully \\"etched\\" coloristic detail, and perfectly balanced orchestral textures. Why, then, is his artistry not better known?  Why has EMI waited so long to revive his recorded legacy?<br /><br />However one is inclined to answer these questions, we must be grateful for this massive retrospective edition of a conductor who deserves another chance at the limelight.<br /><br />P.S.:  And while you're at it, obtain the Carl Schuricht box from EMI/Icon.  Another sadly underappreciated conductor, somewhat less well served by EMI (though what he did record for that label is treasureable).
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good game especially for young girls that love horses. good game for all ages - even our 3 yr old girl. does slow down from time to time. would recommend.
B000MV90IU|5.0|I purchased this for my husband, He claimed it was one of the best iconic car movies ever made. thank goodness I did because I absolutely loved it.
B00973902K|5.0|All good, easy to download, fun to listen to while working on computer.<br />The Cloud works easy and no problems
B003JBHQP4|3.0|Works ok , - but would have preferred a more positive channel system for guiding the flash cards to the pins.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Not just hip hop but music in general need's more artist like Macklemore.  This cat has something to say and nothing's gonna stop him from saying it.  AMAZING music!!!
B006BXT4TI|5.0|Their sound is not traditional, but timeless. Good music does not have to fit the mold that &#34;Pop music&#34; has created. And believe me this is way better than the &#34;I can only sing one kind of song, Taylor Swift&#34;. Just saying.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|by far the finest insight into what was happening prior to and during the Civil War<br />a must read for any student of the time of Lincoln<br />shows the human element of not just Lincoln but of those he chose to<br />assist in retaining the American form of government<br />do not miss this story
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish.  Would recommend this to anyone. I will go see the monie too.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. It is so entertaining. There are ads but not that many. It is so much fun playing this game everyday.
1452110581|5.0|If you have ever needed a little gift item for the cat lover in your life . . . BUY THIS BOOK! Have a couple on hand to send . . and keep one for yourself!  The poems are not 'cutesy' or 'fluff,' they are almost haiku in form and flow.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I love Jack White and once again everything he does is unbelievably awesome! He is just one of my favorites. The songs are all good. I can't say that one is better than the other, just so exceptional!!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The first book I have read by this author. I would recommend it to others. Very interesting to read it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is A very good game I like it at first I like temple run two but this is better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book in my opinion is the best in the series and I think you would like it. Hope you do enjoy the series especially this book.
B007V65R54|4.0|Very worthwhile read. The emphasis on a Bayesian approach when making predictions is very good.  His willingness to take on Fischer should cause some waves (though I may be over optimistic here).  He is still a classicist in that he believes that there is really \\"a\\"  scientific method.  The book is a bit longer than it needs to be imho.  He has a tendency to beat his points to death.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing but it wouldn't make sense to read this book before the other two. Hope you like it.
0446554995|5.0|As a fervent reader of preston and child, I waited since the announcement in June of its release in December, and ordered<br />it immediately in December. As usual, I read this in a few days. had a tough time putting it down.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This book is ok probably the best of the series but it's not the best book in the world. You should read it though because it's funny.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I'm not sure if you have to be over the hill (as I am),  to love this movie  (as I did) about a home for retired musicians,  but it certainly appears that way to me after coming home and  reading A. O. Scott's middling  New York Times review and its online reader responses, which seem to be either total disdain or absolute delight and nothing in between.<br /><br /> It probably helps to have a lifelong love of classical music, especially opera, with just a smidgen of Gilbert & Sullivan & vaudeville mixed in.<br /><br />While, as expected, Maggie Smith, Pauline Collins, Tom Courtenay, Billy Connolly and Michael Gambon are superb in the leading roles,  the supporting player-musicians, who also inhabit the beautiful, scenic Beecham House, some of whom are familiar faces but most of whom I'd  never heard of, are a  joy to behold as well.  Please be sure to stay for the closing credits where you'll see headshots of each of them  as they are now and as they were in a key role from  their heydays.<br /><br />No one sums it up better than  Ann Hornaday in her rave review in the January 24, 2013 Washington Post: \\"Smoothly navigating the perilous line between insufferably twee and heartbreakingly grim, \\"Quartet\\" is a subtle, sure-footed delight -- made all the more enjoyable by the fact that it was directed by a 75-year-old first-timer named Dustin Hoffman.  Judging from this debut, the kid's got a future.\\"<br /><br />RE THE DVD EXTRAS: There's a batch of short clips of the leading actors talking about the movie and what it was like to work with Hoffman.  But my fave is Hoffman's commentary track.  You get the impression of an old friend sitting alongside you with his feet up, filling you in on the story behind the creation of these scenes, how they found all those wonderful old musicians for the supporting roles, sharing anecdotes about the actors and production challenges, pointing out  how much of what's on screen was in the script and how much (quite a lot) was improvised. (Example: Pauline Collins's request--which was granted--that she adapt and play her character as being in the early stages of  dementia, modeled on her own real-life mother.) It's great fun to go back to the movie for another look with DH's  insights and anecdotes and backgrounders in mind.<br /><br />I'm thinking this DVD might make just the right double feature for \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.\\".

B0070Y46UY|4.0|You may think that this is a story about a man in a lifeboat with a Tiger after the ship taking him and his father's zoo animals to Canada is sunk. But it's much more than that. Martel's description of his life in India and his dabbling in 3 different religions could make a separate book in its own right. And the story of his survival after more than 200 days drifting across the Pacific is gripping. Then there's the ending that leaves you wondering about what you have just read. An usual book but a compulsive read.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|So much more pleasant than an alarm clock with the garrish digital letters staring at you and I love being able to roll over and check the weather before I'm even out from under the covers. Living in the Northwood weather always plays a huge part on how to plan my day, especially in winter. The backgrounds are very aesthetically pleasing and make this a pleasure to use.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I can't wait to season two. It will be hard to maintain the same level of drama and credibility as in season 1.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very interesting to get view from this time period all while be entertained by great acting and characters.  The costumes are so cool.  Highly recommend this series.
B009X01ELC|5.0|Got this for my kindle and it is fabulous.  able to rotate the kindle 360 degrees and the tilt stand adjustments are great.  Case is fairly padded, offers nice protection.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is the most realistic horse app Ive ever seen. I play on a kindle fire and there is only one problem. If I click on the app from my carosuel it wont load but it does when I click open in the app store. Please fix. THANKS!!!
B00APACSJG|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I liked this book and if you are a fan of the Vor saga... you definitely need to read this book.<br /><br />That being said, I felt it lacked some of the energy , the youth of the other books in the series. A little on the short side, and Miles feels... older.<br />Which I suppose he SHOULD. But you know... it also felt a bit sad to see one of my favorite book characters of all time... getting old... a little...<br /><br />So I liked it, it wasn't as adventurous as the other books in the series maybe, but it still gave me a little twinge of sadness seeing Miles... all grown up like that.<br />hehehe.<br /><br />Maybe the author is preparing him for the next phase in his life, one can always hope...
B00009W0U4|3.0|Monica Bellucci is super hot. The acting though, not so much. It was decent. Original concept of starting from the end and playing backwards. That was cool.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you enjoy science-Fiction and if you are above 40yo... you HAVE to read this book!!!<br /><br />It's totally fun, well written, action packed with a great story.<br /><br />Go ahead... read it!
B007V5CF5K|4.0|I had a lot of fun with this game. It was a little different then the usual hidden object games that I like. I thought it was a good length and just challenging enough. It never failed that I would need the hint button for 1 or 2 of the last items in a room. I hate having to restore to using the hints.<br />My only issue with it was that is would close on me every so often. Sometimes several time in just a few minutes. The only good thing is it would go right back to where I was in the game. I might of had to pick up 1 or 2 items again but at least I did not lose a ton of progress.<br />I will still get the next game in the series, though I hope that little bug is fixed. Oh us, I am using the Kindle Fire hd.
B006YTTVHO|2.0|Yes, it was free.  It has some useful nuggets, the rest if you didn't already know you must have been living in a remote forest without any contact with other humans all your life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I recently bought this game for my Kindle Fire and I absoulutely love it!! This is one of the best games and I think everybody should have it. You jump over obstacles, collect coins, and also collect other things... LOADS OF FUN!!! ...You need to get it!!
0790729725|5.0|It's De Niro and Pesce, how can it be bad?!?  Now you put Liotta in the mix, with the rest of the crew, and it becomes one of the most entertaining gangster movies of it's time.  Not one time are you pulled out of the movie due to some unbelievable move that would only happen in the movies.
B0068THAGY|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS REALLY GOOD,  NO IT 'S NOT BEN HUR BUT FOR THE TYPE OF MOVIE IT IS IT REALLY FLIES. TOLD FROM SOME TEENS POINT OF VIEW,  IT IS NONE THE LESS BELIEVABLE. AND SUSPENSEFUL. THE STORY IS OLD HAT : SPACE MONSTER CRASHES ON EARTH,  HUMANS ACT LIKE THE REAL MONSTERS,  ALIEN RUNS AMUCK. BUT YOU END UP ROOTING FOR THE KIDS,  ( THE REAL INTELLEGENCE ) AND FOR FRIENDSHIP, FAMILY, YOUNG LOVE,  & EVEN THE ET.  TOO HARSH FOR YOUNG KIDS, TWEENS AND UP WILL ENJOY THE RIDE.
0783225792|5.0|It's De Niro and Pesce, how can it be bad?!?!  Classic gangster movie set in the 'legit' casino fashion.  The best!
B005LA3Z9M|4.0|I thought this might be a reinvention of Chocolat' or such but with flowers! However I was pleasantly surprised. Better than I expected and the flower side of it was really interesting without overwhelming the storyline.  A very enjoyable and well written read. I have referred to the dictionary of flowers several times already. Most interesting.
6305546789|5.0|If you don't know this movie, you're from another planet...  Arguably the best horror film of it's time, and I argue that it is!!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I found I prefer to use the web version on my regular phone.  for one thing its hard to key in passwords on my kindle.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Thinking this was just another mah jong-type game, I decided not to get it.  It was the reviews that caused me to take a closer look. I'm glad I did!<br /><br />Unlike mah jong, this is simply a 3D matching game.  Pieces do not need to be unblocked.  You can match anywhere, on any side, at any depth.<br /><br />The rotation control and  turning animation are very smooth, making it easy to move around the cube freely.<br /><br />Piece selection is very accurate.  I'm playing on a 5&quot; mobile screen, and was able to select pieces that were only showing a corner, at extreme angles, or deep within the cube.<br /><br />I have a couple of complaints that dropped my rating down to 4 stars:<br /><br />- the end screen blocks the final score and time.<br />- I'd like to be able to see my personal top 10 scores.<br />- the explosion animation temporarily obstructs the view of the pieces beneath the pair.  I'd prefer a configuration option to disable it.<br />- it would be nice to have the ability to set the swipe rotation speed.<br /><br />Overall, a surprisingly fun game!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I love G5 hidden object games,and this one did not disappoint. Yes its a shorter game than usual G5 games,but the price is right. Option to skip through puzzles. Plenty of hidden object games.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I did not know this existed.<br />Or is this pure fiction, only to make a person's mind alert to anything is possible.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I am really hooked on this series.  Every episode is unique and interesting.  It keeps drawing me back for more
B0090X4GLW|5.0|If you loved the movie, the soundtrack is a MUST!!! We listen to it every day. Only thing missing is Titanium :(
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This is a great game, particularly being free. I have found it to be challenging and great fun to play. A must have in your game folder.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|We love this CD. We watched Cher Lloyd on the X Factor and this CD is great! Stays true to her style.
B0084HJE0S|3.0|If you want to be introduced to HTML5, maybe this book is a nice starting!<br />Here you can find what are the improvements from previous HTML and web paradigm in the developer and end user's viewpoint.<br /><br />You should have a previous simple web development experience with HTML and JavaScript.
B007F7QG0Y|4.0|Keith is an interesting subject with so many short stories to reveal from a lifetime of being on the road and interesting characters he has been involved with.
B0058YPL66|5.0|The more I see the more I'm drawn into the story lines of Once Upon a Time...... soo many twists and turns in the plot keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more and more  and it only gets better ...... LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
B000UJ48O0|5.0|A Christmas present for my 24 yo. granddaughter. She loved it and the presentation box was perfect. Price was the best around.
0345803493|5.0|This is by far the best book of the trilogy. I started it on a Friday, and by Sunday I was done with it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It has large numbers so anyone can use it, easy it's easy to use.  Color coded so easy to find things fast.
0345803507|3.0|I'm finishing this mostly because it's a trilogy and I want to know what happens, but have to be honest here....the sex scenes are becoming boring, she uses the same words to describe the same situations, and frankly I've lost interest.
B0060CV31C|5.0|It's funny, quirky, and cute. Great lines to quote with your friends. Pleasing characters, good moral, and great to rewatch.
0385342063|5.0|I absolutely love Sophia Kinsella.  Her Shopaholic mini series kept me reading for months.  She definitely did not skimp on this book.  I could hardly put it down.  The characters in the book were just perfect...I really hope there is a part 2!
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Creative, fun, and the special effects are still fantastic. Some of the songs have a touch of melancholy, but that's a good thing.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|when I got the update it stooped working it used to be great until it wouldn't load. I tried to remove it and downloaded it again but it said I cant remove it so I have a ghost application that haunts me
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|The kids are better than I am :) This is a fun game, much like Mario brothers. Works great on my kindle fire
B000FCKGPC|2.0|GRRM seemed to go off the tracks a bit with this novel. I have to say it was an exercise in determination to slog through a lot of it. Unfocused chapters circling around inconsequential new characters. I realize this is and the next novel were meant to be one, but the delete button could've been liberally used for a lot of this novel. Way too many new, uninteresting and pointless characters to keep track of, which distracted me from the storyline and main characters. By the time we got back to them, I had pretty much forgotten what was going on. I found the introduction of so many new superfluous characters to not only be a bit annoying, but also pointless. Character A  is introduced, given a small story arc and then the arc ends with a tenuous tie, at best, to any main storyline. I found myself asking, more than once, &#34;what was the point of that?&#34;<br /><br />The previous books in the series were AWESOME page turners that I couldn't put down. I'm hoping GRRM gets back to that kind of tight, imaginative and stunning storytelling in the next book.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Classic that is well worth the purchase.  First Blue-Ray we bought and son wants to watch it all year round.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|What more am I supposed to say then its a bluray just like if you were to buy it from walmart?
B00846REIS|4.0|A great read.... the story line was always moving forward. A lot like Fifty Shades. I would recommend this book to a friend.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very good quality. Game deal choices are good. Love that you can get hints when you are stuck. Great fun!
B005FISBV2|5.0|Amazon shipped this blu-ray so it arrived the day it came out and it was in perfect condition.  As for this season of Dexter, it's not the best season, but it's still Dexter and even the bad ones are still good.  Well worth the money.  I still think Dexter is one of the best shows on TV these days.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I am a huge Josh Groban fan and this album is amazing. I could listen to it for a long time.
0393068382|5.0|I wish everyone would read this book. It really exposed to me the bias of pseudoscience supposedly &#34;proving&#34; an innate psychological difference between the sexes. After reading this, I realize that myths about the brain are EVERYWHERE. It's an enlightening piece of feminist literature!
B00A8KJN14|5.0|A new classic which looks stunning on blu-ray. Ill continue to buy all of Burtons films. 5 stars well deserved!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is a flawless singer and her voice transports you to a happy place in your mind and feels great
B009329Y30|4.0|Heart touching movie on dealing with hurry and lost in life. ... ... ... ... ... . . . .  . ... . . . ....
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Hugh Laurie is an amazing singer as well as a well known actor. This cd was a revelation that I love
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have all of Susan Boyle's CDs and admire her impressive voice and delivery.  After reading lukewarm review in a magazine, had decided not to get this one.  I knew my brother was interested in it, told him of the review I'd read and he told me of a great review he'd read, so we each have the CD and both enjoy it.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|Mayer was on Sunday Morning and that was the first time I heard of him and was an instant fan. His cd is wonderful
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I really like the first app. This game is however much better. graphics are better!Doesn't lag either. So just go for it, download it. :D
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Anything Michael Buble' puts out is stellar in my book. He is such a talented artist that I look forward to any work he does
B00005JMJG|5.0|Watched this with my wife on Valentines Day, and was blown away by how original and thought provoking this movie is. The plot revolves around the idea of a couple erasing their memory to forget each other. While the plot is intriguing, where this movie really shines is with character devolpment. Both main characters are very relatable, and Carrey, and Winslet deliver a stunning performance playing Joel and Clementine. All in all, a brilliantly written movie that fires on all cylinders. If you're looking for a romantic movie that actually makes you think, this one is definitely for you.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|I realize that my lower rating of Season 3 will not be popular. First, let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed the entire first two seasons of Downton Abbey. The story lines, scenery, and acting were all brilliant. Season 3 was wonderful as well until you hit the very end of the finale, the \\"A Journey to the Highlands\\" episode.<br /><br />** SPOILER ALERT ** When Matthew is killed in a car wreck on the way back from seeing his new born son the show just seemed to plunge too deep into darkness. Let's review: Cybil dies after childbirth; Lord and Lady Grantham's marriage is strained greatly as Lady Grantham blames Cybil's death in part on Lord Grantham's decision; much of the season has poor Bates in prison so Anna and Bates are apart; Tom struggles with Cybil's death; Lady Edith is interested in a married man, a man that is married to a women in an insane asylum so for some reason he is unable to get a divorce; when we meet Shrimpee (sp) we find that he is in a miserable marriage; then Lady Mary and Matthew happily great their new born son, only to have Matthew get killed in a car wreck shortly after his son's birth. My point is that Downton Abbey seemed to lose much of its joy during season 3.<br /><br />I hope season 4 will bring back some glimmer of joy to Downton Abbey.
B005CRQ3NY|3.0|The book is awesome. The only dog was sweetie.Greg needs to toughen up.over all this was a really good book .and you guys should read it.and Greg you suck
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I really enjoyed reading Canada.  Though it was fiction the story was  believable.  It was great to see the main character rise above his disfunctional childhood and become a successfull citizen in society.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|not only is this game accurate to touch, the 3D aspect is amazing! I can't put this down! kudos to the creators for taking your average matching tiles game to a new level!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|great movie the 3d was awesome an love the hulks attitude in this one great cast story an graphics a good buy
B006LSZECO|4.0|I did not care for the plot of this book - BUT, It certainly was a page turner!  Did not particularly care for any of the characters and yet I stayed up late reading night after night just to find out what would happen next. It was a very intense read.  Some members of our book club thought there would be a sequel because of - wait! I'm not giving it away.  You'll have to read it!
B007XF0X6G|5.0|great movie like the 3d wish they would have did more with the story but I still liked it part of my collection so definitely a good buy
B004I744AS|5.0|It's helps me so much with school. Whenever I need to do vocabulary in English I wipe my kindle out and use this app. It's helpful in many ways. I would get it
B0069UP2PI|5.0|I bought a used DVD.  They called the quality &#34;Good&#34;.  It looks perfect to me.  . . . .. .
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I thought this film was funny.  What more can I say?  I'm just trying to come up with the required amount of words.  I think that does it.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Being from the Bay Area, I was somewhat familiar with the story of Billy Beane. But the behind the scenes strategy was a well kept secret. This book explains a lot not only about the A's but about MLB as well.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had heard alot about the game Angry Birds, but I did not know anything about the game.  I think it is funny, frustrating at times, very entertaining.
B002WY65VU|5.0|my boyfriend loved this movie! it was brand new still in the plastic wrapping! i woukd recommend this to anyone
B000FC10WU|4.0|This was the first Agatha Christie book that I have read.  I bought the book, because I have heard alot about Agatha Christie.  The book has humoe and twist that keeps you guessing.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Can't seem to put it down.<br />Finally a game you don't have to pay to get to the next level!
B006X5L6VS|2.0|I've seen this on an Android, and it was great.  But this Night Sky didn't work on the Kendal Fire like what I saw on my friend's Android.
B007TK77QE|5.0|JK has made the transition from &#34;children's writer&#34; to adult fiction with great ease.<br /><br />Absolutely fabulous storyline with real characters that one could relate to very well.  Could not put it down.<br /><br />Can't wait until her next one.
B008133JZG|5.0|Very few television series' are able to improve in their second season, especially ones that had such a great debut, but the second season of Sherlock tops the extraordinary work in the first one in every category. The rapport between Sherlock and Watson is strengthened, and the two play off of each other quite well. The humor in the second season has been upped considerably, but it doesn't take away from the drama of the show. Furthermore, the nice twist of replacing the first person narrative by Watson in the books with the idea that Watson has a blog on the show was a great addition. The homage to the deer-stalker cap was also a nice touch.<br /><br />After the big reveal of Moriarty at the end of the first season, the second season of Sherlock adapts the three most popular stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. We get to meet Irene Adler, we get to undercover the hound from Baskervilles, and we get to see the final confrontation between Sherlock and his nemesis Moriarty. All three episodes are incredibly well put together and as close to perfection as you can get.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I have seen the movies but thought I should read the books because I knew how much more was told in the books.  I was so pleased with this book.  It goes into a lot more detail than the movie. Explaining things in so much more detail.  To me if you have seen the movies you have to the books.
B000T46O52|4.0|This is a great film! I can't believe that it has been almost 20 years since it was made. It is almost an era-piece now. There are no car crashes nor shooting of guns. So, if you are into to that mindlessness, stay away. My only complaint is with Amazon's service. The film was stopped 5 times for rebuffering. I don't get that with Netflix or Vudu.
1932735410|5.0|Well!I usually fall asleep after reading a few pages of any book but this one was certinaly different. And it keeps you focussed on passing the examination ...<br /><br />Read this book twice (or more if you are still not confident)....and glance through the PMBOK v4 once. I didn't read any other books/materials/blogs etc.
B003B02O7I|5.0|I have enjoyed many of his books over the years, but this one was special because of how he wove the Gospel into the storyline.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|if you watched the TV Series &#34;Star Blazers&#34; on American TV in the 1970's/80's then this is the movie for you. It is a combination of a ww2 battleship and Starwars. The Yamato was the flagship of the Japanese fleet in ww2. It also was sunk by the Americans in an epic battle. So in this movie the sunken ship is rebuilt into a space ship with a giant wave motion gun installed in the front. It seems like something kids would make up while playing on a dirt mound in their back yard. In fact after watching the animation series my friends and I all glued jet engines on our battle ship models and flew them around the yard. We use to do this thing call play, where we would do what ever we felt like until we got tired and went in to eat bowls of cereal. We usually felt like running in random patterns around the back yard or pushing little cars around while laying on the ground making motor noises with our mouths.<br /><br />oh yea, the movie ... I really don't care if you like it or not it was cool to see the ship for me... but there was too much dialog and not enough space battles ...
0525952926|5.0|Loved this book. I &#34;read&#34; Book 1 on CDs going back and forth to work. I enjoyed the history perspective in a 'novel' setting. Following the families from Book 1 into Book 2 gave WW2 history a more personal feel. This is Ken Follett at his best. Even if you are not a history buff you can enjoy this read. It is not necessary to read Book 1 first but why would you not?
B005S9EKCW|1.0|Terrible \\"stagey\\" movie. Terrible singing except in a few performances. Taking this from stage to screen did nothing to enhance it. Oh and Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter are the worst in this. It's like they are filming a different campy comedy while everyone around them is so very very dour. I wish I could unsee this.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I just saw the film last week, but I decided that the nature of the story would have to be an even better book. I was not at all disappointed!  Enough of the screenplay was from the book that the characters felt familiar, but the book was different enough to seem like a completely different story. The movie  changed and left out details but was still a really touching story.  The book stayed within Pat`s head but still made you care about each character in spite of their flaws.  A really well done book and a really well done screenplay!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I would not really call myself a Bond aficionado.  I have seen all three of the movies Daniel Craig has starred in, and a few of the others.  Like any Bond movie this one has a lot of action.  Of the three recent movies, I think this one has the best opening sequence.  Javier Bardem as Siva was definitely the best villain in the recent films.  He plays cunning, creepy and sadistic all at the same time.  Like all Bond movies you pretty much have to suspend your disbelief and accept that he is going to be indestructible.  I won't spoil the opening for those who have not seen the movie, but the chances of anyone surviving what Bond does, and as well as he does is slim to none.<br /><br />Overall I think the movie has a great blend of action, suspense and even comedic moments.  If you are a fan of the Bond franchise, or just like action movies, this is definitely entertaining.  It is a little long (checking in at just under 2.5 hrs), but I did not ever have a point when I was wondering when it was going to end.  It flows well enough that you do not even notice how long it is.
B00A6TYCNQ|1.0|I NEVER write a review on a game that I haven't played, but I have a hard time understanding why a new game for Kindle Tablets would not be compatible with one of the newest tablets.  Cant use on my Kindle Fire HD7?
B008458O3S|5.0|Awesome game, one of the better P u axle Apps out there. I have actually referred family members ask me where I got it. Thanks so much.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Fun at all levels, the whole family enjoys these jiggly critters.  Good practice for problem solving.  Nice graphics as well.
B009EEFTMC|1.0|I fail to recognize what everyone else finds so wonderful about this game. It's been done a million times before, the tiles are not attractive, there is no variation to the game or pretty music. You just match the same garishly colored cubes over and over and over. Made me want to take a nap.
B00BF8OYJO|1.0|If you're suffering from withdrawal symptoms because you haven't had anything new involving Agatha Raisin then maybe you might want to read this.  If you've never read anything Agatha Raisin then I would steer clear of it and go for one of the full length books.<br /><br />I was disappointed by this very short story as there is very little substance to it and a few too many grammatical mistakes.  Agatha herself only makes a brief appearance. I read it last night and I now can't remember anything about it - lunch time the following day.  M C Beaton's publishers are not doing her reputation any favours by publishing this story in my opinion.
0142418471|5.0|This was a great novel. It was hilarious and it was heartfelt. Just what I expected from John Green.<br />I loved it!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have so much fun playing this game on my kindle.  I just seem to lose track of time.  Very addictive.  Highly recommendable.
0374533571|5.0|I loved this book. I finished it in less than a day. The characters are so real.<br />It was like an adult The Perks of Being a Wallflower.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I purchased this program to use on my Kindle Fire HD, it does a beautiful job downloading u-tube files, the sound and video are great. HOWEVER it does not allow you to create a play list or categorize your files. When I tried it a message box appeared, (Play list requires 'Meridian Player', Do you want to install it? After reading about Meridian Player and customer reviews, I am not sure that I want to download it.
B00014NE62|5.0|There are few movies of any genre that can hold my attention for 2 hours and 20 minutes, but this masterpiece of cinema is the epitome of everything I look for in a gay-themed film.  Here you find love, romance, self-denial, fear of social repercussions, beautiful young men in love, a few splashes of non-gratuitous frontal nudity, and a happy ending attesting to the power of love triumphing over all odds.  A brilliant British cast combined with a flawless story and resplendent cinematography and sound quality all contribute to the amazing impact this movie has had on me. I would describe this film as sort of a gay Downton Abbey with all the brilliance of the BBC Masterpiece Classic itself. See it, embrace it, add it to your most cherished collection of gay-themed films.<br /><br />For those who haven't yet seen many gay themed films or are starting a gay film library, I would like share a list of some of my own personal favorite and most highly recommended gay-themed films to date:<br /><br /> 1. Shelter(Trevor Wright, Brad Rowe) 2. Beautiful Thing (Glen Berry, Scott Neal)<br /><br /> 3. House of Boys (Layke Anderson, Benn Northover) 4. Latter Days (Steve Sandvoss, Wes Ramsey) 5. Maurice (James Wilby, Hugh Grant)<br /><br /> 6. Big Eden (Arye Gross, Tim DeKay) 7. The Trip (Larry Sullivan, Steve Braun) 8. Boys in the Band (Kenneth Nelson, Leonard Frey)<br /><br /> 9. Unconditional Love (Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett)  10. Mambo Italiano (Luke Perry, Paul Sorvino)<br /><br />11. Making Love (Kate Jackson, Michael Ontkean)  12. Brokeback Mountain (Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaaal)<br /><br />13. The Sum of Us (Russell Crowe, Jack Thompson)  14. Undertow (Christian Mercado, Manolo Cardona)<br /><br />15.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|Excellent DVD.  We enjoyed and will watch again and again.  It is well done and enjoyable to watch this DVD
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this was a fun game. it was like you were really there! couldn't. put it down...on the search for another bigfish game.
1451695195|5.0|Dr Alexander's experience is quite remarkable and different from the other NDES I have heard or read about.  I have given it to several members of our family  and reading this book has confirmed our beliefs in the future.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|The story is not believeable and the conclusions are forced. It makes a fast read not because it's a thrilling page turner but because some of it makes for painful reading and you are flipping through it hoping that it will end soon.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Clint really played this part well. I loved how he made a big turn around from hating a race from the Korean war to befriending his korean neighbors.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I really like this format and all the information that has been included.  It would be helpful to me to have a definition of symbols or directions to them.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Une édition techniquement correcte pour un grand classique romantique magnifiant les grands espaces africains  : il y avait logtemps que j'espérais une édition en blu-ray de cette oeuvre cinématographique ...
B0084HJE0S|5.0|Quick, to-the-point introduction to existing and upcoming features for Javascript and HTML5. It provides a glimpse into the future of browser and mobile javascript applications. A great read before venturing into coding interactive web apps.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This album is the best I've heard in the past year and I am not sure I've ever heard something so unique. I'm already itching for the next album.
B008DL466C|5.0|Wiz Khalifa is one of the next big artists to make it big. I love this album and would recommend it to everyone that likes good music :)
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|I love the book.  Ken Follet seems to never disappoint.  Even though it is fictional, it connects with actual historical facts and you have to keep reminding yourself that you are actually reading fiction.
0679805273|5.0|I got inspired to collect my daughter's (5 and 7) teachers signatures in these and want to give them these books when they graduate from High School. It is a beautiful story. But what else do we expect from a Dr. Seuss book? We have almost all of them. What a genius he was.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Nice and fun<br />Very good search and find game so far for me. I hope to see more like this one.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|I saw the first episode with my husband, and honestly we weren't that impressed. I got this DVD due to all the great reviews, but I would not buy this again. I will try to watch this and hope I will get into it. I am a huge Castle fan, so I thought I'd get this since the reviews were so good and since I like Nathan Fillion. So far unfortunately not that impressed.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 2 was packaged nice and it arrived a day ahead of it's scheduled due date. Very happy with purchase
0345803485|2.0|I am on page 128 and I am bored. I was so excited about reading this book after I saw the reviews and it was highly recommended to me. This is my first 'naughty' book (how I like to call it) and I am still waiting for something to happen. I am a little upset I bought the trilogy, but I am hoping to get into this at some point. And I agree with other reviews that state they are annoyed how Ana is always saying that she doesn't think she is pretty / he is so gorgeous  how can he be interested in me..... Wow, that is almost on every other page. I will try to get through these because I already spend the money. I can only hope it is getting better.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this show.  I can't wait for Season 4 to begin and hope that it's soon.  The package arrived on the day it was suppose to and packaged very well.
1577312082|3.0|My native language is german, but I have lived in the US for almost 14 years now. I am a super busy Mom and I bought this as it was recommended to me. I saw the reviews and was super excited to listen to this. However, it is a little hard for me to follow. Not sure if I have a problem concentrating on it since my mind seems to be always going, or if it is the language..... I will try again though, since I would really like to get into it. But after I listen for 5 minutes the first time I was done..... (I listened to it at night to calm down before sleeping and it worked in the regards that I fell asleep within minutes.)
B00A50PDDY|5.0|This album has really changed my life. Tyler Joseph's lyrics and his vocals are just incredible. And Josh Dun's drumming intertwined with Tyler's piano and ukelele are just amazing. I don't even know their genre because they're so different and original. Holding on to you has to be everyone's favorite, along with Car Radio, Guns for hands, Migraine and Screen. They also have some electronic songs which I feel add a unique sound with the drumming. Purchase this and you will listen to your new favorite band. They are also amazing live! If you ever have a chance to see them, do so. They put on a really good show and it was unlike any other show!<br />So, if you want to listen to some fresh new music, get this album and have your life changed as well.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|I got this movie and the Firefly series since the review were soooo good. My husband is a huge Si-Fi fan and so I thought since I am a Castle (Nathan Fillion) fan I'd get this for some together time on the couch. We watched the first episode of Firefly and weren't impressed in all. That's why I have not watched Serenity yet. I will try to get into it when I have more time. But right now I rather watch Castle when I have a moment to watch TV than this.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Although there are some &#34;bad&#34; words on this CD, and I found myself saying, &#34;Oh, Bruno!  What were you thinking!&#34;, I still loved the entire CD...a little short with only 10 songs and I found myself singing all over to the first song very quickly.  The CD has great rhythms from Bruno (all songs written by him), and I can picture his smooth moves to each one.  Highly recommended.  I can hardly wait for his next CD!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is my list of the best games ever I love the graphics of the game because I love horses mostly but still this game is wicked
B002KT3XH6|5.0|Fascinating book with a deep level of well researched facts. Enjoyed every page. Recommend reading it. Couldn't put it down!
B00322PKBW|3.0|I like the watch. But it is not a men' s watch.I bought it for my husband and had to keep it for me. It is too small for a men's wrist.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a real fun game. Its fun for 5 year old to around 35. You should really get this app.
B009MCRHH6|2.0|I do not have the patience to keep trying and trying to build something with the ebb and flow of oil.  I still have it on my device, but have considered dumping it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the game is pretty fun. more detailed than the first. the mine section was really cool. it upheld its expectations!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Best movie I have ever seen.  Denzel Washington is the finest actor and everyone I talk to agrees - the very best<br />of performance.  Thank you for sharing your talen..........t and this movie is above some others nominated  Glad I did not<br />miss it.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|It is a great tale,perhaps historical, i`ll have to go o computer to decipher it!!!!Maximus the great!More words is tooo much folderal!11111
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This app works great with my wireless HP printer. I can print from my phone or tablet now. . .
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|I downloaded the game and loved it. I was glued to my kindle and the graphics where amazing. I was on the great white shark and loving it when it started me over. I tried again and got to the hammerhead when it started me over again. I deleted the app because I was very sad. :(
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game for kids or adults that are kids at heart. I hope they add more to the game soon.
B00979CS50|5.0|I bought this for my husband as a Christmas present.  He loves Neil Young's music and had been looking for this.  Thank you!
B002G01EPC|5.0|It is very flexiable with allows you to play without fear of it breaking apart.  The only negative is that the cape is hard to put on.
0345529057|5.0|Arrived as promised, great books, excellent story, great price. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a good fantasy book.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun and pretty but difficult to get the more awesome extras without real cash for gems and coins. Limited in that manner.
B00138JBMG|4.0|Only reason why i purchased this is because of Jake E. Lee.  Ozzys vocals are pretty lame on this album but the guitar work is great.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|for an overall high score i got 210,365. in one run i got 1,044.  ALL THAT GOT DELETED. i had $107,859<br />in the game and all of a sudden i have $0 and my high score is 0000 . it would have been a great game. its pretty fun and all. iwas enjoying it until that happened.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|THE GUILT TRIP is a film made for people who enjoy warm, poignant comedies, the kind that have lost their way amidst very funny, but very raunchy, in-your-face movies like BRIDEMAIDS.  This is not that kind of comedy at all.  The humor is gentle and there is a message!!  I enjoy both ends of the spectrum--BRIDEMAIDS is hilarious. THE GUILT TRIP is also very funny, but I am sure that most teenagers would not get a kick out of seeing Streisand and Rogen banter back and forth. So maybe this film is for the middle aged crowd? Well, so be it.  My wife and I laughed out loud with the rest of the audience and we sniffled a bit when things got rough for the two characters. Rogen's character has a lot to learn about being a son--much more than his mother does.  She can be annoying, but he can be spiteful.  I saw my mother in Streisand's Joyce (and we are not Jewish--Joyce is not a typical \\"Jewish\\" mother--that is offensive! My mother is also on a fixed income, and she uses coupons, and she calls to see how I am if I have not called her in a while).  Joyce is a mother, a woman, whose son lives across the country, and whose husband left decades ago.  Her son needs to learn to respect his mother just because she is his mother. All sons need to learn this!  Buy this film and watch it with Mom. ENJOY!
B008NW67E0|5.0|It is a rare thing when you buy an album (CD) and you like every song on the album.I can say this for Babel! Every song a gem.
B000TU16GS|5.0|I loved this book. It was very interesting, probably not for younger kids<br />, though. It gets you to want to read it more.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Cubistry is a matching game and as its name and picture denotes, it is in cube form. The game is fun to me. I have no complaints. It asked did I want to post my scores but I didn't have to. I like that it gave me an option. I also like that the game has a pause button as well.<br /><br />All in all it's a neat concept and a great game.
0316228532|5.0|I was able to get this book at an excellent price.  It's not a book that I will keep forever, so cost was important.  I will probably give it to a friend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I downloaded this app originally for my five year old who is into horses. Well Beauty just grew on all of us i think! The whole family enjoys watching and participating in the competitions and my kids are learning how to work to earn money and the importance of saving money to buy the things you really want. Great game that we would recommend to everyone!
0143122010|5.0|I have been trying to understand what's happening in our world, what root causes are, and how we can make our world a safer place. Pinker provides an excellent model based on much research. Very enlightening. 700 pages was rather a daunting read, but the reader can skip sections and still reach the conclusions Pinker has skillfully laid out. Not an easy read, but a mind-changing book to help us begin the conversations needed to bring about change.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Saw this movie in theaters w/ my daughter, & we both loved it. Was thrilled to see that Amazon had it for only $10 just a couple weeks after it was released to DVD.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Another super hero story. Sorry I saw Tom Cruise play Reacher recently. Reacher, 6'5&#34; 250#  Cruise 5'6&#34; is not Reacher.....<br />Mr Child brings Reacher to life for me.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This works well considering the size and the cost. I can obvioulsy get a better edge with stones but as a portable device it works great. Comes in handy when out and have sharpened a knife in the field after hacking away on several tasks and it quickly put a decent edge on the knife.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Interesting story plot with a lot of twists and turns.  Very good FX scenes and looking forward to the next one.
B00846F1YW|4.0|The story is cheesy, but finding the items and placing tiles is fun and challenging.  Definitely worth it! I like it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really enjoy this coin game. I find my self getting anxious as I approach the next level. Lots of fun.
B000PKG7I4|3.0|I enjoy listening to Amy but, this early music of hers is more eclectic and, not so much the jazzy style she became known for.
0062238868|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, Mr. Kyle writes the story keeping your interest in what he experienced, he will be missed.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is fun, simple and a great stress reliever.  Even an old lady like me can have a blast slashing fruit!
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|I love movie scores, and I am also a huge Lord of the Rings fan. Naturally, this soundtrack was a must-buy. I have been nothing but pleased! The dwarf songs are well-executed, and they even include the full version of the Misty Mountains song in this special edition. I would recommend this to anyone who likes soundtracks or loves Lord of the Rings!
6305882592|5.0|Just one of those movies that seem to pass through time, and somehow everyone gets it and relates to something in their life.  Did not realize how hard it was to find, till I decided to buy it for someone's birthday.  I am glad it was available, also makes you wonder how many movies are out there that did not make it through some critic, and was shelved for time.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I have only recently heard music from the Lumineers, but I listen all the time now.  It is now one of my favorite albums.
B0019IB26I|4.0|A man with so much of a talent lays his soul out for the public to hear.  If a tree is dying in the forest, and no one is there to hear it, does it make a noise?  Yes, I am glad to hear such raw talent as he blows through riffs.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|No, this isn't traditional Mahjong, but I have to say that I like it a whole lot better!  There is a challenge to this that there isn't to the flat playing field of traditional Mahjong.  There is more memory involved and I like that too.  Great game!  Look at the screen-shots to see what you are getting yourself in for, that's why they are there.  Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS F#!&_n Awesome the graphics are great and i love that if u connect to facebook you can compete with ur freinds
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. It is by far my favorite book. EVER. The writing was unique and just special. The storyline was incredibly creative and descriptive and kept me reading.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A very well-paced narrative about the Navy Seal mission that resulted in the eradication of Osama bin Ladin. Mark Owen gives his readers a comprehensive account of the rigorous training and devotion to duty that the Seals traditionally employ. It is highly recommended reading for every patriotic American.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|So I hadn't heard of Imagine Dragons until a colleague mentioned that they would be playing for our company party.  I was a bit skeptical, but they were totally awesome live.  After that concert, I just had to buy their CD.  They sound just like they did in concert.  Its totally worth the few bucks.  The whole CD is great!
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie is very epic. I think the &#34;critics&#34; are crazy for not liking it. It's gorgeous, exciting, and has very good looking lead characters:) Sci-fi fans MUST watch John Carter. I'm estatic that Disney bought Lucasfilms so they can make new Star Wars films!
B001G70M6S|5.0|I suspect there are only a few people who might be interested in shooting in a process whose hey day has come and likely gone. My own camera is over 50 years hold and held together with a prayer and a hope each time I press that shutter release.<br /><br />But you should feel comfortable about shooting with this film.it gives a warm range of grays that provide that magic found in early polaroid pics, in a very easy to substitute format. You will enjoy the use of red and yellow filters to help you bring those wispy clouds into the picture, or the cold drab black and white of colorless skies inked in with black tree limbs or dark house outlines.<br /><br />Thanks to fugitive for giving us a few more years with this fun to use and enjoy format. Try it out, you'll like it, as you will the color version of this film.
145210655X|5.0|I bought this for my husband as a gift since he's a sci-fi fan. Plus then I get to enjoy it. It's a very fun mini comic book. I think there's over 60 pages, but when it was over I wished there was more (because it's that awesome). Afterwards, I wished there was a version with Princess Leia. Well now I'm getting my wish because it's coming out in a couple months:) Awesome book! Buy it!
B004P2HMNM|5.0|Once again Lego has designed another beautiful modular set.  I'm not sure I can add any details at this point that haven't already been covered by previous reviews.<br /><br />The set was very fun to build. It is two separate structures that combine to make one large building. I was able to complete one side of the set at one sitting and another a day or two later. If you have kids that blow through the building phase of their Lego's then this set will certainly occupy some of their time, as will all the modulars. Although it is marketed as a 16+ set there was nothing difficult about it. Of course I am 40 years old and have been building Lego since 1978.Honestly though my daughter who is 6 helped me with quite a bit of this set and I am sure she could accomplish the build on her own if she tried.<br /><br />The finished product looks fantastic, especially if you combine it with the other modular sets Lego has released. Beware these Lego Modular sets are addicting and if you get one you will most likely want them all.<br /><br />I give the Lego Pet Shop two thumbs way up, 10/10, 5 Stars all the way.
B00004T1C8|5.0|My 2.5 year old son has mostly Thomas the Train sets but this tunnel is awesome. It fits just fine with his tracks. Not all the trains trigger the sounds by going through the tunnel but there's a yellow button on top that triggers the sounds also. I really like all the tunnel sounds (especially the owl). Even when another 2 year old came over, he quickly discovered the sound button all on his own. Great tunnel! I'm glad I purchased it.
0451196716|2.0|The book would have been much better with a bit more character development and a better ending. I never felt vested in any of the characters, and I wasn't sad to see them shot. The whole book was a long walk for me - just there and reading it for the sake of it. I had hoped for a great twist in the ending, but like my walks around the block, it just ended. There as nothing clever or scary about this book. For a King book, it was a big disappointment, and I'm sorry I payed almost 8 bucks for the Kindle version.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can play this game whenever I want. It is so fun! I hope everybody can enjoy this app. Absolutely fantastic!!!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Downloading electronic books is quick and easy.  Buyer beware: this is an adult book.  Some material is inappropriate for young readers.

B00AFROVQC|4.0|As others have already mentioned, this is nice, feel-good story, definitely geared towards a younger audience.  While some seem to be quick (too quick) to compare it to the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, I'd caution against expecting something similar to those two when you read this book.  While the first HP book was clearly skewed towards a younger audience, it was also clearly written with a slightly older audience anticipated. (Similar to Pixar movies - designed for kids, designed not to drive parents crazy.)  This book, on the other hand, just doesn't have the kind of content that spans generations.  There seems to be very little depth or back-story for any of the characters (although, you do learn more about the main character's history in later books,) and whenever it's convenient, anything can be resolved by a little magic, or a little \\"random act of kindness/strength/act of God.\\"  (The comparison to LotR is, well, silly.  They are both collections of written word.  That's where the similarities end.)<br /><br />Now before you leave this review scratching your head about why I gave it 4 stars...well...for what it is, it's VERY entertaining.  If reading \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" is like getting a doctorate in neuro-surgery, reading the Sorcerer's Ring is kind of like playing Oregon Trail on the computer in 5th grade.  Every once in a while, it's just nice to sit down and read a book that doesn't require a 500 page companion glossary of names, dates, and topography.  It would be very simple to sit at a computer and bash this book because it only contains 5 words with more than 3 syllables, (that obviously isn't true, but it makes my point nicely,) but it's much more fun to just realize that this is a feel-good book that isn't designed to tax your mind, but rather to simply entertain.<br /><br />**Spoilers**<br />Random thoughts:<br />Like others, I think it's a bit shaky how quickly Thor becomes \\"like one of the king's sons\\".  In other books, The Wheel of Time for example, it takes the main character roughly 240000 pages before he is respected by his own friends, let alone the co-most powerful king in all the realm.  There are also plenty of grammatical errors (at least in the Kindle version) to momentarily pull you out of the story.  (e.g. Either the author or the editor really needs to look into the differences between \\"site\\" and \\"sight\\" and \\"there\\" and \\"their\\".)  But again, minor problems that can be fixed by simply moving on.<br /><br />A good, fun, quick read.  For those used to reading books that are full of textual booby-traps, side-stories, and random POV, this will be a piece of cake.  I'd allot a couple of evenings for each book, maybe three if you take your time.

B00AEQYM6S|4.0|Herr Kaufmann's rise to fame is relatively slow. While lyrical tenors could make a fame for himself as early as in his mid-twenties, Herr Kaufmann waited well until his late-thirties. Some attributed his `delay' of rise to fame to his early erroneous outing as a light lyrical tenor early in his career.<br />Apparently Kaufmann's earlier career displayed an erratic approach to operatic singing, as evident in the numerous clips on Youtube in those formative years of his.<br />That said, the heavier romantic and light dramatic repertoire are really Kaufmann's calling cards. He has proved himself a top-notch interpretor of Italian verismo roles, to the astonishment of all opera lovers. That leads one immediately to the next step that this amazing singer will take - the German heldentenor roles.<br />I for one disagree that Kaufmann is a heldentenor. He is a spinto tenor, for sure, but not a heldentenor, if one measures heldentenors by the yardstick of a Lauritz Melchior, or even Jon Vickers. Kaufmann's heft is not really heldentenor-like, as amply demonstrated by the opening Scene from Die Walkure. Indeed, here, Kaufmann's voice sits least comfortably in the `Ring Cycle' pieces. It is in the Rienzi, Tanhausser and Lohengrin excerpts that his true colour is being shown to the best advantage. I have some reservation for his `Am stillen Herd', though. The piece can be effectively tackled by employing a freer tone with more bel canto-like technique, allowing more room for tenore overtones, though Kaufmann's rendition is not deficient in the strict sense.<br />This is not to say that Kaufmann is not a Wagnerian tenor. His rendition of the 5 Wesendonck-Lieder really opens up ears for the more lyrical Wagnerian style: he has the colour, the heft, the enunciation for these pieces, though admittedly, the range of the pieces lie a tad too low for Kaufmann.
0425264386|5.0|On of the best books i've ever read. Lee Child in his best moments, grasps the reader from the hair and holds him till the last page.<br />I would surely recommend this book to all the fans of the kind and not only.<br /><br />You won't be able to leave the book till it's finished!!!
B005MWK9JS|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie to it's fullist. I can't wait to see what comes after this one. The quality was supreme without a doubt. I will continue doing business with Amazon. Thanks a whole lot Amazon.
0515153656|5.0|Every time i get a Lee Child book in my hands i wonder why this guy doesn't write a book every month! I start reading it and i know that when it's finished i'll have to wait at least for another six or eight months for the next to come!<br />You'll certainly think it's absurd, however this is the truth.<br />Child never fails you, you know what you're getting but still he manages to keep you guessing about the outcome till the last minute.<br />Awesome book, i think the best book he's ever written. And i've read them all!

B005KELW26|5.0|Product is what it says. Keeps my kindle clean and secure. love the color. Kindile fits perfect and does not slid at all.
B008NEVP1S|4.0|Swimming in intellectual involution can be as tricky as the interlude on Henry James in The Parallax View (2006) by Slavoj Zizek. My reviews have been far too open on what rock and roll is all about. The songs of Aimee Mann have a quality that was captured by Zizek in a quotation of Henry James from The Wings of a Dove:<br /><br />It had come to the point really<br />that they showed each other pale faces,<br />and that all the unspoken between them<br />looked out of their eyes in the dim terror<br />of their further conflict.<br /><br />When I listen to Aimee Mann's Charmer CD, I can hear her telling me:<br /><br />Don't call me, you should call your daughter again.<br /><br />Zizek sees two times two couples in The Golden Bowl; a father and daughter and the \\"unofficial\\" couple they married which reignites an old passion. The novel has set up a utopian prospect of an incestuous couple and a licentious couple accepting their illicit passions, but the bowl is a Hitchcockian object that is the focus of intense libidinal investments. For Zizek, the bowl is \\"all of a piece, beautifully gilded with American money, but beneath this appearance are deep cracks.\\"
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I have downloaded full episodes of my favorite show. it works wonderfully! get this, before you go off buying and WASTING your money on videos you could be getting for free!$$$ I could not express my enthusiasm anymore for this! great job Devian Studio!
B001NFNFF8|5.0|The loving, gentle wisdom spoken by the Confederate General comforts a tormented Robicheaux. If one can suspend one's disbelief, illusion blends with reality.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|This was insanely easy to install after learning how to place a processor. I haven't had any problems at all with this chip.<br /><br />While reading the manual for my new motherboard, I figured all the complicated stuff in there (the tweaking) would fall on me to do. So I read up on it and learned and thought I would have to do something at least mildly complicated and new to get the board working with the processor. But no, it booted on the first attempt, right into the OS and began its updates.<br /><br />I've paired this with a 1gb asus GPU at ddr5 (i think it's the fx 550) and the video is quality, the processor fan's smart controls needed to be tweaked in the end by, I think, 500rpms (a reading of 36), but I'm not sure if that was my board. Anyway, it plays games at it's stock 3.3 just fine without needing overclocked, and at temps between 35c and 45c. It idles between 19 and 22, not under graphical strain....all temp readings from my mid tower corsair case, if that matters lol.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Don't get me wrong, it's a great app! I use it for my school notebooks. Just wish you could highlight the notes also. If u can, I must have missed it. Otherwise, it's amazing!
B009GEAPYW|4.0|pros: -Voice acting is good this batman sounds like a weathered old war veteran which in a sense is all too true a<br />  -animation is a unique smooth style that looks good<br />  -action sequences blend realistic/gritty urban terrorist situations with DC/comic book action to bring a unique spin on the usually predictable superhero genre<br />  -pacing is good enough so that you crave watching part II ASAP!<br /><br />cons: news commentary seem very lifeless and drawn out<br />  some plot threads seem introduced then cast off in seconds<br />  some inner monologue missing from batman as we'd like to see what he thinks from time to time of whats going on around him<br /><br />All in all i'd say an 8.5/10 very well done and action packed for 1/2 a movie
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|incredible show.. the writing is deep and thoughtful, visually stunning, i would highly recomend this show, i grew up watching horror movies, this is a masterpiece
B00B7FXYJG|3.0|All I can say is that it appears as though Batsie has lost his mind.  This is probably what would actually happen to batman mentally if he retired versus getting killed.
0385335997|5.0|I have read other books in the Outlander series and this book offers a good deal of history as well as adventure and romance.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is a very fun game.  Wish I had more friends or family to play with.  Evidently, it is only for Kindle users.
1616550414|5.0|I have been a huge zelda fan since ocarina of time.  I have always been interested in the zelda universe, especially its fictional history.  Love this book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love these books, this one is great just like the other two!! This book is amazing!! I love it:) I have read the whole series 4:)
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My wife is English and her friends from home told her of Downton Abbey toward the end of  season one.  She wanted the DVD set and reviews suggested buying the UK version over the PBS stating that the PBS version is edited from the original.  We have since purchased the UK versions of Downton Abbey seasons 1, 2, and 3 and we both love the series.  Since season 3 was released a couple of weeks ago, we have only had an opportunity to view the first three episodes of season 3.  The acting and writing, so far, are on a pace to equal the two previous seasons.  If you haven't seen Downton Abbey you are missing out on quality TV at it's best.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its really awesome I really like it you should really get this game I really do like it so. Please get it do you will be happy
0451169514|5.0|If you like Stephen King whats not to like about this book. It was a good price and arrived right on time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. The only thing i have against it is that its got to many freezin spots in it and i hate that
143911000X|4.0|I love this show, and I dont care if it's a book 'made for men' it just helps remind me why I think the show is so great.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|The plot revolves through a woman's investigative reporting of the Vel'd'Hiv roundup of Jews in Paris in 1942. It shows the dichotomy of the French citizens who helped and saved young lives during the brutality of the roundup, and simultaneously the French armed men's bureaucracy. The book is narrated as the events unfold in present day France and the reporter's relentless pursuit of the life of a young girl who survived the round up. The journalist itself is an American who is married to a Frenchman with a level headed teenage daughter. Simple reading and yet powerful glimpses into the past.
B004G600A4|4.0|I love Disney and everything they make. Even though this isn't such a classic its made in such a good way! It's a must have for everyone!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I really liked it over all. It is really good and the houses are very realistic. Bravo. Keep up the good work
B001NLKT60|5.0|The book is well written and is mostly a page turner, especially at the end. There are small sections where alot of information is given, so it can be a little slow, but the information is important to the story.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|VERY well constructed nice and easy to use. Can read horizontally or vertically without interruption. Love how it has the elastic to secure the cover closed.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is one of the best Drama Period Pieces I have ever seen! I love that it is a a continued series! It leaves you wanting at the end of each episode!I  CANNOT WAIT until the next Season! And Violet oh my is my favorite Character!!!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Ive played several HO games. this one is clearly the best! Well worth the few dollars I paid. Will definitely play again!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|this game was ok. but you get stuck after you get the lions and the elephants into the zoo. you have no idea what to do next.
B0076DELIG|2.0|I got so used to Harry Bosch being just an action man and every now and then getting involved with a female character.  This book lacked that.  It showed Bosch as a father and as a jazz music lover, which personally I really don't care for.  His relationship and guilt for not being able to spend time with his daughter had become a bit tiresome I was actually skipping those parts.  His description of what music he listened to was even worse.  Not being a fan of jazz, I had no idea who the artists he was talking about were, nor am I interested in finding out.  This book is unrealistic compare to the other Bosch stories.  Especially the part where he went away on personal vacation to pursue a case and then feeling guilty for not being able to spend time with his daughter.  And the female detective that followed him during his supposed vacation, that was even more unrealistic.  I almost felt like with this book, Michael Connelly was starting to run out of ideas.  The angle about the Desert Storm crime was actually good, it just didn't develop into something more interesting to read as far as the plot was concerned.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Simply incredible. Did not see the ending that came, coming at all. Think I may read again to see if I notice clues. Simply a great read. Can't wait to see what they've done with the movie.wow!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow Sylvia Day books are great.  When I read this book I could not wait for another one.  Great author
B007REV4YI|3.0|I generally prefer buying my movies on iTunes as I believe discs are a thing of the past and this is yet another example as to why I'd have been better off.<br />I figured for the same price, I'd buy the Blu-Ray (which is High Definition) since they now include a 'Digital Copy', which essentially is the movie for your iTunes library.<br />So if I'm paying for the high definition movie, why would they give me a standard definition iTunes copy? I would have been better off spending $4 LESS and buying it directly in iTunes, where the quality would have been true 1080p HD. This digital copy is hardly 720p (closer to 480p). I'm really annoyed and quite frankly would like to return the disc for a refund so that I can get the digital HD version I wanted all along.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|Love their sound and it is just a joy to listen to any of their music.  Love the group and glad they are doing so well
B008HK3XOU|4.0|This is indeed lightweight, and protective of my new Kindle Fire.  I especially like the standing feature when watching videos.  The only negative is that it is very inconvenient when charging.  But it's not inconvenient enough to make me dislike it, or cause me to discourage someone else from purchasing it.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Loved this movie  All of my friends plus daughter kept talking about this movie.  Glad I got it and enjoed Tatum
B000002LK1|5.0|Simply put, DMode hit gold in 1990. This album is so gorgeously crafted, from beginning to end. Crafted with perfect precision, Violator switches things up to avoid repetition of songs, opened by an ever-growing somber \\"World Through My Eyes\\", followed by the Gore lead \\"Sweatiest Perfection\\". Of course, the song after, Personal Jesus, REALLY switches it up; it's guitar lead! With a beautiful ballad in \\"Waiting for the Night\\" and equal beauty in the restlessness pulse of the smash hit \\"Enjoy the Silence\\", the album only flattens a bit with the Gore-lead \\"Blue Dress\\". But it's followed by more innovative genius, closing with \\"Clean\\". Complete with live drums, it sets the the stage for the album that would follow, Songs of Faith and Devotion. Brilliant.<br /><br />For the best DMode ever had to offer in one studio album, Violator packs a punch.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love love love Sylvia Day books  she has a way of writing that keeps you very interested.  I read all of here books
0385471378|2.0|This was for a school assignment. We ordered it using the ISN number, but the book we received was the wrong edition. We had to go to Barnes & Noble to buy the right one.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|A must-have for any Metallica fan! This EP is a great continuation to the amazing album Death Magnetic with the same driving tracks that were created on the previous album.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Lots of fun. Both of my grandsosns fight over the kindle just to play this game! maybe its time for another kindle!
B0000024IE|5.0|As they progressed through the years, they just appeared to get even better and more tuned into putting out one great hit after another and this album is yet another example of their greatness.
B009B4ZEMA|4.0|I love Christinas music and this cd did not let me down.Christina is one great artist.Listen to it and see if you like as much as i did.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is an awesome game. It is really fun! I almost like it more than the first temple run. I like the part when you ride in the boxcars in the mine! :)
B008XBCJ34|4.0|It was my fault for not reading the text but I ordered this thinking it was the extended version.  Great movie and the 3-d is nice!  (well, if you have a good 3-d TV to view it :p)
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Involved plots, good actors and enjoyable whit.  Nice to watch a series with more story line and less shock value.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book. Very interesting  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading Stephen King books Keeps you turning the pages
B009EEFTMC|3.0|This is nice but makes me nervous. I don't like to be timed and play games to relax. It will be great for someone who does like the challenge.
B000FS9MV0|4.0|Even though her voice has gotten stronger and more consistent, don't look for anything new and startling.  Ballads, jazz-inspired blues, and the occasional R&B tune.  A solid formula for an up-and-coming singer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is cool so many cool games in 1 app. My son loves them too.  Keeps my son busy for hours.
B00846REIS|5.0|A great dramatic love story!  This story holds well created events with realistic twists and characters that readers can identify with.  On to the second novel...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|wow. nuff said. this is a great free app. not too much brain power but enough to stimulate thought power
B00821OX98|5.0|Really enjoy this show looking forward to the next season, I hope Amazon will carry it under the prime membership.
1451695195|5.0|Reading his words gave me some peace and hope. I would recommend anyone o read it & keep an open mind.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|The first version of this app that I downloaded a year or so ago was really easy to use; after all the subsequent updates, I'm not as big of a fan. But, it does (usually) reliably record my favorite morning radio show, which is the whole reason I downloaded it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I followed this adventure on every page, quite enjoying the technological side as well as the story. If done properly this would indeed be a great movie.<br />I enjoyed the entire adventure and right up until the last pages, I was thinking - he's not going to make it, or he will just pass by the rescuers.<br />I so enjoyed this book - GREAT SPACE ADVENTURE *****
B0064MT1FI|1.0|I don't know what hold this movie had over me. It came out when I was younger; it might have been the revulsion my parents exhibited toward it that so enticed me. Now that I've seen it, I don't agree with their revulsion, but I do agree that it's slow, boring, and somewhat pointless. At least, to me - if there is some sort of point or lesson to this movie, I missed it. And there was a lot of naked Harvey Keitel and a little less of naked Holly Hunter - none of which seemed entirely necessary.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|If youve ever owned, played, or wished for a game that was worth while in both its entertaining looks as well as its mind-stimulating challenges, then consider Pudding Monsters.  This quirky alien puzzle game is eye can for any player of age, yet it possesses challenges that can stimulate the adult mind as you progress through many different levels after learning the ropes of the game little by little with these food creatures apparantly trying to escape a hungry humans refrigerator before its too late .  But beware, If youre a gamer that loves a challenge to the point of what is known as &quot;rage quitting&quot;, then you too may want to give it a try, as things may be slow in the beginning, but will indeed increase in difficulty, as the game forces you to actually think with a still mind for details instead of mindlessly progressing through levels. A game anyone can enjoy, P.M. is worth staring at your phone tablet  etc. for hours trying to escape a kitchen with these little guys....question is, when they finally escape, what then?  Find out when you download!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 1 was kind of eh, but season 2 picked up, and season 3 didn't disappoint. Big surprises await this season, and characters continue to believably develop.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is similar the Mario bros games but not quite the same. still I really like it and got both this and the second one :)
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The end was a grabber and will ensure that I will do season 4. But I thought it was a cheap shot to keep us hanging. Something else could have done the job.....
0770433782|5.0|A gorgeus book for those brides who wants the perfect wedding color designs and ideas for every detail you need!
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you are an avid puzzle person then you will enjoy this app. It is great for passing the time away.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so fun to play!!! Especially for long car rides! I love it;) I recommend it for everyone even if they don't like games like this&hellip;this game is boss;))
B004SYP5WC|3.0|Maybe for someone else this would be great, but as meticulous and detailed as I am I did not really like this app.  It felt difficult and time-consuming putting the information in.  I'm also very picky so this might be the perfect app for someone who isn't nearly as OCD about detail as I am.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book of The Hunger Games does not disappoint.I  enjoyed it as much as the first book, which was awesome.  A must read.
B004LUS390|4.0|Love the concept for this so much, and maybe my touch screen simply isn't responsive enough (HTC Amaze).  Most of the time it does a fantastic job for basic outlines and designs, but anything too detailed simply won't translate well on a mobile phone.  I'd love to try this out on a tablet; I bet it's fantastic.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm hooked on the Abbey!  What a fun group of characters to watch and such an interesting historical period.  I think Maggie Smith is just a hoot as the Dowager Countess and gets the funniest lines.  It is great to have this available for watching on my Kindle - I started watching late in Season 2, so being able to get Season 1 and 2 as a Prime member is really nice to have to get all caught up on the story lines.
B007TMON8M|5.0|At first, I was kind of irked by this game.  But the more I play it, the more I really enjoy the mental challenge it is.  Definitely not an all the time game, but if you're tired of mindlessly killing pigs or zombies definitely give this a try.  &#34;Smart&#34; games don't have to be boring!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love how extensive this app is. all of the different measurements give any reading or time-remaining on anything youd want.<br /><br />great job!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Who hates zombies?  Well, who hates KILLING zombies?  Not me, especially when plants are doing the murdering.  Haha.  It can get kind of repetitive after awhile but every now and again it's great to whip out and play this fun strategy game.<br /><br />Don't forget to collect the sunlight!
B005J4TLN4|5.0|I saw this at a film festival and the audience went nuts. Some of the accents are difficult to understand, but it's a great film to watch with a group of people.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have literally used this app every single day since I downloaded it.  It is the ONLY way I can get up and function in the mornings, as I am so not a morning person.<br /><br />The different settings are perfect.  I use the math problems which makes me mentally focus on solving them...usually so I can snooze.  But whatever.  I do get out of bed eventually...<br /><br />This has saved me many a day from being late to work.  FOR FREE.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a game that brings out the creativity in you, your survival skills and your thirst for adventure! This is the best game you could ever buy and I recommend this for people of all ages.
B008BIGEHG|2.0|Instead of images of maps, or scraps of paper that are SUPPOSED to be illustrated in the text, this has a bunch of random photos of David Suchet for no reason whatsoever.
B005JR47R6|5.0|So happy i was able to find this because i saw all but the very last episode and i have been looking for months for a way to watch it! Very pleased!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I love Adele. I love her sence of humor and ecpecially her music. I hope she keeps coming out with more.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Cool book to look stuff up with hahaha man you guys have a lot of words I have never heard of do you all no any more words that is not in hear just wondering hahaha did you make up some of these words it sure sounds like you did hahaha there are some big words in this big I mean big I am talking about big huge many page book but thanks for making this very good book!!!!!!!!
B009UZBLSG|5.0|Works great on my Nexus 4, just as described. Only complaint is that it took over 2 weeks to ship. Make sure your device supports slim port, this won't work on nexus 7.
0762439009|5.0|Mouse rug is not exactly like a rug from a movie, but very close. Quality of pad is high — it's soft. Better have laser mouse with it. It came rolled-up in a wrong way and it curls upwards while laying on the table. Can be resolved by rolling it up other side and leaving for a while.<br />Mug is ok, but I'd preferred the quote &#34;This agression will not stand, man&#34; on it.<br />Patch is ok, but dunno what will happen if you'll wash it.<br />Toe is like a toe.<br />Magnet is nice.<br />Book is of high quality, but much more a pamphlet.<br />Certificate is folded twice, so, it can't be placed in a frame like you want it.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the best kit for the best price. Only rug is worth ~11$.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictions. It's bright colors and music really add to it. I love e the things you can unlock!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fun and simple. &lt;3. I love how you earn more gems as you level off,  and that you can earn coins instead of buying them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfed Rio is the best ever I will not trade this game for the world ever well maybe or not!<br />This game is so great can not stop talking about it!
0446580848|4.0|I have followed the John Corey character since I got hooked by 'Plum Island'.  I thoroughly enjoy this character.  I have to admit, there is not a lot of action in this book so far - I'm about 3/4 of an inch from the end - so presume there's one big action as the last act.  And this big book takes place over a short span of time.  I am still totally engrossed.  I don't recall Corey being this stream-of-consiciousness witty and cleverly sarcastic.  I love it - am finding myself chuckling every page.  I am sure that's not everyone's favorite - it is mine (maybe because I couldn't think of one witty sarcasm myself, much less an entire book full of them).  I live in the Middle East and, never having been to Yemen, I'm understandably TOTALLY enjoying all the well researched (I am presuming, although I know a \\"Paul\\" and he denies \\"Bulus\\" means Paul in Arabic) details about Yemen's history and the bedouin mindset - well - actually a mindset the is pervasive among much of the Middle East poplulous.  It's fascinating to me.  If that appeals to you, you will find this book thoroughly enjoyable (not at all boring -like the first book that Clancey lent his name to after so many years - 'Against All Enemies' - slow as molasses and nothing like a Clancey book of old - I read about a quarter of it and it's on the shelf, likely forevermore).  'The Panther' moves along at a fast clip - there is a lot of information - it's a very good read - and has many, many chuckles (for most people).
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|Loved it. Thought it was darkly beautiful. My. favorite was gods and monsters. She is like a tragic angel. Very dramatic album.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The intention was to gift it. And I did. After reading it. Has some valid points. Highly recommend it. :o)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the game is amazing my friends like all this games we compete against each other and also my teachers like it also.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A fun puzzle game that's challenging at times, but you can work out the solutions before it gets too frustrating.  I could tell I was getting better after a few levels &amp; now I always go for the shortest number of moves to get the most enjoyment out out every level. This is my favorite
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I really like this game.  It doesn't have invasive permissions, which is an automatic point in its favor; but it is also well designed and entertaining.<br /><br />It is a simple game, in that it is a matching game, however the graphics are clean, the movement is very smooth, and response is quick and accurate.<br /><br />I enjoy the game.  I wish it had some settable options, like the option to turn off sounds and set difficulty, but I can forgive those for the fact that the game is well done.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|l iked this movie it was funny and would be a good movie for the whole family to enjoy. great family movie.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I haven't read the book, but others who have, told me they actually preferred the movie. Either way, it's a wonderful movie. I really enjoyed it and I'm LONG out of high school. The acting was superb. I'm not one of those detailed reviewers, but I can definitely say it's worth your time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Can anyone share their scores? My highest was about 500,000! Please tell me if you can! I recommend to people who are good at Temple Run and, people who have Temple Run.
B00797MB0O|1.0|waited for something to happen, it never did, this would make for a great Lifetime network movie of the week.<br />***spoiler alert*** moral of the story is if your a good looking blonde you can do whatever you want and you'll be fine.
B00633W614|5.0|Could't put it down once I started. Can't wait till third in series comes out.<br />Best Jeffrey Archer books in a long time.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie. Didn't know what to expect, so I was pleasantly surprised. Kristen & Charlise did great jobs. Looking forward to part 2.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really enjoy this app. Its a lot of fun, but sometimes it doesn't work. Other than that, its great. Overall, its a good app. I recommend buying it. Its free afterall.
B000005JAX|5.0|got this for my husband's birthday. he loves this album.  product arrived in great shape and arrived exactly in time for his birthday
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|I saw this for school, and I was disappointing. I felt as if it tried to make itself feel emotional, but absolutely failed and just made it dumb. The only reason I didn't give it a one star is Hugh Jackman. Anne Hathaway could've done better, and really, Russel Crowe, the bad-a gladiotar is in this piece of crapola! Thanks to this movie this should be in the comedy/musical section, cause this is just a musical joke!
B0027J4SKA|5.0|This is a fantastic artist. She sings very well, and each song has a different style in some ways, Not predicable. I will eventually buy all her CD's.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Everything about this movie is perfect. This DVD will be filled with too much perfection for my body to handle. I might never stop crying again! :p
B0062NAX1U|5.0|My husband and I watched the movie on TV, but wanted a copy for home.  It is a very nice move and worth seeing it.  love it, love it, love it......
B000O8OTNC|4.0|easy to use, i started to sharpen my chefs knifes and didnt think it was getting them sharpend so i ran my thumb down it gently and i was like why isnt this working. went to bend my finger and then started to bleed. happens that the knife was so sharp i didnt feel it cut the skin open. so id say this makes my knifes sharp lol.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game very fun to play and it is great for whole family fun for all look forward to advancing
B007KOMTUI|5.0|If you're buying season five, chances are you've already seen seasons one through four. And you don't really need to read this review to know how absolutely stunning this show is. Season five was super dark and edgy. Maybe my favorite one yet...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun<br />Love playing it makes me love horses so much<br />Can hardly put down my kindle fire already this just makes me that mush more addicted to it.
B00006AW2J|5.0|On Beggars Banquet the Stones put the psychedelia and the 60's rock and roll thing into the passenger seat and delivered a stunning album with deep blues roots.  This is one of my favourite Stones albums of all time and I think it is really just one of those albums that I will never tire listening to.<br /><br />  Really does not need a lot words here as so much has been said already and documented on this album.<br /><br />  What I can say though is that the sound on the ABKCO Hybrid SACD is very good.  This would be right up there with all the other ABKCO SACD's with excellent clarity , sound dynamics and mastering (Bob Ludwig) .<br /><br />It is the subtle things about this SACD that I notice ....things like clear multi-layered sound and instrument definition.  On &#34;Prodigal Son&#34; for example the acoustic guitar sounds like it is being played right beside you.<br /><br />A great album.....and a great SACD to boot.......
B002N1AF8G|5.0|These guys truly are the benchmark when electronic music was King.<br /><br />  When listening to this album it's like taking a musical documentary tour into this very basic invention of man - the bicycle along with the emotion and science involved with this most cherished transport.<br />  Also the various evolution connected with the sport of cycling are given meaning - Vitamin, Aero Dynamik, Titanium Elektro Kardiogramm, La Form, and Regeneration.<br /><br />  It's that Masterful.
1616550414|4.0|I bought this for my best friend who is a huge Zelda fan practically since birth. He loves the bright colors and pictures mixed in with the information.  Unfortunately, I do think I paid too much for the book. I paid $70 which was the price of the special edition which sold out months ago. Either way, he is happy and the book is well written and pretty.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|We bought this for our 4 month old. It is amazing and such an entertaining toy! *Make sure to turn it off when not playing because it is extremely sensitive and if you walk by it it will start laughing loudly. My husband got scared when it happened to him in the middle of the night.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great for my 7 yr old. She's entertained for hours just petting her horse on long car rides to keep away those words &quot;are we there yet.&quot;
B000005IZ8|5.0|Packed in plastic wrap and everything was great.  No peanuts to worry about so that was a good thing yep.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Really good knife sharpener at a more than reasonable price. Super happy with my purchase, definitely buying more in the future.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I loved this game it is sooooo so so so so so so so so so really really fun I totally recommend it
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for. Feels smooth. Hard shell so when I drop it, it won't break. The stand is pretty awesome, and definitely glad I got a case with one. Love the color, too!
B004CLYKLI|3.0|This book is very interesting at first. It's essays pit together to tell the story, some are linked better than others. I guess I was hoping for more of a point or resolution. It did give me some things to think about as a \\"Western mother.\\"
B0063IH60K|5.0|great!....always love solitaire!  even the different card choices of 1 or 3.  and a smile for my husband who leeks over my shoulder to help!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I love playing this game but I've noticed it cheats you out of coins you've won. For example; if you knock down more then one silver goon it only counts the 1st coin to drop. That sucks! !
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|These are 2 of my favorites actors and they sure did shine in this movie.  So real!!  I think a lot of people will certainly relate.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|I thought the movie had a great plot and it addressed an interesting topic.  Although it might be considered risque to think of brothers this close, they did a great job protraying the story and I was happy for them at the end.
B00622B3MY|2.0|the first cars move was great for my 2-3 yr old. He loved it so much that we bought part 2. It talks a lot about killing and blowing up each other and even torturing a car for info. FAR stretch from part 1 easy going, not too much bad guy for younger kids.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|This movie had no story and no plot.  I was extremely disappointed in the continuation of this series.  The previous have had somewhat interesting storylines, but this one ventured far from that.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Out of all the games on my tablet, this one gets the most use.  It is well worth the download!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My family and I love this show. This is the best show on television right now.<br />Every episode leaves me wanting more!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|We just bought a new 3-D TV and we were not sure just how well they worked.  So we bought this Blu-ray 3-D Avatar DVD and ... WOW!!  It works just like the theaters.  I don't honestly know just how much the quality of the DVD had to do with the picture quality, but, we were stunned as to how well it worked.  Have fun.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|i loved this book. the characters were wonderful. they were sexy, hot, and the theme was wonderful. i can't wait for the sequel.it is pre-ordered already. a fast and quick read
B009P5S11G|3.0|I bought this for one song only and that is the popular \\"Diamonds\\". I could do without the rest.  They don't appeal to me.  It seems like she is just getting nastier and trashier with each album.  I am not into smut.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|It won't load on my Nexus 7 tablet. I can only play it on my Kindle Fire. That is a huge bummer because I like my Nexus tablet sooo much better! These developers need to realize Amazon sells to people with all kinds of devices, and they need to make their apps/games work across the entire platform. Either that, or let us know in the description which version of Aneroid it's made for.
B005TZFZJC|1.0|I only like \\"You Da One\\" for its melodies and hook on this cd, but the lyrics turn sexual as usual and I really almost can't stomach her anymore. The music usually has good beats and melodies, but the lyrics are trash and quite embarrassing really.  I can't listen to most of her stuff around young kids and really I don't want to hear about men wanting her birthday cake and her wanting to F-them. It is really disgusting and trashy and lacking of talent lyrically and musically. People like who they like and my interest in Rihanna has waned.  I stopped buying her cds and usually look at singles that are edited or clean versions.  Her voice is not good and extremely computerized which is noticeable once she performs live. Her music is typically only attention-grabbing because of the beats or the hook.  Smutty.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Was reluctant to download another News app for fear of disappointment once again.  Am happy I took a chance because the BBC News app is simple, inclusive and thorough.  Thanks,  BBC.
B000W93CHC|2.0|Pillars of the Earth was one of my all time favorite books. This was just a copy with different characters. The characters were unlikable and the story line predictable. The continuous \\"bad guy destroys good guy just when they were about to have something good in life\\"  was over done and very monotonous.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An amazing journey. I feel I was Right there. Hungry, thirsty, PI me &the tiger!  Is it true???  I  like to think so.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Rich, complex, whimsical, magical, haunting, uplifting, humbling, chilling, intriguing, captivating, hypnotic, addictive, soul-satisfying sounds. I'm hungry for more, but all I can do is put the album on repeat and bliss out. If I was stranded on an island, I'd bring a solar charger, a CD player with rechargeable batteries, and this album.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I LOVE this!!! I do like the songs you hear on the radio, but the songs within this trilogy, are so much deeper, slower, sexier, and darker. I am very surprised, only because I was expecting maybe 2 or 3 more songs that I might like, but every song, is incredible.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|I love Wes Anderson and was so excited to add this to my collection! I bought it without ever seeing it(only the trailer) and I'm glad I did. Anderson never fails to please, his directorial style is just amazing and one reason I love his films so much, all of his films are artistic, witty, and cleverly cast. You will not be disappointed with this film especially if you are already an Anderson fan.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game because you can sort of feel what its like to own a hours plus the horse actually. looks real.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think this game is great, it has alright graphics and it seems to have been well thought out and planned well. This game is good to keep your children entertained and maybe some adults too;)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it has many new feauteres. but with my kindle fire it stutters. a lot. so be warned! it may do that to u.
B000B589JI|5.0|I love this little canister it is very handy to have with you if you don't want to carry the whole can of lighter fluid with you and you know you are going to need to fill up your lighter or hand warmer it hold enough to fill a large hand warmer
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Great!  Love the show!  Every episode ends with a cliffhanger.  Everybody dies at the end.  Lots of suspense.  But it now!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|THEY ARE THE BEST GAME THAT I HAVE PLAYED  THAT IS ALL THAT I`M GONE  TO SAY AT THIS TIME SO HAVE A GOOD DAY.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Has always been a favorite of ours and wanted to see it again after several years of looking for it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just love this book. Didn't want it to end. Now going to read the rest of the books. Then see the movie:)
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Purchased this as a Christmas gift and the receiver was so excited since this was exactly what they wanted.  Unable to comment further since it is up to the person who wants this how to judge.  I can say the person I gave this to would highly recommend the purchase.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|This is my first jack reacher book and it won't be my last enjoyable from start to finish an easy read
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is not fancy, but gets the job done with the expected solitaire rules. It is easy to understand, I think.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|As usual Michael Connelly has kept me interested to the very end.  Couldn't wait to get back to the book. Have read and enjoyed all of his Harry Bosch books and this one did not disappoint.  Would highly recommend it to my friends.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|This movie surpasses the previous and compares favorably to the original.  King Kong defends his lady love unto death.  He takes on 3 t rex's!  This battle scene rocks!  Any t rex weighed in at several tons.  In real life the t rex's would have won but this is Hollywood and the good guy prevails.  Enjoy!
B008476HBM|1.0|Eh this book was okay but i didnt really like it because i didnt understand it very much so eh
B009MO5960|5.0|Not the highest budget film, but the creators have played the games. Why can't we take time to enjoy what their thoughts are, or their creativity for the story of Resident Evil is. Going into the movies a fan or not, just go into it with an open mind. I think you should not be that disappointed.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The fact that the author, in the beginning, was skeptical to all these things, makes it worth reading...and believing!  A must-read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm not sure who plays this more me or my daughter!! This game is so fun :) A friend recommended this game to us...thanks.
B004YCKJSS|3.0|As a showcase for eye candy, the movie works.  The story is nothing extra.  Worth a look, especially for the pre-teen Nat Woman and her &#34;romance&#34; with a college guy.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|The excerises are easy to do and you need alot of room to do them, I would recommend this workout to my friends and family.
B00004TS0E|5.0|this is just a feel good movie and whenever i watch it, it just makes me feel better and with everything going on in the world we just need movies like this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's the best game of ever if u have Xbox live my gt is KAMP SCOPES just get the game it's worth it
B008MEM24S|5.0|I personally have enjoyed this far more than Angry Birds. I find it similar in that you must calculate trajectories accurately to complete levels but it requires a bit more puzzle solving logic = more fun to me!
B000002H48|5.0|No Nukes: Wonderful music from a special time with special musicians--wish there was more to hear from then.  Betther than the Woodstock album
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|great challenges, just wish their were more of them, finished in good time and then tried again until my eyes gave out
B008XG1X18|5.0|I thought pinterest would be another silly app, but I am now officially addicted goodbye Facebook, hello pinterest!! GREAT RECIPES!!
0618001905|4.0|used for a book review--fascinating reading--learned about the history of the<br />Belgiun Congo.  A must read for anyone interested in the background of that area of<br />africa,
B0011Z51T8|4.0|Heavy focus on slide guitar. Very blues oriented. Lots of good driving songs! I had this album on CD originally and lost it. Now I have it in the cloud. Pretty cool.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Not a hugh fan of Buble but beautifully done and instantly loved.  I bought this for my wife and I then couldn't stop listening.  This will become a Christmas classic.  Mostly traditional Christmas favorites set to great arrangements and performed with great style and class.  Every family should have this recording.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I got this book through a Amazon Local deal for $1. I wanted something light and easy to read after finishing a dense book. However, after stewing over the ending, this book leaves the reader with much to think about. The last third of the book had me racing through the pages to get to the next chapter. I think that the ending was satisfying and warming.<br /><br />I did think that the book had a lot of fluff filler in the first half. That is starkly contrasted with the demonic and dark telling of past stories in a character's childhood. I found the flashbacks the most riveting and was left longing for that passion for storytelling to find it's way across the years into the character's present.<br /><br />Overall, I was transported into 1970's Ireland and reveled in the escape that the book provided.
B008ELUEQC|3.0|Bought this for my wife along with the Bubly Christmas CD.  Stewart sounds like Stewart and it is hard to listen to Christmas favorites sung by someone with such a distractingly coarse singing voice.  It doesn't get much play time in our house.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book seemed so different from the other Nicholas Sparks' books I've read.  Happily, not a tear-jerker!!  Did kind of remind me of &#34;Sleeping With The Enemy&#34;, but it certainly held my interest.
B00003CX8U|5.0|Good movie<br /> - have seen it before and enjoy the story and music.  Problem is I have put it somewhere and cannot find it now
B007N31YQ6|5.0|This has been and will always be my favorite movie of all time. Julia Roberts is a star, and the supporting cast is far-and-away one of the best in many years. The story still remains gold after all of these years.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray and digital copy added for the 100th Anniversary edition, I have not used the digital copy, but the Blu-ray is PHENOMENAL. It was crystal clear on a 1080p screen.<br /><br />I do have to say, one of my favorite things about this purchase is the slip cover for the movie. It has a timeline for Universal with a focus on Erin Brockovich (of course). Such a wonderful movie to add to my collection.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everything about this show is amazing! I was able to view the whole season from amazon prime wilth great quality!
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|This is a unpredictable rock narrative.<br />I found it to be provocative and intriguing.<br />Reeds ranting soliloquy is haunting accompanied by a progressive, mood enhancing battery of audio supplied by metallica. Although this is not necessarily a musically focused endeavor, there are many parts that standout as musically fascinating.<br />Loved it !!!
B005H0CBZ0|4.0|I have read this series before but wanted to do so again. great having the electronic version. A series of books to keep
B0090X4GLW|5.0|The CD was new and works perfectly, no issues in CD player or anything.  I have listened to it 5 times already in one day
B004UID2LC|1.0|My kindle fire alerted me the second it downloaded that it is a malicious application. I uninstalled it immediately. BUYER BEWARE.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|This romantic comedy is one of my very favorites! It is always funny to watch, even though I have seen it over 5 times!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Love this book because it's about Jack Reacher. He is rough, rugged, smart and somewhat of a mystery. The thrill of the hunt and chase are always present and I am always surprised at how Jack wraps things up. You love one Reacher novel, you love them all.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I ordered this move for gifts. I have this movie and wanted to share the store with my friends of this amazing dog.Anyone who watches it will be touched. This a must have movie.
B003TOMAPC|3.0|I felt like this was pretty good overall but I also felt like there could have been a lot more done with it. I was entertained but not riveted. And I love Nicolas Cage
B008MEM24S|4.0|My four- and eight-year-old children love to play this game. I like it because it isn't too loud. They are teaching me how to play it because they figure it out faster than I do!
B00846F1YW|4.0|This is the 2nd hidden object game fromNevosoft that I have played. Mysteryville2 is a nice game. My only complaint is that some of the items are under the top banner and cannot be selected. (I play this on my Kindle Fire.
B0037W68F4|5.0|First things first, I am a huge fan of their first band GLITTER PENIS 2000! [...]. From the We Care EP's, to Oracular Spectacular, if you listen to them correctly, you can feel their psychedelic vibe right away. I am really proud to of not fallen victim to what the critics had to say about this album. I listened to it on my own, no skips, front to back, had an intuitive feel for it, after about the 3rd listen. Actually, I've been listening to this non-stop for right around 3 years now, and have incorporated it into the very carbon-based molecules that compose my body, in the form of a tattoo. This is one of those albums I will never forget. I am looking forward to their next installment coming in JUNE 2013. My hopes are that they'll find a way to let their label release their full 5 hours improv jam sessions. Or perhaps even a collaboration with PANDA BEAR <333
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great story. Nicholas Sparks did it again. The book was a sweet love story with lots of excitement to keep you on the edge of your seat. I can't wait to see the movie.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|The item was delivered on time and in good condition as stated.  The cover was somewhat scratched but nothing I couldn't live with.  Overall, it was a good purchase at a good price. This CD is one that you can pretty much let play all the way through.  I love the slower reflective songs and then Ms.Rae can rock you as well. This one stays in my car--it's a winner!!!
B0063IH60K|2.0|Kind of tough to understan. Give me the good old &#34;spider solitaire&#34; This is too hard to enjoy. Didn't think it was fun or entertaining.
B00AFEY354|2.0|Tough movie.  Watched this with my 13 year old daughter and some of the subject matter was too much for her.  I believe any movie should stand on its own and not be compared to the original book (which I have not read).<br /><br />This is a good movie about friendship -- extraordinary young actors!  Being a friend means accepting the whole person; that was the good message in the show.  Some of the best laughs and warmest feelings come from this group of 'wallflowers' or misfits fitting in with each other.<br /><br />But, some of the other topics made this too much for my early teen to take.  Me, too.  Couldn't anyone in the show not have tragedy in their lives current or past?  So glad the friends were there for the main character at the end, the uplift was good. But overall, too sad.<br /><br />I would only recommend this for very mature early teens or mid-teens. Be prepared for very troubled, deep, and dark themes, but the friendship made and saved this movie.  It's not a happy movie.<br /><br />SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS<br />Some of the other subjects were hard to take, too many in fact.  My daughter missed some of the references to Sam's promiscuous past, an adult in her past who acted inappropriately to her, the deleted scenes about the sister's preganacy situation missed out on seeing Charlie as someone who was there for his loved ones but still more sad, a friend with possible bulimia, a teen who can't face being gay and his father who beats the son for being gay, lots of drinking and some drug use, the aunt molesting the main character was not revealed until toward the end of the movie was just too much to take by then as you are weighted down by all the sadness surrounding and happening to Charlie.  If you are questioning whether to have your child watch this movie, you should know about all the tough topics.
B0098460O4|4.0|I saw Jonathan & Charlotte on Britain's Got Talent and was taken by their loyalty to each other.  I must say that Jonathan's voice gives me the chills.  It is so powerful and full of emotion.<br /><br />I noticed on YouTube that Charlotte's voice was a bit shrill and over time she has modified that aspect of her voice.  Now this Together is completely mixed for pleasant listening enjoyment.  I love the songs and I think you will too.
B000OP1M6M|5.0|This watch is a must have. My collection would not be the complete without this excellent time piece, I'm thinking to get me another one in a different color.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love playing Angry Birds, Seasons Free.  The shaking with the bomb and all the seasonal interfaces are fun, entertaining and interesting.  I play 2 a day to pass some time, never stopping until I get the 3 stars.  Lots of Fun!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love The Hunger Games series! The books are so hard to put down once you have started reading. Can't wait for the next movie to come out!
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|In a land where everyone is a psychopath... except for one... and he really wants to be.<br />Acting was good but the story was thin and you don't end up liking any of the characters.
1451695195|5.0|An intriguing book to read.  Being in health care, I especially enjoyed reading the physiology and his way of describing that aspect.  Compelling, proof that God is more than we perceive.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very fun. I love the new features, like the zipline, mine cart, spike wheels, and jewels. You should definitely download this, especially if you like temple run 1 and subway surfers.
B009MF56GC|1.0|Expendables one is worth watching.  This movie attempts irony in it's kitschy self awareness and fails at it, life, the universe, and everything.<br />Fortunately my sister has terrible taste in movies so christmas decisions don't tax my smouldering and already overtaxed remnants of an excuse for a functional brain.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Game is thhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeee best angry birds ever! Any butty disagrees DO not listen !!!!!!! Only thing bad you have to pay for an entire world! Unless you think you can 3 star every level:(
B006U1KUR6|5.0|Gaiman never disappoints.<br />This man makes me wish I had supernatural powers so I could change myself into a woman and go to whatever time and place would easiest facilitate me bearing his children.  No homo.
0307950689|3.0|This is a difficult book to rate because the parts I liked, I really liked; but the parts I didn't, I really didn't like. The plot is really good, but too often when a deadline is rapidly approaching or the foes are fast approaching, there is a lecture that goes on and on and on. Now most of the time the contents of the lecture needed to be communicated to educate either the characters or the reader, but Brown needed to find a better delivery system. I found myself seemingly much more tense about the bad guys around the corner than the players. But still, I liked the story, so I was prepared to give it a four-star rating. That changed, however, when the action ended, but another lecture began that went on forever. And since the action was over, the lecture's only purpose could be Brown telling people what to believe. This book is focused on Freemasons 110 percent, and I have no idea if the information was true or not, and really don't care. I knew it was fiction and so if Brown stretched some things, so be it. I don't look to fiction to gather knowledge but to entertain. The many lectures included in the book did dampen the entertainment level.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|If you like action flicks and are tired of over produced hollywood crap where dudes wearing thousands of dollars of make up attempt to convince you they're genuine tough guys, watch this to cleanse the proverbial palate.<br />The plot is fairly simple, the acting is pretty good, and the action is top notch.<br />This is a bunch of ass kickers kicking ass because some asses need kicked.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Loved the story. Disliked that half the story involved Ethan and Lena in a weird love hate relationship, but I suppose if they hadn't been the ending wouldn't have been so sweet. It was nice to see Rid turn a corner for the good, then intriguing to see her start to possibly turn again...looks like book three is a must!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|This mp3 album is dirt cheap, and the band and album are a great find. The black keys are two guys from Ohio, rocking and jamming together. Money maker (track 5) is my personal favorite (you will hum along to it the very first time you hear it i swear.) Their songs are pretty harmonic and the beats are loud and consistent.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show. It keeps me on the edge of my seat and leaves me wanting more at the end of each episode.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|this is a great app. Have it on multiple devices.  Works great and I recommend it to anyone who needs a virtual note pad.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I spent a lot of time looking for an alarm clock app to use when traveling.  My phone alarm worked but... looking for something that may display the time, let me choose what song to wake up to, and would work even if I just set the alarm, and set it aside (would turn itself on and sound the alarm).<br /><br />I tried several free alarms, and none worked well.  This one you can go into settings and put on &#34;nightstand mode&#34; which will display the time.  You do want to leave that off if it is not plugged in, but I just plug it in when I am traveling and leave it on my night stand as a clock.  A swipe of the finger makes it brighter or dimmer.  Also shows the weather (temp and wind speed), which is a nice little added feature.  The free one does not allow you to do some of the things that the paid one does, so after trying the free one for a while, I did upgrade.  The free one does have an annoying thing of asking you to upgrade often (want two alarms, upgrade today, want to play your own music, upgrade today).<br /><br />I use this about once a week, and in the past 4-5 months I had either the alarm not sound, or slept through it once.  i was in a very noisy place, and I suspect that it may have gone off and I slept through it, but not sure.  If I absolutely, positively have to get up, I set a second alarm just to make sure, but I do that at home when I have something I have to attend the next morning.<br /><br />All around good app.  Has what I need, without a lot of extras I don't.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app.  I've gotten a lot of helpful tips and it's great seeing all the stuff that everyone is tracking.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I am a minister, and already own lots of paper Bibles, but it was free, so one more never hurts.  it does have &#34;The Message&#34; which I appreciate, but does not have NSRV (which is the one my church reads from).  It was a little confusing at first to switch between versions, but once I got that down, it is good.<br /><br />It does have a lot of features I don't use.  You can add notes, bookmarks and stuff like that.  Also has several reading plans (if you want to read the whole Bible, it will tell you how you can do it in X number of days, weeks or years).  It does pop up messages about once a week, asking if you want to start reading a verse of the day, or the scripture for the day, or something like that, but since I don't, no big deal to hit &#34;clear&#34; and it is gone.<br /><br />But if you are looking for a good resource.  Maybe read a different version of a verse you heard in church, or something like that, this is good.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Love this game and have it on all my devices.  Only problem I've had is when I upgraded my phone, the history didn't transfer with the SD card.
1439102813|4.0|Fabulous book and an easy read. Fascinating topic. Read it for a class but was so glad it was part of the course.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Played all the games prior to seeing the movie.  After seeing the movie, really understood the game more.  Fun and entertaining.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This truly was a great story. I loved how the characters unfolded in this story but still have so much room to grow. Then the end...was not expecting that! On to number three!!!
B004WY2M8I|5.0|Still reading this series and it came highly recommended from a friend who already read. Great series to read when I have time.
B007SGM084|5.0|Before I knew what this story was about, I thought it would be more about the life of s&m and to my suprise, there is actually a story line! I could not put it down! I am thinking about reading it again!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|REad the book and now need to see the movie. It is interesting story line and anxious to read soon.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover knows her stuff!! This story was sweet, heart warming, gut wrenching and just plain out made me ugly cry.. Worth every emotional second !!!!
B000YJ54DU|3.0|Like a TV show with a strong dynamic hero figure, Reacher has begun to 'devolve'.  He is losing the parts of him that made him likeable and becoming more psychopathic.  He is colder now.  In the first book I felt such empathy for the man who wanted to know his country and could not bear injustice to civilians.  In Nothing to Lose he wages war on an entire town because they turned him away.  Child's writing is still good.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|sci fi always has this chance to be great. i was really surprised after taking a chance on this. just watch it
B004I8WD6E|1.0|This cover put multiple scratches on my phone. terrible. don't buy it.it does exactly opposite of protecting your phone.<br />It is very stiff and ugly too.
B0089XH38M|1.0|Normally I would rate AVG 5 but it is not designed for my device. I use avast but even that has problems.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|cubistry: its an okay game haven't  played it enough to give a proper review. Dislike giving written review of products
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Works fine if you want to watch what they provide by default. Search is not to intuitive. Will uininstall if I need the room.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun! you can have your own horse and train it for competitions,  keep the stables clean, and much more. This game teaches you how much work there really is if you have a horse. I love it and I'm sure you will too.
B000I0QL82|5.0|This movie will always be a classic and with Fred and Bing you can't go wrong.  Supper great movie foe everone..

B007IXWL2C|1.0|If you had a &#34;Zero Stars&#34;, this would rate zero.  So empty of any real meaning.  Just gratuitous sex.  I could not finish the first book, let alone tackle two more!  Don't waste your money.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a cool app! If you like architecture, this is the app for you. It is definitely worth the price. I love building my own buildings and sculptures!
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading The Hunger Games, I was so riveted by Katniss Everdeen's uncanny ability to survive in the harsh conditions of the arena that I immediately began reading Catching Fire. Let's just say I was not disappointed! Though this book started out a little slow, it quickly snowballed into a thrilling story with unexpected twists and turns.<br /><br />If you thought the ending of The Hunger Games was crazy, just wait until you get to the end of Catching Fire. I highly recommend this book!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I loved it before on the PC. I love it on the tablet. It drives me crazy not just to distraction.
B0091ICDHU|5.0|I had to give this book 5 stars, if I could do more I would! This book is a wonderful, sad, romantic love story that will make you cry, laugh, want to write poems, and gasp!! From the first chapter to the last you will be capivated and can't wait to read book 2

B004XDYJRU|4.0|I use this and Pandora for thise times when I want somehing other than &#34;the usual&#34;<br />This one because I can listen to stations from countries I have lived in the past and thus get music and news and Pandora ...well thats another story.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Good game all round can't say much about it other  than the fact it's like every other app where they are always trying to get not  money off you
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|A bit of silly fun for the family, we all enjoy it. Kid really loves the draw and play idea.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best running game made! The difficulty increases when you get farther in the game. I like that u dont have to turn the tablet to change lanes. Im telling u, get this game!!!!!!!!!
B00005QEO1|5.0|This was their last great album of the 1980's, but that doesn't mean it was their last great album ever. I was already familiar with some of the songs on this album, but the rest of the songs were entirely new to me when I listened to it all the way through. \\"Don't Get Mad, Get Even\\" is a nice little tune that suggests what you should do if someone ticks you off, and \\"What It Takes\\" is a real blues infused love gone wrong song if ever there was one. I highly doubt there are any bad reviews for this album, but if there are any, don't listen to them. This is a must have for any Aerosmith fan, new or old.
0446573027|4.0|I had been a big fan of Baldacci early in his career but he fell out of favor with me after finding many of his books in recent years to be more miss that hit. I won't spend time describing Zero Day's plot as this can be found by reading the Amazon Book Description above. I will, however, spend some time describing why I think Zero Hour is more hit than miss and is worth reading -- if you can suspend your sense of disbelief a bit more than usual.<br /><br />On ths plus side, (1) Baldacci writes in a style that does an above average job in maintaining reader interest, (2) the plot is complex enough to keep the reader guessing about the motives behind the multiple murders that occurred in a small West Virginia and about will happen next, (3) the main character -- Army CID Investigator John Puller -- is likable and pretty well developed (although he is very reminiscent of another larger-than-life character, namely Jack Reacher), and (4) there is a decent amount of action that occurs throughout the book (although if you're looking for non-stop action and excitement you're likely going to be a bit disappointed).<br /><br />While I said Zero Day is more hit than miss, it does have the following misses that result in my deducting one star (actually 1 1/2 stars, if possible) from my rating: (1) Although a fun read overall, I feel the book would have benefited from being 50-75 pages shorter, as I found that the plot dragged at times, (2) most of the secondary characters were thinly developed and (3) without going into detail, the \\"off the cuff\\" very detailed scientific information Puller's brother -- imprisoned for life for treason -- provided John Puller to enable him to \\"save the day\\" really required me to suspend belief somewhat more than I was willing to, and (4) the climax, while entertaining, was pretty far-fetched  -- again requiring the reader to suspend belief.<br /><br />As you can see from my comments, I enjoyed Zero Day but it is far from a flawless book. Despite its flaws, I plan to read the next book in the series, The Forgotten, featuring Jack Puller.its flaws, I plan to read the next book in the series, The Forgotten, featuring Jack Puller.

B0058VA2U4|4.0|Anthrax's tenth studio album was a long-time in the making -- and I mean, A LONG time. Following the release of \\"We've Come For You All\\" in 2003, the New York-based thrash metal quintet underwent a lineup change that saw then frontman John Bush being replaced by original vocalist Joey Belladonna. Then, following various delays and postponed release dates, the band finally kicked out a long-awaited, and highly anticipated new record eight-whopping whole years later, in 2011.<br /><br />But even though Anthrax reunited with four-fifths of their original lineup, \\"Worship Music\\" is not what it was heavily blog-rumored to be, the long-awaited follow-up to 1986's watershed release \\"Among The Living.\\" Well, actually, it both isn't, but also, to some extent, is. See, while this album is not as consistently heavy and blistering all the way through as \\"Living,\\" it is a quality piece of thrash/speed metal, and one that boasts memorable riffs and ripping solos. \\"W.M.\\" is also home to some of the absolute best and most infectious, irresistible, and powerful choruses in the Anthrax playbook. As a result, the majority of the band's fanbase will most definitely be left wondering why they ever kicked out Belladonna not once, but twice!<br /><br />\\"Earth On Hell\\" is one early standout. It is fat with big, fat thrash riffing driven-home by powerful double bass slamming, and tosses in mini, screaming guitar solo for good measure. And its neighboring song, \\"The Devil You Know,\\" is propelled by catchy staccato chugging, rhythmically-stomping beats, and really memorable vocal patterns (including truly unforgettable choruses comprised of wailing clean vocals and a shouted refrain). And next in line comes \\"Fight `Em `Til You Can't.\\" It is the album's clear-cut choice for a lead single because it boasts hooky, head-bangable chugging and instantly memorable, fist-pumping choruses.<br /><br />Those are some of the record's biggest standouts, but certainly not the only ones. Some of the other best moments include the Dio/Pantera tribute that is the epic seventh track, \\"In The End\\"; the rolling, martial, crashing, forty-plus second long drum solo that comprises the interlude-esque \\"Hymn 2\\"; \\"Judas Priest,\\" which marries a crunchy, chugging thrash riff very fittingly with Rob Halford-indebted clean singing, a funky, twangy-sounding bass part, and positively anthemic choruses; and the thunderous and blistering, old-school-esque thrash out that is the set closer, \\"Revolution Screams.\\"<br /><br />But \\"Worship Music\\"'s highpoint, however, is probably song number five, \\"I'm Alive.\\" It boasts a forebodingly mid-tempo pace (including a slow-burning intro), an ominous, churning guitar lick, a menacingly heavy and downtuned bass tone, and another excellent and instinctively memorable chorus (which is complete with a really catchy sing-along refrain: \\"Hey-ayyyy\\"). And the handful of memorably ripping, shredding, and \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell-sounding solos that pierce the air, here, only further the song's strong case for being the record's pinnacle.<br /><br />When all is said and done, the eight year-long hiatus may have been a bit much (and not to mention inexplicable), but there is no reason for any Anthrax fan to worry. They are back, and in fine form, here. So, needless to say, they are still very capable of delivering the goods. And that is precisely what they do on \\"Worship Music.\\" I will be the first fan to pre-order the next album, so long as someone can promise me that it will ship sometime before 2019!est moments include the Dio/Pantera tribute that is the epic seventh track, \\"In The End\\"; the rolling, martial, crashing, forty-plus second long drum solo that comprises the interlude-esque \\"Hymn 2\\"; \\"Judas Priest,\\" which marries a crunchy, chugging thrash riff very fittingly with Rob Halford-indebted clean singing, a funky, twangy-sounding bass part, and positively anthemic choruses; and the thunderous and blistering, old-school-esque thrash out that is the set closer, \\"Revolution Screams.\\"<br /><br />But \\"Worship Music\\"'s highpoint, however, is probably song number five, \\"I'm Alive.\\" It boasts a forebodingly mid-tempo pace (including a slow-burning intro), an ominous, churning guitar lick, a menacingly heavy and downtuned bass tone, and another excellent and instinctively memorable chorus (which is complete with a really catchy sing-along refrain: \\"Hey-ayyyy\\").

B008YZXYY2|4.0|A decade ago, Stone Sour took the world by storm with their self-entitled debut. Four years later, they returned with the even-more-excellent \\"Come What(ever) May.\\" And ever since then, the band has been trying to out-do themselves by coming up with an equally-as-irresistible sequel to past hit singles such as 2002's \\"Bother\\" and 2006's \\"Through Glass.\\" But so far, they have not been able to do so, What they HAVE been able to do, though, is come up with a really dynamic, epic, and expansive sonic range; one that varies from melodic hard rock to progressive balladry to nu/alternative metal to even full-on thrash. And, as 2012's \\"House Of Gold And Bones (Part One),\\" proves, Corey Taylor (who was initially of Slipknot fame) and the gang are also highly capable of writing a deep and moving concept album, in this case one detailing a man (Taylor) who is at a crossroads in life, and is now faced with many moral questions. And finally, \\"House\\" also showcases Stone Sour's increased instrumental abilities, as it boasts some surprisingly complex guitar work.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Gone Sovereign,\\" a strong set opener that reminds of \\"Vol. 3\\"-era Slipknot, with its blistering thrash riffs, vocals that morph from melodic singing to vehement screams, thumping drums, stomping groove, and lengthy, winding melodic solo section; and ends with  \\"Last Of The Real,\\" which has a noteworthy bass intro that gives way to galloping, mosh-pit-ready guitar licks and fittingly violent lyrics (i.e. \\"I'll tear this place apart!\\"). For another piece of brutal, viscerally satisfying metal, also consider \\"RU486,\\" the record's heaviest moment, with its crunchy, belligerent riffing, really memorable vocal patterns (including a powerful shout-along refrain), and grumbling bass bottom. Then, top it all off with a fairly ripping guitar solo or two, and the end result is a very aggressive, intense, and energetic modern thrasher that is sure to be the anthem for many-a-circle-pit.<br /><br />\\"The Travelers (Pt. 1)\\" is the set's first ballad, and what a memorable, epic, tear-jerking, and lighter-waving ballad it is, too, and one that has plenty of nicely melodic leads and amazing clean singing. The album's two other ballads are \\"Taciturn\\" and the piano-based \\"The Travelers (Pt. 2),\\" two other lovely and mournful, strings `n' all numbers with positively beautiful vocals and impassioned lyrics. (Just try to get the part in the latter song where Corey wails \\"I'm on my own!\\" out of your head.)<br /><br />\\"Absolute Zero\\" is another standout, as it is backed by a really catchy and memorable chug-and-stomp, and is anchored by a grungy-sounding bass line, and features another respectable guitar solo and a super-infectious sing-along refrain (\\"Hey-ey-ey!\\"). And \\"A Rumor Of Skin,\\" which has a really catchy and borderline-thunderous rhythm threaded by interesting, wah-drenched leads, is another.  But one must not forget to also mention \\"Tired,\\" or its catchy, staccato, fist-pumping guitar and bass licks, and instantly memorable and very impressive vocal performance (including a truly soulful and unforgettable chorus).<br /><br />As mentioned, \\"House Of Gold And Bones\\" does not quite live up to the promise that Stone Sour achieved on their first two full-lengths. But it sure comes close. This is one darn fine hard rock/alt metal album, and one that should please both fans and newcomers alike.he Travelers (Pt. 1)\\" is the set's first ballad, and what a memorable, epic, tear-jerking, and lighter-waving ballad it is, too, and one that has plenty of nicely melodic leads and amazing clean singing.

B007W1BLN0|5.0|This movie was inspirational to me. The photography was excellant and story was very emotional. I recommend this to everyone.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|not as enthraling as the lion. nor as remarkable as brad thor's wonderful thrillers, but nevertheless, still fun to read. corey still delights, and the insight into our intelligence apparatus is well done.<br />i will continue to read these great authors until they run out of material, which seems unlikely.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really like this app. I use some of my downloaded music for the alarm. You just have to make sure you leave the kindle on -- which I do when I charge it up overnight. Of course,  if you have a smart phone,  you can use the alarm on that. But I take my kindle everywhere and just like using this app.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|This is yet another PIXAR animation that comes jam packed with fun and meaning. The whole family can enjoy this movie and you may even be able to teach your kids something (not to mention learn something as a parent as well). Enjoy!
B008MAI0WK|4.0|Having finished as MSc EE 25 years ago, and hardly touched hardware since I needed something to dust of what I once learned. I will be using the PI to make project with my 10-year old, and he was equally excited with the book content.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Good book.  Kept me interested.  A unique twist (as unlikely as it might be) to it, which was interesting.  Good read.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I went to see this movie with my grandson and loved it. I ordered this one and 2 others to have here for them to watch at spring break.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I was very happy with this product.  Good quailty, it was just what I was looking for, at a great price.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|The book is drama filled,heartbreaking,sad,happy, and relieving at the same time.  Especially in the first chapter u sometimes wanna throw the book up against a wall but then in the end u wanna hug it and dance with it. This book is worth your money.<3
B003Y5H574|4.0|This was Ryan's movie.  He was hysterical in it.  However the movie could have been cut in half.  Definately some slow periods.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Nice game, couple minutes play time for a game is just right.  At first pass both play modes are different challenges for my brain and eyes.  Most amazing to me is the control on my Xoom, even with my fat fingers the game has no problem selecting the square I meant to click on.<br /><br />Worth a buck, but free is good too.
B000IZC7WG|4.0|Don't leave your seat while watching this movie.  It's hard enough to understand when you sit through the entire movie without a rest room break.  To be honest, I had to watch this movie twice in order to somewhat get it.  As usual, great acting by Ryan.
0671891634|5.0|I rated the book and service 5 star because all aspects of the purchase were just as I expected. I live in New Zealand so getting the book in excellent condition without hassles and on time was great when so many things could have gone wrong.
B0055S348W|3.0|Downloading is easy and installing my printer is easy. However I have yet to get anything to print. Obviously not as user friendly as it could be. If i can get it to work eventually i may revisit my rating.
B00013BN4S|5.0|This was one of my favorite albums in my long ago vinyl collection. While I am not really a fan of country music, Emmy Lou is in a class by herself, more bluesy than country. That's my story and I'm stickin' to it!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|The drama with cut-throat action is not on par with previous books in series. I miss some of my favorite characters. Too much fluff.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Ever since I first heard Susan Boyle on America's Got Talent, I have been a fan.  What an awesome voice. After reading her biography, I discovered she wasn't a flash in the pan, but the product of a lifetime of work. I will buy anything she releases.
B00992CF6W|4.0|when I downloaded it I played it for atleast two hours it was fun to do you cant stop building and crafting u gotta luv it
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This is direct from the Frank Miller story, awesome job bringing it to life.  only thing would love to have seen it as one movie rather then a part 1 and 2
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|my family loves this game soooo much they always want to play it hmmmm that addictive hm?! lots of fun I got a jetpack that shoots bubbles and I got a Mohawk oh yeah!
0307591549|4.0|If I got a penny for everytime Harvard is mentioned, this book would not only be free, but I would actually make money.<br /><br />When he was younger, he's undoubtedly that incredibly annoying guy at the party who managed to bring up the fact that he was going to Harvard in every conversation. Actually, now that he's older, he's probably still that guy.<br /><br />Overall, the book is interesting and fun to read, despite knowing you're playing a role in the author falling inlove with himself even more.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|good read, soft porn, not literature, fun, book one and two are good book three not needed at all. However, I certainly understand taking advantage of a good thing and maximizing profit.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I AM AWESOME<br />This app rocks it's worth the money so just get it it's perfect and even an awesome person thinks so,
B007IXWKUK|5.0|good read, not great literature, but nice soft porn, geared to women, guys might pick up a tip or two, so its worth it for them to scan through it
B00005R24K|5.0|It's a cult classic. The case on the hand is a &#34;jewel&#34; case. Super cheap and its hinges came broken. The DVD is fine but its annoying that the case doesn't stay together.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|book one and two were pretty decent, book three was unnecessary, but I guess when your on a roll ($$$$) you might as well rack up what you can. Good soft porn, not high literature, but a fun read
B004LROUW2|5.0|Page-turner with alternate realities, long-lost love, compelling characters and more. Ends with some unanswered questions--come to your own conclusions as the protagonists do!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I watched the Swedish version of the movie first and then bought the books both  were great. I have not watched the American movie version
B00005JKNB|5.0|Arrived in good time & was enjoyed as a gift to my mother for Christmas. good to do business with!
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|The writing is fun, the characters endearing and the friendship real; finally a show that lives up to the legacy left by Friends! The character development and the relationships between them progresses at a good pace, slow enough to feel real and fast enough to keep you interested. You'll laugh out loud several times with each episode!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|All of the hype surrounding this trilogy had my anticipation running high. I felt the story was ok except the leading female should be a stronger force if we are to believe she is so 'in command' of Mr. Grey. I absolutely think the author (and editor(s) should have noticed/corrected the redundant use of descriptors in the intimate area. There is a lack of imagination in trying to create a smoldering sensual setting in this book because it is not new after one has read the first one. Decent story but many who read may be able to recall more intensity in his/her own past.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it! this game is amazing it'd almost like taking care of a real horse excepet its a game and you can't do shows or other stuff that easy.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I am not really big on playing games.  With that being said, this game is awesome!  It is an interactive game that you draw what you need instead of spending a lot of time tying to find an object.  I am not really good at drawing, but can do well enough to get by. I think that just adds to the fun of the game.<br /><br />If you like adventure games, this would be a great time waster for you.  I recommend this for everyone of all ages.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is a captivating author, very hard to put down. Safe Haven has all the ingredients of a classic Sparks novel
B00846F1YW|5.0|If u like hidden object games then you will love this one!  It is so much fun. If you are not careful you will play it for hours and not even realize it!
0553382179|5.0|a must have for all EXTREMELY busy moms! This is a very helpful guide with small steps at a time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read her other books.  This was my favorite!  I love her writing style and can't put her books down.  Her characters are so real and vivid in my mind.  This book would be a great movie!
1844488748|5.0|This book is just too beautiful! I have been making lots of different flowers lately-anyone who makes them knows it can be addictive. I have tried a few of her techniques- some of them are very involved- but I will still give it shot:) I can't wait to buy some of her ribbon from her website.  Beautiful colors-very special!  Even if you don't make one flower- you will not regret buying this book-the images are just lovely!
B000OBYLVO|5.0|My sister and I love this movie and its one you can watch again and again!!! Jude Law is dreamy!!
B0099TJ4YQ|4.0|James Taylor is one of my favorite folk singers.  This Christmas album contains some familiar songs in his special style and a couple I had not heard before.  Well done!
B005COO1X6|3.0|Definitely not one of Stephen King 's best works. The \\"car that eats people\\" theme is too reminiscent of Christine, and is poorly executed. I only gave it three stars because, hey, it's Stephen King.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I thought this game was quite entertaining.  Love the hidden object aspects but there is so much more.  Don't start if you really have something else to do because it's so easy to lose track of time.
B001WCN23W|5.0|Words can't do this CD justice.Arguably the best Stones album.Thats if you can choose one over another.I don't know that you can.You can't buy just one song from this one.They are all fan-tastic!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very good game. It is so much fun and they have cool tack, I love horses and the horses on the game are so realistic. There are some downs like how you can't get gems that easy which makes me mad because i don't like buying things, but other then that this is an amazing game and I'm happy I got it. Great game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This movie was disappointing and hard to watch at parts. I would say save your money or rent this to get some great sleep.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I Think the pieces could be larger other than it a OK game and maybe some difference patterns would be nice, more of a international them.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I loved the action and story. This was a great remake of  a classic movie. This is a must see for Total Recall fans.
1449415881|4.0|Dilbert fanatics are funny people. But the one we have is special breed.<br />He is unique and one of a kind, a Dilbert kind!  Ha-ha! :o)<br /><br />Pretty funny stuff when you think about it for a while. And a daily dose is perfectly wonderful!!!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Great action movie, but the story was a lacking substance. If you are in the mood for a shoot 'em up, then this is the movie for you.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|I had rented the first season from redbox and then realized it was a series so returned without viewing.  I bought the series and fell in love with Downton Abbey.  My Mom and I watched the entire series the weekend it arrived and hated when it ended.  Don't hesitate to buy from this seller....

B004H4XI5O|5.0|Josh Foer has really created a masterpiece with this book.  It is based on real world techniques that really do improve your memory access capabilities.  I got it because it got really good reviews, and when I was reading it, I couldn't pull myself away for more than a few minutes.
B000FBJG04|5.0|This is a must read for everyone. I think it should be mandatory for all high school students. It would remind them of the sacrifices of war.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I fell in love with this book 10  years ago, but recently picked it up again as I re-read Ender's Shadow.  Reading them side- by-side gave me new insight. It captured me a second time and I learned even more from it. Still a must read for anyone over the age of ten.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It isn't just the suspenseful writing and well-developed characters that we love but from the first page we are drawn to the overwhelming sense of dread from the moment Katniss' fingers seek her sister's to knowing that against the odds her sister will be chosen.  We all know this story.  It's the feeling of being controlled by powers that are unseen and unknowing but cruel and weirdly familiar in our world of dictators, gun violence and hate crimes committed against each other for just being different.  The book resonates with us because so often it feels like we're being ruled over by a bigger fish with more (more power, more wealth, more everything).  Right on Suzanne Collins for capturing our collective sense of dread while giving us hope through Katniss.
3795753384|5.0|I love this core because it's much easier to read than the individual part scores and it has the soloist music as well.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I was very young when \\"The Six Million Dollar Man\\" originally aired, so before the recent release of this show onto DVD (FINALLY) my memories were basically of bits and pieces, with no real memory of entire episodes (uh, except maybe the Big Foot eps that came later). On the one hand it's a shame this spectacular show was never syndicated (as least to my knowledge). That said, after purchasing season 1 it almost felt as if I was watching the series for the first time. There were scenes here and there that I recalled, but most surprising of all is how much I rediscovered my love for this series. Memories faded, I do remember loving this show as a young child. Now, as a middle aged adult, I seem to love it just as much. In fact, as mentioned in the title I chose for my review, this just might be the most FUN show ever created. I only wish I still had my Steve Austin doll since nowadays it's become quite an expensive collector's item. I loved everything about this series - all those years ago - and still do. Great casting! Great music! Great story lines!!! Great guest stars too!!!!<br /><br />But back to the series and season one. I can actually recall seeing commercial advertising for the series premiere, although I have no memory of there being 3 pilot episodes. The first pilot - aptly titled \\"The Six Million Dollar Man\\" - is without a doubt my favorite of the 3 as well as my favorite episode of season 1. Even if this series had never materialized beyond the initial pilot movie (I'm so thankful it did though), the original pilot movie could easily stand on it's own as a wonderful, engaging and very unique t.v. movie. I had forgotten that Richard Anderson and the Oscar Goldman character were not featured in this first pilot; so glad he showed up in the second as I loved the character of Oscar Goldman as much as I loved Steve Austin. In this initial pilot we see an ordinary man - with an extraordinary job (astronaut) - doing what he loves to do and ending up in what could only be described as a nightmarish freak accident. Colonel Austin loses his right arm in the crash, along with his left eye and both legs that are too badly damaged to salvage. When he eventually regains consciousness and is told by Dr Rudy Wells the extent of his injuries my heart breaks for the young pilot.  Lee Majors realistically portrays the emotions of a man whose life is now changed forever. While lying helplessly in a hospital bed, Steve is heartbroken, depressed and even attempts suicide. Lee's performance is so convincing that I was literally tearing up as I watched a pilot I had not seen since 1973. Lee continues to give a brilliant and convincing performance as a man who eventually accepts his fate, agrees to the bionic surgery and slowly regains his life. We watch Steve Austin passionately struggle to use his arm and legs the way a baby first learns to grasp objects and walk. Soon afterwards he is confronted by a government agency that has not only funded his $6,000,000 surgery but is now expecting payback in the form of expecting Colonel Austin to become a government special agent. We see Steve Austin struggle with yet another life-changing decision as he tells the man \\"I don't want to kill anyone.\\" So ladies .... he's not only an extremely handsome man, with a sense of humor and pleasant manner, who has been to hell and back - but also a man with high morals .... what more can any of us ask for, right? Ha!<br /><br />The 2nd and 3rd pilots are entertaining in their own way, both with a James Bond theme. Surpass it to say that this is not exactly the direction that the creators of the original pilot wanted the series to take, and hence after the 3rd pilot there is a noticeable change in the show's overall style. Gone is Steve Austin as James Bond; now it's Steve Austin as the astronaut turned government agent we came to initially know in the first pilot movie. There are 13 FUN episodes, in addition to the 3 movies. It's difficult to select a favorite episode or two, but if I had to choose I'd probably say \\"Population Zero\\" and \\"Dr Wells is Missing\\" would be at the top of my list. Even though Lee was initially worried that the series might prove to be too campy (ala the very campy Batman series), the camp factor for \\"The Six Million Dollar Man\\" was minimal compared with Batman. O.K., so in two of season 1 episodes we are asked to believe that a mad scientist can create robots that look and act human (Day of the Robot and Run Steve Run), but the remaining episodes are less campy. All of the episodes are FUN to watch. Looking forward to adding the rest of the series to my DVD collection. I have season 2 and am getting ready for the release of season 3 (next week) - Yahoo!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Long Live Steve Austin and Long Live The Six Million Dollar Man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This camera took a little bit to figure out.  The instructions were not terribly clear.  So since I wanted to send my daughter a picture of my new haircut it took a bit of playing with it.  I finally got the picture I wanted and was able to choose to send it via email, text or Skype - all of which I have on my Kindle Fire HD.  It worked and that's all I cared about.  I was even able to send it to my personal computer, via attaching it to an e-mail and save a copy of the picture there in my pictures folder.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I saw a few episodes of Fringe on a Science channel marathon and was hooked.  The \\"way out\\" fringe science is all too believable when explained by the \\"mad scientist\\" Walter Bishop who with his candor is very funny and entertaining... Plus Olivia is \\"hot\\" in a wholesome sort of way.  I consumed the next three full seasons of Fringe and now am in withdrawal mode.
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is the most AMAZING series on earth!!!  I couldn't put any of the books down... I would stay up late reading them, then wake up early to read them again.  I watched the movie after I read the books and the books are far better than the movie.  The beginning of the first book is kinda slow, but its because its working its way up to the good part (the rest of the series).  I've read all the books twice and have loved them both times.  I would really recommend these books to anyone who likes to read.  I hope you found my review helpful and wish \\"that the odds be ever in your favor.\\"
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|This is a good looking game.  It runs smoothly on my Droid DNA, which is worth noting since so many games just outright fail to work on it.  The graphics and animation are very nice looking and the style of animation is probably unlike any other popular game out there at the moment.  But as far as gameplay goes, it's only mildly fun.  It takes an Angry Birds-style approach to play, with each level consisting of dozens of sublevels that must be finished before advancing to the next major stage.  Side scroll action is not controllable which means pathway puzzles and earning points must be figured out on the go as the character walks at a set pace.  It's easy enough to figure out thanks to hints at the beginning of the game but I think it would get old real quick playing similar levels over and over.
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|I liked watching it again. Just as good as the first time I saw it. The special effects are very well done.
B009FXIICK|4.0|A variation on the match-3 games like Jewels and whatnot.  Seems to run pretty well on my Droid DNA, which can be finicky with games, so that's worth extra points.  I dig the drawing style, too.
B005KCGIUY|5.0|I'm a Maynard fan, and I really enjoyed \\"V\\" is for Vagina, so I had high hopes when I unwrapped this CD on Christmas day.  They were blown away.  It's a serious contender for my all-time favorite album.  So what makes it so good?<br /><br />First, the richly layered music.  If you're a fan, you know what I mean, but if you've only heard Tool or A Perfect Circle (older projects, same front man) on the radio, you MUST give a couple tracks a listen on good headphones.  Their music has a wealth of subtleties which are washed away in a car.  Consider \\"Oceans\\", which like APC's \\"The Noose\\" I can only describe as a blanket of music.<br /><br />Second, Maynard's vocals.  He's definitely mellowed, but that's only done good things to his voice.  His range covers his wistful to defiant lyrics beautifully.  It probably helps that Puscifer is his own project, so every word is personal.<br /><br />Third, the range of songs.  There's humor in the title track, reflection in \\"The Weaver\\", affection in \\"Oceans\\" and \\"Monsoons\\", and a Tool-like sense of danger in \\"Man Overboard\\" and \\"Toma\\".<br /><br />Compared to \\"V\\" Is for Vagina, this is Puscifer's grown up album.  The songs are less juvenile and less sexual; the common themes are growth and responsibility, facing both a life lived and the years yet to come.  Maynard has clearly moved past the frustration which powered Tool, but I'm not 22 anymore myself, so I can appreciate the change.  Teens who just discovered Tool a couple years ago may consider this CD dull in comparison - it's not meant for a mosh pit.<br /><br />As a specific example, \\"Tumbleweed\\" has themes of carrying on in adversity similar to \\"Momma Sed\\" from \\"V\\" is for Vagina.  But where the earlier track was quite bare, \\"Tumbleweed\\" has a background singer and additional layers in the music.  It's still a trip through a ghost town, but now you can hear the wind whistling in the warped boardwalk.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine Maynard topping this album, and if it neverhappens I'll be sad but content.  Much like these songs.
B005FLX1HS|3.0|I bought this right around the time Skrillex started to become a household name, which was about five minutes before it became the butt of every hipster's joke.  Taken outside the context of pop culture it's an OK set of songs with a noticeably different sound to current electronic or whatever else one might compare it to.  Skrillex is proof that anyone with Garage Band can become a successful musician, and also proof that not everyone with Garage Band deserves success.<br /><br />But if you're knee deep in the nowsphere, you either love it because you're a commercial exec looking for music to &#34;connect to youth buyers&#34; or you hate it because everyone else you know hates it and you're dying to be part of the in-crowd.  Either way, you're probably not wrong in your feelings.

B00005JKGZ|5.0|This movie is a good movie and among other things introduced The Trolley Song and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.Other songs which werent so popular are Over the Banister  Under  the Bamboo Tree Meet Me In St Lois which is obviously  to the name  of the movie  as well and the popular Skip To My Lou.Another one is The Boy Next Door. Judy Garlands  charactor as well  as her  older  sister have  a love interest. The movie takes place in the year  before  the  St Lois  worlds fair. One of  my favorite scenes is the  scene where Judy Garland  sings  Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas  to Margaret Obrian who plays her sad  younger sister  on Christmas  eve night introducing the song. Theres a lot of other  good scenes like when Judy  Garland has her love  interest escort  her  through the house to  turn the lights off after a party. This is my  favorite movie with Judy Garland in  it. Its a very good movie. You should see it.

1451627297|5.0|I used to buy Stephen King books quite often until they started publishing chapter books. This was a show stopper for me. Why would I want to she'll out that kind of money for so little at a time. I think this was about 10 to 15 years ago. Now to the present.... My wife bought Under the Dome. I read it and thought it was good.<br />I saw this book and kept putting off buying it. I know the depth Stephen King goes into his writing and I really did not want to invest my time read something I thought would be boring. No aliens, no demons, no supernatural angle.<br />Ok, I have to admit I could not be more in error. This is one of the best books I ever read. I did not want this story to end.<br />Thank you for writing  this and keep up the superior work...

The special features and deleted scenes are great and worth watching.

B00A2H9LK6|2.0|I'm a hard person to please when it comes to video game to movie adaptations.  There is little that impresses me.  That's why I stopped watching the Resident Evil movies when the second Resident Evil movie came out.  I bought this movie in hopes that it would be a lot better than the first film.  The first movie was decent but didn't have re-watchability.  When I watched this movie I was thoroughly disappointed in it.  Everyone I know told me it was a great movie.  I don't see it.<br /><br />First off.  The movie isn't dark enough.  In the games the environments are supposed to be pitch black.  You don't see that hardly at all in this movie.  The scares aren't good enough.  The only two things I enjoyed where the weird nurses and the pyramid head.  The pyramid head is above all my favorite monster from the Silent Hill franchise.<br /><br />Second of all.  The story line was boring.<br /><br />I was really hoping this movie was going to be great but I guess I was wrong.  But that's just my outlook on it.  You be the judge.  Happy watching!

B005LAIHE0|3.0|The Five-Year Engagement starring Jason Segal and Emily Blunt is one of those movies that are a little too long and have a weak start. The first 15 minutes of this film are pretty lame, after the couple move that's when the movie begins to get interesting and complicated. I felt this movie took forever to end especially for a romantic comedy. What saves this film from total disaster is the delightful and very talented Emily Blunt. It's pretty amazing how Blunt can make any average comedy seem slightly more entertaining. Segal co-wrote this film and his acting is not good (or his writing for that matter), I just can't take this guy seriously...he's just plain awkward and unlikable. This movie does have some funny moments but overall, it's a mixed bag for me.

0316223239|5.0|I had my reservations about this book but it hooked from the first page. The premise is simple: a young boy, the product of the abuse of his captive mother, only knows Room as all his world. Eventually, he and his mother leave the room and begin to become part of the rest of the world. Simple plot but incredible story.<br /><br />The narration from Jack's point of view works. He observes things but intelligent as he is, there are certain things that he does not understand. But you, the reader, are well-aware of the danger and desperation felt by his mother, the vileness of her abuser and the how limited his world is. That effect, that you are wiser than the young narrator, creates a creepy feeling. You know what is happening to his mother, her family even though he may not.<br /><br />The book left me stunned for days after I finished it. You just don't quite come out of the story without looking at the world in the same way.
0765325950|3.0|Rating: 6/10<br /><br />A Memory of Light is quite a good read and leaves me reasonably satisfied at the conclusion of an epic 14-book fantasy series that I have been reading for nearly 20 years.<br /><br />I know that \\"quite a good read\\" and \\"reasonably satisfied\\" sound like damning with faint praise, so let me clarify that I think Brandon Sanderson has done an amazing job with his contributions to the Wheel of Time series - it was a huge ask to pull that entire thing together even in 3 books and he's done a super job for the fans.<br /><br />Robert Jordan created an awe-inspiring world in writing Wheel of Time, and he also left a massive amount of plot lines to be resolved in the final books. Added to that he even wrote the entire epilogue of A Memory of Light ~7 years ago.<br /><br />With these restrictions and limitations for Sanderson to deal with, it's astonishing how well he did with the last three books.<br /><br />Even if Jordan could have finished it himself, with such a huge and complex series many readers did expect unanswered questions and I accepted that before reading. So why the faint praise? Here are some things that I take issue with in A Memory of Light.<br /><br />** spoiler alert **<br /><br />The rest of this review contains my thoughts on specific details in the book and contains spoilers.<br /><br />** spoiler alert **<br /><br />I thought that Mat would have more surprises to bring to bear in the battle, particularly towards the end - I was hoping for yet another trick up the sleeve that didn't turn up. Mat didn't seem to have quite the same level of strategy and battle knowledge he showed in other books - although, quite annoyingly, his fellow characters seemed to mention his tactical brilliance with every second breath.<br /><br />I wasn't mad about the Compulsion used on the great generals - surely they would be protected given that Tel'aran'rhiod is busier than a train station these days, and that we know about dream protection since Moiraine mentioned it all the way back when we started in book #1.<br /><br />It sounds like they had a lot of folks calling in sick when it actually came to Tarmon Gai'don. Where were the 2000-4000 Aiel channellers, the 1000+ Aes Sedai, the 1000+ Kin, and the thousands of Wind Finders? I expected massive circles of channellers wielding sa'angreal capable of killing the anticipated millions of Trollocs. Two hundred or more Black Ajah and a thousand Asha'man, many turned.<br /><br />The impression I got was of 20-30 Aes Sedai facing the enemy alongside Egwene. The location of thousands, if not tens of thousands of channellers is not something that we should be wondering about. What about the Green - the \\"Battle Ajah\\"? They escape mention at the Fields of Merrilor - were they off drinking tea and discussing braid tugging techniques because someone forgot to invite them to the Last Battle? I don't think so.<br /><br />We had loads of awesome uses of the power in Dumai's Wells - dome, exploding ground, headsplosions, etc - and at the manor house - death gates and all that. Where were these in the Last Battle?<br /><br />We know that only a 'remnant of a remnant' of the Aiel will survive, surely that means that several hundred thousand of them die in the Last Battle. Yet we get the impression of hundreds, perhaps in the low thousands, of Aiel moving around and fighting during the battle. Do they even get orders from Mat? I don't think so - please correct me if I'm missing something.<br /><br />Aside: I didn't like how the Aviendha's visions of the Aiel future seemed to be just written off. It felt like an editorial decision where either resolving this storyline would take too many pages -and requiring another book - or simply that the writing team felt that the deus ex machina resolution would satisfy readers.<br /><br />Logain, Morgase and Padan Fain were massively built up in early books as important characters with important roles. Logain was utterly disappointing to thepoint of arguably proving Min's visions incorrect - which they should never be. The Morgase and Fain cameos were slightly better in that the didn't deserve more than a couple of lines. Many other cameo appearances felt like just that - name drops rather than real important roles.<br /><br />Surely we could have got some preview of Shara's importance and role, rather than simply dropping them in for what seems like plot convenience. Jain Farstrider or Forsaken scenes could have given some more hints in earlier books.<br /><br />Speaking of plot convenience, the \\"plot armor\\" was particularly strong for major characters in the Last Battle - far more of them should have died. For the sake of anyone reading this accidentally, I won't mention names, but I felt they got off particularly lightly. And as for poor Bela - cruel, guys, cruel!<br /><br />We now know how Rand survives, taking over another body. This was a decision made by Jordan years ago but despite the hints that the two were connected, it does seem just a little bit too easy.<br /><br />I agree with those who compare it to a Gemmell-style rushed ending - the battle is still going and you're wondering how the book could possible end in a couple more pages. I think Jordan's prescribed epilogue is a strong factor in this - if Sanderson had some leeway to add to the epilogue I think that would have significantly helped.<br /><br />A note on the ebook: publication of the ebook version of A Memory of Light was deliberately delayed 4 months by Robert Jordan's wife, Harriet because she was concerned that the hardcover may not reach the top of the bestseller lists if purchases were divided between e-book and hardcover. She felt that this would harm her husband's legacy.<br /><br />I think that's a bloody stupid decision.<br /><br />In attempting to protect the legacy, this decision has actually harmed Jordan's legacy by preventing many loyal fans from getting a copy of the book in the format they want. What's happened now is that hundreds of readers have protested the decision by giving the book 1-star Amazon reviews - there are currently over 300 1-star reviews on Amazon.com. Some may argue that it is wrong to post a 1-star review on the book because the review is not for the correct version (you cannot review the ebook as it hasn't been released) or that a review is not the correct way to express anger and disappointment with the publishers (and Harriet), and that the complainants should write strongly worded letters to the publisher instead.<br /><br />My view on this is that the decision was taken to arbitrarily delay publishing the ebook in order to manipulate sales figures of the hardcover, and therefore having people express anger with this decision through online reviews is absolutely fair game. Those reviews will send the publishers a clear message about introducing arbitrary delays in the future.<br /><br />Overall, I felt A Memory of Light was pretty good. It didn't ruin the series, which is a real danger with final books, but it could have been significantly better too. There are points I've noted above that seem like lack of attention to detail, which was always one of Jordan's strongest points - to a fault, in fact. I'd have to conclude that they were missed by the writing & review team, or worse, noted and ignored.<br /><br />But in reviewing this book, I need to also look at where it came from, that it is the conclusion of an epic 14 book, 4 million word story, and that the author had 3rd party limitations and deadlines for an already difficult task. That gives it serious positive points in my count, enough to outweigh many of the negatives I've outlined above. In conclusion, I give A Memory of Light between a 6/10 or a 7/10 overall - the ebook fiasco tilts me clearly toward the 6.<br /><br />For some other reviews and further discussions about some of the issues I mentioned above see:<br /><br />3rd party commentary link removed<br />Amazon review link removed<br />3rd party commentary link removed<br /><br />Update: seems like Amazon only allow Amazon links in reviews.

B0084670FU|2.0|It was great for a Sunday nap. Maybe if I had seen the end I would have felt differently, but I'm not interested in trying again.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|just a plain fun game. one of the best games for the kindle fire out there possibly. just my two cents on it, but try it out
B00APJLX8E|4.0|It was a pretty cute movie. The hotel guests by far made the movie, and were better than the plot. But hey it's a kids movie. It had a sweet little lesson and was entertaining.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars because it keeps on freezing and crashing. Other wise great game! And it's free!
B0043UB0EI|4.0|I was loaned a copy of “Gods of the Arena” which I enjoyed. So I decided to look in n Season 1 of Spartacus. I've not been disappointed so far (I'm half way through it); and will most likely move on to season 2 & 3. There are minor goofs here and there bu they don't spoil anything. I find the dialogue interesting. Makes me wonder if it is historically accurate; its quite unlike any I remember from other shows of this AGE.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I like this game. It's a little hard at first but I got better.I guess I would recommend getting it. It's a lot of fun.  :)
B0034G4P80|4.0|Movie was really good!  Actor played the role of the iconic Viking God of Thunder very well and the movie was a combination of the comic book and norse myth.  It was a fun movie full of action, humor mixed in with sentimentality!
0393340244|2.0|I greatly enjoyed Cordelia Fine's previous book \\"A Mind of Its Own\\", which makes a convincing case for the huge role the subconscious mind plays in our lives. Of course the existence of the subconscious mind is not new information, and the book's primary achievement was the use of stories, anecdotes, examples and other rhetorical techniques to leave this reader completely convinced that it was not just other people whose subconscious minds rule their lives. The book was marred only by a number of strange comments about her husband, which I dismissed at the time.<br /><br />Now Cordelia Fine has directed her considerable persuasive skills to the task of casting doubt on a widely held belief: that in human beings, as with every other mammal species, the sexes are different in their mental makeups.<br /><br />Casting doubt is all she achieves. This book does not deliver \\"the real science behind sex differences\\" as the cover promises the reader. Ironically, the book does cast doubt on the author's objectivity in the matter. It rapidly becomes blatantly obvious that she is passionately committed to the cause of the \\"blank slate\\", though as an academic she is careful to fudge her words so that ultimately you cannot find a quote that actually says that this is what she thinks.<br /><br />The closest we get is in this quote: \\"Our minds, society and neurosexism create difference. Together, they wire gender. But the wiring is soft, not hard. It is flexible, malliable and changeable. And if we only believe this, it will continue to unravel.\\"  Note the complete absence of any acknowledgement of a possibility of inherent biological differences - they are not included in the list of things that \\"create gender\\".<br /><br />We see this passion in her stories of childhood rebellion against girly things, through to her constant use of sarcasm and ridicule, her use of thin and illigitimate arguments, and even her practice of changing the stories she reads to her children - to their great disapproval - so that the action heroes are girls, while the boys stay home to bake cakes and sew pretty clothes.<br /><br />The blank slate is the idea that men and women are born the same and it is only because society raises us differently that we turn out differently. The billions of receptors for sex hormones in the brain in the womb and after birth have, according to this theory, no influence on cognition or behaviour and peform no discernible function.<br /><br />Personal disclosure: I believed the blank slate theory when I was young, but over time I have been forced - reluctantly - to change my mind and accept that there are significant general differences. This is not to say that everyone born with a Y chromisome will be sterotypically male, and everyone who lacks one will be a classic lady. But a sound holistic statistical analysis shows very little overlap: probably in the range of 3-5% are not sex-typical. However it is clear that social influences are also very important. In fact the only people I have seen who are completely one-sided in this are the blank-slate believers.<br /><br />What I was hoping for in this book was a) a credible critique of the science of sex differences, and b) a solid theory of how the very different ways men and women think and behave come about. 300 pages later, I had neither of these.<br /><br />I will cover (b) first. There is not much to say. Fine's theory of how men and women end up different doesn't amount to a hill of beans. All we get are a number of vague hand waving arguments about how expectations influence people's behaviour and thinking. There is nothing solid or concrete that the reader can take away. How did David Reimer's parents somehow magically convince this boy, who was raised as a girl from 1 year old after a botched circumcision, to behave like a boy? How did they somehow communicate this to him so strongly that when he finally found out years later that he was really a teenage boy, everything suddenly made sense - why he did not fit it, why everyone regarded him as a strange girl, why he even preferred to urinate standing up like a boy? Fine merely implies they did it because they must have done it.  She rules out the possibility that David Reimer acted like a boy because he *was* a boy because she has no alternative, if she is to cling to her ideology of \\"no essential difference\\".<br /><br />The critique of sex difference research that is offered is longer, but not much better. Here we see the standard techniques of rhetoric employed, such as:<br /><br />* Dress up speculatation as fact (pp 94, 96, 128, 205 and many other instances).<br /><br />* Quote references to justify claims, when the references do not justify the claims made.  See reference 4 on page 92, and reference 14 on page 103 where mere opinion is quoted to justify a factual claim. Another reviewer has also pointed out instances of this. See http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LK3W2ENWP0DV/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393068382&linkCode=&nodeID=&ta=g.<br /><br />* Argument by doubt. We don't know exacly how something works, so it doesn't happen - p 104 Ref 19. On the next page we have a similar argument from complexity - the brain is complex, with \\"lots of unexplored territory\\" so really we can't believe that hormones influence behaviour.<br /><br />* Criticise the weaker argument, and ignore the stronger one. Thus we repeatedly see 17th and 18th century buffoons, and other non-scientists quoted on sex differences rather than best of breed contemporary researchers. Under this category you could also file the numerous instances of \\"making fun of the popular press\\". A lot of popular interpretations of science are simplistic, overreaching and so forth, but this is not a criticism of the underlying science.<br /><br />* Focus on \\"the doubt\\" and contradictions between studies. It is no secret that a lot of scientific research is inconlusive. Over time we muddle towards a true understanding. But Fine revels in the contradictory studies, without trying to work out what is really going on (e.g. p 129). As a tobacco company executive once wrote: \\"Doubt is our product\\".<br /><br />* Minimize statistical significance by taking one characteristic at a time. If you look just at one thing at a time, there is a considerable overlap between men and women, but when you take them all at once, the overlap almost completely disappears at only 3-5%.<br /><br />* Make a big fuss about small differences in studies where you agree with them (p 195) but dismiss larger differences as 'minor' when you don't like the answer.<br /><br />* Investigate any studies that contradict a pre-conceived notion carefully, looking for methodological issues. If they have any such issues, discount them. Studies that conform to a preconceived agenda are given a free pass however. In the whole book I did not see one criticism of a study that cast doubt on sex differences, but literally hundreds of criticsms of studies that went the other way.<br /><br />* Misrepresent your opponents and rush to find fault where it is not justified. See [...]<br />* Examine the numerous studies where the men and women were \\"set up\\" in such a way as to minimize sex differences. For example, the women are given an incentive to succeed and them men are now, or the men will be told discouraging things such as that women always do better at this task. When such a study shows reduced or no sex differences, conclude that the sex differences do not exist. Of course such studies only show that incentives and discouragement can affect people's performance. They do not show that underlying differences do not exist.<br /><br />In many ways this book resembles Steven Jay Gould's book \\"The Mismeasure of Man\\" in its tactics and in its ideological agenda.

B0058YPGSY|2.0|Seasons One was focused, exciting and kept me interested; Season Two drifted with the Irish Connection and the baby drama; Season Three got the club back in business, but Season Four has lost its way. The writers have exhausted their bag of trucks. This series has come to the traditioanl hollywood ending--about two seasons after they should have quit.

B005LAII3U|2.0|'Total Recall' does have great (if confusing) CGI, interesting art work, and a competent hard working cast. In all other aspects, the film is a failure.<br /><br />The 1990 version of 'Total Recall' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and directed by Paul Verhoeven and the 2012 version starrng Colin Farrell and directed by Len Wiseman both claim to be based on the Philip K. Dick short story 'We Can Remember it for You Wholesale'. Readers of Philip K. Dick will understand that the films are actually very  meagerly based on the original story. Of the two versions, the 1990 film tried to present the essense of Philip K. Dick's philosophy and thinking.  Verhoeven was interested in Philip K. Dick and used humor and absurdities to make the viewer question the reality of the story presented. He incorporated Dick's political views (libertarianism, anti-corporate culture, and the evils of big government) as well as Dick's metaphysical and religous views. He prompts the filmviewer to ask if Quaid's adventure is real or is it all imaginary as part of his altered memory? Did it actually happen or was it all an hallucination?<br /><br />The nature of reality was a major theme in much of Philip K. Dick's works: What is reality? Verhoeven constructed his film to force the viewer to consider this question. Dick incorporated his personal drug-induced hallucinations into his stories and was even diagnosed as schizophrenic at one time. Verhoeven directed his film to include how Philip K. Dick saw the world. Verhoeven concluded his film without answering the big question of whether or not the story was real or imaginary. However he does indicate in the film's ending  that perhaps it does not really matter.<br /><br />So on to the 2012 version.<br /><br />The 2012 version does not even try to reflect the original intent of the short story or the 1990 film. It is a rewrite filled with intense action sequences, lots of CGI, and little plot. Philip K. Dick's literary imprint is all but gone although a case can be made that the dystopian background story was extracted from a number of other works by the author. We are given fast edits and  impossible fight scenes. The action scenes are so quickly cut that the viewer is confused about what is actually happening.  The background art that depicts a generally decaying urban cutlure is also so busy in interesting detail that it contributes to the distraction to what should be the center of attention - the story.  The two female leads, Jessica Biel and Kate Beckingsale, look so much alike, with similar hair style, hair color, body builld and form fitting black outfits, that is is difficult to tell them apart. And lastly, the use of constant CGI lens flare, as used in the Star Trek re-boot, is often inappropriate and distracts from what you see on the screen.<br /><br />Perhaps the best piece of video on the entire DVD is one of the extras - Michio Kaku's featurette called 'Science Fiction vs Science Fact', which not only is fascinating by itself, but also give us a clue to understand why the film fails in the end. The film is not a Philip K. Dick exploration of reality but a vision of a dystopian science fiction future.<br /><br />Not recommended.
B005XI94HY|5.0|Music is often to referred to as magic and with the Ceremonials album I can't agree more.  I listen to a wide range of music from classical, new age, oldies, classic rock, soundtracks, techno, pretty much anything that has something that catches my ear.  There are a few though that you can listen to and all you want to do it play it over and over and crank it up louder each time. You truly feel this music (or maybe that's just the sound waves from having the volume at max...).<br /><br />I bought the deluxe version.  All the songs are well worth the extra money.  Not a bad song on the album.  I've listened to this album probably 10 times through since I bought it 2 days ago. The lead vocals are amazing and emotive.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

0385340540|3.0|Grisham is a fine, interesting writer and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the audio version of this book. Now Grisham is an expert at writing bestsellers so I was surprised by his indulgence or carelessness here, hence the three stars. There are pages where you'll think you picked up a textbook titled \\"Learning Italian.\\" Other pages give you a travelogue of Bologna. I thought stuff like this was supposed to be background not foreground in thrillers. Grisham's motivations are shaky. I was unconvinced America's top spymaster would park Blackman in Italy hoping to get him killed and so get some valuable information. That all those spy space spy satellites could be put up without the West knowing was a stretch. And Blackman's 20-year sentence was poorly backed up. After all, he was probably the most powerful lawyer in D.C. Guys like him go to country club jails and get out in a few years. I also wished Grisham could get beyond the thriller and move more into litarature. I wanted more of a morality tale, Blackman moving from money-grubbing and power brokering to a transformation into a real human being. Grisham hints at this but doesn't dramatize it. Still, if you love Italy and want to learn a 100 or more Italian words you'll love this book.

B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|This book is true to Jane Austen: elegant writing, engaging and lovable characters, and quick wit and humor. However, I would caution first-time Austen readers against Emma and more towards Pride and Prejudice - it is easy to give up on Emma if you're unused to Jane Austen and her writing style.

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This review is based on taking my family to see \\"Wreck-it Ralph\\" in the cinema in 3D.<br /><br />My 11 year old daughter summed this film up in the words \\"Tell them that it was really funny and very clever,\\" and for once her twin brother agreed with her, describing the film in one word, \\"Epic!\\" My wife and I also enjoyed the film which works on a lot of subtle levels.<br /><br />As in the original \\"[[ASIN:B004PYDA4A Tron (Original Classic) [1982] [DVD]]]\\" film, most of the characters are video game characters. The story is set in a games arcade, and \\"Wreck it Ralph\\" is the villain in the longest running game in the arcade, \\"Fix it Felix.\\" Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is the opponent who wrecks things: he has to try to knock down buildings faster than the hero of the game, Felix (voiced by Jack McBrayer), can mend them with his magic hammer.<br /><br />At the start of the film, Ralph is telling his story at a meeting of the support group for video game villains, \\"Bad Anon.\\" When the arcade is closed, the game isn't running and all the characters in the game are living their own secret lives in the same way that, for example, characters in the \\"[[ASIN:B005NI37C2 Toy Story (Blu-ray 3D)]]\\" films do when their kids are not around. Ralph is fed up with the fact that for thirty years he has not just been the villain in the game itself, but is treated like one by the \\"Niceland\\" characters when they're not all playing the game.<br /><br />At a party to celebrate thirty years of \\"Fix it Felix,\\" Ralph, provoked by one insult too many, vows that he will win a medal to prove that he can be a hero. So he visits a new game for older children/young adults, a first-person shooter called \\"Hero's Duty\\" where the good guys, under the command of the beautiful and very tough Sergeant Calhoun (voiced by Jane Lynch from \\"[[ASIN:B004D9FLJE Glee: The Complete First Season]]\\"), have to battle the evil Cy-Bugs.<br /><br />Ralph's quest for a medal takes him next to an racing arcade game for very small children called \\"Sugar Rush\\" where he meets the ruler of the game, \\"King Candy\\" voiced by Alan Tudyk (Wash from \\"[[ASIN:B000BLJGBC Serenity [DVD] [2005]]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B0001B3YTM Firefly - The Complete Series [DVD] [2003]]] and Sonny in \\"[[ASIN:B0013Z5BBY I, Robot [Blu-ray] (2004)]].\\") Here Ralph runs afoul of a charming little girl called Vanellope who wants to take part in the race but is banned from doing so because she is regarded by the other characters as a \\"glitch\\" or mistake in the game's programming.<br /><br />But there are several things which are amiss in the world of \\"Sugar Rush.\\" Ralph's attempts to gain a medal have unwittingly threatened the existence of his own game and several others, if not the entire arcade.<br /><br />King Candy warns Ralph that his actions could easily result in the customers reporting that \\"Sugar Rush\\" has a fault, which might possibly lead to the closure of the game. Ralph's absence has forced the arcade's owner to declare the \\"Fix It Felix\\" game out of order because when Ralph is not there to knock holes in the buildings, Felix has nothing to fix. To avert the permanent closure of the game, Felix comes looking for him, joined by Sergeant Calhoun, who realises that Ralph has unwittingly unleashed the most serious threat of all, one which could easily destroy first the game and world of \\"Sugar Rush\\" and then go on to threaten every character and game in the arcade.<br /><br />Two of these threats are genuine, the third is a plausible and clever trick. In the process of defeating the real threats, Ralph has to learn what is really required of a true hero ...<br /><br />All the best family films work on more than one level, with one set of jokes and challenges to entertain the kids and another set for the grown ups. This film managed this far better than most. Several of the characters in the game - particularly Sergeant Calhoun but she's not the only one - manage to have a dual focus. Calhoun is  simultaneously steeped in the tragic backstory of the game, which is completely real to her, making her intensely dedicated to stopping the deadly menace of the \\"Cy-bugs\\" she is fighting, and yet also well aware that her world is a game which must be made entertaining to the customers so they will keep playing it and that world will not be switched off by the arcade management. One of the iconic exchanges in the film is when she asks Wreck-it Ralph,<br /><br />\\"Do you know what the first rule of Hero's Duty is, soldier?\\"<br /><br />When Ralph replies \\"No cuts, no buts, no coconuts?\\"<br /><br />she icily informs him that the correct answer is that you do NOT \\"interfere with the first person shooter\\" (e.g. you don't get the player \\"killed.\\")<br /><br />The way in which characters in games written for players of very different ages interacted was brilliantly done, and the film made you care about the characters to a far greater degree than I would have thought possible. There were also a great many moments which were laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />We're so used these days to seeing fantasy worlds brought to life in a way which looks real that we rarely notice it, but the quality of the visual effects in this film was excellent.<br /><br />I can recommend this film as a treat for kids of all ages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! I just wish it was easier to get more jems! D: other than that, no complaints! :D
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much and was glad there were more to follow. It seemed like it was over to fast.
B0084670FU|5.0|A riveting sequences of events will keep you guessing until the end how all the stories conclude and are all based on one act of gratitude.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|This movie had unnecessary nudity, drinking, smoking, up-close drug use, and numerous uses of the f-word, and that was just the first 5 minutes. There was PROLIFIC use of the f-word (52, according to imdb) and lots of other foul language.<br /><br />There were about 10 minutes of exciting flying in the plane, and the rest of the 2 hour 13 minute movie was an utter waste of time. Most of the story dealt with what a drunk and drug user Denzel's character was, and in the last 10 minutes or so there was a lame redemption of sorts that didn't make much sense. My husband and I looked at each other like, \\"THAT's what we watched this whole stinking movie for?\\"<br /><br />There was close-up nudity, close-up use of cocaine and heroine, tons of totally unnecessary cussing, and general depravity during almost the whole movie. If you enjoy that kind of stuff, then rent this movie. If, however, you thought this was going to be an uplifting movie that lived up to the standards you thought Denzel Washington usually upheld, don't waste your time. There is no way I would watch this movie again, even if it was free. I felt like I needed to wash out my brain.<br /><br />In addition to the \\"redemption\\" moment at the end being \\"too little, too late\\", it didn't make any sense when you considered the rest of the story. The main character was a drunk who used cocaine to \\"get himself straight\\" enough to fly while he was still drunk. He partied all night with a woman who apparently meant nothing to him, based on the fact that he took the news of her death with no emotion and quickly moved on to another. He lied throughout the whole movie and at the NTSB hearing about being an alcoholic, and about being drunk and high when he flew that flight. He lied about knowing the woman outside of work.<br /><br />*SPOILER* Then he was asked a question to which he didn't even have to lie, a question that would decide his fate - heroism or jail. The question was, \\"In your opinion, did Katerina Marquez (theflight attendant with whom he partied, who died in the crash) drink those two bottles of vodka (that were found in the plane's trash)?\\"<br /><br />He's a liar. He is, in his own words, very good at it. He's the pilot who flew a horribly difficult flight that ended in a crash, so he was more than a little busy. He didn't even have to lie in this instance. Here are a few possible answers (in addition to the \\"I don't recall\\" that his lawyer fed him before the hearing): \\"I have no idea.\\" \\"I'm the pilot, not a stewardess. I don't know what Ms. Marquez was drinking.\\" \\"I didn't see her much during the flight.\\" \\"I really had my hands full with flying a damaged plane.\\"<br /><br />In addition, while he was taking sips of water and asking to have the question repeated four times, surely his bulldog of a lawyer would have objected to their asking the pilot if, \\"in his opinion\\", a flight attendant drank any vodka.<br /><br />In the end, this drunk liar chose to say that he drank the vodka? I don't buy it. And I certainly wouldn't buy this movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I haven't gotten a chance to play the whole thing but what I've done so far is a challange. My grandson will love to play it too. He is the one who got me started on the first Temple Run.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much it's just like temple run but better you are in the subway station and being chased by a cop and there dog I recommend this game to you
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it ca  be a little challenging later on if you do  want to spend any realworld money but its a great game
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a wonderful show!  I received the item within in the time frame stated.  Would have loved to have gotten it earlier.  I had a downton abbey marathon when I received it  I would highly recommend it!
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Unique look into communist Russia- well written and somewhat captivating mystery. the insight into the Russian State and  tyranny was fascinating. iI recommend this book to anyone who has bought into the notion that socialism is viable for America- this is where it can lead.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have season 1,2 and now 3!  I am now anxiously waiting for season 4!!!!!  I would highly recommend this!
B004LLDN3A|5.0|I CHOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE IT WAS A JOY TO SEE, I MEAN I HAVEN'T THIS MOVIE IN YEARS SO WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND LOOKED IT UP ON AMAZON; IT WAS TOTALLY A JOY AND A TREAT SINCE I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MANY YEARS AGO. IT ALL SUMS UP TO SAYING &#34;THANK YOU AMAZON FOR POSTING A CLASSIC DISNEY MOVIE FOR ALL THE KIDS IN ALL OF US ADULTS :-).<br /><br />YES, I WOULD RECOMMENDTHIS MOVIE FOR ANY UPLIFTING MOOD THAT I PERSON IS IN HAVING BECAUSE IT BRINGS BACK THE FAMOUS SONGS, DANCE MOVES, AND FANTASIES OF WHAT A NANNY COULD BE LIKE FOR JUST THAT MOMENT IN TIME.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan is a great singer and has a beautiful voice. This was a great purchas and I look forward to finding more music like it.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I needed something to put my laptop, diagnostic cables and a few papers in for my work. Looked at case style but felt I couldn't keep stuff seperated well enough. Has worked out great so far.
0765325950|5.0|This final book was masterfully written by Sanderson in how he highlights an authentic Robert Jordan voice. When Sanderson first took over, the two author's voices were apparent, the next book improved, while this final book, which wraps up all the story threads in a satisfying manner, sounds like Jordan penned the whole thing himself. This book has great fighting, interesting dialogue, funny moments and great final memories.
B000LTAY1U|2.0|I don't like the fact that I have to wear it all the time. I had to reset and wind it after about 20 hours of setting still. Stick with a battery watch. That,s why the price was so low for a seiko.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Combine a chilling tale of murder and sibling rivalry against the backdrop of Stalinist Russia.  Come on...I read &#34;The Secret Speech&#34; first, but out of order each novel in the trilogy stands alone as a solid read.
1416955070|4.0|I was a little skeptical when I picked up this book. I don't have a lot of patience for YA, and I'm still hurting from the disappointment that was Twilight. But a good friend told me I just had to read it, and I'm glad I did. It's undeniably an easy read, but that in no way detracts from the story. Some plot twists are predictable, some are not, but for the most part, for me, they hit that sweet spot of \\"I figured it out just three pages before the characters did\\" which is exactly what I love. Yes, there are occasional YA moments (why the heck are you worried about who you're going to date when the WORLD IS ENDING) but let's face it, we were like that in high school too. I forgive Clary for her occasional damsel in distress act because, often enough, the guys are in distress too. Overall her character is strong enough that I simply didn't mind.<br /><br />TL;DR - I devoured this trilogy and can't wait to grab the next.
B008I43DYU|3.0|It works. That's about all I can say about this. It doesn't have any outstanding features. If you need it, this app will work.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Like most dads everywhere, Dracula only wants to protect his daughter from the mean, cruel world, especially humans. So he comes up with an idea to build a hotel only for monsters, and it is a success. Like some dads too, who won’t let their daughters date until they are 30, this one isn’t up to her dating until at least 118, or probably older. Only problem is, for her birthday, she meets the enemy, and dad only wants to get rid of him, which he does. But she’s unhappy, and he can’t stand to see her miserable, so he gets him to come back. Family friendly (some children will really love the monster antics), and there’s a lesson in how to let go of your children in there somewhere! Really liked it—good feelings! Light-hearted and fun.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I wouldn't even give it 1 star but that's the only way you can write a review. Save you're $5. DO NOT BUY THIS!
B000P6PVLC|1.0|movie has no point and doesnt really even end. plus all of the events that take place are unrealistic. dumb movie
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great ending, but a tease from Christian's view at the end. Wish I had all the time in the world to finish reading from his point of view.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This is my new favorite album!  These guys bring back some aspects of a classic sound (does anyone else think of Queen when listening to these guys?), plus adding their own twist (a bit of electronica, hip-hop...).  I love this music!
1451695195|5.0|It's a mind-changing, as well as, life-changing, book to read. It doesn't give all the answers, but certainly makes one realize that some answers can only be found within and cannot be worded by the external reality. Love is the true answer!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Was very easy to learn how to play on the Kindle, with arthiritess can no longer shuffle a deck of cards
B007REV4YI|5.0|It was a long four years but the wait paid off. Skyfall is everything I love and expect in a Bond film: great action sequences, witty dialogue, exotic locations, and an engrossing story for a template. This continues the tradition of grittier films set in motion by Casino Royale and once again Daniel Craig doesn't disappoint, giving a great performance, as does everyone else. There were a few twists and surprises that I didn't see coming and the ending was very satisfying, especially as a lifelong 007 fan.<br /><br />Plus, the DB5 makes its return, complete with all of the classic Goldfinger attachments. How can you not love that?
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use it when I travel and at home. Easy to use. Easy to set. Easy to edit. Works GREAT!
0385363133|5.0|I thought these books were awesome, hot, erotic and romantic all wrapped up into one....Porn????  Not in my opinion but then again everyone has their own idea on that subject...I am going to read this series again, I was so depressed when it ended...She needs to do another series similar to this one
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Definitely had a nice unexpected twist at the end, Nicholas sparks always comes through with his southern romantic charming self
B004JN1D2I|5.0|THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I COULD HARDLY BUT THIS DOWN. ALONG WITH OTHER TIMES OF YELLING AT THE AUTHOR FOR WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO ALL THE CHARACTERS. I KNOW THIS ONE WILL BE READ AGAIN MANY TIMES.
