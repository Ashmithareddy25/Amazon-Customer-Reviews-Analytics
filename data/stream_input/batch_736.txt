B000JIHP88|5.0|When I bought this I was somewhat hesitant for 2 reasons- it's high price & because I really wanted one with bold primary colors.  At the time all the mobiles I saw for sale we pastel with \\"critters\\" that faced up (baby sees bottom only) & were strictly wind up.    We use this mobile on our baby's bassinet.  The way it attaches may limit what it can be attached to.  My husband had a hard time getting it on securely.  Eventually he was successful.    We use this item throughout the day every day.  Our 9 week old loves it.  The mobile circulates as most do; however, this mobile has additional movement as the leaves go up and down.  This is eye catching for the infant.  Also- if you turn it off while the leaves are in the down position it makes it very compact.    The base which attaches to the crib is bulky.  It has a light, also eye catching, & sounds.  There are 4 different sounds.  One of which is a soothing jungle background (others are Midi type music).  Our infant enjoys this because it has an interesting monkey call.  If the room you are using this mobile in has any background noise the mobile seems too quiet even on the loudest setting.  In a quiet room the loudest setting seems loud (the lowest is fine).  You have the ability to turn the light on or off.  The same for the music.    The battery life seems to be good on this item.  It has an auto shut off feature that can be your friend or foe.  It saves you in batteries but can upset a child engaged in it's movements!  Luckily it has a remote you can use to quickly turn it back on (though it never seems to be near when I am busy)!    To my surprise - it was worth the money.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Don't listen to the naysayers. This album is everything Tremonti has touted in his various interviews. It is truly a great great album. Yes, it is very heavy and reminiscent of some of Tremonti's influences. It is actually much better than anything in the Creed catalogue. Myles' singing is spectacular and the rhythm section is arguably the best in rock today. What more can I say? It is just a great, album. It has secured a place in my car cd-player for the last month! And I'm usually one who rotates the playlist like a fiend. It is really that good! Buy it!!
0810993139|5.0|I personally did not read this, SO I cannot tell you the plot line or anything else. However, what I do know is that my nephew --who is not a fan of reading-- got this book and did not want to put it down until he finished it.  To me this is all I need to know in order to suggest to other parents --especially those who find it difficult to get their children to read-- to pick it up.  Anything that gets children interested in reading is a great thing -perhaps that is the English teacher in me- and this is an easy way to do it. I have pre-ordered Kinney's second book for my nephew.
1881273156|5.0|Gary Chapman, author of \\"The Five Love Languages\\" (for couples), is a   very intuitive person and seems to have the ability to provide advice   without sounding or coming across as arrogant. The Five Love Languages   is a great book to read even if there are no issues going on in your   relationship. It is a refreshing look into how you can better yourself   as a part of a relationship and also help with learning more about what   your partner wants. Chapman leaves a gray area for couples to apply   their own ideas and helps them to create their own love language. I   think this book is well geared toward helping couples with their issues   as well as helping them learn to create new solutions themselves. I   highly recommend this book and feel that it is well worth the read. NJP
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|There's been many a good review on this calculator previously on Amazon so I won't delve too deeply into what has already been said.  I will, however, off a few opinions that are gleaned fromm over two decades worth of using financial calculators, so I hope someone finds this interesting.    First, there are only three 'true' manufacturers of financial calculators: HP, Texas Instruments and Calculated Industries.  Well, four if you count everyone else.  But, HP & TI own the student and financial market.  TI's calculators use the Algebraic Operating System (AOS) and HP uses RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) and some (the HP-12c platinum reviewed here) offer both.  It's a matter of personal choice; RPN is more fluid once you learn it, but AOS is easier and flows math as you were taught in school.  That said, once you master RPN, you won't go back to AOS.    Secondly, and this is my big beef with ALL calculator manufacturers.  Handheld calculators need TACTILE feedback; meaning, notably, that you have to both KNOW when you press a button and, also, KNOW that when you do, it registers and doesn't do something funky (i.e. NOT register or DOUBLE register).  This is beyond important and frequently overlooked by engineering types designing these calculators.  Face it, a financial calculator isn't mainstream and it isn't used for insignificant calculations; they're used by investment bankers, accountants, analysts, etc. and these people have to be comfortable in the fact that the buttons 'work' and work everytime.    No one, not a single manufacturer, understood this except HP.  And HP understood it to the point that their products were in a class by themselves.  That was until about five years ago.  Then, HP moved calculator production to China and the first products, notably the HP-12C Platinum and the HP 17BII+ suffered horribly in the hands of users because the tactile response simply was awful.  Read the Amazon reviews on these products to get a feel for what I'm talking about here.  I have a 17BII+ (2006 production) and call attest that if you don't watch it, it will frequently not register a number.  That's useless in a financial calculator.    Fortunately, HP in this latest 25th Anniversary Edition apparently listed to consumers and got 'most-of-it' right on this model.  Certainly better than the HP-12C Platinum and arguably better than it's more expensive sibling, the 17BII+.    Here, in no particular order is my Good/Bad list of features:    Good    Follows typical 12C keyboard layout and convention.  The 12C is THE standard in financial calculators and HP wisely left the form factor alone.    Faster than the original 12 and Platinum editions that followed.  By HP's literature, almost 6x faster, but the big deal here is that it is faster than the horrible Platinum 1.0 version which suffered in TVM calculations.    Re-designed battery door.  If you used an original 12C, you'll like the honking big door on this version.    VERY sweet rear labeling of functions; the metal decal attached on the back really goes a long way towards helping one with the keystroke/feature set of this calculator.    Runtime is just insanely long, which is useful since it uses non-standard batteries (CR2032's--better buy 'em now; you WON'T find them when you need them!)    Bad    Tactile response.  Yes, it's better than the 17BII+ (much!) but it still isn't in the same league as the older US or Singapore produced calculators of the 1980's and 1990's.  Arguably better than a 'cheapie' calculator but not what I would call 'good' by $50+ product standards.  Honestly, I cannot fathom why HP won't belly to the bar on this and just spend $5.00 more and put a better keyboard on their high-end calculators.  I will say this keyboard is the BEST keyboard HP has in their calculator product line, PERIOD.  But that's not as big a compliment as it sounds.    Build-quality.  Good.  Not great, good.  The thing still feels flimsy compared to the older products, plain and simple.      Case.  Know what?  On the web, that leather case looks very cool.  In real life, it's three times bigger than the calculator and twice as hard to carry.  A simple leather slip case would be nice.    Other odds and ends.      HP's manual for this baby is honestly worth the price of the calculator; maybe more.  One thing I'll have to give HP is at least in this day and age of PDFs and web searches, they still give you an honest-to-goodness manual and a good one to boot.  Kudos to them for that one!    As it stands, this HP 12C 25th Anniversary Edition stands as my pick of the absolute best available financial calculator on the market today.  I say that because it's better built than it's bigger brother (17BII+) and offers RPN and programming and a familiar keyboard and layout.      However, I wish HP senior staff would puruse these reviews and take heart to producing a calculator with 1980's build quality and 2007 microprocessor guts.  I mean honestly, I have a Blackberry with a 2GB memory card; and this thing has 28K?  It runs on the 6502 processor; does that ring a bell with anyone over 40?  It was the processor in the original Apple II!!!!  Why not:    >Build the case out of higher quality plastic?  Maybe ABS.  >Use a modern processor.  >Give us a removeable memory stick.  >Give it a USB port for programming.    That CANNOT be that big of a deal to incorporate and HP would OWN the calculator market again.    That's my .02 cents worth on the HP-12C, 25th Anniversary Edition.
B000W0DFDM|4.0|I liked reading this book alot. The key to getting something out of   this book is to read it with an open mind. Having this book written by   Behrendt you get the male perspective on things which is nice. I   thought the check lists after each chapter were helpful because it   reinforces what you just learned. This book I would say is   appropriate for women in their twenties who have not been in long-term   committed relationship. I think there are enough examples in this book   for everyone to get something out of it. What I took away from the book   is that life is short and there are many more fish in the sea. If the   guy you are dating is not really making an effort to show you he's   truly interested then he's just not that into you.  JDG
B000UBMWG4|5.0|The Final Cut is very clean, fixed-up, and almost sterile, like the lab room where a deranged scientist operates on macaques.<br /><br />I spent about 9 hours yesterday watching the Final Cut, some documentaries, the Workprint, and flipping back and forth on the US and the International theatrical releases.<br /><br />All together this is an excellent set. I noticed some of what looks like cross-frame contamination on the Workprint. The US and the International cuts look ok. I have yet to watch the 1992 director's cut.<br /><br />I like the Final Cut, and I like that I have the choice of other cuts to watch.<br /><br />Monumental movie, great stuff, highly recommended.
1594489505|5.0|I could not put this book down!  I did not have to read his first book \\"Kite Runner\\" in order to understand \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\".  It is wonderfully written and you can visualize everything that is happening. The characters come alive as you read about them.  I thoroughly enjoyed this story and highly recommend this book.
B000Z0OX9O|2.0|Bottom line: Disc 2, having many cues from the original score and NO voiceover, is a gem.  Disc 3, in my own opinion, is a waste.  If I wanted to hear new Vangelis music, and I don't, I'd rather buy it separately. And as we all know by now, Disc 1 is a re-release of the original '94 soundtrack, ruined with voiceover.  Guys, if I wanted dialog in my music, I'd be watching the movie for cryin' out loud.  Why not take advantage of the opportunity now to remove the voiceover and remaster it as music only? There are only a few cues on here that are both from the film and have no v/o, and since I already bought this in '94, I don't need it again. What is even more of a let down is that \\"Tears in Rain\\" is presented at the end of Disc 2 under a different title.  No Rutger Hauer voiceover this time, yet it has been ruined AGAIN with the addition of heavy wind sounds over the music. A very disappointing and confused representation of this beautiful score. Whomever is/are behind the concept of this 3 disc set should be ashamed.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|If you have the means to afford the deluxe edition, go ahead.  I read the reviews here when Help! was released that the Deluxe edition charged too much extra money for the books, poster, and theater cards.  I took the plunge anyway.  They're probably right that those materials aren't worth the extra $80, but I let myself enjoy the whole package.  I read along with the script, I enjoyed the picture book. The book shelf packaging looks nice on the shelf.  If you can't afford it or you view these things as a value proposition, get the movie only for $20.  If you go Deluxe like I did, once I made the decision to buy, I was going to enjoy it and not ever think about the price again.  Go for it!
B000641ZA4|5.0|I see that some people had a beef with this video, but I have to tell you, as a 33 year Genesis fan and having had the luxury of seeing them and Phil over 15 times in those years, this video collection took me back to the days of seeing them in very small halls and watching them become one of the biggest bands in history!      The videos were a nice selection of Genesis songs and I was thrilled to see \\"Ripples\\" and \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" on the video.  Could it have been better... yes... but not by much in my opinion.  I think some people forget that the technology back then was not what it is today but I found both the sound and the picture quality to be quite good.    I was very, very happy to get this video and I wouldn't part with it for anything... especially after just seeing them again for their last World Tour... why wouldn't any Genesis fan want to have this as a part of their collection?    So for anyone sitting on the fence, buy it.  You won't be disappointed... I know I wasn't.
B000N3ST7K|3.0|I support the general comments made so far.  I did the same as another reviewer - thought maybe different sets of speakers would sound better so played the CD on several systems.  Tarantino's music selection, as usual, is excellent, however the actual quality of the tracks is inconsistent.  Also, did not care for the choice of dialogues; they were not unique/distinctive enough to highlight.
B000002NZO|5.0|For anyone who isn't familiar with Genesis' early stuff... this CD is a must have.  To hear Peter Gabriel's heart-wrenching, soulful sound is quite extraordinary.  No Genesis library is complete without their early stuff and Trespass is NO exception.  Only six songs on the CD, but each song is a treasure.<br /><br />You could hear even then, that they would be HUGE!  The talented artists who put together this album may not have all made it into Genesis' later recordings, but this one in my opinion, is a classic!<br /><br />I still get shivers when I hear Peter opening on \\"Looking For Someone\\" and \\"Visions of Angels\\".  In my opinion, two of the prettiest melodies ever produced by Genesis.<br /><br />I know this is the album that did it for me all those years ago... one listen and I was hooked.  A fan for LIFE!
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I found this to bea fun and new story line that's aimed at adults as well as kids. As ananimtor myself I'm alaways looking for something new in animation in the story telling more then in the animation itself. Ratatouille serves up a delightful story and cast of characters while offering up several messages as dessert!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of animation as well as anyone looking for good entertainment for the whole family! Pixar has done it again as the best in animation bar none!!!!
6304711905|4.0|So, I just watched Tombstone for about the tenth time, and every time I see it, I'm overwhelmed by Kilmer's performance. I'm not a huge fan of westerns, but Val Kilmer makes this movie wildly entertaining. To this day, I've wondered who he irritated in Hollywood to result in his not getting nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar for this role. \\"You're not wearing a bustle. How lewd...\\"<br /><br />Get it. You'll really like it.<br /><br />It would have garnered five stars, but there are some scenes that just lagged. Overall, tho', the acting is top notch.
B0008ENICU|4.0|Being a huge fan of the stage play by the same name,the movie version is equal in it's fun and wit! If for nothing else, the fashion show (in color in a black and white film)is worth the price of this DVD! Ms. Russell and Ms Crawford are at their best as well as the rest of the cast. At times the script seems hokey and dated, but that adds to the charm and period in which this film was made.  This is a must have for anyone who has close friends that they love and hate at the same time!!! This is camp at it's best without being campy.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|The film's quality has been improved all around. The picture resolution is enhanced, the color is enhanced, the sound track is enhanced, frames were added to many scenes, and some scenes were added. I can hear every word spoken and every musical note in the sound track, and I can see more in the film than ever before. Every fan of this film will be delighted. And the additional features are great; good commentaries, a very good documentary, and more.    If you're a Blade Runner fan, get it!
B000XCZGVI|1.0|This is perhaps the worst movie that I have ever had the displeasure to watch. The script is erratic, if indeed this monstrosity was filmed using a script. For example, there appear to be two, mutually exclusive, endings to the film. One is left wondering why the first is included. Also, the film seemingly never ends -- it wanders aimlessly for hours.    The quality of the cinematography is terrible. The camera is more often out of focus than in. The color is terrible and the sound simply is not there.    Save your money, time and sanity. Just say no.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|\\"I don't blame my foster parents for that. Harry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me. But, they're both dead now. No, I didn't kill them. Honest.\\"<br /><br />At first I thought Dexter was creepy. At first I didn't (want to) understand him or his \\"Dark Passenger.\\" But even if you don't like him, Dexter's humor and personality (or is it faking personality?) quickly win you over until you empathize with his struggle and, dare I say, cheer on his macabre effort to rid Miami of pedophiles and murderers.<br /><br />\\"Needless to say I have some unusual habits, yet all these socially acceptable people can't wait to pick up hammers and smash their food to bits. Normal people are so hostile.\\"<br /><br />What I love so much about this show is how, instead of just showing views of murder from a \\"normal person's\\" perspective, you get inside the mind of a killer (who, no matter how much he tries to deny, has a strong moral code- he only kills those who have escaped the justice system).<br />You feel Dexter's struggle, are disturbed by his supposed lack of humanity, and accept his method of \\"cleansing\\" because of his intentions<br />(it's no wonder Michael C. Hall is nominated for a Golden Globe for best actor!)<br /><br />The show does not apologize for its honest portrayal of how monstrous humans can be. It doesn't sugar-coat how grotesque the (anti)hero's job is. But at the same time, it has wit, heart (Dexter's girlfriend and her children add warmth and sweetness), and a twisted charm.<br /><br />Truth, morality (is he a good person doing bad things, or a bad person helping the city by killing?), what family really means (relationships, not blood), and the value of human life are at the heart of this dark and complex series.<br /><br />For those that can handle the blood splatter and cop language- you aren't wasting your money.<br /><br />5 stars.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|Now, I'm not a Sweeney Todd devotee by any means. I've tried, on several occasions, to watch the Angela Lansbury and George Hearns version of the musical that I actually own on DVD, but haven't been able to finish it. I heard the recent B'way incantation was a brilliant revisioning of the musical, but I haven't seen it. So, when the critics began to rant and rave about this blood thirsty musical, I had my reservations, but I went. And was a visual feast for the eyes and imagination it was.<br /><br />Sweeney Todd tells the story of \\"The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\", who kills people in his life that do him wrong, and to dispose of them, uses the wiles of Mrs.Lovett, pie maker, all in the hopes of winning back his daughter, the beautiful Johanna.<br /><br />Tim Burton's vision of Sweeney is definitely right out of his playbook. London, set in the world of blacks and greys, make for an impressive visual palette for the blood-letting to come. Taking pages out of \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"Corpse Bride\\", Burton uses similar scenes and sets to give the dreariness of London particular finesse. In fact, because I am fairly recent fans of those two animated movies, I appreciated Sweeney's look even more.<br /><br />However, there are so many people that populate these sets that are breathtaking. First, the impressive Johnny Depp, playing Sweeney with such despair and fierceness that I'm ready to hand him his long overdue Academy Award right now. Comparing this performance, which hangs with depression and sadness,  with the light hearted frivolity of Captain Jack Sparrow, you understand the range of acting only this man can produce. This movie without Depp would be a definite different flick. And the impressive talents of Burton's wife, Helena Bonham Carter, plays Lovett with such style that I began to see her in a different way than Lansbury's Lovett. Both of their singing is very natural, not B'way or staged, but from themselves and their characters, and the effect is amazing.<br /><br />Sweeney Todd probably isn't for everyone, but I suspect that musical fans, Sondheim fans, Burton fans, and Anglophiles all will adore this adaptation. I did. It's odd Christmas fare, but floats easily in the sea of fine films that seem to besiege us every holiday season. Sweeney Todd is one of them, for sure.ney Todd probably isn't for everyone, but I suspect that musical fans, Sondheim fans, Burton fans, and Anglophiles all will adore this adaptation. I did.

B000TLTUL0|4.0|\\"Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.\\"<br /><br />The sign above the Gate of Hell in Dante's \\"Inferno\\" could serve as an onscreen prologue in Tim Burton's film version of Stephen Sondheim's 1979 musical thriller SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET.<br /><br />The world of Sweeney as designed by art director Dante Ferretti (\\"Gangs of New York\\"; \\"Cold Mountain\\") is a nineteenth century London of oily grime and even oilier morals. It's as if the entire movie has been dipped in grease and oil.<br /><br />This is appropriate. The Industrial Revolution brought wealth to those above, but dehumanizing working conditions, poverty and desperation to those below.<br /><br />The musical--Sondheim has called it \\"black operetta\\"-- opened on Broadway in 1979. When the \\"blood\\" began to flow, many first-nighters walked out of the Uris Theater, horrified that a musical would take as its subject throat-slashing, cannibalism, and, on the periphery, pedophilia.<br /><br />But maybe Sweeney's time as a film has finally come. Today's audiences--prepared (desensitized?) by reports on the nightly news of Jeffrey Dahmer and other serial killers and the priest/pedophile scandal in the Catholic Church--may have the sense of having seen this before.<br /><br />Maybe they have, but never so entertainingly and with such beautiful music underscoring each violent slash of Sweeney's razor of chased silver.<br /><br />Guiding this sanguinary mayhem is director Tim Burton, who, with his alter ego Johnny Depp (Sweeney) and his wife, Helena Bonham-Carter (Mrs. Lovett) splashes across the screen a tale of injustice, unrequited love, but most of all revenge.<br /><br />Some admirers of the original Broadway version will no doubt have reservations, and strong ones, about the way the movie cuts the original from three hours to slightly less than two. But Sondheim himself is on record giving the movie his blessing, knowing that as a movie buff himself, cuts were necessary for the sake of the story and the medium of film. Fortunately, Sondheim, at 77, is still with us to make the cuts to the score himself. (Over the years, this is something he has been willing to do to stage productions of his greatest works: eg. \\"Follies\\", \\"Company\\".)<br /><br />Although a Christmas release, beware: SWEENEY is not OLIVER! with street throngs bursting into big production song and dance. This, after all, is a tale of the basest of human behaviors, where a \\"pious vulture of the law\\"--Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman)--lusts after Sweeney's daughter Johanna through a peephole in the wall; where human bodies, like so much hamburger meat, are ground into \\"fresh supplies\\" for Nellie Lovett's meat pies. When all hope is abandoned, joyous, wide-angle high-kicking by the masses simply wouldn't wash.<br /><br />What does wash is an ocean of blood--its red the brightest color in a washed-out palette of sepia and ghostly white.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is the fascinating focus of the entire enterprise. His face drained of all blood with black smudges beneath his eyes, Depp is an icon of what injustice can wreak on the human spirit. When he returns from 15 years in prison on a false charge, trumped up by Judge Turpin, he is an avenging angel, so obsessed with revenge that in his rage, mankind itself is dispensable. (\\"They all deserve to die,\\" as Sondheim's lyric puts it.)<br /><br />As meat pie-maker Nellie Lovett and Sweeney's amorous accomplice in crime, Helena Bonham Carter brings a more toned-down interpretation of the role. Sondheim wrote the stage role for Angela Lansbury in whose hands Nellie Lovett was more of a star turn, a much \\"showier\\" role--hornier--that threatened to upstage the characterization of Sweeney himself. Here, Carter's humor is more subtle. As great as Lansbury's Tony Award-winning performance was, her music-hall interpretation would have thrown the movie's tone and balance out of whack. (Lansbury's turn as Mrs. Lovett is available on DVD with George Hearn as Sweeney. Tosee the original show and to hear the complete Broadway score, I urge you to see it.)<br /><br />Ghostly white make-up cannot diminish the movie star faces of Depp and Carter. Their acting chops are so right for the these roles that one overlooks their lack of vocal power as singers. Depp, whose singing voice here is a rock, Bowie-esque take, does better with Sondheim's lyrics than Carter whose somewhat lazy articulation loses what can be brilliantly breathtaking to the ear when sung with clarity.<br /><br />Finally, who but Sondheim could have juxtaposed some of the most beautiful and soaring music ever written with deeds most bloody and foul? As Sweeney does his customers', Tim Burton's film takes you by the throat--and stomach--and, for almost two hours, shows you what the wages of revenge--and madness--can be.<br /><br />With the exception of the filmed version of his \\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\\" and \\"A Little Night Music\\", Hollywood has ignored the works of Sondheim. With SWEENEY TODD's success and with Aaron Sorkin (TV's \\"The West Wing\\") currently adapting \\"Follies\\" for the screen, moviegoers could be on the brink of a geyser of Sondheim, albeit not bloody like this one.tly white make-up cannot diminish the movie star faces of Depp and Carter.

B00005JKN9|3.0|Martin Scorsese's THE GANGS OF NEW YORK was my personally most disliked film of 2002.I found it to be exceedingly long,endlessly bloody and with a script that covered way too much ground with too many subplots and characters,and an ending that was rushed compared to the first two hours of this 167 minute EPIC!  Well, given time and also a viewing of Ric Burns' 10 hour PBS documentary entitled NEW YORK, I revisited GANGS and appreciated this film so much more.I still see it as very flawed for all of the above reasons, but with the history and in depth background thoroughly in place (especially from PARTS ONE and TWO from the Ric Burns series!)I was able to better fill in all of the necessary information that Scorsese et al simply could not cram in.I could now appreciate what Scorsese was attempting to communicate about his beloved New York City in the years of immigration,political corruption and rebellion that erupted during the Civil War Years.This film can only hint at what actually happened in that time and ALL of the players and affected groups.  I continue to use the word \\"Appreciate\\" because I have such enormous respect for Scorsese and his team that has worked on so many films together.There is so much,technically, to marvel at in GANGS, but the screenplay is still the biggest problem that I have with this film.Thanks to Ric Burns who has made me respect this film more over the last five years!  An excellent follow up film to GANGS would be Scorsese's THE AGE OF INNOCENCE which chronicles the next chapter in New York history after the Civil War.I also HIGHLY recommend the 10-hour Version of the PBS Ric Burns NEW YORK.There are additional versions, but the 10 hour will suffice.It is divided into five 2-hour segments,with the first two parts establishing firm foundation for then viewing THE GANGS OF NEW YORK.

It is one of those regrets you keep with you on your short list of nagging regrets that would have made your life a bit richer. It caught me off guard the power her voice and presentation has touched this mans heart but you don't have any control of such things.<br />  I ordered the two disk set and waited for my \\"Christmas Gift\\" to me to arrive and boy it blew me away.  I would go into the way the DVD is shot and the way the Director framed his shots but it isn't about that is is about the way Celine's power as a performer jumps off the screen and goes like a laser to your heart.<br />  The song selection is fantasic and even the more abreviated past hits get a fuller treatment then other concert performers allow for those songs that we all grow to love.  I was impressed most of all with the  both the vocals and stage performace of the dancers for \\"I Surrender\\". and to a lesser extent to the fun loving pace of \\"I Drove All Night\\". They would serve well as stand alone Videos.  And what can I say about \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" that hasn't been said by other reviewers.<br />  The extras are very welcome and add a warm side dish to the feast that this set is to the true Celine fan.  I especialy enjoyed the behind the scene features on the second disk.  I can tell you even if your not a rabid fan this would be a great addition to your concert DVD collection. and the price is very affordable for all you get.
B00018TI5E|5.0|In 2004 John released `Shadows collide with people' on Warner Bros Records.  This album, in my opinion, is Frusciante's most accessible album overall, as the majority of the record has got all the ingredients for a classic Indie/pop record, (I.E - upbeat, chirpy feel good songs mixed with slow `depressing'/reflective songs).  I put the word depressing in inverted commas as these songs don't make me depressed, in fact quite the opposite because they are so well done it makes you feel good because they are enjoyable songs to listen to. But of course the lyrics and feel of the songs have a sad tone.      The difference between this album and your average indie/pop record is that it has 18 tracks on it compared to the usual 10-12 tracks.  In addition to this it has 3 instrumental tracks; `-00Ghost27', `Failure33 Object' and my personal favourite '23 Go to the End' where John uses a Doepfer A100 which is an analog modular synthesizer.  This makes the tracks stand out and creates some interesting and unconventional sounds.  I have to admit it is only until recently where I have really begun to fully appreciate these tracks.  The reason I took so long to get them was because I found them uncomfortable and difficult to listen to, compared to the rest of the album which is relatively easy listening.  However I now realise these tracks add this ghostly kind of atmosphere.  Listening to these tracks, I can picture Frusciante reflecting on his drug era where his demons use to hover about him and he was desperately trying to fight them. Such is strength and power of the sound created in these tracks; they act like a soundtrack to his battle.    If the tracks such as `Omission', ` Second Walk ` and `This Cold' are anything to go by.  It shows a man who has definitely won the battle.  Not only that but it feels like he is on top of the world, pouring his heart, soul, blood, sweat and tears into these songs.  As you may have guessed, these are the feel good, upbeat songs on the album which could brighten up anybody's day on even the coldest of winter mornings.  `Omission' sees Josh Klinghoffer sharing vocal duties with John Frusciante for the only time on the album. Josh's singing adds such warmth, honesty and delicacy to the song.   `This cold' I think sums up John's fresh attitude towards life the best.  While many would be outside in the cold, moaning and whinging, `I want the sun', `It's too cold', etc.  John very much like myself just carries on life regardless and doesn't let things like the weather stopping him do what he wants to do.  He captures it so well in this song singing `I feel this cold, I never stay, I never grow old', full of passion and enthusiasm along with a backdrop of rampant acoustic guitar playing.      Although the songs mentioned in the previous paragraph clearly show a man on the up. John is not afraid to look back on his past and reflect on what were undoubtedly the toughest years of his life.  These are done through the more `depressing' songs on the album, the best of which are `Ricky', `Regret' and `Song to Sing when I'm lonely'. These are slow songs which are designed to `move' the listener.  `Regret' has the most minimalistic lyrics on the album with only `I regret my past' and `Stay alone', are repeated regularly throughout the song to echo his sentiments and make sure they are drilled into the listener.  I think the most powerful lyrics though, comes in the opening line to `Ricky' with `I was afraid to be me'. I think this lyric sums up best what the problem was and is delivered exquisitely.    The best song on the album for me, which is also in my top ten favourite songs of all time is `Time goes back.  The reason for this is it has an epic feel about it because in my opinion it creates a massive impact on the listener.  When listening to it, I stop whatever I'm doing because it's the only way I can fully appreciate it and take it all in.  It's like a breath of fresh air, which unless you're out in the countryside is hard to come by these days. It is just such a joyful song which sends shivers down my spine with every listen especially the vocal harmony in between the first two versus followed by John singing `Jumping in the mind of a passer by' and `We live as one, two ways at once'.  The lyrics to this song are genius.     Overall a great album and out of all his albums it is my favourite.  Along with great songs the album has a certain degree of rawness about the production which adds this intimacy and honesty which enhance the songs further. I would definitely recommend this as the first port of call for anyone wishing to investigate John's solo stuff.  It was the first John album I bought and I've never looked back....
B0009P42S2|3.0|Steam-punk is sort of the retro version of cyberpunk -- 19th century gears and punch cards instead of electronics and computers. It's 1866 and the Drs. Lloyd and Edward Steam, father and son, have invented the \\"steam ball,\\" a soccer-ball-sized contraption that will contain and control steam pressure far greater than any boiler. (How it works and how you get the steam in there is brushed aside -- fortunately.) They use this fantastic new energy source, financed by the mysterious O'Hara Foundation, to construct and power the Steam Tower, now on display near the Crystal Palace at London's Great Exhibition. But the Foundation is really in the international arms business and the Steam Tower is their greatest weapon yet, including steam-powered-augmented armored solders (\\"steam troopers\\"), flying machines, submarines, and the Tower itself, which stomps around London like a gigantic metal godzilla. And who's to bring an end to this carnage? Why, Ray Steam, the adolescent scion of the Steam family and a genius inventor himself. It takes awhile before you figure out who are the Good Guys and who are the Baddies, and even then you're never quite sure. In fact, the moral of the whole story appears to be: Never trust anyone when it comes to corporate greed and weapons profits. There's lots of neat stuff here, including Ray's steam-powered omnicycle, and the enemy's huge iron waldoes, and especially Ray's makeshift quasi-rocket platform. My favorite character, though, is the arrogant, spoiled, egotistical, and completely self-involved Miss Scarlett (\\"Scarlett O'Hara\\" -- right) who wanders in and out of danger in pursuit of her own wishes. This film was directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, creator of AKIRA, and the pace and dialogue is spot-on, as is the quality of the artwork. The plot is a bit weak in places -- this is far from Otomo's best work -- but it's not bad. I'm told the English voiceover version featured Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin, and other big Hollywood names, but I preferred to watch the Japanese version with subtitles.red to watch the Japanese version with subtitles.

0143038419|5.0|One of the best books in a long while.  Anyone in their 30's and up will be sure to enjoy this book.  Especially for anyone who is going through hard times, divorce, searching within themselves, lost, or just needing a good book!  Highly recommend!!
1591396190|5.0|Today, competition between companies is rampant and bloody, especially with the new emerging economies such as China and India. According to the authors, our industries have become overcrowded, creating a \\"red ocean\\" of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. The authors argue that while most companies compete within such red oceans, this strategy is increasingly unlikely to create profitable growth in the future. The authors argue that tomorrow's leading companies will succeed not by battling competitors, but by creating \\"blue oceans\\" of uncontested market space ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, according to the authors, render rivals obsolete and unleash new demand. The authors say, \\"These ideas are not for those whose ambition in life is to get by or merely to survive.\\" (ix). The ideas in this book are meant to make a difference, and to create a company that builds a future where customers, employees, shareholders, and society win. As a side note, more than one million copies of this book were sold in the first year!    The metaphor of red and blue oceans is used to describe the market universe. Red oceans are all the industries in existence today--the known market space. In the red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and accepted, and the competitive rules of the game are known. Here companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of existing demand. As the market space gets crowded, prospects for profits and growth are reduced. Products become commodities, and cutthroat competition turns the red ocean bloody. Hence the term `red oceans'.     Blue oceans, in contrast, denote all the industries not in existence today--the unknown market space, untainted by competition. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid. In blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be set. Blue ocean is an analogy to describe thewider, deeper potential of market space that is not yet explored.    This book challenges companies to break out of the red ocean of bloody competition by creating uncontested market space that makes the competition irrelevant. Instead of dividing up existing--and often shrinking--demand and benchmarking competitors, blue ocean strategy is about growing demand and breaking away from the competition. The authors say, \\"No company--large or small, incumbent or new entrant--can afford to be a riverboat gambler. And no company should.\\" (x).    One such company that broke away from the competition is `Cirque du Soleil' (French for `Circus of the Sun). This Canadian company, founded in 1984 by Guy Laliberté, has forever changed the world of Circus entertainment. Instead of competing in a declining industry, with Circus profits at an all time low due to a decline in attendance and increase in overheads, Laliberté created a whole new industry in circus entertainment. The focus was no longer on animal shows, which were expensive to perform and were opposed by Animal Rights movements, but on spectacular audiovisual performances from artists from around the world. You'll have to attend a show to real know what `Cirque du Soleil' is all about. Each show is a synthesis of circus styles from around the world and has its own central theme and storyline which brings the audience into the performance by having no curtains and continuous live music.     Throughout the 1990s and 2000s Cirque expanded rapidly and went from one show with 73 employees in 1984 to currently 3,500 employees from over 40 countries. `Cirque du Soleil' tours every continent and has an estimated annual revenue exceeding US$600 million. The multiple permanent Las Vegas shows alone play to more than 9,000 people a night--5% of the city's visitors--adding to the 70+ million people who have experienced `Cirque du Soleil.'    Laliberté succeeded in breaking away from the competition and creating a new demand: stunning and magical performances with a storyline from cultures spanning the globe! A visit to 'Cirque' is a journey through time and space.     `Cirque du Soleil' is just one example (and the first) the authors cite. Their research is based on more than fifteen years of research on 150 strategic moves by companies in thirty industries and spanning more than a hundred years. The authors also published a series of `Harvard Business Review' articles. Their research led them to create strategies to making the competition irrelevant.     In this book, you will be introduced to the six principles that every company can use to successfully formulate and execute blue oceans. You will learn how to reconstruct market boundaries, focus on the big picture, reach beyond existing demand, get the strategic sequence right, overcome organizational hurdles, and build execution into strategy. Basically, these strategies will chart \\"a bold new path to winning the future.\\"     The authors say that there are no permanently excellent companies, just as there are no permanently excellent industries. A perfect example is Polaroid. A giant once; gone today. The industry itself has changed and evolved, with the advent of digital photography. The companies that created a new demand in this industry are the ones that survived.

0307387151|4.0|After reading Atonement, my first foray into an Ian McEwan world, I had one overwhelming thought, do we ever have a day where we wake up and know that we've crossed over the threshold from being a child to an adult? If the answer is yes, please share the secret for how you knew. I'm still not sure when it happened.    Starting in pre-World War II England, Atonement focuses on the world of privilege enjoyed by the upper class and the growing attempts of its servants to cross the chasm. McEwan highlights this tug-of-war with the flirtation between the daughter of the house, Cecilia, and the son of the charlady, Robbie. Hovering throughout the book, Cecilia's younger sister Briony tries to capture the world as she see it through her writing, putting people into nice compartments, complete with happy endings. At 13, Briony is straddling the roles of child and adult.     Through her single faceted view of the world she sees a series of events between her sister, Cecilia, and Robbie that appear threatening because Briony lacks the nuanced understanding of what can happen between a man and a woman. In a naive attempt to protect her sister from Robbie, Briony falsely accuses him of attacking a visiting cousin, creating a chain of events that stretches over 60+ years.    Some have complained that this story ends in an unsatisfying way. However, McEwan within the last few pages explains more accurately, for me, what drives a writer, and thus, the reason for this particular ending. To often, we seem to expect a neat and tidy conclusion to our stories. Perhaps we're looking to escape from the chaos and uncertainty of everyday life. Perhaps that is why Atonement resonated with me: it's real life captured on a page to be read again and again in all of life's messy glory.

B000UJ48SQ|5.0|If a movie can be said to have texture this is it. This is, by far, Stanley Kubrick's best movie. Coincidentally, this is Ryan O'Neal's best movie though he told an interviewer that Kubrick drove him crazy during the production. Kubrick experimented with cameras to capture the quality of candle light. For the most part, he was able to avoid artificial lighting but not entirely.  Technology has its limits though. Actors were required to keep still during the scenes lit by candles; the cameras needed a narrow focus.<br /><br />Though Hollywood legend says that all the costumes were antiques, this is not true. However, given Kubrick's nature for exact detail I am sure the copies looked original in every minutia. Supposedly, Kubrick framed scenes in the movie to match paintings by a Gainsborough, who would, perhaps have been a contemporary of Barry Lyndon, had he been real. This movie won a slew of Oscars for cinematography, best music, art direction and costume.<br /><br />As all good movies, there is some basis in fact. The original story was by William Makepeace Thackeray on one of Queen Elizabeth's ancestors: Mary Eleanor Bowes, the Countess of Strathmore, called \\"the unhappy countess\\" for her love affair with an Irish rake and fortune hunter Andrew Robinson Stoney. Thackeray is the author of \\"Vanity Fair,\\" which no doubt was the reason for Kubrick's interest in the film.<br /><br />This is an excellent film for couples. There is little violence. The pace is slow but this allows the audience to absorb, full measure, the atmosphere this movie attempts to create. Kubrick was successful, I believe.<br /><br />If this was helpful, please add your vote.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|The 4-Disc DVD set is remarkable.  I've been glued to my TV set watching it  all.  The thoroughness of the set rivals the LORD OF THE RINGS sets.      Only one major complaint:  The outside of the box says that, on Disc 4, there is a \\"DVD Restoration\\" featurette.  I was really hoping to see a documentary on all the changes that have been made, including re-shooting Joanna Cassidy's scenes.    It's not on the 4-Disc set.  According to Digital Bits, the 30-minute featurette is on the 5-Disc set, on the 5th disc (the work print).    So ... The box for the 4-Disc set isn't entirely correct, which is a bummer.    Perhaps I should have binged and gotten the 5-Disc set.

B000ZOW96Y|2.0|I'm pleased to say that Unbox worked perfectly fine for me. With Comcast High Speed Cable, I was able to download the movie in under 30 minutes. Not bad.    The movie itself, however, was only so-so. Definitely the worst out of the three Ocean movies. Why? This one had the least amount of conflict. They were able to pull off the job too easily. No real surprises here. The plot was rushed and no different than the previous two Ocean movies. It was almost like watching a rerun. Wouldn't recommend it, even at $1.99 for a rental.

B00005JPTI|3.0|Director Francis Lawrence is the third to adapt Richard Matheson's classic novel [[ASIN:0765357151 I Am Legend]] to the big screen.  The story takes place three years after a cure for cancer mutated into a virus that transformed humanity into cannibalistic ghouls who can't bear sunlight.  In the midst of this is Robert Neville (Will Smith) who appears to be the last surviving human.  Neville was an army scientist, and has been searching for a cure ever since the outbreak began.  He has turned his home into a fortress to keep him safe at night and spends his days foraging for food and other essentials in addition to conducting research.  Neville is fighting the good fight, but with only his loyal German shepherd to keep him company, he's struggling to maintain his sanity.     For those who have read the book, there are numerous changes in the story.  These changes are significant enough that one is better served simply watching the movie for its own sake and setting aside the book completely.  Think of it as \\"inspired by\\" rather than \\"based on\\" the novel.  While there is some humor, the overall tone of the movie is pretty bleak.  Neville lives under the constant threat of sudden death if he wanders into the wrong place or allows the creatures to find his home.  The infected are ferociously aggressive, fast, agile, relentless, and cunning.      Will Smith turns in a strong performance, which will surprise no one who has seen him before.  His dog is very likeable as well, and the audience roots for him just as much as Neville (maybe more if you're an animal lover).  The pace of the movie is uneven and it sags a bit in the middle.  The action scenes are all quite scary, though, as the infected are so hyperactively vicious in the way they attack.  The ending doesn't quite fit the rest of the movie, but it should satisfy those who want to see something hopeful come out of all the tragedy that has taken place.     I did have some problems with certain aspects of the movie.At one point, the infected apparently set a trap for Neville that is simple in some ways, but very complex in others.  I'm not at all certain that I could rig the same trap, and these creatures are portrayed as being so primitive and rabid that it's hard to picture them hatching such a plan.  I had other issues with the plot, but since they occur in the second half, I will not specify them to avoid spoilers.    I Am Legend is a decent movie and the legion of Will Smith fans will almost certainly want to give it a try.  It's far from perfect, but it has scary action scenes, pathos, and even a little humor.  As mentioned earlier, fans of the book will need to set aside their expectations and go along for the ride or avoid this movie like the plague.  You will not find anything remotely resembling a faithful re-creation here.

B000GW8RX4|5.0|Great DVD.  Dio, Cozy etc, what more could you ask.  This also appears to be the last tour the mega large Rainbow light show was used.  I was awe struck with how many different displays could be achieved with 1970's era technnology.  Listen to the audio commentary area.  It explains that Blackmore talked of throwing the lights overboard while on a Japan tour and that was the end of it.  Quite a shame.<br /><br />On to the DVD.  This show is bittersweet.  This is perhaps the best lineup of the band and thank God there is a record of it.  Because of Blackmore's dictorial way of doing things, he kept dismissing band members.  When Dio left, I think it was done at that point.  What Rainbow released in the 80's was more pop.  The medieval / english themes in the early records were distinct.<br /><br />The disturbing area of the DVD comes at the end when Blackmore destroys a black Stratocaster.  He comes awefully close to hitting the audience as he swings the guitar by the strings still attached.  I thought that was careless of him, but it was interesting to watch.  There appears to be too much focal point on Blackmore.  In my opinion, he was ok, not a great guitarist.  Also, he had literally no eye contact with the audience.  One could see the control he had over the band while they waited for his endless guitar interludes to end.  He used hand signals to keep the band in check.<br /><br />Overall a good DVD.  The audio commentary is excellent, and the two interviews were good as well.  The only drawback is the lack of interview material from Blackmore.  Strange.  One can only wonder why he did not participate, of why the production staff failed to contact him?

B000OQF6N6|1.0|This is a really weak album and I am sad that I have to say that. I really loved the Pumpkins. For me their creativity peaked with Mellon Collie & Adore. Mellon Collie is probably their best, an outstanding album in its own means.  I really loved Adore as well, though they changed their style. It was completely different then their other records but the songs were very strong. Even the B-sides of the Ava Adore single (Czarina and Once In a While were beautiful songs).    For me Billy Corgan was not only a truly gifted guitarist but also an outstanding songwriter.    Then with Machine the decline had begun. There were some decent songs but the whole sound of the album I didn't really like. Zwan was OK but nothing special. The solo-thing wasn't good either and now this?    Billy Corgan said during the Adore area that they needed to do a change because in terms of their previous style they have achieved anything there is and it couldn't really get any better. And yes, Adore was a strong album, thought different.    But this new album is so weak. It's really hard to believe that after 8 long years this is the best Billy Corgan was capable of. It seems that he's really lost his edge. And that's sad.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|No hay mucho que agregar sobre \\"The Joshua Tree\\" que es uno de los productos que integran &eacute;ste pack. El disco es simplemente una obra maestra de la m&uacute;sica popular del siglo xx y &eacute;sta edici&oacute;n es la misma que la original de 1987 (que est&eacute; superrecontraremasterizado es algo que al o&iacute;do com&uacute;n no le importa mucho). Aparte del disco original trae otro con las caras B de los singles que incluye temas que ya hab&iacute;an sido publicados en \\"The Best Of 1980-1990\\" (joyas como \\"Luminous Times\\", \\"Walk To The Water\\", \\"Spanish Eyes\\" y \\"Sweetest Thing\\", temas tan brillantes como los que entraron en \\"Joshua\\") y agrega otros que  se nota porque nunca hab&iacute;an sido lanzados antes ya que no llegan al nivel del resto de la obra musical de los irlandeses, pero para los fans siempre son bienvenidos.<br />Tambi&eacute;n viene con unas fotos que, de nuevo, para fans puede estar bien, aunque a mi que me considero uno de ellos no me aportan nada m&aacute;s que una especie de nostalgia innecesaria.<br /><br />Las joyas son el libro y el DVD. El primero puede pensarse exclusivo para fans, pero en realidad algunas opiniones vertidas en &eacute;l son un retrato perfecto de uno de los dos mejores momentos de una gran banda, y adem&aacute;s de una de las &eacute;pocas del siglo m&aacute;s controversiales. Y por supuesto de la \\"Gran Am&eacute;rica\\", &eacute;sa que se ama y se odia pero que no se puede obviar, y cuando un artista se ve inmerso en &eacute;sa idea, el resultante es, como lo dec&iacute;a antes, una obra maestra. Todo tiene sentido, todo encaja a la perfecci&oacute;n, y si quedaba alguna duda, el libro la despeja sin recurrir a comentarios obvios o que s&oacute;lo puedan entender los fans de la banda. No quedan dudas de que te puede gustar o no Bono, pero es el artista popular m&aacute;s sagaz de nuestros tiempos, y &eacute;sos fueron sus primeros pasos hacia su particular madurez m&uacute;sical y filos&oacute;fica.<br /><br />El dvd nos muestra un documental divertido por momentos, con los integrantes de la banda en la diaria, zapando, tomando (mucho), viajando por USA (mucho), trayendo algunos video clips poco vistos (\\"Spanish Eyes\\", \\"In God's Country\\") y mostrandolos como si a&uacute;n no entendieran muy bien de que se iba a tratar todo a partir de &eacute;ste disco para U2. A&uacute;n hoy hay veces que parece que no lo entienden, aunque lo saben.

0563486430|1.0|I really wasn't expecting much in terms of quality when I bought this book; fan fictions can often be quite painful to get through in terms of plot, characterization, and style.    In many ways, I wasn't disappointed. I found that the characters were mere cardboard cut-outs of how they are portrayed in the shows, the plot was a bit see-through, and the quality of the prose was very, very bad. When I got to a description of Trajan's column, and the author used the term \\"a sort of temple thing at the bottom,\\" I really wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry.    Unless you've a spare hour or two to waste on mindless... very mindless... \\"entertainment\\", I'd not recommend this one at all.

B000002UDD|5.0|This cd displays the awesome ability of Megadeth, Jeff Young does an awesome job of filling in for Chris Poland I really believe Young Was better than Poland and very well may be better than Marty Friedman just amazing dual shred solos from Dave and Jeff all around includes Ellefson's great thundering bass lines with very memorable drumming from Chuck Behler the most underrated Megadeth cd EVER, listening to this cd makes me feel that its an atrocity that this lineup didn't create anymore studio albums.
0316067598|4.0|Overall this was a pretty decent read. Marcus gives a detailed account of what it is like being a Navy SEAL in Afghanistan. This book is recommended for anyone with an interest in the Navy SEALS--specifically what it's like to become one and what it is like to serve as one.  The dedication and will power that Marcus displays--to his fellow SEALS and to this country--is second to none, and we should all be grateful for his service to our country.

B00005JPTI|1.0|I was hopeful when I went to see \\"I am Legend.\\"  I liked the Charleton Heston version.  And to be fair, there was some good stuff in this movie -- here and there: the numerous shots of NYC devoid of people are impressive and while one soon feels the profusion of such shots is unnecessary (only the dimmest would have failed to have gotten the point very early), it was understandable that the producers were eager to share their accomplishment.   The movie must have cost a bundle.  Better use it all.    Moreover, Will Smith has a few effective scenes, and it was not his fault that he was upstaged by his canine co-star, who deserves some kind of animal Oscar (there actually is such a thing, but I forget its name).  Finally, the myth of \\"I Am Legend\\" is a powerful one.  It's a strong story, the kind of story it would take considerable effort to mess up. Who has not felt at times that he is among the last of humanity, struggling to survive while surrounded by vampires (figuratively speaking) -- perhaps at a family gathering or company picnic?     Yet the movie can be barely said to work.  It is one of those films in which any given scene is either good, but we've seen it before, many times before, or bad, and we really don't want to see it now at all.  A film in which drama is repeatedly sacrificed to special effects and big scenes.  One leaves the film not so much hating it, but wondering what was the point?      To the screen writers of this travesty here is a clue: without drama, there can be no point.  This is terribly lazy screen writing.  For example, the credits reference the work of both prior screenplays.  Did the currently screen writers somehow find the original source material weak and insufficient?  If so, why even make the movie?  This is what we call a bad sign.     Here is an example of how bad it is, one of many.  Since nothing substantive follows from the scene, I think I can describe it without spoiling anything.      The scene is a flashback.  It shows a huge, panicking crowd trying to escape.  People are being given eye scans to see if they have contracted the virus.  [What the virus turns the infected into will be noted shortly.]  A soldier who is doing the scanning, first gets a bad (positive) reading on the hero's wife.  Now remember, Smith's character is a medical doctor.  One of the Army's highest ranking in fact.  Here's what happens.  Smith starts yelling at the soldier, screaming out his rank and demanding the man scan his wife again.  The soldier complies (why would he be reluctant to give a second scan?).  This time the reading is negative.  End of scene.      What is wrong here?  For one thing, a real doctor would know at once that either the instrument is defective or the soldier does not know how to use it.  Since the procedure is quite simple, the latter possibility can be ignored.  There's not much time.  The first, however, cannot.  There is a grave risk that the instrument is defective.  Which means infected people have likely been allowed through.  His wife may be now become of them.  Remember, Smith is a top ranking military doctor.  He must be aware of that risk.  He must be aware of his responsibilities.  What to do?  What a real doctor would do is stop everything, use another detector, and perform the scan again.      The situation now is quite tense.  If his wife passes this scan, at least we can be confident that she is free of the disease.  But if she fails...  He tests her again.  Either way, the danger of infected people having gotten through is considerable.  The terror on Smith's face should show the decisions he has to make and at once.      This alternative scene would also, btw, tie directly with a later scene, the best in the film, so the audience would be prepared for it.     But the variant scene, the one with that thing we call drama, is not in the movie.  Instead we get explosions, helicopters spinning out of control, and a chance for Smith to bawl out a white guy for no reason whatever.  The whole screen play is like that.      It gets worse.  Smith talks along with an entire sequence in Shrek (I) to tell us how much he loves that movie?  Why?  What does this add?  He gives us a lecture on how much he likes Bob Marley's music.  I like it too, but why are these scenes here?  What is the point?  (I suspect, cynically no doubt, the company that made \\"I Am Legend\\" has financial interests in both).    There is also something vaguely racist about the whole business.  If you imagine a movie about a white doctor being besieged...   Well, this film piles it on.  New York is perhaps the most diverse city on earth.  Why, when the plague hits does it turn the victims into incredibly buff, twenty-something, white people (who would be killers on a basketball court)?   Smith really hates them.   One long action scene demonstrates the full degree of that hatred -- but they are his patients, for god's sake!  Why in that scene would he risk throwing his life away for the sheer joy of killing them?     And wouldn't you think that Smith, who is himself is immune to the plague, as a doctor would find that fact an incredibly important clue?   Nope.  He does nothing with it.      Ebert has written about the offensive stranger on the bus.  The smelly, boring, crude, and obnoxious individual, always too close for comfort and who is impossible to ignore.  Now imagine a two hour bus ride with that individual.  That is what this movie and its screen play is like.      For shame on all concerned.    Except, Sam the dog.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|The recent surge in repackaged classic albums has resulted in confusion regarding their collective merit, especially when compared to the original releases. Most repackagings offer a few extra tracks and improved audio but little more. Also, the extra tracks are usually extraneous to the original product, providing little of interest to anyone except hardcore fans. Every now and then, though, a re-released package manages to surpass the original release not because it reinvents the original album, but because it expands on that album's innate strength. The original version of \\"The Joshua Tree\\" sold over 20 million copies and won a Grammy for Album of the Year. It is arguably U2's strongest album, but there is no argument that this re-packaging expands on that album's vision in every way.<br /> The package itself is beautiful, consisting of a hardcover sleeve encasing two disks in a well-constructed box. The booklet contains excellent liner notes by critic Bill Flanagan as well as the Edge, with reproduced lyrics fleshed out by a generous collection of additional photos and artwork, including detailed listings of all related singles and their respective chart positions. Flanagan's essay describes how the band utilized the landscape of American deserts that so impressed them while touring the country as a canvas to convey their own personal visions, while The Edge provides a more practical perspective on the details involved in recording these now-classic tracks. The remastered sound adds a clarity that becomes the meticulous production of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, but the real highlight (other than the album itself) is the compilation of recordings associated with the original album.

B000YENUI6|4.0|David \\"Bloodthirsty\\" Cronenberg weaves a Russian Mafia story with slashed throats, seedy characters and an unclad Viggo Mortensen. Trying hard to mimic the sincerity and violent appeal of The Godfather, while adding occasional helpings of dramatic revenge and redemption, Eastern Promises is incredibly entertaining and sadly short-lived. So much potential lays in the crafty construction of the dashing, cool and baleful lead character, yet the film abruptly resolves with a succinct running time and too-brief satisfaction.<br /><br />Anna (Naomi Watts) discovers the diary of a young girl who dies at her hospital, leaving a newborn baby behind. In her attempts to get the mysterious Russian book translated, she comes across the deceptively calm Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who has insidious ties with the Eastern European crime syndicate Vory V Zakone, and may be involved with the pregnant girl's death. Semyon's brash son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) and his menacingly arcane chauffeur Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen) must decide with whom their allegiances lay as bodies pile up and secrets become uncovered.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen's performance is unabashedly outstanding, and tops his previous role in Cronenberg's \\"A History of Violence\\". Both characters carry sordid pasts and troubled consciences, but Eastern Promises' Nikolai exudes slickness with his snazzy black getup and unflinching, piercing gaze. He is the ultimate dark-robed gangster henchman, and grabs the viewer's attention like a knife to the eye. From the moment he is introduced, subtleties and foreshadowing elude to a deeper and more complex character than what is so suavely displayed on the calmly cold exterior.<br /><br />If violence begets realism then Eastern Promises is as real as it gets. Cronenberg's penchant for delivering imagery unlike any seen before is certainly evident here, this time in the form of a bathhouse fight sequence that transcends violence as we know it. A gritty air of believability draws us into the seedy underworld of the Russian Mafia that Cronenberg has created and scathingly dark images keep reality cemented wherever the masterful director chooses. It's not quite violence for violence's sake, (though it comes ever so close) and this history of violence demands our attention - and gets it. A powerful tool for commanding seriousness, such brazen displays of carnage from an unflinching camera seem destined for cathartic release, though when none is truly offered, audiences may have to create their own at the highest point of the excessive brutality. Other than the aforementioned scene of agonizingly vicious bloodshed, Eastern Promises actually feels lacking in an overall body count, as one would hope to follow Nikolai in a journey of vengeance and usurpation, but the real rampage against villainy likely lies just beyond the end credits.<br /><br />The dark and brooding world of the Russian Mafia is not one we're used to seeing, and such a fascinating existence requires an epic story. At a running time shy of two hours however, Cronenberg's foray into this seedy underworld feels sadly cut short and truncated at its climax. Before the brutal power struggle can come full circle, the film is over and we're left briefly satisfied while quickly realizing we want more. Eastern Promises is a fitting title as it does just that - it promises an epic story of mystery, deception, and revenge, but doesn't quite deliver as much as it should. Regardless, fans of the genre and Cronenberg's style will be delighted to see just how far the director pushes the boundaries of violence to tell an intriguingly morbid tale of survival.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsnderworld of the Russian Mafia that Cronenberg has created and scathingly dark images keep reality cemented wherever the masterful director chooses.

0142000655|2.0|After several distractions, and more than two months, I finally reached the end of Steinbeck's so-called 'epic'. Apparently, I should have watched the movie instead.  There's not a lot to add to previous reviews. The story is long, unfocused, long, rambling, long, cliched, long, tiresome, long, repetitious, and not short.  The scope of the story is simply too large, and there are too many characters who ultimately add nothing to the drama. The 'modern day Cain and Abel' angle is worn into the ground long before the story even turns its attention to Cal and Aron. The previous generation(Charles and Adam) make perhaps the dullest pair of charcters ever put together in any work of fiction, and the long, incresingly frequent digressions to catch up on the Hamiltons, the progress of American history and its impact on Salinas, and the state of the prostitution industry, serve to slow this book to a glacial pace.  The Chinese housekeeper, Lee, is perhaps the only saving grace in the second half of the book, although the final scene involving he, Cal, and Adam redeems some, if not all of the novel's shortcomings.  Generally, 'East of Eden' disappoints, because it asks readers to make a long-term emotional investment in a largely lifeless and dull saga, populated (with only a few exceptions) by cardboard characters.  In my view, Steinbeck was at his best with more compact novels or short stories. 'Eden' might have worked better if Steinbeck had followed the more loosely-formatted framework of 'Cannery Row', rather than weighing down this story with so much verbiage.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|This is a superb horror film. Spawning multiple sequels, the original is still the best. Horror films are often over looked by award givers in part to the genre in general- most \\"award\\" films are more drama films.<br />This isn't some European horror trip leaving you confused, and searching for the meaning to the film. And it isn't the squirting blood fest that many \\"horror\\" films are. This is a well thought out film- relying on plot and acting, rather than CGI or over the top gore.<br />Excellent film- rent it first if you like, but buy it too. Five stars all the way. -If you like Se7en, Hostel, Jaws, or Zodiac, check this film out.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I heard a lot of good reviews about this movie but it exceeded my expectation. It not only tells the story of the time in history when there was \\"East\\" Germany, but also it's a love story, and a human psychology drama. All of that is so seamlessly intertwined in the story under the dark screen. It was stasi then, who knows what it is now that keeps a watch on today for more people than just a few.    Overall, it's a very well-made movie, will be definitely worth the time!

B0002KPIQY|2.0|This film draws on an extreme true-life story that seems sure to make a person feel and think.  In 1979, a rough, wild, pretty 19-year-old from a broken home leaves Philadelphia, where she works behind the counter at her father's Italian diner and hangs out in seedy nightclubs, for New York City.  She becomes a phenomenal success almost overnight as an elite, new-wave, jet-set fashion model with \\"attitude.\\"  She parties on the wild side, has a close, on-and-off lesbian relationship with a makeup artist, suddenly loses her agent/mentor to cancer, and heavily abuses harder and harder drugs, frequenting \\"needle parks.\\"  Quickly, she burns out her body, relationships, and career.  Reduced to trading sex for money, she is beaten up and raped.  She is arrested for reckless driving and resisting arrest.  She tries to make a career come-back and to go home.  She sells jeans in a local shop.  After repeated tries at rehabilitation, she either relapses or attempts a massive overdose.  In seclusion in a hospital indigent ward, she dies in 1986 at 26 of the newly discovered AIDS.    Angelina Jolie gives a raw, emotional performance, combining child-like and hard qualities. The generally well-acted main supporting characters are thin (especially the idealized, \\"sweetness and light\\" Elizabeth Mitchell character), at times hammy (Mercedes Ruehl), but have some basic believability and traits that play into the drama (Faye Dunaway, Ruehl coddling and pushing; Ruehl and Mitchell withdrawing for various reasons; Eric Cole as a decent but dim hometown pal). There are glimmers of poignancy in some interactions and details of the experiences. Probably the film's most effective moments are the model's relationship with the makeup artist and destructive drug use (dominating the last half). The movie conveys (partly by fictionalizing and tightly limiting its snapshots of her life) a sense of frenzy, loneliness, and emptiness -- life in a dead zone.    Yet, the movie is startlingly unsatisfying on any but the most basic emotional level of watching the vivid, photogenic Jolie act out the fateful events, with flashes of striking visuals in recreated settings and with perhaps the invitation to viewers to project onto the screen whatever trite, preconceived notions they might want to see about emotional problems, exploitation, or addiction. The film seems to lack any point of view.  It narrates through sketchy, spotty vignettes rather than thoughtfully examines.  The movie lacks detail, context, depth, substance, and insight, the characters and events little more than a blur. It barely scratches the surface, if that, of what were her \\"demons,\\" how and why they came about, what was special about them, why they hit her so hard, and why drug abuse was her answer.  (Regarding technique, scenes shift arbitrarily from color to black-and-white and back again, sometimes accented by heavy-handed music; they alternate with awkward, glib documentary-style \\"interviews\\"; and the long, distinctive chain-link-fence photo shoot and shower scenes, intended to be candid and uninhibited, are hampered by the staginess of the apparent effort to avoid full frontal nudity, even in the extended, uncut version.)    Consistent with statements in the film that \\"No one knew Gia\\" (including her), its treatment of her background, emotional problems, promiscuity (among a flurry of quick, slick throwaway lines at the start we are told, but never shown, that she \\"slept around\\" but sex \\"was not the goal,\\" \\"was not an issue\\"), overall relationships, lesbianism, drug addiction, and (strangely and especially) her modeling talent, career, and world (\\"America's first supermodel\\") is vague, minimalist, and simplistic. Particularly weak or artificial are the statements mouthed by actors playing her contemporaries in the retrospectives; by the Italian photographer who spouts drivel as pious philosophy (\\"This is life....\\"); by the scornful, speechifying woman in the stilted, scripted rehab scene; and most disappointingly by the model herself and her \\"journal\\" (presented as poetic gems of meaning but falling far short of any such thing, even the message she wanted to send from her deathbed oddly off and easy, given her experiences: \\"she wanted to tell kids, you can handle it, you can handle anything that comes your way\\"). The movie does painfully little to delve beneath surface notions and manifestations and to illuminate any real understanding of this woman's situation, even less why she was a human being worthy of all of this special attention.    As a result, those reviews that claim to find profound meaning in this film are left to string together fuzzy, lofty-sounding cliches and platitudes (\\"tragic\\" \\"lost soul\\" or \\"free spirit\\" who \\"lived in the moment\\" and \\"followed her instincts,\\" \\"did not allow herself to be loved,\\" \\"did not know what 'true love' was,\\" with \\"so much 'artificial love' surrounding her\\"; \\"too beautiful to die, too wild to live\\"; \\"take nothing for granted,\\" \\"strive for your dreams and follow your heart,\\" \\"you can never love or forgive your children enough,\\" \\"money does not make a person happy,\\" \\"we all want mainly to be loved and accepted\\") and to coast on the extreme, sensationalistic events of the model's life.  Some make vast pretensions for the movie (that it itself does not make, much less deliver on), building up a heroine or martyr and sketching a morality play that blames everyone and everything else for what happened to her, while asking no hard questions about her own willful qualities and responsibility for her own behavior.  The claims of deep meaning come across as shallow glorification of physical beauty, of tempestuousness, or of a glamorous, sensuous image for their own sake or as sheer sentimentality for a supposedly pathetic, helpless victim.    Ironically, all of the mindless emoting, adulation, even idolatry by those claiming to know, admire, or adore this woman through this essentially superficial movie -- just as surely as her supposed exploitation in her chosen career -- risks again reducing her, now in death, to a flat, one-dimensional, token figure being grabbed at by the masses (as fallen physical beauty, force of nature, glossy image, or victim).  And if that does not diminish her as a whole human being, it may merely lavish undeserved attention and acclaim on a person of little or no substance (mired in what is presented as near-total confusion about who she was, what she wanted, and what she cared about, combined with non-stop destructive, thrill-seeking, instant-gratification behavior).  The hollowness at the core of this film, of its subject, and of so much of this site's commentary about it is as troubling as the events depicted.

B000VR824S|5.0|If you like music,any style, you'll enjoy \\"Crossroads\\" 2007. The level of talent and the variety of artists combine to make this a must have DVD.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I saw a few episodes on TV and then bought series 1-3 so I could see the whole thing end-to-end.  It was well worth it!  Not only is this creative science fiction with a plot that develops over the season and from season to season, but Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper really bring the characters to life.  Excellent season!  I especially enjoyed the World War II episodes.  Enjoy!!!

B000ICL3KG|2.0|I like to think I'm environmentally conscious. I recycle. I carpool. I use my bike when I can. I turn off lights in the rooms I'm not using. We've switched all of our bulbs out to fluorescents. To me, it's all part of being pro-life, only pro-life for the planet. Landfills are overflowing, and we will someday run out of coal and oil. Besides, our dependence on foreign oil leads us into quagmires like the one in Iraq. So why not focus on renewable resources and on minimizing our footprint for future generations? It's just a practical and responsible thing to do.    The thing I don't understand about the modern environmental movement is why it focuses so much on fear and doom. Politicians from both sides of the aisle seem to be using fear as their trump cards these days. On the right, it's fear of terrorism -- \\"just hand over your Constitutional liberties, and we'll protect you.\\" And on the left, it's things like the environment -- \\"the sky is falling.\\" Don't misunderstand: I'm glad that Al Gore is passionate about his cause. Maybe he can make more people think about the consequences of their daily actions. (Do you really need to drive that 10 MPG Hummer?) But his documentary doesn't focus on this aspect. Instead, it focuses on environmental catastrophe, jumps to lots of conclusions, deceptively frames several arguments, and ultimately says very little about what we can do to reverse course.     One assumes, based on Gore's political track record, that his solution would be based in more government regulations. Instead of encouraging and empowering people to make their world a better place, and trusting them to make the right choices, people like Gore seem to think that the unwashed masses can't be counted on to do things right on their own. That patronizing attitude comes through in Gore's presentation. I'm sure he means well, but you never get the sense that he thinks people are responsible or smart enough to fix this problem on their own -- if it can be fixed at all. So you're left wondering what the point of it all is, other than a chance for Gore to do some grandstanding by flying around the world -- and burning up fossil fuels all along the way -- to wag fingers at people and push for more legislation.     Are we in the midst of a man-made crisis? Gore seems certain that we are. And although I have no doubt that humans are having an impact on the environment, I also don't think current trends can be definitevely attributed to any particular cause. The environment goes through natural cycles of warming and cooling, and 1,000 years from now, scientists may look back and determine that this period was part of a natural fluctuation. Again, that's not to discount the problems we are currently seeing, and it's no cause for inaction or neglect. I simply think that Gore, like so many in the environmental movement, are too quick to place blame and too short on solutions.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|Visually, the film either met or exceeded what I expected from Tim Burton, beginning with the opening titles and the bloodwork through and across the screen, setting the tone for everything to come. I have to admit that I was wanting to like it more than I was actually was at first, and this definitely had to do with it being my favorite musical.  Though I tried to have no expectations of the performances being theatrical, it was difficult if not impossible not to compare it with the stage version.     It also took me a while to get used to the \\"low energy\\" of the performances, being so used to over-the-top theatricality in this piece. Then, somehow during the sequence between Judge Turpin and Anthony, EVERYTHING clicked and fell into place for me and I was into it as an entirely separate entity from what I know. The performances were uniformly excellent.     I had some difficulty with Helena Bonham Carters' delivery of \\"The Worst Pies in London\\" - and some dialogue more whispered than spoken, but no more quibbles than that.    As a splatter film fan, I thought Mr. Burton's artful gore was as inspired as the great Italian horror maestro, Dario Argento. The impressive arterial sprays and blood soaking everything (especially the opening and closing sequences) was, for a horror fan, great fun! In fact, the entire physical production was stunning and itself seemed to take the place of the chorus. The only choral part I ended up really missing was the \\"More Hot Pies\\" sequence, which was nonetheless impressive. Burton's blending of the comic and the horror was perfect, with the touching moments of Sondheim's score achieving an intimacy not possible on stage. The \\"By the Sea\\" sequence managed to be both touching and hilarious - and visually magnificent, a wicked splash of whimsical color amidst all the gray and gore.     I worried (unnecessarily as it turns out) about \\"Epiphany\\" and how it would work on screen and Burton's solution ended up being brilliant, probably my favorite moment of the film. Brilliant also was the \\"Johanna/City on Fire\\" sequence, the brutality, bloodiness and beauty all coalescing into pure cinema magic. Heck, I didn't even mind Alan Rickman's horrid, tuneless singing! (He was pure evil as Turpin - which helped.) The actor playing Beadle Bamford was tremendously effective . . . just pure \\"ew.\\" Sasha Baron Cohen was great creepy fun as Pirelli.     I loved the treble as Toby - worked far better than having a \\"teen\\" for this part in a film. His \\"Nothing's gonna harm you\\" got me moist around the peepers and Bonham Carter's reactions were incredible as myriad emotions all played out across her face and through her eyes knowing what had to come next - this was powerful, gut churning stuff and it just wrecked me.    Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter were both magnificent. The depth of character was remarkable, especially Depp who, playing Sweeney as one already half dead, yet infusing so much raw emotion into that corpse of a man . . . it was often heart wrenching.     While from Ms. Bonham Carter I might have wished for a little better singing she was simply tremendous as Mrs. Lovett (and looked gloriously bad yet beautiful).     This was an absolute treat - a moving, hilarious, powerful and terrifying movie I plan on enjoying again . . . and owning on DVD the minute it comes out!     Go see it!
B000UR9T8C|3.0|\\"Spider-Man 3\\" precariously balances an excess of plot elements that never come together quite cohesively but nonetheless produce a reasonably entertaining action movie. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is basking is Spiderman's glory and plans to propose marriage to Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), who continues to struggle with her stage career. Flint Marco (Thomas Hayden Church), a small-time crook believed to have murdered Parker's dear Uncle Ben, has been transformed into the Sandman by an opportune accident with a particle accelerator. Harry Osborn (James Franco) has decided to avenge his father by becoming the Green Goblin reincarnate. A self-absorbed upstart named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is after Parker's job at the Daily Bugle. If that weren't enough trouble, an insidious symbiotic organism is bringing out the worst in Spider-Man.<br /><br />That's only half of it. This plot is crowded. Ultimately, \\"Spider-Man 3\\" continues to explore Peter Parker's struggle with his own psyche in the form of conflicting emotions and desires. But this isn't as effective as the previous two films. The overloaded narrative seems scattershot. I don't think Tobey Maguire's performance is as strong as it has been in the past, but Topher Grace contributes a nice edge as the amoral narcissist Brock, who later becomes Venom, a villain who shares many powers with Spider-Man. My reaction to Sandman is lukewarm, but I love what they did with Venom. It's disappointing that this third installment isn't as visually smart as its predecessors. Dramatic, thoughtful composition is what placed the Spider-Man films a cut above most superhero movies. Still entertaining, but most of \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is nothing special.<br /><br />The DVD (Columbia 2007 single disc): Bonus features include Bloopers (6 min), a music video for \\"Signal Fire\\" (4 min), Galleries of Sketches, Paintings, Special Effects, Director & Cast, video game and toy previews (2 min), and 2 audio commentaries. The 1st commentary is with director Sam Raimi and actors Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Thomas Hayden Church, James Franco, Topher Grace, and Bryce Dallas Howard. This is conversational but informative, a mix of the actor's experiences and observations with discussion of the collaborative aspect of the film, characters, visual effects, and more. The 2nd audio commentary is with producers Laura Ziskin, Avi Arad, Grant Curtis, visual effects supervisor Scott Stokdyk, and editor Bob Murawski. They talk about shooting the effects sequences, scenes from concept to realization, casting, evolution of the story, and technical stuff.and actors Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Thomas Hayden Church, James Franco, Topher Grace, and Bryce Dallas Howard.

B000W4HJ44|5.0|This musical remake of John Waters's Hairspray was a lot more fun to watch than I thought I would be. I love the John Waters version and I dreaded watching something that just might not be as strong and well done as that movie was.<br /><br />I was wrong. This musical rocks!<br /><br />Hairspray takes the plot of the John Waters movie and turns it into a musical with heart and soul. You feel compassion for Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) who plays the \\"fat girl\\" who gets her guy Link Larkin (Zac Efron) after all. We follow Tracy and her friend Penny as they are growing up in Baltimore in early 1962. Tracy wants nothing more than to dance on a local TV record hop show called The Corny Collins Show. Of course, Tracy gets her wish--and she gets noticed by Link who gradually comes to feel quite amorous for Tracy. Love blossoms again when Tracy's friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) falls in love with an African American young man named Seaweed (played so well by Elijah Kelley).<br /><br />As the romances evolve we also watch Tracy get involved with the integration movement and Tracy even participates in a protest march to the TV station where The Corny Collins Show is under strict segregation. Look for a stunning performance by Queen Latifah as the incredible Motormouth Maybelle, a black woman who is understandably angered when the one day blacks are allowed on The Corny Collins Show gets cancelled.<br /><br />The movie is peppered with strong, perky and thoroughly enjoyable musical numbers all of which work marvelously. The dancing on The Corny Collins Show is fantastic; and the choreography overall just couldn't be better.<br /><br />The two DVD \\"Shake And Shimmy\\" version of this release has very fine extras on the bonus disc. (The main disc has some links to interactive websites accessible only through the first DVD.) Look for plenty of material--well over two hours worth--on the making of Hairspray and the evolution of the story from John Waters's movie to Broadway play to this successful remake. Excellent! In addition, it is absolutely amazing what they did to make John Travolta into Edna Turnblad using elaborate makeup, costumes and special prosthetic makeup as well. Wow. The second DVD also has deleted scenes, and feature-length audio commentary from director and choreographer Adam Shankman, star Nikki Blonsky and producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron.<br /><br />Overall, if you want a fun filled comedy with great musical numbers, look no further. The convincing acting truly moved me and many of the issues the film deals with are still being grappled with in our times. I highly recommend this movie.t!

0156027321|2.0|The novel is divided into three sections. The first covers Pi's life as a child growing up at the zoo his father owns, the second is his struggle for survival trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger after the ship his family was migrating to Canada on sinks, and the final section tell of how he narrates his story to investigators from the shipping company.     The story of his travails on the open ocean begins on the border of fantasy and reality, but becomes more and more fantastical as it proceeds, until we are treated to a description of an algae island that could not possibly exist, but is nevertheless utterly fascinating. Pi's struggles with fear and despair center on his efforts to dominate the tiger he is forced to share the lifeboat with. The presence of the tiger gives him purpose and the novel has real moments of beauty where we can see the indomitable nature of the human spirit at work.     Unfortunately, the novel's potential is largely destroyed by two things. The first is the character of Pi himself, who also is the narrator of his own story. He comes across as an irritating dweeb who can, for example, spend two whole pages fretting to the point of distraction that he might not recognize a person he has arranged to meet in a crowded place, when he in fact knows the person extremely well, and whose attempts at humour are feeble at best. The second is that the author attempts to turn parts of the book into a sermon on religion. In the final section the investigators are given a possible alternative story to the one where he is trapped on the lifeboat with the tiger. The second story is ostensibly more plausible and the investigators are asked to choose which they like better. If left at that, the third section could possibly have made an interesting conclusion to the novel, but the author feels he must bash the reader over the head with his own interpretation of which story is better, so we are left with the trite conclusion that just because we have never seen something does not mean we should not believe it. One of the characters at the beginning claims that this story will make the reader believe in God, but such superficial platitudes seem an unlikely way to achieve this.
1570627215|5.0|In Siddhartha, Herman Hesse does a masterful job of taking the reader through a journey of discovery, emphasizing the path to knowledge as much as the knowledge itself. The story roots its magic in common experiences that have a touch of pleasing familiarity, which combined with the masterful prose makes it a must read for any one.<br /><br />Unlike other seekers, Siddhartha, a young restless Samana (wandering ascetic), is not content to be a disciple of the enlightened one, Gotama, the Buddha. \\"You have learned nothing through teachings, and so I think, O Illustrious One, that nobody finds salvation through teachings. To nobody, O Illustrious One, can you communicate in words and teachings what happened to you in the hour of your enlightenment\\". So it is that Siddhartha, intent on finding his own way to salvation, decides to part ways with Govinda, his friend and \\"shadow\\", who has decided to become Gotama's disciple.<br /><br />On his aimless way out of Gotama's grove, the ascetic Siddhartha's awakening comes when he learns to appreciate the beauty in the world around him. Deciding to continue his learning by immersing himself in the world, and not by running away from it, he arrives in a town that would become his home for the next several years. It is here that he meets the beautiful courtesan Kamala who teaches him how to love.  The young Siddhartha also earns the trust of Kumaraswamy the merchant, and becomes a rich man by managing his business.<br /><br />But just when life feels like it couldn't get better, Siddhartha's restlessness strikes again. He remembers the call in his heart that drove him as a youthful seeker: \\"A path lies before you which you are called to follow. The Gods await you.\\" The love for \\"Sansara\\", the pursuit of worldly happiness, dies within Siddhartha and he wanders off again.<br /><br />The wandering Siddhartha meets Vasudeva the wise ferryman, and settles down in his humble abode. With Vasudeva, he learns to talk to the river and learn its secret: that it exists everywhere at the same time, at the source and the mouth, at the waterfall, in the current and everywhere; that only the present exists for it, and that the past and the future were just shadows for it. Siddhartha learns that his life has been like the river: that \\"Siddhartha the boy, Siddhartha the young man and the Sidhartha the mature are separated only by shadows, not reality\\", a discovery that would ultimately lead him to salvation.<br /><br />But Siddhartha's life is interrupted again when a sick and dying Kamala, on her way to see the Gotama, comes across his doorstep by accident. She dies but leaves behind her son, Siddhartha's son, conceived just before Siddhartha left the town.<br /><br />Affection for the child becomes the focus of Siddhartha's life, and it shocks him one day when the child leaves him seeking to make his own destiny. Siddhartha is distraught, but learns from Vasudeva and the river; in the river he sees his own life and how things had come full circle since he left his own father's home as a child.<br /><br />Thus Siddhartha truly learns to recognize life as an endless circle, and to stop fighting his own destiny. That is the moment when Siddhartha rises above the conflict of desires and attains salvation.<br /><br />Even though it deals with a complex subject, Siddhartha is an easy and pleasant read, and I'd highly recommend it to everyone.everywhere at the same time, at the source and the mouth, at the waterfall, in the current and everywhere; that only the present exists for it, and that the past and the future were just shadows for it.

B000VNMMQQ|1.0|I felt compelled to write my first review here because this movie is so awful. TV show production at best, poor acting, lousy script, cheap-looking sets. It doesn't deserve to be mentioned with the other Die Hard movies, and I'm sure that if Bruce Willis ever watches it, he will regret making this travesty. Obviously a quickly thrown together vehicle to cash in on the brand.

This DVD should be a required part of the training of all military officers and civilian leaders.  Yes, there is a lot of battlefield violence,that may be too strong for some, but it is an honest depiction of battle. It is a good reminder of the struggles of our men in combat face.
B00005JPNW|5.0|We are invited to revisit so many old tales like The Wizard of Oz and his Dororthy, or Alice and her Wonderland, or Snow-white and her bad step mother or Cinderella and her own bad stepmother. We must admit we are coming back from very far when we look at the most traditional image of women, or girls, in fairy tales and other children's stories. Think of Little Red Riding Hood who sleeps with a wolf, or Sleeping Beauty who cannot but prick her finger on the first spinning wheel she meets. This tale is for girls and this tale is built on a couple. On one side the bad guy, Marisa Coulter, and on the other side the good girl, Lyra. Refreshing. To make it modern and charming the author adds two elements. First animals who are fascinatingly good on the good side and outrageously bad on the bad side, with the polar bears in between, good or bad according to the king they have. Animals have always fascinated children. Then some good special effects to make the movie a dreaming machine with all types of possible fantasies and visions beyond the surface of things. The film is thus conceived as a mirror handed and stretched out to girls for them to fall in the Wonderland it proposes. At the same time it is modern too and tries to get the boys in the theaters by having some good battles, particularly the general one between Marisa Coulter's army and the gypsies who are on the right side and helped by the bears. There definitely is some charm in this film and girls are coming back to the forefront after a long long absence from it. Dorothy and Alice were so long ago. Unluckily we will have to waif for some time if we want to know whether Lyra will save her father or not. That's the only thing I regret. The general meaning is that a child, a girl as well as a boy, must remain rebellious and must disobey orders from adult authority because that adult world is hiding the truth of life and is aiming at cutting these children off (castrate them in a way) from their wild, free and imaginative animal spirits. We have to save children from normalization and standardization, so that they can forever see the cosmic dust that surrounds us and follow the tracks of the golden compass of their imagination and dreams.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesaginative animal spirits.

B000002LOM|5.0|This is one of Moz' best albums IMHO. I see that people complain about the sound, but I have no problem with it. I am also not a soundboard tech so take it for what it is worth. This album has some of the sharpest lyrics of his career, skewering stupid boyfriends, boorish conversationalists, media-types, and, of course, himself and his own pretentious. His voice is wonderful as usual, his delivery is on target. The music is such that one could often tap one's toe if one desired. I particularly like the slinky bass on \\"Found Found Found\\". If you are a sensitive soul, battered by life, and are looking for some music to get you through the tough times, you need to buy all of Moz' early albums, including \\"Viva Hate\\", \\"Your Arsenal\\", \\"Vauxhall and I\\", \\"Bona Drag\\", and of course \\"Kill Uncle\\". As a dreary young lad, I would often find myself thinking of one person or another who had done me wrong while singing along with Moz, spitting venom and feeling quite the better for it afterwards. I can't imagine how many others had Morrissey for their own personal psychoanalyst in just the same way. A very good album so buy it.

0131479415|5.0|This Robert C. Martin Series text by Mike Cohn has been unfairly criticized by previous reviewers. The content in general is very well written, and the subject matter flows very well from topic to topic. In my opinion, there is some missing detail that could have served well those readers new to the topic of estimation. In light of this observation, I think that \\"Software Estimation - Demystifying the Black Art\\" (see my review for that work) can be seen as a companion text to \\"Agile Estimating and Planning\\". Mike Cohn simply focuses on agile projects, so if such projects are the primary focus of the reader, they might otherwise get caught up with detail that is not necessarily within their domain. From my experience, however, it will serve the agile practitioner well if they understand some of the theory behind the practice of general software project estimation. Of course, Mike Cohn also provides a considerable portion of the book to agile planning in general, and this topic is what makes the book unique in 2007. While other books of this genre can be expected in the near future, the seven parts of the discussion cover the subject matter well: \\"The Problem and the Goal\\", \\"Estimating Size\\", \\"Planning for Value\\", \\"Scheduling\\", \\"Tracking and Communicating\\", \\"Why Agile Planning Works\\", and \\"A Case Study\\". Each of these parts build upon its predecessors, finally culminating in a case study. I found especially valuable the discussions on agile planning in general, the different methods of agile estimating, how to prioritize deliverables, project schedule iterations, velocity, and tracking. Throughout the text, the author provides dozens of examples  with just the right amount of tables and diagrams to aid the discussion. This book is a relatively easy read for a wide audience, and the quotes shared at the beginning of each of the chapters provide a humorous (although usually unintentional), realistic look at the philosophy of estimating and planning by individuals not in the software industry. My favorite quotes of the lot: \\"Planning is everything. Plans are nothing.\\"; \\"A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week.\\"; \\"In a good shoe, I wear a size six, but a seven feels so good, I buy a size eight.\\"; \\"Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.\\"; \\"There's no sense in being precise when you don't even know what you're talking about.\\"; \\"It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.\\"; \\"To be uncertain is to be uncomfortable, but to be certain is to be ridiculous.\\".n the software industry.

For those of you who ARE critical listeners, with a measly $10 bucks or so, you can treat your ears to musical bliss.

When Peter Parker/Spiderman gets the Venom outfit,he becomes bad! he tries to do terrible to get his revenge on Flint Marco aka the Sandman.  The Black Spiderman suit looks good but It makes him bad.  The love triangles are bad too! Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kristin Dunst) break-up because Harry Osbourn (James Franco) interferes with their love relationship! Gwen Stacy also gets in the way of Peter Park and Mary Jane Watson.  It was very bad and in poor taste.<br />I would not recommend you buy this movie! This is a movie to rent not to buy!  Spiderman 2 (2004) is the best movie in the Spiderman Trilogy!

The person in charge of costumes should be nominated for an Oscar in that category. The scenes of London are very atmospheric and work well. Alan Rickman as Judge Turpen and Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett give respectable performances. On the other hand, there is not a memorable song from the entire movie. Stephen Sondheim may be one of our greatest composers, but I wouldn't know that from the music included here. There is no \\"Send In The Clowns\\" or anything close to it in \\"Sweeney Todd.\\" I was not humming any of the tunes as I left the theatre; I just just glad the bloody mess was over. Yes, everything you may have heard about the blood and gore is accurate and then some.<br /><br />A real disappointment.
0307237699|4.0|I came upon Obama when I moved out to Chicago in 2002. He was a state senator then, and already a mover and a shaker. I told my NY friends, \\"keep an eye on this guy -- he's going to be a national political player.\\"<br /><br />He ran for US Senate, gave a keynote at the '04 Democratic convention, and the rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />I like Obama. I think he is a man of great intelligence and principle. But he is still a politician, and this is a very political book. And that's fine; I can deal with politics and the literature of politics. But our politics of the 21st century mass culture makes an apparent demand that you say only what alienates the fewest. Therefore, you really end up saying nothing. And, unfortunately, that's what Obama does in this book.<br /><br />There is a great deal of platitudinous rhetoric in this book (Who can disagree with healthcare for uninsured children? With opposition to this war? With reform of our electoral system?) but very little substantive thinking. Is there a policy in here you'd like to propose, Mr. Obama?<br /><br />I'd sure like to hear it.
1591396190|5.0|I will not say this book is the defininate guide to success but does provide a new way of looking at the market, in particular an alternative look on the market.    By not only focussing on cost reduction, but more on getting more people interested in your product, this book gives some eye openers.    Even if it's not practical for you, the book is easy and entertaining to read and therefore no waste of time.
B00005OM4K|5.0|A great collection from a great band. The growth of the guys is documented from their teens to the last note recorded on the Mardi Gras album. The power and drive from one of the most under-appreciated rhythm sections of all time. The hard driving rhythm guitar of Tom Fogerty to the fiery vocals of John Fogerty - this is Creedence Clearwater Revival. A short lived, long road collection of all their work that is and will be forever, timeless.

B000N4SADC|4.0|Hiromi has come into her own... She doesn't sound like anyone but Hiromi!!! This release is definately not \\"radio-friendly\\" any airplay would stop short of a miracle. Not sure who her audience is either except a cult following to say the least. In this day and age of \\"dumbed down\\" music offering to the masses, This release seems out of place, (save for if you're a musician like myself) She's a mega wonder around the world except for the USA in which she's relatively unknown..THANX Kenny G. ( & to those who cosider his fluff offerings jazz) I feel that the public would be more adept to embrace her if she maybe changed her line-up of musicians. The concept of \\"Sonic Bloom\\" is her way of solidifying her relationship with her core unit band. Yet I feel that they limit her musical sonic textures, They are proficent musicians, yet are basically nameless-faceless at best. She needs to hook up with other artists/performers on her level of thought and artistry. i.e. Allan Holdsworth, Jean-Luc Ponty, David Weckl, Stanley Clarke,  John Patticcuci,  John Scofield,....More of the heavy-hitters variety. This will enable her to paint a masterpiece of sound with more depth and texture. This is the only thing holding her back in the USA. As guilty though it seems but most people are drawn to name association and she has NONE.<br />A few collaborations will certainly give her name/career a big-big-big shot in the arm.
B00004Y2FT|5.0|One hundred, two hundred years from now (if the human race lasts that long!) the CTs will be seen as one of the most influential music groups of this era. Musicologists will do for CT what they did for JS Bach, i.e., pull them out of relative obscurity to a dominant positiong in humanity's all-time music catalog. At his death somebody had ranked Bach as 100th in just Germany alone(!!!); but the sheer power of his music couldn't be supressed. Same with the CTs. Time will tell, but I'm fairly certain I'm right. In addition I'd say the CTs use the electric guitar in its most original, native, intended form. Similar users might be (at times) Neil Young, TD's Edgar Froese, and Michael Brook. Others, no matter how fleet of finger, are transcribers, appropriators of other instruments and styles. Not that there aren't brilliant musicians playing e-guitar, but the vast majority simply transcribe acoustic guitar...which results in the loud, bent, distorted acoustic guitar music we've come to love so much. The CT guitars (Guthrie mainly) rarely if ever borrow, transcribe, approriate, which is one of the freshest ingredients to the CT sound. As far as their originality is concerned, it borders on otherworldly. I run a little Gedanken-experiment on \\"rock genre\\" music: If you are familiar with Led Zepplin's \\"Battle of Evermore,\\" there is a section towards the end where Plant goes off on a near psychotic screeching tangent. It's wonderful, breathtaking, a stroke of genius, etc. etc., but mainly totally out of left field. It's this song's extreme tangent-izing that is so much an Eno-esque \\"oblique strategy\\" that I use it as a measuring stick for all manner of genius oblique strategizing. I'm saying the CTs have this Battle of Evermore oblique tangent thing in spades! (I don't mention Eno because the musicologists already know about him!) Somehow the CTs pull out of the aether-void some of the most subtle and sublime tangents there have ever been. In classical music you hear this insome of the more modern French organ composers (Alain, Durufle, etc.) And of course, you can jump at any time into the big discussion of why humans such as the CTs create such music and why our affinity thereto. No doubt this is a mental phenomonon brain scientists will not wrest away from the mysticists for a long time to come.

0767827791|4.0|William Inge's evocative portrait of small-town life, PICNIC, features the blazing star combo of Kim Novak and William Holden.<br /><br />When handsome drifter Hal Carter (William Holden) decides to drop in and visit old college buddy Alan Benson (Cliff Robertson) in his small Kansas town, he ends up turning the head of Alan's girlfriend Madge (Kim Novak) and disrupting the peaceful lives of her extended family.  The action comes to a climax at the Labour Day picnic, where Madge is to be crowned.  As Madge comes to grips with her uncontrollable attraction to Hal; spinsterish schoolmarm Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) conspires to get her long-standing beau Howard (Arthur O'Connell) down the aisle via the shortest possible means.<br /><br />Kim Novak is brilliant as Madge, the young woman torn between the man who can offer financial security, and the penniless drifter who excites her like no-one she's ever met before; Novak plays the conflict of emotions very well.  In 1955, William Holden was a little too seasoned to play the muscly stud, but offers a fine performance as Hal.  Susan Strasberg, as little sister Millie, provides lots of depth with a role that's written as a caricature (the brainy younger sibling marching around in glasses and bluejeans, reading \\"dirty books\\"), yet Strasberg plays the role believably.  Rosalind Russell shines in the role of schoolmarm Rosemary, desperate to marry and leave her rented room (though her performance is quite hammy and broad in some of the scenes).  Betty Field and Verna Felton also provide solid work, albeit in thankless supporting roles.<br /><br />Although the CinemaScope visuals take some of the impact away from the claustrophobic view of small-town life that's being depicted in the story, the wide ratio displays Kim Novak to her utmost advantage (not to mention William Holden, who sheds his shirt in several scenes).  George Duning supplies the evocative incidental and jazz score, which features \\"Moonglow\\" in the Labour Day dance segment.<br /><br />In the tradition of \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\" and \\"Suddenly Last Summer\\", PICNIC is a searing romantic drama you're sure to fall in love with.  The DVD includes bonus poster gallery and animated photo montage.  (Single-sided, dual-layer disc).the tradition of \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\" and \\"Suddenly Last Summer\\", PICNIC is a searing romantic drama you're sure to fall in love with.

B000V69900|5.0|This short-lived John Mayall band line-up includes Peter Green, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood, which are the original bandmembers, minus Jeremy Spencer (and later Danny Kirwan), of Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac. (To those who are unfamiliar with early Fleetwood Mac, this is the original line-up of a quitessential britis blues band, probably one of the best of its kind.) Although Mayall does the vocals and harmonica, and the album owes a certain adherence to forms taken by his early Bluesbreaker albums, I consider this to be perhaps the greatest Fleetwood Mac album; although considering their more famous pop output, that is a lot less of a compliment than it should be.
B000AARKOO|5.0|I don't know why people would have anything negative to say about movies like Troy and Kingdom of Heaven.  At any rate, Kingdom of Heaven chronicles the 12th century Crusades and bears witness to the great Muslim leader Saladin's conquer of Jerusalem.  The movie is packed with action and battle sequences.  There is really nothing negative for me to say about this movie.  I encourage anyone to add this movie to their collection!

080701429X|4.0|For all its complexities and mysteries, life boils down to one aspect that should ALWAYS allow a human being to keep his dignity if nothing else:  We have the ability to react to any situation any way we want.  That is, even in the awfulness of the Nazi extermination camps, a person can still keep his dignity if merely by being able to control how he reacts to a situation.    Also, Frankl continously refers back to a qoute by Nietzsche that says, \\" He who has a WHY to live for can bear any HOW.\\"  In a concentration camp, Jews often found that the will to live no longer existed within them.  They had lost all hope and it was their despair that often led to physical illnesses that led to their death.  As a response, people like Frankl tried to reinforce to their friends that they did in fact have something to live for.  That \\"something\\" could be their family back home, their kids, their other loved ones, their careers that they may be able to once again resume after the war, etc.  Now, one may question how this relates to his main idea of people reserving the right to react to any situation however they choose to. Well, Frankl argues that once a human has hope, that is the WHY to live for, then he can bear just about any HOW.  That is, no matter how long the SS made the Jews stand out in the bitter cold, often with no shoes, and no matter how often they whipped them and kicked them and punched them, it was always the victim's right to react to those situations as he wanted to.  Whether it was by giving up and perishing or by replying with even more fervent prayer and hope that they will once again be reunited with their loved ones; therefore, survival, Frankl argues, is up to the individual.      The first section of the book is divided into three periods of a \\"prisoner's\\" life; the period of shock, the period of being a prisoner, and the period after liberation.  Frankl provides specific examples for each period and then ties them back into his main idea.  The secondpart of the book explains Frankl's notion of Logotherapy.  I found this second section to be not as important as the first section, because I'm not really interested in psychology.      If I had been asked to only rate the first part of the book, I would have rated it 5 stars; however, the second part of the book isn't as interesting.  I would recommend that you read this book either before or shortly after reading \\"Kaddish for an Unborn Child\\" by Imre Kertesz.  You will find differing philosophies on what happens to the human mind during such tragic and degrading conditions as were the Nazi extermination camps.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|The answer to this question will probably tell you whether or not you will enjoy this movie.  If you are undecided or believe that Global Warming is in fact real, then it is your duty to watch Inconvenient Truth produced by Al Gore.  If, on the other hand, you believe that Global Warming is a propaganda tool used by the left to scare people then pass on this movie.  I belong to the former section of people.    This documentary/film attempts to inform the viewer of the changes in climate being experienced around the Globe.  Al Gore shows actual footage of icebergs melting and animals struggling to survive in their changing environment.  The only reason why I didn't rate this film 5 stars is because I didn't like the fact that solutions weren't really provided.  For example, we are told to minimize our impact on the environment but not really told how, other than generic ways (e.g. save gas, turn the water off while you brush, etc.).  I hope that Al Gore makes another film on the subject, but this time with a focus on what the individual can do to help solve the problem.    Overall, I recommend this movie that either believes that Global Warming is real or is otherwise undecided.

B000QXDED6|5.0|I was looking through all the products I have reviewed and I was amazed to see that I had yet to review my favorite movie of all time!  \\"300\\" is a movie that is very loosely based on the 480 B.C. Battle of Thermopylae.      300 chronicles the the rise of Leonidas from young boy to King of Sparta.  The film also portrays the culture of Sparta, especially as it relates to their superstitions and their notion of the Spartan supremacy.  The battle scenes are excellent and the special effects are second to none.  If you are the last person in the country to not have watched 300, you need to do so as soon as possible.  Else, buy this film as it will be the cornerstone of your film collection!
B000YENUI6|3.0|WIth all the critical praise--and being a big fan of \\"A History of Violence\\", I went in with high expectations and hopes.  I left the theater going \\"huh? what was that?\\"      The movie has great elements: Viggo Mortensen is just great, and in my view the most interesting actor around presently (I think the Ring movies worked as well as they did especially because of his contribution); the insiders view of the Russian mob was very intriguing as was the explanation of the tatoos.  The acting was generally excellent and violence was grippingly real.      The main problem is that for me, the script just didn't work. The whole plot around Naomi Watts (who I also love as an actress) seemed forced and the ending (which I can't reveal) just seemed tacked on. I thought as the closing credits appeared, \\"this is it?\\".    Of course, everyone is talking about the famous nude fight scene in the bath house. It worked very well, but I think it is being over-hyped.    In general, I left the movie disappointed and unfullfilled--although I can tell I will be in the minority with this opinion!
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I really do not know why there are so many haters of this movie.  I really think that it has something to do with Brad Pitt.  I am sure that there are plenty a men out there that don't feel adequate next to Brad Pitt, much less when he is playing Achilles the undefeatable warrior.      This movie chronicles the struggle by Agamemnon of Greece to take control of Troy, using the pretence that his brother Menelaus' wife was stolen by prince Paris of Troy.  Achilles is a Greek whom goes to fight the Trojans but is just not motivated or supportive of the effort; however, during one battle Prince Hector, a famed warrior of Troy kills Patroclus.  This occurence sends Achilles into a rage and he sets out to kill Hector in what is the best scene in the entire movie.    Brad Pitt (Achilles) shows up outside of the Trojan wall and for whatever reason Hector comes out to fight him.  This is by far the best battle scene in the movie.  Achilles kills Hector then drags him back to the Greek camp.  Without their leader Hector the Trojans are doomed.  The rest of the movie follows the book pretty closely.    I highly encourage adding this movie to any DVD collection.

Love the \\"sky-strip\\" organization, that makes it usable at all hours of the night and in every season.   Also, the green lines connecting the familiar constellations make   it easy to understand the reasons for some of the names, eg Gemini and Ursa Major.    An excellent useful book.

B000VNMMR0|5.0|The plot is full of holes and the plausibility is past nil but that comes with the territory. This is a Die Hard movie and as a Die Hard movie this action gem excels on all counts, or should I say fires on all 8 super charged cylinders.  I have nothing but admiration for Bruce Willis to convincingly carry-off the role of John McLane after such a long hiatus. All the old dynamics that we come to expect are there but the real sauce of this story is watching the iconic 1980's hero cope and clash with hip cyber culture.  Great fun.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is a very unique game. It is very easy to learn but hard to master the subtleties of the game. It has several things that make this game unique. The main thing that makes this game unique is that the board can be different each time you play the game. The five land types that each produce a different resource are shuffled each time you play the game. So the board ends up being different each time the game is played.    Another variable is the numbers that you lay down on the land types. The numbers are also shuffled each time. When you roll the dice, what ever number comes up, the land or lands with that number on it produce their resource - regardless of who's turn it is. So you opponents can actually help you on their turn.    A third variable is ports. If you have a settlement on a port you can trade two of one type of resource you have for one you need with the bank. Normally you have to trade four of one resource, to get the one resource you want if none of the other players are willing to make a trade with you.    The fourth variable is the thief. Anytime someone rolls a seven on the dice, they get to move the thief off off the property that he is on, and move it to any other piece of property and to take away one card at random from the hand of any players that have a settlement on that property. The thief automaticly steals what ever is produced on that piece of land for as long as he is there. This denies your opponents precious resources that they need to build roads,settlements, cities, and buy development cards.    Development cards are soldier cards that you can buy to chase off the thief off your property and on to one of your opponents properties. Another type of development card is a victory point card that gives you one point toward the ten point total that you need to win.    Settlers of Catan is designed for 3 to 4 players but you can have up to 8 players with the expansion pack.

And not since The Phantom of the Opera, which is also endowed with Gothic sensibilities, have I enjoyed a musical as much as this.<br /><br />I know Johnny Depp was initially nervous about singing in this film but I thought he did amazingly well, as did Helena Bonham Carter and the rest of the cast. It's a bloody, quirky, dark humored movie that, if nothing else, will make you think twice about eating meat pies.
0895260131|4.0|Jammed with facts, irrefutable even by apologists suffering Stockholm Syndrome regarding Islamists (if they think I side with them, they won't behead me right away). But facts alone are useless in the hands of us credulous moderns. We tend to believe what talking heads tell us in fact-free orgies of opinion.    Fifty years ago, public schools told us people would evolve, that we are getting smarter. El Wrong-O, as it turns out. Nowadays kids have no knowledge of history, logic, music, math or science. Poverty-case schools? Hardly. Corrected for inflation, we spend four times per kid what we spent in the 1950s. And yet, who do we vote for? Marry? What do we buy!     And we geezers are just as guilty of myopic idiocy. Nevertheless, books like this could save us from disaster. More, please! At Amazon prices. why wait?

B0000025P9|5.0|Rock music has never been at the top of my list. It's always been too noisy, too busy, too superficial, and usually too gross to collect my interest. I bought this album years ago. I can't get rid of it; I always come back to it. And it's always refreshing. There is genuine musical talent and ability in every track. And in every track, there is careful, intelligent development and well-balanced musical form. These guys came up with some very fine melodies, such as the touching intro in \\"I Won't Hold You Back\\". \\"Africa\\" is a classic, with its endless beat that perfectly mirrors the rhythm of the human heart. The sounds of Toto IV are large and broad, never overpowering, and satisfying in a way that lots of similar work isn't.<br /><br />I am neither an expert nor am I musically well-educated. There are here a few excellent, well executed reviews of this album. The reviewers make excellent points which I wish I had the perception to make myself. This album is a great example of some of the best of what I, as a classical music fan, like to call modern music.<br /><br />Beethoven--if I can be a little bold about this--would have been fascinated with the sounds on Toto IV, a collection for the heart and the intellect. To my ears, this is classic rock in the strictest sense of the terms.

6305064490|5.0|The incomparable Jimmy Stewart stars as everyman George Bailey, an adventurous dreamer in his youth who feels repeatedly held-down and shackled by a small-town life that he cannot seem to escape throughout his adult years. A group of angels look down on George as he grows from boyhood to adulthood and experiences wonderful moments brought about by seeming defeats and sidetracks from his own hopes and dreams. When we finally catch up with George in modern-day (the late nineteen-forties), a sudden moment of desperation on Christmas Eve has driven him to thoughts of suicide. Convinced that the world would be better off if he'd never been born, the angel Clarence comes to George to show him otherwise by introducing him to a bleak world that never knew him and all the good that he has done.    Directed by Hollywood fave Frank Capra in 1946, \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" was forgotten soon after its initial release despite being nominated for multiple Oscars. However, an amazing thing happened when the film fell into public domain decades later. Repeat viewings on television gradually made the film a Christmas tradition and one of the most beloved films of all time. To this day, I personally consider it to be the best film ever made (though it is not my absolute favorite film or even favorite Christmas film, but definitely among them). \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" has it all. So many moments of this movie are pure magic caught on film, sometimes even by accident! The performances are fantastic, the passion of the telephone scene is something you'll never forget, and the ending is sure to leave you in tears!     \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" has been released several times on DVD. I still have one of the earliest versions myself, if not THE earliest. Mine is the Silver Screen Classics release by Artisan, and it's quite satisfactory. The double-sided disc holds the film on side A and 3 extra features on side B. The features are the theatrical trailer, a Making Of documentary hosted by Tom Bosley, and \\"A Personal Remembrance\\" hosted by Frank Capra, Jr., which features interviews with Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. Whichever version of the DVD you get though, be sure to get one, because this film is an annual must-watch at the very least! And, if you like this one, look for \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" (1947) and \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" (1947) if you want to have the three best classic Christmas films ever! Actually, I need to pick up those other two myself!

6305907145|5.0|Good modern version.  It took some liberties with the plot.  It cut out several storylines for minor characters which is expected for a movie.  I liked the BBC mini-series better because it was able to develop charatcters & the story better.
0143038583|3.0|So where did that food in the store come from and why should we care?  Doesn't buying \\"organic\\" food help the Earth and keep us healthier?  Isn't ethanol a good thing to burn in our cars to reduce dependence on petroleum and lessen pollution?  Don't the sweeping corn fields of America's heartland epitomize the bounty of the nation's agricultural riches?  In Pollan's words from page 245 of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA, \\"Our food system depends on consumers' not knowing much about beyond the price disclosed by the checkout scanner.  Cheapness and ignorance are mutually reenforcing.  And it's a short way from not knowing who's at the other end of your food chain to not caring--to the carelessness of both producers and consumers.\\"<br /><br />Pollan's book aims at educating us consumers as to at least some of the background behind all those foods lining the grocers' shelves.  It aims at revealing some of the unseen links--including some that are intentionally hidden from us--in a food chain that most people simply accept on faith.  It also highlights some disturbing facts that we food buyers may not always consider: Does the vegetarian understand that transporting those non-local, out-of-season veggies from thousands of miles away required the consumption of hundreds of gallons of petrochemical fuels?  Does the \\"organic\\" purchaser appreciate the fact that most organic products in mainstream grocery stores are outputs of an industry just as huge and just as mechanized as the one producing conventionally grown foods?<br /><br />Read the ingredient labels on those cans and glass jars and plastic containers.  An incredible number and variety of foods now all contain high fructose corn syrup.  Fill your vehicle with gasoline and notice how much ethanol is mixed in with it.  We seldom ponder exactly why corn is appearing, in one form or another, in every corner of our consumer universe.  Pollan offers disturbing reasons, which have much more to do with politics and economics than with nutrition and ecology.<br /><br />The title of Pollan's book is a bit of a misnomer, for, as I have tried in a little way to suggest, there is not one dilemma facing the American food consumer--there are many.  To look again at one of the author's primary examples, corn, one's initial question might well be \\"Why not?  Corn's natural and good for us, isn't it?\\"  Just a few of the many problems with it is that Nature is geared to a multiplicity of plants and animals, and it is their interaction that restores the vitality of the fields; in the natural scheme of life, that which is consumed by one entity is returned by another.  This balance is destroyed by man's artificial monocultures, and the food industry turns to chemical fertilizers, insecticide poisons, and other artifices to bolster continued production. Not only do these practices introduce potentially hazardous elements into what we are eating but neither can they be sustained indefinitely.<br /><br />There are no easy, simple, or definite answers to the multiple dilemmas that face modern consumers of commercial foods.  Multi-product farms that practice careful rotation of crops and animals without reliance upon petrochemical fertilizers and insecticides are few and far between.  Hunting one's own meat raises other considerations, not the least of which are ethical concerns (except for those who have convinced themselves that human animals have \\"souls\\" and that non-human animals do not).  Pollan has not found the solutions to our dilemmas, and his book does not presume to prescribe any.  What he has done is to identify at least the major dilemmas facing us in the cycle of food production and consumption, and his book educates us in some of the problems, difficulties and dangers that come with the industrialization of food production.  Inasmuch as we must recognize that problems exist before we can seek solutions, I believe that THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA serves a very useful purpose in raising our awareness ofthose problems.<br /><br />While I do find Pollan's presentation to be valid, enlightening, persuasive and very well illustrated by example, I have to say that, at times, his point becomes dulled through less than scintillating writing.  I was intrigued by his subject, yet I found my attention wandering away from the information here and there because the writing style became, not to put too fine a point on it, boring.  The last portions of the book, where the author takes us along vicariously as he goes hunting wild pig, are highly readable; I wish only that the entire book were so captivating.  There are also a few places where Pollan becomes captivated by a certain term, and he tends to reuse it until the reader wants to send him a Thesaurus with the hope that he will use it to vary his vocabulary.  If the adjectives artisanal, fungible, preprandial, and meaty (describing the taste of morel mushrooms) had appeared less, they would have been much more appreciated.<br /><br />It does help to have a dictionary at hand.  What the heck is prosciutto, and how often does one encounter the word \\"autochthonous\\"?<br /><br />Figuring out the proper number of Amazon stars for this book is not entirely simple either.  Judged by the importance of the book's topic and by its goal of educating the consumer in a vitally important subject, I have no problem at all in giving it the maximum of five stars.  However, considering the effort required to force my attention on some of the less than  inspirational pages, I feel that an overall rating of three stars is more defensible.  Still, whether three stars or five, the book remains an important element in one's education and I recommend it before one eats another meal from a McDonald's drive-through.nd Pollan's presentation to be valid, enlightening, persuasive and very well illustrated by example, I have to say that, at times, his point becomes dulled through less than scintillating writing.

B000E5KJD4|5.0|having seen phantom on broadway a number of times this rendition is just excellent.  it actually clarifies some parts of the story I missed in a live broadway performance.
B00005JPNW|5.0|I'd tried to read THE GOLDEN COMPASS by Philip Pullman at an earlier date on the recommendation of a friend.  I just couldn't hammer my way through it.  The prose seemed too dense, or the pacing was too slow, or there were too many things coming at me at one time.  Whichever it was, I put the book aside.<br /><br />I never found out that one of the characters was an armored polar bear that was a king who'd been kicked from the throne.  I didn't find that out till the trailers started airing.<br /><br />Then, while in San Diego at ComicCon, I ran across the huge display they had up for the movie.  I gawped.  I don't often get to write that word, but it's the only one that fits when you turn a corner and run into a gigantic polar bear nose-to-nose.<br /><br />So I was a tad more curious.  Then my 10 year old started seeing the trailers and I found out what the polar bear was all about.  And we saw the trailers in the theater.  I was blown away.  The hook had been set and my appetite thoroughly whetted.<br /><br />A few days before I went to see the movie, I heard there was an anti-Christian theme tied to it and a lot of people were going to boycott the film.  I was really curious at that point.  I'd expected a lot of fallout over THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, but people seemed to be okay with that.<br /><br />Anyway, I tend to make up my own mind about such things.  So I went.<br /><br />I had a blast.  So did my son.  And I didn't see any anti-Christian themes in the movie.  Sure, the Church was kind of represented as the bad guy, but only if you think that was your church.  Dan Brown did a lot of church-bashing in his book, THE DA VINCI CODE, which was way more edgy in my opinion.<br /><br />I chucked any theological assumptions at the door and just enjoyed the computer-generated imagery, fantastic characters brought to life by exactly the right mix of actors and actresses, and had a grand adventure in a world that was brilliantly different than my own.<br /><br />Dakota Blue Richards was absolutely marvelous as Lyra.  Ian McKellen provided the perfect bear's voice for Prince Iorek Byrnison.  Sam Elliott (one of my absolute favorites) played Texas aeronaut Lee Scoresby.  And Nicole Kidman was marvelous as the villainess, Mrs. Coulter.  Daniel Craig breezed through his role as Lyra's uncle, Lord Asriel.  Serafina Pekkala portrays the winsome witch queen with proper regal ease.<br /><br />The movie is a road trip, more or less, and Lyra ends up moving from one obstacle to the next perilous path at a constant pace.  Even though the movie is two hours long, I felt like I'd just sat down when it was time to get up and go.<br /><br />In addition to providing an adventurous and headlong story, THE GOLDEN COMPASS also provides a visual feast for the eyes.  The city is stunning in all its detail and beauty.  The mix of Victorian pageantry mixed with steam-punk was outstanding, and there was hardly a scene shot that didn't include some impossible or imaginative thing in the background.<br /><br />The battle at the end of the movie felt like it had a cast of thousands, yet everything that transpired was carefully choreographed.  I watched from the edge of my seat as the events that had been set into motion had played out.  By the time the movie was over, I felt wrung out.<br /><br />I can't say that anyone involved in the movie had ulterior motives for what they did.  What I can say is that THE GOLDEN COMPASS is one of the best fantasy films I've seen all year.  I think it's perfectly suitable for the whole family.<br /><br />Now my son and I are going to have to read the books.  We want to know EVERYTHING that happens, and we don't want to have to wait two years for the next movie.Ian McKellen provided the perfect bear's voice for Prince Iorek Byrnison.

B000VBJEEG|3.0|Both of my children, ages 7 and 4 got bored with this movie. Both wandered away to do something else fairly early in the movie. It was entertaining at times, but it wasnt enough to hold my interest either. The characters are cute and all, but it was just OK.
1593082045|4.0|This is an awesome book. It comes in hardback for a great price and it is huge. I already owned the 1st volume of sherlock holmes too.  The only dispute I had was that this volume and the first volume overlap.  So up to page like 400 or something were stories I had already read in the first volume. But, the second half of the book were stories I had never read, and all in all it was a satisfactory product.

B000RO9VJK|5.0|This book was a real eye opener for me. I assumed I'd build a successful business because I loved what I was doing and knew how to do it well. NOT NECESSARILY SO. This book helped me understand that working IN your business (day-to-day activities) is different than working ON your business (processes, systems etc). A new concept to me. It helped me realize that for me to be successful, I needed to learn how to run a business not just produce the product.   If you're a non-business person who's running a business (like me!) read this book. E-Myth also offers some really great online courses, workshops and personal coaching for those of you who are serious about taking control of your business. Check them out at [...] -- you won't be sorry.
1932100660|5.0|This is one of three must read books!  It will really \\"unconfuse\\" you.  If you are drowning in \\"a sea of very bad information\\", do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK. I have purchased dozens of copies because I keep having to give/sell my copy away to others that are searching for ways to change their lives.
080701429X|5.0|I have to say this is probably the most beautiful book I have ever read and ever will read.  The magnificent way Dr. Frankl took such horrific experiences and turned them into such beauty is astounding and inspirational to me.  It helps one who is suffering to see the greater good in everything, and how every bad experience can conjure some positive outcomes in all of us.  Everyone should read this book at least once in their lives.  Viktor Frankl is my hero.
020530902X|4.0|A copy of this book should be in every writer's library.<br /><br />Experienced writers will find much of what is in this small book to be redundant. Even so, this book is a very useful resource. I keep a copy nearby all the time and skim for reminders and tidbits of information that I either did not know, or had forgotten.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|A delight from beginning to end!  Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon have great chemistry.  They both seem to love the fun of it all.  All the characters are well cast. The Donizetti music alone is such fun all by itself, but adding the opera itself makes it magical.  I can't imagine anyone who enjoys light opera not loving this.

B000002N2P|4.0|Punk purists love to whine about Green Day, bemoaning the group's \\"commercial\\" sound, juvenile lyrics, and general mid-90s chart success. To which I reply: shut the hell up. Green Day's music may not be for the ages, and Billie Joe Armstrong (their guitarist, lead vocalist, and chief songwriter) may not be a genius, but their music is still some of the best stuff to hit the charts in the 90s. Their songs were fun, catchy, soaked in attitude and backhanded humor, with plenty of crunchy power chord hooks and unforgettable choruses. Sure, a few trillion awful bands followed in their wake, but should we really blame these guys for the actions of their imitators? I say, burn your Good Charlotte discs and get back to cranking Green Day.    Insomniac, the group's fourth album (and the follow-up to the deservedly successful Dookie) serves up fourteen gobs of mouthwatering pop-punk goodness. Sure, it's all pretty derivative- Billie Joe has obviously been paying very close attention to his Ramones records- but it sounds fantastic. If this had come out in 1977, we'd all be hailing it as a classic (albeit a somewhat minor one). Sadly, I guess I'm forced to do everybody's hailing for them. It really is a shame: I wish that more people would give a good listen to the snotty bounce of \\"No Pride,\\" or the rip-roaring (and just plain awesome) putdown that is \\"Stuart & The Ave.\\" \\"Armatage Shanks\\" boasts a hell of a pop hook, and \\"Brat\\" sounds just plain bratty. \\"Stuck With Me\\" is an instantly memorable outcast anthem, and \\"Panic Song\\" features a great tension-and-release structure.     There's just so much fantastic stuff here- if anything, it's better than Dookie. Ignore the negative hype and give it a shot.
0152048049|5.0|For the past 2 decades spiritual/self-help books, audios, movies, live lectures, work-shops, etc. have become very popular. If you follow the creators of such work you'll see a repeating pattern: The first book (or work in other shape and forms ) is a hit, a best seller, a life saver, an eye opener, a path changer and so on. After the success, follows the numerous other books which basically say the same thing with different titles and words . Of course there would also be the \\"The Gift Shop\\" selling hats, t-shirts, coffee mugs, note-cards and all the other \\"Spiritual\\"goodies. Also, if you are willing to spare money, you could get very \\"Special\\" and \\"Unique\\" offers. The at first modest and humble messenger of the so-called spiritual work turns to a famous egoistic person caring more about their fame than their original message.As Kafka says,\\"you can write many books about life but get very little \\"life\\" out of books.  People who really have the intention to be the messenger of what seems essential to them and wish to share their insights and experiences because their sharing is a gift, do not seek money and fame. Sharing love, light, healing and miracles is not and cannot be conditional. It does not seem spiritual  to turn rich and famous and on top of that become distant from people. People like Dr. Schweitzer, Mother Tressa, and many others can and will be famous unintentionally but I seriously doubt that genuine help was not their main intention (their ONLY intention).  All that said, if you read and reread the simple yet profound book, The Little Prince by Antoine De Saint Exupe'ry, you'll see that this short book that can really be for all ages in different stages, carries many gifts without the need of fancy titles, lengthy lectures, gift shops, and sequels. The author of this book is long gone and yet the message of his book is simple, eternal and universal. Most of one can seek in today's \\"New Age\\" heavy books, can be found in this simple, heart-felt and honest book. After all, as The Little Prince says, \\"What is essential is invisible to the eye\\"

0714834491|4.0|All the scraps of thoughts, quotes, illustrations, art, and scientific insights all blend into a very nice amalgam of a book. I didn't read it from cover to cover, but rather opened up somewhere random and read different pieces. The randomness of all the inspirational thoughts allows for this type of reading - I think it actually makes the book even better. It almost works as the mind itself: getting bits and pieces of information to juggle with really gets your creative juices flowing.<br />A must have, and must-random-read, for everyone in the creative industries and arts sector. Not sure about what other people should do with it.
B000OVLNII|5.0|Abraham Lincoln may be the most studied man in American history.  The author deserves credit for taking on a work about a man that is so well known and deeply researched.  The author makes this more than \\"just\\" a Lincoln biography because she frames the story of Lincoln based on his relationship with his greatest political rivals who become some of his closest advisors and friends. An event that seems almost impossible in today's political climate<br /><br />The author takes aim at the popular perception that Lincoln was an accidental President who only ended up in office, when the infighting between the qualified candidates destroyed themselves.  She claims that Lincoln was highly political and was deeply involved in the electoral convention and believed all along that he had a shot as the presidency.<br /><br />While this is not the first Lincoln book I have read, I still found plenty of new items that I did not know. My respect for Lincoln grew as I learned how he continued to lead the nation during times of tragic personnel family loss.  His ability to feel empathy and emotional connection to people was amazing considering it was a time period before radio or TV.  Despite his lack of a formal education his use of the written word ranks among the top of U.S. Presidents.<br /><br />The book is long and dives deeply into the lives of his political rivals/presidential cabinet. It is not a quick read, but by all means a worthy undertaking to start understanding one of most famous, yet still hidden Presidents of the United States.

B000UD0ESA|5.0|I was first in the door opening day when it opened June 1982.    Film SHOULD have done better at the box office.    Still visually stunning.    Film had faults & even in this \\"final edition\\" it still does.    The voice over, a lot has been said about it.  Harrison did should bored when he did it.  When you see the film now without it you can truly say it was never needed.    The unnecessary Joanna Cassidy topless scene, never liked that.  VERY disappointed in editing now a days the film makers could NOT correct the problem with the stunt double with the BLACK wig in for Joanna with RED hair as Zhora is put into retirement.    Good to see interviews with most of the remaining cast.    It claims to be the \\"final cut\\".  Yeah, we will wait & see on that.    And, the DVD package of course did NOT get a chapter search list.
B000056HE9|5.0|THE BISHOP'S WIFE - 1947    RATED - NR but almost certainly G. VERY family friendly.      AWARDS - 1 Academy Award for BEST SOUND & 4 nominations including BEST PICTURE.    THEMES - Faith, hope, love, spirituality.    STORY - This could be subtitled 'be careful what you pray for'. David Niven is the Bishop and he's under a lot of pressure to raise money for a new Cathedral. There is one wealthy donor that can make it happen but it means compromising to satisfy her. This pressure has also put a strain on what has until now been a wonderful marriage. It's also Christmas and his family wants to spend time with him which he doesn't believe he can spare. In desperation he cries out to God for wisdom. He thought he was asking for help in building the cathedral. He received something entirely different. Cary Grant shows up as Dudley the Angel and sets about trying to help the Bishop. He also tries to mend the relationship between Julia (Loretta Young) and the Bishop and finds himself becoming attracted to her. The Bishop also senses this. It eventually comes to a head and leads to a much different conclusion than the Bishop expected. This is a delightful, romantic comedy and should be a Christmas favorite right along with It's A Wonderful Life and other Christmas classics. [...]

B000V8I2QU|1.0|This CD sounds brittle, compressed and over processed.  Shame on Bruce Springsteen for allowing this to be released.  I'm one of those people that still buys CDs and enjoys the improved sound quality over MP3s.  The record industry is helping to destroy the last loyal customers they have by releasing inferior quality.  Don't waste your money on the CD just get the MP3 version.  If the sound quality was at least decent I'd give the CD a 5 for the quality of the songs.
0757302661|5.0|Since I was a small girl and all the way through my early 20's I had a phobia about giving birth.  I would have nightmares and wake up upset that I would never have children.  Flash forward to a couple of years ago.  My hubby and I planned a pregnancy and I decided I would just go for it and hope for the best.  I decided to take a class in Hypnobirthing and it changed everything for me.  This is a book that empowers and comforts the pregnant mom.  You'll learn that your body is designed to birth and if you get out of your own way and let it do it's work, you'll have a positive birth expereice.  I went from being terrified of birth, to delivering my little girl in a joyful, calm, and drug free way.  I simply didn't need any pain medication.  In my birth video I look like I'm asleep between the pushes, I'm so relaxed!  I still can't believe it!  Read the book, take a class if you can, listen to the CD, and trust your body.  Self doubt is the only thing that stands in your way.  Even if complications arise in your baby's birth, the techniques you'll learn will keep you calm, relaxed, and confident.  Happy Birthing!<br /><br />P.S. - This course is not about choosing to go \\"Anti-Epidural\\".  You can learn these incredible techniques and still make any pain management decisions you wish.  Don't worry.  Just study the techniques and see how it helps you.  I didn't need an epidural because my relaxation was so deep, I didn't have a painful experience (LOTS of pressure but not pain), but you can do what you wish while still having the techniques to keep you relaxed and positive no matter what you choose.  It's not one way or the other.  - I do have to say that it's important that you have a doctor and partner who is supportive of your ability to birth with no intervention.  The doubt of your medical professional, partner, mother, or anyone else in the room can really sabatoge your positive attitude.  If you were running a marathon, would you want someone driving along beside you saying, \\"You'll never do this on your own.  It's going to be terrible and painful!\\"  You MUST have people around you who believe in your ability to birth.ing, \\"You'll never do this on your own.  It's going to be terrible and painful!\\"  You MUST have people around you who believe in your ability to birth.

0920668372|5.0|I received this book when my son was born in 1984, we read it together on every birthday for many years. This book was his, so on one of my birthdays when he was about 11 years old, he purchased this book for me so that I would have my own copy. This was our favorite book, neither of us was ever creeped out by it.  Yes, the driving across town and the ladder is an exaggeration, no one would ever do that and we all know that.  It is meant to show you in no uncertain terms the unconditional love of a parent.  Most everything you see in the movies is an exaggeration but somehow that's okay and people flock to see the crap that is put on the \\"big screen\\"   This book is emotional, touching and full of heart, if you can't see beyond the exaggerations then you are really missing the point.  I absolutely love this book, just thinking about it brings tears to my eyes.    When my son bought this for me as a present, that was an even more emotional time, he does \\"get it\\".  I have purchased this book many times as gifts and will continue to do so.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this as a gift and haven't had a chance to see it myself but my sister recommended it for my 20-year-old nephew.  He was watching it on TV and dragged her in to see it because he was so fascinated.  When his cousin saw that I bought it for him she was quite excited and I asked if she also enjoyed it.  She responded that she hasn't seen it either but when she gave her cousin a ride home for the holidays he raved about it for half the ride (an eight hour drive) so she was very interested in seeing it.  My nephew isn't especially science minded so I think this would make a great gift for anyone with just a little curiousity about our world.
1878424319|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It's also VERY hard (for me at least) put them all into practice. Even though there are only four agreements here... a lifetime of habits is hard to overcome. I CAN say that not taking things personally, learned from this tiny book, has given me enough emotional distance, enough of a buffer to make things people say and do much easier to take. I understand now that it's NOT about me. It's about THEM. That simple distinction makes such a huge difference it's almost beyond belief. Certainly, there are those among us who already know this and have happier lives because they do... but for me, personal comments, behaviors, and circumstances would take me to the depths. That doesn't happen now... thanks to this book.   I'm working on the courage part of the Don't make assumptions agreement. I recognize how assumptions can lead to entire mental architectures based on things that are untrue. I'm tearing those down now. And this book is at the root of a personal transformation for me.
0316172324|5.0|Really liked this book...it opened my eyes as to how we as a society can make assumptions about things very quickly and not really know why. This explains the WHY. Malcolm Gladwell is an excellent writer and I also read his book \\"The Tipping Point\\" which is equally an excellent read. Great discussion book for a book club (nice change from chick lit!)
1580176941|5.0|I am an experienced cook with some professional training looking for all of the great shortcuts an expert in making spectacular looking iced cookies could give.  This book is fantastic, from not one but two experts who've combined their years of practice into one very well illustrated and succinct compendium of all the right facts.  The illustrations are superb, and the pictures not only beautiful but they've made them informative too.  Royal icing is carefully explained, pros and cons of different approaches.  Book contains well written step-by-step time-organized instructions on how to set up for decorating.  Buy this book if only to thank the women who wrote it for doing so many others of us the favor of sharing their hard-earned knowledge.  I own a couple of hundred cookbooks and this is one of the best.  Well done ladies !
B000MRAAJM|4.0|If I could give this 4.5 stars, I would.  Everyone should, of course, buy this series and watch it over and over again.  But it is not the best nature documentary ever.  Just the best one now on Blu-Ray.    To be clear, I am a huge fan of David Attenborough's nature documentaries.  I have watched, multiple times, his Living Planet, Life of Birds, Life of Mammals, Life in the Undergrowth, Life in the Freezer, and Blue Planet series.  I probably have logged hundreds of hours watching them.  To my mind, there is no one alive--apart, perhaps, from E.O Wilson--who communicates enthusiasm for the natural world as effectively as Sir David.  I also have a long-standing interest, albeit an amateur one, in biology and evolutionary theory.  So in light of the abundance of 5-stars reviews, I expected to be blown away.  I was impressed, but not blown away.    In terms of eye-candy, Planet Earth is one of the best nature documentaries ever.  The footage of great white sharks is just jaw-dropping.  As is the footage of the fungus-infected ants, the birds-of-paradise, the bactrian camels, etc., etc.  They are things that only top-notch nature photographers, using top-notch equipment--and waiting days, weeks, or months for the perfect shot--could capture.  And in Blu-Ray, it is spectacular.    That said, there is some truth to other reviewer's complaints about video quality. The footage obviously was taken with different equipment, under different lighting conditions, using different technology, etc.  There are passages--especially low-light scenes--where there is visible noise.  And there are scenes where the producers obviously have used old footage that lacks the clarity of modern high-definition digital equipment.  To be fair, these scenes look bad only because the rest of the series looks so good.  Still, I'm not sure that I would choose Planet Earth to showcase the capabilities of Blu-Ray technology.  A recently produced studio movie--which has the luxury of being lit with artificial light--probably would show better detail.  As would a recent Pixar movie, like Cars or Ratatouille, that was originally rendered in 1080p or better.    The reason why I don't give Planet Earth five stars, though, is not because of its photography, which is first rate.  It is because the narrative lacks the depth and brio of other Attenborough series.  Much of this is because Sir David's role is limited to providing voice-over.  In prior series like \\"Life of Birds,\\" Attenborough appears on-camera, on-location, and provides lucid and personable explanations of interesting natural phenomena--with the animals he is discussing always close at hand.  Sir David is the perfect instructor.  He is urbane and literate, not afraid of getting dirty or putting himself in hazardous situations, and so infectiously enthusiastic about the subject matter that you just cannot stop watching.  Although Attenborough does the voice-over narrative in Planet Earth--at least in this version--he does not appear onscreen and, thus, most of his personal charisma is missing.  He just becomes another nature documentary narrator with a British accent.    It may seem an odd objection to a nature documentary that it lacks a human on-screen presence, but I think it is a valid one.  Having a human--whether Attenborough or someone else--physically present in the environment being discussed provides a sense of connection to an otherwise alien world.  It also provides useful perspective.  Being told the Saraha is 125 degrees in the shade is one thing.  Seeing a person panting and sweating in the heat is another.    In addition, the narrative in the \\"Life of . . .\\" series had much more depth than \\"Planet Earth.\\"  While still being accessible to laypersons, the \\"Life of . . . \\" series spent more time on the fascinating biological details.  There, it seemed like the \\"story\\"--i.e., the biological phenomena--was driving the enterprise.  Planet Earth, by contrast, seems much more driven by the images, and less interested in communicating anything of real scientific substance.  It reminded me a lot of \\"Blue Planet.\\"  Gorgeous photography, but relatively little meat to it.    One final quibble: the orchestration in Planet Earth is too lavish and melodramatic for my tastes.  There are times when I just want to tell the BBC orchestra to ratchet it down a notch or two.  This is a nature documentary, for Christ's sake, not War of the Worlds.    In short, Planet Earth is a beautiful series and looks fantastic on Blu-Ray.  If you haven't done so already, you should hit the \\"buy\\" button.  But Planet Earth is not the be-all and end-all of nature documentaries.  Although they are not quite as visually arresting, the \\"Life of . . .\\" series are, overall, far superior documentaries.  Planet Earth is a gem, but a flawed one.
B000XCZGVI|5.0|Fincher, the director of 'Fight Club', shows his maturity as a filmmaker with this throwback to 70s style filmmaking with a diigital edge.  This movie is to 'Fight Club' what 'There will be Blood' is to PTA's \\"Boogie Nights'.  Years from now, when there is a Fincher retrospective, this underappreciated work will be recognized as a turning point in his career.     I had to post this before this edition came out to counteract the riciculous 1 star review previously posted.
B00005MP58|3.0|I own the Special Edition DVD set.  I enjoy this BBC series very much but boy, the DVD transfer quality is utmost terrible.    Like one of the reviewers mentioned, the color is washed out; the contrast is way off.  The advertised widescreen format is somewhat deceptive.  It looks as though someone chopped off the top and bottom from the 4:3 version.  As a result, in many scenes the heads and feet are chopped from the screen.  The picture looks very grainy and is no where near the quality one may expect from DVD.  Frankly, one is better off to watch the VHS version.    It's unfortunate that we tossed the VHS collection when we bought this DVD set a few years ago.  I should have transfered that into DVDs.    It's still a lovely movie to watch and one may be immensed in the story enough to forget the painful quality... for the most part.

B000ATQYT2|4.0|Jim Henson's ever irresistible Muppets takes on the famous Charles Dickens \\"Christmas\\" classic, with genuinely pleasing results.  The story, as everyone probably knows by now, centers on one Ebenezer Scrooge, a greedy and mean-spirited moneylender who thinks only of money and can only respond to Christmas with \\"bah, humbug!\\"  On Christmas Eve, he receives an unexpected visit from his deceased business partners, who warn him that three spirits will transport him to his past, present, and future.  Grudgingly, Scrooge goes along with the spirits, and eventually realizes that his selfish acts will provide not only drastic consequences for himself, but for the welfare of his long-suffering clerk, Bob Cratchit, and his sickly son, Tiny Tim.<br /><br />The film follows the original tale faithfully, and more importantly, keeps most of the dark, sometimes dreary tone of Dickens' tale.  Since the story has its share of heartbreaking moments, it is surprising that this movie, skillfully directed by Brian Henson, manages to handle them in a very emotional way without coming across as forced or out of place.  Scenes such as Scrooge witnessing the departure of his former love Belle and an even more devastating sequence where the Cratchit family mourns the loss of their beloved, frail son (keep in mind that this is only a vision) all manage to tug at the right heartstrings effectively.<br /><br />Naturally, the Muppets do sneak in ways to provide a bit of humor in various places, but in an adaptation like this, it is most welcome.  Actually, most of the laughs come from the Great Gonzo as Charles Dickens, who narrates the story to a skeptical Rizzo Rat as the latter questions about whether the \\"scary stuff\\" is appropriate for children.  \\"That's all right, this is culture,\\" explains Gonzo, er, Dickens, respectively.<br /><br />It is a treat to see Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy as the Cratchits and even more amusing to see those old tycoons Statler and Waldorf as the ghosts of Scrooge's deceased business partners, but the whole weight of the movie rests on the performance of Michael Caine as Mr. \\"Bah Humbug\\" himself.  He plays the role flawlessly, somehow managing to blend in with his Muppet and human co-stars.  Also noteworthy are the creation of the spirits themselves:  Christmas Past is a ghostly-like child, Present is a jolly, Santa Claus like giant, while Future is a dark-robed, faceless figure who is made all the more scary by the fact that he is mute.  Paul Williams' musical numbers are also very sprightly and infectiously catchy, well-suited to both the spirit of Christmas and the story itself.<br /><br />All in all, THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL is great family entertainment, but even adults may find a lot to enjoy too.partners, but the whole weight of the movie rests on the performance of Michael Caine as Mr. \\"Bah Humbug\\" himself.

0440238609|5.0|Golden Compass is a page turner, I saw the movie after I read it and the movie is good but the book is better, I would suggest people read the book before going to the movie. I am now reading the 2nd book in his trilogy, The Subtle Knife it is good also. It follows along with some of the same characters. Pullman is an excellent writer. Zelma Fobben
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Great box set, especially for your wife at Christmas. I would suggest getting it somewhere else like Best Buy. We got it for $99 on Black Friday and returned the one we bought on Amazon 2 days earlier for $190. Best Buy still has it for $149.99. So even with shipping you are saving $40 over Amazon. I am sure my wife will love it and has been waiting two years for this. I was so lucky to find it for $99...YEAH!

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Planet Earth - The most interesting series ever created for television    I was very interested in the series when it appeared on the Discovery Channel, but was very tired of the amount of advertising that spoiled the continuous of the series.  I decided to purchase the BBC Series for my four children for a Christmas gift, narrated by David Attenborough.  This series contained information that was not available in the Discovery series.  This is such an important documentary, it should be included in anyone's DVD collection.   This is absolutely a FIVE STAR program.
B000O77SRC|4.0|My twelve-year-old son thinks this first \\"Die Hard\\" is better even than the most recent \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\".  That's saying something, since the latest installment has jet fighters, truck crashes, freeway collapses, cool hacker guys and cool hacker bad guys.    This first \\"Die Hard\\" is a classic.  Sure, it's not completely original (what is?), but it puts together fast-paced action, a wise-cracking hero, a skyscraper to fight in (and destroy), and great cop-buddy chemistry.  There's more, of course: 1980s cynicism and corporate greed--but you already know about that.  Don't think too hard--just enjoy it!
1400095204|5.0|\\"Half Of A Yellow Sun\\" is simply brilliant and unquestionably the best book I have read in the past year. Why it eluded the Booker shortlist when others far less deserving made it is beyond me. It did however win the lesser known 2007 Orange Prize award.     The short history of Biafra in the late 60s may have become a footnote in modern history textbooks, perhaps only still living in the memories of those who were around and remember but to those caught in the violent sectarian struggles that exploded among the different communities in Nigeria then, the devastation and horror visited upon their lives and their relationships with people they grew up with couldn't have been more dramatic or shattering. Adichie has written a book with a story so engaging and a theme so universal that you don't really need a working knowledge of Nigerian or African history - though a more than casual acquaintance with it would immeasurably enhance one's appreciation of the intricacies that drive the momentum of the story - to appreciate the colour and splendour of her writing.     Her characters are so vivid and real, so finely etched the reader finds himself making an instant emotional connection with them, making this literary novel read like a political thriller, except that it's deeper and infinitely richer. The plot centers on revolutionary professor Odenigbo and his upper class educated girlfriend/wife Olanna, her non-identical twin sister Kainene and her white boyfriend Richard, and houseboy Ugwu. Cracks in their fragile relationship are apparent even before the country explodes into civil war but when all hell breaks loose, the stresses caused by class, race and ideological differences emerge to the fore that would test their love and loyalty to each other.     Not surprisingly perhaps, Adichie's female characters shine brighter than their male counterparts. They are fuller and better written. Olanna may be the sensitive, black and beautiful twin sister and the nominal heroine,but it is Kainene, her plainer (not so pretty), but stronger and ultimately more complex and fascinating twin sister that provides the moral anchor for the story. Curiously, Richard, the token white character, is weak and vapid compared to the others. The twins' parents are as corrupt and morally vacuous as you would believe them to be. The contempt their daughters feel for them oozes through  every pore of their bodies. Ugwu's subservience, the obsequiousness of Richard's and Kainene's houseboy are painful reminders of the evils of class and colonial domination.     How the Biafran war ended is an established historical fact and nothing would be more boring than for the story to wrap with the predictability of historical fiction, so Adichie who after slyly making us fall in love not with Olanna but with Kainene deliberately leaves us with an unresolved question that will trouble the dreams of the reader long after he's finished the book.     \\"Half Of A Yellow Sun\\" is only Adichie's sophomore effort, yet it's such a brilliantly conceived, perfectly balanced, mature and fully realized piece of work one can only speculate that she will have a long and brilliant career as a novelist ahead of her. Regardless, \\"Half Of A Yellow Sun\\" has already entered the canon of contemporary African literature that must and will be read by generations to come. A vitally important piece of work. I'd give it a 6-star rating if I could.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I had never seen this show when it first ran on TV, so I am enjoying watching the complete seasons on DVD. If you enjoy witty women I highly recommend The Gilmore Girls collection. I watch these with my 3 daughters, ages 10-13, and don't have to worry about the content getting too sexual or drug-related (as Dawson's Creek tended to get). It's got good characters - a bit unrealistic - but that's the fun of it.     If you're out of chick-flicks to watch this weekend, pick up a season of The Gilmore Girls - you'll be hooked! :-)
B000V6BE6C|4.0|Simply stated, im on the fence about the new record. I like some of it; I love some of it, and some of it I don't care for. But I will tell you this, once I saw them play the new songs live last month, the new record is a 10 out of 10. This album doesn't receive justice through your stereo, but after the show I had a different appreciation for it. Truth be told, I felt the same way about City of Evil when it came out. Try the new record, and A7X live is a MUST for any fan, at any age.

Micheal Jackson had a great cd Thriller and after that alot of people thought he had lost it and that his music wasn't as good or shall I say good enough.  I think this is a great cd.
B00065MDRW|4.0|King Crimson was always the most dark, sinister, enigmatic band in prog rock, and this debut is a perfect example of why.  The bleak, wintery aura of this album is in high contrast to the optimistic, intellectual music of Yes or the more upbeat and catchy Rush, and although those bands occasionally tackled very serious and/or depressive lyrical topics (for example 2112), it was never done with quite as much gloom as is found here.<br /><br />\\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" is a deserved classic.  4 of the 5 songs on this album are masterpieces of songwriting, and each of them completely unique.  Not even the instrumentation remains the same. Various wind instruments are brought in when needed.  The greatest strength of this incarnation of the band was their dramatic song structures, and part of what makes them work is their ability to hold back and leave certain traditionally dominant instruments out of the mix (such as guitar) for minutes on end, making it all the more effective when they're re-introduced.<br /><br />Until this point, I'd always said \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" is an album best enjoyed in its original vinyl format, but this new remastered edition adds a sense of space that no previous version of this album has ever had.  The instruments sound much more separated, and for the first time all the various parts are decipherable.<br /><br />First of the album's 4 masterpiece songs is \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\", the most traditionally \\"progressive\\" song on the album.  Blazing horns augment a distorted bass and lyrics about a (not-so-distant anymore) future.  It's the only real technical workout on the album; just listen to the interplay between bass and guitar during the instrumental \\"Mirrors\\" movement.  The use of technicality reminds me of ELP in this case. This song is much more focused on groove and sheer power than expressing any kind of more nuanced feeling.<br /><br />Next is the beautiful ballad \\"I Talk to the Wind\\", and of all the songs it's probably the one that benefits most on this remaster.  The lovely, soft mellotron textures swirl around your ears and then bleed into the backdrop.  The lovely flute lines and guitar leads are the highlights of the song.  It's full of catchy, simple melodies, but also possesses an eerie, haunting atmosphere.<br /><br />\\"Epitaph\\" is a soulful, dramatic piece drenched in orchestration.  Strings, bass clarinet / bassoon and acoustic guitar are the most noticeable.  The lyrical topics are just as huge and epic as the music, and like much of the album focuses on the sad state of our world (\\"The fate of all mankind I see is in the hands of fools\\").  Although it's a longer song (8 minutes), the chord progressions and such are actually quite simple.<br /><br />The title track, \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" has to be heard to be believed.  While the lyrics are more of the same apocalyptic depression that dominates \\"Epitaph\\" and \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\", the recurring chorus is truly triumphant, and although it's repeated at at least 5 different points throughout this 9 minute song (the last time without vocals), it never loses its effect.  The harmonized, choral vocal melody is a stroke of genius.  This track has all the groove and power of \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\", and also the ethereal moodiness of \\"I Talk to the Wind\\".<br /><br />The remaining track, \\"Moonchild\\", is a short (about 2 and a half minutes) melancholic song with a lot of echoed, mournful guitar.  There's no real percussion, focus is on the vocal melody.  The song is quite good, although Peter Sinfield's lyrics are pretty much cheesy mysticism (\\"waiting for a smile from a sun child\\").  It's not on the level of the other 4 tracks, but I would still unhesitatingly give this album a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the full TEN MINUTES of aimless instrumental improvisation (with little variation or coherence) seemingly randomly tacked onto the end of the track.  I heard that this was only includedon the album because the band didn't have enough material.  Whatever the reason, it completely ruins the momentum and focus the album has up to that point.  I can see including a couple minutes of this sort of thing, but as it is, it's longer than any other piece on the album.  At this point, I skip it every time I put this album on, something I rarely do with any album I own.  For this reason, I've knocked a whole star off this album's rating.<br /><br />While \\"Moonchild\\" makes the album as a whole a lot less listenable, it doesn't make the other 4 songs any less brilliant. \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" is still highly recommended, just know that you're getting a track that's 5/6 filler.al.

B000TLTUL0|5.0|As a longtime fan of Stephen Sondheim's musical \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,\\" I've been looking forward to this movie for ages. I was not at all disappointed.<br /><br />\\"Sweeney Todd\\" is an amazing film, and it's almost an exact replica of the Broadway show, which made me very happy. The story is about Benjamin Barker, a.k.a. Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp), a barber who returns to London after being wrongly imprisoned for 15 years for a crime he did not commit. Benjamin was sent away as a result of Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), an evil man who was in love with Lucy (Laura Michelle Kelly), Benjamin's wife, and wanted her for herself. When Benjamin/Sweeney returns to town, he is informed by Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) that his wife is dead and that the judge has taken Johanna (Jayne Wisener), Benjamin's daughter. Sweeney is determined to get revenge on the judge, and he devises a plan with Mrs. Lovett that involves slaying patrons in his reestablished barber shop and sending their bodies down a chute to the basement of Mrs. Lovett's pie shop, where she grinds up the dead to bake into her meat pies.<br /><br />Obviously, this is a very dark film, and I don't think anyone could have done a better job with it than Tim Burton. He remained very true to the musical version and did an excellent job of bringing this gory tale to the big screen. The music is phenomenal, although I was slightly disappointed that the \\"The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd\\" wasn't performed at all (but the music from the song is used throughout the film). Depp's performance as the homicidal barber is by far the best part of this film. I think this may be Depp's finest work to date, and it is definitely Oscar-worthy. (Who knew Jack Sparrow could sing so well?!) Rickman is perfectly cast in the role of the judge, and Sacha Baron Cohen is fantastic in a small but hilarious role as Sweeney's rival barber, Pirelli.<br /><br />The only performance that I was slightly disappointed with was Bonham Carter's. I've always been a big fan of hers, and it took me a while to warm up to her subtle interpretation of Mrs. Lovett. It could be that I'm being too hard on her and comparing her to Angela Lansbury's brilliant performance in the original Broadway production of \\"Sweeney Todd,\\" but even so, I think Bonham Carter could have done a bit more with the role, and her singing voice wasn't all that impressive. However, she did improve as the film went on, and she had some very comical moments, especially in the dream sequence depicting Mrs. Lovett and Sweeney at the sea, which is by far the funniest part of the entire movie.<br /><br />Another gripe I have about the movie is that the ending is very abrubt. It would have been nice to include an epilogue of sorts to let the audience know what happens to the other characters.<br /><br />Overall, despite a few very tiny flaws, \\"Sweeney Todd\\" is absolutely sensational. Those of you with weak stomachs may not appreciate all the blood and gore, but this is a movie about a serial killer barber, so what else do you expect?

How on earth could anyone give this stale slice of mediocrity a favorable review?<br />The acting was so banal it made the second-rate, cheese-ball story line seem Shakespearean. And let me go on record and say the screenplay came across as having been cobbled from every sappy `boy meets girl' endeavor to flop on the wide screen.<br />The music was touted as being so powerful its contribution to the movie may well make it the \\"best musical film of our generation\\". Puleeze!! I noticed a poster of Leonard Cohen's 1973 'Live Songs' on one of the walls in the boy's bedroom . Do yourself a favor and buy the Leonard Cohen album. It's a thing of beauty and will sustain your soul for the rest of your life. Avoid this trite affair at all costs. No should have to suffer thru Once ... not even once.

B000ZN8036|5.0|I guess you would have to have felt the way this young man felt in order to get the film at all- and so I did. In my opinion,it was an amazing story- albeit tragic and frustrating that this obviously intelligent young soul did not come to terms before it was too late for him to turn back. To me, the movie was a statement of reality- how sometimes we think we know it all (yes, we all do sometimes!) and then we must learn the error of our thinking- and hopefully back out slowly and regroup before tragedy strikes us, as it did him.   He took things to extremes- yes, he was that kind of person- stubborn and sure of himself and his convictions, not unlike many people I have met in my life.   I don't see how one could change the story, since it is true, in most parts (other parts must be somewhat speculative because he spent so much time alone!), but I thought a lot was neatly and clearly explained in the voice-over of the sister- and so beautifully written it was, in my opinion.   I, personally was not at all distracted by the writing on the screen-I felt it was just a novel way of piecing things together, almost for efficiency, to get the information out there to the audience in creative ways- at least, that is one way to look at this tactic.   I loved the statement about the crystal- the analogy the sister makes- about how her parents understand that fine crystal needs care, but yet they do not understand the sensibilities and sensitivities of her brother.   As parents, which is what this movie makes me think about most, we do have a responsibility to create nurturing, loving environments for our children. What we expose our children to - namely our own frailties- can be destructive to them- even though we love our children. This is reality, and some of us fail miserably at it.

The thing is is i'm actually applauding the author for his ironic zest and i did not like the books just as he said. Despite a habitual warning every book the readers persisted until the end where they were utterly disapointed. It was almost as if to say \\"nanana na na boo boo!\\" to all the readers who did not heed his solicitations. It made me laugh so thats why I gave it 3 stars. Interesting style but just too depressing!

B000UBMWG4|5.0|Let me explain where I'm coming from first so you can see my point.  I was very late to come to BluRay.  I am an avid moviephile and already had many, many DVDs in my library.  So it was with great reluctance that I bought my BlyRay player.  I bought about 20 DVDs right off the bat, most of them being the ones that were supposed to make the most of the format, including Fifth Element, 300, Planet Earth series, and the Pirates/Carribean series.  Now these movies did look and sound great, but I didn't think they warranted the huge upgrade in price.  Thankfully, Close Encounters came out and was SUPERB!  That was my fave until now.    Blade Runner is the BEST BluRay transfer I have seen to date.  And by a huge margin.  In the first 10 minutes when you see that dark cityscape you'll be in awe.  When Batty and Sebastian cruise up to the pyramid, the detail of the pyramid is breath taking.        As for the content, note that only the movie in all it's versions are bluray.  The discs with the extra content are NOT bluray even though they are included in the bluray set.  Not that they really need to be.    The story of the FInal Cut?  Brilliant. I loved Blade Runner and at 39 was a product of the 80's.  I used my swingset for the Millenium Falcon.  I was immersed in the Sci Fi of the day.  Even at that young age I love Blade Runned.  But this new \\"Final Cut\\" version really isn't just another rehash.  It's far more mature and more dark than it's original release.  Most notable is the absence of Deckard's constant inner monolgue/narration of the film.  No \\"driving into the sunset\\" happy ending.    So in conclusion, if you want a bluray disc that will really show off your system and amaze your friends, then Blade Runner is it.  If you're an avid fan of them film for years and are wondering if it's worth buying...yet again, then it most certainly is.  The quality is worth it alone, but the recut is actually very lovingly done.  All in all a true masterpeice of BluRay and it has raised the bar for what older movies can look like if they spend the time/money on them to make them look great.    I can't recommend this particular title strong enough.

B00000IL1K|5.0|I had always enjoyed Sarah Brightman's performances in musicals.  'Phantom of the Opera' was a personal favorite.  When I saw this title I bought it on a whim to see what her contemporary music was all about.  Turns out it is FANTASTIC!!  Even her rendition of 'My Heart Will Go On' (done in Italian (I think) blew me away...which is saying a lot considering I tend to switch channels if the original comes on the air.  Give a listen on the product page or take a copy home to see for yourself.
B000VNMMPM|3.0|\\"Angel-A\\" is something that I would never expect from a guy who is well-known for his films such as [[ASIN:B0006GVJEE Jean Reno's Greatest Hits]] and [[ASIN:B0006GVJE4 Petite Redhead Clone Bares All]].  The film's a subtle romantic-comedy about a guy discovering his sense of well-being and a lady who helps him find it, completely opposite of Luc Besson's usual sound and fury of his past action films he wrote and/or directed; not to say there's no violence in the film, but the only violent moments in here are just comical sucker punches.  I certainly like the film's stylish noir look and it has its fair share of good laughs, but I don't think Bessie succeeded in making a heart-felt story.<br /><br />One thing that bothers me with this movie is Andre, the film's main street rat.  After failing to provide the cash needed to pay the huge debts from punks and mobsters, he's about to throw his life away from a bridge when a beautiful, tall blonde decides to jump in first and he saves her life from the depths of water. Angela, the woman he saved, owes him and starts helping him with his dilemmas, but what he didn't know at the time was that he saved a guarding angel (that would be the movie's \\"twist\\", but the movie's title and its visual metaphors doesn't even try to make the twist subtle).  I don't mind the whole \\"guardian angel\\" angle, if it makes the victim learn about his weaknesses and stand up for himself, but for the most part Angela is played like his scapegoat.  From beginning to end, Andre is almost dependant on her; even at the moment where he has the inner-strength to face his adversary, it was Angela that helped his way.  He's basically walking the red carpet towards his self-importance rather than him taking the beaten path to actually learn his lesson.  It doesn't help that Andre's rather unlikable, as he comes off as rather selfish and clingy, even when he's seeing the light.<br /><br />I do appreciate whoever played Angela, who's more of a man than Andre is.  She can be so dominative whenever she helps the short one, but there were a few moments in the film that her tragic side makes me pity her; it's doesn't hurt that she has a bit of a spunk.<br /><br />The \\"Making-Of\\" feature on this DVD is more compelling than the movie itself, because this is the first time that I get to see Luc Besson behind-the-scenes.  Although he never discussed about the film on-camera (no surprise, he hardly does on any of his films), seeing his face and him chatting with the cast & crew during production is about as up-close-and-\\"Besson\\"al as it gets.  The bonus feature also interviews the two main cast members, talking about how great it is to work with the director and how intricate the story is.  I was never too interested in what they had to say, I just like to see Besson gettin' large and in charge.<br /><br />Despite the fact that \\"Angel-A\\" made it too easy for itself and the perception that it's a glorified \\"boy-meets-girl\\" tale made the film seem desperate, I don't think it's a bad movie. I kept going for the beautiful black-and-white cinematography and some interactions with Andre and Angela, like the betting horse scene, were amusing.  The music is pretty decent, but it disappoints me that Eric Serra didn't score this film, and he had a history with Besson.  Overall, you should give this movie a rent.o dominative whenever she helps the short one, but there were a few moments in the film that her tragic side makes me pity her; it's doesn't hurt that she has a bit of a spunk.

B000FVQYYK|4.0|I was looking for some new music one day, and I came across English rock band Muse and their latest album, Black Holes and Revelations. I picked it up and it's damn good, if not the most accessible (more on that later).<br /><br />Leader Matthew Bellamy and the rest of the trio experiment with a variety of musical ideas, as you'll find elements of different genres on here. Fortunately they impress, whether it be jazz (\\"Soldier's Poem\\"), hard rock (\\"Exo-Politics\\", which sounds a little like System of a Down's \\"Chop Suey\\"), or even hip-hop (\\"Supermassive Black Hole\\"). Other highlights include \\"Starlight\\" (the song that inspired the album's title) and the closing track, \\"Knights of Cydonia\\".<br /><br />Speaking of that song, the reason why this album might not be the most accessible is because, well, although it's definitely above-average, it feels like the songs would sound even better if you saw the band perform them live (thus, it would be easy for them to then follow track 1's advice and take a bow). To that end, while casual listeners might need to hear Black Holes and Revelations more than once to really get into it, I think it should fit in well with your Arcade Fire and Decemberists albums.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I am first and foremost an avid Bruce Springsteen fan. With that said, this album per; the songwriting and performances are excellent. I love this record.I own both the CD version and the Vinyl edition of this record. I was sitting with  my headphones on the other day listening to the vinyl copy I had just picked up.Immediately I thought, \\"Is this a different mix? This sounds great. More guitar detail and the drums and bass are crisp and clear.Very excited, I headed out to take care of a few errands and picked up a sandwich, parked in a favorite spot. and popped in the CD. Oh sure, I enjoyed the listening experience. But, Then I went home and listened to the CD on my stereo. The same stereo that had played the vinyl version earlier in the day.I decided that I would commit myself during my free time to perform and A/B test.The vinyl edition of this album is superior on all levels. You hear the air, the soul, the power of The E-Street Band laying down the tracks.The most important elements of the recording are balanced and pure.I love it!! You will too...on vinyl. Get a turntable folks. All Mp3's are a terrible sounding mess. Start hearing the true sound of recordings. Not digital data through earplugs.

B000Y7U98C|5.0|The only way I was let down was by how I read so much about the film before I saw it. I wish I would have just watched it and then read about it. The cinematography is unreal, the story is riveting, in other words... perfection!!! Danny Boyle doees it again. Cillian Murphy is phenominal, as is the rest of the cast. If you love Sci-Fi this is a must have!!! Awesome!!! The story pulls you in enough to make it plausable and the visuals will blow you away!
B000Y1ZXU2|5.0|Well to start off I was thinking they were gonna show the vicarious video that is already been shown online. I was wrong, very wrong, the new video is a step up from previous Tool videos in technology and visual art. As in all Tool videos it makes unnerving visuals seem normal in Adam Jones's view of art. The extras are fantastic, their is a biography of the video and a nice background of Adam Jones's previous work on his art in some visuals for film and Tool albums. Also the feature CoSm is a display of a museum in New York inspired by Tool and art for 10,000 Days. The commentary for the video is by comedian David Cross, which is pretty funny as he pokes fun at himself and the visuals of the vicarious video. The packaging of the DVD comes with stereo scopic lenses to make Jones's art three dimensional as it was in 10,000 Days. All in all Tool has provided a great piece of work for fans to speculate and put on the shelves next to 10,000 Days.
B000065BPB|5.0|I ALMOST bought noise-cancellation headphones and kept reading the reviews about the Sennheiser HD-280 for less than half the price of the electronic ones.    Then, I read about the electronic ones and how the Sennheiser's were just better, plus no batteries to deal with and they are foldable - but again, these are just headphones, not actual noise-cancellation ones.    Well I had a 14 hour plane trip and decided to buy these and they are great.  I also shoot guns at an indoor range and have passive \\"noise suppression\\" over the ear - ear mufflers too.  The Sennheiser HD-280 isn't the same, but comes remarkably close.    I've worn these for about 10 of those 14 hours and I was fine, but if you have a larger than average noggin I could see where these would cause discomfort.  The fold and twist so it slipped into my laptop bag with ease.  Sound quality is superb and the side effect is passive noise suppression too.  I'll take these on every plane trip from now on, with or without music.    p.s. The fact the actual cord can be replaced was another plus - headphones are only as good as the actual cord - this is some smart thinking by Sennheiser!
B00000JY1X|5.0|If you like the Magnetic Fields, (or if you appreciate quality music at all), then you would love this box set.  The Magnetic Fields sing about love and happiness/unhappiness, but they do so in a quirky and entertaining.  Most of the songs are very short (two to three minutes) and non- repetitive, however there is one longer song (I think it's about eight minutes) in the set.  I love 69 Love Songs and I strongly encourage others to listen to it.
B00005OM4K|5.0|I love CCR and I saw Fogerty three times in concert and this box set brings back memories from those shows. The sound is excellent and the Live and Pre-CCR material make this set a worthwhile purchase.
B000X418UE|5.0|The Rock still stands, even after all these years, as one of my favorite films of all time. Sean Connery still dominates the screen, while Nicholas Cage plays the dim-witted genius who tries to save the day. The action scenes are mind blowing and the story is well thought out. I give it 5 out of 5 only because I can't give a 10 out of 5.
B0009F9O08|5.0|This album was derided when it first came out as being a little \\"rough\\" around the edges.  That's what makes this cd so awesome and listenable now! Bowies voice is great... a little huskey, but nonetheless,sexy and hot! As others have pointed out the musicians are superb and beyond compare.  A great edition to any Bowie fans collection!
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Another skillfully produced documentary, including \\"real\\" people drammatically affected by the imperfections of the Healthcare system, the Politicians who appear to have been swayed by that powerful lobby, and Mr. Moore himself.<br />I learned alot about the \\"imperfections\\" - some might say that's an infuriating emphemism. I was not aware that a company could rather unaccountably dismiss an applicant who actually agrees to shell out a fortune for coverage. Did not know that people, with apparently no one to watch their backs, are almost literally dumped off at a hospital or clinic, when a facility decides there's a space problem, or something.<br />Moore assembles many \\"victims\\" on a boat ride to Guantanamo base, where [amazing footage shows] that 9/11 conspirators do receive better care than those who risked life and limb at the site.<br />That visit couldn't be completed, so they move on to Cuba, where they get what appears to be first-class treatment and attention.<br />The medical people there do not seem to be under pressure from presumptive guys outside of camera range....looking concerned that a certain image won't be conveyed. It's very convincing.<br />Also convincing are trips to England, France, Canada, for more \\"lessons\\" in what should be possible in the greatest country, the United States Of America.<br />With all the sweeping epiphany, which leave a strong impression, no doubt, one still has to ask, is this *positive* propaganda still propraganda, still cutting for effect, which could have been even more effective, had Moore taken literally all the statements made by our elected leaders and clinically (no pun intended, I assure you), dissect them by demonstrating the fallacy of those statements? The viewer still gets the uneasy feeling that there might be some compelling stuff still kickin' around the cutting room floor (along with some stray potato chips): maybe some interviews with Europeans who got that free care, but had to wait too long, or received third-rate care when it was all said and done?<br />I wish that Michael had provided a more point - counter point format, then topped it off with that remarkable boatride segment.<br />Also, I'm not clear what he thinks of our former First Lady. He offers up some very flattering clips of her, then later seems to imply she joined the crop of Healthcare system *political* beneficiaries.<br />Perhaps her mistake was to describe the plan as \\"Universal\\" coverage, something that does not sit well with those who reject \\"Socialistic\\" remedies. Those folks will find disturbing a wine and cheese party of self-estranged Americans carry on about bad stuff back home.<br />The \\"Features\\" section, I guess containing the additional 80 minutes of stuff, has alot more/Moore pro-Socialistic philosophizing, from several individuals, including a Communist Revolutionary's daughter and a retired Socialistic member of Parliament (who's given the time equivalent of a Hal Roach two-reeler). Moore's wide-eyed interviewing technique does not seem to allow for \\"That's okay, but we're talking about *containing* Capitalism as it relates to Health, not replacing Capitalism with Marxism.\\"<br />At the end of the Documentary, Mr. Moore's prescription (pause) for his new managed-by-taxes, non-bureaucracy is not scribbled out. Maybe we need another Documentary provider for that one.it was all said and done?

With an open mind and the desire to help oneself, this  book is of enormous assistance.  It enlightens, examines, provides a  plethora of goals and aims for one trying to find his/her way through a  maze of psychic pain, emotional distress, and/or true depression.  It was recommended to me by a physician who is board certified in  Adult and Child Psychiatry. The book is a gem!  Buy it, borrow it. . .  but, read it again and again.

Listen to \\"Mail from India\\", \\"Sweet Solitude\\" or \\"Spotkanie Z Matka\\" and you want to hear it again and again. Every time you listen to disc 3, you hear new interesting details!  Most recommended CD-Box!! Bravo Vangelis!!
B000006TRV|5.0|Another classic from Pink Floyd. I listened to it in my car three days in a row.
0143038583|3.0|Omnivore's Dilemma is an uneven read. There were times when I really enjoyed this book and felt that I was learning a lot but unfortunately there were other times that I felt like I was wasting my time. The book is divided into 3 main sections: Industrial food production which comes down to corn, pastoral which comes down to grass and the final section is dedicated to hunting and gathering.     There is a lot of educational value in this book but given its length and goals, I think it could have been a lot better. There is not enough hard scientific and historical background. When I read a book like this I expect to learn a good amount of facts and also to read about the author's opinions and biases. This book was too heavy on the latter and not enough educational. There is a time and place for an author to infuse his writing with personal opinions. It would be like reading a book on nuclear energy in which the author constantly reminded us of Hiroshima and Chernobel disasters before educating us on the facts. For example, he clearly believes that giving corn fed cows antibiotics and hormones is harmful to the person who eats beef. Sure, it may sound intuitive that a grass fed cow may be better for you but Pollan cites little or no evidence. I have heard about the evils of corn fed beef for years and I was disappointed that Pollan offered no hard evidence whether it was truly bad or okay for the consumers.    In another part he demonizes industrial food produces by pointing out they are faced with the \\"troublesome biological fact: Try as we might, each of us can only eat about fifteen hundred pound of food a year. Unlike many other products - CDs, say, or shoes - there's a natural limit to how much food we can each consume without exploding.\\"  That is ridiculous! With pretty much any product one could argue that there is a limit to the amount one can consume. Even using his own examples, you can only listen to CDs 24 hours a day so there is a limit to how many you can buy. You can only wear one pair of shoes at any given time so again there is a limit to the number of shoes you can buy. There is a limit to the number of calories one can consume but you can make those calories more expensive by increasing their quality. Why don't industrial food processors all turn into farms like Polyface, where everything is produced right on the farm? He emphasizes the suppliers dictating to the consumers on what they should eat and desire. Could it be possible that consumers demand cheap fast food and industrialists merely give them what they want? In other words, could the production be demand driven? He should have at least entertained some of these questions.     He touches on the amount petroleum needed to produce industrial foods and the effect of farm subsidies on food outcomes. This was great stuff but Pollan does not go deep into it. He talks about some of the hidden costs of industrial food production such as environmental pollution and poor health for the consumers (ie: increased risk of obesity, diabetes, etc.). I applaud him for connecting these elements which may not be obvious to many but I wish he had gone more deep and cited hard scientific studies.    On the more positive side with regard to other issues such as ethics of eating animals, Pollan gives a well balanced and critical presentation of arguments. His writing is engaging. I enjoyed reading about his time on Polyface farm, hunting pigs and gathering mushrooms. At other points he acknowledges the lack of scientific facts with regards to some of his claims which is commendable. For example, he states that he can only presume that foods without atrazine are better for his son's health.
B000UD08HW|4.0|If you're expecting film quality on this 1080p blu ray your going to be dissapointed.  First of all the video was recorded in 1080i and then transfered to the blu ray format.  When you take in to account this is a live show with lighting for a show, not for a tv production, you end up with a lot of noise and blown out video in the spotlight.  Overall though its an amazing show and if you have a good receiver you can take the audio bitstream uncompressed, (sounds great)  I recommend this show for all pink floyd fans, just don't expect to be WOWed by the video quality.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|There were alot of action movies at the theaters this past year and I could argue that Live Free or Die Hard was as good as this movie. The difference between tihs movie and Live Free or Die Hard was the acting. You went to see Die Hard because you knew there would be great action and some funny moments in the film. This movie had alot of good roles and I loved Joan Allen in this film. She was spectular. There is also great action scenes and we finally figure out who Jason Bourne really is. I highly recommend this movie to fans of action films. It was one of the best ive seen all year and probably one of the best in the last ten years.
043957773X|5.0|This was an awesome book and by no means is it goth. It's very detailed and descriptive. Also, the imagery is very awesome. :)
0345413377|1.0|Please read this book before letting your children read it and then you decide whether it is acceptable for children to learn how to summon demons and keep a door open to those in the underworld.  If you can only read the last chapter, it pretty much tells Mr. Pullman's goal in this trilogy.  He wants our impressionable children to know that witchcraftery is good, and that they should also keep their powers a secret from others.  He also states on the last page that Heaven is not a place to live for but that they can finally just live for today (the here and now).  I only rated it one star because I had to, to submit a rating.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|How come no liner notes? This is the second movie that has come this way from Amazon. Is it a cost cutting procedure or are they not included anymore?
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|I'm gonna ask you a guestion, have you ever seen one of those obscure films that supposedly has a deeper meaning? Well this is kinda like one of those, except one problem, it has no meaning at all. In fact, it doesn't even attempt to have a meaning, a reason for it's own existence even. That's just the thing, it's doesn't need too. You see, it has cool CGI, and that's all it needed to keep it's target audience enthralled.    The point of this film, is about \\"mother\\". From the beginning to finale, all that anybody talks about is \\"mother\\". Now you never really understand what the existance of \\"mother\\" has to do with the rest of the plot (which constists of this sickness infecting children), but all in all it does.    Now, the creators of the film expect people to be enthralled in finding out what mother is, what's gonna happen to the characters and such. They expect to achieve this with no backround to the story, no character development, and no sense of pacing at all. The film is so sure of itself, so blatantly arrogant of the powers it believes it posesses, it doesn't even bother to make sure the viewer is interested, or even has some sense of caring for the character at all. It's like watching the second half of a movie.    Now some of you are probably saying, hey man, this was intended for FF fans only. Hear me out, part of the art of making a sequel (or continuation) is giving people who are new to the story a chance to jump into the story by explaining it, and this film does an awful job at it, it doesn't even attempt to care about new audience.    In the end, I have to get down to what I'm trying to say. This movie sucked, not even it's cliche, overdone action sequences could save it. It was a good looking mess. A good looking visual effects extravaganza, but even more so, a huge, steaming, piled up mess. Now the question is, who's gonna clean it up?
B000VPUIA6|5.0|Amazon ships fast! The edition of Help is more than what i expected, well worth it!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|The creative, musical connection was phenomenal. The music was touching & memorable. A truly feel good movie. Absolutely one of my favorites!
B000BRBA8S|4.0|I didn't want this film to end, because (1) I loved the visual style and the actors/actresses in the film, and (2) I had no idea what the heck was going on in the movie.<br /><br />First, the good.  This guy (Kar Wai Wong) is a visionary as a director.  He has a stunning eye, and I was totally in love with the visuals in the movie after the first five minutes.  I did watch the commentary features where they discussed that when the film was debuted at Cannes the special effects were not even completed, but the simple lines attracted Mr. Wong's eye and changes were made to incorporate more of this linear style for the final version of the film.  This is a film to be savored simply for its world construct, both present, past, and future.<br /><br />Secondly, the bad.  The plot was difficult to follow, and it will take multiple viewing to sort some of it out.  I first assumed the movie was set in the year 2046, and Tony Leung as Chow Mo Wan wanted to escape the boring present of that age by going back in time to the late 1960s.  Then I read that, no, the world of 2046 was actually just a science fiction story that the characters may or may not appear in, but definitely female androids/robots did exist (deliciously beautiful, I might add).  People come and go, a murder may or may not have happened, Tony Leung may be Chinese or he may morph into a Japanese character in 2046.  Additionally, the protagonist and/or his love interests tend to stay in hotels in rooms 2046 or 2047.  There's a woman who may be missing a hand, or maybe not, but either brings good luck, cheats, or has terrible luck herself.  Whew!<br /><br />Now, for the ugly.  Well, in a film this sumptuous, there really isn't any ugly at all.  There is a mysterious symbol that appears occasionally, sort of a big flower or fungus with perhaps a hole in the middle that one can peep through (there's a lot of spying going on in the film); maybe that's a bit odd, but not ugly.<br /><br />One last thing: kudos for the music in this film.  I'd love to have the soundtrack, as it wanders from original music to opera to classical to jazz to traditional tunes.  The atmosphere of the film would be diminished significantly without this score.<br /><br />There are several bonus features in the film including interviews with Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi, who plays the daughter of the hotel manager.  Those interviews helped explain the movie to me a bit.  There are also deleted scenes and an alternate ending which don't help clarify anything.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for those who love beautiful movies, and are not put off by the non-linear plot.  I enjoyed it, but for good or ill, it will take multiple viewings to make sense of the plot.music in this film.  I'd love to have the soundtrack, as it wanders from original music to opera to classical to jazz to traditional tunes.  The atmosphere of the film would be diminished significantly without this score.<br /><br />There are several bonus features in the film including interviews with Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi, who plays the daughter of the hotel manager.  Those interviews helped explain the movie to me a bit.  There are also deleted scenes and an alternate ending which don't help clarify anything.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for those who love beautiful movies, and are not put off by the non-linear plot.  I enjoyed it, but for good or ill, it will take multiple viewings to make sense of the plot.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|\\"The Song Remains The Same\\" is an amazing DVD set, a classic. Plus now, you get an extra Bonus disc with rare live footage like the great \\"Celebration Day\\", \\"The Ocean\\", \\"Over The Hills & Far Away\\" (blistering solo!), \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", and other rare, priceless behind-the-scened footage of the legendary Led Zeppelin. Guitarist Jimmy Page was on fire, the slickest he ever played or looked. The guy moves and plays like a demon, there is none cooler. Page is a true star and it couldn't be more obvious than on this DVD. The classic versions, killer vibe, and pure power brings back so many memories...\\"in the days of my youth\\" indeed. I will always have a soft spot for TSRTS. There something special about Page's great tone on TSRTS, it is perfect, he was out to kill for sure. Check out Page's fluid as lightning 12-string solo on the title track \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", then scratch your head at how someone could play this good. Then check his guitar solo on \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", as this version is famously known for what is perhaps the most killer, tastiest improv guitar work ever laid down, live or studio. Doubt me? Listen to it and it is obvious this isn't a normal band. Watch Page coax razor-sharp, soaring, crystal-clear sounds out of his Theremin on \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", you just don't see other bands pulling off cool stuff like this. John Paul Jones's bass lines are incredible, this guy is about the hottest bassist you will ever encounter, I guarantee you, his clarity, groove, spontaneity, fluidness, and speed are unequalled in the rock world, as is John Bonham's legendary drum work. Bonzo's speed, dynamics, creativity, musicality, and power is immense. His cymbal work is also extremely refreshing. And Plant's power and range matches the music like no other vocalist can. But musicians know this. Talk about red-hot improvs!! All the naysayers whining about an edit or two are completely missing the point. Ignore them, they know not what real rock and roll is, trust me.<br /><br />All in all, a must-have for any Zeppelin fan. If you like rock and roll and don't dig at least some of music on \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", you may need a cat scan to check for brain damage, and also recommend an immediate hearing test at your local ear doctor. The live improv jams here are to die for, the seemingly endless barrage of rapid-fire, catchy, classy, tasty riffs and improvs from all the players seem almost inhuman in their intensity and quality. Page keeps coming at you like a machine, and has thrown away more great riffs in an afternoon than most bands base their entire careers on. These guys were the kings of fearless live improvisation, while still being expertly structured as well. They had it all. The sound mix is killer. Put on Bonzo's lightning-fast drum triplets at the end of \\"Rock & Roll\\", crank it, and be prepared to clean you tongue off when it hits the floor. Bonzo is so fiercely fast and powerful it is scary. Same goes for Jimmy Page's violin bow section on a spellbinding version of \\"Dazed And Confused\\", you've never seen a human being chop at an instrument like this. If you like rock and roll or music in general, get this now, it is that good.st me.     All in all, a must-have for any Zeppelin fan.

B000WTNCQS|3.0|Just purchased the so called \\"remastered: version. The cd sound quaility is extreemly week...hollow and empty with no impact. No comment on the dvd. I have a high end system and am sick and tired of these so called remastered cd's. They are all a complete rip off! Save your $$$ and listen to the origionals......
B000MR9D5E|4.0|The quality of these programs are wonderful.  I can't say enough good about them.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Star Trek TOS in HD Is AWESOME...the color, clarity and crispness makes this look like your seeing it all for the first time all over again.    Can't wait for seasons 2 and 3 to come out in HD.  This HD set is worth its price to any avid ST fan. But, this will give anyone who has never seen ST the chance to see what its all about.    You MUST see this.....You will be amazed at what you never saw before.
B000PKG7I4|4.0|Package didn't get to me as fast as others. Packaging was good. No problems. thanks!
B000WTNCQS|4.0|The Joshua Tree Super Deluxe Edition is a powerfull package of 1 CD with remastered Joshua Tree, 1 CD with old b-sides and unreleased song and 1 DVD with Live concert. The Joshua Tree is as expecter, its great as for 20 years ago. The CD with b-sides and unreleased is not great song, but fun to hear. The DVD is a must with the concert from back then. It has a beautiful book which is much like a bible - nice nice. Filled with goodies. Also you find some very nice pictures on carbon. It is all nicely packed in a hardbox that in itself is art.  All in all - a very beautiful U2 art and culture.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This series is definitely worth purchasing.  It takes us through one of the most important set of events in our lifetime and so many of us have no idea what went into the space program and finally landing a man on the moon.    The series is well acted, factual and entertaining.  I think it is a wonderful addition to anyone's movie collection.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|it is one of the best movies for kids and adults that disney has ever made and i am so glad that they brought it out again for all the kids to see again and even their parents. enjoy!!!!!!!
B00063F8B2|5.0|This soundtrack will have everyone in your household singing and dancing. It would even put Scrooge in the holiday spirit. It's a beautiful and fun soundtrack!

B000VBJEEG|5.0|I loved this film from the start to finish. It has great characters, excellent voice acting, a fun plot, and a fluid development. My friend recommended this movie and my husband and I enjoyed it so much we decided to purchase both the DVD and the soundtrack. For me, it is definitely the best animation film I've seen since Spirit Way.    Oh, and I adore Emile~!
B00003CX9W|5.0|I bought this DVD with The Fantasia Anthology. When I watched this disk, I was amazed. The color quality was amazing, the sound was great, The \\" Making of Fantasia\\" segment was excellent. The only problem I had was with the THX optimode sound selection. When I tried it, it set to a default sound, like on a scratchy TV channel, and was compleatley weird. I just decided to watch it in the normal sound. Now, I'm thinking that I should've tried out the video optimode. Anyway: this is a great movie that has been finally put out on DVD. If your a Fantasia fan, this is for you.
0679446230|5.0|This book has been sitting on my shelf as a TBR read for so long that I can't remember where or when I got it. But I'm glad I finally read it.  I enjoyed reading about the traditions and customs as they were (not sugar coated to present a better image).  To me, the story showed strengths and bonds of a people and how it can be broken by outside influences. I also saw a story of a man feeling one way within, yet displaying something else totally different, and fearing that his real feelings may be found out and he would be considered weak.  That's something that can be transposed to any culture. Overall, this is tremendous read that kept me engaged the whole time.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This deconstructs the American health care tragedy effectively. Insurance companies place a 30% private tax on medical care, while pretending at public health. Single payer systems, such as those in Canada, England, France or Germany, are not achieving perfection, but they are not as likely to be randomly cruel to the unlucky.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|There's been a few Kavitz songs that I've heard and loved, so I started with this CD in purchasing his music.  I really enjoy it.  Looking to exploring which CD(s) to buy from here.  Very enjoyable.
B000005EJL|2.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Supertramp's reform really got unnecessary in terms, at last they didn't produced something good and their reasons for reforming gets only in mind with the idea that they got something exciting and new, even that hope of listening to the Supertramp masterpieces as Crime Of The Century slightly got onto my mind. Well, nothing like it; Rick Davies went still in the band, at least, but this record and this \\"Supertramp\\" reform was completely unnecessary; Some Things Never Change is a really misleading effort which hits nothing but a plain commercial (but unsuccessful) jazzy melodies with a terrible, nauceatic funk style. \\"You Win, I Loose\\", which got some radio airplay, and \\"Sooner Or Later\\" are the only very least hits but far plain this is a dissapointing album to skip.
B000YENUI6|4.0|Cronenberg follows up his stray away from horror film A History of Violence with this great film. Vigo is great and will most definitely be nominated for an Oscar. The film appears so simple on the outside but the depth is immeasurable. The mob + everyday families really gives the film a great boost. It is my second favorite film of the year behind No Country For Old Men. But that may change after I see Sweeney Todd tonight.  This is one of Cronenberg's best along with Dead Ringers, Videodrome, Existenz, and A History A Violence. A must see for anyone!
B000001FRY|4.0|This contains the single song that set the precedent for all of U2's other work in the decade: the opening \\"I Will Follow\\" - its ringing riff, spiritual lyrics and huge chorus all forecast everything else the group would end up doing. The only thing not in place is Bono's vocals: he sounds a bit like Tom Verlaine, as he did on all of the other early records, now that I think about it. So that song rules, as do other songs like \\"Twilight\\" (which again has the huge chorus), the creepy \\"An Cat Dubh\\" (in English, please!), with a cool heavy guitar riff and creepy stomping drums and all kinds of neat sound effects.  Then some mold sets in, even amidst crashing rockers like \\"Out of Control\\", \\"The Electric Co.\\", and \\"Stories for Boys\\"; the charged-up disco-rocker \\"A Day Without Me\\"; or the dark, Lord of the Flies-inspired \\"Shadows and Tall Trees\\". Take \\"Into the Heart\\" and \\"The Ocean\\". What's the point of those songs? Oh, wait, there isn't one! HA! Marvel at the wit and wisdom (or lack thereof) of Finu Lanu! And it's safe to say that I don't enjoy \\"Another Time, Another Place\\" either - it sounds like all the good songs, only is kinda... pathetic itself. So this is a bit shaky, a bit derivative, a bit inconsistent, but good enough to warrant a solid 8. A great way to start out!

0805047905|5.0|This was my son's favorite book!  We would read it to him over and over and he still wanted more!  He liked the sing-song rhyming and even wanted to join in after a while!  I would definitely recommend this book to someone with young children!
0439882826|5.0|This is a terrific book. The pop-ups go on and on. Every page has at least 6! The last page opwns and the light sabers actually light up! My husband wanted a copy to keep for himself!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I can't figure out what I liked best -- the premise, the unorthodox twists and turns, the great actors, the flights of fancy...this movie has it all for fantasy buffs.  Michelle Pfeiffer really does chew up the scenery, Robert De Niro and Ricky Gervais have a great set piece dialogue, Claire Danes is literally radiant.    The reason this may appeal to non-fantasy lovers is that it has a kind of matter-of-fact approach to the magical  pieces -- as though magic were like technology for us, just something that people live with, and they use it to achieve their real goals -- happiness, power, money, etc.      The movie just works on a number of levels...romance, comedy, action, coming-of-age story, chase story, quest...as one of the producers says in the \\"making of\\" piece in the special features -- it might not change your life, but it will definitely entertain you for two hours.
B000002LND|5.0|I am not a big fan of pop music, this said, I can still give credit to those who make pop music at a higher level.  Madonna is, without a doubt, one of the best artist of pop music of the 80's, the choice of tracks is perfect and this cd is a must have if you want the best pop music, so many hits, almost incredible.  Ciao !
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Sometimes, you have to be willing to take a chance with perfection.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it is a good motto to live by, but the great artists have all been willing to think outside the box.  George Martin took something we all know and turned it on its head.  We're all better for it.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|As someone who grew up in the 60s listening to Beatle music everyday, I can tell you this CD and the movie it came from, truly capture the essence of that amazing time in history. Every song on this CD is extraordinarily well done and true to the original intent of the song. It's like having the Beatles walk back into your life in a refreshing way that grabs you and your teen age children's hearts. The wonderful thing is that my two teen-aged kids are now huge Beatles fans because of this CD and we all listen to this music together. What a gift this CD and movie are to the world. Makes me enormously grateful and happy every time I listen to it. Blessings, Sue Frederick
B000KCHZK6|3.0|I was disappointed by this CD.  The quality was fine, it's just not up to the Norah Jones standards or interest her other CD's hold for me.  I wish I hadn't purchased it.
B000ION79Y|1.0|This is indisputably one of the biggest TURKEYS ever made.  Horrible!  A lot of Seagal's voice is dubbed in by another actor and is very disruptive and laughable.  Seagal phoned into his performance from the other side of the world. I've already spent too much of my valuable time writing about this complete waste of film.
B000VL9XE2|5.0|It's so frustrating to see this album be rated 3, 2 or even 1 stars, and it's specially bad because I'm sure a lot of people out there decide whether to give something a try based on its average ratings.    I'm sure there's hundreds and hundreds of other morons who can't get over the fact that this album's not constantly as fast/relentless/chaotic and sort of one-dimensional as Calculating Infinity (which I honestly find somewhat redundant), but then again, who cares about them?    I remember putting on Miss Machine, and while I more than enjoyed the intricate fretwork and mindblowingly technical drumming, I always thought to myself that it'd be amazing if they ever delved a bit more into the eerie, groove-oriented sounds ala Phone Home.    This album is a wish come true.  It's a mixture of both the extreme metal urgency expected from the band, and electronic sampling that ranges from dominating to beautifully subtle, often on one same track.  From the start, skinsman Gil Sharone makes sure to clear any possible doubt that he's not up to the task with both Fix Your Face and Lurch, and he continues to prove himself throughout the whole album (other drum stand-outs being Nong Eye Gong, 82588, Party Smasher and Horse Hunter).   Though not all tracks are as traditionally 'brutal', he never stops flaunting his amazing sense of groove and rhythm, which leads most songs; and in this aspect he's much more skilled than Chris Pennie.   It's almost impossible to listen to the entire CD without doing some air drumming at one point or another.    Liam Wilson's bass lines are also more noticeable and relevant this time around.     Kind of a vague review, I know, but i honestly don't have the patience to sit here and write about every single track individually.  However, there's one song I couldn't possibly NOT single out. Sick on Sunday is surprisingly my absolute favorite. It's not good in that traditional epic metal song sense. Nor is it good because it's extremely fast or hasa blistering solo.  Some would say that at 2 mins 10 secs in length, it's not even an actual song. But there's something in the pulsating electronic immediacy of its first half, and the verse and ambience after the first minute manage to send chills down my spine with every single listen.    I don't think I'd ever been so infatuated with an album before.  Oh, and to the one-star reviewers.. you bother me so much I honestly hope bad things happen to you. Really.    The end.
0395631246|4.0|If you have been wondering where to start, to develop skills on negotiations, this is a nice book to read.<br /><br />The authors bring out the merits of the principled negotiations over the traditional hard/soft negotiation techniques. The book recommends to focus on the people, their interests, available options and the standards in any negotiation. I liked the BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement) concept which can be applied to many real life negotiation situations.<br /><br />The content is short & sweet. This book is focussed on principled negotiations and doesn't deal with all the negotiation paradigms. I would consider this as a primer for negotiations. At the end, there are a few techniques suggested to handle people who play dirty tricks.<br /><br />You cannot learn to swim by reading a book. Similarly, you cannot be a negotiation expert overnight by just reading this book. You should perpetually apply the ideas.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|After seeing this as one of Oprah's favorite things, I knew this would be a great gift for my daughter as well as my son. It is something their whole family can enjoy. The series on tv is wonderful. The photography is amazing, so clear and beautiful. I sure would like to know how they got so close to many of the  scenes on the video.The shots of the animals is what amazed me. Both my son,(he's married to a vet and was once a elephant handler) and my daughter also a animal lover will surely enjoy this video. This is something one can watch over and over again, not just sitting on a shelf collecting dust. So I did my major Christmas shopping right here on Amazon. How easy was that!

B000M9BPEY|5.0|Burton's brilliant film Big Fish is a clever and entertaining.  More importantly, it manages to invoke real emotions as the audience connects with the multi-dimensional and true portrayals of the characters on screen.
1932907009|5.0|Don't mess around. Buy this book. Don't pay attention to Blake's (few) detractors! This book is an essential part of your screenwriting arsenal.  It is a useful resource for both novice and advanced writers because it is concise and accessible. My copy is dog-eared, marked-up and coffee-stained.  I've read it so many times that I can roll it up and put it in my jacket pocket.<br /><br />Blake combines humor, experience and a focus on pragmatic techniques that will help you achieve your dreams of writing (and maybe selling) a commercial screenplay. For those who eschew the notion of writing a Hollywood screenplay in favor of an \\"indie\\" script, rest assured that this book will come in handy. Not only will it help you internalize narrative structure, but also it will help you know how to break the rules. Of course, the Save the Cat technique won't work on every film you've seen but it works for most.<br /><br />Pay particular attention to the BLAKE SNYDER BEAT SHEET.  As a person who naturally struggles with structure, it helped me uncover holes in my screenplay's structure, figure out how to pace my second act, and became a template for structuring my pitches. He provides a framework in which you can plan out your screenplays and execute in a way that takes the anxiety out of the mix.<br /><br />Did I mention Blake is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet?  His 15 beat workshop was a superb experience where a dozen of us pitched ideas, worked out our titles and loglines, and came up with 15 beats in two days.  After taking his class, I fully internalized structure to such an extent that I can now analyze the problems in my own screenplay concepts, and my friends' too.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|PLANET TERROR    A jolly gore fest. Great sex scene with peg leg. Good female Cast. Fun but average.    DEATH PROOF    Who wants to see a talentless botoxed lipped, pot bellied, saggy arsed, pigeon toed, rhythmless actor do a 5 cent lap dance?     Unsympathetic female cast. Nice Car Crash. Boring as Hell. Terrible dialogue. Cop-out ending. Some nice editing.     Question: When will Tarantino take movie making seriously again and produce something of worth?
0151013837|5.0|Enjoyed Life of Pi without the images.  In fact one of my top 5 reads of all time.  The paintings add an interesting element to the story.  It doesn't necessarily add to the book, but definitely does not take away from it.

B000RIWAYY|5.0|In a word, awesome. Joe Satriani is the man, and this was the best instrumental guitar music CD ever. Releasing this in modern quality just reinforces that fact.<br /><br />The DVD has a live performance that is also great. Stu Hamm plays bass for the show, and does a 5 minute bass solo that totally rips.
B000UR9TQE|3.0|As most long time Zeppelin fans, I was extremely eager to get my hands on the remsatered SRTS.  After the fantastic jobs that Jimmy Page and his crew did with the Zeppelin DVD, and How the West Was One, I was ready for something sonically exceptional.    The results were mixed.  The concert sound is clearly improved on the remastered SRTS. But despite the decent performances, the Zeppelin energy that was so present on the early shows in the DVD and on How the West Was One are clearly lacking.  I guess studio magic can only do so much! And it highlights how good Zep could be when they were on!  The additional footage, although fantastic to watch, really highlights that's Plant's voice was in trouble. Compare the versions of The Ocean and Over the Hills and Far away between the SRTS New York show and the earlier HTWWW LA show!     Nontheless, the Song Remains the Same, is the Song Remains the Same - it hasn't changed since I first watched it at as teenager at a late night theatre back in the late 70's.  It's not perfect, but it sure sounds a lot nicer! And is a heck of a lot of fun to watch.    I have a bigger beef with the remastered soundtrack however! The same edits/cuts prevelent in the film (some annoying ones all over the place - No Quarter, Dazed and Confused, Whole Lotta Love), were thankfully, never part of the original soundtrack.  In No Quarter, during the key board solo, there is a delightful break after Bonzo enteres on drums, where Page plays a nice background riff for a minute before his solo.  It's gone on the new soundtrack!  Equal issue before the thermin section of Whole Lotta Love.  I don't know why the Soundtrack couldn't have remained as a better record of the shows.  It didn't need to match the movie 100%.  I prefer the old Soundtrack, even though it omits Black Dog, Over the Hills, etc.      I had a similar beef with the BBC session. Little 3 to 5 second bits of songs were edited out - still sounded nice - but for us bootleg collectors, we knewthose BBC recordings like the back of our hands!  It was a shame to seem the needlessley altered.    In closing, if you don't have a copy of the SRTS, go out and get it.  If your're die hard Zep, you have to get it anyway.  My suggestion though, don't get the Soundtrack!  Stick with the original!

B000TLTUL0|5.0|\\"Sweeney Todd,\\" the long gestating film project that translates Stephen Sondheim's landmark musical to the screen, casts a spell you won't easily shake.  Director Tim Burton, one of the masters of cinematic imagery and exploring the dark, wounded and twisted spirits of all manners of outsiders and monsters, ups his already considerable game to craft one of finest films of the year, a musical that transcends creaky song and dance routines to become a force of nature.  From the moment Johnny Depp hits the screen with a sallow, pale complexion and black holes where eyes should be, \\"Todd\\" boldly and mesmerizingly explores the destructively poisonous forces of jealousy, perversion, rage and revenge, all set to an astonishing backdrop of a surreal, horrific London.  It's hard to imagine anyone this year outdoing what cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and production designer Dante Ferritti have accomplished here.  Their nightmarish creations give this tale a perfect context of nightmarish gloom and doom, making it impossible to peel away, even when the blood flows and the characters plunge into a heart of darkness sculpted by vengeful ones.    Depp, for whom it seems no part is too farfetched and whose best actor oscar is long overdue, plays the titular barber of fleet street, a man whose perfect life was stolen from him by a sexually perverted and self-righteous magistrate named Turpin (the ever slimy Alan Rickman) and his even more demented right hand man (the rodent-like Timothy Spall, who uses his unique features to conjure up a man of maniacal, gleeful evil).  Thrown into jail for fifteen years, Todd returns bent on revenge and upon arriving at his old home on fleet street, he meets an old pie-making friend coined Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter, a gothic beauty and actress of the highest order).  Mrs. Lovett surrenders herself to Todd's maelstrom of revenge, giving just about anything to win the love of the man whom she has quietly loved for years and Carter radiatesunrequited longing and macabre wit, especially during the musical number \\"By the Sea,\\" the sunniest song of this blood-drunk madhouse.     But Todd no longer has the capacity for love.  With the Judge determined to marry the daughter (a luminous Jayne Wisener) Todd lost when she was only an infant, whatever humanity was left in this broken man was obliterated, leaving only a soulless angel of vengeance that seeks to carry out retribution on the entire population of London, from the random schlub who wanders into his shop to a two-faced barbary rival (Sacha Baron Cohen, an absolute riot).  Depp's black eyes stare at his old razors as if they were cherished friends, now allies in the quest to slake Todd's appetite for the perceived guilty and their blood.  It's to the credit of Burton and the producers that the film never once cops out for a cheap feel good moment or shortchange the bleakness of the story but let it flesh out organically to make you feel it when the scenes designed for maximum thematic impact deliver their best punches.  It helps that the cast could simply not be better or that the music could not have been better translated to the screen or that the plot clicks, even the young love story between a sailor who had traveled with Todd (Jamie Campbell Bower) and the barber's daughter.  The copious amounts of blood may be off-putting for some, but by all means do not miss this one of a kind film.  It's a masterwork.

Some graphic, disturbing violence of animals being cut open, but necessary for the plot and in keeping with old world beliefs in witchcraft.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|Stay is an excellet movie. as other reviews say, do not mistake this movie for a horror film. It is a movie that is a complete \\"mind freak\\" and will have you questioning what is real and what is not. Although the beginning may seem a little slow, it is defenatley worthwhile. By the time the movie is over you will be quentioning what has happened. all though this moive may not be appleaing to some people, it is still a great movie raising questions beyond its ending. I fully reccomend this moive to anyone.
B00005JPTI|3.0|This is the third remake of Richard Matheson's \\"I Am Legend\\"  The first half of the movie is visually stunning, and Will Smith does a magnificent job of portraying a man alone surrounded by evil, slowly coming unglued.  The second half degenerates into smaltz.  The whole point of Matheson's story is that the title is a play on words.  In our time, adults have frightened their children, and themselves, with stories of goulies, ghosties, and things that go bump in the night.  Probably the most terrifying of these is the vampire, an almost perfect amalgam of sex, blood-lust, and death.  In Matheson's reversal, there is only one human left in a world of vampires, and the human spends the daylight hours hunting and killing the sleeping vampires.  He himself has become the thing of legend; the monster that rules the day instead of the night and the terrifying creature the vampires use to frighten THEIR children.  I still think the best rendition was the first one, a black and white film called \\"The Last Man on Earth\\", with Vincent Price.  You can actually get it and 49 other movies in the 50 Horror classics movie pack on amazon for about $16.  I won't even mention the Omega Man with Charlton Heston, except to say \\"BLeech!!\\"

0060775858|5.0|My cousin sent me this book when my first child was born.  She said she gave it to everybody she knew when they had their first baby.  I now do the same, and you will too.  If there were a genre called \\"lullaby books\\" this book would define it.  \\"Goodnight Moon\\" begins with a wonderful picture of a room filled with comforting, familiar objects, including a grandma bunny rabbit knitting in a rocking chair and pictures on the wall depicting scenes from nursery rhymes.  The book's words, in poem-form, say Goodnight to the objects in the room one-by-one as you turn the pages.  But the fun lies in finding the little mouse that appears in the accompanying pictures of the room.  You will find yourself, with your child, pretending not to see where the mouse is.  \\"Where is he?  Do you see him?\\"  Then a delighted \\"There he is!\\"  Yes, all's right with the world.  You found the mouse, again.  Time to turn off the lights.  Time to sleep.

B00005JPLW|4.0|Actually, 4 and a-half.    The unique style of shooting laid a surreal cast to the (mostly and amazingly) accurate representation from historical events... ok, ok, no hoplite soldier ever went into battle dressed like that.  The relationships were cartoon-ish but heightened the brutal nature of the world they lived in: and it IS based on a tertiary source, Miller's graphic novel \\"300\\", not primary source material after all.  Leonidus' last night with his wife was restrained but was able to make it a bit warm under the collar; the \\"R\\" was for violence. Mainly, though, it was a faithful adaptation of Frank Miller, and that can never be bad.

B000TLTUL0|4.0|It's been nearly thirty years since a Stephen Sondheim musical has been translated from Broadway to the big screen (the last time was 1978's dismal [[ASIN:B00003CWT3 A Little Night Music]] starring Elizabeth Taylor), and judging from the previews of this dark 2007 musical, the producers don't seem very anxious to publicize the fact that most of this film is sung in verse. That's too bad because it's really Sondheim's evocative and powerfully haunting music that drives and ironically humanizes the chilling storyline. It also helps to have director Tim Burton's visionary talent guiding this audacious venture since the horrific and heartrending subject matter ideally suits his idiosyncratic filmmaking style. I was fortunate enough to see the original [[ASIN:B0009941IE 1979 Broadway production]] with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury, and screenwriter John Logan does an admirable job of streamlining the original musical to the core story of Sweeney's relentless vengeance.<br /><br />Sondheim-loving purists may balk at the fact that certain characters are gone in the screen version, as well as several songs with some of the remaining score switched around from one character's voice to another to serve distinctly different purposes in the story. It's also true that Burton does not hold back on what is an uncompromising gore-fest, but luckily, he doesn't dwell on the barber's bloody acts. Instead, he fixates on establishing the moody, nearly colorless atmosphere of nineteenth-century London and how the key characters become entrenched in the pervasive grayness of an urban purgatory from which no one can escape. All the production values on display are top-notch with stellar work from cinematographer Dariusz Wolski (all three [[ASIN:B00005JM5E Pirates of the Caribbean]] films), production designer Dante Ferretti ([[ASIN:B00005JKN9 Gangs of New York]]) and costume designer Colleen Atwood ([[ASIN:B000EHRVMY Memoirs of a Geisha]]). The technical virtues of this production are undeniable even if it does become somewhat wearing to experience the constant dankness.<br /><br />Burton did not venture far in casting the leads with his frequent leading man Johnny Depp in the title role and the director's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter as the smitten Mrs. Lovett. Both make their roles work within the contours of their recognizable screen personas. Depp lends his almost feline-like brand of menace to a role more often played by more robust, operatic-style actor-singers a decade or so older, while Carter eschews Lansbury's comically buffoonish performance for a more sinewy, cynical approach. Their singing may lack range and nuance, prerequisites for mastering Sondheim's complex lyrics, but they perform with vigor and certainly within character. Alan Rickman is his usual villainous self as Judge Turpin, whose act of jealousy provides the impetus for the blood-soaked plot; and in genuine callow fashion, Jamie Campbell Bower plays the aptly named sailor, Anthony Hope, the devoted suitor of Johanna, Sweeney's long-lost daughter now Turpin's ward. Orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick, the soundtrack does not suffer for the marginality of the star voices, as he brings the full potency and epic grandeur of Sondheim's music to the fore.<br /><br />Several of the musical numbers are quite effective. There is \\"Pirelli's Miracle Elixir\\", which introduces Sweeney's preening competitor, Adolfo Pirelli (a nice bravura turn by Borat himself, Sacha Baron Cohen), at a medicine sideshow accompanied by a gin-loving orphan named Toby (affectingly played by Ed Sanders), who becomes intractably involved with Sweeney's and Mrs. Lovett's affairs. Bower sings the ballad, \\"Johanna\\", with proper yearning as the purity of his intentions is contrasted sharply with Sweeney's murderous deeds. Depp gets his moment in the sun with \\"Epiphany\\", in which he spells out the inevitably tragic fate of London under his switchblade, and he duets with a tentative Rickman on the haunting \\"Pretty Women\\". My favorite ballad from the show, \\"Not While I'm Around\\", has been turned into a lullaby Mrs. Lovett sings to Toby, and while Carter sings with conviction, she is actually at her best on the lighter numbers like the self-effacing \\"The Worst Pies in London\\", the deceptively coy \\"A Little Priest\\", and the sunny \\"By the Sea\\", which cues the film's only splash of life-affirming color. But above all else, this film is a triumph of Sondheim's musical genius and Burton's craftsmanship.ballad from the show, \\"Not While I'm Around\\", has been turned into a lullaby Mrs. Lovett sings to Toby, and while Carter sings with conviction, she is actually at her best on the lighter numbers like the self-effacing \\"The Worst Pies in London\\", the deceptively coy \\"A Little Priest\\", and the sunny \\"By the Sea\\", which cues the film's only splash of life-affirming color.

0525950079|2.0|I have not read Pillars of the Earth, so I was not sure what to expect. Unfortunately, I soon discovered that this novel is trash. These are my main gripes:    1. Follett seems unable to distinguish between love and sex. In the novel, virtually the only way that characters express their love for each other is through sex. When a major character loses his wife to the plague, his immediate thoughts are how nice her breasts were. When a character is missing the woman he has loved all of his life, his memories are not centred on making her laugh, having long conversations, etc, but feeling her up. It reads like it was written by a thirteen year old boy who has not matured enough to fathom that men and women can actually love each other with more than just lust.    2. All of the women in the novel always want sex. No matter whom they are or what the situation, they are always ready to go. Even when a woman is raped, she enjoys it. Again, I suspect a thirteen year old author.    3. The most infuriating point - Follett feels the need to explain everything. Even when a character's actions and words make their motivation obvious, the author spells it all out for us, just in case we missed it. This dumbing down happens on every single page. It feels as though the target audience was chimpanzees who have just been taught to read. I think my IQ dropped around 20 points by reading this novel.    4. Everyone is beautiful, or at least the women are (unless it serves the plot otherwise).    5. The characters are all entirely one-dimensional. The good guys are always good, the evil characters always evil. Hard working people are always hard working, kind people are always kind. And that's it. No-one has any subtle (or even unsubtle) nuances to their personalities. It's all black and white. Every character could be described in a few words and for them, that's it.    6. There is no character development. The novel spans a thousand pages and over four decades, but the characters all remain the same. No-one learns or grows or develops.    7. The one thousand word plot is not really a plot, just a contrived series of events. A real plot has cause and effect. WWE has just one event after another, interspersed with contrived and convenient coincidences. Many of these events could be rearranged and it would make little difference to the outcome.    8. The book begins with an ominous secret which promises to underlie everything that happens. By the time we reach the end, it turns out that this great mysterious secret is timid and almost irrelevant, playing almost no role in the story.    I did endure with WWE to its long-winded end, so I can't give it one star - that is reserved for books that get thrown across the room, such as anything by Matthew Reilly.

B00005R8GU|5.0|While a college student back in the winter of 1972 I attended an Urban Studies semester program in Chicago. One night I went with some of the other students to see Muddy Waters at a club called (if my memory is correct) Alice's Revisted. I did not know anything about Muddy Waters and little about the Blues. Muddy put on an incredible show that was one of the musical highlights of my life. I still get shivers down my spine thinking about the night. I particularly remember when he sang \\"Got my Mojo Working,\\" and I was up on my feet chanting and dancing with the rest of the audience. At one point, a small fire started in some curtains on the stage and the Muddy the rest of the band calmly kept performing as it was quickly extinguished, perhaps preventing a panic situation. Later in the semester someone bought \\"Fathers and Sons,\\" and after hearing the album I went out an bought it myself. For years I would periodically listen to that album and be transported back to that magical Chicago evening. With the switch from vinyl (and my turntable being broken by my two year old son in 1989), Fathers and Sons and the rest of my LP's went into retirement, but I never forgot Muddy Waters and the rest of the incredible musicians on the album. Recently something inspired me to search for it on Amazon and I purchased the CD. I am delighted to discover that everything on Fathers and Sons is as wonderful as I remembered. If you like the Blues, I strongly urge you to buy this CD now. It will make you life at least a little bit richer!
0307155102|5.0|This book was a favorite of my children, and I have given it as a gift to two new mothers, who have told me it was their child's favorite, too. My 18 month-old granddaughter is getting it for Christmas this year. I don't think you can miss with this one.
B00005Q34G|4.0|This album format does justice to some very classic music. In the era of MP3's and down graded music fidelity, it is refreshing to see a format going the other way.  The ONLY format where MP3's sound fine is in headphones.  In anyplace else (like your house, your car, ...even your kitchen) the sound is tinny and without depth.      The fidelity of the hybrid SACD is great however the selection of tracks could use some expanding.  I would have liked to have more of the Avalon or Stranded albums on it.  Overall you will like the disc, plus the low end is great, especially with a subwoofer.

0765318741|4.0|A plague has wiped out humanity and left vampiric creatures in its wake.  Robert Neville, a former factory worker, is the sole surviving human being as far as he knows.  He spends each night barricaded in his home with vampires outside his door calling for him to come out.  During the day, he fortifies his home, kills vampires, and even researches the cause of the plague.  Neville is obsessed with explaining what has happened in rational, scientific terms and discovers a bacteria that appears to be the root of the problem.  His struggles to stay alive and find a purpose for his life form the crux of the story.<br /><br />I Am Legend has been cited as influential by virtually every horror writer, but you should not expect to find a classic horror story here.  The first third actually conforms pretty closely to the norm with some harrowing moments, but then the book focuses much more on Neville's research, his attempt to befriend a dog, his state of mind, etc.  The ending is more of an ironic social satire than it is a climax to the story.  None of this is to suggest that the novel is not worth reading, it certainly is.  Just don't pick it up expecting a thrill ride of scares because you'll be severely disappointed.<br /><br />For those who have seen the movie [[ASIN:B00005JPTI I Am Legend]], with Will Smith, you should know that there are more differences than similarities.  Whether you loved the film or hated it, reading the book is a very different proposition and it should be evaluated on its own merits.  It should also be noted that the two previous attempts to adapt this story [[ASIN:B000P0J0BU The Omega Man]] and [[ASIN:B000WC3A0I The Last Man on Earth]] also took significant liberties with the story.<br /><br />I Am Legend is a classic and likely to remain so for some time.  The basic concept of the last human in a world of vampires is too chilling and evocative to ignore.  I enjoyed it, but would not recommend it to those looking for a hard-core horror novel.  This story is part character study, part social commentary, and, yes, part horror.  Go into it with an open mind and you will probably enjoy it.racter study, part social commentary, and, yes, part horror.  Go into it with an open mind and you will probably enjoy it.

0451197879|2.0|Barton George Dawes has sunk deep roots.  He's worked at the same commercial laundry plant for 20 years, and lived in the same house for nearly as long.  But the city has plans to extend a highway that will force the destruction of both places.  Dawes has apparently been losing his grip on sanity for the past three years when his young son died of brain cancer.  George buys a high-powered rifle as well as a .44 magnum handgun.  He manipulates things at work so that the company ends up with nowhere to relocate to when the plant is demolished and gets fired.  He starts thinking about buying explosives to destroy the highway and the equipment used to build it.  I'm not going to give away any more of the plot, but when a story begins with a man purchasing guns while having two separate voices holding an argument in his head, you might guess that it doesn't end with him sipping Mai Tais on the patio of a beachfront condo in Florida.      Roadwork may be narrated in the third person, but the perspective is solely from Dawes.  Readers must endure his rambling rants about virtually every aspect of life and soliloquies covering all manner of topics.  If Dawes were eloquent or funny, this might be entertaining.  But he's a confused, lonely, hurt man who doesn't understand why he is doing what he's doing and offers no real insight on anything.  The only thing you learn from Dawes is that he's angry, and it didn't take 300 pages for that point to hit home.  It's surprising that Stephen King, the master of creating compelling characters has managed to write a novel built around a single character that is neither likeable nor interesting.      Alienation from modern society is felt by many of us to varying degrees, and a book showing these feelings taken to the extreme has the potential to entertain and enlighten. Unfortunately, Roadwork has missed the mark badly on both counts.  My suspicion is that this might have made a great novella of 100 pages or so but there are too many scenes of Dawes yelling at people and then saying \\"I don't know\\" when they ask him what's wrong or what he wants to do.  There's no sense of tension building as his march to the inevitable occurs, just one more day of confusion and despair in what feels like an endless series of them.      Roadwork has a few strong moments such as the last ten pages.  But this is not a book that could remotely be described as a page-turner or compelling.  King wrote some great novels at this point in his career, but he missed the mark with this one.  I wouldn't recommend it to most readers.  King fans will do better to look at almost any of his other books before trying this one.  Perhaps people who loved the movie [[ASIN:0790742780 Falling Down]] will find something worthwhile here, since it has similar themes and might entertain similar audiences.
1401384854|5.0|The audio CD version of this wonderfully detailed nonfiction book is superlative -- largely because of the rich narration by actor Edward Hermann.   In Halberstam's last book, the history of the Korean War is described through the lens of the politicians, generals, line officers, soldiers and civilians.  The narrative captures the ego of MacArthur, the miscalculations of the Americans, Russians and Koreans, and the arrogance of an American miltary machine that had rusted by 1950.

It will most likely be nominated for Best Picture and for Best Actor.  Viggo Mortensen does a great job in this movie... a great job.  If it was not for Daniel-Day Lewis in There Will be Blood and sympathy for Johnny Depp, Viggo would take the Oscar.  This is his finest performance.  The entire cast is wonderful!  This movie is even better than A History of Violence... which was another great movie.  All in all, i think if you like Cronenberg's movies, if you liked A History of Violence, good acting, good thriller gangster movies you will love this movie!  This movie is one of the best of 2007 and surely the Oscars will let us know very soon!  A must see!
1878424505|4.0|The message contained in THE FOUR AGREEMENTS by Don Miguel Ruiz is exceptional. The delivery of that message is less than stellar. English may well be a second language for Ruiz. At least that is what is indicated in his writing style. I have no fault in that, but the book lacks editing. I don't mean mistakes. In that regard, I found no errors. I'm talking about sentence structure and word usage.<br /><br />The message delivery often goes in circles and the text often reads choppy. I found myself reading the sentences in an almost staccato fashion. There is also a complete lack of conversational tone to the text. You'll never find \\"don't\\" or \\"we're\\" but will find an annoying amount of \\"do not\\" and \\"we are\\".<br /><br />As I stated already, the message itself is fantastic, though the almost zen-like feel to it may turn some off. The message is so powerful, and could be life-altering for many, that I would have liked to have given five stars, but the text structure simply wouldn't allow it.<br /><br />The 138 rather small pages make this an easy afternoon read and the paperback copy has nice cover flaps and is of very good quality.

You can view each of these versions with or without the commentary, as well as view the deleted scenes by themselves.  The Special Edition also lets you toggle the Special Edition markers that display on screen when you are viewing deleted material.    Disc 2 has a whole bunch of production material, including a fairly long \\"making-of\\" featurette featuring interviews with a lot of the people involved in the film.  It also includes pictures, additional footage, and the original script.    The extras really allow you to learn the history of the making of this film, and all of the struggles they went through to complete it.

B000WC3864|5.0|Three stars because it is the infinite greed, money grabbing version release of The Evil Dead.  The Evil Dead I give ten stars hands down. I give ten stars for Joe Loduca's music score. \\"Yeah I know\\", the 100th Evil dead DVD edition. I agree with most of the Evil Dead fans, I'm tired of it. The only bright things about this umpteenth edition: I like having the Widescreen and Standard format each on a single disc. The third DVD is all I believe unseen extras on The Evil Dead creators and actors and actresses. Annoyed with Sam Raimi and Anchor Bays greed to cash in on an already done project is aggravating to me. I will admit, the extras on all three DVDs is excellent stuff, I have never seen before, is really interesting and again caught my interest in this gore masterpiece for the infinite time. I admit I seen this new version in the store and on impulse had to get it, after watching the extras I'm glad I did. If you have the the other Evil Dead releases, you won't need this latest one. The extras though, are not only great for an Evil Dead fan, but any fan of this genre of film should have. Check out the photos I have put up, this will give you a better idea of the packaging of this umpteenth release of this fabled film. Anchor Bay has done an incredible job with this release, packaging is phenomenal. One thing that gets most overlooked with this film is Joe Loduca's amazing music score. Evil Dead would never be as good without Loduca's incredible music score. Evil Dead continues to fascinate its fans and of course newer generations of fans.

First, it depicts the nearly unbelievable paranoia and suspicion surrounding the lives of Soviet East Berliners before The Wall came down. Second, it recounts a powerful dramatic conflict in which friends and lovers are challenged to resist blackmail and other forms of brutal intimidation in order to survive.  And third, it treats these very serious themes with an understated humor that makes you laugh out loud.  It's a brilliant film not to be missed.  I saw it twice, once in a movie theater and once on an airplane coming home from Berlin.  The second viewing was even better than the first.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|An early Christmas gift for my 15 year old daughter, this set has quickly become a family favorite.  Already, we have marathon-viewed through the first two Gilmore seasons, and the entire DVD set seems to be of excellent quality.  I recommend this highly if there are Gilmore Girl fans at your house.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I'm not really sure why this film didn't do better at the box office. A stellar cast (pardon the pun), two cute leads, a vicious Michelle Pfieffer in a plum role, wonderful special effects all should add up to gangbusters in the theaters. But alas, it came and it went quietly away, perhaps a gem to be discovered a few years down the road.<br /><br />Stardust, based on a story by fantasy guru Neil Gaiman, is the story of lowly Tristan, a shop store clerk who's smitten with a local beauty, who's playing her cards closely to choose the correct beau. Tristen hopes to woo her one evening by snatching up the remnants of a fallen star they witnessed one evening. Determined to cross \\"The Wall\\" Tristan finds himself out of his own world, and into a magical world filled with people quite like us and quite unlike us, all the same.<br /><br />The star, played by the always amazing and incredibly underused Claire Danes, must avoid being captured by several villains and learn to trust the faithful Tristan to guide her to safety. Claire is luminous in her role, both beautiful and surprising as a star with a ton of wisdom about Earth, but still trying to find her footing on the planet. Charlie Cox takes Tristan on his own unique journey, beautifully encompassing his gradual change from nerd to warrior with aplomb (save a terrible error in the middle of the film in which he grows long locks to change his appearance, ugh!).<br /><br />Robert De Niro must also be mentioned as Captain Shakespeare, a sky pirate with a hidden secret that adds levity to the weighty plot. And dear sweet Michelle, fresh off her turn as villainous Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray, gives her witch a delightfully nasty turn as a saggy beauty fighting to retain her lost lustre of youth. You go Michelle!<br /><br />Really, this is an adult fairy tale, a mix of Princess Bride and Starman, with delightful surprises here and there, and a nice ending. Stardust should have done better at the box office. My only hope, at this point, is that a legion of fans discovers this charming film and finally propel it to the heavens as it should be.fans discovers this charming film and finally propel it to the heavens as it should be.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|Hairspray is the ultimate musical! The cast is amazing especially Michelle Pfeiffer, Amanda Bynes, and James Mardsen (his voice is amazing, who knew!) This film is just as good as other classic musicals, the songs and dance numbers are absolutely brilliant, I couldn't take my eyes off the t.v. screen. My favorite song is Miss Baltimore Crabs. This is a great family film, I highly recommend it! Also buy the cd as well. Enjoy!

Directed by the great Akira Kurosawa, it is a 3 Hour and 26 minute movie that feels like a 2 hour movie.  Kurosawa (who also co-wrote the movie with Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni) gives the movie a pace that is never rushed, but never drags.  The pace is natural, giving the viewer a chance to get to know all of the main characters very well.  Character development is just one of the high points of Seven Samurai.  Each of the 8 or 9 main characters is well rounded.  We learn quite a bit about some of them, and the information always comes at the right time.  Their personal stories are all interesting, and the characters come across as real people with real lives - even if those lives would have occurred long ago.<br /><br />The plot is deceptively simple.  Kurosawa had a knack for using simple plots that he fleshed out which character development and interesting turns of events, and it always made for a fantastically focused story.<br /><br />Here, we have a farm village that has been ravaged by bandits in a time of civil strife and civil/feudal wars in Japan.  One of the farmers overhears a group of bandits as they come across the village.  As they remember raiding the village not long before, they know that there won't be much to take now, but later when the barley is harvested there will be plenty to take.  The villagers, desperate for a way to stop the bandits, decide to hire Samurai to defend them, but with no money to pay them, all they can offer the prospective Samurai is food an lodging.<br /><br />The way in which Kurosawa plays out this simple plot is a joy to watch.  Every single aspect of Seven Samurai works.  The film is simply flawless.  The script, the direction, the photography, the acting (Toshiro Mifune is, as he almost always was, brilliant, but the rest of the cast, led by Takashi Shimura as the lead Samurai is excellent as well), the sets - it is all perfect.<br /><br />Another aspect of this movie that makes it even more noteworthy are the action sequences.  Seven Samurai is a drama.  It is a plot driven and character driven drama, but the great character and plot moments lead up to several action sequences.  Some long, some short.  All of them are amazing to watch - especially considering that this movie was filmed in 1954!  Watch carefully and you'll see some of the first (if not THE first) uses of slow motion in action sequences.<br /><br />Kurosawa's greatest achievement with the film could arguably be the fact that Seven Samurai does an incredible job of capturing the way that period in time in Japan must have looked and sounded.  The viewer really is taken into a world long since gone.<br /><br />Seven Samurai not only holds up well under repeated viewings, but it actually gets better.  This is an amazing film that every serious film fan should see.<br /><br />And own.<br /><br />The Criterion 2006 3 Disc re-release of Seven Samurai is nearly as brilliant as the film itself.  The film has been cleaned up quite a bit, and the new transfer is excellent.  Along with the two discs of the film itself is a 3rd disc of supplemental, \\"Bonus,\\" feaures, including multiple documentaries and interviews.  Actually, there are more supplemental features on discs one and two as well (including two separate audio commentaries, and another installment of Toho Masterworks' \\"Akira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful to Create,\\" series).<br /><br />While Seven Samurai is arguably one of the ten best films of all time, an argument could even be made that it is THE greatest film of all time.  Whether or not it wins that argument is up to you, but it is clearly a great, great film and a testament to the talent and genius of Akira Kurosawa as a filmmaker.<br /><br />Buy this DVD set now (if you don't already own it).

B000SNUMC0|2.0|I eagerly anticipated this release from Iced Earth.  My preferred vocalist, Matt Barlow, isn't in the band anymore, but I had hoped for some enjoyable riffs, if nothing else.  Unfortunately, Framing Armageddon lacks most elements that made past Iced Earth releases worthwhile.  On the whole, the album fails to convey its intended story, while it provides no memorable tracks due to cluttered, drawn out arrangements.    Unsurprisingly, Framing Armageddon is another concept album from Iced Earth.  Whereas other Iced Earth concept albums hammer the story home, I still can't understand Framing Armageddon's overall concept, even after a few listens.  I would look up the story online, but the music should narrate effectively.  That telling the story, the very goal of the album, fails, suggests the myriad of wrong on this disc.  The inept story might be fine if quality songs filled the album, but individual tracks fail as well.      A weird track comprised mostly of drum beats begins the album.  The beats are not like any other track, and the song isn't metal.  There are several such tracks which aren't exactly songs.  They add nothing musically or to the narrative; they waste the listener's time.    In the musical content, no guitar works stands out on Framing Armageddon.  I enjoy the chugging, heavy sound of most Iced Earth.  Conversely, the tone here isn't compelling.  Of the 19 songs on Framing Armageddon, I can't remember even one riff.  Other Iced Earth albums, or *any* good albums for that matter, have riffs that stick.  You can rock out to their songs in the library with no music playing.  Framing Armageddon doesn't have that permanence.    It seems that the band tries to create memorable choruses through vocals.  In many occasions, several vocal layers compound Ripper's voice.  In the past, Iced Earth has succeeded with operatic singing, chanting, and the like; however, Framing Armageddon's added vocals detract from the guitar riffs.  And, since the riffs aren't good to begin with, there isn't much positive.    In fact, vocals generally don't work on this album.  Tim Owens delivers the high-pitched metal scream several times.  Each time he does it, it affects me less.  It's not a word, and it's not emotional.  There are some female vocals on one track, and they don't fit in either.  Lyrics are neither well-written nor memorable.  They talk about things which may exist; I honestly couldn't tell you.    Clearly, Schaeffer changed his musical approach for Framing Armageddon.  For instance, \\"Infiltrate and Assimilate\\" begins with a progressive-sounding riff.  The riff isn't horrible, but it doesn't sound like Iced Earth.  When bands try new things, they can achieve great results.  On the contrary, the keyboards, sound effects, and extra musical elements of Framing Armageddon cannot hide poor riffs.  This album's wanking unsuccessfully mimics European progressive metal, a style which Iced Earth has never played.  In short, Iced Earth lacks the necessary talent and creativity for progressive metal.    It got the points that it did for a few measures of rocking out.  \\"Framing Armageddon\\" has a good opening riff.  The box art is nice.  I appreciate the distribution of SPV making this available at my local books and music store.  Those positive elements notwithstanding, I can't stand listening to the album any more.  I don't plan to pull it out anytime soon.    All in all, this album does not compare to other Iced Earth releases, and, it isn't a good metal album in its own right.  Framing Armageddon does nothing to be remembered, and there are few fun moments.  I listen to Iced Earth albums to rock, and this album doesn't.  Don't buy it.    ORIGINALLY WRITTEN FOR METAL-ARCHIVES
B00004Y6NW|4.0|I first bought \\"Dire Straits\\" when it came out in 1978 and immediately loved it.  I bought the CD version of the album just a couple of months ago.  The CD, which was remastered, was great.  Mark Knopfler's guitar playing was always fantastic.  But you can certainly pick up a lot more of the subtlety of his playing from the CD than you could from the old albums!  At $10.99 this was a bargain for a great classic album/CD.
B000OY8NII|4.0|A very charming series. I'm not passionately in love with it the way I am with Firefly, but it's still thoroughly enjoyable. Yes, it's a cross of The X-Files with Northern Exposure, but in a good way. Lousy packaging though - it was already falling apart when I first opened it up.
B00005JPFH|5.0|The video/audio quality was great,I enjoyed the movie very much,and liked the bonus features on disc#2,except that there were \\"NO\\" \\"DELETED SCENES\\",and there must have been \\"PLENTY\\" of them!Also,no exclusive world premiere footage with the cast,either!All in all,if you are a \\"Spider-Man\\"/Comic Book Fan,you will enjoy this 2-DISC DVD!
B000UR9TQE|4.0|After owning the original Song Remains the same CD, VHS tape, and DVD, I can say the couple added tracks are worth losing pieces of a few others. Sound quality is very good. This is one instance where Dolby Digital outshines its DTS counterpart. Video is okay, after all it was shot in the 70's, and the audio as I mentioned above is very good. Not mind shattering like some of the other recordings I own, but nice.     A great addition for the Zep-maniacs' collections!
B000VNMMRA|5.0|I thought the video/audio quality was a  five star,packaging was good,and the bonus features on disc two are enough to satisfy any Bruce Willis/'Die Hard'fan,an all-around 5 stars!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I loved Room For Squares.  The next album, not so much.  But this album is fantastic.  I can't get enough of it.  Mayer is more soulful, and the lyrics are thoughful.  This is an album that shows how the artist has matured both musically and as a person.  I've already bought another copy for a friend.
0316067598|2.0|The book was billed as a tale of survival, but the first few chapters are more concerned with the author's political opinions.  40 pages into the book and the main characters are still sitting on the plane to Afghanistan.

B000X9PNOG|1.0|The only thing I wanted to hear on here was the Bat Out Of Hell album songs which are not well done at all on this set.  I'm astonished that reviews claim this to be Meat Loaf at his best when it clearly is far from it to anyone without talent deafness.  If you watch the BOH/BOH II tours and even the welcome to the neighbour tours meat is anything but on top of his game here.  His voice shines in very few places on bats live and is mostly terrible.  Not a good live performance.

B000X1Z0BU|4.0|I really enjoyed \\"Once\\" as it reminded me of [[ASIN:B000Z8HI5C Time and Tide]] - another great independent film.  The original music is very memorable and moving, and the film's slice-of-life feel helps create believable 3-dimensional characters.  Yet again a low-budget film proves to be more enjoyable than almost every other big Hollywood production this year.

B000RZGFYS|5.0|Slayer have always been over the top, no denying it, though there's a lot more bands that are worse in the area of violence and offensive material. This is just as true to the sheer speed of the music and vocals. Honestly, there isn't much to say on the album itself that has not been said before. It's fast, wild, violent and possibly a little over-hyped and yet is still one of the best metal albums ever made. So here's just a few small things to say about this album:<br /><br />1.) The first song, \\"Angel of Death,\\" is considered one of Slayer's best songs ever. It's also one of the most controversial. The lyrics graphically depict the hideous, sadistic scientific experiments done by Nazis during the Holocaust. The controversy lies in the fact that people, who don't understand the background behind Slayer, think they're evil, Satanic and are promoting the very music they make. They claim to, however, not take either side, saying that they wrote a song about what happened in history because it happened. It doesn't endorse it, but it isn't exactly against it either.<br /><br />2.) In regards to the above, Slayer is also Aetheist, something most people tend to not realize. They are NOT Satanists who actually believe in the music they write. In fact, most of the music they write isn't even Satanic. They may describe Hell, death and war, but only one true Satanic song was on this album: \\"Altar of Sacrifice.\\" The song \\"Jesus Saves\\" isn't exactly about Satanism, but it is about the hypocricy within Christianity and \\"Raining Blood\\" could be anything, though it's lyrics do seem do describe a Satan-like figure rising to power.<br /><br />3.) This whole album is indeed an essential to any metalhead's collection, overhyped or not. This is especially true of you Master of Puppets fans out there. My friend, who'd never even heard of Slayer, came over and I played this for him. He only ever listened to Metallica and Megadeth and was shocked when he said that every song sounded like something off of Master, just with a bit of a darker feel.<br /><br />4.) To those who are wondering, yes, it often does sound the same and is so fast it may actually seem like it's just one 30 minute long song.<br /><br />Final Word: Despite all the possible overhype (you decide whether or not it is) this CD is excellent and an absolute must for any true metalhead. Keep headbanging and long live Slayer!<br /><br />** 5 Stars out of 5 **something off of Master, just with a bit of a darker feel.<br /><br />4.)

B00004VVNB|5.0|I bought this movie because I really enjoyed it years ago.  Still enjoyed the movie.
B000NA2BEU|3.0|I don't think there'd be many out there who'd think this was anywhere near as good as the first two seasons. If you're a fan, you'll want to see out the series - and it really isn't bad. Kristen Bell is still brilliant. If anyone was to blame for this season being flat, it was the director's and the casting agents, who might have come from the Young and the Restless for all their inspiration. It all just makes you love Veronica all the more, and Bell for her efforts.
B000R8YC3G|5.0|One of the funniest films of the past few years, Shaun of the Dead manages to skewer and lovingly address the zombie genre made popular by George Romero and other horror directors. The entire cast is great, especially the two main characters played by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.<br /><br />The HD presentation of the film on this disc is just as good as, if not better than the disc for Hot Fuzz. The surround is very active, with the zombies growls coming from every direction during key scenes. Like Hot Fuzz, this film is pretty much an aural and visual assault on the senses. The extras are the same ones you can find on the regular DVD release but they're entertaining at the least. I'd recommend this disc whole heartedly to comedy fans and horror fans alike.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|Although critics have been almost unanimous in their praise of this film, many fans of the show are quite harsh in their appraisal, chiefly for two reasons - one, that the principals are not great singers, and two, the deletion of roughly 50% of the score.  I surprised myself in that, having purchased the soundtrack and seen the movie, I am in neither camp, as either of these factors might heretofore have caused me to pronounce most film adaptations of almost any Broadway musical a failure.  Instead, I am thrilled far beyond my expectations with this production.<br /><br />It might not have been so, had I not had so much respect for Stephen Sondheim.  As part of the pre-release publicity, he has granted an unusual (for him) number of interviews, and says that he is unequivocally satisfied with Tim Burton's vision.  As anyone who appreciates his high level of artistic integrity will agree, Mr. Sondheim would not give praise to this project if he were not satisfied with it.  At 77, Stephen Sondheim is considered by many to be the greatest composer in the history of the American theatre, and I have followed him long enough to know that no amount of financial consideration could cause him to declare his endorsement if he were not truly happy with the finished film.<br /><br />I have listened carefully to what Mr. Sondheim has had to say in those recent interviews, and now understand why so many stage musicals previously transferred to celluloid haven't worked.  To begin with, time passes very differently in a theatre than it does on film.  That which takes several minutes in a Broadway theatre (i.e. a full-blown production number) is apt to seem like a small eternity on screen.  Therefore, the very thing that keeps most audiences clamoring for more in live theatre is apt to make many movie audiences run screaming from the auditorium.  Then there is the problem of what Alfred Hitchcock once termed \\"suspension of disbelief\\"; that is, in real life, no one ever bursts into song during one of life's dramatic moments, no less accompanied by a full orchestra, and many moviegoers who are accustomed to a certain amount of reality therefore find musical films particularly hard to take.  Thanks to some of the theories on musical film voiced by Mr. Sondheim in the past week or so, I finally understand why so many previous attempts to film Broadway musicals fall flat - in short, the theatre and film are two entirely different mediums, with two entirely different audiences.  Although many theatre lovers, myself included, would be happy to sit through an entire musical transferred to screen exactly as produced on stage, most movie audiences demand something different.  And something different is what they surely get with Sweeney Todd.<br /><br />Then there is the score.  Tim Burton has said that he has been a fan of Sweeney Todd since its original run.  I believe that, as disappointing as it is for many fans to accept how much of the score has been cut, it was probably even more agonizing for Mr. Burton to decide what pieces to remove.  The original ran over three hours, and at least 75% of the story was sung, making Sweeney Todd one of the few genuine operas to ever come out of Broadway.  The film runs only 117 minutes and, judging by the length of the soundtrack CD (a mere 72 minutes) easily 40% of the score has been removed, chiefly the ensemble pieces.  Mr. Burton apparently judged (probably correctly) that the choral numbers which worked so well on stage, although containing some of the wittiest lyrics, would be clunky and ponderous on film, and he made the prudent (if, I'm sure, difficult) decision to let them go.  This is likely to be the sorest point for many fans of the show.  And had I not been paying careful attention to Mr. Sondheim's recent interviews, I may not have been able to get past that point myself.<br /><br />But what has been excised is more than compensated for in Mr. Burton's sumptuous visuals and careful attention to detail.  Although Mr. Sondheim has made changes to the lyrics, resolving previously problematic portions of the score and actually improving it, it's amazing how much of what is left of the score is faithful to the original.  Though it's a tragic story, Sweeney Todd remains in essence a dark comedy, and many of Mr. Burton's finer touches, especially the staging of the musical numbers, have enhanced the story to the point where I have hardly missed the deletions, and I speak as someone who has loved this piece in almost all of its previous renderings.<br /><br />And I admit that, although he has never been a particular favorite of mine, Johnny Depp is a revelation.  Without detracting from previous interpreters of the role (especially Len Cariou and George Hearn), Mr. Depp's evocation of the character is so fully fleshed out, and so filled with genuine pathos and sympathy, that I was able to immediately excuse the fact that he is not a seasoned vocalist.  Besides, to reiterate a point made earlier, this is not Broadway, and there is no need for his voice to reach the back of the house.  If anything, the fact that the principal characters are not great singers actually enhances the realistic feel of the film.  It is also a pleasure to have both Toby and Anthony (not to mention Joanna) played by actors of the appropriate age, and hear accents that actually invoke pre-Victorian London.<br /><br />In the end however, the real star (to me, anyway) is the superlative score by Stephen Sondheim.  I am not amazed that some feel that there are no \\"memorable songs\\" in the score.  Good music should be subtle; the absence of \\"catchy tunes\\" that one will whistle on the way out of the theatre is only indicative to me of the high quality of the score.  Anyone who is previously unfamiliar with Sweeney Todd who doesn't \\"get it\\" is urged to purchase the soundtrack (the full version, with the complete libretto included) and follow along with the words and music as the songs are sung.  The first thing you will realize is (as with any of Mr. Sondheim's works, whether they be in a film, the theatre, or any other medium) how incredibly witty and sophisticated his lyrics are; on first listen you are apt to miss most of his delicious wit.  His use of the English language, his clever rhymes, and above all, his intelligent, deft semantics will amaze anyone who cares to take the time to listen.  There are reasons why so many consider Sondheim the foremost composer of the theatre, and so many intelligent theatergoers hang on his every word.  But just as important as his words (and I have always admired Sondheim's ability to use words above all else that I treasure in the world of musical theatre), you will find, especially if you listen long and hard enough, that his delicate, subtle music will, in time, work its way into your heart and conscience as some of the most beautiful music ever composed.  This is NOT top-forty pop music, the type that is so often mistaken for excellence in theatre these days.  In his ballads especially, Sondheim writes genuine, heartfelt gorgeous melodies; that is, real music.  Once you open your heart and mind to Sondheim's glorious words and sumptuous airs, you may just become a fan for life.ough Mr. Sondheim has made changes to the lyrics, resolving previously problematic portions of the score and actually improving it, it's amazing how much of what is left of the score is faithful to the original.

It also helps to be not just a fan of Fellini, but a fan of the more sprawling and obtuse Fellini films, because this is the pinnacle of that style.<br /><br />Personally I prefer the more intimate and less populous La Strada, but there was no doubt Fellini was a master of sprawling madness, and this one is nearly his best in that style.

I previously heard the author speak and, never having read any of his books, immediately went out and purchased \\"Atonement.\\"  I have always enjoyed novels set in the 1930s-1940s dealing with the themes so prevalent in that time--desperation, tragedy, triumph, passion, and the indefatigueable spirit of the human heart exemplified by that generation.  World War II provides the canvas for a range of emotion the author explores in rich, engrossing detail.  Now that I have seen the movie I want to read the novel all over again.
0440238609|3.0|The first book is wonderful and gripping.  The second book feels like filler: just a bridge between acts.  The third book is OK as a wrap-up, but it feels exactly like one.    SPOILER ALERT      Fankly, I can't see what the religious furor is about.  In particular, in the third book makes it very clear that the God being fought is not a/the creator.  There are even examples of complex skill sets being imparted by \\"grace\\" of an undefined higher power.  This is not an indictment of religion as much as it is of the inevitable corruption of churches.    And it's pretty spot on on that one.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Purchase your copy of Mary Poppins before it goes in the Disney vault!  This is a beautiful classic that young children will watch over and over again.  When my youngest was in the hospital years ago, I used to sing him the songs from the movie as his IVs were being put in and it was the only thing that would soothe him.  Highly recommend it for boys and girls 2 years old and up.
B000ICM5IK|4.0|Overall, this is a good collection of songs and themes from the Rocky films. My one criticism is that there a bit too many (approximately three) rehash versions of Bill Conti's \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" (the original Rocky theme song) on the tape. There are other music themes from the Rocky films that could have been included in their place....
0060595183|5.0|Written in in wonderfully evocative narrative prose, this book is one of the best first person perspectives on what its like to be under the influence of psychedelics. Going beyond a mere description, Huxley proves himself once again to be one of the greatest american writers as he draws conclusions on the nature of Zen, buddhist mindfulness and the origins of heaven and hell.  Open this book to any page and read some random paragraph and you will immediately have your mind blown clean off your current perspective of reality.
B00005JPTI|5.0|When a novel is written, the reader is free to explore their creative side by picturing an unraveling plot in their heads.  In other words, some novels are very hard to re-create into motion pictures because their story lines are so unworldly and so creative that cinema may ruin our mental images of what it should be.  However, despite movies almost never living up to the book, Richard Matheson must be proud of this rendition.  Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a scientist living in New York as a survivor of a deadly virus that killed off most of the world and made vampires of the rest of them.  By day, he hunts the streets of the city, which has been overtaken by wild animals and he searches stores and homes with his dog, Sam, for any food and entertainment to move him along through the day.  By night, his house is protected with any and every means of security you can think of in order to keep away the vampires that lurk in the shadows.<br />Ultimately, Neville's goal is to find the cure for this deadly disease in order to save the human race.<br /><br />As many of the previous reviewers have stated, the first half of the film gives the impression that this could be one of the all-time greats.  The phenomenal re-creation of New York City was more than enough to capture the viewer's attention and fill their blood with intrigue.  It's the type of experience in the movies where each time you watch the scenes in Times Square, you notice something different.  For instance, the gas prices (God help us) are over $6 a gallon, or the billboard of the long awaited Superman vs. Batman film that never got off the ground.<br /><br />The latter half of the film demonstrates how predictably clich&eacute; hero stories have become in cinema.  However, I can only praise the work Will Smith does in this movie.  His acting was so good that I left the theater convinced that he is in a league of his own among Hollywood talent.  His emotions are so believable that it literally saves what may be portrayed as completely ridiculous scenes in the movie.  As some of the reviews stated, there were episodes where Smith's loneliness and frustration was overtaking him with such force that you could feel tears burning in the back of your eyes.  His acting was absolutely sensational, to say the least.<br />This movie was the story of one man, and there is no man that could do it like Will Smith.  I couldn't think of another actor that can stand alone and excel the way Will did in this movie.<br />It saves very mediocre directing and a somewhat slumping plot line as the film evolves.  However, this IS a five star film.  It's a well played out drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the use of silence only adds to the heart-stopping suspense.  I'd recommend it to anyone interested in action or drama, and it's a must for any fan of Will Smith.<br /><br />Grade: A-etely ridiculous scenes in the movie.

This has become another attempt by a long line of entertainers who think we want to hear their political opinions.  I could overlook a song or two but when 10 of the 20 songs are political protests, I slowly lose interest in the vocals and harmonies while feeling suffocated by the unending drumbeat of political opposition.  I feel like I am at a Democratic rally.

0226264211|4.0|This book is the first I had ever read by the late great economist Milton Friedman.  I had first heard about him in an article by Ben Buranke I had to read for my economics class that had to do with monetary factors and the Great Depression.  I had little idea that as I read more of what he wrote that he would have such a great impact on my way of thinking.  It would be a stretch for me to see he changed my way of thinking.  I have always been for free markets.  However, I had always thought of capitalism as simply a means toward material prosperity while it was democratic political institutions and certain rights such as freedom of speech and of the press that were the sole means of measuring how free a society was.    In this book, Friedman explains that while democracy and civil rights are necessary for a free society, they aren't sufficient.  This is especially true for the democracy part.  He explains using many examples how capitalism is the best means available for achieving both material prosperity and human freedom.      The most striking example from this book is the hollywood blacklist case.  Here were people that were discriminated against by the government because they were communists yet it was the economic system they seeked to destroy that allowed them to find work and continue to live free.  Communists also were able to publish their works since the publisher only cared about making profit.  He then asks how someone favoring capitalism could have published their views given the state is dominant over every aspect of life in a communist country.  The book has some flaws but these are corrected in his more mature work Free to Choose.

B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Sometimes I wonder just how much thought critics put into how hard it is to create the films they so gleefully shred in their reviews. Hundreds of actors, artists, technicians, and workers slave away for years to produce something in the mind's eye of one crazed director who channels it through one or two exhausted actors, and what comes out of the effort is more than a film, it is years of their life they will never get back, spend willingly to give you ENTERTAINMENT, or perhaps even, (dare we say it?) ART.<br /><br />Not that it isn't hard to tell the difference between the two sometimes. When a movie makes you want to stand-up and cheer is it entertainment? When a film makes you want to cry is it art? Then you have movies like this one, where maybe you feel a little like doing both. I guess that just makes it a good and worthy movie, perhaps even great.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett, one of the great actors of our time, so much more than a movie star, as she crafts her roles with a genius that you completely believe her in the characters she plays. Of course I knew her name long before the first Elizabeth came out (thanks to my sister Codemaster Talon), and could appreciate her enormous talent. It did appear that she would always be great and never be famous because of the sort of roles she always chose to play (period pieces and such), but like the amazing Gerard Butler, or the controversial Russel Crowe, sometimes history, if Hollywoodized a bit, can make for a rather entertaining film that might even be thought by some to be art, and that sort of thing often makes the lead actor famous...and the movie an EPIC.<br /><br />Again, an Epic is a hard movie to make, particularly if the studios aren't throwing money around like snowballs Christmas day. I never saw the first Elizabeth (call that irony), but I heard great things. So naturally when I saw the trailer for this movie during the particularly dry season of interesting-looking movies, I wanted to see what it was all about. Actually, the real reason I wanted to see it was that it had so many great actors working together on the same historical epic (and I love epics!). Clive Owen (I first loved him in the BMW commercials known as \\"The Hire\\", and I still think he was great in King Arthur) as a charming historical pirate (errr...PRIVATEER), Geoffry Rush as the wizened old advisor, (the always wonderful Samantha Morton as the imprisoned rival Mary) and or course Cate Blanchett as the impossibly strong, noble, proud, GREATEST ruler England has ever known. If that isn't enough to grab your attention anymore I don't know what is.<br /><br />From the previews, one might think this movie solely about Enlgand's fight against the Spanish Armada, and indeed that is the climax of the movie. But there is much that comes before. This movie actually features three major plot points/story arcs. Firstly, there is the drama that is Mary Queen of Scotts, wherein said rival, of course believing that SHE is the rightful Queen of England, plots and schemes to bring down Elizabeth whilst still in captivity. It's great stuff. Like so MANY people in this movie, the hardship of the times, heavy superstition, the harshness of life, has led to a kind of fanatical insanity. Mary is convinced that Elizabeth is a devil, and herself a saint. God is on her side, should she fail she will be taken to heaven forthwith. There's something almost noble about someone with that particular brand of insanity, believing in themself and the rightness of their desires no matter WHAT. When she dies (as history dictates she must), it is one of the greatest death scenes I have ever seen. Brilliantly directed too.<br /><br />The Queen the handmaiden and the Pirate<br /><br />The second story arc is about sometime pirate/explorer Walter Raleigh, and his relationship with the Queen and her Lady-in-Waiting dear friend. I gotta say, it's really great to see Clive Owen playing a character who isn't a total downer. Granted, he can play serious characters brilliantly, but sometimes kinda feel sorry for him, like maybe he's really terminally depressed and just playing himself onscreen. At any rate, this character is a charmer, and I absolutely love the way Owen plays him. This love triangle is about something hard to describe, but easy to feel if you are familiar. Owen loves the Queen with all his heart, but he knows from the get-go that anything ROMANTIC would only cheapen and weaken her as a person. So he is VERY honored and privileged to love her from a distance, emotionally if not physically. He expresses openly his dedication and affection for her, but naturally, being only human, she wishes it was something more romantic and less idealistic, in her heart, since she knows deep down such a thing can never be. When a romance develops between the Queen's lady and her knight, she is understandably furious, because to her it symbolizes something that she knew she could never have, snatched away forever by one she thought her dearest friend. The poor Queen failed to realize (the way that I see it), that it was actually just another way for the man to become closer to her by making part of her his own. The best scenes from this segment of the movie are Raleigh's repeatedly asking to be sent away to start a colony, and repeatedly being forced to stay by the Queen who simply will not let him go. The best scene in my opinion is the one where she gives him a high position which attaches him to her permanently, and the look on his face when he receives it, a bit like she just ran him through with a sword. Deep down the Queen must know that for a man like it making him stay home is like shooting his horse or burning his ship before his eyes, but naturally a person with such great power can't imagine how making her happy could possibly not make everyone happy (the quick exchanges between Raleigh and Elizabeth during moments of friction are brilliant).<br /><br />The Spanish Armada<br /><br />Okay, so from the trailers what you REALLY wanted to see was a huge battle sequence at the end with the whole Spanish Armada and the English fleet clashing in an epic climax. Well, in that case... you may be let down. The whole thing felt more than a bit anti-climactic, and was oven way too quickly. Ended almost as quickly as it actually started, despite all the build-up. I was really hoping for more, maybe some actual historical detail in the days that it took for the battle for control of the world to be decided. But all in all, it's not enough to kill the movie by any means.<br /><br />If you love history, love Cate Blanchett and find politics and England fascinating subjects you're sure to find this a fun movie. Definitely a rental at least. Maybe more if you're a hard-core fan of any of the above.imes kinda feel sorry for him, like maybe he's really terminally depressed and just playing himself onscreen.

B0010Z32OA|5.0|I loved this movie!  I went into the theater with very low expectations and several free passes.  I came out with my boyfriend and our sons a fan. We walked out the theater planning to buy it. This was such a magical and funny move. I was disapointed that more people did not see it.  None of my friends have seen it, so I had no one to talk to about it.  I am so excited that it is FINALLY on video.  Michelle Pfiefer is great as the witch, Sienna Miller (I think she is over-rated) makes a short apperance in the movie, which becomes the catalyst Tristan's journey. I have never been a fan of Claire Danes, but she was wonderful as Yvaine, and I really liked the guy that played Tristan. Oh yeah, Robert DeNiro, I don't really like him in comedies    (except Midnight Run), but when my boyfriend and I talk about this movie, we always qoute one of his lines.  I figured out the ending about halfway through, but even that doesn't spoil the experience, it's so about the journey.  Enjoy this movie and let me now what YOU think.
B00000DRA9|5.0|Great cd, nice to know in this day and age there is a way us Generation X-ers can find stuff that reminds us of our childhood, the things we grew up with.  This CD was one of them.

B000EULJLU|5.0|The trouble with coming to a new Tool album is that they are not sequels.  In the movies, when the producers, directors, etc. create a sequel, they walk a tightrope between trying to recreate the experience of the original while also offering something new.  The same thing goes when a band attempts to make a sequel to a successful cd, recreating the experience of the original for the audience.  Tool, as I stated, avoids making their successive albums sequels of the preceding outings.  We as fans, however, being used to the industry placating us with watered down sequels of successful albums, come to each new Tool cd, as we come to 10,000 days, expecting to have our wonderful experience of the previous albums recreated.  On some level, this is probably the explanation for a general observation of mine, that Tool fans generally seem to think that the first Tool album they got hooked on is the best album and that it is the pinnacle of Tool's work.  When we go on from that first love, even to already existing works, we come to them with those expectations, as though they were sequels, and if we allow this to bait us into impatience then we only skim the surface of the music.  As is generally acknowledged, Tool is too deep for this, and only passing by we miss the true beauty of the music.<br />With that said, I love 10,000 days.  Aenima was my first love, and to me 10,000 days has a tonal feel about it that is resonant of that album.  I think you can really feel that on The Pot.  The bass and guitar work there really brings me back, but then at the same time the song goes to a totally different place than anything on Aenima.  Somehow, Lateralus never caught on for me, but this album I very much enjoy.  I feel like it has a stronger character than Lateralus.  Obviously, I don't have much particularly intelligent or insightful to add, as I really don't know much about music, but I thought maybe my general insight on Tool's artistic output would be helpful to you.  I hope so.
0393327655|4.0|This book is about the dangers of religion and \\"faith\\" in the modern world. It does a bangup job of pointing out glaring problems not just with religious fundamentalism, but with religious beliefs of all persuasions and degrees. It might be difficult to get a religious person to read this all the way through, but they should. It raises questions that every religious person should be forced to reckon with. And if their \\"faith\\" can't survive close examination, well then it seems to me that it ain't really all they make it out to be, eh?<br /><br />If I were to start up another book group, this would be the first one to read.<br /><br />Some gems from the book thusfar:<br /><br />\\"To be ruled by ideas for which you have no evidence (and which therefore cannot be justified in conversation with other human beings) is generally a sign that something is seriously wrong with your mind. Clearly, there is sanity in numbers.\\"<br /><br />\\"Should Muslims really be free to believe that the Creator of the universe is concerned about hemlines?\\"<br /><br />\\"Religious moderates are, in large part, responsible for the religious conflict in our world, because their beliefs provide the context in which scriptural literalism and religious violence can never be adequately opposed.\\"<br /><br />\\"There is, of course, much that is wise and consoling and beautiful in our religious books. But words of wisdom and consolation and beauty abound in the pages of Shakespeare, Virgil, and Homer as well, and no one ever murdered strangers by the thousands because of the inspiration he found there. The belief that certain books were written by God (who, for reasons difficult to fathom, made Shakespeare a far better writer than himself) leaves us powerless to address the most potent source of human conflict, past and present.\\"
075640407X|5.0|I haven't felt this way about a NEW book in a long long time.<br /><br />Probably not since I discovered George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire.  And even that, I think, didn't make me...simply happy...the way this book did.<br /><br />Patrick Rothfuss's The Name of The Wind is his first book, and it's the first book in a trilogy. Unfortunately it's the only book of the three that's out. Fortunately, I hear that he's actually written the whole trilogy--they're just releasing them one a year. Book two is scheduled for release April 1 of next year--a long time to wait, but not George-Martin-long.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind is, simply put, brilliant. The bulk of the story lies within the framework of another story--which is something that usually bothers me, but the author handles it well and the structure enhances the story--both stories actually. I won't go into the details at all as I don't like even vague spoilers. They spoil the experience. Heck, I don't even like trailers for movies--not even the good ones. I'd much prefer to go into something cold and unprepared.<br /><br />But for those of you who love to be able to disappear into another entirely believable but somewhat magical world--this book is what you've been looking for. It is superb.<br /><br />In many ways, it's the novel that I've been trying to write--even the content bears some resemblance to my many story bits. But I begrudge him not even a little. This book is why I love reading.
B00005JPLW|1.0|Perhaps I am out of sync with the others who enjoyed this movie; but I found it very boring and tedious, and was glad when it finally ended. I didn't care for the artifical CG sky, and some of the monstrosities were so repulsive that I couldn't stand looking at them. The sad part if it all is that Gerard Butler is an excellent actor and his bellowing and ranting in this movie does not do his talent justice at all.  All in all I felt like I was watching a comic strip on film. I just didn't enjoy it at all.
B000PY52EU|2.0|Well, I love both of the lead actors, and quite enjoyed having the camera walk over Christina Ricci's luscious half-naked body throughout, and the sex scenes she did were pretty hot.  But as a whole, this film just kept getting more and more ridiculous and implausible as it goes along.<br /><br />I'm a huge blues fan myself, always have been.  But this film feels like an outrageous parody of the blues and the culture it comes from.  About the first 1/3 of the film was somewhat palatable, then it just kept getting worse and worse, with some of the cheesiest dialogue and situations I've seen in a long time.  All the more painful because there's zero irony anywhere to be found.  The script and director seem to come from some kind of adolescent romanticism blended with hokey New Age therapy.  Even Samuel L. Jackson's considerable talents as an actor can't save this one.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is Christina Ricci's hotness...

078322611X|5.0|I'd like to embellish first before reviewing \\"Field of Dreams\\".  A few years back when life wasn't as easy as I would like it to be  I harkened back in my mind the times spent with my Dad as a youngster seeing the Phillies at old Veterans Stadium.  Now my Dad soured on the game viewing the game rife with greedy owners and overpriced prima donna players and refused to go to the games anymore.  I didn't press my Dad on the issue but at this particular moment I really wanted to go the game with him.  I badgered him incessantly and finally he relented.  I has visions of sugar plums dancing in my head with me and Dad sharing a Kodak moment sipping beers and munching dogs and watching the Phils triumph.  It didn't necessary happen that way and the Phils lost to the old Montreal Expos but that's OK.  The thing about \\"Field of Dreams\\" it views baseball as the great equalizer.  The disgraced Joe Jackson shares the same field as Walter Johnson as well as \\"Moonlight Graham\\", a player whose distinction was that he only took the field for one-half inning and never played major league ball again.  On my cubicle at work Jimmy Rollins and Ryan Howard live beside the greatest Phillie of them all, Richie Ashburn.  If you thought Mike Schmidt was the greatest Phillie of them all you're not from Philadelphia.  This film could have been as corny as the fields that Ray Kinsella mowed to make way for his magical vision.  This film, though, intrinsically understands the greatness of our American pastime and there's always room for sentiment in baseball.

0596101996|4.0|This refers to the 5th edition.    Ten years ago, JavaScript support was so different among various web browsers, I gave up trying to do any logical processing in JavaScript, and went into server-side programming.    Today, you still have to do a select few things two or three times in JavaScript  to get them to work in all web browsers.  But with much better standardization across browsers -- including broad support for Ajax, or remote scripting -- it's become worthwhile again to spend time on JavaScript development.     So, I took an online JavaScript class at the local community college.  I bought this book as my reading text.    This \\"bible\\" of JavaScript skimps at times on simple examples, but provides several lengthy general-purpose code samples that show how to abstract out the client-specific or case-specific handling from an underlying set of routines.      Only the first part of this book is instructional.  Then, there is the wonderful second half of the book, which is all reference.

B000YENUI6|5.0|David Cronenberg's \\"Eastern Promises\\" continues the collaboration begun with actor Viggo Mortensen in \\"A History of Violence\\". As with their previous collaboration, Mortensen plays  conflicted character Nikolai a member of the Russian mob who crosses paths with a British midwife named Anna (an excellent Naomi Watts) who is much more than the \\"driver\\" for Russian mob leader Seymon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) he pretends to be.<br /><br />The provocative and moving story has some nice twists and turns in the screenplay by Steven Knight (\\"Amazing Grace\\")but the film truly comes alive due to the strong performances of Mortensen, Watts, Mueller-Stahl and Victor Cassel as Seymon's son Kirill. Featuring a dazzling, brutal and shocking fight sequence set in a steambath (something that Hitchcock in his prime might have tried), Cronenberg creates a fascinating tapestry to hang his often stunning visuals on. He continues to mature and become richer as a film director with the passage of time. A few folks complained about the resolution of the film but I actually felt that the way Cronenberg handled the conclusion was the opposite of a Hollywood ending and worked extremely well.<br /><br />Although a bit skimpy on bonus features, both the HD-DVD combo and regular DVD edition do have solid featurettes on the making of the film. The HD-DVD side of this combo flipper looks marvelous while the regular DVD side (which mirrors the single sided DVD in terms of its look)looks extremely good as well. The first \\"Secrets and Stories\\" focuses on how Cronenberg brought his unique sensibility to the material and \\"Marked for Life\\" focuses on the tattoos that play such a key role in the film. Both combined run under 20 minutes and it is very disappointing that Cronenberg did not supply a commentary track (I suspect when Oscar comes calling we will see a \\"Special Edition\\").<br /><br />\\"Eastern Promises\\" features rich and often stunning performances with Mortensen deftly handling his Russian accent and Watts tackling her British one with equal skill. \\"Eastern Promises\\" makes for a fascinating bookend with \\"No Country For Old Men\\" which has a very different story at its core but also focuses on unique characters deftly integrating them into a compelling plot.<br /><br />\\"Eastern Promises\\" might not be for everyone but the stunning performances, deft direction and well written script certainly deserve recognition when it comes to awards time. High recommended.d Watts tackling her British one with equal skill. \\"Eastern Promises\\" makes for a fascinating bookend with \\"No Country For Old Men\\" which has a very different story at its core but also focuses on unique characters deftly integrating them into a compelling plot.<br /><br />\\"Eastern Promises\\" might not be for everyone but the stunning performances, deft direction and well written script certainly deserve recognition when it comes to awards time.

B00005JPTI|4.0|I Am Legend is effective as a thriller through the first three quarters of the film, but unfortunately it is unable to keep up the momentum through the ending, leaving most avid movie fans disappointed and unsatisfied. The film tells the story of Robert Neville, a military scientist who apparently is the only survivor of a terrible virus, first billed as the cure for cancer, which instead has either killed or mutated the human population of earth. Neville spends his days collecting food and searching for a cure with Sam his beloved dog, and his nights surviving the mutant onslaught.          Will Smith holds the film together with his fantastic performance as Neville. He effectively portrays the mental breakdown of a man who has not seen another human in three years. Neville fights his mental demons just as much as the physical demons. Neville is consumed by his desire to \\"fix\\" the situation and find a cure, and Smith accurately depicts his panic in trying to do so, as well as his attempt to keep himself sane through setting up mannequins at his local movie store and talking to his dog.         Coupled with Smith's performance is the breathtaking cinematography. The sweeping shots of a deserted NYC are stunning, as well as the panicked flashbacks into the evacuation process when the \\"cure\\" becomes deadly. Just watching the shots of New York's empty landmarks is enough to make I Am Legend worthwhile. Unfortunately, though, the CGI mutants leave something to be desired, and really aren't that terrifying. The monsters on the city streets look like the animation from Alvin and the Chipmunks (okay, maybe not that bad).        Similarly, the script holds the film together nicely, providing scares as well as humor. However, the writers slackened off in the end, diverting from focusing on Neville's sanity, an approach which had worked so well up to that point, to focusing on simply the plot, with a poor Hollywood-cliche ending.         Overall, though, Smith's performance and the stunning cinematography make I Am Legend worth a look, for all movie fans.

B00005JKCH|5.0|I like it -[[ASIN:B00005JKCH Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)]] the CGI is ok, but not too realistic. My older brother reminded me of it with the long string of cheese extended from his mouth to the pizza slice in his hand, like how Spider-man shot out his web to attach from building-to-building to swing along. \\"Swing Along with Spider-Man\\" would be a good song title, don't you think? It's a fun, light weight movie, but too bad his romance didn't go further. [Jesus told them (Adam & Eve) to go for it.] What's wrong with these guys? Do they think they can't have some fun to celebrate their glorious victories over evil? They are really missing the whole show boat here. Just the original film and DVD format is enough for me. Personally I like real acting with real actors and real stunts, not too much computerized action-acting.
B000VWYNNW|4.0|There is no question that the quality of the remaster is profoundly superior to the original. For that reason alone, I highly recommend it.  Add in the bonus tracks and you have really the entire concert from MSG in 1973.  Having said that, it really is a different album than the original soundtrack. There is a sense of revisionist history as Page has chosen not only remix but rework nearly every song. If you know every nuance of the original, as I do, then you will be somewhat surprised when you come across the additions and subtractions. For instance, in Dazed and Confused, there is the unmistakable splicing of parts of the three concerts to make up something that was obviously more pleasing to Page's ears than the original. That bothers me a little bit. Same thing in No Quarter.  Also, it seems that JPJ's bass was pushed a little to the background in some songs where it really stood out it the original, no doubt to make the lead guitar shine a little more. I think that Jimmy may have been massaging his ego a bit in the remix. But he is the master and knows how to market his product. Some fans may really dig the differences; I was hoping to hear a better sounding version of the tracks that I have come to know and love so well, but what I got was really a different album altogether. However, I know it will grow on me.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore haters will find inconsequential morsels and the same red herrings in this documentary that make them come out with their usual rhetorical irrelevancies and self-righteous posturing. For instance, Moore takes a band of sick 9/11 rescuers to Cuba, since they can't find help in the US for their problems. He doesn't show how they get to Cuba, nor that the help they receive there is from premiere service centers reserved for political elites only, and not for common Cubans. Yes yes. He also doesn't deal with the ugly side of Canadian and British health systems: long waits that can be life threatening, high tax rates, and many Canadians coming to the US to get immediate care. Yes yes.<br /><br />But what about everything else Moore brings out? Absurd denials of services from US HMOs based on cheapness even when primary care doctors urge these services as crucial? These widespread denials routinely cause grief and even death. Nixon and Haldeman cooking up with Kaiser a get-rich-quick health care scheme specifically designed to deny services rather than provide them? Doctors in England who are financially rewarded for preventive care, not denial of care?  On and on we go. We are all familiar with our \\"carriers\\" and the rubbish they dispense to us, the high deductibles, the lack of coverage, the insistence that we go to their network doctors, the unwillingness to cover \\"experimental\\" services and drugs that can save us. Even rich conservatives admit the system is broken, but they don't want to \\"nationalize\\" (read pay for) a fix. They'd rather die with their money in their coffins than spend it for the better good of all of us. We are ranked well below other nations for life expectancy. And what of those miserable patients who are driven to a street corner and dumped like garbage because they can't pay their bills? Is there any denying of that? Or did Moore stage these scenes too? I don't think so.<br /><br />I say thank God for Michael Moore and his courage in stirring up trouble, making people aware of how awful things are, and how we compare and what we look like to the world community. Our system is laughable in England, in France, in Canada, and in Norway. Why is that? One word: GREED! We have lost our sense of community in America, in spite of all the flag waving and anthem singing. A true patriot cares about the least of us and ensures we all are taken care of equally. We have lost our leaders, people like FDR who understood the need for sacrifice to raise up our common standard of living. What is the point of creating an oligarchy in the US? Bush and the Republicans have advanced such an oligarchic agenda incredibly in the past 7 years. It's time for the backlash. It's time for the vast majority to rise up and push back.ouble, making people aware of how awful things are, and how we compare and what we look like to the world community.

1400063515|5.0|The Black Swan is one of the best critical thinking books I have ever read.  Taleb uses the analogy of a Black Swan to symbolize his thesis - that significant, but unexpected, events occur and determine history, but we are blindsided by these events because our minds are fixated on the status quo.<br /><br />With the knowledge that the dinosaurs had, could they have ever imagined getting wiped out by an asteroid impact?  Who would have guessed that the transistor, invented in the late 1920s, would cascade to the invention of computers, the Internet, and the way we share information.  Such events are Black Swans.<br /><br />The elusive thing about the Black Swan is that they are difficult, if not impossible, to accurately predict.  However, Nassim Taleb does his best to examine the scenarios that brew Black Swans and uses an interesting array of terminology such as \\"Mediocristan\\" vs. \\"Extremistan\\" to describe where Black Swans are likely to occur.<br /><br />The most interesting part of Taleb's thesis are his explanations for why we are so shocked when the Black Swan arrives.  He does an excellent job analyzing the way we are trained to think; our minds are so wrapped up in the status quo and the information we have that we tend to forget about the unknown unknowns.<br /><br />Taleb examines how our minds naturally fall victim to fallacies such as statistical biases and what he calls the \\"ludic fallacy\\" of mathematical modeling.  These fallacies cause us to overlook the big picture and miss the devastating Black Swans lurking.<br /><br />I was happy to finally see someone with the guts to attack the academic means of thinking with a structured, rational argument.  He vigorously discredits the eggheads who try simplifying the real world such as the stock market into their mathematical models.  (Remember, these are the same eggheads who put together Long Term Capital Management.)  Among the flawed models he points out is the Modern Portfolio Theory, which is taught to MBAs around the world, but is almost never practical.<br /><br />References to ancient philosophers and every day news events keep the book interesting and give it a worldly sense.  Taleb's terrific tongue-in-cheek humor makes it entertaining as well.  You won't regret delving into this intuitive and practical new chapter to critical thinking.er practical.

B000V6BE6M|5.0|Over the past few years, as a so-called 'Classical Music' fan, I've become more and more interested in film scores. The classic composers, Korngold, Steiner, Herrmann, Rozsa, Goldsmith, Tiomkin, and many others, all have written music that not only worked wonderfully with the films, but worked on its own terms. Now, with the release of the final complete score for The Return of the King, we can see the entire piece, almost 10 hours of it, as a single work. It is rich in thematic content, with innumerable melodies that will stick in you head, lyricism, and drama. It is filled with interesting instruments and sounds, both tonal and atonal, and utilizes a vast pallet of color. It is a remarkable achievement. Wonderful choral work (in invented languages, no less!) is mixed with delicate solo work from performers well-known in clasical circles, such as Renee Fleming and James Galway. What is amazing to me is how well it stands on its own.  There are very few 'dead spots', especially given that this is the complete score, on 4 cds.   It is natural to think of that other 'Ring', Wagner's, when considering this work. And I would not wish to suggest that they are comparable, though Shore himself spoke of this score as his 'opera'. Yet it is a vast and wonderful work, quite moving, often exciting, and almost always interesting. He was given an unusual amount of time to write it, and the result is a score of astonishing complexity.  A few details. The packaging, as for the previous two, is quite elegant. The notes are good (and on line you can download a more detailed analysis on some 50 pages or so). Also, it comes with a single dvd on which the entire score (2 sides) can be played. Sound is good to very good - on my system, I notice no particular difference in quality between the cds and the dvd.  Criticisms are minor. If you have little interest in the movie, this may not be for you. If your taste in music veers away from the Classical or folk-like, this might not be your cup of tea either. There is a fair amount of repitition (but so is there in Wagner) and you might not be overly fond of some of the solo singing (Liv Tyler's song is a bit weak, and some may not like Annie Lenox, though I do, very much). You probably should be a fairly serious fan of the movies in order to appreciate the score to its fullest (that however, would also be true of Wagner, or of any opera or vocal work). There is a sweet nod of the head to Wagner at the end. It is also a real investment. And finally, you can buy single cd versions of the score of each of the movies, which might be enough. But I have to say - not for me. I like the whole architecture of the work. I'm just amazed that they went to the trouble of releasing this, as well as the other two. It suggests a labor of love.

B000EF7W3Y|5.0|I just wanted to say that the remastered sound on this CD is great and the second disc fulfills what Closer To Heaven (ie - Fisherman's Blues II) failed to do.  Overall, one of the best albums of the '80s, one of the best Irish (even if they are Scots) albums ever, one of the best folk/roots/rock albums ever.  Just fantastic.  So even if you already own the original album, this is worth picking up for the sound quality and extra disc of Fisherman's sessions.
B00005JPLW|3.0|Ok history buffs, this movie isn't for you.  The story loosely follows historical events, but it is more into the fantastical realm. Now, I could understand it being made from the point of view of the Greeks at the time, the fantastical creatures were their perception of normal people.  But, in general, it's inspiring and gripping. A fun movie, if you accept the fact that it's *not* fact.

B000W4KT6E|5.0|Having been a long-time fan of the original, I approached this DVD with some trepidation. After all, Divine and Rikki Lake both created iconic characters in the John Water's original 1988 [[ASIN:B00006RZ9Y Hairspray]], and John Travolta's association with the homophobic cult of Scientology made me nervous about how Edna would be portrayed. Imagine both my surprise and delight when one of the most affecting song and dance numbers in the new movie (adapted from the Broadway play adapted from the original movie...) was Travolta and Christopher Walken soft-shoeing to \\"You're Timeless to Me.\\"<br /><br />That is how surprisingly good this humorously gentle take on race and social politics in the early sixties is. It marks one of the few movie musicals to have successfully navigated the transition from play to screen this decades ([[ASIN:B00005JLSE Chicago]] and [[ASIN:B00005QZ7U Moulin Rouge]] come to mind) as opposed to the ones that couldn't ([[ASIN:B000E1YVZU Rent]] and [[ASIN:B000EWBKMG The Producers]]). So much so that Hairspray 2007 is a better movie that Hairspray 1998. It may irk some purists to see that, as many of the one star Amazon reviews have indicated, but I see this movie as a potential classic comedy ala [[ASIN:B000022TSW South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]. Having Waters himself make a deliciously tacky cameo in the opening number indicates that he was more than happy to help this movie come to life.<br /><br />What helps is the pitch-perfect cast. Starting with new discovery Nikki Blonsky, who makes the Rikki Lake part of Tracy all her own. As she struggles to overcome her limitations and dance her way onto The Corny Collins Show, she meets new friends and new enemies (Velma von Tussle - Michelle Pfeiffer reprising Debbie Harry's role as a nasty queen-bee). But Tracy's new friends teach her the best dances, get her noticed by teen-heartthrob Linc (Zac Efron, seeming to channel another John Waters actor from [[ASIN:B0009IOR6Q Cry Baby,]], one Johnny Depp), and get her on the brink of becoming Miss Hairspray.<br /><br />As things become complicated and Tracy realizes that doing the right thing can be more important than winning a prize, the trademark Waters irreverent humor kicks into high gear. While Waters' involvement in the movie/play was as consultant and ultimately signing his approval, the screenplay by Leslie Dixon is so close in tone that you'd never know otherwise. And the songs by Mark Shaiman, Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan are tongue in cheek beauty. The closest musicals of recent vintage this even compares to are [[ASIN:B00004RF8J Little Shop of Horrors]] and [[ASIN:B000022TSW South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut]] (whose \\"Mountain Town\\" opening number seems a close cousin to Tracy's \\"Good Morning Baltimore\\"). The positive message delivered through the uplifting music and great performances (even minor roles, like Queen Latifah, Elijah Kelly, Amanda Bynes and Jerry Stiller -- returning from the original movie! -- are note-perfect) make this one of 2007's best summer movies; heart and soul instead of boom and bang.on the brink of becoming Miss Hairspray.

0151013047|4.0|First some caveats. From its cleverly misleading title to its ambiguous ending, this post-9/11 novella promises somewhat more than it delivers. Written as a long ancient mariner-like monologue, it tells a story of a journey from Pakistan to America and then back again. In its attempt to blend the personal with the political, it chooses a curious angle by dwelling at length on the subject of nostalgia. A wealthy, attractive young American woman falls victim to a kind of unredeemable mourning for a dead lover, while the Pakistani protagonist and narrator falls into a similar emotional quagmire when she is unable to return his growing love for her. Meanwhile, he understands the reaction of the U.S. to the 9/11 attacks as a kind of nostalgia for a past that no longer exists while riding roughshod in its bruising retaliations on the rest of the world. Juggling an identity in America as an outsider (a Muslim, impoverished by comparison with his fellow students at Princeton), he is mentored, in the high-powered New York consulting firm that hires him, by another self-identifed \\"outsider,\\" who eventually gives a glimpse into his personal life that openly hints at other reasons to account for his feelings of otherness.<br /><br />In interviews, Hamid has said the book is about his ambivalence toward America (love-hate is probably too strong a term for it), but what the book has to say about that is not terribly new or original. Only a reader steadfastly untuned to the rest of the world over the last decade would be surprised by what he has to say about American arrogance and indifference to those who stand in the way of its ambitions and self-interest. Likewise, his decision to leave a lucrative but soulless job will seem rather predictable. And while there's a bit of suspense in the ambiguity of the narrator's intentions (is he benign or malicious?), this element of plot seems grafted on sometimes as a device to maintain the interest of readers unabsorbed by the author's ideas. Well written and thought provoking, the book has its rewarding moments, nonetheless, and deserves a reading.ll written and thought provoking, the book has its rewarding moments, nonetheless, and deserves a reading.

0783116934|5.0|This fact-based film tells of a search for a serial killer in pre-glasnost Russia. The detective, played by Stephen Rea, and his superior, Donald Sutherland, make a fascinating partnership, as one is impatient and driven and the other is well schooled in the careful manipulations required to gain advantage in an oppressive bureaucracy. Each learns from the other, until at the end they have nearly switched roles. The well crafted script provides a psychological depth by revealing the identity of the murderer early on.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Jos Ackland, as a domineering Party official, and Imelda Stuanton as the detective's wife, who can easily steal a scene by lifting an eyebrow. Also fine is Max von Sydow, as a psychiatrist who lends his support to the search for the killer, while others retreat in fear that their professional lives will be compromised. Finally, while the killer never becomes sympathetic, we gain some understanding of the humiliations that drive his murderous behavior, and the eventual confession scene is gripping and hard to watch. An excellent production from start to finish, the film is yet another example of HBO at its best.

BUT all is not well in the land of all things Martha. speaking as a pastry chef myself, some of these recipes are not complete and if you don't know what is missing you will follow these recipes to the letter & think YOU messed up. for instance--the mexican wedding cookies on page 96. why is the cookie dough so dry you may ask? becuz the recipe is missing eggs. whoever heard of a cookie recipe w/o eggs? baking soda is also missing from this recipe as well. after i added all the necessary things they were perfect but i had to do some serious testing first!  some of her cakes & icings have no vanilla in them--most do some do not. a cake w/o vanilla extract? the linzertorte is good but its too sweet w/ the jam included, so cut the sugar in half, add your favorite jam & you'll have a perfect linzertorte.  im careful about making too many things from this book becuz i dont always have time to test things so i tend to look at her recipes & then compare them to the tried & true ones i already know.     there are very few recipe books particularly by celebrity chefs who's recipes i trust 100% so i ALWAYS test things before i make it for others.  you should always do the same. this book unfortunately is no expection.

Bruce Wayne is the mask BATMAN wears!   The HD version is truy amaing! You will not be disappointed!     Can't wait until the DARK KNIGHT in summer of 2008!
0525950079|5.0|Even if one hasn't read Pillars of the Earth, World Without End is a wonderful, lustrous, rich sidebboard of elaborate desserts.  There is intrigue, passion, treachery, greed, lust, irony, war, sacrifice - there are Kings, Lords, fiefs, wenches, nuns, abusers and abused, all interwoven in clever plots, and painted into a background of England in the Middle Ages and the Hundred Years War.       This is a book to get lost in, wallow in. A book to mourn the finishing of..... A truly, truly great read.

B000MXPE74|5.0|Costello Music in a nutshell; Fun, bouncy, good music.  Everyone knows one song from the Ipod commercials, but the rest of the music is great on this album too.<br />I listen to it whenever I am either driving or doing housework, because it makes the more mundane tasks much more fun to get thorugh. It is really bouncy, moving music - and I can't help but to feel good and dance about whenever it is playing in the house.
0307387151|5.0|This novel set initially in 1935 is essentially a tale about the potential for destructive consequences when imagination and creativity, not tempered by maturity, are applied to social relationships. The main character is Briony Tallis, a thirteen-year-old aspiring writer, who has led a mostly solitary existence in an English country manor - her much older siblings attending college, her mother confined to bed with migraines, and her father consumed with work in the city.<br /><br />A chain of events is set in motion with the prospective visit of brother Leon - sister Cecilia having already arrived for the summer. Briony has written a play, The Trials of Arabella, for the occasion, but her cousins conscripted as actors are proving to not be capable. Further frustrations and miscomprehensions occur as the romantic interactions of sister \\"Cee\\" and Robbie Turner, a gardener on the estate and Cambridge graduate subsidized by their family, prove to be the undoing of Briony. In fact, Briony is so mystified by what she sees that she fingers Robbie for an assault - not of Cee - because she is so certain that he is a maniac.<br /><br />Briony after several years realizes her egregious mistake and its ramifications: Cecilia completely disowning her family and Robbie being incarcerated and forced to be a part of the English military force in France that failed to repel the Germans.<br /><br />At the end we see the seventy-seven-year-old Briony having written her final novel, one of atonement, concerning the devastation that she has caused in the lives of two people with so much promise. And in fact, the novel here seems to be that novel with an ending that assuages the terrible guilt that Briony has born for nearly sixty-four years.<br /><br />Beyond the basic plot, the book surely captures the flavor of the times and the world of social elites. The last half of the book movingly captures the horrors of WWII, especially for the English, by following Robbie in France and Briony as a probationary nurse in London. The movie with the same title is good, but the book is better.as a probationary nurse in London. The movie with the same title is good, but the book is better.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|I always watched Macgyver when it was on for the 7 seasons and taped almost every episode.  Decided I wanted them on DVD when they came out.  Although I only have the 1st season I shall get more in the future.      One of my favorite shows on TV.  Thank you.      Rainey
B0000640S1|5.0|When I've had a bad day dealing with idiots on the road, clients who can barely figure out how to read and relatives who treat me like dirt, First Blood is there to help me mete out my mental revenge with every gunshot, missle firing, cop-thrashing and wanna-be soldier bashing that happens!<br /><br />This film is a revenge-fest for anyone wanting a healthy way to release pent-up agression against typical Republican idiots and you'll save big money by skipping those tawdry S&M home scenes that are just a bore compared.  Besides, nobody has room for all the accoutrement these days.<br /><br />Johnnie Rambo is just minding his business when a typical small-town, power hungry cop decides he needs to control someone (reminds me of a lot of my past bosses) and gives him a really hard time.  Welllll, let me tell you, Rambo gets 'em all back and then some.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes is when he shoots up the Police Station and then sets the local sporting goods/ammo depot to blaze with explosive results. Oh! Oh!  And let's not forget when the fat, stupid cop takes a plunge from the helicopter and has his cocktail hour - on the rocks!<br /><br />My personal No. 1 pick for watching after a bad day.  After all, at least I didn't have to crawl through an old abandoned mine filled with rats, did I?
B000I2J0VK|2.0|I was expecting a much better video quality in HD but I do not see any difference with the regular DVD format! I guess there's not much to improve on, scenes are mostly in soft, almost filtered quality shots!  HD is more impressive on sharp images and high contrast. This is a waste of time and money on transfer from DVD to HD-DVD!

B000UD08HW|5.0|Whether you are a David Gilmour and/or Pink Floyd fan or not, this concert is incredible!  The Blu-ray version of this DVD only enchances an already incredible video capture of a magical performance.  The setting is simply overwhelming in the Royal Albert Hall, home to so many historic concert venues.  Gilmour continues to play with great artistry, whether from his own recent album \\"On an Island\\" or older Pink Floyd cuts.  With the addition of Crosby, Nash and Bowie, this Blu-ray DVD is a wonderful addition to anyone's collection of memorable concerts.  Get it!!
0440419514|5.0|I purchased this trilogy out of curiosity, after reading a chain email from a well intentioned friend which cautioned all God Fearing Christians to shun this series.   The Golden Compass ; beautiful, entertaining, fabulous word pictures, clever irony, well spun plot. The only reason it is unsuitable for your younger readers is that several children die in it. It's not blasphemous, anti God, or anything of the sort. The Church directed humor is funny.  The Subtle Knife : I am only half way through, but it is also a good read. A bit darker than the first book of the trilogy.  At church, a good friend of mine cautioned me that the third book ends with telling the kids to all go out and kill God. I doubt if that is what the book is going to say, but I intend to read it for myself and find out.  Shame on those who spread rumors about good literature without reading it for themselves first. But it is kind of a fascinating thing, that human nature has not progressed as far as we think it has in this enlightened, more educated age.

1400082773|5.0|This life story gains credibility from not being a presidential candidate promotion.  Written just after graduating from Harvard, Obama wrote it to figure out his own life, which consisted of a mixed race parentage and growing up in  various environments.  It tells of the difficulties he got through and how he grew through them to succeed at Harvard and to give back through his community service.  It's the story of an intelligent young man who learned to understand and appreciate his mixed background and to relate to the diverse influences on his life choosing the best as his models.  An interestiong and inspiring aaccount of who he is.  Ideal for helping to know a presidential candidate.

B000VR824S|4.0|Once again, Eric Clapton puts together a wonderful show!  I had heard the name of some of these artists before, but didn't know what they sounded like.  Derek Trucks and Albert Lee are such examples.  This show is a fine collection of performances across the spectrum (rock, country, blues).  My favorite is John Mayer, who may be the next Clapton!  My only disappointment is how crazy Bill Murray is.  Maybe that's what they were looking for as a host, but I think they could have done better.  Overall, it's as enjoyable as the first Crossroads Guitar Festival.
B000W4KT64|5.0|This is a fun movie fit for the whole family.  Music is great - makes me want to get up and dance with them. I grew up in the early 60's so the music as well as the black/white issues of the day were spot on. I've seen the stage production several times and I'm glad the movie kept true to the originals.  Nikki Blonsky was wonderful and energetic and John Travolta was absolutely fabulous!  A great addition to any family movie collection!
075640407X|5.0|(My only five-star review in years.)    Let me see: Appealing characters, unpredictable story line, intelligent and imaginative narrative.    With so many lame fantasy novels from \\"top fantasy authors\\" published recently, you'll be shocked at how wonderful this is, and perhaps it will inspire those slackers.     A book I'll even reread someday - a rarity for me.    For those of you who were a bit disappointed with Guy Gavriel Kay's latest, this one won't disappoint.     And, if you're wondering what to read after Harry Potter, sink your teeth into this.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I have watched Blade Runner more times than any other movie I own.  If I could take only one movie with me, if we were evacuated for a hurricane, it would be Blade Runner.  Every time that I watch it, new images are created and new character dimensions appear as if I were viewing the movie for the first time.  Whether you like the version with the voice-over, which is my absolute favorite, or another version with a different ending, this movie presents dimensions of life and our possible future that are too strong to ignore.
B000Z0OX9O|1.0|Not even close to what an original soundtrack should be.  An indulgent and shameful mess from a spent composer who must have thought this THING was clever.  The score for Blade Runner remains Vangelis' masterpiece... a great pity he doesn't know this and instead continues to muck it all up.  Save your money and find a technically inferior bootleg... it'll will bring you more pleasure than this head ache.  Better yet, buy my copy.  What a waste.

She is funny and open and honest as she experiences different cultures and finds peace and happiness.  I enjoyed this book.

B000RJO578|4.0|I loved Shaun of the Dead and this one is just as good! A definate classic of dry British humour. Have watched it several times now and still not bored of it.
B000VWYNNW|3.0|I got this 2 CD set last week after hearing the tail end of the \\"new\\" Whole Lotta Love on the radio. I thought they had actually released a different performance based on the short part I heard.  I have owned the vinyl and then the CD versions of TSRTS for over 20 years and I have every note of every solo memorized so it wasn't hard to pick up the vastly expanded and cleaned up sound, as well as the fact there was additional material here.  I will agree with other reviews - the sound quality is phenomenal.  On a good stereo or with headphones this is the next best thing to being there.  The new songs are a total thrill to hear in the mix.  Since I've Been Loving You, Heartbreaker, and Black Dog in their entirety are spectacularly better than I remember from the film.        BUT after listening to the entire new CD I am left with a bad taste in my mouth, as if there was a splash of ketchup thrown on my filet mignon.  There are extra bars inserted in some songs vs. the original TSRTS.  I never knew the songs had been so edited in the first place.  This was disappointing in itself, finding the songs I knew and loved so well in the past weren't even \\"authentic\\".  But answer this -  if they saw fit to put some edited parts back in, WHY do we get additional edits removing stuff that WAS in the original release?  Listen to the sorry edit at 5:20 in No Quarter and you see what I mean.  Originally there was a mellow John Paul Jones keyboard solo with Jimmy taking a turn at rhythm guitar, then segueing into a nice guitar solo.  Instead that mellow 1:45 of song is HACKED out and it transitions to arrive rudely at the end of the guitar solo and launch into a more aggressive part immediately.  If some of this stuff had been done in the original release, at least it flowed to the point I never noticed it.  There are other less flagrant edits throughout the collection, and another obnoxious one in Whole Lotta Love.  The whole thing is disappointing to me.  While there are elementsof a great performance here, I can't get behind it as a work of art.  I figured the songs weren't in the same sequence as performed live, and likely had been recorded on different nights.  But multiple edits within a LIVE song?  WTF!?  I want to pretend I was THERE and get to hear what the audience heard! Instead I get a studio fabrication.    On the plus side, the more casual Zep fan will love this.  It is likely now the best quality live recordings available of Zeppelin at their rockin' and artistic peak.  No one rocks, has rocked, or ever will rock again like these 4 men did.  A full scale listen thru of this set will leave you awed, drained, and wishing you had a time machine to go back to 1973.  But if you are into authenticity, you will have to stick with the bootlegs until Jimmy comes to his senses and gives us what we really want.  I'm for the triple CD set mentioned by another reviewer.

B000W04S6U|5.0|The Halo 3 OST is an amazing compilation of practically every Halo 3 song in the game. Its great to hear some of my all time favorites which were amazing even though they were recorded with software instruments, now be re-recorded and arranged using a huge orchestra and choir. If you've enjoyed previous Halo music, you will absolutely not be disappointed by this CD. Marty is a genius, and there are so many amazing songs across these two disks, I definitely recommend the purchase!
B000G8NY4U|3.0|Not anything like his World Concerts , but still great with a handpicked few musicians
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Great sounding headphones and very comfortable.  Bought these to replace my Sony V6's of 10 years (broken due to my nephew sitting on them), which were still in great shape.  So, $150 was my maximum amount that I was willing to spend on a pair of headphones for home, since I already have my pair of Shure e5's for when I'm out-and-about.  I decided on these after reading a whole bunch of reviews and after trying out several headphones (Sony V6's/MDR-V900's, Sennheiser HD-280's, Bose Triports), but the K240 stood out as the clear winner for me, even next to the more expensive K271's.  The headphones are extremely comfortable and were made even more so when I added a set of Nice Cans headphone covers (the stock pleather ones got a little sweaty and sticky when I wore them for more than an hour).  The suspension system is pure genius taking the weight and tension off the ears and putting it on the top of my head, even after wearing for 4 or more hours.  Also, if the cord ever get's destroyed or develops a short, it can be replaced by unplugging the existing one and putting a new one on.  As a matter of fact, each individual part can be bought from AKG and replaced if one wears out (which I highly doubt).  All in all, after a month of use, these have completely left the V6's in the history books.  As time goes on and the drivers loosen up even more, the sound gets better and better!  They do need a little time to sound as good as their potential, like my Shure's, so have a little patience.  I would recommend these phones to anyone, especially if using an ipod or any other low power audio device.  Great phones and enjoy!
B000FL7CAK|5.0|The Show was Great---It was a series of episodes with a Major Crime being solved as the show aired each week. Kristin Bell deserves  to be on a show of her own. The DVD's are Great--extras super also.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Maybe Tom Joad sums up the plight of the migrants and Okies best when he tells Ma that he'll \\"be everywhere\\" at the story's apex, that he will be willing to keep the fight alive and carry on what Jim Casy the preacher wanted for their people. The Joads are just one family, and we certainly expect that each family moving from the south and Midwest to California would have their share of setbacks during the Depression era 1930s, but they embody much more than just a fight for a better life. The Joads' exodus westward is the hope for the American Dream personified; they have to fight not only the resistance to go back from their own family, but the various injustices and prejudiced opinions of those who don't want them in their part of the country. They leave many of their cherished possessions behind (we see this as Ma looks over her possessions one last time in the early part of the film), and they go west with a sense of both optimism and fear.     One great aspect of John Ford's film is the role he filled for various characters. John Carradine does an excellent job as the preacher Jim Casy, from the beginning scene where he meets Tom Joad as they embark towards the Joad house, to him reflecting on the hypocrisy he feels towards preaching. While the film does not get into Casy's character at the depth the novel does (which was probably impossible due to the length of the book), Carradine does an excellent job of making Casy's character come to life visually from novel to film. Henry Ford in a superb choice for Tom Joad, and he is able to bring forth the rebellious nature to this character, as well as a change from beginning to end, from a man who wants to \\"just get along\\" to a man who wants to take up a fight for a people. Another fantastic choice was Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, exemplifying the role of keeping the family together at all costs. It is easy to see why she won an Oscar for her role.     Another overlooked aspect is just the cinematography, the wonderful scenery and lighting. There is the scene at the beginning where we see Tom and Casy walking across the field, which seems to parallel and foreshadow their spiritual quest later on. There is the scene where Tom and Casy go into the desolate house, into complete darkness, and the eeriness of the scene is captured as they meet \\"graveyard ghost\\" Muley Graves, who refuses to leave his home. And then there is the final scene where no lighting is used when Ma and Tom meet for the last time while at the camps, appropriate and fitting for the moment. Ford does an excellent job of creating mood with various camera angles and lighting.     Ford does an excellent job of bring Steinbeck's story of the Okies, the migrants of the Dust Bowl, to life. This is a significant part of our history, a film that everyone should see, and based on a book that everyone should read. A great book that parallels Steinbeck's novel and gives accounts of personal migrants traveling to the west is \\"Dustbowl Okie Exodus\\" by Dorothy Rose, a series of poems about the quest westward.     This film may not \\"wow\\" some of moviegoers today; the film is simply made and simply told, exactly how it should be. Its importance lies in that it is a significant part of our history.     It's not hard to see why this is one of the top movies of all time.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This is a fun package.  However, is anyone else  tired of receiving brand new DVDs,  fresh from the manufacturer,  with scratches on the  brand new disks?  At this point it is not worth my time to deal with return and exchange.  Get a clue, Warner Home Video....arrange some quality control !    And I should add that athough the BladeRunner content sells itself,  of what I breezed through of Ridley Scott's   introductory comments...he seems somewhat bored by the whole thing
0425210480|2.0|This is the first Cussler book I have read, and probably the last.  It seemed like a great idea for a book, but it fell flat.  Here are some general comments:    -Two of the characters were in Rio (Brazil) and there is a comment that one of them speaks perfect Spanish.  Even grade school kids know they speak Portugese in Brazil.  Fact checkers?  -The Austin hero seemed to only be capable of one-liner, smart-alec sentences.  Same thing with Zavala, Gamay, and her husband.  Every one of them were virtually interchangeable.  Comic book dialog at its finest.    I found them totally unbelievable and rather unlikeable.  -All characters except for Karl are one-dimensional, with the possible exception of the bad guy who turned good.  -Karl was a GREAT character.  Seldom a wise-crack, capable of compassion and killing, not in perfect health.  He seemed like a real person.  More characters with anywhere near his depth would be a big improvement.  -What in the world did miniature wooley mamoths have to do with anything?  This really has me puzzled.  -A car chase featuring a Stanley Steamer?  -designing and building the antidote on a 747 in about a day and a half?  Wouldn't it have been easier to strap some cruise missiles on the 747 and destroy the ship that way?  Or just let the Air Force do it.  -It seems to me it would have been a lot easier, and surefire, to have the Navy or Airforce. or both, destroy the bad guy's ship with an airstrike.  Oh, I forgot, the president was too busy reviewing tornado damage and couldn't be bothered with something so trivial as the entire world as we know it coming to an end.  Plus, that would have made Kovacs granddaugher irrelevant.  -This isn't a criticism, but I don't know why they used the name Laszlo Kovacs for the Hungarian scientist.  Laszlo Kovacs is the name of a Hungarian-born Hollywood cinematographer who filmed, among many other movies, Easy Rider and Ghostbusters.  Must be some kind of inside joke.    In summary:  Good premise, bad characters.
031286504X|3.0|I loved the beginning and the middle of the book. I thought Matheson had a really good treat wrapped up in a beautifully horrifying and action packed horror ride with the books' advanced and highly descriptive writing. He really did a good job forcing the reader to become Neville, not just sympathize and feel pity for the character. I really felt alone and isolated, I really felt like I was going insane, it really stimulated the imagination because everything was written in vivid detail. Near the end of the book is what sapped some enjoyment and sucked two stars from this review. The short stories made me feel as if I was cheated out of a potentially enthralling ending.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This documentary is the most amazing I've ever seen.  Here you get to enjoy the beauty and wonders of our world in a way that you've never seen before.  The coolest thing is at the end of each documentary section, they show you all they went through in order to appreciate even more what you are watching.  Buy it, you won't regret it.
B000000W5P|4.0|As an album that starts with \\"Miss You,\\" a pop song that represented 1978 pretty well, I see Some Girls as a Stones cross-section - the album that unites the true blooded rockers of old with the culture-savvy grandpa's that made mediocre albums and occasionally a great song from then on out.  Some Girls isn't a perfect record, but it is a standout in the Stones catalog because it does have elements of the Stones of old and the pop of new - even an old-soul remake of \\"Just My Imagination\\" sounds punchy and wild, and closing with \\"Shattered,\\" it allowed the Stones to get more unhinged than usual.  But I really see the album as one long groan between its two masterpieces: \\"When The Whip Comes Down,\\" a great rocker with its punch and simplicity, and \\"Beast of Burden,\\" the set's most famous song that seems such a triumph listening to the whole album because nothing since \\"Whip\\" has its charisma and effortlessness.  Now, that doesn't mean everything else on the record is not great - I loved \\"Imagination\\" and the bad-attitude r/b of \\"Some Girls.\\"  But as good of an album as Some Girls is, it doesn't ring as true or as easily as a great Stones record, and the truth is their transition into Grandpa-dom had already begun.  Still, a band that makes a song as sexy as \\"Beast of Burden\\" is clearly not yet at risk of burning out, and that is more than a little of a relief.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|I saw the movie in the theatres and the DVD.  I really enjoyed the movie, lots of action.  The DVD is fine, I have no problems or complaints about it.  If you like the movie and want to have the DVD to watch it at your leisure, then I recommend buying it.
0316666343|4.0|While The Lovely Bones is not the best book I have read, I was not disappointed when I finished the Novel.  This Book held my attention throughout the entire story and I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read.
B000HBKCDC|1.0|It's not that hard to create a great Christmas Album, and it' hard to believe a talent like Sarah McLachlan created Wintersong. This is a boring Christmas album. The song selection is partially to blame as each song is slower than the next. In my opinion, this album completely fails to capture the joy of the holiday. The songs while well done are not anything special or memorable. None of Sarah's versions of these classic Christmas tunes is a standout and I doubt they will be remembered past this Christmas. I was very disappointed.
B000YABYLA|4.0|Ellen Page is the sixteen-year-old title character in \\"Juno.\\" Although she has unprotected sex with her boyfriend, Paulie Bleeker, she is incredulous when her home pregnancy test comes out positive three straight times.  Although her parents are understandably dismayed when Juno tells them the startling news, they are more supportive than furious.  Allison Janney is Bren, Juno's kind and witty stepmother, who is squarely on her stepdaughter's side no matter what.  The ever-reliable character actor, J. K. Simmons, is solid as Juno's nurturing dad.  He fondly calls Juno \\"Junebug,\\" gives her sage advice, and makes sure that she always remembers how much he cares for her.<br /><br />\\"Juno\\" is tailor-made for teenage girls; they will love the film's edgy score and will identify with this child/woman who has no idea who she is or what she wants out of life.  The performances are uniformly excellent. Ellen Page is perfect as a young lady with a big mouth and an aggressive personality who needs to grow up in a hurry.  Michael Cera is adorable as Juno's geeky boyfriend, Paulie.  Although he is academically accomplished, Paulie is ordinary looking and unsophisticated.  However, he is also sweet, unassuming, and extremely attached to Juno.  Jennifer Garner is poignant as Vanessa Loring, a childless woman who has everything money can buy, but fervently desires the one thing money can't buy--her own baby.  Jason Bateman plays Mark Loring, Vanessa's good looking but immature husband.<br /><br />Diablo Cody's script is reminiscent of a Gilmore Girls episode; everyone seems to have a quip suitable for every occasion.  Although the screenplay is at times too self-consciously cute, it is also original, amusing, and ultimately touching.  Juno is a nice kid who wants to do the right thing; it is refreshing to see a teenager who is so adored by her parents that she finds herself able to love others freely and altruistically.  Since the viewer cannot guess how the film will end, there is an element of suspense as well.  All in all, \\"Juno\\" is an entertaining, funny, and bittersweet coming of age story about what happens when babies have babies.f suspense as well.  All in all, \\"Juno\\" is an entertaining, funny, and bittersweet coming of age story about what happens when babies have babies.

B000002UB6|1.0|With the type of career they had it's easy to overlook this abomination but still it stains. No one really cares about Mcartney's emotional problems while recording this album. The guys really needed some curly fries, hot dogs and beer and a good listen to this album. Then they would have burnt the masters. I know people might want to flame me but I challenge any one person to tell me this is their favourite Beatles long player? or that this any more than 10% as good as Revolver. Look past your love for the artist and see this long player for what it is.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|In this day and age of no-talent pop artists and re-hashing rockers, I've found inspiration and beauty in Brandi Carlile's music.  Her music ranges from heart-wrenching folks songs (Turpentine and Late Morning Lullaby) to hard rocking ballads (My Song and The Story) about love and growing up.  From the very moment I heard her Self-Titled album I was a die hard fan and not just of one song...the whole album! Brandi Carlile's music will either hit you hard and hook you or oddly enough you will only like one song and not the rest.  But either way, you are adding beauty to your CD collection. This is the only band I've ever heard that has a cello player that knows how to play along to rock music plus dual as a piano player.  The twins Phil and Tim Hanseroth will blow you away with their melodies.  Brandi Carlile's voice will leave you breathless.  Freaking brilliant.  Go to a concert!

B000OYC7A8|5.0|Pink Floyd singer and guitarist David Gilmour just released his new DVD entitled Remember That Night - Live From the Royal Albert Hall and is indeed a MUST for all David Gilmour and Pink Floyd fans.<br />I got the Best Buy version (with a bonus live CD including the AOL Sessions EP) and I have already watched this DVD three times and it is SUPERB! For those who were at The Royal Albert Hall and/or any of his solo shows (I envy you) this is a great souvenir and for those of us who weren't (like me) it shows us what we all missed.<br />There are 23 (technically 25 counting the outro and the intermission) songs on the concert disc of 'Remember That Night', which documents the Royal Albert Hall shows of May 29, 30 and 31, 2006.<br />Gilmour was backed onstage by fellow Floyd member keyboard player Rick Wright, PF 1987 alum which were keyboard player Jon Carin and bass player Guy Pratt, Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera and drummer Steve DiStanislao. Plus, there are guest appearances by David Crosby, Graham Nash (2/3 of Crosby, Stills and Nash and/or 1/2 of Crosby Stills Nash and Young take your pick), Robert Wyatt and the Thin White Duke and rock music's real chameleon David Bowie.<br />The first set begins with three from Dark Side of the Moon which are \\"Speak to Me\\", \\"Breathe\\", \\"Time\\" and \\"Breathe (Reprise)\\" (all are excellent versions).

B00005J6T0|5.0|When this album first came out I thought it was stupid Pop Music.<br />As I listen to it more on MTV I started to like the album more.<br />You have to understand when this album came out I was more into<br />Heavy Metal like IRON MAIDEN, OZZY, VAN HALEN, DAVID LEE ROTH, and<br />MOTLEY CRUE.<br />So this was a little softer than I was a custom too, and by the way<br />I am Italian.<br />I think this is one of the best albums Madoona ever did.<br />I rate this CD a 5 of 5 stars!!
B00004SVID|5.0|Pink Floyd's live version of their 1979 classic The Wall entitled Is There Anybody Out There?: The Wall Live 1980-81 was released in April of 2000.<br />The double live album was released to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the band's masterpiece double album The Wall. The album was originally slated for release in late 1999 but producer James Guthrie (who co-produced the original album) had to literally bake the master tapes to get the sticky glue off after the master tapes had been sitting in storage for years. Also, the band had problems with their US record companies. The band had just inked a new deal with Capitol/EMI worldwide for distribution to their catalog and were set to release but Columbia/Sony for the US and Canada were initially against the album but reluctantly agreed to release the album as the band's final album with Sony in the US and Canada after the band switched labels which were licensed the music (the band have the final say on what gets released and not released).<br />Is There Anybody Out There? was recorded at London's Earls Court Arena during the band's performances of The Wall in August of 1980 and June of 1981, the shows were a bona fide spectacle. More than anything, Is There Anybody Out There? captures the volume, the bombast and the grandeur of these famed performances with remarkable accuracy.<br />These performances are astonishingly faithful to the band's studio versions although the band does get to stretch out on In the Flesh(pt. 1), The Thin Ice, Another Brick in the Wall(pt.1), Another Brick in the Wall(pt. 2), Mother, Goodbye Blue Sky, Young Lust, Hey You, Comfortably Numb, The Show Must Go On, In the Flesh(pt.2), Run Like Hell and Outside the Wall with either extra guitar solos from David Gilmour showing why he is one of rock's greatest guitarists or extra keyboard solos from keyboard player Rick Wright (who passed away September 15, 2008 and was playing The Wall shows as a paid musician after Waters fired him) or extra verses or extended musical pieces.<br />The other tracks Empty Spaces, One of My Turns, Don't Leave Me Now, Another Brick in the Wall(pt. 3), Is There Anybody Out There?, Nobody Home, Vera, Bring the Boys Back Home, Waiting For the Worms, Stop! and The Trial were arguably better than its studio counterparts although remained faithful to them.<br />Although they were kicked out in 1979 and 1982 respectively by Roger Waters due to his uncontrollable ego, co-founders keyboard player Rick Wright (God bless his soul) and drummer Nick Mason played better than on the studio version of The Wall, especially Rick whose Hammond Organ work buries that of its studio counterpart. Roger Waters didn't play much bass on this live album as he perfectly recreated the role of Pink and left Andy Bown to play bass in his place. David Gilmour's musical arrangements and guitar and vocals were spot on as well (Roger's performance of The Wall without his ex-colleagues in 1990 was pathetic).<br />Run Like Hell is classic with Roger Waters' classic intro and Gilmour and Waters trading vocal lines.<br />This live Wall album also includes two unreleased tracks. \\"What Shall We Do Now\\" was left off the original release due to space constraints and \\"The Last Few Bricks\\" was a reprise of Happiest Days, Young Lust and Empty Spaces as an instrumental for wall builders to catch up to the band.<br />Also, Storm Thorgerson's artwork of the four Floyd member face masks is striking (he also fell out with Waters originally during Animals) and the booklets have recollections from the four Floyd members plus road crew and stage designers with some cool pictures of the band on stage.<br />This live album did well for a \\"from the vault\\" release hitting #19 on the Billboard album charts and #1 on the Internet Album Sales chart and went Platinum here in the States within a month of its release. This live album has zero overdubs and is up there as one of the greatest live albums I ever heard next to Pink Floyd's Pulse, Led Zeppelin's How the West Was Won or The Song Remains the Same 2007 re-issue, Rush's Rush in Rio, Queen's Queen Rock Montreal, David Gilmour's Live in Gdansk, The Who's Live at Leeds (especially the 2001 reissue), Genesis' Seconds Out and Supertramp's Paris among many others.<br />Highly recommended!West Was Won or The Song Remains the Same 2007 re-issue, Rush's Rush in Rio, Queen's Queen Rock Montreal, David Gilmour's Live in Gdansk, The Who's Live at Leeds (especially the 2001 reissue), Genesis' Seconds Out and Supertramp's Paris among many others.

B000VDDESQ|5.0|There's not much else to say.  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend.  The quality is beautiful.  (And it's a great movie).
B00008CLOA|5.0|In March of 2003, Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon celebrated its 30th anniversary.<br />Originally released in March of 1973, The Dark Side of the Moon was the band's first number one album here in the United States of America and has stayed on the charts for nearly an accumulated 1,300 plus weeks (741 weeks from 1973-88 and many more now from 1991 - today where it still remains). Plus, The Dark Side of the Moon is the third largest selling album worldwide with some 35 million copies sold (including 15 million here in the US but should be updated for recertification now).<br />Sales went up thanks to the release of this Hybrid SACD version. This new version was painstakingly remixed in 5.1 Surround Sound from the original 16 track master tapes by longtime Floyd producer/engineer James Guthrie. The previous album issues were from second or third generation masters but this new version buries all other editions, especially the Quad (1970s version of 5.1 that didn't get off the ground) mix that Dark Side engineer Alan Parsons did for the failed Quadraphonic format.<br />There is a good reason why this album has held up for the last 31 years and it's because the songs deal with problems that one goes through in life and the production was many years ahead of its time. This was the first album that ever touched me in the heart, I used to go to sleep listening to Dark Side when I was a baby because lullabies wouldn't work half the time so when all else failed, my mother would put Dark Side on the turntable and it did the trick. Consequently, I became a die-hard Floyd fanatic, which I still am today.<br />Dark Side of the Moon started out life as a piece called Eclipse and eventually became Dark Side of the Moon. Guitarist/singer David Gilmour's vocals and guitar solos dominate throughout the album as does keyboard player Rick Wright's keyboard work and harmony vocals.<br />This album has survived the test of time like no other album ever made before or since.<br />As everyone knows, the album was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London between June of 1972 and January of 1973 with the band producing and Alan Parsons (whom would go on to be a succesful producer in his own right) engineering the album with Chris Thomas (whom had worked with The Beatles and became a producer in his own right working with Pete Townshend, Roxy Music and The Pretenders among others) handling the mixing.<br />All of the songs dealt with different topics that one experiences in life like \\"Time\\" (with clock noises (superbly sounding better with the 5.1 mix) and about racing against or managing time) and \\"Us and Them\\" (a song about the perils of war and is still relevant today). Note: the music of Us and Them was originally intended for the 1970 film Zabriske Point during the riot scenes and was called The Violent Sequence but director Antonioni rejected it in favor of another Careful With That Axe Eugene entitled Come In Number 51 but was luckily resurrected for the album's best track. The echoes on the Us, Them, Me, You, etc. swirl around you on this 5.1 mix.<br />Instrumentals like \\"Speak to Me\\" (featuring voices that are dominant throughout the album and with a heartbeat that was done on drummer Nick Mason's bass drum which opens and closes the disc) and \\"On the Run\\" which was originally a guitar jam entitled The Travel Sequence changed into this eight note Synthi-A VCS3 synthesizer pattern complete with tape effects and guitar noises. Note: there are extra guitar noises not on the original stereo mix and on the 5.1 mix which is superb. \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" was originally called The Religious Sequence before it changed into this instrumental about death and dying and featured the excellent vocal phrasings of Clare Torry. \\"Any Colour You Like\\" (which was originally called Scat during the preliminary stages of the album) is excellent as well.<br />The other tracks are classics. Aside the aforementioned Us and Them and Time, you get classics like \\"Breathe\\" (which was originally written during the recording of bass player/singer/lyricist Roger Waters' first solo project The Body with different lyrics and music save the Breathe in the Air refrain), \\"Money\\" (which eventually became Pink Floyd's first American Top 20 hit and one of the few singles released with a 7/4 time signature and was about the pleasures and negatives that money brought) and the closing one-two punch of \\"Brain Damage\\" (a song referencing to original Floyd leader Syd Barrett and absent friends and there are extra bells during the ending synth solo on the 5.1 mix) and \\"Eclipse\\" (which sums up the album) wrap up this classic of an album.<br />This album is a must in anyone's record collection and the remastering on this SACD done by James Guthrie and Doug Sax buries the 1992 and 1995 reissues by a longshot!<br />When this SACD reissue of The Dark Side of the Moon came out, it went straight to #1 on the Billboard Pop Catalog chart with huge sales and remains the best selling SACD to date.<br />Highly recommended!ritten during the recording of bass player/singer/lyricist Roger Waters' first solo project The Body with different lyrics and music save the Breathe in the Air refrain), \\"Money\\" (which eventually became Pink Floyd's first American Top 20 hit and one of the few singles released with a 7/4 time signature and was about the pleasures and negatives that money brought) and the closing one-two punch of \\"Brain Damage\\" (a song referencing to original Floyd leader Syd Barrett and absent friends and there are extra bells during the ending synth solo on the 5.1 mix) and \\"Eclipse\\" (which sums up the album) wrap up this classic of an album.

B000002IST|5.0|Genesis' final studio album with lead singer/drummer Phil Collins entitled We Can't Dance was released in November of 1991.<br />The album was the band's first album in five years since the monster smash Invisible Touch. In between that album and its tour, Phil had appeared in the movie Buster (which its soundtrack spawned two US #1 hits for Phil out of \\"A Groovy Kind of Love\\" and \\"Two Hearts\\") and released his fourth solo album the brilliant But Seriously (which hit #1 and sold millions Stateside) and went on the Serious Tour. Guitarist/bass player Mike Rutherford released two more Mike and the Mechanics albums The Living Years (which its title track was a US #1 hit) and Word of Mouth and also pursued his interest in polo (as the comedian George Carlin calls polo \\"golf on horseback\\"). Keyboard player Tony Banks recorded his third solo album Bankstatement and was recording his fourth solo disc Still (which would not be released in the US until 1992).<br />Then in 1991, Banks, Collins and Rutherford got together with Nick Davis (whom had done solo projects for Banks and Rutherford) and began recording the album We Can't Dance. When the album was released in late 1991 fans didn't know if either it was a great record or the band ran out of energy, read on.<br />We begin the album with the six minute epic \\"No Son of Mine\\" which deals with a very personal and troubled Father-Son relationship. The song was a US hit single and what a great album opener. Next is the comedic \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\" which pokes fun at the TV evangelists that occurred during that time. Its video was hilarious with the guys in leisure suits and fake wigs mocking the preachers. This track was the last US single from the album. Next is the first of two 10 plus minute epics \\"Driving the Last Spike\\" which is about England's railway workers. Next is \\"I Can't Dance\\" which was a rightfully great hit single. Its video was priceless with the band poking fun at the jean and model ads popular at the time. Next is the ballad \\"Never a Time\\" which is a great ballad. Next is the epic \\"Dreaming While You Sleep\\". This seven minutes epic shows Genesis didn't lose their prog side to their music.<br />The album's second half starts with \\"Tell Me Why\\" which is a nice Beatles-ish sounding piece about the sociological problems of the world. Next is the excellent poppish \\"Living Forever\\" with excellent guitar work by Rutherford. Next is the album's third single and most memorable ballad \\"Hold on My Heart\\". Nice ballad. Next is the excellent \\"Way of the World\\" which is another piece about the problems in the world. Next is Phil's song for Eric Clapton's son who passed away that March called \\"Since I Lost You\\" which is a nice piece. We close the album and the Collins tenure with Genesis with the epic \\"Fading Lights\\". This piece includes a lot of elements of Genesis from their progressive days (long instrumental) in between the short vocal passages.<br />We Can't Dance reached #4 on the Billboard album chart and has sold four million copies in the US alone to date. While some fans don't like the record, We Can't Dance was a great album and (as of 2009) a great way to end Collins' tenure with Genesis and IMHO the real last Genesis album.<br />RECOMMENDED!t is the ballad \\"Never a Time\\" which is a great ballad.

B00005QDW5|5.0|Pink Floyd's retrospective Echoes was released in November of 2001.<br />When I first got wind of Echoes at first, I thought at first worthless but then after hearing that \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" was finally being issued on an album, I said what the hey.<br />Echoes is not like many best ofs that go year to year which is what Roger Waters wanted, the songs go from one to the next like your average Floyd album which is how David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Rick Wright and longtime co-producer/engineer James Guthrie saw it. Many fans and Floyd bashers, stop whining or go to listen to the regular albums (the Floyd fans) or your Britney Spears records (some one star reviewers who bash this record for no apparent reason)!<br />It was impossible to put a collection of Pink Floyd songs together that would please everyone. I think the non-chronological placing of these songs adds something new to the mix and the transitions between some of these songs create a mosaic of music just as these songs did on their original albums. My favorite is between Us and Them and Learning to Fly. The classics are here Astronomy Domine, \\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives, \\"Another Brick in the Wall (pt.2)\\", The Great Gig in the Sky, Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun, Money, Time, Keep Talking, One of These Days, Us and Them, Arnold Layne, See Emily Play, Wish You Were Here, Comfortably Numb and Learning to Fly appear as does lost classics like The Fletcher Memorial Home, Jugband Blues, Sheep, Sorrow and Bike.<br />Some of the songs were edited. For instance, Echoes is reduced to 16 and a half minutes like it was on the band's 1987 tour when they played it for three weeks. Shine on You Crazy Diamond is edited into one long suite with a bit of the guitar solo from Part 3 missing and some of Part 6's lap steel solo shaved off and the intro to Welcome to the Machine missing and of course parts 8 and 9 are cut. Marooned is reduced to two minutes to serve as a bridge between Hey You and Great Gig in the Sky. Also, High Hopes has some of the intro effects, the ending lap steel guitar solo and the final bell tolls edited. The reason many hardcore fans bought this, including myself was the inclusion of When the Tigers Broke Free which was not on an album until this collection's release in 2001 (now it is on the reissued Final Cut album as of 2004).<br />Echoes did very well when it was released debuting at #2 in the US and selling over 3 million in the US alone (it was held off #1 by Britney Spears' Britney here in the States whilst in the UK Floyd outcharted Britney) reaffirming Pink Floyd's place in history as the most successful art rock band ever.<br />Highly recommended!Sky.

What Shall We Do Now was left off the original release due to space constraints and The Last Few Bricks was a reprise of Happiest Days, Young Lust and Empty Spaces as an instrumental for wall builders to catch up to the band.   Also, Storm Thorgerson's artwork of the four Floyd member face masks is striking and the book has recollections from the four Floyd members plus road crew and stage designers with some cool pictures.   This live album did well for a from the vault release hitting #19 on the album charts and #1 on the Internet Album Sales chart and went Platinum in a month of its release. This live album has zero overdubs and is one of the best live albums I ever heard next to Pink Floyd's Pulse, Led Zeppelin's How the West Was Won and The Song Remains the Same 2-CD reissue, Rush's Different Stages, Queen's Queen Rock Montreal, Genesis' Seconds Out, The Who's Live at Leeds and Supertramp's Paris among many others.   Highly recommended!
B000VR824S|5.0|This is the first music DVD I have bought. I just can't say enough good things about the performances on these discs. If you have a surround sound system, the audio is just about as good as being there. The only shortcoming I have with this is that I wish that they had included more Jeff Beck. I know that they could have made this much longer by adding more discs, but the overall is just amazing.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|This is my favorite period in Pink Floyd history- and there really isn't one I don't like.  So much of FLoyd's early material is bootlegged and/or expensive, it's such a blessing to have a high quality performance with some of my favorite songs recorded here.  It is haunting and beautiful and they couldn't have chosen a better location for this concert and footage.  I think they did a wonderful job editting it too for this Director's Cut.
B000Y44LBG|5.0|American Gangster is the story of a druglord. During the Vietnam War, 1/3rd of the American army were supposedly into drug abuse whilst in Middle East. One man took notice of this. He decided to import heroine and sundry drugs from the same source. Washington playing Frank Lucas gives the performance of a lifetime. This is one of the few films that have little or no flaws, it's 2hours 30mins plus yet it is uniquely engaging. A recommendation for any fan of Crime, Drama and Americana. Another great film that came out earlier this year is Eastern Promises. Anyhow, American Gangster is a complete winner.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I bought this DVD mostly because I had heard the soundtrack and thought it was beautiful. In the first week I owned this movie I watched it three times. Each time I watched it I enjoyed it that much more. There is no dialogue, just music and animation.  This movie is based on an award winning childrens book, but is so good that it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Initially I thought the animation seemed a little unpolished.  But the more I watched it, the more I felt that the apparent simplicity of it was what made it both unique and enjoyable. The story, also simple but beatiful, is about a boy and his snowman and how an ordinary winter day becomes truly magical. If you're looking for a short film that captures the beauty of quiet winter days and a wonderful imagination, this is it.

B000HIVQLW|5.0|Pink Floyd's 2-CD retrospective entitled Echoes was released in November of 2001.<br />When I first got wind of Echoes at first, I thought it was going to be worthless but then after hearing that the then rare track When the Tigers Broke Free was finally being issued on an album (it then appeared albeit in a remixed form on the 2004 re-issue of The Final Cut), I said what the hey and took the plunge into buying Echoes.<br />Echoes is not like many best ofs that go year to year which is what Roger Waters wanted, the songs go from one to the next like your average Pink Floyd album which is how David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Rick Wright and longtime co-producer/engineer James Guthrie saw it. Many fans and Floyd bashers either stop whining and crying or go to listen to the regular albums (to the Floyd fans) or your Britney Spears and Beyonce records (some one star reviewers who bash this record for no reason)!<br />It was impossible to put a collection of Pink Floyd songs together that would please everyone. I think the non-chronological placing of these songs adds something new to the mix and the transitions between some of these songs create a mosaic of music just as these songs did on their original albums. My favorite segue is between Us and Them and Learning to Fly. The classics are here such as Astronomy Domine, See Emily Play, The Happiest Days of Our Lives, Another Brick in the Wall (pt.2), Hey You, The Great Gig in the Sky, Money, Keep Talking, Time, Comfortably Numb (with outro to Bring the Boys Back Home at the start), One of These Days, Us and Them, Learning to Fly, Arnold Layne and Wish You Were Here appear as does lost classics like Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun, The Fletcher Memorial Home, Jugband Blues (one of the late Syd Barrett's best pieces), Sheep (from the overlooked Animals), Sorrow (one of PF 1987's best epics) and Bike.<br />Some of the songs were edited. For instance, Echoes is reduced to 16 and a half minutes like it was on the band's 1987 tour when they played it for three weeks and it works fine. Shine on You Crazy Diamond is edited into one long suite with a bit of the guitar solo from Part 3 missing and some of Part 6's lap steel solo shaved off and the intro to Welcome to the Machine missing and of course parts 8 and 9 are cut but a great edit. Marooned is reduced to two minutes to serve as a bridge between Hey You and The Great Gig in the Sky. Also, High Hopes has some of the intro effects, the ending lap steel guitar solo and the final bell tolls edited but most of this epic is left intact. The reason many hardcore fans bought this, including myself was the inclusion of When the Tigers Broke Free which was not on an album until this collection's release in 2001(now it is on the reissued Final Cut album but in a remixed form with part of The Wall film version for the first verse and the single mix for the second and third verses but the Echoes version was the melding of the film version).<br />Echoes did very well when it was released debuting at #2 in the US and selling over four million copies in the US alone (it was held off #1 by Britney Spears' Britney here in the States whilst in the UK Floyd outcharted Britney (a/k/a the skankaroo)) reaffirming Pink Floyd's place in history as the most successful progressive rock band ever.<br />In 2006, the album was repackaged with a biodegradable wrap which reminds me of the shrink wrap that they used with Wish You Were Here on the 1975 vinyl record.<br />Highly recommended!when they played it for three weeks and it works fine.

B000002J0P|4.0|As the 1960s wore on, many songwriters began to feel constrained by the limitations of the group formula. In the wake of Beatlemania, virtual identikit groups had sprung up on both sides of the Atlantic. In England, one such group - The Hollies - had manufactured a pop sound based on fairly complex vocal harmonies and chiming twelve string guitar. Across the pond The Byrds had set about inventing folk-rock with a sound also based on vocal harmonies and ringing chords. Slightly later, a group called Buffalo Springfield had been formed in Los Angeles with an initially similar Beatles-style sound.      As the baby-boomer youth of the Western world found themselves increasingly disenchanted with a stuffy Establishment who'd taken them to pointless wars (Suez, Vietnam) and became more enamoured of recreational avenues of escape (literature, art, music, philosophy, religion, drugs) some of them found voices in songwriters who happened to be in such groups.  David Crosby of The Byrds, Graham Nash of The Hollies and Stephen Stills of Buffalo Springfield gradually carved out creative and personal reputations as liberated romantic idealists, harbingers of the talked up 'Age of Aquarius' where the baby-boomers would inherit the earth and make it a better place.     By the winter of 1967, Crosby's polemicism had fired him from The Byrds and Stephen Stills was at his wits' end over the moody antics of bandmember Neil Young.  Both had begun to write more adventurously, placing a mirror to society and - crucially - to themselves. Through 1968 they individually demoed a series of songs, which would later form the backbone of the 1970s folk rock movement. Crosby, influenced by jazz and indian music in particular, tended to write in unconventional tunings.  Stills veered slightly more to a country and blues tinged sound.      Meanwhile, Nash was growing increasingly restless with The Hollies. A failing marriage and a time of self-discovery was reflected in his more  personal songs, which were not to the taste of his band.  On one of many tours of the States, Nash found himself jamming with Crosby and Stills at Cass Elliot's house (of The Mamas and the Papas).  Mutual admiration turned to wide-eyed wonder as Nash's voice joined with Crosby's and Still's to make the most arresting and moving harmonised sound of the decade.  With Nash still in The Hollies, Stills and Crosby set about seducing him away from his steady job to join them permanently. In early '69 they went into the studio to set down their sound.    The result is, with Led Zeppelin, one of the two albums that would define the sound of rock music for the best part of the 1970s.  It established the format of the band as a union of singer songwriters and from the start it was agreed that band members could release solo efforts or any other collaborations as they so wished.    'Crosby, Stills and Nash' has had practically every applicable hyperbole and cliche thrown at it.  Casting such expectations aside, on the one hand it suffers somewhat because of over-solemnising and lazy lyrics; on the other hand Crosby, Nash and Stills attain new artistic heights both individually and as a unit.  The production and musicianship throughout is also superb - thanks to Stills who produced and played nearly every instrument.    There are great swells on this album where the harmonies lock into place and we're taken to places only a few groups - The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Beach Boys etc - have reached. 'Suite: Judy blue eyes', 'Wooden Ships' and '49 Bye-Byes' are the ensemble high water marks and, ultimately, the pieces by which the album is made. The first song soars and falls over a D tuned acoustic guitar, which stylistically journeys to latin music via raga and folk.  The opening harmonies must be one of the defining sounds of modern music, and provided another nail in the coffin for The Beatles. All three songs share Still's predilection for Hendrix-like riffing on the electric guitar with funky motown bass.     Nevertheless this is known as 'the acoustic album' and other songs like   'You don't have to cry', 'Helplessly hoping, 'Lady of the island' and 'Guinnevere' reinforce the epithet. Nash's 'Lady of the island' is particularly captivating if one leaves cynicism at the door. At best, it is charmingly devoid of all but a soft counterpoint harmony from Crosby and a guitar simply echoing the melody. At worst, it slips into mawkish senimentality. 'Guinnevere' manages to sound both entrancing and unsettling at the same time with easily Crosby's best tune.  It enigmatically refers to three women, two of whom - Joni Mitchell and Christine Hinton - were one time lovers of him. The third woman's name remains a mystery.    If these songs are rather heavy in subject matter, relief comes in Nash's travellogues 'Pre-road downs' and 'Marrakesh express'.  The latter was a hit but has aged rather less well than the former. 'Marrakesh''s inclusion appears rather as if a song was placed in the album so it had a radio hit, even if the subject matter does fit the time.'Pre-road downs' speeds by on electric guitar looped backwards and became a live favourite.    The song I leave till last, 'Long time gone' portends the follow-up 'Deja Vu'. It is explicitly political, 'Don't try to get yourself elected. If you do you had better cut your hair' and was written by Crosby the night Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968.  Apparently Stills and the albums' drummer - Dallas Taylor - stayed up the night to work out an effective backing track. The result is a brooding work of siren-like organ and snarling guitar that summarises the unease of the politicised youth more effectively than The Stones' 'Street fighting man' or The Beatles' 'Revolution'.  For once, Crosby manages to stay on the right side of good taste where later he would often venture into grandiloquent cliche on tracks like 'Almost cut my hair'.    I don't know if I'd call this an essential album but it's undoubtedlyone of the most accomplished albums of the 1960s and remains as vital a document of that era's youth generation as any.

Sure it's got a great cast especially Michael Keaton as Lightning's rival Chick Hick with George Carlin and splendid CGI animation, but it's not quite original like the other works of Pixar cause this movie will remind viewers of the Michael J. Fox movie \\"Doc Hollywood\\" with it's similar plot. But luckily this year's \\"Rataoullie\\" was a vast improvement on this movie, but i believe \\"Happy Feet\\" with the highly underrated \\"Monster House\\" did much better then this movie back in 2006 when it comes to unique CGI animated movies.<br /><br />This DVD contains a load of cool extras like two short films, a featurette on how they made the movie and deleted scenes, it is very good but thankfully \\"Ratatoulie\\" was better.
B000UX6THK|5.0|To me this is the best TV series ever. It has it all, from drama and tragedy to comedy and little homages to other arts. The images, the dialogues, the characters, the actors, the scenery, the music, the themes. All is great and profound. I saw it long ago and then again on Bravo. For some time I lamented not recording it, because I couldn't find it on any video store, plus, the only DVD version contained only one season. So I waited and waited. Finally it's here. I saw it completely in a couple of days and the experience of not having to wait one week for the next chapter was great. I you are watching it for the first time, watch the original pilot, not the international version, leave that to see after you finish the complete series, because it has some information that will be revealed later on. The extras on the DVDs are great, specially the documentaries about the making of the pilot, the two seasons and the music. The only bad thing is that this box doesn't have the extras the other DVD sets of seasons 1 & 2 have. For example, the chapters with commentaries. I don't know if this is because of legal issues or just to make some fans buy them all. But, apart from that, this is a great investment that you won't regret and will revisit again and again. I don't know if I prefer the White or the Black Lodge. Too bad there's no third season, that could have answered my dilemma.
B000T05R8Q|5.0|Pink Floyd's debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn was originally released in August of 1967 and was re-released in two different versions for its 40th anniversary in September of 2007 by Capitol Records (a 2-CD version remaster and this 3-CD box set).<br />In August of 1967, Pink Floyd released their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in the UK and a month later in the US as The Pink Floyd.<br />This was the first introduction to a band that would conquer the world in a few years time. The band consisted of bassist Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason (credited as Nicky on this album's original sleeve), keyboardist Rick Wright and guitarist/vocalist and main songwriter Syd Barrett, whom was the mad genius of the band.<br />The members of the band were in groups known as The Abdabs, The Megadeaths and The T-Set among others until Syd hooked up with childhood friend Roger and Roger's architectural school classmates Rick and Nick and another friend Bob Close to form the group The Pink Floyd which was named after two old Georgia bluesmen Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. Bob Close left after recording Syd's demo of Lucy Leave.<br />Throughout 1966, the band were a concert sensation in London's underground music movement and proceeded to get a deal with EMI in Europe and was signed to EMI's US affiliate Capitol under the subsidary Tower (way before the record chain existed).<br />The band's first two singles were \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"See Emily Play\\" which were both Top 20 hits in England (both appear on this deluxe edition).<br />Then, the group's entered Abbey Road Studios to record their debut sometime in March of 1967 with producer Norman Smith, whom worked with The Beatles from 1962-65. Ironically, The Beatles were in the same building finishing their classic contribution to rock history Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.<br />All but one track on Piper was written or co-written by Syd Barrett. His songs were whimsical works of art.<br />The original UK album started with \\"Astronomy Domine\\", which was about going into space to explore the universe (strangely this song was eliminated off of the original American vinyl release). Next is \\"Lucifer Sam\\", a tale about a Siamese cat. \\"Matilda Mother\\" and \\"Flaming\\" (which was also left off of the original US vinyl release) follow and are great songs. Next is the first of two instrumentals \\"Pow R Toc H\\" which grabs the attention. Next was Roger Waters' first song written for the band \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\\" which is a silly song with some excellent jamming.<br />The second half of the album starts with \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" which was a number the band had played live before signing with EMI and was written by the band. \\"The Gnome\\" follows and is about a gnome named Grimble Crumble. \\"Chapter 24\\" follows and is my favorite Syd track. \\"The Scarecrow\\" follows and is a funny but great song. The album concludes with the whimsical \\"Bike\\" (also left off the original US vinyl release in favor of \\"See Emily Play\\") which then turns into a collage of sound effects and duck-call noises.<br />The album showed Syd at his best before LSD caused his behavior to become erratic and unpredictable and his songwriting skills started to go down the drain.<br />The US version of the album hit the lower reaches of the Billboard Top 200 while the UK version hit #6 in England and the UK version would eventually be released in the US on the double album A Nice Pair in 1973 and properly on CD on its owm in 1987.<br />The 2-CD set (and this 3-CD set) has two different mixes of the album both newly remastered by longtime Floyd associate James Guthrie. The first disc is the original mix Syd Barrett commissioned for the band and has some different mixes on some of the tracks as opposed to the original stereo mix we are familiar with which is on disc two of the 2-CD remaster.<br />This collector's edition features a third disc of the band's first three 1967 singles \\"Arnold Layne\\", \\"See Emily Play\\" and \\"Apples and Oranges\\" plus the B-sides \\"Candy and a Currant Bun\\" and \\"Paintbox\\" all newly remastered and are the original mono mixes. Then we get a unique edit of \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" which was from a French EP. Next is the CD debut of the stereo mix of \\"Apples and Oranges\\" which is stunning. Next is an early take of \\"Matilda Mother\\" with alternate lyrics as opposed to the finished product and a great version. We close the third disc with the sixth take of \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" which is possibly one of the best versions I ever heard. Also, the packaging for this 40th anniversary is literally a cloth book and also features unissued photos and a sketch facsimile of a notebook Syd Barrett did in 1965 and is a superb package.<br />This new remastered 3-CD version of the Piper album trumps the original CD, the 1994 remastered CD and 1997 mono mix remastered CD issues by a longshot.<br />Excellent start to an outstanding career.-sides \\"Candy and a Currant Bun\\" and \\"Paintbox\\" all newly remastered and are the original mono mixes.

0679413251|5.0|Dangerous Liaisons (1782)  is an epistolary novel,  the print candy of the voyeur with the slightest degree of imagination.  Laclos has penned letters that weave an intricate toile of lives, loves and hates set in French estates,  countrysides and city scapes. Letters between the two leads, a lechorous libertine male (gentelman is unwarrented in his case) and a Grand Dame of French society (on the surface, manipulative witch is far more accurate) for the crux of the story.  They spend their time manipulating those around them, creating love affairs,  while having strings of assignations with the  (guilty and trouble) puppets.  During the course of  manipulations an increasing antipathy forms between the two main characters.  The manipulated are portrayed in the conspirator's  letters as insipid, stupid near sock puppets - yet  in their own letters they are a moral balance to leading couple.  If you are looking for a guide to manipulation, an etiquette book for the  erotic libertine lifestyle, or a well crafted `hate' `love' story, then  Laclos' Dangerous Liasions (1782), is an excellent choice.

B00005U122|5.0|In 1999, former Pink Floyd bass player/singer/lyricist Roger Waters went on his first US tour in 12 years and didn't know how well he would be received. Surprisingly, Roger did very well on that tour as his ex-bandmates were not touring that year. At the time, Roger was going to record his first proper live album but there was a clause in Roger's deal with EMI in Pink Floyd that he couldn't re-record his OWN songs after he switched to Sony worldwide.<br />After Roger got the rights reversed, he set off on a second US tour based on the success of the 1999 leg and recorded and filmed the In the Flesh album/DVD, released in December, 2000 and December, 2001 respectively.<br />Personally, I think he performed better on the second North American leg than the 1999 leg but in retrospect, the final show in Providence should have been recorded but you can wish in one hand and pour out the other.<br />However, the performance is from Oregon on the DVD is good as it was that July night in 2000 I saw Roger.<br />Roger has a competent band of musicians like drummer Graham Broad and guitarist Andy Fairweather Low but also guitarists Snowy White (whom worked with Floyd in 1977 and 1980) and Texan Doyle Brahmall II (sounds like Stevie Ray Vaughan IMHO) and keyboardist Jon Carin whom ironically played with the post-Waters Floyd in 1987 to 1990 and 1994 and has toured with Waters again in 2006 and 2007 and in David Gilmour's solo tour in 2006.<br />The renditions of the numbers on In the Flesh don't sound too different than their studio versions (In the Flesh, The Happiest Days of Our Lives, Another Brick in the Wall(pt. 2), Mother, Welcome to the Machine, Wish You Were Here, Breathe, Time, Money, Brain Damage, Eclipse and Comfortably Numb) but some of the songs are slightly different than the way Waters' ex-colleagues played them (Shine On You Crazy Diamond and Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun).<br />Floyd fans are pleased to know that Roger included material from Animals (Pigs on the Wing(pt. 1) and a spirited Dogs) and The Final Cut (Get Your Filthy Hands/Southampton medley) which Roger's ex-bandmates don't play live (Animals is too venomous while The Final Cut is despised by Floyd members David Gilmour and Rick Wright).<br />The bass player's solo efforts are represented as well, with spirited versions of Every Strangers Eyes, Perfect Sense (pts. 1 and 2), The Bravery of Being Out of Range, It's a Miracle and Amused to Death. He did The Powers That Be on the 1999 tour but dropped it in 2000.<br />The DVD closes with the new track Each Small Candle which is a worthy song and sounds like an outtake from The Final Cut or Animals.<br />On the DVD are a couple of documentaries and the picture quality is stunning!<br />This DVD and its off-shoot CD is highly recommended.t. 1) and a spirited Dogs) and The Final Cut (Get Your Filthy Hands/Southampton medley) which Roger's ex-bandmates don't play live (Animals is too venomous while The Final Cut is despised by Floyd members David Gilmour and Rick Wright).

B00005JOFQ|4.0|An Outstanding love story.  The over 20 year relationship battles everything life throws at you, Divorce, Kids, Societies Hate toward Gays, and trying to make a living.  This drama is first class with the acting on both men worthy of oscars. I have watched the movie at least 5 times and each time get a better perspective of the inner struggle that (Heath Ledger) endures.  Don't worry, you do not see a bunch of skin and I even recommend teenagers to view film. Thumbs Up.

B000009RC2|5.0|Okay...even I have occasionally referred to \\"Birds of Fire\\" as my favorite MO album...but, let's face it:  THIS was their first and by far BEST album!!!  I won't disect this album song by song.  Overall, the writing, performances by all band members incl. Jan Hammer (keyboards), Jerry Goodman (violin), Rick Laird (bass) and the incomparable Billy Cobham (drums) are beyond exquisite!  McLaughlin's musical vision, power, guitar virtuosity and unique flair for going beyond what most musicians have to offer are demonstrated in this album far above any other he has ever done.  The obscure jazzy time signatures are prevalent, and the compositions hold a casual atmosphere in their stark, but powerful complexity...a beautiful vision that nobody but John McLaughlin could dream up.  As another reviewer stated, this is more an instrumental rock album than a jazz album.  And the artistry and guitar work in this album should be studied by any guitarist in any field...ESPECIALLY ROCK!!!  But most people, even musicians may not fully grasp the infinite lessons and knowledge and wisdom McLaughlin has to teach...but anyone who truly appreciates music...rock and jazz...has to LOVE this album!!!  This is one of the best classic masterpieces of Rock and Fusion ever!  A must have album for guitar fans and fans of the classic art of powerful electric music!!!

Bob Close left after recording Syd's demo of \\"Lucy Leave\\".<br />Throughout 1966, the band were a concert sensation in London's underground music movement and proceeded to get a deal with EMI in Europe and was signed to EMI's US affiliate Capitol under the subsidary Tower (way before the record chain existed).<br />The band's first two singles were \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"See Emily Play\\" which were both Top 20 hits in England.<br />Then, the group's entered Abbey Road Studios to record their debut sometime in March of 1967 with producer Norman Smith, whom worked with The Beatles from 1962-65. Ironically, The Beatles were in the same building finishing their classic contribution to rock history Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.<br />All but one track on Piper was written or co-written by Syd Barrett. His songs were whimsical works of art.<br />The original UK album started with \\"Astronomy Domine\\", which was about going into space to explore the universe (strangely this song was eliminated off of the original American vinyl release). Next is \\"Lucifer Sam\\", a tale about a Siamese cat. \\"Matilda Mother\\" and \\"Flaming\\" (which was also left off of the original US vinyl release) follow and are great songs. Next is the first of two instrumentals \\"Pow R Toc H\\" which grabs the attention. Next was Roger Waters' first song written for the band \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\\" which is a silly song with some excellent jamming.<br />The second half of the album starts with \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" which was a number the band had played live before signing with EMI and was written by the band. \\"The Gnome\\" follows and is about a gnome named Grimble Crumble. \\"Chapter 24\\" follows and is my favorite Syd track. \\"The Scarecrow\\" follows and is a funny but great song. The album concludes with the whimsical \\"Bike\\" (also left off the original US vinyl release in favor of \\"See Emily Play\\") which then turns into a collage of sound effects and duck-call noises.<br />The album showed Syd at his best before LSD caused his behavior to become erratic and unpredictable and his songwriting skills started to go down the drain.<br />The US version of the album hit the lower reaches of the Billboard Top 200 while the UK version hit #6 in England and the UK version would eventually be released in the US on the double album A Nice Pair in 1973 and properly on CD on its owm in 1987.<br />The 2-CD set has two different mixes of the album both newly remastered by longtime Floyd associate James Guthrie. The first disc is the original monaural mix that the late Syd Barrett commissioned for the band and has some different mixes on some of the tracks as opposed to the original stereo mix we are familiar with which is on disc two of this 2-CD remaster. The new remaster is ten times superior to the original CD, the 1994 remastered CD and the 1997 mono CD remaster by a longshot.<br />Excellent start to an outstanding career.ly this song was eliminated off of the original American vinyl release).

B000RG1FMO|2.0|West's Graduation has some redeemable qualities; however overall the album is barely average.  My favorite song is \\"Stronger\\".  However, the chorus and the verses are simply not reconcilable.  He states in the chorus that what does not kill him only makes him stronger, and then goes off on a tangent chasing a girl instead of penning some inspirational lyrics.  I should not be surprised though because his favorite themes in this album are girls, clothes and his talent.  If he does not already have a marketing deal with Louis Vutton he should because he ostentatiously sings their praises on numerous occasions.  This album lacks the lyrical substance that one would expect from someone who has so much to say; especially in light of his unexpected critique of the President.   The music is great but there is so much sampling, that it's hard to give him much credit.       I expect more from Mr. West and hope that he will improve on his lyrics (he may need to go back to school).  Because in this album West's rhymes sound more like nursery rhymes suitable for fifth graders.   This album simply proves that music does not have to be good to sell.  He is at the bottom of the class, far behind Nas, Tupac, Lauryn Hill, Talib Kwali, Mos Def, Common, Outcast etc. etc..
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Pink Floyd released their Live at Pompeii DVD in October of 2003.<br />Pink Floyd first released this concert film Live at Pompeii in late 1972 in the UK.<br />The original film was filmed at the Pompeii Ampitheatre in Pompeii, Italy in October of 1971 with some footage filmed in early 1972 at a Paris film studio. That original version was 61 minutes long, and consisted only of performance footage from the Pompeii amphitheatre and a Paris studio, plus some extra footage of Pompeii. This was shot in full-screen 4:3 and is presented as such on the DVD. The band gave superb readings of Echoes (pt.1), Careful With That Axe Eugene, A Saucerful of Secrets, One of These Days, Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun, Mademoiselle Nobs and Echoes (pt.2). This right here makes the purchase of the DVD justifiable.<br />In early 1973, director Adrian Maben went to Abbey Road Studios while the band was finishing their classic contribution to rock history, the 34 million selling and counting worldwide The Dark Side of the Moon shot some documentary footage of the band recording (or pretending to record according to guitarist/singer David Gilmour because the band were mixing by the time these sequences were filmed) and talking. The new footage was spliced in between some of the original performances for the film and the result was released in August, 1974 here in the US and was now 80 minutes long. Unfortunately, this edit is not on DVD.<br />Now, this new version uses the Abbey Road footage, plus some unearthed black and white footage of the band in a studio in Paris in March of 1972. Also, Maben filmed new shots of Pompeii, a whole bunch of archival footage of space exploration and new titles that look made for a straight-to-video release instead of the Godard-esque ones we had with the original. This is about 91 minutes long, and has been inexplicably matted to a 16:9 format. Although the new interview footage was good, the new computer-generated effects were not that great!<br />Gilmour nor Mason and Wright were involved with this DVD and weren't happy with the Director's Cut. Roger Waters, on the other hand, was and in fact his manager Mark Fenwick was one of the DVD's executive producers and approved of this director's cut.<br />I say buy the DVD for the original film.r Mason and Wright were involved with this DVD and weren't happy with the Director's Cut.

B00006LI4S|5.0|David Gilmour of Pink Floyd released two videos called David Gilmour in Concert.<br />First is the VHS video from 1984 filmed at The Hammersmith Odeon in London in April of 1984.<br />This 1984 concert was filmed towards the end of his 1984 European About Face Tour and features Gilmour plus an all-star band featuring Bad Company guitarist Mick Ralphs, future Firm and AC/DC drummer Chris Slade, future Pete Townshend percussionist Jodi Linscott, keyboard player Gregg Dechart, bass player Mickey Feat and saxophonist Raphael Ravenscroft and they deliver a blistering performance which consists of five tracks from About Face all performed superior to the studio album (\\"Until We Sleep\\", All Lovers Are Deranged\\", \\"Out Of the Blue\\", \\"Blue Light\\" (with a superb Slade and Linscott drum/percussion solo) and a killer version of \\"Murder\\"), two from his 1978 solo debut (\\"There's No Way out of Here\\" and \\"Short and Sweet\\" (performed with Roy Harper (whom sang on \\"Have a Cigar on Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here album))) and two Pink Floyd classics \\"Run Like Hell\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" (which featured Nick Mason of Pink Floyd on drums.<br />The VHS also included videos for \\"Blue Light\\" and \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\". Lastly was a documentary called Beyond the Floyd which documented his 1984 European solo tour. The video is out of print and is a long standing candidate for a DVD release.<br />Then in November of 2002 came another David Gilmour in Concert film.<br />This video (this time around) was taken from the performance he gave at The Royal Festival Hall in London in June of 2001. This show was part of fellow prog rocker Robert Wyatt's Meltdown concert series. For this performance, David Gilmour decided to go in an semi-unplugged fashion.<br />The song list were obvious Floyd favorites (\\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond (parts 1-5 at the beginning with just him and his guitar plus Dick Parry's sax and parts 6 and 7 at the end of the regular set)\\", \\"High Hopes, \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" (with Robert Wyatt on duet vocal)), some forgotten Floyd pieces (\\"Fat Old Sun\\" (a song not performed since 1971), \\"Coming Back to Life\\" and \\"A Great Day for Freedom\\"), a piece from fallen Floyd member the late Syd Barrett's solo career (\\"Terrapin\\"), a part of a French opera (\\"Je Crois Entendre Encore\\" (which was a chore to sing because Gilmour had not sung in French before though can speak in French)), a new song (\\"Smile\\" (in which David told bootleggers to start their machines now) which would not appear on a Gilmour album proper until his 2006 album On an Island), a Richard Thompson song (\\"Dimming of the Day\\") and a song from the 1968 family movie Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (\\"Hushabye Mountain\\").<br />For those who said Roger is Pink, think again after watching this DVD as David was the musical brains and arranger behind the band. Also, the DVD has more footage from David's Royal Festival Hall shows from January of 2002 where he does another Syd song \\"Dominoes\\". Plus, fellow Floyd member keyboard player Rick Wright joined David on a song from Rick's Broken China album called \\"Breakthrough\\" with a great solo from Mr. Gilmour himself and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" with Rick on Fender Rhodes piano and Sir Bob Geldof singing Roger's parts.<br />When I first got this DVD on the day of its release in 2002, I knew I was in for a treat.<br />The extras on this DVD are great like The Spare Digits section which shows guitar fiends how to play some of David's solos. Plus, the hilarious home movies are a hoot to watch (him explaining Je Crois' story was hysterical). Also, three bonus tracks of his collaboration with Mica Paris from 1992, his cover of Elvis' \\"Don't\\" from 2001 and his vocal delivery of the late Michael Kamen and Shakespeare piece \\"Sonnet 18\\" recorded at Gilmour's houseboat the Astoria.<br />This DVD and the 1984 VHS bearing this tile are highly recommended!th Robert Wyatt on duet vocal)), some forgotten Floyd pieces (\\"Fat Old Sun\\" (a song not performed since 1971), \\"Coming Back to Life\\" and \\"A Great Day for Freedom\\"), a piece from fallen Floyd member the late Syd Barrett's solo career (\\"Terrapin\\"), a part of a French opera (\\"Je Crois Entendre Encore\\" (which was a chore to sing because Gilmour had not sung in French before though can speak in French)), a new song (\\"Smile\\" (in which David told bootleggers to start their machines now) which would not appear on a Gilmour album proper until his 2006 album On an Island), a Richard Thompson song (\\"Dimming of the Day\\") and a song from the 1968 family movie Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (\\"Hushabye Mountain\\").

B000E6UK5K|5.0|Pink Floyd's legendary singer and guitarist and one of three chief songwriters David Gilmour's newest solo album entitled On an Island was released in March of 2006.<br />This was Gilmour's first new studio recordings since the 1994 Pink Floyd studio effort The Division Bell and his first proper solo album since 1984's About Face.<br />The album was co-produced by Gilmour along with Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera and Chris Thomas (who had mixed Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and Division Bell albums and has worked with Roxy Music, INXS, Pete Townshend, Paul McCartney and so on) and this album's musical styles run the gamut from Floydish sounding tunes to jazzy to blues, it has it all.<br />Between the releases of Pink Floyd's 1995 live album PULSE (which documented The Division Bell tour) and On an Island in 2006, Gilmour got re-married to Polly Samson in 1994 (who wrote a bulk of the lyrics here) and started a family with her. Also, PF were inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and UK Music Hall of Fame. Helped oversee the release of Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live and Echoes (PF's 2-disc best of). He also did the Meltdown concert in 2001 (released on DVD in 2002) and reunited with Roger Waters and Pink Floyd at Live 8. Also, amidst the happiness in DG's life, he dealt with loss. First, his sister passed away in 2002 shortly followed a year later by first his mother, then arranger/orchestrator Michael Kamen (who worked with PF and its members since 1979's The Wall) and longtime Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke (whom became PF's manager from the moment DG joined the band until his 2003 death). The On an Island album is decicated to his sister and mother plus Kamen, O'Rourke and long-time PF tour manager Tony Howard (who also died in the time between 1994 and 2006).<br />\\"Castellorizon\\" is an awesome instrumental and what a way to start the album. I subtitled this piece \\"Let's Get Metaphysical Part 2\\" with DG's Stratocaster duetting superbly with an orchestra over 2 minutes into the instrumental. We then segue into the title cut to On an Island. It is an awesome song and is already a masterpiece which would not have sounded out of place on a Pink Floyd record. The highlight of this track is Gilmour harmonizing with 66% of Crosby Stills and Nash that being David Crosby and Graham Nash. Also, the guitar solos on this track of course are amazing. \\"The Blue\\" follows and is amazing with DG and fellow Floyd member keyboard player Rick Wright harmonizing on vocals very well (he also plays on On an Island's title cut on organ). Gilmour's whammy pedal solos at the end of the track are amazing and cry shades of Marooned (if they don't sound like Marooned to you then you need ears cleaned). \\"Take a Breath\\" follows and musically reminds me of Coming Back to Life and is a great rocker though some will whine and complain about it and has Gilmour pulling out the stops on both lap steel and Stratocaster for the ending solos. The instrumental \\"Red Sky at Night\\" is awesome and David does a fine job on alto saxophone showing he can play any instrument thrown at his feet and he also does lap steel guitar effects here.<br />\\"This Heaven\\" follows and is a great song which has dirty blues rock guitar over a jazzy shuffle that positively swings and shows David can play any genre of music (he had proven this on his David Gilmour in Concert DVD in 2002 where he sang an excerpt of a French Opera in French and also performed a version of the lullaby Hushabye Mountain). \\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" is a great instrumental in a different sort of tone, kind of reminds me of the Pink Floyd track from Atom Heart Mother called \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast's\\" second section but with some cumbus, glass harmonica and bass harmonica and Robert Wyatt's cornet added. Also, BJ Cole did some great dobro on this track and Gilmour's electric guitar playing here is amazing. \\"Smile\\" follows. I have always liked this song ever since Gilmour firstperformed it in 2001 (at the Meltdown show and appears on his David Gilmour in Concert 2002 DVD) and now sounds complete with David playing some great dobro on this track and strangely enough it is the original demo with an orchestra added. \\"A Pocketful of Stones\\" follows and is a nice ballad which is hard to put into words, arguably the best solo ballad Gilmour has recorded, especially the ending guitar solo gives me a shiver down the spine. The ironically titled \\"Where We Start\\" is a great way to end the album in a nice relaxing tone and cries shades of \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" from Meddle. Like Smile, the vocals and instruments were the actual demo recorded except for the drums and orchestra which were added on later. Still a great song.<br />On the versions that were initially sold at the Best Buy chain, there was a bonus track of an almost 7 minute blues instrumental jam called Island Jam which is a great number.<br />If you go into this album with expectations ala David Gilmour's previous two solo album or even a Pink Floyd album then you will be slightly disappointed but if you are an unbiased fan and appreciate music like yours truly, take a listen!<br />On an Island reached #6 in the US which is his highest charting solo album to date although sales were soft due to gangsta rap, American Idol, High School Musical and James Blunt being what people were buying sadly here in the US. Sales aside, this is a great album.<br />Highly recommended!2001 (at the Meltdown show and appears on his David Gilmour in Concert 2002 DVD) and now sounds complete with David playing some great dobro on this track and strangely enough it is the original demo with an orchestra added. \\"A Pocketful of Stones\\" follows and is a nice ballad which is hard to put into words, arguably the best solo ballad Gilmour has recorded, especially the ending guitar solo gives me a shiver down the spine.

B000PFUAO6|3.0|I am a Dream Theater fan for 14 years. I believe Images and Words, Six Degrees and Scenes from a Memory are the best of their albums.    DT remains my all time favorite band, and through the years I managed to introduce quite a lot of people to DT (who have gone to become TRUE fans).    When Octavarium came out, I was disappointed due to simplistic rock-ballads that dominated the album. Systematic Chaos is possibly even worse but for different reasons. Below are some good and bad points.    GOOD:  Technically brilliant as usual  JLB singing is getting better and better - he is in absolutely awesome form  Some good extended instrumentals  Not too many pop-sounding songs    BAD:  Derivative of other bands and has very few new musical ideas  Growling and chanting (?? This is DT for crying out loud!)  Put together in a hurry  Poor lyrics    I guess, all I can say, everyone ages in their own way. The worst thing about this album is that there is nothing new. Any single song on Sun Caged's Artemisia has more musical ideas than this entire album, and hey, they were once a DT cover band.    I honestly hope next DT album will be more like Images & Words or SFAM.

B000L22WTO|5.0|Pink Floyd singer and guitarist David Gilmour released a solid Extended Play single titled Arnold Layne in late 2006.<br />The 3-song EP is Gilmour's tribute to Pink Floyd founder and his fallen comrade and friend the late Syd Barrett.<br />It consists of two versions of Arnold Layne recorded in May of 2006 plus a version of Dark Globe that almost makes one want to cry at how beautiful it is.<br />The first version of Arnold Layne (which was actually the first Pink Floyd single for those who don't know) was recorded on May 29, 2006 at the Royal Albert Hall with the legendary David Bowie doing a stellar version of the track with Gilmour's band. This track is now on the Remember That Night DVD. Next is another version of the track featuring Pink Floyd keyboard player Rick Wright on vocals and just as stellar as the one with Bowie. This was recorded on May 30, 2006 at Royal Albert Hall.<br />We close things out with Dark Globe (a/k/a Wouldn't You Miss Me) which is an excellent version of the classic Syd Barrett track from The Madcap Laughs which David added to his setlist in the summer of 2006 as a tribute to Syd (in addition to Shine On, Arnold Layne, Astronomy Domine, Dominoes and Wish You Were Here).<br />Contrary to last reviewer's opinions, Wright and Gilmour are the real musical talents of Pink Floyd whom can still sing and play. Roger Waters lost my respect last year with his last tour by pulling a Britney Spears and Ashlee Simpson tactic (lip-synching on stage for SIX SONGS!) and plays the same songs tour after tour with a pale version of Dark Side.<br />This disc is recommended!

0805079831|5.0|For those who read Confessions of An Economic Hitman, this greatly expands on the USA's capitalist destruction of economies world-wide, resulting in ultimate chaos economically.    \\"Hitman\\" expounded on the organized international corporations' US approved takeover of other countries'for purposes of expoitation by these corps mainly connected to or based or controlled in the USA.    One such tactic has been to loan the 3rd world countiries large sums with \\"prohibtive interest and pay-back terms...based on the requirement that such corporations would operate WITH USA CORPORATE CONTROL the economic goings-0on within that now-debter nation...which loan cannot be paid back thus having the US corps take over...and suck that nation's assets out for the benefit of the corps and without any significant sharing of any benefits of such loans.    \The USA controls the World Bank...which is complicit in this destructive tactic.    The Shock Doctrine competes in the same arena. It carries that disgusting tactic to its ultimate extreme and reveals the tactic for what they are: complete domination of the world by int'l corps by making or depending on \\"DISASTERS\\" AT HOME or on FOREIGN SOIL to order to offer to come in and \\"cure\\" or \\"Fix' the disaster!!    Then come in and tgake over the country....sucking the economic life blood out, and leaving a hollow shell in its place.    The author shows how this is the Milton Friedman's exploitative economic philosphy calculated to keep the powerful/wealthy in charge for their own perpetuated benefit.    Likewise, this EVIL philosophy is used NOW: the Iraq war is a current and fine example. A \\"disaster\\" for the purpose of taking over Iraq's oil fields BY USA CORPORATINS...sucking as much out as possible before the Iraqis form their own \\"independent\\" government...which, as we now watch, is destined to become a US satellite so long as we remain there...for the benefit of USA's Int'l Corps.      At home, the domestic needs of americans themselves is thuis thrust aside or awaiting internal disasters (New OrNew Orleans)so as to take advantage of the disaster to benefit CORPARATIONS who receive billions of $$ for \\"reconstruction\\"...clearing the city out and replacing peoples' hoimes with invitations for the wealthy to come in and take up residence in the newly renovated portions.    The more \\"disasters\\", economic, hurricanes, etc,., the better these Shock Doctrine advocates can operate to accumiulate mopre economic power and wealth  in the hands of the few corporatists...and the people be damned.

The highlight of this track is Gilmour harmonizing with 66% of Crosby Stills and Nash that being David Crosby and Graham Nash. Also, the guitar solos on this track of course are amazing. The Blue follows and is amazing with DG and fellow Floyd member keyboardist Rick Wright harmonizing on vocals very well. Gilmour's whammy pedal solos at the end of the track are amazing and cry shades of Marooned (if they don't sound like Marooned to you then you need ears cleaned). Take a Breath follows and musically reminds me of Coming Back to Life and is a great rocker though some will whine and complain about it and has Gilmour pulling out the stops on both lap steel and Stratocaster for the ending solos. The instrumental Red Sky at Night is awesome and David does a fine job on alto saxophone showing he can play any instrument and he also does some superb lap steel guitar effects here.<br />This Heaven follows and is a great song which has dirty blues rock guitar over a jazzy shuffle that positively swings and shows David can play any genre of music (he proved this on his David Gilmour in Concert DVD in 2002 where he sang an excerpt of a French Opera in French and also performed a version of the lullaby Hushabye Mountain). Then I Close My Eyes is a great instrumental in a different sort of tone, kind of reminds me of Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast's second section but with some cumbus, glass harmonica and bass harmonica and Robert Wyatt's cornet added. Also, BJ Cole did some great dobro on this track and Gilmour's electric guitar playing here is amazing. Smile follows. I have always liked this song ever since Gilmour first performed it in 2001 and now sounds complete with David playing some great dobro on this track and strangely enough it is the original demo with an orchestra added. A Pocketful of Stones follows and is a nice ballad which is hard to put into words, arguably the best solo ballad Gilmour has recorded, especially the ending guitar solo gives me a shiver down the spine. The ironically titled Where We Start is a great way to end the album in a nice relaxing tone and cries shades of A Pillow of Winds from Meddle. Like Smile, the vocals and instruments were the actual demo recorded except for the drums and orchestra which were added on later. Still a great song.<br />On the versions that were initially sold at the Best Buy chain, there was a bonus track of an almost 7 minute blues instrumental jam called Island Jam which is a great number.<br />Then in November of 2006, the album was re-released again this time with a DVD which consisted of David Gilmour's AOL Music Session from April of 2006 filmed in New York City with stellar performances of On an Island's title cut, a spirited This Heaven, a laid back version of Smile, a rocking version of Take a Breath, an unearthly version of High Hopes with an ending that will bring a tear toyour eye and a stellar version of Comfortably Numb with Gilmour's Pink Floyd bandmate keyboard player Rick Wright sharing the lead vocal. Also on the DVD is a taster of Gilmour's Royal Albert Hall DVD due out in 2007 with a excellent version of Take a Breath filmed this past May and an excellent version of Astronomy Domine from Abbey Road filmed in August of 2006.<br />If you go into this album with expectations ala David Gilmour's previous two solo album or even a Pink Floyd album then you will be slightly disappointed but if you are an unbiased fan and appreciate music like yours truly, take a listen!<br />Highly recommended!llar version of Comfortably Numb with Gilmour's Pink Floyd bandmate keyboard player Rick Wright sharing the lead vocal.

0143034901|4.0|It seems as if nearly every quote on this book references Gabriel Garcia Marquez.  I've only read One Hundred Years of Solitude but I agree...this book does have distinct similarities.  The lushness of the prose, the larger than life characters, the background sense of  a fairy tale that makes the reader sure that at some point s/he read the words \\"Once Upon a Time\\"...<br /><br />But I detected the whiff of musty rotting lace even stronger than that.  Dickens's Great Expectations seemed to me a much closer relative to \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\".  The sense of the past being relived in the future, the idea that the young characters whose lives are ostensibly the focus of the book being only the newer versions of those who have gone before them...not to mention the constant theme of forbidden love.<br /><br />This book in all senses is a book about time gone by.  It is about passions that are larger than life, all consuming hatred, soul destroying despair.  Nothing is small; no character is simply a bystander, no event without meaning.  The writing drips with color without being too flowery, the words evoke one's senses while still allowing the reader to bring his/her own imagination to the table.  One feels as if this is a story that has always existed, has always been played out...I could almost feel the dust on the book jacket of my brand new copy of this novel.<br /><br />I appreciate, too, the underlying theme of the love of books, of words.  When one encounters \\"The Cemetery of Forgotten Books\\", I felt my hands itching to go there, to see the shelves and shelves of treasures. Books and the power of their words come up again and again, which is an idea I can certainly appreciate.<br /><br />\\"Once, in my father's bookstore, I heard a regular customer say that few things leave a deeper mark on a reader than the first book that finds its way into his heart.  Those first images, the echo of words we think we have left behind, accompany us throughout our lives and sculpt a place in our memory to which, sooner or later - no matter how many books we read, how many worlds we discover, or how much we learn or forget - we will return.\\"<br /><br />While being an engrossing story that kept me turning the pages more than taking notes, the story, whose main timeline takes place in Barcelona in 1955, offers a few very prescient views of the future:<br /><br />\\"Television, my dear Daniel, is the Antichrist, and I can assure you that after only three or four generations, people will no longer even know how to fart on their own and humans will return to living in caves, to medieval savagery, and to the general state of imbecility that slugs overcame back in the Pleistocene era.  Our world will not die as a result of the bomb, as the papers say, it will die of laughter, of banality, of making a joke of everything, and a lousy joke at that.\\"<br /><br />(As a side note, the author does pull one of those plot tricks that I am VERY dubious about.  One of those, \\"In seven days time, SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT WILL HAPPEN\\" warnings.  As an avid reader of Stephen King, I have become very wary of those dire predictions...and I still haven't made up my mind whether they improve or harm the flow of the story, though I am leaning towards harm.)<br /><br />The sense of history repeating itself comes up not only in the lives of the characters but in references to the world in general.  \\"Nothing feeds forgetfulness better than war, Daniel.  We all keep quiet and the try and convince us that what we've seen, what we've done, what we've learned about ourselves and about others, is an illusion, a passing nightmare. Wars have no memory, and nobody has the courage to understand them until there are no voices left to tell what happened, until the moment comes when we no longer recognize them and they return, with another face and another name, to devour what they left behind.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" was a wonderful book to curl up with these past few days.  I liked getting to enjoy damsels in distress, mysterious figures in the shadows, deathbed confessions, duels at dawn, the constant struggle of love trying to overcome hate...and an actual villain with no redeeming qualities.  So often the books that I read, because they are generally based in reality, examine all of the shades of grey that make up human beings.  I'd forgotten what an escape it is to very easily identify the \\"good guys\\" and the \\"bad guys.\\"<br /><br />It's been a long time since I've read a book with a scene like this that I could enjoy instead of rolling my eyes, \\"When I peered into the corridor, I could already hear the footsteps below, near the staircase.  I recognized the spidery shadow on the walls, the black raincoat, the hat pulled down like a hood, and the gun in his hand shining like a scythe.  Fumero.  He had always reminded me of someone, or something, but until then I hadn't understood what.\\"<br /><br />You can just smell the musty odors, see the dripping candle wax, feel the mysterious breeze go past your face, can't you?<br /><br />This book gives one the sense of a guilty pleasure without giving any reason to feel guilty.

0765350386|5.0|It has been quite awhile for me since I last read a book that I did not want to put down, for fear of not knowing what was going to happen next.  Sanderson's Mistborn book 1 was just that for me.  An awesome fantasy tale with magic, action, great characters, a great storyline, and a great world.  He creates the world vividly and as I read i kept asking myself more and more questions about this world.  Some to be answered later, others, maybe I need to read the final two books to find out!    If you are looking for a great winter read, or maybe you haven't ventured far into fantasy, I would definitely get this book.  I'd sell you my copy but i'll probably read it again after I get the next two.  Sanderson is great at creating a climax in action and also he is adept at pulling together a dull moment to tell part of the story and STILL making in interesting by focusing on the characters plights.  I literally kept looking at things from everyone's point of view in this book.  Great read, great author.

B00005JPTI|4.0|Like most fans of horror literature, I've read the book, I Am Legend by Richard Matheson.  Matheson is (next to Lovecraft) the most important figure in horror in the twentieth century.  This famous book almost created the concept of \\"the last real human left on Earth.\\"  In the book, it is vampires.  In the movies, they became \\"mutants,\\" or zombies, or \\"the infected.\\"      This film gives us monsters who are a cross between vampires and zombies.  They are like vampires because they cannot be exposed to sunlight.  Otherwise, they are like the zombies of the 28 Days Later mold - exceptionally fast and strong.  (I still have a problem with fast, strong zombies - where do they get their strength from, especially considering they are so under-nourished.  But perhaps I am being too literal.)    This movie works because the filmmakers choose to use suspense over cheap shocks.  It is amazing how long it takes to even see one of the monsters.  Most of the film is about Will Smith trying (and failing) to hold onto his sanity as he wonders through the surreally empty Manhattan.    There are flaws in the film to be sure - mostly, some badly done CGI effects.  All in all, it works.  It is about time this film was made.  For years, it has been kicking around Hollywood attached to people like Schwarzenegger and so on.  It was even listed in an Entertainment Weekly article about the \\"best scripts never made.\\"  Now, it has been made.  As a benefit, the book is popular again - and  whole generation of new readers will discover the old master.

B000OCZBS0|5.0|I'm just listening to the first time and I love them. Every song is a surpise. Like one reviewer said, the lead does have a very operatic style but it works so well with the music I can't imagine anything else. They have the heavy metallic beat (and I'm not particularly a fan), suddendly breaking into more of a ska sound, or marachaci, or country rock, or eastern, and yes there's a digaroo, followed by straight progressive. I like Within Temptation, but Diablo Swing Orchestra is more experimental, they throw more into the mix. They remind me more of Symphony X or System of a Down.
B00005JKNC|5.0|The fantastic thing about this movie is that you take Jim Carrey and once he stops trying to be just funny and starts trying to act you find out that he's amazing at it. No one can deny that Jim Carrey has everything it takes to be a fantastic actor. This movie is classic, it takes place in the era of the Red Scare. Jim Carrey is a screenwriter by the name of Peter Appleton who gets blacklisted for some communist group that he attended in college to impress a girl. He goes out that evening and gets drunk and takes a drive. His car goes off a bridge and he hits his head. He wakes up on a beach the next day not remembering a thing. He is taken in to a small town and is mistaken for a WWII hero who was thought to be dead. With the FBI looking for him and the town welcoming their hero home this movie deals with a small town's healing from WWII and the many sons that they lost. It's a fantastic movie recommended for anyone, especially those that consider themselves movie buffs. This is the unknown masterpiece of Jim Carrey's collection.

B0000AFQS0|5.0|This 1979 movie film really put the Who on the map - after it came out everybody was a Who fan - Keith Moon just died a year before and many kids I knew never even heard of the Who even till The Kids Are Alright came out - This led to feverish ticket sales with the 1979 tour a month or two later that eventually developed into the tradgity a the Ohio gig where many kids were killed because time magizine said this might be thier last tour etc.. So in a way this film made the Who even bigger than they were - Many Who fans never saw Kieth Moon play but in this film including myself - I would guess at least two thirds of Who fans never saw Keith live except this film - When kieth played with the band The Who played generally 2000 to 4000 seat venues except for special larger gigs like New Castle England gig which had over 100,000 kids there - and other famous super gigs - They played at the 3000 seat Capital Theater in Washington DC in 1973 during the Quadraphina Tour - it is the example of a smaller 3000 seat venue etc.. - the oval roof cement building is still there next to the DC Union Station yard - The Greatful Dead were the last band to play there in 1973 before it closed down then - the Beatles played thier first gig in America there after the TV show in 1964 after riding down on a train from New York City - The Who did do many big shows with Kieth but more people saw Kenny Jones play with them than any other drummer before or since - every show they did with him sold out in a hour or less - the gigs were at least the Arena size from 1979 to 1982 - I know it sounds stupid now but when Pete - Roger - John and Kenny hit the stage at the spectrum in 1979 the place went crazy with applause and screaming - It was like seeing the Beatles or something - Pete plugged in the Les Paul and made some tune up sounds - people went nuts etc,..  I know it was all because of this film they became superstars to kids that where only like 9 to 12 years old when Who's Next came out -definitely a new Who generation so to speak - so this is a important part of Who history for me - They sold more records than ever after Kieth died and I know this film did that for them - 20 year old kids were yelling out song names to play at the band that were already ten to 6 years old then long after they off the charts - kids would yell at John to play Whisky Man and stuff like that you know he never did it was crazy - So thats what this film means to me and when you see it again or never saw it before you'll see why they went crazy I guess - It is a pretty good Rock film even now a must have for any Hooligan at any age
0393061310|4.0|Good piece of work.  Inspires thought and conversation.  Authoritative? No.  Possible, yes.  Researched extensively.  Good fodder for late night dinner discussions.
B000002P2V|5.0|Great Album - I can still hear Who are You being played next to songs of the Bee Gee's How Deep is your love and other disco type material - This album saved Modern Rock in this period of Radio malaze to me - It was pretty bad after Peter Frampton Comes Alive disappeared off the charts - 1977 was half bad and half good - Disco raged like wild fire and almost burned up the Real Rockers alive - So Who Are You was a welcome addition of good Rock to the record stores to me in late 1978 - Over all a good record - There are clips of them in the studio making this record in the Kids are Alright film - I guess when you think of it the record business always had a high turn over of new artist and songs so this is a snap shot of the Who in Disco Fever Inferno - It was Hell - All that Cocaine Pomp and Millions of Dallors being made on music and Artists now in the trash bin - This alblum still holds up despite all that So buy it you won't be sorry - Who Are You Who Who Who Who I really want ot know

B00006ZCFH|3.0|Erykah Badu first entered the music industry in 1997 with a fresh, jazzy neo-soul sound that instantly brought critical acclaim and even comparisons to all-time greats, such as Billie Holiday and Chaka Khan. Her superb debut album, Baduizm, won her two Grammy Awards, and was soon certified triple-platinum by the RIAA. Badu's raw, soulful, and introspective sophomore album, Mama's Gun, was equally praised, and most modern R&B fans would agree that it is a classic. Three years later came this so-called EP--which proves to be both a disclaimer and misnomer for this fifty-minute collection of ten songs--Worldwide Underground.    A misnomer because EPs are not usually meant to be more than twenty-five minutes in length, a disclaimer because this experimental rough sketch is not meant to be the predecessor of Mama's Gun. This, of course, disappointed many of Erykah's fans, who had been waiting patiently for a rightful third album from the quirky singer. However, if listened to with a free mind and no expectations, Worldwide is not the huge disappointment it's been made out to be.    The addictive \\"Danger,\\" in my honest opinion, is one of the best songs Badu has crafted in her entire career. Telling the tale of a drug dealer's ride-or-die girlfriend with a guilty conscience, the track serves as an upbeat and energetic sequel to her earlier hit single, \\"Otherside of the Game.\\" Over deep, thumping bass and sharp horns, Erykah plays the part with extreme skill and style. The hook-heavy, six-minute ride through the dark city never gets old to me. \\"I Want You,\\" about a strong (and distracting) longing for a lover, is quite a long track, clocking in at almost eleven minutes. But it still never fails to fascinate me with each and every listen. Beginning with a sparse and slow heartbeat, the track continues to accelerate in tempo and passion until a cool breakdown with soulful background vocals. It then begins to slow from there on, soon leading Ms. Badu's vocals to sound like they were chopped and screwed like some Southern hip-hop. It then cuts into a killer electric guitar solo from Lenny Kravitz. Finally it fades out, with Erykah singing, \\"first of all/ when I tell you I love you/ don't mean I do,\\" making the whole song a bit of a mystery to me. Was she simply infatuated, but not in love? \\"Love of My Life Worldwide,\\" a semi-remake of The Sequence's late `70s hit \\"Funk You Up,\\" is probably the most fun and accessible one of the bunch. Erykah, who originally began as an emcee named Apples at the tender age of fourteen, shows her skills on the mic. Queen Latifah, who has been out of the rap game for quite a while, stops by to party. Angie Stone, one third of The Sequence, puts her stamp of approval on the track and Bahamadia also shows up. The song is like a big ol' celebration on wax. The spontaneous collaboration was a great choice for the last full song on the album.    As excellent as some of the EP is, the album is equally flawed. The \\"World Keeps Turning\\" intro and outro really weren't necessary, and are just ways to take up space, if anything. \\"Woo,\\" which was apparently created to replicate one of her stage-show experiments, falls terribly flat. \\"The Grind\\" is pretty jumbled and confusing, too. \\"Bump It\\" is pretty enjoyable, but I don't think all the improvising at the end of the song was necessary, even though I do love Zap Mama. \\"Think Twice\\" would've been one of my favorite tracks if it weren't cut short and rushed for no reason at all. It's like she was giving an intimate performance in a jazz club, and then she had to bring it to an abrupt stop after a fire started and the audience had to evacuate the building. I can take or leave the sing-songy \\"Back In The Day (Puff),\\" where Erykah reminisces on her childhood.    The bottom line: The rough-around-the-edges and experimental Worldwide Underground is neither an EP nor a proper follow-up to the excellent Mama's Gun. Even at a short ten tracks, it has some filler and minor missteps; however, it still contains a few stellar tracks that make it worthwhile and a pretty enjoyable listen.      Key tracks: I Want You, Danger, Love of My Life Worldwide.

Now onto this version on HDDVD.  If you havent seen the movie it's a fun christmas story that our kids love.  THe image quality of this HDDVD version is far superior that than the standard version.  The image is sharp, the colors have lots of pop and the audio is spectacular.  Turn up the bass and listen to the train ROAR.  you'll swear the train pulled up just outside your house.
B000MRAAJW|2.0|I have not yet watched my DVD set but have heard wonderful things about it. People should know that in order to watch the HD DVD set they need to own a HD DVD Player.  I am sure that there are people that know this, whom are really Technology savy, but there are many of us who do not.  Since there was no info addressing this on the add, I bought it thinking it could play on my regular DVD player and that I could watch it on my HD flat screen.  As a result I had to return it and buy the regular DVD set.  Also, the first disc is a blue rray disc.  Make sure to find out if that first disc can play on an HDS DVD player, or if you need a DVD Player that is both HD & blue ray.

B000OONTFU|5.0|Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Ultimate Matrix Collection HD is. You have to see it for yourself.     To paraphrase Morpheus is the only way I could honestly began any review of this brilliant collection. The picture quality is absolutely stunning! The blacks are jet black, the sickly greenish hue of the Matrix is perfectly pronounced but not overwhelming. The DETAIL is insane! Every detail appears as if your looking out of a window rather than looking at TV ...this is easily one of the best looking HDs I have seen( and believe me I have looked at a number of good HD transfers)!     For content freaks like me , I found the sheer volume of special features overwhelming! The \\"in movie experience\\" pip commentaries ( on all 3 movies ) is very cool and a must see feature. The documentarys on the flip sides were all very cool and enjoyable in their presentation ; I have heard some reviewers complain about some of the non movie features being regular dvd and not HD but I honestly could not care less.    Bottom line : If you own a HD player and have even a passing interest in the Matrix you MUST buy this set! It represents WHY HD is the format of choice for serious movie enthusiast.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Amazon reviews, the editorials, sometimes amaze me; What person is going to have a \\"Gag Reflex\\" after seeing animated rats?  This is an artfully done film, created in the Disney-esque tradition of making animals so lovable and anthropomorphic.The basic premise of the Rat who had culinary  ambitions is the leaping off point for many laughs and a great joy ride.  The DVD is well done, except that the extras that relate to the film somehow do not.The one extra you will laughing LOTS at is \\"LIFTED\\", this is a very good addition, and well worth the words of an extra.The material stated as extra which more closely relates to the film is   essentially a waste of time, and not worth a look out, certainly not entertaining like the feature and the extra LIFTED.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|An excellant heartwarming classic that is given a new breath of life now that it is presented in colour. I thought the colour would seem artificial and spoil the spirit of this film, but thankfully i was wrong.

Pass it on....and on to your children. GOD BLESS THE WORLD...
B000UJBYD8|5.0|With a return to the basic sound of their earlier stuff, on Born Into This one of my favorite bands returns to show me why I liked them so much in the first place.         When you get this CD, be prepared to fall into the trap of listening only to the main CD, and sort of pushing the bonus CD to the side.  If you do that too long however, you run the risk of not being able to enjoy some of their best work on this CD.           Generally, without getting into all the pompous-sounding verbiage of a professional review, This CD sounds much like a return to the days of Rain and Electric, but with the maturity of the musicians quite evident.  Ian's voice has lost nothing on the CD, and if you get a chance to catch a live show, I definitely recommend it.  They are very good performers and musicians.         Standout tracks on the CD to me, personally, are Stand Alone,Savages - the full length version on the bonus CD, Sound of Destruction and I ... Asassin.          Dirty Little Rock Star is getting serious airplay, and live it's a great party tune at the shows.  Hopefully, this CD will generate interest in the new generation in some of the older Cult catalog.
0525950079|5.0|[[ASIN:0525950079 World Without End]]<br />Pillars of the Earth was one of my favorite stories of all time. I didn't realize a sequel was being written, but I am so glad I found it, and read it. The characters are easy to relate to, and their lives are so well described, you feel you know them. It helped me to understand how soft and easy we have things today, and how arbitrary life's fortunes were in the 1300's. I've enjoyed all of Mr. Follett's efforts, but Pillars and World are my absolute favorites.
0374105235|5.0|This is a story, amazing in it's simplicity in the telling of a most extroidinary life experience.  It gave me insight to a world unknown to most of us.  It reminded me that while we here in the United States of America live out our everyday and ordinary lives, others are forced to live under terrible circumstances for no other reason than to have been born in the wrong place at the wrong time.  It has reminded me how lucky I and my children really are.  Thank you, Mr. Beah
B000VNMMQQ|5.0|I still am debating with myself, which was the best Die Hard?  It's between the first one, and this one.  While the first one is classic, this new one has really brought the Die Hard series into the modern day times.  If you're afraid that they were trying to revive a dead series, and that this film would just seem like throwing a well-known title character into a crappy, \\"we just want to be in the here-and-now\\" film, don't worry - this film does not do that.  I believe that this scenario is right up John McClane's alley, and Bruce Willis meets the bar quite nicely in this role.  The addition of Justin Long as a...side-kick (?), if you will...helps make this movie what it is: great.  The dialogue between the two (whether serious or joking) is fantastic.  Great movie.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|Every week i read that other countries are always trying to hack in our<br />systems...why not...by electronically controlling a country you can bring<br />it down to its knees pretty fast..  So it makes this movie even more<br />interesting because its all deals with that specific scenario.<br />Bruce still has it...is interesting and moves the movie pretty good.<br />Bottom line....great for a movie night.
B0000062FL|5.0|I have always loved Santana's earlier work.  I'm purchasing this in CD because I want to have it forever.  Those who rate this album negatively probably weren't even alive when Santana recorded it.   Ignore the negatives.  This is one that shouldn't be missed!
B000V86OKG|5.0|I also tell everyone I know WATCH DEXTER.  Michael C. Hall is EXCELLENT as Dexter Morgan, and I am Dexter's number one fan.  The ultimate antihero, the plot twists and fascinates. My husband and I are addicted, 100 percent.  Best series on TV. Please buy and watch the first season, then follow it up with season two. Season Two blew us away. Great stuff. Just great. I bought the first season for my sister, and I will buy season two for her as soon as it is available.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Yes, I mean it. You MUST see this film. Especially during an election year where health care is such an important reason to vote. We are so lacking in the care of ourselves that the rest of the world just shakes their collective heads in wonder. This film shows us simply how bad it is; my hope is that it will change a few minds.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|This CD is an audio treat. If the songs, instrumentation and the voices of these women don't bring chills to your spine then you are probably dead. When PBS brought these wonderful and harmonic voices together they could not have made a better match. I can barely wait for their next CD release. Hear it and believe. I do wish that there were more songs in Gaelic but I still give it five stars plus.
B000W4KT64|5.0|I didn't think I'd be interested in this movie but I ended up absoutely loving it. I've never seen the play so it was completely new to me. I loved the music and the humor. This is a movie that will put you in a good mood for sure. All the lead characters were great but for me, it was the supporting characters that really made this a great movie. James Marsden, Amanda Bynes, Michelle Pfeiffer, and others were all great! I did feel though that John Travolta was miscast. He doesn't have a good singing voice and he seemed to be trying to be Mike Myers. If they're going to have a male for the role, I think Myers would have be perfect for it. But Travolta was still good.
0375714839|5.0|I liked it more than the film, because it had a greater sense of humor
B000I9YX06|5.0|\\"I Robot\\" is a great science fiction movie.  The plot is akin to the terminator series, where humans create robots, which then try to destroy the humans.  I was hesitent to rent it, because it was so long (2+ hours).  However, the plot moved fast the entire time.  It's interesting, it's action packed, and the acting with Will Smith and Bridget M. works for me.  Recommend without hesitation.
B000XFVIMQ|2.0|There is an encoding error made by Warners on this version of T3 as it has been encoded in 1080i not 1080p as per the box description and the HD DVD version.   Warners may do an exchange later but at this stage this is the version to be released and there will be no recall....  It might be better to wait for the fixed version if Warners do one.  The film was a major suck anyway compared to the first 2.

B00005JPTI|4.0|The story begins with one of humanity's greatest hopes seemingly fulfilled. Dr. Alice Krippen (Emma Thompson) has discovered the cure for cancer. This cure is a virus that is a subset of measles. Paraphrasing her words: the virus is a fast car.  Measles is like putting a criminal at the wheel.  What she did was \\"replace that criminal with a cop.\\"     At the time of the announcement, clinical trials had taken place with 10,900 subjects.  All were cancer-free.  Something clearly went very wrong between the clinical trials and the introduction of Krippen Virus (KV) into the population.     At the time KV was introduced into the population, there were 6 billion people on earth. The virus killed 90% of those. The remaining 9% became rabid and photophobic, running in hives only at night and killing whatever they came in contact with.     Dr. Robert Neville is one of the 1% of the population immune to KV--and survived. At onset, he was a US Army Colonel and virologist living in New York City.      Even three years later, Neville hasn't given up.  He takes his motto from his hero, Bob Marley:    \\"The people, who were trying to make this world worse... are not taking a day off. How can I? Light up the darkness.\\"     By day, he and his faithful dog, Sam, travel the city looking for other survivors.  He daily broadcasts a message over all AM frequencies, asking anyone alive and uninfected to come to the South Street Seaport at mid-day offering to provide food, shelter and safety.     By night, he hides in his heavily fortified home, preparing food and urging Sam to \\"eat your vegetables.\\" He watches one movie per night, which he takes from a nearby video store--apparently viewing in alphabetical order.  He's now up to \\"G\\". In his basement, he's gathered a fully equipped medical laboratory and he's still working on a cure.  He still has hope, although his psyche is beginning to show cracks.     Through flashbacks, we see Neville evacuating his wife and daughter from the city andthe frantic efforts to prevent the spread of the disease.     Probably the best aspect of this film is Will Smith. He does an impressive job of playing a physician keeping lone vigil over the city that was his charge--and holding on to his own waning hope and sanity. Sam the dog is the only character who can upstage him.     I also loved the tributes to Bob Marley.   Like Anna (Alice Braga) in the film, so many of our current generation don't know the man's music or his story.  I'm glad to see both revisited in a popular format. And yes--I agree--Marley was one of the greatest musicians ever.      What I found impossible to believe was the 'science.' Inconceivable that 10,900 people in the initial clinical trials showed no signs of the rabid KV virus?  Further, if the virus is also contagious to animals, wouldn't the rabidity, etc. have shown up in the animal testing which occurs prior to the human. I realize a good part of movie viewing is the 'suspension of disbelief' but I not only had to 'suspend,' I had to kick everything I know about the drug discovery process right out of my head. I honestly believe they could have come up with something far more plausible than this backstory.      There are some warnings here:    1.  While the movie ends with hope, you're going to be going through a lot of depressing material to get there.  Don't go if you're looking for a holiday escape 'pick me up film.'  This isn't it.   2.  If you are intolerant of suspense, reconsider going.  My husband had to leave the theatre because he just couldn't handle parts of the film.   3.  If scientific accuracy is your bag, you are going to hate this film for the reason I stated above (and more).   4.  If you are a devotee of the original Richard Matheson book, you may well disapprove of the redux.      All that being said, I still enjoyed much of the film. \\"I am Legend\\" will be a one-time view for me, but still worth the distraction on a quiet Christmas Eve morning.
1594489505|5.0|The book came a day or so early which is always, in great condition.  I have now read both books from this author and in my opinion he is one of the best contemporary writers of today.  I have recommended this book to many, many people.  Some of it is hard to read because it is happening as we read.  An A list book.
B000JRYOPG|5.0|This was a tuff movie. I enjoyed this movie and I thought that it was well worth the wait for the original version even after watching the movie several times before. It was also cool that the movie included subtitles in English for viewers who do not understand or speak Patois. This movie will probably not be rated as high as \\"The Harder They Come,\\" but it should be ranked as one of the top Jamaican rude boy films of all time as well as the coming out of artists such as Assassin, Spragga Benz, Kymani Marley, Louie Ranking, who were either already established stars or were on their way to stardom. Finally, this movie would not have been as great if it did not feature the great Louie Ranking himself. He showed that in the shottas world, there are nuff bad man; but also, to every bad man, there are nuff badda man. Man ah man ah bad man......
B00005JKJA|4.0|David Lynch's film is a compelling, disturbing hallucination.  An aspiring actress (Naomi Watts) becomes involved with a beautiful amnesiac (Laura Harring) and together they try to piece together the mystery of her identity.  Or something like that.  This film is really impossible to summarize.  The analyses by Randal Robinson and Steve Klemow on this page postulating that the first part of the film is a dream leading to an act of suicide fits in with my impressions of the film, though I have not thought it out in such detail.  I'm going to have to watch this one again someday.
0790733226|1.0|So the best earthly specimen, the planet over, that could possibly be fielded, which all nations would just swoon to agree to, would be some poorly set up super-genius, though quite humble Ph.D. super-astrophysicist, or whatever background she's suppose to have, which she prodigiously got when she was just starting to get her period. UNBELIEVABLY STUPID AND UNREALISTIC.  And then James Woods as head of a crack super-commando, sub-machine equipped, NSA firesquad team, who, when push comes to shove and tensions get hot, supposedly with something so momentous, and uncertain, as alien contact, gives ground and allows Miss Youthful Supergenius to command his team and the entire operation?!?!  If 1 said this were a poorly cast & directed propaganda piece with egregiously affected and phony performances, that would be a step up for it.

0790731509|5.0|ESSENTIAL MOVIE!!! One of the defining roles in Paul Newman's career in which he plays a likable convict put in prison for breaking into parking meters. Luke is a nonconformist which doesn't bode well for him in prison, a place that demands conformity to the rules. Luke evolves into a position of respect among the inmates, they look upon him as a leader though it's a role he doesn't want. He's constantly bucking the system which keeps him in trouble with the warden & guards. Things get worse after a successful escape & subsequent recapture. The warden & guards try to break Luke's spirit which they aren't very successful at. Luke finally tries another escape which leads to his demise.    The movie has several defining moments in it; there's the egg eating scene where Luke eats fifty boiled eggs in one hour, there's the scene where the warden (Strother Martin) makes his famous speech: \\"What we have here... is a failure to communicate...\\" & the scene where, apparently, Luke's spirit is broken. The acting in this movie is outstanding elicited by the director Stuart Rosenberg who wasn't & never will be one of Hollywood's better known directors.    There are many now famous actors in this movie with varying degrees of substantial roles. George Kennedy won  a very deserving Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his role. Also in the movie are Morgan Woodward (Sunglasses) in  a featured yet non-speaking role, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, J.D. Cannon, Lou Antonio, Wayne Rogers (co-star in M*A*S*H), Ralph Waite (The Waltons) & Anthony Zerbe.    Do yourself a favor & get this movie, one of the best \\"prison\\" movies ever done by Hollywood!
1598875329|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Jonathan Winters all of my life.  What is surprising in this CD is that Winters remains faithful to Dicken's text.  I had fully expected him to get carried away and go off on his fantastic tangents like he usually does with his own characters like Maudy Frickert or Elwood P Suggins.  He doesn't.  So, for those looking for a wild and crazy version of A Christmas Carol you COULD be disapointed.  However, as a dedicated Winters fan, I enjoy this recording.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is awe inspiring.  I was impressed by the depth of work and research and by the photography and narration.  But most especially, I was humbled by the creativity, beauty, and grace that is ours to steward from the hand of the Creator God.

0763631205|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for myself so that I could enjoy this timeless Christmas tale over the holidays. This edition of A Christmas Carol was a wonderful purchase.

I would highly recommend this book to young and old alike.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah Carey's fall from grace was, for a time, one of the most widely publicized downfalls of a celebrity. She faced subsequent failures of her first venture into acting, Glitter, as well as with the soundtrack and her following album, Charmbracelet. This was the album that spawned rumours that Mariah had lost her once incredible vocal ability, due to the whispery and somewhat strained sound of her voice on nearly all the tracks. After her recovery, Mariah sought to prove to her detractors that she was still on top of her game, and her voice as powerful as ever. As a result, we received this; her highly acclaimed, \\"return of the voice\\" comeback album.    Lead single \\"It's Like That\\" is a catchy, happier kind of track that hints at Mariah's continuing vocal power, since she bypasses the whispery style in favour of singing in her full voice. Some have written this off as a mere attempt to appeal to the younger crowd, but it must nevertheless be said that it brought Mariah back into the public's attention. \\"We Belong Together\\", while in its prime, was a massive hit that bordered heavily on overexposed. This is truly Mariah's return to form. It is similar stylistically to Mariah's classic ballads, featuring powerful vocals and well-written lyrics. This has potential to stand among Mariah's classics, due to its style as well as its popularity. \\"Shake It Off\\" was more of a grower, although it is a fan favourite. It initially appears to be a typical mid-tempo, but Mariah's vocals really sold it for me. It's not my favourite, but it's enjoyable as a whole. \\"Mine Again\\" has more of an old-school feel, with quiet instrumentation that is practically masked by Mariah's powerful vocals. This song alone would prove to her critics that at least vocally, Mariah is back on top form. It is very reminiscent of her earlier material, which is definitely a good thing.     \\"Say Something\\", assisted by Snoop Dogg, can't really hold a candle to their earlier collaboration on her Rainbow album, but makes a decent listen nonetheless. I really like Snoop's rap, although Mariah's parts are fairly average and repetitive. The Kanye West produced \\"Stay the Night\\" was another grower. It is another track that showcases Mariah's vocal prowess, but suffers from a rather weak chorus. (\\"It's cold outside/and much too late to drive\\"). However, the vocals for the most part make up for the uncharacteristically weak lyricism. \\"Get Your Number\\" caused some rather pointless confusion about its guest star, since Jermaine Dupri sounded remarkably similar to Nelly. Aside from that, it is a catchy track which is a prime example of how vocals and production can save a song in spite of weak lyrics. The second verse fares quite a bit better, but it is ultimately the vocal arrangements that make the song. \\"One and Only\\" was one of the better tracks to feature a guest star, although the first half fares much better than the second. The lyrics to the second verse are weak, and Mariah's quick and whispery delivery does not suit the track at all. Twista's verse seems a little slowed down compared to anything else I've heard from him, and makes a great contribution to the track.     \\"Circles\\" highlights both Mariah's vocal and songwriting abilities at their best. This is another track reminiscent of classic Mariah, giving a very passionate and sincere performance. Here again, Mariah proves that she doesn't need guest rappers and dumbed-down lyrics to have appeal. \\"Your Girl\\" is easily one of the weakest tracks, that is thankfully quite short (under three minutes). It's not that the song is bad per se, but the vocal arrangement could have been much better. The chorus seems to be yelled (as in chanted, not belted) at the listener, and comes across as rather obnoxious. \\"I Wish You Knew\\", in contrast, proves itself to be a highlight. Like \\"Circles\\", this song was written Mariah and James Wright, a pairing that produced three of the best tracks on the album. Mariah's vocals are more controlled here, and the lyrics are some of the strongest. The track was given a live sort of feel, complete with an applause track (which surprisingly fit well, without appearing self-congratulatory). This is a definite highlight.     \\"To the Floor\\" with Nelly is a decent track overall, but suffers slightly from a weak hook. Nelly's actually a decent singer, which really surprised me since his rapping isn't all that great. Had the hook been even slightly stronger, this would have been a really good song, although as is it fares pretty well. \\"Joy Ride\\" has a sort of atmospheric feel although it may seem a little droning. There's no denying that it is a beautiful song, and showcases Mariah's vocals at their best, it remains somewhat unmemorable to me when compared with many of the other slower tracks featured here. \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" is the final track written by Mariah and James Wright, and is a jazzy, gospel-influenced closer. Normally I'm not a huge fan of Gospel music, but this one really works. Complete with choir and inspirational lyrics, this is a great track that ends the album on a high note.     Overall Mark: 4/5    Contrary to popular belief, this is far from a perfect comeback album. Mariah still seems to be under the impression that she needs to drop brand-names and use rappers in her songs to gain credibility and appeal to a younger crowd. In fact, the album's best tracks are those that allow both her voice and her songwriting to shine, namely the ballads which use minimal production. It's not that the hip-hop songs are terrible, it's just that at Mariah's age and with all she's accomplished/experienced, we should and often do expect more. It's fine to want to crossover and gain more fans, but the way Mariah goes about it tends to alienate those she already has. The biggest problem with this album is that, apart from several of the ballads, the lyrics are on the weak side. We have seen with her previous work that Mariah is a very capable songwriter, so there really isn't much excuse for lyrics at this level. For all its flaws, however, the album is a solid (if overrated) effort.

B000YENUIG|4.0|At the end of this fascinating story, just before the finish, there is a huge jump in the story. The character jumps from B to E. You wonder how did he get here? If only the director had shared with us some of the detail. It's as if we flipped to the last page of the book. It's good, but could have been better.
B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|The Bourne Ultimatum is a great movie that I appreciate now more than I did in theaters.  I guess you have to watch some movies more than once!!!  The movie is exhilarating and exciting. I've found that this installment has outdone its predecessor. As usual Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne flawlessly. You feel every bit of emotion and intesity done not only by the actors/actresses, but by the camerawork itself; especialy as Jason Bourne paces through crowds as he attempts to protect a newspaper reporter.  The level of realism involved is just insane.    Bourne Ultimatum is also a well thought out HD DVD.  The sheer about of extras is incredible.  With the Bourne Ultimatum you definitely get your money's worth.  It has 3 set of U-control features such as the Blackbrier Files the VW cam and Picture In Picture; all of which can be used independantly, all together or in different combinations.  The picture quality is 9 and the audio is a 10.  I was 110% satisifed with my purchase and highly recommend it to anyone looking for pure pulse-pounding adrenaline in a movie!

B00005JPNW|2.0|I was greatly disappointed with this film after hearing how wonderful the books were.  It was boringly long and the characters lacked any depth especially the various children and the little girl who has the power to be able to ascertain the truth through the compass.    The one interesting thing about the movie is that everyone has their own personal daemon that looks like an animal.  The daemon is able to change at will between different types of animals until its host attains adulthood and then the daemon becomes its permanent form.    The witches are not really clear as to who they are and just seem to appear to save the day out of nowhere.  The bear warrior (a poor imitation of the Lion from The Chronicles of Narnia) has virtually no personality and the director tries to force the audience to feel for him (perhaps this is expanded in the book?).      Daniel Craig has virtually no personality and is totally ungrateful when the girl saves him from poisoning.  Though Nicolle Kidman looks a wickedly beautiful as always, her character also is lacking.    I was bored to tears for more than two hours and lo and behold, the story doesn't finish but like The Empire Strikes Back (where you wonder how Han Solo will be rescued) the story is to be continued in a future film.  For more there is not enough suspense at the end for me to care what happens next.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|Well, you knew it had to peak with Hey, Jude and Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, and it does, on the rooftops of New York with romance to spare among the water storage tanks required by city code.  It's sappy, but it works, not least because it's been an entertaining ride getting there with two sympathetic and scrappy lovers.  The closest ancestor of Across the Universe is Moulin Rouge, a movie I found just annoying.  Not so with Universe -- most of the Beatles songs are performed adequately or more, and some, e.g. Dear Prudence, Revolution, and She Came in through the Bathroom Window, mesh nicely with the loose plot.  It's not the least about the Beatles, but is loosely about the 60's as seen through some of the Beatles' songs.  Call it the 60's that nobody and everybody lived.  Many of the sequences are drenched in color, and a few are over-choreographed, to simulate -- perhaps -- the distortion of color and time when high. But most of Across the Universe is a rush, and the dancing, when not over long, is high energy and imaginative. In the end, the movie may be like the 60's themselves, a great run, a little silly, and not quite as world turning as some of the participants may have wished or believed.
0307387151|1.0|Having heard that Atonement was a 'masterpiece' it is possible that I went in with expectations which were too high. Also, I'd recently read Jo Walton's Farthing which I can absolutely qualify as a masterpiece - engaging, chilling, compelling - and Atonement didn't compare at all favorably.<br /><br />It's a meandering tale which, by my lights, suffers from having the major plot point captured in the summary. You know Briony makes a terrible error in judgment and the book belabors it over, and over, and over. The 'twist' at the end was the only point at which the novel 'grabbed' me and by then it was too little, too late.<br /><br />I expect the novel will make a great film because you can hack out enormous chunks of it and not miss a thing.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|If you haven't cared for Wes Anderson movies in the past, THE DARJEELING LIMITED will probably not help you get over that hurdle. In my opinion, his flat-out funniest film is still THE ROYAL TENNANBAUMS...but if you don't like that, it's hard to imagine you would like DARJEELING.     On the other hand, if you're a fan of the quirky, dead-pan, drier than dust humor, coupled with unorthodox camera work (a motionless camera, or a camera that moves side to side but seldom in and out) and fanciful art direction, DARJEELING should be your cup of tea (pun intended).     Three estranged brothers, each carrying a load of psychic baggage, come together on a ramshackle train in India to go our a \\"journey of spiritual growth.\\" This journey has been arranged by the oldest brother, Owen Wilson. He tells them that he wants them to bond and grow close again. And in a way, this is true...but it also appears he wants them to help each other come to terms with the grief over their father's death (although he may not even realize this is a goal) and he has one other destination in mind that is a big secret (which I'll try not to spoil here.)     Middle brother is Adrien Brody, who is expecting to become a father any day now, but hasn't even bothered to tell his wife that he's going on this trip. His grief over the loss of his father is mostly obviously displayed, because he is wearing this father's glasses, even though the prescription probably isn't right for him.     The youngest brother is Jason Schwartzman, who is grappling with a prolong breakup with his girlfriend (played by Natalie Portman in a little movie called HOTEL CHEVALIER which is now thankfully being played as part of this film's theatrical release. I can't imagine enjoying DARJEELING properly without having seen it). Schwartzman is also a writer, and he has brought with him a handwritten draft of a new short story which obviously has resonance for his brothers.     These three are oddballs, to say the least. They really don't belong in India, and really struggle to get along with each other. They are classic Anderson characters, removed from their emotions, full of verbal and physical quirks and tics, supremely intelligent and hugely sad.     At the beginning of the film, Bill Murray makes a brief cameo appearance. Is there any actor better at being funny with so much sadness working today? In LOST IN TRANSLATION, his character, while witty, was burdened with sadness. In Anderson's much maligned THE LIFE AQUATIC, Murray is nearly crippled with his sadness. Murray has brought this to an art form not really seen since perhaps the time of Chaplin. So his early appearance in DARJEELING almost helps to set that mood of sadness that permeates virtually every moment of the film. But this does not make it oppressive. The beautiful country of India, the colorful settings (the train itself is a marvel of design) and the off-the-wall incidents that occur keep the audience happily engaged.     What I like about Anderson's characters is that they generally do not carry anger. So often in films, characters who are grieving or holding in some other emotion will frequently burst out in anger or violence. It's become an easy cliché. However, Anderson's characters are sad. They tamp down on that sadness, and when it does bubble up, it's seldom a physical explosion, but more of a collapse. They are touchingly simple moments, usually. Because the characters have spent most of the movie squashing their feelings, when they DO come up, it is all the more effective for the viewer. There are moments in DARJEELING of simple, touching sadness...and they are very effective.     So yes, this is not a happy movie. I think in many ways, people are turned off by the films because they are expecting a quirky but harmless comedy. However, in ROYAL TENNANBAUMS, Ben Stiller has a scene of such startling sadness and pain that it is almost too much for the viewer. In LIFE ACQUATIC, Murray's character suffers a verypainful loss near the end of the film, taking the viewer into an area that they probably didn't want to go. And DARJEELING has a couple of moments that are totally unexpected, including a scene when the brothers are kicked off the train for bad behavior and wander into a rural village just in time to plunge into some earth-shattering events. I know some viewers and some critics find the change in tone shocking and unwelcome. For me, it was a powerful moment...and a poignant one. Also, a vivid reminder that just because a movie (or life) appears to be going in one direction...don't be surprised if it takes a different turn.     All three leads are terrific. It's particularly nice to see Wilson back in form...reminding us that he is capable of something other than the complete goofball he can play in his sleep. Angelica Huston has a small, but critical role and she is very good too.     Also, I have to mention the terrific soundtrack. The three obscure songs from The Kinks are highlights for me, and turned the album into a must have! I never dreamed that \\"Powerman\\" would ever be used in a film...but it's brilliant.     As I wrote this review, I realized that I was going to have to see the movie again this weekend. I can't wait for the DVD release. To me, it was that good. But again, if you don't like Anderson films, you probably won't like this one either (although, I can keep my fingers crossed that you may try anyway...and end up impressed.)

0582435676|3.0|THE BEACH is a solid debut by young author Alex Garland.  In many ways, this is an updated version of LORD OF THE FLIES, set in Thailand in the mid-1990s.  This book is smoothly written, easy to read, and quite suspenseful toward the end.<br /><br />In my opinion, the storyline of this novel was somewhat underdeveloped.  A lot of different things happen in THE BEACH, but they don't fit together as well as I would have liked.  The middle of this book really isn't very compelling -- it just focuses on daily life in the beach paradise, and the social politics between the beach's inhabitants.  I also found the ending both anti-climactic and predictable, a real disappointment.<br /><br />I also didn't find many of the characters that interesting, especially the narrator.  Most of them are slackers, allegedly typical of the members of Generation X.  In the end, I found most of these kids to be superficial and boring.  The narrator is particularly annoying -- he suffers a series of hallucinations in this novel that are silly and distract from the hard realities of the story.<br /><br />In short, THE BEACH was a decent yarn, and author Garland undoubtedly has an engaging writing style.  But I wouldn't compare this book to great literary debuts like THE SECRET HISTORY.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|[[ASIN:B000ZLFALI Across the Universe (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br /><br />I went to see this after a couple of weeks of prompting from my movie buddy on the other side of the country.<br /><br />I like Beatles music but really went in to this thinking it would be OK but really not expecting to be blown away as I was.<br /><br />Dana Fuchs is marvelous as the character that is a tribute to Janis Joplin.  Her partner Martin Luther McCoy is \\"cool\\" from the moment you see him.<br /><br />Evan Rachel Wood is little girl sexy as Lucy.<br /><br />The cameos surprised me and you really need to see Salma Hayek in the sequence with Happiness is a Warm Gun.  If you don't understand the song NOW you will after seeing that.<br /><br />I really liked Eddie Izzard as Mr. Kite.  For me he WAS Mr. Kite.  At least as filtered through John Lennon's  mind.

B000WC3AGM|1.0|I bought this item for my wife for Christmas.  it took Amazon 10 days to send the item out.  It made it just in time, on 12-24-07, which is cutting it a little too close considering I ordered it back on 12-10-07.  that said, Amazon sent me this item banged up.  It was bubble-wrapped, but the box had dents and dings all over it.  It appeared to have been dropped several times, and clearly, was not inspected by Amazon prior to sending.  If the video works, I'll probably just keep the product, because it's too much of a hassle to mail back. But how embarrassed I'll be tommorow morning on Christmas, when my wife opens the box and finds a beat up gift, courtesy of Amazon.      Amazon, your standards have seriously declined.  Thanks for taking 10 days to fill this order, and thanks for mailing me a dinged up product, one day before christmas.

B000VWYJ86|1.0|I disliked this film intensely enought to make me reassess whether I was under drugs of some sort for having thought the first two in this series were decent--though I have no interest now in going back and watching the first two again to see what it was that I had liked about them....The action here is ALL there is...it just runs from one chase scene to the next with little story or reasoning behind the action.  The action itself??  Well the cuts are so quick and the fake punching sounds so bad that you could care less...and lets discus the cuts...The editing in this film is SOOOOO poor I could not believe it....its one thing to have a quick pace in a modern film but this was ridiculous...you don't get more than about a 1/2 a second view of ANYTHING in this film--likely because the director/editor knows the viewer could care less about the characters or locations...I don't know what happened to Greengrass...I loved Flight 93 but this is a weak effort...Damon and other actors??  Who knows how they performed in this film as you can't tell given what little time the camera is allowed to linger on them...I will never again watch a \\"Bourne\\" film of any kind...it was that bad...

0140120416|5.0|Real systematic, very detailed, and leaves no blind spots in your knowledge of russian... I'm not a native english-speaker, but it is perfectly understandable. Only the useful words are in the vocabulary, no childish \\"red-car, blue-car\\" stuff, just the crucial ones that you need if you go abroad. Besides it provides good exercises at the end of the lessons, and every 5 lessons (of 30) it reviews your knowledge of the past lessons. Okay some could say, there's no audio material, but I think the writer has done a good a job of explaining pronunciation. Recommended for everyone!
B00005JPLW|4.0|This is a great movie.  Love the action scenes and there are some great one-liners.    Realistic, No.  Fun to watch, ABSOLUTELY.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|The husband and I got this movie, he wasn't very excited about it, but when it ended he clapped - yes, while we watched it at home. Great for a tween boy or girl, not too much violence, no nudity, or strong language.. a well done piece that we will treasure forever!!
B00005JKGZ|4.0|I absolutely cannot handle Margaret O'Brien.  I like O'Brien in her other films but its her character here that keeps me from giving this movie 5 stars.  Her character is a brat, snivelling and annoying.  Her talking through her stopped up nose makes me want to take her over my knee and spank her.  The Halloween Sequence bogs the movie down and goes on too long.  Now, the good stuff:  Judy Garland is absolutely beautiful and the songs are first-rate, as well as the production values.  Marjorie Main as the maid is funny and steals the show as she usually does.  Mary Astor as the mother, Lucille Bremer as the older sister and Joan Carroll (a very pretty little girl who would go on to a greater role the following year in \\"Bells of St. Mary's\\") are great as well.  The technicolor leaps out at you and that alone makes a beautiful film.  Minnelli's direction is outstanding as well.

B000WZAE1I|3.0|Witches: check. Cool flying ship: check. Great actors: check. Great FX: check. Great script: .....uh, guys?<br />What could have been a great film just seems to be lacking something, a certain spark of creativity and at times it seems plot elements are thrown into the film SOLELY for the point of being different or strange. Why did the captain wear dresses? Sure he was really a softy, but then he parades around in drag? Just seemed like it was tossed in there for the point of seeing De Niro in drag, no other reason.<br />When our hero finally has to take a stand and face the evil witch to save his love, he looks about as sure of himself as a rat being dropped in a vat of boiling ooze. I was not convinced he was the hero he was supposed to be.<br />Just seemed lost, without a tight story, and a wandering pace that just needed a spark of creative genius to make this so-so film into a great film. Also most attempts at humor seemed to fall flat for me, I think I laughed once in the entire film.
B000N4SADC|3.0|I know no one's going to agree with my review but I've had six months to listen to this album now and I just can't get into it the way I enjoy the other Hiromi albums.<br /><br />It's fun to listen to and I'm not questioning the tremendous talent of the artists on this album.  But this album seems to lack the emotional intensity I've come to expect from them.  I can't find on this album the sense of \\"purpose\\" you feel in such songs from previous albums as Green Tea Farm, Love and Laughter, Brain, Another Mind, Legend of the Purple Valley, Music for Three-Piece Orchestra.<br /><br />The melodies just aren't memorable or meaningful, the harmonies get pretty repetitive in too many places.  But the songs are of course very technically challenging and executed very well.  I think on an artistic level it's not totally fair to compare previous work to new work, but the fact remains I own 4 Hiromi albums and only one of them I never listen to anymore.
B000BT97AO|1.0|I purchased this based on the amazing reviews...I should have asked around a bit more. I think this suffers from that 'art house' group who think that anything that is 'out there' or simply different means it is better.<br />My family (wife, 12 and 7 year olds) absolutely hated me for making them suffer through this, and in fact it has become a running joke whenever I pick a film \\"not another Mirrormask is it dad?\\"<br />The film was interesting looking, and if that was the only aim, it was a successes. Other than that it is confusing, bizarre, at times even painful film of work.
015603283X|4.0|The Club Dumas is, essentially, an intellectual thriller in the vein of The Name of the Rose or The Historian and, like those books, deals with unorthodox subject matter - in this case, the world of antiquarian book collecting and, oddly enough, Alexandre Dumas, the famed French novelist and author of The Three Musketeers, among others. The book attempts to, truly, bend the minds of its readers and at this it succeeds in a pleasant way, although it can at times be too postmodern for its own good - and seems very pleased with itself when it is.    The Club Dumas involves a shady book-hunter named Corso, who is hired by a wealthy collector to find copies of a book entitled The Ninth Gate which contain coded woodcuts purported to be of (literally) infernal origin, and whose puzzle, once solved, imbues the solver with immense power. Corso is himself a tormented hero in the 20th century tradition, although we don't quite know why (he does, however, seem to have an unhealthy fascination with the battles of Napoleon). The hunt for this book takes Corso down a number of strange thoroughfares and meetings with a number of interesting characters, including a few that seem to have stepped out of The Three Musketeers itself. Layers upon layers of intrigue pile up and lead to an exciting and highly unexpected climax that will have you mentally thanking Perez-Reverte for his creativity. I for one look forward to reading more of his works.    This is not, however, a perfect book. There are things that simply stand out a seeming a little bit silly - and the author makes some references that only those familiar with Umberto Eco will get. While a slim volume and a quick read, it can get a little esoteric at times and, as I mentioned, too postmodern for its own good (in other words, the author tries to be too clever in his attempts to sort of break the 4th wall of the novelist/reader relationship and it comes off at times as cloying rather than clever). However, all in all, this is ahighly recommended read, and I hope you will enjoy it.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|I have waited months for this to come to the big screen and it surpassed even my wildedst dreams!!  I felt the casting was just perfection!  Each and every cast member fit their role and played it EXTREMELY well I thought.  Johnny Depp, of course, was magnificent in this role, displaying the madness/rage the character had to feel.  If you love the play, you will love this!  Just remember it IS a moive and there will be differences from the play....judge it as it as....not a play but an extraordinary film adaptation of the play!
B000VWE5OY|2.0|I don't quite know what this show was aiming for. I think an Adult oriented show for people that liked Doctor Who and over the age of 18.<br />Sure, Captain Jack was there but he was not the fun rogue that he was on Doctor Who but a drull leader of a group called Torchwood. Pretty much everyone was so serious that they weren't engaging enough to hold your interest and the chemistry and writing were not there to suck you in and make it a real guilty pleasure.<br />The Producers idea of being an adult show seemed to be throwing a sex scene in every so often for titilation purposes. Sex is fine but only when the story really calls for it and it makes sense for other reasons that  just being there to be there.<br />The last three episodes of the season did improve a bit and am hoping they continue with the writing similar to these last few episodes. One can only hope they lighten up a bit.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|\\"People talk so much s*** about me in the barbershop, they forget to get their hair cut.\\"-Kanye West<br /><br /> Kanye West has never conformed to the music industry in any way.  His physical style is unique and so is his production and his lyrics.  His first two albums, \\"College Dropout\\" and \\"Late Registration\\" are magnificent and innovative, and his third musical effort, \\"Graduation\\" is also memorable.  If one can look past Kanye's cocky attitude, occasional temper tantrums, and his uninhibited mouth, he or she will know that an extremely talented man lies within him.<br /><br /> \\"Graduation\\" is easily one of the best albums of 2007.  The vast majority of the tracks are uptempo; most of the production is really good, yet kind of familiar to his past production.  I was impressed by his lyrics.  He is undoubtedly one of the best lyricists in the world of rap at this juncture.  One flaw with his lyrics, however, is that he does not always stay on one subject with his songs.  But, few rappers are able to do that consistently (the only artists who have mastered that skill are 2 Pac, Eminem and Talib Kweli).  I appreciate the fact that this album is succinct (his first two albums are longer, and lengthy albums aren't always necessary).  Also, there are no interludes, and, since most artists feel the need to inundate their LPs with them, I'm delighted he decided against it.  There are two versions of this album, an explicit and clean version.  Another thing I feel the need to bring to potential buyer's attention is, although there is an explicit version, this album is definitely NOT derogatory.  Kanye's mouth isn't too vulgar, so many kudos to him for that as well.  The guest appearances are all weak; the only one that is remotely memorable is the one with T-Pain.<br /><br /> The album begins with two of the album's strongest cuts, \\"Good Morning\\" and \\"Champion.\\"  The midtempo \\"Good Morning\\" contains good production creative and amusing lyrics.  I had to listen to \\"Stronger\\" quite a few times in order to enjoy it, but it's a good song, and it's different.  \\"I Wonder\\" is another great song, with the inclusion of heavy synthesizers.  The production is very \\"Kanye\\".  The lyrics are weak compared to other tracks on this LP, but it's a decent song and it fits here very well.  I am entertained by \\"Good Life\\" every time I hear it.  It's a catchy song with great production.  Anyone who follows Kanye knows that he samples a lot.  He sampled Michael Jackson's PYT on \\"Good Life.\\"  The beat for \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\" is rather eerie, almost scary, but the overall track is good.  It's definitely not one of his best songs, but, the irony is, one of his best lines is featured in this song: \\"So if the devil wears Prada, Adam and Eve wear nada!\\"  Wow, that is soo creative!  Kayne starts to slip as the album progresses.  \\"Barry Bonds\\", \\"Drunk and Hot Girls\\" and \\"Flashing Lights\\" are all sub par overall.  Lil' Wayne is an amazing lyricist, but he just falls short here.  \\"Everything I Am\\", \\"The Glory\\", \\"Homecoming\\" and the incredible Jay-Z tribute, \\"Big Brother\\" help to give this album the four star rating that I granted it.<br /><br /> Kanye fans, or rap/hip-hop fans in general should go ahead and purchase this album because you are sure to be wowed by his lyrics, his beats, his unique voice, or all of the above.  Kanye continues to prove that he is worthy of being mentioned when speaking of good and enjoyable music.  4 shining stars.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"Champion\\"<br />2. \\"Big Brother\\"<br />3. \\"Everything I Am\\"<br />4. \\"The Glory\\"<br />5. \\"Homecoming\\"s in order to enjoy it, but it's a good song, and it's different.  \\"I Wonder\\" is another great song, with the inclusion of heavy synthesizers.

B00003CX9Q|4.0|I was almost disappointed to find out (from Wikipedia, darnit) that E.T. has long been viewed as a  kind of Christian allegory.   That particular interpretation dawned on my benighted critical soul relatively recently.  I assumed that others had come up with similar interpretations and that probably somewhere out there some enterprising film student--or DIVINITY scholar--had gotten a dissertation out of the notion.  So I never laid claim to much originality there, but when I ultimately did make that connection on re-viewing the film a while back, I decided to roll with it.  As it turns out, you COULD make a case for E. T. as a kind of parable.    In my own case, it occurred to me that E.T.'s glowing heart (and those of his fellow aliens, also glimpsed in the film) reminded me of something.  Oh, yeah, I realized eventually: it's reminiscent of the the \\"Sacred Heart\\" imagery from my Catholic boyhood.  E.T. as a Christ figure?  Then I started making a game of it.  Came down from the heavens, sure, sure.  Has HEALING powers, aha!  Suffers the little children unto him (and avoids all contact with yucky--and corrupted--grown-ups); he dies at the hands of oppressive authority figures but is resurrected and, well, he ascends to the heavens thereafter.      It all fits rather neatly, but would a nice Jewish boy like Steven Spielberg really have set out to make a Christian fable.  He joked about it himself apparently, asking how he would ever be able to explain such an effort to his own mother who ran a kosher restaurant in L.A.  Moreover, would a Christ-figure actually avoid interaction with all adults or would he--as the Biblical Jesus did--start to shake up the status quo as much as possible.  And turning water into wine is one thing, but downing a six-pack and inducing a drunken state in the ten-year old child with whom you've telepathically bonded is quite another matter!    I jest, of course.  But since there have been serious attempts to classify Snoopy as a Christ figure, I guess the case can certainly be made for E.T.  (at least he's SUPERHUMAN).  What it's really all about, of course, is those universal archetypes that nearly all cultures embrace and employ in one shape or other, and which artists employ overtly or covertly for their rich symbolism.    Another little apercu.  In this age of sequels, prequels and spin-offs, it's commendable that Spielberg and crew never attempted to cash in on the E.T. phenomenon and come out with E.T.2 a few years later--or E.T.25 more recently. For once, a story which could have easily been \\"sequel-ized\\"  (Elliott visits E.T.'s planet; E.T. returns to Earth and runs for president) was left alone.  A \\"Second Coming\\" in this instance could only have been disappointing--with E.T. phoning it in rather than phoning home.  Thank the good Lord for Mr. Spielberg's restraint.

This frothy prattle is for jerkwads who pepper everyday conversations with Pippi Longstocking and J.R.R. Tolkien references.

B000VWYNNW|4.0|I miss Robert saying, \\"In between last time we came and this time, we managed to get an album out called Houses of the Holy, and . . . \\" at the beginning of the song, The Song Remains The Same.

B000VWYJ86|4.0|In \\"The Bourne Ultimatum,\\" Jason Bourne finally gets closer to the truth about his identity. The simple story, which often looks as if repeating that of \\"The Bourne Supremacy,\\" goes non-stop with shaky camera, not giving us time to think of the implausible situations in which our near superhuman hero constantly is.     But what really matters is action, and \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" gives us plenty of them. Paul Greengrass, who had directed \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" and stunning \\"United 93,\\" uses documentary-like camerawork again that goes with fast and frantic pace and the film's actions (especially that of \\"hide-and-seek\\" sequence at Waterloo Station) become very intense and gripping. Once actions start, you just cannot stop watching them because they are so compelling.     From the opening chase in cold Russia, we follow the globe-trotting story of amnesic assassin Jason Bourne trying to survive the relentless attacks from CIA (using CCTV cameras and contract killers, too). He also has to find out his real name, his real identity and everything about Operation Blackbrier. But, you know, after all they are just part of the film - his secrets are not very surprising after all - and though I prefer more orthodox kind of camera, I am sure that the film's thrilling actions including car chase in New York City are never disappointing.     Another merit is the film's cast with Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. The supports include Julia Stiles, David Strathairn, Scott Glen, Paddy Considine, Edger Ramirez, Daniel BrEl, Joan Allen and Albert Finney. Among them David Strathairn is a standout as CIA Deputy Director and so are Joan Allen and Julia Stiles. Thankfully both Joan Allen and Julia Stiles are given more substantial parts than before, playing the roles key to the survival of Jason.     The story (which I believe was rewritten many times) is not convincing, but each set-piece of action and actors' performances make up for that. This is the fit final chapter of Jason Bourne trilogy.
B000OIL43K|4.0|This is likely a quasi-legal release of the TV film.  I've seen a DVD on a small label if not already this edition.  Like the many purported DVDs of \\"Let It Be\\", this looks a bit iffy.  I've seen VHS releases on MPI Home Video in the '80s, which used to also have the US video rights to what some fans consider the Beatles' only two real movies (we all know which ones!), as well as a few TV specials.  It would make sense if Apple and Abbey Road Interactive (formerly Picture Music International, Capitol/EMI's home video arm) reissue it themselves like they just did \\"Help!\\".  The bonus features could be the videos (then short films) for most of the B-side of the US LP, and lost footage (I've heard there's some out there).  Maybe interviews with supporting cast members like their old friend Victor Spinetti (who plays the speed-screaming recruiting Seargent [not Pepper!]) in one memorable scene) and Nicola could seal the deal.<br />The movie is cinema verit&eacute; to sum it up simply.  There's no script or feasible plot.  An assorted cast of characters.  Costume changes, early music videos, a stripper, a pub on wheels, maybe some acid and such, a document of the age.  Some people may have assumed Magical Mystery Tour was a live tour, though those stopped the previous year, as we all know.  You have to take it for what it is.  A lot of what happened at this time is well documented in Beatle lore like the rest.<br />I think that The Who's US label Decca/MCA must've ripped off the concept for the \\"Magic Bus\\" LP cover just to cash in (Paul McCartney and Pete Townshend are famously friends).<br />This aired in late 1967 on Boxing Day (the day after Christmas for those of us outside the Commonwealth) in black and white on BBC 1 (not everyone had a colour TV in those days!).  The critics finally had a chance to let the Beatles have it.  This was the generation gap, of course!  It was their first failure since making it, proving that life is not a success-only journey.  It was aired in colour a week later, but the damage was done.  Plans to air it on ABC in the US fell through, and was not seen here for several years until screened at Beatlefests, midnight movies (not as much like Rocky Horror), and eventually TV.<br />This isn't bad, though, as I've seen worse in my day.

Not only do we get the 1982 theatrical cut and the 1992 director's cut (which has floated around on DVD over the past few years), but we get Scott's \\"final cut\\" of the film, the 1982 international theatrical cut, and the ultra rarely seen work-print version of the film; plus the massive 3 hour plus documentary entitled Dangerous Days, which finds Scott, Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Casidy, David Peoples, and a horde of others reflecting on the film's progression from Philip K. Dick's \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" to what we have now. The set is featured in a plastic briefcase, and contains conceptual art from Syd Mead, a hologram-esque film cell, a replica of Deckard's Spinner, and a replica of the origami unicorn. As for the film itself, Blade Runner remains a spectacular and bleak vision of the future that remains a landmark in science fiction and film history. If you are a fan of Blade Runner, it is simply a no brainer that this complete Five-Disc set is an absolute must own.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|I started to watch \\"Babe\\" once when it first came out on VHS and had gotten rave reviews. I don't think I was in the mood to watch it and thought it was silly. So I only saw a few minutes of it.    Recently, I visited friends and got to watch the whole movie.  It was absolutely wonderful:  funny, tender, heartbreaking, good over evil.  It was sweet and a delight.  I would recommend it to anyone, child or adult, although a child would need to see it with an adult to have some stuff explained.    And a happy ending.  I love movies with happy endings !!!
B000YENUIG|5.0|EASTERN PROMISES as written by Steven Knight and directed by David Cronenberg is one of the grittiest, insightful, and well-acted films of the year.  Maintaining his keen eye for the dark side of life and the people who dwell in its shadows, Cronenberg has once again brought us characters so strongly etched on film that they will be remembered for many years.<br /><br />The setting is London where lives the enigmatic Russian-born Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen in an Oscar caliber performance) who serves as a driver for a cloaked mysterious Russian family, members of the Russian mafia called the Vory V Zakone, a bizarre brotherhood populated with men whose lives of crime are told in tattooed stories on their bodies.  The head of the family is the elegant restaurateur Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) whose son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) carries on the crime aspects of the family but shows no role of leadership in his dissipated life style.  As the film opens we observe the birth of a little girl to a drug-addled mother Tatiana (Sarah-Jeanne Labrosse): she dies during childbirth having been delivered by a midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) who herself has a history of a stillborn child.  Anna finds a diary in Tatiana's purse, saves it, and takes it to her uncle to translate it form the Russian.  Opening the diary opens dark secrets for Semyon and Kirill: Tatiana was apparently one of the many illegal Russian prostitutes imported by the Vory V Zakone crime syndication and was raped by Semyon whose daughter was born as Tatiana died.  Anna's investigation as to the baby's heritage includes the invaluable help of Nikolai who despite his past has a soft spot for Anna and her plight and it is the manner in which the interplay of Anna, Semyon, Kirill and Nikolai works out that brings the film to its conclusion.<br /><br />The acting is impeccable with Mortensen, Watts, Cassell, and Mueller-Stahl at peak form. Cameo roles by Sin&eacute;ad Cusack and Jerzy Skolimowski, among others, are fully fleshed. The accents are believable and the multiple tattoos on Mortensen's body (seen fully in the much ballyhooed bathhouse scene, more about killing than about voyeurism) match the dark, dank atmosphere well captured by the cinematographer Peter Suschitzky and echoed with the musical score by Howard Shore. This is a tough movie for the squeamish to watch, but the story is superb and the film is Cronenberg at his best.

0312330529|5.0|This novel was recommended to me by a friend from India.  She said it is the most accurate and empathetic book she has ever read about her country.  I found it to be one of the best books I have read in a very long time, and I am a college English professor.  The story is seamless and immediately engaging, so don't be put off by the 900+ pages. Not only did I gain a \\"good read,\\" but I also learned so much about the culture of Bombay and its inhabitants both native and foreign.  I highly recommend this book.  Although I began with a borrowed copy, I ended by buying my own to keep.

B000J103WK|4.0|This is an awesome concert video of the Eagles in Australia. It's over 2.5 hours of great music. All the familiar hits from the Eagles and some from the solo careers of Glenn Frey, Don Henley & Joe Walsh. You have a choice of Dolby 5.1 surround or stereo sound, but there's no Dolby True HD.    The advanced menu you usually get with HD DVDs isn't here either. If you press MENU, the concert stops, then takes you to the menu screen. No cool pop-up menu at the bottom of the screen while the concert plays.
B000ICLRHK|5.0|I haven't watched Speed in many years.  Now the timeless classic is on Blu-ray in all it's cinematic glory.  These movies make it clear why Blu-ray is what the director intended his movie to look like after all these years.  After all the movies that have come out recently that use computer graphics it's great to watch a movie that uses traditional special effects and stunts.<br /><br />Speed could be considered an epic in what it has done for action movies.  The sit on the edge non-stop unpredictable action that makes movies like this great.  The name of the movie implies what the movie is about.  Dennis Hopper plays a deranged man who is out to get what he believes is his.  He will do anything to get it including killing dozens of people.  The only thing that stands in his way is an action cop played by Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />Although some of the acting could be considered cheesy at parts it is still good.  Sandra Bullock does an excellent job in one her first big movies.  This movie did enough to put these stars on the blockbuster map.  Of course after watching the movie some of the scenes are very unrealistic but that is why you need to watch the movie without being a critic which is sometimes hard for me.  From the first minute on the action was intense and the movie stayed fun making this a movie I could watch over and over again as I already have.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version is excellent with a very refined picture and greatly improved sound.  This is how the movie was intended to be seen.  Especially when watching it on a big screen with full surround sound.  For anyone looking for a great action movie in high definition this is it.
B000053GTF|5.0|This is the best collection of Celine's hits seen in live concerts and the original music videos.As excellent like listening to CD.These songs are the &#34;trademark&#34; of Celine that every fan must have.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Now I doubt many of you who read this review have not seen this movie.  I also would think many of you who have watched it probably have it on DVD.  So let me save some people from having to read on.  If you have this movie on DVD should you buy it? Probably not for $20 but if you have yet to get this movie the Blu-ray option is an excellent choice.<br /><br />The story features all the favorite actors like Chevy Chase, Beverly DiAngelo and Randy Quaid.  Clark Griswald played by Chevy Chase just wants to have a normal traditional Christmas.  Of course when it's a National Lampoons Christmas everything is far from ordinary.  The comedy in this movie is non-stop.  From the crazy antics of Clark to Randy Quaids outstanding outlandish performance as the red neck with his crazy family.<br /><br />Now as many have rated the Blu-ray version I am here to say it really looks decent.  Not excellent.  The picture is clear and much improved from the DVD version.  The sound is decent and played thru all my five speakers.  Like I said earlier if you already have this on DVD your best bet is to stick with it.  Otherwise this is a great addition to anyones Christmas collection.
B000W4HIX6|2.0|Let me start by first saying that I am a hugh DIE HARD fan, all of them for that matter. They rank amoung my favorite action movies of all time. OK, now for my opinion of the Blu Ray which is reflected with 2 stars. There is no value here - seriously, if you have it on DVD stick with that. I was extremely disappointed when I watched the Blu-Ray as I was expecting the colors to pop and they don't. The audio did however sound somewhat better. Skip this one on Blu-Ray and pick up Casino Royale, now that is a 5 star Blu-Ray.

B000YENUI6|5.0|David Cronenberg's crackerjack neo-noir, \\"Eastern Promises\\" is at once a brooding character study and a highly atmospheric thriller, and certainly rates amongst the Canadian iconoclast's best work.    Anna (Naomi Watts) is a London midwife obsessed with tracking down the relatives of a newborn infant, left behind by a 14 year-old unwed Russian who tragically dies on her delivery table. Intrigued by the Cyrillic scribbling in the dead girl's diary, Anna turns to her Russian-speaking uncle, Stepan (Jerzy Skolimosky) for translation. Stepan staunchly refuses, citing his \\"old country\\" superstitions and soundly admonishing his niece for \\"stealing from the dead\\". Undaunted, Anna follows her only solid lead, a business card for a Russian restaurant that she finds in the diary. Anna soon gleans that she probably would have been better off heeding her uncle's intuitive warning, because the diary reveals itself to be a very hot potato to some extremely dangerous and scary individuals. Before she knows it, she is pulled into the brutal underworld of the local Russian Mob.     Viggo Mortensen delivers one of his most accomplished performances to date as Nikolai, the Siberian driver for a psychotic mob captain (Vincent Cassel) who is the son of a godfather (Armin Mueller-Stahl). It is amazing to watch how effortlessly Mortensen, Cassel and Mueller-Stahl disappear into character. These skilled actors make it easy to forget that they are in actuality American, French and German; you do not doubt for one second that you are watching native Russians, who live and die by the rules of \\"vory v zakone\\" (\\"thieves in law\\", a strict code borne from the gang culture of Russian prisons).    Screenwriter Steven Knight revisits some of the themes he explored in \\"Dirty Pretty Things\\"; namely, how the various immigrant communities go about assimilating themselves (legally and otherwise) while still maintaining a sense of their native culture. (I think this is the aspect of the film that has somepeople drawing comparisons to \\"The Godfather\\"). The only quibble I had with Knight's script was a \\"twist\\" toward the end involving one of the main characters that doesn't quite gel with the rest of the narrative.    Cronenberg, who initially built his reputation on Grand Guginol excess, has slouched toward a lean, almost poetic style in recent films that he has nearly perfected in \\"Eastern Promises\\". For the hardcore Cronenberg devotees, not to worry; the director's propensity for viscerally \\"shocking\\" images and squib-happy bloodletting is still on display, but it doesn't feel gratuitous here; these characters live in a violent and brutal world, and it's par for the course. As per usual, Cronenberg slyly infuses some twisted black humor into the mix as well. One scene in particular, involving an attempted mob hit in a steam bath, featuring a fearlessly naked Mortensen and an unblinking camera, is an instant classic.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|The only good thing about nobody else going to see this is that I could see it on the big screen without a large crowd of people talking.  This movie was clever, funny, suspenseful -- wonderful.  I loved the people in it most of all.

B000KKPN5C|4.0|I recently bought a Nikon D40 and then bought this flash unit as the pop up flash on the D40 just didn't cut it. This is a great flash for the casual photographer that likes to take good pictures. It really adds depth and color to photos. It is inexpensive, small, light, and simple to use. Turn it on and it's ready to go. How much simpler can it get? No settings to get wrong. No added weight. No wasted space in your bag. I was surprised at just how small this unit was when I first opened the box but for a small flash, it sure packs a punch. I use it a lot inside a gym for my son's basketball games and I was surprised how far it reaches. My only complaint is that it could recycle quicker but overall, it is an excellent flash unit for the $$$.
B000K7VHSM|5.0|Beautifully filmed movie! Mr. Lee deserves his Oscar. You have to keep your mind wide open to watch this movie; as wide as the cinematography allows you to. Keep in your mind and hearts the human sensibilities and emotions portraited by the actors. You don't have to be gay to understand their relationship; there's no sexuality in the human spirit, but only in the love that we feel for each other in the purest sense. I found myself teary eyed at the end of the movie.
0439813786|5.0|This book brought back to our family the magic of reading a full novel. The author has all the components of a great writer: inspiration, a capacity for plot development, solid background research, intricate drawings that are warm and rich in texture, and a profound dash of literary flair.<br /><br />I read it to my 6 year old daughter, Jan&egrave;t who was captivated for the 3 hours that it took to read (about 1/3 of the pages are full spread illustrations that continue the story like frames from a movie). The suggested age of 9~? is preposterous. This book is magical for historians, science fiction buffs, kids of all ages and anyone who likes a story with a great wind up and resolution.<br /><br />Bravo, Brian! An excellent read.
B000WAGVHE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was musical, colorful, and most of all, refreshing. Kudos to John Travolta's multi-facited talents; even though he didn't make a pretty woman. Although, the original actor wasn't pretty either. To say the lease, it wasn't just all balls to do the part, but lots of make-up and padding! If John gets nominated for his supporting efforts, I wonder if he'll attend the awards in drag; it would be a hoot, wouldn't it?
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I loved the story and effects (except the ascended one on one fight scene which was lame, i hope they change it for the final release)    I will definitely buy this one when the retail version becomes available    *yes i have seen it so no QQ pls, thanks
B000LXH0AE|4.0|This clever and well made film is about a man, IRS agent Harold Crick, living a life of Thoreauian desperation who turns out to be a character in a novel.  In the course of the movie-novel, Crick undergoes something of an awakening, the character of which has a bittersweet quality because of foreshadowing of Crick's death at the conclusion of the novel.  Some of themes pursued are the nature of art and free will versus determinism.  This is generally done well, though the film is a bit too much of a conventional romantic comedy.  Though Will Ferrell is infinitely better than his usual scenery chewing, he doesn't have the emotional range for an outstanding performance.  Most of the other performances are good and Emma Thompson, as usual, brings surprising depth to her role.
B000K15VSA|5.0|...and that's a feature on the life and works of Vangelis. Being a fan of his music, I regard him as one-third of the central triumvirate of what drives this film (the other two being Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford). Aside from that, I can't complain about this latest incarnation of the movie. I'm not that much of a fan of sci-fi as I regard it as extremely far fetched and obtuse. As was mentioned in one of the feature DVD's in this set, science fiction was often cloaked in a cheerful, glossy setting where technology would see man through his problems. Blade Runner, on the other hand, practically indicts technology as fomenting them. There had been some like-plotted movies prior to Blade Runner's release (i.e., Soylent Green, Silent Running, etc). However, I, like the general audience of the day, was seeing science fiction through that cheerful prism, which explains its initial failure at the box office and subsequent popularity after we digested it. Take the opening titles: no grand crescendo orchestrated by John Williams against a galactic background, but the ominous drum-of-doom beat against a blacker-than-black background. In stark contrast to the background, is the date of November, 2019. When you see something like that as a teenager, you think, \\"Oh my God, this is what the world is going to be like when I'm in my fifties\\". Granted, the time span between 1982 and 2019 is too short for the technological innovations and the additional skyscrapers that we see in the film. I doubt we'll see these things until at least 2150. However, such chronological proximity only adds to the movie's shock value and goads the audience into thinking. The only indication that it takes place in Los Angeles is in the front credits. It's not its sun-drenched self, but a dark, rainy, mega city that's as cheerful as Detroit in winter and as garishly, phony as Las Vegas. There are no light speed transports, no cute or ugly alien life forms, no heroes, no villains, but rather a high techextension of our industrialized society and dehumanized pop culture.
B000NA28HU|5.0|It was a very relaxing experience watching this movie, and all of the special effects used.
B000YA9R3C|5.0|Featuring a phenomenal performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood brings to life as charismatic and captivating a character as any to grace the screen this year. Comparable to the epic journeys of Charles Foster Kane and Fred C. Dobbs, the mesmerizing progression of Daniel Plainview from prospector to oil entrepreneur and \\"family man\\" makes a compelling character study rich with the flaws of greed, hubris, and competition. Traversing several decades of Plainview's struggles with family, the church, and the business he so loves, There Will Be Blood meticulously recreates a time, a place, and a man with feverishly brilliant detail.<br /><br />In 1898, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a determined prospector who strikes silver in Texas and in subsequent searches discovers oil. By 1911 Plainview is a self-proclaimed \\"oil man\\" who operates several wells with his adopted son. When he's approached by Paul Sunday, who swears there is oil literally seeping out of the ground on his father's ranch, Daniel expands his business and begins buying up all of the property in the area. Such aggression doesn't go unnoticed however, and the ambitious businessman soon finds himself at odds with larger oil companies and the fanatical local church led by the guileful Eli Sunday (Paul Dano).<br /><br />The music by composer Jonny Greenwood is sensational, and perfectly complements every scene. At times the violins screech like a frenetic horror film, amplifying the atrocities of Plainview versus himself or presiding over introductions to marked location shifts, and at others it is melodic and impassioned, contrasting the contemplation of despicable character choices. Music plays during most of the film, tying together speechless segments and narrating the tone of conversations. Beautifully orchestrated, it is ever-present and manifest, but never interrupts the visuals onscreen.<br /><br />Religion plays a strikingly offbeat role in the film, primarily in the form of Eli Sunday. A truly fanatical leader and a proclaimed \\"false\\" prophet, Eli attempts to further himself and his church through interfering with Daniel's oil prospects. Although Plainview is also unscrupulous and irrational, Eli's unbalanced preacher role is so immoderate that it clearly displays religion as discordantly nonsensical. His performance is obsessively masterly, and his comeuppance at the conclusion packs a bigger punch than this year's Michael Clayton, with its undeniable crowd-pleasing finale.<br /><br />Daniel will do anything for his oil pipeline, symbolizing the idea of wealth and perseverance as opposed to necessity, including receiving a baptism in Eli's Church, an act he loathes. Grimacing through the entire derisory process, with which Eli takes perverse pleasure in tormenting the unbelieving Daniel, he gets his pipeline and later his revenge.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis embodies Plainview with such passion, authenticity and an overwhelming screen presence that an Academy Award certainly won't elude him. His dismal declension from a two-faced, shrewd businessman to an emotionally unstable soulless shell, who can barely stay sober and who, despite having everything has lost everything worthwhile, is effortlessly the greatest of this year. Comparison to Citizen Kane is natural due to Plainview's downward-spiraling character arc and his aberrant greed slowly separating him from humanity, but There Will Be Blood covers ground that Orson Welles' masterpiece approached dissimilarly- the love of his son and the times they spent together replace Kane's cherishing of his childhood.<br /><br />Daniel's separation from his child both physically and emotionally doesn't come entirely from avarice, but from Daniel's inability to enjoy other's company sincerely. He hates most man and sees the evil in everyone, a self-loathing complex that causes his brash decisions to steadily become more volatile. \\"I have a competition in me,\\" Daniel seethes. \\"Iwant no one else to succeed.\\" Never forgiving himself and unable to deal with his son's deafness and his decision to ignore it, like Kane there is nothing but tragedy waiting for Daniel. He is unable to revisit the love he once possessed for his son and abandons everyone and everything in the pursuit of his fortune. Likely never fully realizing that his greed has distanced him from humanity, Plainview finishes with so much and yet so little.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinshimself and unable to deal with his son's deafness and his decision to ignore it, like Kane there is nothing but tragedy waiting for Daniel.

B0007WZWXQ|5.0|I can understand why some people dislike the Loch Ness song, but this 13:30 minute opus is one of new favorites of heavy metal. It smacks of the sort of neo-gothic claptrap we associate with the late 70s and \\"Spinal Tap\\" era, but (at least to me) seems more fun and ironic than melodramatic. It's about time ol' Nellie got the classic metal treatment.    I suppose you could read into the lyrics a more Freudian interpretation (water is a classic symbol for the subconscious, and the monster lurking beneath the waters could be a repressed desire).     The other songs on the album are mostly of the hard drivin' type; they make great background music for some World of Warcrafting. If \\"Revolution\\" doesn't make your neck twitch with latent memories of headbanging, I don't know what will. Finally, the chorus is back!    One notable  exception is the ballad \\"Angel,\\" a catchy and poetic song that some longhair will probably want played at his funeral or wedding. \\"Eulogy\\" is in the same vein, though here we do seem to be tottering towards the melodrama.    In short, all of the songs here range from decent to excellent, though to my mind \\"Loch Ness\\" is what moves this album from the \\"maybe\\" to the \\"yeah, I'll go ahead and order it.\\" It's by far my favorite song from the album and deserves a listen.
B00000K3CK|5.0|It's Christmas Day as I am writing this review, so what better thing to do than to review one of the classic Christmas movies!  This is an emotional movie, pulling all the right strings to get the audience's predictable response.  And it works well!  This is, for what it's worth, in my judgment, the preferred Christmas movie.<br /><br />It has many different components that make the overall production work.  First, the cast.  The lead players are well portrayed, with John Payne as the idealistic attorney, Maureen O'Hara as the flinty, pragmatic non-nonsense mother of the \\"too grown up for her age\\" Natalie Wood, acting early in her career.  Other actors fill out the cast nicely, with William Frawley as a hard-boiled political operative to the judge, Gene Lockhart, who will preside over the court case that serves as the climax of the movie.<br /><br />Second, the plot line is crisply laid out and moves along nicely.  A drunk Santa Claus at Macy's is replaced by Edmund Gwenn, who calls himself Kris Kringle.  His behavior is at first thought harmful to the store--but redounds to Macy's benefit.  Then, he is accused of being mentally incompetent because of his belief that he is, in fact, Santa Claus. John Payne, who has become close to O'Hara's character, takes Kris Kringle's case to court.  There, the befuddled judge has to make some politically charged decisions.  Such as: Is there a real Santa Claus?  If so, is Kris him?  The US Post Office plays a key role in the outcome, and there is a happy ending--with a special nice touch, with the last lines being film classics.<br /><br />So, yes, there is a contrived element to this movie; yes, it pulls strings on the audience; yes, the ending is a bit schmaltzy.  But, yes, this is a wonderful movie and deserves to be telecast each holiday season.  A genuine classic!
B00062RCBW|5.0|I've owned the TNG collection since 2005 and I never get tired of throwing in a random DVD and watching an episode.   The most amazing thing (in my opinion) is as the seasons progress, each actor develops his/her own character into a unique person.   For example Captain Picard's (at times) abrupt \\"short\\" leadership style mellows by the third and fourth seasons and as such you will enjoy the transformation.   Also if you watch closely you can see support actors making return performances as different characters - interesting.   BUT in true Star Trek tradition the most amazing thing is how the writers continued to out do the earlier seasons by coming up with ever more imaginative plots and story lines.  The collection is already timeless and continues to fill that void that so often develops in our regular TV programing.  If you are a sci-fi fan and (at times) disenfranchised TV viewer,  then I recommend that you buy this collection - it will save you! .  5 stars!
0525950079|3.0|Similar characters only the names have been changed, so it seems. It's a shame because I really enjoyed reading Pillars Of the Earth however with this book it was a long labor and at times quite frustrating especially the \\"on again, off again\\" love affair of the main protagonists. Anyhow, in all it was still entertaining which is the main point of a book of this type. I must say though it has sparked my enthusiasm to learn more of Medieval Europe and am keen to read more of the feudal systems of the time.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This is a fascinating film.<br /><br />It has a sweetness about it that is generally reserved for classic holiday films like \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" yet manages to maintain a modern sensibility and complexity.  Too often, films of this type are overwhelmingly sappy, and artificial.  This one felt genuine and real.  The main characters seem intelligent and earnest.  I really believed the love the two main characters developed for each other, and I liked that it developed over time rather than \\"love at first sight,\\" which tends to be a common movie cheat to save time.<br /><br />I liked it so much I tried to find others like it, and while I did find some, they were nowhere near as good.  This is a real standout in the genre.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

This is by far the best version of this album, 24 BIT REMASTERS, only available for Japan in this format. A must have in any CD collector's library.   NOTE: Universal titles are highly limited!
0937381888|5.0|John Palmer's How to Brew is a masterpiece of technical writing.  The arrangement, layout and appendices are arranged in natural order such that you could tape the book to your kitchen counter and begin reading and brewing on the spot.  The text ebbs and flows through general technique (how-to) and detailed theory (why and what) a lot like natural conversation.  It reminds me of sports-talk, how it starts with a team's standings, moves into analysis (\\"75% of the time the defense plays Cover 2 on 3rd and long\\"), and then back out again.  Palmer's magic is that he stays accessible; everything remains relevant and everything flows.     The only difficulty I have with the book is that a number of discussions don't quite explain the topic to me.  For example, \\"Malliard Reaction\\" is mentioned a few times in the book but after using the index to read all the related sections, I still don't know what it means.  Finding the answer is a few clicks away on the net, so there's no real problem here.     At the end of the day, How to Brew works.  It gives you the option to Brew and Understanding, or just Brew, and that's a beautiful thing.  You can sit and have some tea, or you can follow the rabbit down the hole.   You chose.  And in either case you get a carboy of beer out of the deal, so you win, too.
B000XCZGVI|4.0|This is not a shoot 'em up, fast action, dramatization Hollywood movie. If you want that, watch \\"The Shooter\\", \\"Smokin Aces\\" or something like that. This is more of a study of the guys who tracked down the Zodiac killer. It's not about the murders, it's about how painstaking it was to piece together clues. It's about patience and obsession. Robert Downey has never been more convincing.     I rank this right with \\"No Country For Old Men\\" and \\"3:10 To Yuma\\" as my favorite films from this past year.
0618680004|2.0|First off I have to say that I agree with most of Dawkins' writing, but this book is not well written. It is filled with quotes and Dawkins freely borrows from other speakers and writers. I do not enjoy this sort of writing as it is choppy and lacks a smooth flow. When one writes a book about religion and God it is particularly important to keep it very clear and logical in contrast with religious writings that thrive under mystery and supernatural events. Unfortunately although Dawkins has clear thoughts, he does not communicate them in a smooth and enjoyable manner. Nevertheless this book is valuable in its attempt to bring atheists (as Sam Harris says there should not even be such a word much like no word exists for nonbelievers of Zeus) into the mainstream.     As Voltaire said: \\"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him\\". There is a strong tendency for humans to believe in something supernatural. Ever since the beginning of human existence there is evidence that humans worshipped some version of \\"God\\". This need to believe in God (of course it does not mean that there is actually a God) for better or (mostly) worse is inherent. Dawkins' efforts to convert and enlighten people is commendable, but I doubt this book has converted any Christians, Jews , Muslims, etc... Interestingly I think Dawkins' The Selfish Gene may have had a greater influence on religious folks than this book. For more clear and enjoyable atheist writings try Sam Harris. He is an outstanding author and more compelling.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|As round four in the Die Hard Series Live Free or Die Hard has the same general mix of bad guys with their evil plot never quite what it seems (and it's really always about money), the outlandish action scenes and super cop (McClane) who never seems to stop going no matter how much he gets hurt. I actually think the plots are fairly plausible, however unlikely, and pretty well thought out- the movies have all been fun to watch, this one is no different.    I watched the unrated version and had no complaints except to say that I never found the music video and commentary that are listed as being on the DVD, where are they? One commentary that I didn't try out- no other extras at all, not even a chapter list or behind the scenes mini feature. Just a little more stuff would have helped make the movie an even better value.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Despite an extraordinarely successful career, Stallone still has the fire in his belly to push himself beyond ordinary limits. He cleaned and overhead pressed over 300 pounds and that is not easy at his age. Or any age for that matter. The filming was good and the characters very human and credible. Especially Stallone's, considering the whole series is admittedly based on fiction. The fighting was real and Stallone clearly got himself back into very good shape.<br />I had no intention of seeing this movie because I figured the obvious. That Stallone must be banking on cashing in a few bucks with die hard Rocky fans. Then I read some reviews and decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did.<br />I enjoyed the specials section as much as the movie. Stallone explained the background, logic and filming behind many of the scenes. Absent his noteable stage presence, his voice is pretty easy to listen to. He also seems quite thoughtful, intelligent, and down to earth when explaining the movie. Basically I got two movies for the price of one. But then I have grown more fond of thinking and less fond of action in my middle age.<br />Stallone has been such a great talent through the decades. Too bad so much was squandered on overly simplistic movies. A choice he seemed to almost deliberately make. I have read that he chose Cobra over Beverly Hills Cop? C'mon. Cobra is almost a cult classic but any film savvy person would see the very limited appeal (personally I'm the guy who has seen it four times).<br />Go Rocky go! I plan to see the next Rambo now.
B000VNMMR0|2.0|Bruce is back with his usual antics!  It's a predictable plot for all us die hard junkies.  But this time Bruce achieves super hero status as he accomplishes impossible and unbelieveable feats.  Lauching an empty car to take out a helicopter that is 20 or thirty feet in the air?  Please!  I watched the movie all the way through, but went away with a feeling of time wasted.  Oh well, guess I'll just wait for the next episode!  Once a die hard junkie always a die hard junkie!
B000UR9TQE|5.0|Listen to this with a good surround sound system!  Night and day compared to the old version.  Worth the $20 bucks and then some!
0446619078|5.0|What makes Harry Bosch one of the great characters in all of fiction are his flaws. Harry is suspended for assaulting his boss, he is being checked out by the department shrink and he decides to investigate an old homicide - his mother's. Great story, solid characters - you can't go wrong with Michael Connelly.

B000002UAF|5.0|Ok, so the Beatles were waaay before my time. In fact, way before even my parents' time, too; but I love this album. I don't know what all the one-star reviewers are complaining about because I think this album is excellent. Unlike, some others out there, I'm not a die-hard Beatles fan but I think that John and Paul are two of the best songwriters ever, and I love the way they sing together on these tracks. Of all the Beatles albums, I like this one the best because it has some of my favorite Beatles songs on it---If I fell, And I Love Her, and I'll Be Back.     The Beatles are timeless. Their songs have been covered more than anyone else's, and the songs all still sound great even though its been almost 40 years since they were first released.
B000060OFT|5.0|As a person who grew up reading Shakespeare, watching plays based on his works, reading/comparing the original to other productions (West Side Story, China Girl), I must say I absolutely LOVED this movie.    It was a visual masterpiece.  Younger people who think Shakespeare is a 'bore' will simply learn to love him through this work.  The soundtracks are simply breath-taking.  Leonardo was a very believable Romeo and Calire Danes was an excellent and strong Juliet.  I've watched this movie in the theater, and I own the DVD.  One of the best investments I've purchased for my movie collection.
B000UD08HW|5.0|Outside of the typical complaints about the video quality of this recording, I have to rate this a 5 star video. The musicianship is absolutely top notch. Dave Gilmour sounds great vocally and his guitar playing is peerless. The setlist is killer. Considering the scope of over 30 years worth of material being jammed into a 2-1/2 hour show, you couldn't ask for more.<br />Echoes is worth the price of admission alone. Unbelievable. I was literally floored at the performance of that song alone.<br />Quit crying about the video quality and enjoy this amazing show.
0743490304|5.0|Deception point has a hook that will come get you by the end of the first read.
1878424505|5.0|I just love how this book can be applied to everyone.  It really doesn't matter what type of person you are or where you're from...you will be able to understand the message presented; moreover, you will be much happier when you adopt the four universal, obvious (yet more difficult to apply in real life when you ask yourself at the end of the day if you have applied the four principles throughout the day) principles.      Definitely a five star book.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|The '07 release 'Once' certainly won't blow you away with state-of-the-art production values. In fact at times it will make you feel as though you're watching someones home movies. However once you move beyond all the usual Hollywood expectations of what a good film should be you'll find yourself deeply involved in this simple and sensitive story and personal invested in the charming relationship evolving between Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova.<br /><br />Follow along as their chance meeting on the streets of Dublin turns into an opportunity for the two to explore their past failures and heartbreaks through the medium of musical composition. As their portfolio of songs grow the beginning sparks hinting at the possibility of something more between the two come into play. Will the musical muse give way to its kindred spirit Cupid, or is the music all they really share?<br /><br />Terrific film from beginning to end with an excellent soundtrack comprised of the songs created by the two main characters in the storyline. This is what independent filmmaking is all about!
0143038583|4.0|I particularly enjoyed Pollan's account of the life of a steer bound for the dinner table. However, eating grass-fed beef is a little more complicated than Pollan indicates. We've raised grass-fed beef for years here in Maine, and its desirability seems to rise and fall with whatever food issue is ascendent. When red meat fell out of style, so did our beef. Now grass-fed beef is all the rage, but I doubt this trend will last, for this simple reason: grass-fed beef is leaner and more flavorful, but it also produces cuts of beef that consumers don't want to bother with---lots of pot roasts and stewing cuts that require gentler (and longer) cooking than a steak that's thrown on the grill. There's nothing \\"fast food\\" about much of a grass-fed steer. In short, a return to lean, local, and humanely raised meat requires a change in cooking habits.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I find the premise delightfully original: a mathematically-obsessed IRS agent (Will Farrell) starts hearing a women's voice ( Emma Thompson) in his head. Eventually, he discovers she is a...no need to reveal too much of the plot. Just waiting then finding out the source of the voice in his head is enough to make this more interesting than most movies. There are light touches of humor that blend in a charming way with the bittersweet drama of the story. When it comes to movies, I'm hard-to-please & I my experience with  \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" was absolutely enchanting.
0434012602|5.0|Pulitzer Prize Winner. In this classic we read about Scout Finch who is an outspoken, literate six-year-old tomboy when she begins to tell of growing up in a small Alabama town with her brother and her attorney father Atticus. The children's curiosity about a reclusive neighbor is eclipsed by Atticus's attempt to defend a black man against charges of raping a white woman. I would recommend this book for anyone in high school and older readers. This is a must read book.
B000063COX|5.0|I remember when I got this, it was kind of at a moment's notice. However, I consider it a very lucky moment after hearing only a few seconds of this album, and listened to it all the way through the first time around. Iron Maiden is normally remembered for their Bruce Dickinson years, but if you ask me, Paul Di'anno is an excellent frontman, too. Sure, Di'anno and Dickinson may have different styles, but Di'anno's style perfectly suited Iron Maiden's early sound.  Now, if you've heard at least one Maiden album before, you're probably pretty aware of their style. Their debut, \\"Iron Maiden\\" already shows a lot of their style, in addition to a bit of a more punk-metal style.  \\"Prowler\\" opens up with two awesome guitar riffs that harmonize together as Paul kicks out a great vocal performance to add to the sound. An energetic strutter of a song, this is a great way to kick off the album.  \\"Sanctuary\\" has one of the faster, more punk-styled riffs that keeps up with the fast tempo of the song. A catchy chorus is featured here, as well.  \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" is a slower, balladic styled song with slower guitars that offer a melody as odd but interesting as the title itself. It's songs like these that influenced Metallica's ballad-styled songs like, \\"One\\" or \\"Fade To Black\\".  \\"Running Free\\": Thumping drums and a swinging bassline start this song off, which features one of the catchiest and coolest choruses on the entire album.  \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is a very unique, epic-styled metal song that runs at over seven minutes. A very creative and well-written song, to say the least.  \\"Transylvania\\" is a great instrumental song that serves as an excellent lead into \\"Strange World\\".  \\"Strange World\\" is one of the more unusual songs the band has written. It's very cool, featuring surreal lyrics and more great instrumentals. One of Steve Harris's most underrated songs around.  \\"Charlotte The Harlot\\" features an awesome sing-a-long chorus with pounding drums, and later on in the songturns into a very emotional ballad, before shifting to a blistering guitar solo that definitely rocks.  \\"Iron Maiden\\" is the three and a half minute album closer. Combining several guitar riffs, a fast tempo, and just three verses (though the last one is marked as the chorus), it is one of the most memorable songs on the album, and yet another great part of the Iron Maiden catalogue.    Overall, \\"Iron Maiden\\" is an excellent album, and all songs are strong and well-written. I would definitely recommend this to all Maiden fans and metal fans in general, and even though there's no Bruce Dickinson or Dave Murray, this is definitely one of the greatest albums, and especially debuts, in heavy metal history. Merry Christmas to all! Thanks for the time, and peace.
076781326X|5.0|I come back to this film several times.  I find it noteworthy for several reasons.  The most important of which are the acting talents of the two male leads, Ron Moody and Oliver Reed.  Both gentlemen add the right spark of chemistry to this dark Dickensian tale of bad vs. good.  I love the voice of Shani Wallis as well as her performance.  The film tends to be a bit slow at times -- I do not suggest that it needed editing, just moving along.  The musical numbers are breathtaking.  This picture deserved the Oscar, and Onna White's choreography is inspired and fun!    Catch it.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|Considering I'm a hardcore Daft Punk fan, I just had to pick this up. Man alive, was I lucky that I did. Whether you're new or not to Daft Punk, this is an excellent CD. This is good for newcomers because it offers a lot of the songs from Daft Punk's three-album (studio album) catalogue. More longtime Daft Punk fans like myself will love it because it takes some of their best songs and works them all together in techno-styled jams.  I would honestly never imagine myself listening to a 74-minute album all the way through, but Daft Punk has made such an awesome live album that I loved every second it. The way they take, sometimes as many as four songs and combine them on one track offers such creativity, and there are plenty of moments on this album that will make you think, \\"That's awesome!\\".  Trust me, if you like Daft Punk, or you want to get into them, get this! Thanks for the time, and peace, and a Merry Christmas to all!
B000VR824S|5.0|I purchased this concert for my 3 daughters, an artist brother in law and sister, and for my husband and I. The music is a thrilling celebration of multiple artists who have changed history over the 49 years of my life with their music, and who now, in recovery from various drugs of choice, continue to change the lives of those who are hearing the message of recovery for the first time. Eric Clapton has chosen to serve others by providing a treatment center where those in need can find the help he found not too many years ago. I not only wanted my children to carry on the memory of this remarkable man and artist, but to have a part in donating to this important place of healing and hope for others. 5 stars to Clapton for this, perhaps the greatest work of art he's accomplished so far... and one still in the making.  P.S. SEND THEM MONEY!!!!:-)
B00005JPLW|1.0|Having read the book that the movie was based on I was very disappointed with the screen version. All the \\"special effects\\" tended to distract from the actual story which in my opinion is one of the greatest stories of a small group overcoming insurmountable odds in the history of this planet. The film turned it into a bloodfest of epic proportions - which it certainly was - but it was also a triumph of a small group who held a pass long enough for the main army to get settled and eventually kick some Persian butt. So if you have read the book do not have high expectations of the movie.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Not much to say except it came on time and in the condition it said it was in.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I thought I asked for his most recent album but got this instead.  What luck.  I was bowled over, as was my 14 year old who said right away, \\"I want this on my i pod.\\"  I was surprised that most of the songs I liked most were the ones in Italian, even though I don't understand it.  Although I have to say that \\"Weeping\\" was far and away the best track and affected me deeply.  This is my first real introduction to Josh Groban and I am sure that my house will see (I guess, hear) a lot more of him.
B00000J2PH|5.0|For anyone that enjoys classic rock and roll this is a must for your music collection. Every song enjoyable.
B0007PAMR4|1.0|This is the Alan Smithee version, extended edition, that has been available over the Internet for years, poorly edited, with repeated scenes, like the same Harkonnen landing shuttles scene use several times along the movie, in other inserted scenes the Fremen do not have their Ibad (blue eyes); another nagging example: the movie jumps from wide-screen scenes to full screen ones! No wonder David Lynch disavows this version.
B00004S875|5.0|Listening to the SACD version of this record is my first experience with true SACD 5.1 channel sound, and I am definitely hooked.  This recording sounds great! I had the original vinyl record decades ago, so I know it's a great album. What is worth raving about is the superior quality of the SACD format.     I find it sad that with the pervasivness of MP3 players (and the MP3 format), we are in a time of degrading quality of music reproduction. People are choosing convenience of delivery over quality of the sound.      This record sounds terrific in SACD. I'm now going to purchase as many SACD formatted versions of CDs I want to get as I can find; either pure (SACD only) or Hybrid SACD. The Hybrid format does make more sense.     If you like Billy Joel and appreciate high quality recording and reproduction, this is a must have CD.
B000OLGCI4|1.0|While the Jungle Book remain one of my Disney favourites from my childhood days, watching this cropped version virtually killed all the magic that was in the movie. I was so distracted by all the cropped heads and feet there was no way I could concentrate on the plot. So much of the background and scenery was lost that it just threw the scenes off balance. Why even call this a platinum edition when the original 1.37.1 aspect ration was not preserved? Isn't that what a platinum edition is all about? Ever see a cropped Picasso or Van Gogh? This is the worst Disney release to date and I would hesitate buying another Disney release if they are all going to turn out this way. A total waste of money. Disney should refund or offer to replace all discs from dissatisfied customers.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|Being a fan of the City of Evil album,this new one struck me too. It is solid,but nothing much different from the previous.The strong rockers and ballads.Pretty complete.Almost Easy,Afterlife,Gunslinger,Lost and Dear God complete a real solid rock record.If you liked City of Evil,check this one out.It's not earth shattering,but should please.I give it a solid 4 stars for a continuation of the trademark Avenged formula.
B00005JPTI|1.0|I know there were those that enjoyed this movie as an adaptation. How, I dont know, but good for them. I, for one, thought otherwise. It would have been a decent enough movie, in its own right, had they called it something else. But they didnt.     The only thing this movie has in common with Matheson's (amazing) novel is the name of the protagonist. Thats it. Every single other identifying mark was changed, moved, or taken out altogether. Matheson must be rolling in his grave at this point.     If you want to see an adaptation, watch Last Man On Earth, with Vincent Price. At least in that one, they got most of it right.
B000YENUI6|2.0|I saw this in the movie theatre, based on the rave reviews. Maybe it caught me on a bad night, but I found it to be an ugly, squalid movie about a bunch of repulsive people. What is the appeal? Obviously, audiences didn't cotton to it, as it bombed at the box office.<br /><br />Storywise, for a film that purports to \\"realism,\\" it stretched credibility. We're supposed to believe that Naomi Watts' character, an ordinary, everyday midwife, gets in cahoots with Russian mobsters. Viggo Mortensen is an excellent actor, and he certainly is a riveting presence, but the charged, charismatic appeal he displayed in \\"A History of Violence,\\" was only allowed to erupt briefly in the memorable bath house sequence.<br /><br />The dialogue, spoken in low, accented murmurs, was impenetrable. There are awful attempts at both overt and black humor.<br /><br />Most of all, though, this movie attempts to portray slimeballs as something fascinating; there's not even anything thrilling or artistically satisfying to compensate. A thoroughly depressing, grimy piece of filmmaking.
038572179X|4.0|With all of the recent hype surrounding the Academy Award nominations for the film version of Atonement, I decided to purchase the novel to read on my flight home to Florida.  On the first page we are introduced to Briony Tallis, a precocious 13-year old with an overactive imagination and a penchant for the dramatic.  Indeed, when we meet her, Briony is putting on a play she wrote for her brother's homecoming.  The action of the novel revolves around Briony, tottering on the fine edge between childhood and the world of the adult, a world she desperately wishes to enter as it provides an escape for her from the childish fairytales she finds herself writing.  Not quite emotionally or mentally equipped to fully absorb and understand the actions of the adults surrounding her, the narrative follows the consequences of Briony's misunderstanding and ends with her ultimate \\"redemption\\".    Ian McEwan's singular talent is an uncanny laser-like insight into the intents and purposes of the human heart.  His characters (Briony, Cecilia, Robbie, Emily et. al) become more than two-dimensional representations on the page, but living characters with depth and breadth. A writer of stunning detail, McEwan's narrative is quick, the interest sustained by fluid descriptions of not only the characters, but also of time and place. (For those with delicate sensiblities, the novel contains the occasional use of strong language, but the usage is neither gratuituous, out of place or unwarranted). I'd give the novel 4.5 out of 5 stars if the option were available. A wonderful read and highly recommended.
B000Y179KO|5.0|First off I'm 55  - saw the Eagles a couple of times in the 70's. I was really excited to see a NEW MATERIAL from let's face it  - one of the BEST AMERICAN BANDS ever.     It's Christmas afternoon, my wife got it for me, it's my first listen.    Oh sure, the EAGLES are rich, mostly obnoxious slobs with huge EGO's and all but C\\"MON - this is WONDERFUL new music - they STILL got it!    But, the reviews are weird - I see too political - \\"Henley's always been Political\\" - dentist office music - \\"uh remember Best of my Love\\" - \\"Tequilla Sunrise\\" - I even saw they sound too much like the 'old Eagles - \\"well who should they sound like? The SEX PISTOLS?\\"    People - be happy this happen - if you ever even remotely liked the Eagles you must feel uplifted that you can hear these voices with new material again .     C'mon were'nt you getting a little tired of playing all the old stuff?    Thanks Don, Glenn, Timothy & Joe and Merry Christmas!
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|I bought this record for my daughter. She loves the movie and the book. In fact Jane Austin is a favourite writer of her. And I must say that I liked the movie too. Not in the least because of the music which succeeds in bringing back the spirit of the movie and the concerned time period. It's refreshing to hear and certainly recommendable.
1400079276|3.0|This was certainly a compelling read though, upon reaching the end, a significant source of disappointment as the various lines of surrealism are never reconciled with each other and with the overall plot. In this sense the novel is much like an extended dream sequence, with magical elements that are unexplained and don't follow the laws of cause and effect (Nakata must get to Takamatsu, but when he does his task upon arriving there is rather pedestrian and the novel is not at all clear as to why he is the one who needs to complete it. And whatever happened to Nakata in his childhood, anyway? And who killed who?). Reminiscent of David Lynch's Lost Highway.  On the other hand, certain characters hold forth on the philosophy of life as though reading from their graduate school essays.  Despite these complaints, the novel is quite enjoyable, particularly if one doesn't hope to understand it all by the end.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|This is a wonderful compilation from the Johnny Cash TV shows. It brings back old memories. Johnny Cash was a visionary bringing folks on his show from diverse backgrounds. He ignored political flack and took on the TV keadership who wanted more conservative shows. The musical segments are intertwined with short interview segments placing the music in a historical perspective. Well worth the price. I could do without the few relgious songs, but it is part of the Johnny Cash story. I recommend this DVD to any oldtimers and any generation Xers or millenials who enjoy a historical perspective on popular music.
B00080ZG10|1.0|[[ASIN:B00080ZG10 The Aviator (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]  This is the second DVD I have purchased from you that I cannot use as it is the wrong region for Australia.  How do you think I feel that you send me a Christmas present from my family that I cannot play in my country.  Surely, an organisation as large as yours would have products suitable for Australia.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|It is many years since I first saw this as a film in a theatre and my memories of it were such that I was almost scared to play it again on DVD lest it not live up to the memory. I needn't have worried - the intervening years and seeing several wonderful live productions have taken none of the lustre off this very special offering.   Almost unashamedly filmed as a live performance on a set that allows the action to move easily through the many scene changes effectively, the camera moves from panoramic into close but never closeup. The result is totally satisfying and one can only wonder why other opera films since have not followed this principle because it delivers a perspective that entirely stands on its own (and minimises anomalies).  In the title role, Cesare Siepi is mesmerising. Recognised as one of the greatest Don's ever, one can easily see why. Vocally completely in charge of the role he moves with such incredible grace it is hard to take one's eyes off him. The gestures and facial expressions seem to capture every nuance, giving \\"the supreme cad\\" a certain \\"charm\\" one seldom sees in lesser performances.     Elisabeth Grummer as Donna Anna & Erna Berger as Zerlina are two ladies whose careers were regrettably, negatively impacted by WW2. Both were performers of great distinction and it is a joy to see how competent they really were. Ms Berger was over 50 at the time this was filmed but the sensible camera placing combined with her coquettish (not overdone) approach to the role overcomes the obvious and easily allows the suspension of belief so often necessary in opera.     Lisa Della Casa as Donna Elvira is another performer of yesteryear whose performances have become somewhat legend (and too few recordings). Known for her beauty as much as her voice- it is great to have her permanent record of a Donna Elvira that is more studied and less frantic than many. Walter Berry is a competent Masetto and Anton Dermota as Don Ottavio, delivers a darker richer toned sound that is always totally secure.     Otto Edelmann as Leporello is a delight bringing great character to the role despite some minor pitch problems during his opening aria, \\"Notte e Giorno faticar\\". Once past that, he doesn't put a foot wrong.    All in all, I believe that this is a production that has a magic all of its own and it deserves a place in any opera lover's collection. Many people say it is one of the top 5 opera DVD's of all time- I can't disagree.
B000OY8NII|5.0|I really enjoy the writing for this show. Worth watching if you haven't seen it.
B00005JKQZ|1.0|This movie film too much to play twists on the audience. Through-out the entire movie you try to figure out whether Crow is truly insane, then the director throws more tiresome scenes into the mix. In the end this film tries too hard to be Dramatic & loses its focus mid-movie.

B000LAZDQA|3.0|After viewing this a couple of times, I would probably send it back.It seems to have a lot of the story edited out. Too bad, it could have made an excellant film. The nudity is casuality integrated so that it isn't sensationalized.

B000VL9XNI|5.0|I purchased this item for a Christmas gift, and the recipient was THRILLED to receive the present.  In addition to the discs, lots of other memorabilia items are included in this product that are worth as much as the cost of the discs!
B000YABYLA|5.0|I was stunned at this movie - what a terrific blend of comedy and drama. I left the theater reminded of 2006's Little Miss Sunshine, which also deserved attention from the Academy & other film festivals. But Juno was actually even better.<br /><br />The plot is simple (teenage pregnancy/coming of age), but the film is filled with nuance, unconventional humor, and some very thoughtful and touching moments. All of the acting was superb, without exception, but especially Ellen Page. I left the theater wanting to see it again.<br /><br />There were several things that made it exceptionally funny or thoughtful. I liked for example, the metaphor of the boys track team, and how they kept running in circles (a theme which runs throughout the movie, no pun intended). I also liked that in the end, the most creepy, most dysfunctional & maladjusted characters were the mid-upper class white suburbanites, and in the end, it was the urban working class family that pulled together to work out the dilemma.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite part of the movie was that Juno's parents, as dysfunctional as they were, still did not react to Juno's pregnancy with hyper-anxiety, by blowing up, etc. Their response was imperfect, but at least it was compassionate, and was supportive of her daughter and her decision. In the end, it was Juno's body, Juno's decision...and even though she was only 16, she showed tremendous strength and resolve (moreso than the adults in the story). Juno was immature, naive, made many mistakes...but she was true to herself and her own self-discovery and her own process. Certainly an endearing character (and actress), and certainly a good role model for most of us, young and old.<br /><br />This was truly an original story - free of the typical cliches & jokes, and not one stitch of toilet humor. There's a lot more I could say about this movie, but the bottom line: I'd like to see more movies like this, and I'm so glad this one made it into the mainstream. Two thumbs way up. A full 5 stars.
0316067598|5.0|Marcus Luttrell took me through BUD/S training, hell week and then to Afghanistan. The sacrifice of these men in the fight on terror kept me glued page by page. I read the whole book over a weekend. I could not put it down. There are countless of reviews on this book via Amazon. I am not here to give you another synopsis of this book. I am just saying that if you care about our country, if you want to find true patriots who sacrifice themselves in the name of the USA then you found them.
B000001GQY|5.0|Jochum said this recording was the best thing he'd ever done, but obviously impressions vary.  Maybe I had the advantage of limited expectations and a personal crisis the first time I heard it, but it literally made me shudder.  The opening sequence, which others here have described as \\"ponderous,\\" struck me with an almost religious clarity.  I found it utterly convincing - a revelation, seemingly, of the true Brahms, which I had hitherto never grasped.  I was never a big fan of Brahms before; his music seemed too dense, too murky.  But this recording bring out an inner life in the music; a sleeping giant seems to awaken here.  I listen to Brahms differently now.      I can name perhaps four or five recordings of similar power, including Furtwangler's version of Schubert's 9th with the Berlin orchestra, Beecham's version of Sheherazade with the Royal Phil., Bernsteins' version of Mahler's 5th with (I think) the New York Phil., and Haitink's version of the Shostakovich 5th with the Royal Concertgebouw.  These are all desert island recordings in my opinion.  Add now Jochum and Gilels' Brahms concertos.    I recommend this recording without reservation.
0790742780|5.0|I'm not a white collar worker but man can I indentify:) Great movie, seen it more times than I can count.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I got this for my birthday a couple of weeks ago and have hardly taken it out of my CD player.  It flows really well; great hooks, great lyrics, great muscianship, great production.  If you have heard Love Song and are thinking of buying this, you will most certainly enjoy the whole album.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|I will not into great detail about the plot.  You can read the reviews for that.  However let me share my impressions.  I saw this with my wife in a theatre where there were only 11 people.  Eight of them were on their cell phones through out the movie. I really can't say for whom this is geared for.  It is not a children's movie and it has a old time feel about it. It is more like an adult is remembering something from his childhood.  It is told from an adult perspective.  There are scenes that are very intense for young kids and not gory enough for teenagers.  Young couples and people in their 30's may not respond to it, but for older people it sits well with us and we find it enjoyable.  It very lovely to look at and the pirates are rather charming.  As I said is a strange movie for what kind of audience I don't know.  It reguires patience to sit through and is worth the time, but it feels dated for the most part.  A very strange moive to review.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|A satisfying conclusion that answered many questions about Jason Bourne- but who could tell with the camera and editing?      Shots seldom stayed stationary for more than 3 seconds- during the action scenes it was less than 1 second.  An overabundance of zooming in and out, switching vantage points, scanning from one place to another, and blurs made it impossible for the viewer to focus on anything.  In some scenes this was an asset, such as when Bourne is safely directing a reporter who is being tracked.  But overall the quick changes made it so difficult for the viewer to process what he just saw that it actually made it more difficult to follow what was going on; you had to take alot of the action on faith because you never got to see it yourself.      Each time I see the movie I have a headache halfway through.  This is a shame since the movie has alot to offer. Besides the satisfying storyline, the settings could have enhanced the movie had we been allowed to see them. Damon's performance brings a deeper maturity and humanity to Jason Bourne.  The CIA has a tension and animosity between the leaders while Julia Stiles brings an exceptional performance while hinting at Bourne's life before the amnesia.  The action appears to have been thought out and executed- either that or the reason behind the sloppy editing and camerawork.    This movie is worth it to see what becomes of Jason Bourne- but will probably never be viewed again.
6305949980|5.0|This movie is a cult classic... and in my own opinion, the last good creation to come from Tim Burton. All of you 90s kids, such as me, will really appreciate this movie's witty humor, classic word play, beautiful music. Danny Elfman did a very good job with the music in this movie. It was also the first full length movie of it's kind, I believe... Tim Burton utilizes Stop-Motion Animation, giving this classic it's own unique style. I highly reccomend this beautifully done masterpiece... best of all it is a great movie for both Halloween AND Christmas/Yule =D
006091307X|5.0|The Crying Of Lot 49 is one of the most strikingly brilliant masterpieces in literary history. Its length (less than 200 pages) and economy of language belie the maze-like complexity of its plot, as well as Pynchon's literary virtuosity. It's a relentless puzzle, an engrossing mixture of comedy, tragedy, mystery, and post-modern fable. It's satirical and ominous, hilarious and menacing, spacious and paranoid, decadent and moralistic, simultaneously as exciting and unpredictable as a well-drawn piece of escapist fiction and strangely philosophical. Its mixture of accessibility and complexity is what makes it such a masterpiece- the novel draws readers in with its quirky opening scenes, developing multiple unique and instantly memorable characters before the first chapter is even over, before hurling its protagonist (and the audience) headlong into a mystery whose implications are both fascinating and nerve-wracking. From there, the story becomes a strange, haunting tale of rebellion, isolation, and paranoia, while simultaneously maintaining its sense of humor, widening its cast of fascinating characters, and hurling a few satirical darts at the ins and outs of modern life. Somehow, the story never loses its focus, as each of its elements feeds off of the others, creating a dense and deliciously cubist tale of insanity and curiosity, ultimately building towards a quietly cathartic climax and a strangely satisfying ending. Genius!
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Say what you will about the movie, some people like it and others don't, but Leonardo DiCaprio out-acted every big star in this movie including Jack and Matt. Who garnered the most sympathy and carried this film? That's correct it was Leonardo.<br /><br />I have watched his performances over the years and he's shown mostly a gentle side. He started to come out in The Aviator and that may have been where he garnered the energy to put this performance together.<br /><br />When I checked the movie out, I thought the casting was remarkable. They put together an expensive, very expensive cast. Jack was a big as ever, maybe bigger. Matt was big too, when he had the sound stage to himself. All this celebrity carried their own scenes. Leo in contrast to Leo looked remarkable.<br /><br />His superior acting became obvious when he interacted with Matt. I consider Matt a king among actors, especially his performances in the Bourne series. In the Departed Matt looked vacant compared to Leo.<br /><br />What distinctions do I see that had Leo as the superior of the cast? First, he held his own against Mark Wahlberg, which I consider generally difficult to do unless your a beauty wearing lots of skin. Next, he held his own against Jack. That's not only difficult to do, but Jack didn't have to act down to his co-stars. Jack acted straight on with Leo. Jack put in a remarkable performance, even though his character lacked sympathy. He still had to bring his \\"A\\" game to his scenes with Leo. I didn't even know Leo had an \\"A\\" game.<br /><br />We can break this down scene by scene, but you can judge this yourself. Watch the movie and notice who gets your attention the most. In every scene, Leo takes over. My eyes went back in forth when Leo and Jack worked together. Perhaps I was nailed by Leo's character. I don't really think that. I would have them do a role reversal and Leo had the most energy. That energy put him over the top.<br /><br />Finally, toward the last scene when Leo's character is killed so suddenly, I couldn't believe it. It was in such a shock that time seemed to stand still.<br /><br />Only a Martin Scorsese could make all these superior actors work well together. He balanced and juggled as well, if not better, that he ever has. This film has little redeeming value without the star power including the director.<br /><br />I'll never know who brought Leo out. I suspect Leo did, but that's a guess. I wonder if Martin has the time to coach Leo. Again, I'll never know.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, then watch it. The blood and guts didn't bother me at all because it was so much a part of the fabric. I disliked blood and guts movies as they are about B&G. The Departed is about character and strength and ingenuity.<br /><br />Judge it for yourself.e it. It was in such a shock that time seemed to stand still.

0743482832|4.0|One of Shakespeare's most beloved works, The Tempest is a classic tale of adventure that combines revenge drama, romance, and comedy, all of it driven by magic and the supernatural. The play also uses manifold references to ancient myth to develop its sense of seabound peril, while drawing brilliant parallels to the colonial impulse that was then rapidly on the rise in Europe. Indeed, one of The Tempest's most singular triumphs is how it metaphorically addresses the complexities of colonialism in ways that somehow manage to speak to 20th and 21st century concerns. Of course, Shakespeare being the genius that he is, there's more to it than that- this is also a story of love, revenge, redemption, and political intrigue, full of well-drawn characters and unexpected plot turns. It doesn't rank with Shakespeare's best (in my opinion, anyway)- it doesn't have the stunning emotional impact of Hamlet or the labyrinthine psychological exploration of Macbeth. It's a gem, but a slightly minor one compared to his greatest masterpieces. But then again, what isn't?
B000TXZVGQ|4.0|Love this boxed set! Lots of interesting information on the Bonus Disc. And the book included is very cool too! This is one of my favorite shows and I was so excited to finally recieve it when it came out in a special set!
1594489505|5.0|I decided to read this after completing the Kite Runner.  This is a very good read and opens your eyes to the many things which plague women in less developed countries.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|This is a great ending to Howard Shore's movie trilogy of music from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". This is one release which I really anticipated getting. I love everything on this four-disc set. \\"Mount Doom\\" and \\"Crack of Doom\\" will put you right back into the movie as will \\"The Battle of the Pellennor Fields.\\" I have enjoyed reading the reviews here but must say I have a different point of view from the fan who said Liv Tyler's track is a bit weak. I found Liv's track, \\"The Houses of Healing\\" to be soothing and very moving. If you are on the fence, hop on over and buy this wonderful set. I don't believe you will regret it.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Having just finished watching this, I am still shell-shocked.  While it shows a different time frame of Germany than Schindlers List or The Pianist, it is no less moving.<br /><br />The other reviews are much more articulate than I when reviewing but surmise it to say, this is a great movie.  I was living in southern Germany when the wall came down and had heard what it was like to visit the East Germany but to see it portrayed in this movie was eye opening.<br /><br />Deserving of the Academy Award it won.  Wonderful.  I will buy this for my collection.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|Have not found a Johnny Cash dvd yet that was not worth the price to watch and his latest \\"Best of Johhny Cash TV 1969-1971\\" is no exception.  You won't be disappointed!! The guests are fantastic, especially Kris Kristofferson and Tammy Wynette and Johnny is as usual at his best. You just can't go wrong purchasing this new Cash dvd.
031286504X|1.0|This book is has been misrepresented as the entire \\"I Am Legend,\\" rather than a compliation of short stories.  Of course, it is my ignorance that led me to believe that I Am Legend was a novel rather than a short story.<br /><br />Regardless, the story starts off as an attention grabber, but it only goes downhill from there.  While Matheson creates a fabulous premise for a novel, he fails to deliver a well developed literary work -- particularly with the end.  It just falls flat, as if Matheson got bored and decided to cut it short.<br /><br />I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie, becuase most times the book has greater detail and character development, particularly when the book precedes the movie and with these such subjects.  However, this time, I am hoping that Hollywood can save this book.
B000KJU1HI|3.0|\\"Don't Look Back\\" is OK but not the masterpiece many other reviews would lead you to believe. Sound and picture quality are very poor, concert performances are attenuated (oh so frustrating!), and the verbal jousting of Dylan with reporters and fans becomes tiresome especially when we can see it's obviously just a put-on for the cameras.<br /><br />Still it does capture some of the energy of Dylan at this time - just before he went electric - and the seediness of the touring life.

B000WZAE1I|4.0|\\"Stardust\\" brings Neil Gaiman's imaginative fantasy tale vividly to life, with top-notch production and fine performances by all involved. Robert DeNiro's performance as Captain Shakespeare is priceless!
B000059Z8M|5.0|OK this movie is a great movie probably as good as the first.    To clarify that some seem to be reviewing the 2 disc \\"Special Edition\\" and others the VHS.    It seems that Amazon lumps all the reviews for Toy Story 2 or even the Toy Story 2 pack (which has both 1 & 2) together and it makes it very confusing.    My Toy Story VHS does not have 'Tin Toy'  My Toy Story 2 VHS does have 'Luxo Jr'  My Bugs Life VHS has 'Geri's story'    Toy Story 10th Anniversary DVD release 2005 Does NOT have 'tin toy'  Toy Story 2 Special edition DVD release 2005 does NOT have 'Luxo jr'  I believe Disney decided to leave them out because they planned to release the PIXAR Shorts DVD.  Also these have a sneak peak to CARS not Mosters Inc..    Toy Story 1 & 2 DVDs original releases 2000 and 2001 DO have 'tin toy and luxo jr' respectively.  The Toy Story 2 Pack DOES contain 'Tin Toy and 'Luxo Jr'    I don't know if the ultimate box has these pixar shorts but I suspect that they do because it was released in 2000 probably before Disney planned to release the Pixar Shorts on their on DVD.    Just to clarify that there are definite differences in the DVD's specials. Ultimate Box has a whole disc dedicated to the concept and making of TS.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I love playing Blokus. It's challenging without being stressful, and it's easy to learn. There's no going through a rule book, trying to figure out whether to do this or that. And it's beautiful. The pieces are lovely colors. My husband and I play, each of us taking two colors. I've also brought it to family parties to play after dinner. People of all ages can play, but it was the teenagers who were especially delighted with it. You can also play this game as solitaire, playing all the colors. Blokus is also educational: improves spatial relation skills. Another advantage is that the pieces are plastic, so the game can be played outside. We often play on the back porch in the summer and don't have to worry about pieces blowing away or getting soaked. This game is a lot of fun. Try it!
B00011F5DK|5.0|Everyone loves this game. My 12 year old grandaughter beats me every time. You can play it with all ages, even the 3 & 5 years old play. Every time you play it is a different game. You see & learn different things the more you play it.
B000V4NX04|5.0|A very potent tale in a period of history that it must not be forgotten.  Intelligent movie that one cannot get out one's head.
159102594X|5.0|This book is one of the better new books I have read for a few years. It developes its characters well, they are interesting and they move towards a purpose. I would recommend it. I am looking forward to the second book in this series more than the next GRRM book by far.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|Loved, loved, loved it.  A great adventure film, easy to lose yourself in.  Robert Deniro is fabulous as a cross-dressing pirate, and Michelle Pfeiffer is so very evil and delicious.  A very fun movie to watch.
B00005JPTI|3.0|An interesting concept that is a tad-bit underdeveloped. And why is Hollywood so New York City-centric?  I much prefer films with foreign locales (a new Jason Bourne film every two years would be fine by me!)  Anyway... Will Smith does pull-ups in this film which, for some, will be well-worth the price of admission. :-)  But that poor doggy...
0743298020|5.0|A little slow to start, but before you know it, you are totally engrossed and cannot put the book down.  Very interesting, gothic type novel that won't dissapoint at the end.  Lots of very strange characters, indeed.
B000YENUI6|4.0|David Cronenberg: \\"Scanners\\", \\"The Dead Zone\\", \\"The Fly\\", \\"Dead Ringers\\", \\"Crash\\", \\"eXistenZ\\", \\"A History of Violence\\"... need anyone say anymore about this brilliant director.  \\"Eastern Promises\\" is by far one of the Top 10 films of 2007, and Viggo Mortensen is a gem in this one and is most deserving of a Best Actor nod because any actor who does a fight-scene butt-naked deserves kudos for that, I kid you not.  (Oops, did I just uncover a \\"spoiler\\"?)  Veteran actor Armin Mueller-Stahl (\\"Shine\\", \\"Avalon\\") is also most effective and deserving of a Best Supporting Actor nod.  But most of all, it is always a genuine pleasure to see my favorite city represented in film: London.  Despite some moments of true grit and grime, \\"Eastern Promises\\" all-around is one of the best films of 2007. :-)
B000SXOI66|5.0|I purchased the original album (vinyl in those days).  Not only are each of the songs strong on a stand alone basis, but all together and as sequenced they make for an experience like no other.  No album I can recall has the power, impact, and meaning (real or perceived) as DSM.  This is one a few remarkably special albums that never get old.  It feels fresh each and every time you listen.<br /><br />This is a \\"must have\\" album for anyone that listens to music.  In 100 years, people will think of this as classical music in a league with Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart.<br /><br />FYI: I literally wore out the first album and had to buy a second.  The second was ready for replacement.  By then CD's were becoming popular, and I purchased one thinking it would last forever.  Sadly, this is not the case.  As far as I can tell MP3 files don't scratch or wear out.
B0010ZR160|4.0|Very engaging story, but the twists and turns require a greater attention span than perhaps the average person can muster. Ed Harris is amazing, as usual.  Morgan Freeman is most effective in his role and the film is given solid direction from Ben Affleck.  Unfortunately, the lack of intensity of character arising from Casey Affleck (as a principal character throughout the film) does not warrant, in my humble opinion, a Best Actor nod which the critics appear to be pushing for.  2007 Best Supporting Actor nods, however, should go to ED HARRIS and AMY RYAN.
B000CPH9I4|1.0|Am a Corrs fan, so was eager for this new album ... a trip back to their Irish roots.  Unfortunately, all I can take from the album are the \\"breathy\\" vocals ... you hear EVERY SINGLE intake of breath between notes and its VERY DISTRACTING!  I realize breathing is necessary, but it shouldn't be so front and center in each arrangement.  As it stands, I can't bear to try a second listen.  Move further from the mike already!
B000YABYSS|5.0|A very well-directed film by Denzel Washington that is most engrossing and will transport you to another place and time in American History.  There is a powerfully emotional scene between a stern father and his son that will not leave you dry-eyed.  Look for a 2007 Best Editing nod as well as a 2007 Best Director nomination for Denzel Washington, in addition to Best Supporting Actor nods for both newcomer Denzel Whitaker (no relation to Denzel or to Forest) and Forest Whitaker (last year's Best Actor Oscar winner for \\"The Last King of Scotland\\").  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! :-)
B00005JPTI|5.0|This movie is awesome. I never read the book, I heard it doesn't follow the book too closely but who cared its a sick movie either way. Will Smith at just about his best. Man has this guy come a long way from the Fresh Prince, not to mention Willenium. He is an awesome actor, does a great job in this movie and the movie is filled with excitement. Lots of shock value and unexpected. Loved it. Only regret is that the movie ends a little quick, for such a big budget film it does not follow the recent trend of epic movie means epic length film. In this case the movie would be better a little bit longer but either way I loved it. Hope you do too.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Any Buffy fan will love this collection. I watched the entire series over the summer and it was great seeing them all one right after the other.  It gave me an appreciation and a deeper understanding of the series that was harder to get when watching each week.  The commentaries are great, and the extras are fabulous.  I am so happy to own this collection.
B000W00Y0O|5.0|By far this concert has the best DTS audio along with some of the best video quality yet! this concert is 26 yrs old and looks like it was produced yesterday.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!  I was very impressed with the quality.  It was wonderful!
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Words can not even describe the movie and the soundtrack. I definitely think you need to see the film first. The music completely goes with all the scenes (scenery and cinematography).    I'm not a huge pearl jam fan. I like them, but Eddie Vedder's solo here has really given me more respect for him as an artist. The fact that he plays every instrument on this album is amazing.    Eddie said yes to producing the score without even seeing the film. He then saw it came through with these ballads which are somewhat haunting but not in a negative way. For some reason this film and soundtrack are tugging at my heart.    Best songs are: Society, Long Nights, Guaranteed, End of The Road, No Ceiling. I like all the other tracks as well but these really stick out in my mind. You hear these melodies and you take a deep breath and reflect on life and have images in your mind about the film.    I can't stop listening to this album or thinking about the film. Call me obsessed, but you definitely need to see this movie and buy this soundtrack!
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|I've seen this film in theatres twice when it first came out. All I have to say is, I was very disappointed with this movie. I've read Homer's \\"The Iliad\\", and the film was nothing like that. All that I saw was a Brad Pitt lovefest- to Brad Pitt, from Brad Pitt.
B000I5X81K|5.0|This album is a real winner. I have listened to it many times and I'm still finding new things to love about this talented young singer. He's inspired. I don't have a favorite song on this CD because my favorite changes with my mood. Where did that voice come from?? And not just the voice, the music gives me goosebumps.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Generally, I don't go in for special edition CDs, DVDs, or games. Its just the same thing with some uselessness and a higher price tag.<br /><br />This, however, is worth it. The regular CD has most of the \\"best\\" songs from the movie, but this deluxe 2nd disc has a number of gems. If you're a fan of the movie and the music, you need the 2nd disc for the full effect.<br /><br />Great music. Great CD. Great.<br /><br />coo-coo-kichoo.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I love the book, and had seen some negative reviews about this unique movie, so I almost didn't bother with it.  That would have been my great loss because even though it is totally different in tone from the book, it stands on its own merits as an enchanting Christmas movie.  There are lots of amazingly clever visual touches, e.g. the reindeer floating like Macy's balloons on their way to be harnessed to Santa's sleigh, and the montage following the lost ticket through the arctic wilderness was positively brilliant!  Christmas means different things to different people, but if you just sit back and relax, The Polar Express will give you a sweet dose of the Christmas Spirit.
0307387151|5.0|Ian McEwan's novel 'Atonement' struck a chord in me, I read it in three days during Christmas break. The main theme is the power of words and the pain and guilt that can follow. The author's rich prose reminded me of classic authors like Charlotte Bronte (my fav). I felt like I was in the countryside, London and France with the characters, whose pain was very real. Every sentence is so descriptive and directly related to the story, nothing was extraneous. It was a little slow at the beginning getting into the story, but once the hook came I was instantly addicted. I must admit it was emotional for me and yes I did cry. But it was beautifully written and I can't wait to view the film.     I enjoy watching movies adapted from film as I view them as separate forms of art. You can't put every page of a 351 page novel on screen. The director of Atonement's Pride and Prejudice was one of my favorite adaptations, mainly because I love the 5 hour BBC film, but don't have time for it in my busy lifestyle! ;)
B000E1MTZE|5.0|I watched this awhile back and finally decided to buy it.  In 1080p, this movie is gorgeous!  Highly recommended if you are a fan of the trilogy and HD DVD.  Who knows when blu ray will get it.... :P
B000YENUI6|5.0|Viggo Mortensen is flawless as a the driver for Russian mobsters in London. The film begins with a young woman arriving at a hospital where Naomi Watts works as a midwife. She delivers the baby but the mother dies, so she looks for someone to translate the mothers's diary for clues of the mother's family. She must find them before the baby is taken into the foster care system. I don't want to give away anymore of the plot, but I must say I enjoyed the film even more than A History of Violence, for it is more complicated and even more serious with a poignant human rights issue at the heart of the film. I loved the quiet steady pace of the film, and the emotion depth of the story. I sincerely hope Mortensen and Cronenberg team up for more movies in the future as I love what they've come up with so far!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|So far Ive viewed \\"Ice Worlds\\" and \\"Great Plains\\" in 1080p.  Was a bit skeptical about the series until I viewed both of these episodes.  I was amazed by the work done behind this series and the quality of the image, wow, it simply leaves you in AWE.  Highly recommended for anyone out there who owns an HD DVD player.  The price on this product may look a bit high but believe me, its worth it!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I was so touched by this film that I finally sat down and read the book (which I loved) while I was engaged, as I quoted Mr. Darcy in my invitations! The film is a triumph for director Joe Wright, as he has included the most vital points of the book, but keeps the action moving, and I must say it was also very engaging watching Kiera Knightly's Elizabeth and Matthew Macfadyen's Mr. Darcy. This adaptation explores the melancholy in the last half of the book that makes the ending that much sweeter. The score is brilliant, as I have played the piano pieces and a lady of that time would've performed them as they are difficult but playable. I loved the film and score so much I played the opening track as I was walking down the aisle! Cheers!
B000W4HJ44|4.0|Though Pfeiffer & Latifah simply continue to maintain their status as musical and entertainment Goddesses, Travolta has proven his versatility and talent in this movie by becoming a Diva in \\"his\\" own right.<br /><br />Nikki Blonsky is a delight. I adore her... she is the Ricky Lake for the 21st century.<br /><br />In the tradition of the Sound of Music, Grease, and other great musicals, Hairspray is both a cliche and timeless. I will be enjoying this movie for years to come
B00005JNS0|5.0|My son has had this video for over a year and still loves to watch it! Fun for adults too. Highly recommend!
B000PMG16U|5.0|Sorry but to sound one sided bluray is king theres more out there with bluray players being less than 300$ now and ps3 coming with bluray hd-dvd is dead its just a slow and painful fall i mean come on disney is exclusive to bluray and the porn industry is leaning more on bluray 180$ attachment plus an xbox 360 is alot more than buying a bluray player alone for 300$ or just a ps3 now at 400-500$ with blurays superior sound and picture quality someome like old lucas will know the best course of action if they choose not to release an hd-dvd version and well i would not be suprised if he did guess its all about if mr. lucas wants more money as if he needs it
B000WCDI5K|3.0|I just got this one as a Christmas present, and I'm glad. I was thinking about going to a store and buy it, but thanks Noel somebody else did and buy it for me, because, although the album is not bad at all, I would have been pissed off if I'd buy it.  Let's just take it as a B-side collection, yeah... well, it seems like they are taking all of their stuff out and there is nothing left for the fans to discover. Personally, I enjoy finding rarities and b-sides on the net, and even if the artist release a B-side collection there are some good tracks missing there (the case of Tori's A Piano Collection, where the 5th cd was a b'side compilation) but in this one, I feel like I have heard all of them, and Sawdust is not that great. I mean, this tunes didn't make the final cut for some reason right? Maybe because they are not so good. So here you have, an entire album filled with b-sides, rarities and a mix that seriously guys... is not worth it. Therefor, three stars for this one... not that bad, not that good.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This set (as stated by everyone else) is awesome!  But that's not what I really wanted to say.  I haven't read all of the reviews, so if this has been stated elsewhere, I apologize.  This set is also a numbered limited edition.  There is a numbered holographic type sticker on the bottom of the case.  Should be \\"(whatever number)/103,000.\\"  Just some info for all of you hardcore collectors.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Firstly the film is great and having the choice to see all 5 versions is a treat.  I like them all a lot BUT prefer the 1982 theatrical with the noirish narration.  It adds a shade of humanity to the film which makes it even more powerful.  It's a great film.    BUT LETS GET DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY.  Deckard is human despite what Scott has to say and any name calling he childishly wants to use.  Let me run through some reasons why:      The original source--Dick's novel--plays with the ambiguity of human/android and with Deckard BUT still CLEARLY Deckard is human not an android in there.  Hence a theme in the novel dehumanization of man and how close they were to the machines.  This theme would be senseless if Deckard was an android--and in the novel Deckard was human...it's just a fact.  The screenwriter is on record as saying Deckard was written as human in his script.  Harrison Ford is on record as playing Deckard as human.  Rutger Hauer in his bio says he and the other actors played it as was clearly understood on the set--that Deckard was human.  Hauer goes on to explain Scott's LATER claim of Deckard being an android by saying that's just like Scott--that he likes to mind \\"F\\" with people.    Okay now in the film--Deckard supposedly an android to retire other androids is a wimp.  He is physically weaker by far than the androids he hunts--including the pleasure unit Pris where needs a gun to even it up.  And with the male androids the disparity is even more ridiculous.  They throw him around like a rag doll, they bust through walls, barely feel pain through great physical distress and can jump great distances between high rise buildings easily.  None of this Deckard can do and he's not even close--all this supposedly from an android made to hunt.  Give me a break.  Batty's last speech to Deckard speaks to him as a human who doesn't understand them...you can say Batty didn't know but clearly to him Deckard was a weak human--it's so clear.  Yes Scott does make itambiguous which is what the novel does but the great preponderance of evidence on and off the screen shows Deckard is human despite the ambiguity.  Yes Scott may have had it in his mind Deckard may be an android but it's clear as it was filmed in 1982 he was NOT.  Even the later added unicorn scene is NOT definitive--just another ambiguous sign.  It could have been a dream he had before and talked about, perhaps to fellow police or a police pyschologist(he certainly had enough problems to need to go to one!).  And it could therefore be in his file and Olmos at the end could just be messing with him.  THE POINT IS--THE UNICORN SCENE IS NOT DEFINITIVE.  Just another sign of ambiguity in the film that goes with theme of the movie the dehumanization of man and the resemblance between man and machine.      So after the fact, many years later(definitely not in 1982) Scott now wants to take away the ambiguity(just like Hauer saying Scott likes to mind \\"F\\") and flat out say Deckard is an android.  This is in opposition in how he actually filmed the movie originally, how the novel and scriptwriter wrote it, how the actors understood it and the logic of the film.  Scott now even says he had the idea of the narration in 1982(because film wasn't working originally) and that narration also is clear in showing Deckard is human with no late recognition of being an android and no unicorn shown...THIS SHOWS THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF SCOTT AND THE FILM IN 1982.  The theme of the ambiguity/similiarity between man and android is clear--it would not work as android against android.  The film would be weaker then(having very little humanity) and fortunately it is not weaker since the clear signs show Deckard is human.
B00005JPTI|4.0|First, I am going to say that if you want an objective review, you'd better read a different review of this film. I went to the theaters as someone who:<br /><br />1.Had read the book, loved it and knew that Will Smith was probably not going to do an exact recreation of that book. That was fine by me. I can accept artistic license, in this case.<br /><br />2.Is a huge fan of Will Smith. I could probably listen to him read the phone book, name by name.<br /><br />3. Loves apocalyptic, vampire and similar movies, even some that others would consider cheesy, campy or just plain dumb.<br /><br />So there are my disclaimers, right up front. If you read on, you do so at your own risk...or because you have a similar mindset. But don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />I do suggest that you consider the fact that this book has been considered very hard to put on the screen - and rightly so, as far as I'm concerned. The book, a post-apocalyptic tale of one man surrounded by vampire types - is one of my favorites and I've read and reread it many times. However, I wondered how it'd work as a film adaptation.<br /><br />It isn't true to the book, not in the way a movie like To Kill A Mockingbird or The Yearling attempts to be true to the source material. Even so, I'd recommend this movie. I intend to see it again. Will Smith, generally very watchable on screen, doesn't disappoint and he reveals the unraveling of a man who is in the most desperate of circumstances, unhinged, not sure who is friend or foe or even the complete situation.<br /><br />Smith has the added challenge of appearing as a solo performer for a huge part of the film, a challenge in itself. He held my attention, utterly.<br /><br />Maybe I missed it but I never got the sense that the movie explained why or how there was an illness or disease that wiped out much of the world. Maybe a mutated virus? The cause isn't as important as the situation, a truly ghastly one, one man left amongst a group of vampirish types, crazy and demented.<br /><br /> I couldn't keep my eyes off of Smith's face as he showed a range of emotions, reminding me that the man is an extremely talented actor. If you focus only on the accuracy of the translation of book to film, you'll be setting yourself up for disappointment but if you can let that go....and take this film for what it is...and accept the vision of the director and the acting talents of Smith, you'll be in for one wonderful ride (read my disclaimers above first).<br /><br />Also, I do have to note that the CG special effects bothered me some. I'm not a huge fan of those. Yet I still intend to see the film again, allowing my selective focus to hone in on the areas of the film I loved.<br /><br />I happened to really like 28 Days Later so this might be the type of film that fans of that movie would like, too.Smith's face as he showed a range of emotions, reminding me that the man is an extremely talented actor.

B000VWYJ86|1.0|If I could give less than one star, I would. Director Paul Greengrass has created a film that will literally make you sick.     I've been a camera operator and director for over 20 years. One technique used sparingly is the so-called, shaky cam. I say sparingly. Its purpose is usually to disorient the viewer... to knock them into a bit of a funk, but only for a short time. You have to let the viewer regain their bearings, otherwise the technique backfires. Maybe Greengrass had no story to tell. It's one way to make some people in the audience believe they've been on a rollercoaster ride. It's not exactly the best way to generate audience excitement... getting them to run to the restroom to vomit.    This film probably has the worst use of the shaky, cinema verite that I've ever seen. It's in use constantly. The effect is to give you motion sickness within a few minutes. I basically had to shut my eyes after the first 5 minutes of the movie. In spot checking the rest of the movie, apparently the technique is used constantly, except for aerial shots which probably used a gyro stabilized camera mount. Why bother with the expense of a gyro mount when the rest of the movie basically jitters the heck out of your eyes. In checking the credits, the aerials had a different director of photography.    Greengrass directed the second Bourne film, but apparently used different steadycam operators. That's right, steadycam operators in their $100,000 rigs were probably shaking and snap zooming all the nauseating camera moves. But, that's what Greengrass wanted. And any future film he directs, I won't bother with... unless I want to practice my projectile vomiting techniques.    I should have checked the reviews before buying this poor excuse for a movie. This one will make you sick to your stomach. Take some motion sickness pills before you watch it, if you dare.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I've waited so long for this comprehensive DVD set of one of the finest series on TV!  Television's biggest mistake (among many) was in not renewing this show.  However, it left us with memories of these budding actors and actresses at the peak of their youth, and with a very fine plotline.<br />This is a collector's set that should be preserved and shown to every teenager who was unable to see it firsthand -- maybe even in the classroom!
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I find the Gilmore Series a good product to have,especially at the price I paid for them. There are good actors in the series. The series is funny, and yet the daily lives of these women and the community; you could think of them being your own community. Stuff happens in life and this series brought that all out well. Any one wanting to have clean every day life brought to life in their homes; I recommend this Series strongly. I enjoyed each episoed I watched on TV; therefore, I was glad to have bought this product thru the Amazon \\"Store\\".  Sincerly yours, E. Haught of W. VA.
0140120416|5.0|This is just a really fantastic resource for a beginning student. Other Russian-learning products I've tried mostly attempt to have you memorize a series of useful phrases and words. That's fine if all you are going to do is spend a short amount of time traveling and only need to ask where the bathroom is. However, if you're wanting to truly learn the language, it's important to get started with the grammar. This book does that. Right away it provides grammar tables and exercises to help you learn the structure of the language. The only downside I've found that it appears to be focused toward British students because it refers to a lot of locations in the UK. Not a big deal, though. You still are able to learn the grammar.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|When a movie begins with a teenage girl singing her way down the street on her way to school, greeting passersby with a smile and a wave, and the sun seems to shine directly on her beaming personality, one feels as if he's watching a vintage musical made by the Arthur Freed unit at the M-G-M of the 1940's.  But \\"Hairspray\\" is also a musical with a social conscience, satirical references, and a leading lady who is actually a man.  If such a concept had been pitched to L. B. Mayer during the Golden Age of the Hollywood musical, he would have called the mental ward demanding that men with nets be sent over to whisk the pitcher away.   \\"Hairspray\\" is a film with enormous spirit, brimming with  enthusiasm, laced with great, funny moments, and with a political/social message at its core.  Yes, in a musical.   Set in 1962 Baltimore, the film focuses on Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), a plus-size teenager who counts the endless minutes until school is out for the day and she can rush home to watch and dance along with \\"The Corny Collins Show,\\" a local afternoon rock `n' roll dance program in the \\"American Bandstand\\" mold.  Tracy and her pal Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) shake it up in front of the TV, getting excited about the new moves they see performed on the show.   With her attention reserved for this iconic TV program, Tracy daydreams in class and is finally sent to detention, where she sees the black kids dancing in ways she's never seen before.  Seaweed (Elijah Kelley) welcomes her and shows her some snappy moves.      The film eventually settles into its main plot:  Tracy becomes an unstoppable force in integrating \\"The Corny Collins Show,\\" so that the white kids and the black kids can dance together.  In the Baltimore of 1962, this isn't easy.  Her biggest obstacle is the owner of the TV station, former beauty pageant queen Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer), a Dragon Lady control freak who makes sure her own daughter, Amber (Brittany Snow), a danceron the show, gets most of the camera time.   \\"Hairspray\\" is filled with full-throttle performances by James Marsden (Corny Collins), Zac Efron of \\"High School Musical\\" fame (Link Larkin, the TV show's heartthrob), Allison Janney (prune-faced Prudy Pingleton, Amber's mom), Jerry Stiller (Mr. Pinky, owner of a clothing store for large women), and dancing spitfire Little Inez (Taylor Parks).   The film also benefits greatly from the presence of Queen Latifah as Motormouth Maybelle, Seaweed and Inez's mom and the owner of a local record shop.  Queen Latifah brings her expansive charm to a role that calls for Maybelle to brook indignities in order to get a foothold for herself and for blacks in general in a still-segregated era.  That she retains her dignity and comes off as more morally grounded than those in charge makes Maybelle the poster girl for a society in the throes of sweeping social change.  When she sings, the melodies are hot, the lyrics cutting.    Despite this abundance of on-screen talent, the character that steals the show is Tracy's mom, Edna, played by John Travolta in fat suit and house dress, pancake make-up and wig.  Traditionally, this role has been played by a man -- Divine in the original John Waters film, Harvey Fierstein on Broadway, and now Travolta.  Make no mistake, though.  This is no mere one-note drag act.   Edna is a laundress who works at home.  Her ambitions are modest, her self-image sad.  She loves Tracy, but like her fellow Balimore-ites, she holds traditional values and doesn't want to upset the apple cart of society.  It takes Tracy's dedication to her cause and her outrage at inequality for Edna to come out of her shell.  Watching Travolta, you soon accept him totally as Edna.  He's funny, but not merely a caricature.  Edna's a real woman we come to like immensely, both for her imperfections and for her ultimate willingness to open a closed mind to new ideas.       When Tracy persuades Edna to leave the house for the first time in years, Edna blossoms as she buys a new wardrobe, has her hair done, and dances through the streets in \\"Welcome to the 60's.\\"  This number is absolutely wonderful, suggesting the euphoria of Gene Kelly's dance in the rain and Astaire's tapping on walls and ceiling.  Travolta moves all of that padding with grace, giving Edna elegance.  Her physical emergence from moth to butterfly is also the beginning of her social awakening.   Christopher Walken plays Tracy's dad, Wilbur, owner of a gags and jokes shop.  The one number he performs -- a duet with Travolta, \\"(You're) Timeless to Me,\\" is disappointing.  Walken can dance.  If you don't believe me, check out his amazing solo in \\"Pennies From Heaven.\\"  Here, though, he looks awkward as he tries to negotiate Edna's wide girth.  On Broadway, the number was a showstopper -- a vaudevillian soft shoe amid the frenetic rock `n' roll tempos.  In the film, the number falls flat, even though Travolta does his best to sell the solid bond between Edna and Wilbur.    Director/choreographer Adam Shankman has moved the film along briskly and staged exciting dance sequences.  His choreography showcases the dancers' expertise as it channels 60's rock `n' roll dance moves and simultaneously incorporating snappy Broadway pizzazz.        Rated PG, \\"Hairspray\\" will put a  broad smile on your face.

B000VDDDY6|4.0|When I first saw an episode of the HD Star Trek I could't wait to get it on DVD. It was everything I expected...but too much. I am not a fan of the combo DVD/HDDVD discs (Hence the 4 stars not 5). I feel like I have to use kid gloves to avoid scratching 1 side (which I did first day). To see The Original series with the remastered and enhanced effects made it worth purchasing thou. The bonus features could have been a little better thou, I was expecting a bit more behind the scenes stuff with the HD aspect giving more room for additional material. All in all, this is a great item for a die hard Trekker and entertaining for a first time watcher. I sit in anticipation for Season's 2 release!!
B000UBMWG4|3.0|Amazing Blu ray edition.  But the packaging is poor.  The discs slide came loose in shipping and slid around inside the blue plastic tray and got scratched.  It will be near impossible to watch every bit of all 5 discs to see if the scratches effects playback.  Poor packaging Warner.
0765348276|5.0|Old man's war is truly a great read in the same league as Card, Heinlein, etc. Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down -- if you liked Ender's Game, you will love this book.     Most impressively, Scalzi's writing is timeless. He manages no to lock himself into the current era and leave most of the technology ideals open. I was so impressed that I bought the sequel straight away.
B000ASDFJU|2.0|I went through 3 of these and they were all defective. Season 3 disc 2 would not play on any set. I just sent the 3rd back and bought each season individually. I was VERY disappointed because the packaging is beautiful. I love the box! I really wish it had worked. HBO was no help at all when I contacted them about it. Amazon, of course was extremely helpful and nice but they did not want to send out a 4th box and I don't blame them!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Rush's newest album Snakes and Arrows is a must for all Rush fans and was released in May of 2007.<br />After the sonically impaired Vapor Trails (which was a very good record musically but not their best sonic-wise) and the looking back vibe with Feedback, bass player and singer Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer/lyricist Neil Peart come back in 2007 with Snakes and Arrows.<br />The band decided to add some new blood into the production assistance bracket and enlisted Nick Raskulinecz (known for previous work with The Foo Fighters) and recorded the best Rush record IMHO since Counterparts.<br />Many fairweather fans will complain that the band is not recording 2112 2 (Mad as Hell) or Moving Pictures 2 - The Second Coming. They are not Meat Loaf doing Bat Out of Hell sequels, they are a band who moves forward and changes with each album.<br />The reason for alot of acoustic guitars helping in the songs was that Lifeson had a conversation with Pink Floyd's David Gilmour about writing songs with acoustic guitars as opposed with electric guitars. Gilmour told Lifeson that the best way to write music is with acoustic guitars and I guess it worked as the songs are superb.<br />The opening track \\"Far Cry\\" is a killer rocker. What a choice for a single and the best album opener since Test For Echo's title cut IMHO. Next is \\"Armor and Sword\\" which is another stellar rocker, this time in a mid-tempo vein and another great song. \\"Workin' Them Angels\\" follows and is another excellent number and Alex's mandola/mandolin solo here reminds the listener of the solo on \\"Half the World\\" from 1996's Test For Echo. Next up is \\"The Larger Bowl\\" which its lyrics speak of one of Peart's infamous bicyling adventures through Africa in the 1990s. Lifeson plays some acoustic guitar during the verses and rocks out on the choruses. \\"Spindrift\\" follows and features a very catchy hook that refuses to be forgotten and is another stellar song. Next is the first of three instrumentals \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" which is their lengthiest instrumental since 1978's \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" and has the band pulling out some more musical tricks.<br />\\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" is perhaps Rush's bluesiest blues rocker ever. Lerxst playing some fiery solos here and the band sounds superb. \\"Hope\\" follows and is an excellent acoustic instrumental by Lifeson. \\"Faithless\\" is next and is another great song and features orchestrations by Ben Mink (whom last appeared on a Rush album with 1982's Signals playing electric violins on \\"Losing It\\") and a superb Lifeson solo. \\"Bravest Face\\" follows and is another great rocker. \\"Good News First\\" is next and is another stellar piece and an upbeat rocker. \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" follows and is a short but superb instrumental (now nominated for a Grammy). We close with the rocker \\"We Hold On\\" which is an excellent piece.<br />I have listened to the album all the way through FOUR TIMES already in 24 hours and is my pick for album of 2007.<br />RECOMMENDED!usiness\\" which is their lengthiest instrumental since 1978's \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" and has the band pulling out some more musical tricks.   \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" is perhaps Rush's bluesiest blues rocker ever.

B000VWYJ86|1.0|Simultaneously breathtaking and stomach churning. This is a movie that begins like a nightmare and ends with a headache. Aside from some nice overhead establishing shots the overall effect is like having your eyes dialated. Wham bam crash bang he's on the run and its over and thats the sum of this \\"awesome\\" movie. What an idiotic way to make a film.
0316779237|4.0|A great short-read for anyone who is looking for some laughs.  I'm a huge David Sedaris fan and although this isn't his best it sure has some hilarious moments.
0439882826|5.0|I bought this book for my grandson for Christmas. I realized when it was opened that he was way too young for it but, to my surprise the ooohs and ahhhh's from the other family and friends that had gathered prompted me to take a second look. It was hard to get it away from them, but I managed. The detail, the pop up within the pop up within the pop up was just jaw slacking. No one put that book down all night. Even though they all got many interesting gifts and expensive presents, it was this book that brought everything to think, talk and share about Star Wars and revere this fine work of art.
B00005JOHC|5.0|Excellent box set for people who are ready to have a big laugh.  For a first season I would recommend this DVD to anyone.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|This is the one for the action movie lovers. The stunts are incredible! You will be glued to the screen for the whole movie.  Of course, that is the real appeal of the movie, because you must not pay attention to the details. For example, the bad guy is the closest to god any human being can ever hope to be.  He is capable of controlling anything from private building elevator cameras to the command center for the Navy planes.  But, as I said, if you really like explosions, car crashes and computer wizardry, this movie is for you.
B00004W510|5.0|This is the third time I bought this album; first in vinyl a long time ago, then in a CD, which got lost somewhere, so I rebought it because of Look out Cleveland and Jawbone.  Hadn't heard it in years; still their best studio album.  Like the Band???  Buy it.
B000000WI4|5.0|First, I'm grateful that John Lee spent the final years of his life sharing his music with the world. I'm not even going to get into an argument about whether this is \\"pure\\" JLH in light of the guest musicians. I challenge anyone to listen to \\"This Is Hip,\\" featuring Ry Cooder, and find fault. The same holds true for \\"Crawlin' Kingsnake,\\" with Keith Richards and Canned Heat's Larry Taylor. When this album came out in 1991 it was a very welcome blast of John Lee, who STILL didn't care what they allowed...he boogied anyhow. He was still full of attitude and rocked harder than most musicians half his age.

B00005JPTI|4.0|I AM LEGEND is a sci-fi disaster film that is another attempt at adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel back in the early `50's. The first adaptation being \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" (1964) with Vincent Price and the cheesy but entertaining \\"Omega Men\\" (1971) with Charlton Heston. Being a remake, \\"I am Legend\\" leaves a lot to be desired with the unpredictability factor. However, with the current evolution in CGI effects, expectations would be high. \\"Legend\\" is the one version bestowed with a huge budget.<br /><br />A cure for cancer based on the Measles virus of old has achieved partial success. While it does cure the lethal disease, it was one side effect; it mutates human beings into vampire-like creatures that feed on human flesh. Military scientist Robert Neville (Will Smith) is left alone in New York with only a German Shepherd for company, for 3 years he has been looking for a cure but to no avail. Slowly, he is starting to give in to the pressure of being alone and hopelessness begins to sink in. Now, as new survivors surface, Neville is caught by surprise and finds a struggle within himself to remain optimistic in finding a cure or wonder if the human race has been snuffed out for good.<br /><br />The direction by Francis Lawrence (Constantine) is competent enough to handle this kind of project. The first half of the film shows Neville and his dog, Sam in their daily routine. They try to battle boredom and mental collapse by hunting deers, driving around the \\"ghost city\\" looking for supplies and even renting videos, hitting golf balls off the East River. It was smart for the director to establish a rendezvous point for potential survivors alongside the river at noon everyday. Neville's loneliness is also emphasized that he has set up a certain spot where he had arranged mannequins as an attempt to simulate a crowd. It was very considerate of the director to consider certain emotions that can creep in when one is isolated in large Empty City with certain creatures lurking in the night. Along with the very delicate link of sanity Neville has to his dog, one can wonder how long a man left alone can last. Certain situation studies have been explored before in films such as \\"Castaway\\". Luckily, Neville has more company with a dog than just a volleyball, the dog certainly had more charisma than \\"Wilson the volleyball\\". The past is also shown in flashbacks as to what happened to Neville and New York.<br /><br />The film's success also depends on how good the performance is of the lead actor. Will Smith has definitely matured as an actor since his days in \\"Fresh Prince\\". Smith's performance is pretty solid as the lead; while he mostly plays a reactionary role, he manages to express the needed emotions in the sequences that I felt his fears, thoughts and loneliness. Sure, there is still the usual snappy charisma that has become his trademark but he manages to sidestep that image and pulls off a very good performance.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect. There is a HUGE plot hole in the beginning of the last act, Neville's meeting with a survivor seemed so convenient that it's almost far-fetched. The \\"Dark Seekers\\" have that charcoaled-grayish-dehydrated look that seemed a little fake. (I thought I was watching a Pang Bros. Horror flick for a moment). Thankfully, the characteristics of the creatures are more interesting; they are stronger and faster than the zombies in 28 DAYS LATER, and to make things worst for Neville, they are a lot smarter. This intelligence was displayed with their observance of a \\"pack leader\\" and the ability to learn and imitate what they have seen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film didn't have the guts to follow through with its dark premise of pure despair of a lonely man in large city. It opted to settle for the usual heroics and while the film did have some emotional and intense sequences that redeemed it, it went on the direction of faith and Catholicism. While there may be nothing wrong in trying to emphasize human optimism and belief in a higher power, the conclusion was a little less satisfying and quite frankly, it collapsed in its predictability. \\"I Am Legend\\" carried a lot of potential but ultimately, it stumbles halfway through and lacked a very powerful climax. I am sad to say it fell just a little short of its truly majestic vision.<br /><br />Recommended!

B00026WU9Q|4.0|If you get a chance, you tube Subteranean Homesick Blues (spell it right, though, these reviews don have spellcheck!)---he invented the music video 15 years before MTV!  Don't like Dylan?  Then go soak your head!  (lol---Merry Christmas.)
B00005JPLW|5.0|i knew the movie was the best already but this dvd makes the movie experience 10x beter. if you're someone who likes action flix definitely buy it.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Rearly does a movie resinate with me like this one did.  I saw it in theaters twice and then couldn't wait until it came out on DVD.  Even after a few months of waiting I still felt this movie resinate with me as I watched it when I got it for Christmas.  It is both a Great and Original Movie.
B000VBJEFK|4.0|Great BluRay - apart for the 10mins of \\" loading & trailers\\" . Picture quality up there with the best & 24bit lossless sound !<br />Very well animated & mostly a great story & wonderful to watch. Maybe just 20mins too long, but very enjoyable & great purchase.
B000002P2W|4.0|Okay, I bought this as a record back in the 70's and there was the song \\"Squeezebox\\" and my friend Brian had this girlfriend Shelley, and we'd sing \\"Shelley has a squeeze box, Brian cannot sleep at night\\", being mature individuals, and now that I'm 50-something, I bought this disc to work out to tot ry and stave off middle aged-ness, and with the extra tracks, it was well worth it.  Especailly since music is cheaper than inflation---records were about $7 when I made $5 or $6 per hour; now that I make a whole lot more than that, discs are $10 @.  Well worth it.    merry Christmas!
B000J6I0PM|5.0|I like the companion cd.  All concert dvd's should have that.  How many times have you wanted to listen to the sound track on your mp3, or in the car   I
B000ICXQU6|3.0|This is a good movie. it shows how far a single mother is willing to work to provide for her family.    Amazon Unbox was easy to use and watch. I would tell anyone to just rent the videos. The reason for this is Amazon is uing 2 channel audio and standard deff.
B00005K9LM|4.0|priest were one of the most consistant metal bands ever.you knew that you were getting some quality music every time you got a priest disc.from rocka rolla to defenders of the faith it`s all good, after that your on your own
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I loved Dylan, and thought that for the first fifteen years or so he was up there with the Stones and the Beatles.  Then, between the parkinsons and whatever else, he got too hard to understand.  I bought the 30 anniversary live album and was sorely disappointed.  My friend burned this for me, and I liked it so much I had to buy it.  (It was the first time I ever got an album that I didn't pay for, and basically think that it's unethical).  Surprisingly, it led to my buying the Alicia Keys album.  (My grandfather lived in hells kitchen, too.  If that makes no sense, you haven't heard the first track.)
0743233832|4.0|Here in this book are the age old ideals and philosophies that inspired great peoples throughout the world and many of those who faught for and formed the foundations of America.  These are not new ideas, even at the time of this rulers ponderings, but are concepts that have been handed down by the wisest of individuals in one form or another from time immemorial.     If only we the frail creatures of Gods providence would walk towards this wisdom, rather than away from it as we seem to be doing these days, we would be more capable of addressing the problems that face our world and our nation better.  Unfortunately our two party system of government requires that one side be totally apposed to these great thoughts and concepts and \\"We The People\\" have to deal with both sides being at odds on just about everything important and in the end both are right and both are wrong on scores of issues.    This happens because everytime the modern day scholar (nearly all of them) attempts to interpret these wonderful concepts of old, they forget to take into account the thought processes and conditions of those who wrote them, and instead look with eyes blinded by their own feeble twentieth and twenty-first century concepts, ideals and minds.  They do not have a real tinme sensitive basis upon which to raise above their own egos, partisan thoughts and special interest prejudices and see clearly the significant meanings behind the great thoughts presented to them.  This is not only in reading Marcus Aurelius but the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States and the writings of our Founding Fathers and Mothers.     This is an excellent book, masterfully put together, for the individual to look inwardly and make adjustments to his or her soul that will enable him/her to be a better person, spouse, father, sibling, friend and citizen. It can bring inner peace to those who have nothing but constant turmoil of spirit.    It is unfortunate that this wisdom isno longer being taught to our children.  I certainly never was exposed to this by any instructor I ever had, in any form in primary or secondary education nor my college work. It was only through an innate desire to read everything I could get my hands on both politically and philosohically that I found and ordered this book.    One finds a quiet peace after reading this book and pondering it's contents and I would recommend it to anyone who yearns for a higher understanding of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness so inculcated and enshrined in the founding philosophies and documents of our nation.        Cetainly a great book to be readily available for reference.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|If you have never seen this movie, it is a must see. There has never been one to match it. Great Christmas day movie.    Amazon Unbox was easy to download and watch this movie. I even hooked up my computer to my TV and watched it on my 46 inch Widescreen TV.
B00008QSAA|5.0|I have to agree this has to be the BEST Leslie West and MOUNTAIN put out.  Two songs I think are sorely overlooked are SITTIN ON A RAINBOW and SILVER PAPER. Catchy lyrics, raunchy rock guitar riffs, and the overall structure and sound of these two tracks are classic MOUNTAIN staples standing on their own, which I feel are often overlooked or even ignored.    Of course, MISSISSIPPI QUEEN and NEVER IN MY LIFE are the best songs   MOUNTAIN wrote, in my opinion.  From the start those two tracks hypnotize you and grab your attention, heart-body-and soul.    Bottom line, the best music is in the ears of the listener, and to this reviewer's ears this CD is a must have for any pure ROCK N ROLL lover.    T. ROY TAYLOR
B00028U6B8|4.0|I guess it was 1970 or so, and I went to visit my brother at NYU, and I bought this and Led Zepplin 2. which were the first 2 albums I ever bought. I never would've thought that JA would have been a lost band, because they were huge back then, and for good reason! They were really good, and this was their best album, although the backgorund of the Vietnam War and Woman's lib is lost, they were really good, and this was perhaps their best.  Like 70's music...try this one for size.
0898159156|5.0|This is by far the best book available for growers of carnivorous plants from beginners to advanced growers. It is full of detailed growing instructions about each species in addition to general rules for growing these plants. The pictures are great and there is a lot of essential detail about their native habitats. In addition D'Amato has included a great deal of interesting background on natural history and cultivation. In short, this book is an absolute must have for anyone interested in growing these plants and I cannot recommend it enough!
0743496728|2.0|I don't read a lot of fiction and this book may be why. I just found it so trite and a stereotypical treatment of its topic. I also found the prose to be really stilted (sorry I returned the book to the library so I can't provide a specific quote, but I think there was a passage comparing a thought to a butterfly). I read the book because I am a teacher and the administrators in our building had read it as part of a security initiative this year. The story of bullying just did not ring true to my experiences.
B00005JPLW|5.0|The movie is excellent for those who've already seen it. The price I paid for a brand new two disc special edition was great.I buy from Amazon all the time..it beats retail stores.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|So, I pre-ordered it, seeing as how I was a big Springsteen fan since he was playing the bars in Asbury and I was at Rutgers in the mid-70's, and then I bought it again when I was buying music.  No prob, it was my secret Santa gift at work, as I work with a bunch of Jersey guys; put it in with a bunch of drink mixers, and what could be better than mixing some rum and mojito mix (unless you're a man, like me, and mix scotch and water), then putting on the boss while the wife has a mojito or three, and pretending we're 17 again.  Good album.
B000YABYSS|5.0|It was the one of the best movie I saw all year. Forrester & Denzel and all the young actors were superb and story line was a movie all should see. A True story,  but Denzel makes it come alive ever more .He should be Director of the Year. Supporting actor award to Forrester. This will be up for many Academy Awards . There hasnt been a movie of this caliber in a long time. This a about truth,morality,justice,the power of words, never giving up and helping others grow no matter what the odds and your shortcomings that some we have no control of but society has let become a cancer. This movie had all the emotions in humankind. Also, we hopefully have moved past the racial theme and see the movie for it beauty of how we as human move forward and make this country, your family and this world the way God intend us to grow in whatever your journey has taken you and be a overcomer . But know who is really control no matter .It will teach us to use debate of non violent and make that way to make change then violence that will only bring more violence. This will resolve to change whatever it may be. Then we see both sides of a issue so we can make each of us what is the right thing that can get us to see who we really are in the mirror and debate is a civil way to get to the truth. everyone in this movie and was part of it . It was blessing to all of us and to G-d who has given His Word. This could be the Academy award for Best Movie.
B0000AQS6R|4.0|Here it is, Christmas time again.  In addition to the egg nog and rest of the season, it is time to watch Christmas Vacation for the umpteenth time.  I actually struggled over how many stars to give this film.  Let's face it, the movie is not Casablanca; however, it is just so hilarious in parts, that I can't help but be entertained.  There are some hilarious moments in this film.  These go hand in hand with some of the more inappropriate and gross jokes and sight gags.  There are also a couple of downright poignant moments like when Clark AKA Sparky is up in the attic watching old home movies.  There have been many pretenders; such as the recently awful Deck the Halls, but for the true Holiday comedy classic, you can't go wrong with Christmas Vacation.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I had to check my order date, it came before I even started looking for it. It was in perfect condition. Great to do business with.    thanks
B000Q6GUT8|4.0|This play is the best film in a long time, if your looking for action and what a sniper is really capable of doing. Not as much action as The Bourne ultimatum but close. You haved to admire the skill involved in the characters screen play.  The action pack and the script will definitly be enjoyed by most military personnal, just for the nature of understanding the weapons, and what it takes in training a sniper. For the record there is violence and blood.  If action and tehc is your thing you might find this is one to watch.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have never liked regular earbuds; they don't stay in well (my ears are often too small) and are uncomfortable. However I don't want big bulky headphones either. These are perfect: lightweight, comfortable, stay in well, and very inexpensive. They are a little flimsy, but as long as you don't abuse they they should be fine. I've used them for some light excercise but have yet to use them for more. I spent a bit of time picking out headphones as I am picky with them and these were a great choice    Overall: highly recommended and great deal
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I came across this by chance a few days ago and picked it up and put it back down. After thinking for a few minutes I thought \\"why not?\\" and bought it. I was reluctant to watch the colorized version, but thought it would be fun just once and then watch the black and white from then on. When I was young I saw movies that Ted Turner had colorized with his \\"crayons\\", as Orson Welles called them, and was not to sure about this. Those movies were more or less a novelty of the 80's, something made fun of on \\"The Simpsons\\". As soon as the opening credits began though I became intrigued. This is an updated digital colorization version, not the horrible 1980's version. I was pleased with the results. I had never noticed the details in this movie, for example all the Coca-Cola signs in Gower's drug store, or the patterns on the wallpaper in the houses. The other reviewers made a good point, this movie looks like it was made in color during the 1940's. And for all the purist out there, it does include the best black and white version I have seen as well. So give it a chance, although Christmas is about over, there is always next year.
B000ANVQ0K|3.0|I was probably one of the last people to actually see \\"Titanic.\\" Just one of those flicks my friends had all seen before me. After seeing it, I understood all the hoopla, so I won't go into the redundant details. However after seeing it several times- indeed, umpteen times (I bought the video)- everything about this movie grew hammier, more predictable, and even anachranistic in certain ways- attitudes and acting. This movie gives you all you pay for. But after all is said and done, you have a lot of 21st century attitude blended in with early 20th century characters and their mindsets. That setting works in giving you who you sympathize with and who you loathe, especially when it comes to crunch time, and towards that end this movie works well. But there's a lot about this movie that is very over rated, especially most of all Gloria Stuart's performance. Billy Zane gives us an over the top role as Rose's fiance. His performance is cliched, but effective in who you sympathize with. And there are several other roles like that. So to be fair, the movie works. But is it the \\"second coming\\" as it was purported to be when it came out? Hardly. Great movies withstand the test of time, mega-viewings. This one doesn't fall into that category. It's a beautifully made film that tells a nice story. But this movie in no way belongs up there with the \\"Godfathers\\" and \\"Citizen Kanes\\" of the world, nor do the performances. It's funny how in the immediacy of things some movies get by the test of common sense and unfettered judgement. Awards get handed to movies like that, waaay too often. Best picture? Shows why the Oscars have long lost their significance (am I the only one who feels that those who vote on the Oscars should at the very LEAST go and actually SEE the movies!). The fact that this soundtrack sold so many copies shows how people lost their senses while riding the bandwagon. \\"Near, far, wherever you are??\\" Those lyrics won an award. This movie is good. In several respects, it's incredible. The recreation that is pulled off is worthy of praise, as is most of the cinematography. But that's where the hindsight praise ends. That was like the shine on the new car you were looking at. Once that sheen wore away, the true colors were revealed. For example, I personally think Kate Winslet's performance in \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is far superior to that of Titanic's. It's not a bad movie. But that's not the type of endorsement I buy a DVD on.
B000NIWI9K|5.0|I picked up this dvd several months ago and it quickly became my favourite dvd of my favourite opera.  There is so much that has to be considered for the wonderful balance that Mozart created here.  From the all important ensembles down to the solo numbers everthing here works beautifully, sung by and appropriately youthfull cast and staged by Glyndebourne with a refreshing faithfullness to Mozart and DaPonte.
B000002TQV|4.0|I agree, the most underrated of the albums from radiohead, I just got really into them a year ago, having listened to them for years since my brothers have been into them for years, but never really heard this album(which is surprising). I would definitely recommend this to people JUST getting into radiohead, for the main reason that this is kind of user friendly, but still has the hard edge of radiohead. And the next album I would say to a user to listen to is the new album In Rainbows...but let me get back to this album.    Every track is definitely rockier and just great to listen to loud..and I think the best tracks have to be The Bends, Planet Telex, Fake Plastic Trees, Just, My Iron Lung, and the beautiful Street Spirit( Fade Out). Each one of these to me are 10/10, but the other tracks are great as well. I think this album definitely should have got more recognition, because I think this definitely shows what they are capable of producing, which is meaningful, beautiful, and classic music.    Great Job Radiohead for sticking around and never giving into pop culture....well maybe Pablo Honey was generic, but that was your first album.
0805079831|5.0|Naomi Klein's Shock Doctrine is a unique kind of page-turner because the material is original, well-researched, engagingly written and/but is neither fiction nor about making you feel good (quite the opposite, actually).    Klein's thesis is that free-market leaders require 'shock-therapy' for the successful implementation of their policies which open up previously protected countries and communities to the ravages of profit-hunting multinationals. Shock and awe at the start, shock and repression throughout, so people won't know what hit them and even if they did, they can't respond effectively (at least not if they're imprisoned or quietly disappeared).    She deconstructs the work of Miton Friedman, Jeffrey Sachs (now this was a surprise), Putin's administration, the United States government, etc. to show how privisation, deregulation and free trade (the basic ingredients of economic neo-liberalisation) are usually preceded by a nation-numbing crisis, e.g. revolution, hyper-inflation, tsunamis', hurricanes, and, of course, 9/11.    If such catastrophies are not forthcoming 'naturally', they can be virtually manufactured (as in the case of General Pinochet and his Chilean coup d'état). Even more severe is the use of torture and repression to ensure that such policies work. Sharp price increases, lay-offs, dismantling of unions and increased foreign competition hit the poor hardest and tend to benefit the rich. Needless to say, the poor we'll always have with us (John 12:8) and have them in greater numbers. Hence, the need for draconian measures to 'obtain' the people's consent.    Why? Because the 2nd and 3rd World are the new untapped markets for the behemoths of globalised markets and no way they'll sit by and let locally (and fairly) elected governments circulate the wealth within their own people by limiting foreign involvement (what an anti-market idea!).    \\"The movement that Milton Friedman launched in the 1950s' is best understood as an attempt by multinational capital to recapture the highly profitable, lawless frontier that Adam Smith, the intellectual forefather of today's neoliberals, so admired - but with a twist.    \\"Rather than journeying through Smith's 'savage and barbarous nations' where there was no Western law, (this) movement set out to systematically dismantle existing laws and regulations to re-create that earlier lawlessness. And where Smith's colonists earned their record profits by seizing what he descibred as 'waste lands' for 'but a trifle', today's multinationals see government programs, public assets and everything that is not for sale as terrain to be conquered and seized - the post office, national parks, schools, social security, disaster relief and anything else that is publicly administered.\\" (p.239-240)    The book begins with something like 30 pages detailing the history of shock therapy as a torture method used on patients and prisoners. The idea is that in order to heal a person's psychological problems, we must first wipe clean the person's mental slate. The sense of self and time must be cancelled out. Kinda like hard-drive formatting.     And how do we do it? Electroshocking, sense-deprivation and, for interrogation purposes, torture. Best of all, these methods were distributed and taught by the CIA (we can see their declassified documents at the U.S. National Security Archive).    This physical process is that used as a template for national jolting and remaking. One thing I loved about the book was the quick and engaging lesson in geo-political history from SOuth America to South Africa to Asia-Pacific and even Israel.    Klein also devoted whole chapters to the States' Homeland Security policy and its 'War On Terror' in Iraq, both of which were construed as gigantic privatisation efforts, a radical creating of new markets but also a heinous and immoral transfer of wealth from tax-payers to powerful companies.     The steady heart-beat of the book is the exploitation (or manufacture) of nation-wide shocks, the closed-door cahooting between government, military and corporate big-boys (what Klein calls the corporatists) to suppress democracy and promote multinational interest. Yet this consistent pulse by the sheer breadth of its supposed explanatory power inevitably invites questions: Were all cases of 'socialist democracy' (the kind Klein implicitly advocates which gives priority to government control of major industries) successful and substantially free of repression and huge inequality? What would she recommend to achieve the 'end of poverty', assuming Sachs' ideas are out? And what are her views of Sachs' 'clinical economics' (as I don't recall her championing any specific anti-poverty measures)? Is it true that government control of major industries, sustained regulation, majority ownership in the hands of locals and limited free trade are the way to go? How possible/realistic are such policies in a world economy as open and Webbed-up as ours? Is protectionism (even of the pseudo- kind) really the way of the 21st century? And how thin, or where, is that line between this and isolationism?    It would've been interesting to get her analytical views of how Singapore and Australia 'did it', with both having (relatively?) sound/strong economies yet also acting as bastions of Western multi-national interest.      Nevertheless, I think Klein has done it again. No Logo was like a grenade into the world of brands; this book is like a missile into free-market economics as we know it. This is Marxism reloaded, setting economic agendas at the forefront once again, firing at those who control the 'means of production' (and seek more of it), even taking pot-shots at religion (although her angst is directed more towards Bush-favoring Rapture-minded fundamentalists who also support the war; she does put in a good word for the liberation-minded priests in Latin America).     Because of this book, my earlier enthusiasm for writers like John Kenneth Galbraith (with their caution state interventionism and anti-conglomerate approaches) feels vindicated, after many years of reading hyped-out management gurus like Tom Peters (and their gogogo, market-is-God rhetoric and views). Instead of the JKRs' of today being archair, it seems that the TPs' (and even writers like Thomas Friedman of 'World Is Flat' fame) are naive and ignorant of how their work supports the repression of poorer/voiceless people and the pillaging of their local resources.    Which brings us to Klein's hopeful reporting of the initiatives taking place (esp. in South America but also, in the book, in Katrina- and tsunami-hit areas). Groups of people are organising themselves, bypassing the government and directly challenging the multi-nationals, and reclaiming/repairing the land and property that was theirs pre-shock. It was uplifting the read Klein's examples of Latin American farming and factory co-ops (shutting out American-based companies), Thailand's Moken people (encircling their tsunami-wrecked village with rope) and New orleans community leaders (cleaning up sewage and reopening schools, actions the US government seems in no rush to do). Communical recovery was about marginalised and tragedy-shocked people standing up and re-taking charge of their lives and land.    The book ends on a profound note, also relevant to religious folks obsessing about the return of God to whisk them away:    \\"Such people's reconstruction efforts represent the antithesis of the disaster capitalism complex's ethos, with its perpetual quest for clean sheets and blank slates...(communal recovery action is) inherently improvisational, making do with whoever is left behind and whatever rusty tools have not been swept away, broken or stolen. Unlike the fantasy of the Rapture, the apocalyptic erasure that allows the ethereal escape of true believers, local people's renewal movements begin from mthe premise that there is no espcae from the substantial messes we have createdand that there has already been enogh erasure - of history, of culture, of memory. There are movements that do not seek to start from scratch but rather from scrap, from the rubble that is all around.\\" (p.466)
B000SM7QUC|5.0|The title of my review says it all.  I don't usually give reviews, but this soundtrack is underrated.  Most people who buy the album but not the book may not get it and vice versa.  However, once reading into the mind of Nikki Sixx and hearing the soundtrack to his tortured life during a time of over indulgence, you begin to ynderstand all of what was going on in his mind, the pains, the desires of a love through a substance abuse problem.
B000683VI4|5.0|I was told about this movie. It's a love story like no other Ive seen!!! Ive seen this 5 times now and cry every time! Everyone who watches it with me ALWAYS cries.  VERY GOOD MOVIE!!!! Maybe even my favorite!  A.W.
B000WC3864|5.0|The  Film: The Evil Dead<br />Year Made: 1981<br /><br />The Package: 5 Stars. This review is for The Evil Dead Ultimate Edition released in 2007 from Anchor Bay. I received this in the mail and opened the box it was shipped in. I took out the box and after waiting and waiting since I had this on pre order back in November. WOW, What I now was holding in my hands was the ultimate edition of one of my all time favorite horror films ever! I opened it up slowly and was so happy with what I was feasting my eyes on.  The box is very well made and the box graphics are so sweet! Inside you will find 3 discs.  Each one has some superb graphics on the discs themselves.  They are easy to pop out from the holder, and when put back in they hold in place very well.  You also get a poster inside that you can hang on your wall, OR if your a purist like myself, you can just leave it in the box to stay nice and in original condition as well.  On one disc you get a widescreen version of the film.  On the second disc you can watch the full frame version.  On the third disc there is lots of sweet extras that is sure to please any Evil Dead fan!<br /><br />Spook Meter:  5 Stars.  This film is creepy! The way it was shot, the forest, the cabin, the lighting, the sounds of the demons! It's freaky and just amazing. This is a absolute classic horror film that never fails to make my mouth drop open in awe every time I watch this!  Ladies, I think you all rock, but Lynda is my favorite demon.  That laugh of hers is just freaky as hell. LOL.  All and all I would say there is a handful of horror films that you watch and they are not only scary but you watch them and afterwards you think.  It just could not have been better made then this. The Evil Dead IS one of those films. Yes, it is really that exciting to watch.<br /><br />Gore/Violence Meter: 5 Stars. There is tons of flying blood/goo and all sorts of parts. If you love gore, you will love this.  The very first time I watched this, I was in total aww at that one body could hold that much blood. The gore really works well here.  Some films, less gore is better, in this case I loved to see the blood fly and it does. Even though there is tons of gore here, this is a fun film to watch and it won't leave you walking away feeling emotionally drained like some other horror films can do.  Not saying that's a bad thing from other films, but what I'm saying is, there is tons of gore here but it's truly fun to watch and not in a intense depressive way at all.<br /><br />Profanity Meter:  3 Strikes. There is some language here and there.  Gods name is used which I never like to hear in any film.  Other then that, there is not a lot of swearing.<br /><br />Sexual Meter:  2 Strikes. Nothing really sexual as far as nude scenes in this.  However, I must point out that there is a \\"famous\\" scene where a woman is suggestively  sexually assaulted by tree branches in the woods that come to life.  Nothing to graphic is actually shown, but you do have a clear idea what happened.  I point this out to any new viewer to this film just to let you know what may or may not offend you.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: I first wanted to give a review of this gem of a horror film just in case someone new stumbled across The Evil Dead (Ultimate Edition) and never seen this film at all before.  With  that said, I just want to say that I'm happy that Anchor Bay has come out with this edition.  I know not everyone is happy with this film being Re-released time and time again.  I am happy though as to me this is not only one of the greatest horror films in history but also a film that I just love to collect on period. If they keep releasing these, I will keep buying.<br /><br />Thank you for reading and have a Merry Christmas! 2007y could hold that much blood. The gore really works well here.  Some films, less gore is better, in this case I loved to see the blood fly and it does. Even though there is tons of gore here, this is a fun film to watch and it won't leave you walking away feeling emotionally drained like some other horror films can do.  Not saying that's a bad thing from other films, but what I'm saying is, there is tons of gore here but it's truly fun to watch and not in a intense depressive way at all.      Profanity Meter:  3 Strikes. There is some language here and there.  Gods name is used which I never like to hear in any film.  Other then that, there is not a lot of swearing.      Sexual Meter:  2 Strikes. Nothing really sexual as far as nude scenes in this.  However, I must point out that there is a \\"famous\\" scene where a woman is suggestively  sexually assaulted by tree branches in the woods that come to life.  Nothing to graphic is actually shown, but you do have a clear idea what happened.  I point this out to any new viewer to this film just to let you know what may or may not offend you.     Final Thoughts: I first wanted to give a review of this gem of a horror film just in case someone new stumbled across The Evil Dead (Ultimate Edition) and never seen this film at all before.  With  that said, I just want to say that I'm happy that Anchor Bay has come out with this edition.  I know not everyone is happy with this film being Re-released time and time again.  I am happy though as to me this is not only one of the greatest horror films in history but also a film that I just love to collect on period. If they keep releasing these, I will keep buying.       Thank you for reading and have a Merry Christmas! 2007
B00005M91K|2.0|Baraka contains many memorable and poignant images; but in his efforts to find spiritual commonalities amongst vastly differing cultures the director only manages to evoke a constant stream of mindless drivel. From a dread-locked Indian Saddhu suddenly jumping to Hasidic Jews praying at the Western wall in Jerusalem, or slo-mo action shots of Mexican foundry workers then to haunting echoes of Auschwitz in Poland makes it all seem like pointless dreaming. The orthodox Buddhist might call this the product of a butterfly mind, fluttering and flitting all over, however good the editing! By the end I was completely exhausted, even drained of emotion. I still could not work out the central point of the movie, is there a message or something? The best thing for me was imagining what a brilliant time the cinematographer must have had visiting all these beautiful locations, spending all day just filming without a script.     Boring; complete lack of direction and meaning. How many people have acclaimed this movie with shimmering splendor yet would have difficulty identifying a poem by Rumi! National Geographic without the words.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This was a great mix of Garth's many top hits over the years and some new material.  Was well worth the price - I bought additional copies for Christmas gifts for friends.  I recommend it even if you are not a big Garth Brooks fan.
0743289412|1.0|I received this book as a Christmas gift in 2006.  I finished reading it on Christmas Eve 2007.  What a labor.  When did Scribner become a vanity publisher?  And to think Mr. King took the time to tell us how great his editor is.  What?   500 pages of BOOL and SOWISA and smucking.  I miss the good old days when I read Mr. King until long in to the night with no sensation of time passing at all.  I doubt he has anything left in the tank after reading this over long, uninteresting tome.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I am in my forties and I grew up learning all the songs in this movie from my parents.  I also remember this movie being on TV when I was a child in the sixties. It is a happy family movie and I love the Inn itself and always wanted the architectural plans.(I loved the design so much I wanted to build it one day)!     I love Bing and Fred and Marjorie Reynolds, however Virginia Dale does not seem to be a compatible dance partner for Fred Astaire--she does not appear to be as skilled a dancer. Marjorie Reynolds does a great job of dancing howeever, and she holds her own.       Yes, it is in black and white and I would love to see a color version and have been thinking that for years, however this DVD Special Edition has much more clarity than my old VHS tapes. Fabulous Movie!
B000CPWDO4|5.0|I used to frequent a shady bar back in the UK about 30 years ago and the DJ had some great music - stuff from Chicken Shack (Imagination Lady), Armageddon and Titanic stand out clearly.  Over time, I've found all of the great records the DJ played, except Charge! by Paladin.  Now it's available once again, albeit on a Japanese import with the liner notes in Japanese.  This version has many bonus tracks and variations, hence the higher cost than the regular vinyl-to-CD version.    Well worth the money, though finishing a search that has lasted so long may have colored my vision somewhat.  This is a great album and in it's way, groundbreaking, from a time that was much more experimental than the regimented spoon fed mass market tripe emerging now.
1573229725|5.0|It took me three weeks to read Fingermith, but I must confess I really enjoyed reading it. Developed in a very old-fashioned atmosphere,  Fingersmith caught all of the reader's attention to the main characters: Sue Trinder and Maud Lilly.<br />Sue Trinder, is an orphan that grows up in a house, full of fingersmiths (term used to designate  mean thief), raised by Ms Sucksby in London. An unscrupulous man commonly known as Gentleman invites Sue to join him to  his plot of  winning the heart of a naive, young heiress named Maud Lilly who is kept among books by her obsessive uncle. As part of the plot Sue is sent to a full of shades mansion in the countryside to serve as Maud's maid. Maud is the owner of a fortune but she can only receive it if she marries. The plot is that Sue will help Gentleman convince Maud to marry him. Once married they would send Maud to a mad house and both would share the fortune. However, things do not go as planned. Sue and Maud soon become close friends which develop into a mutual physical obsession.<br /><br />I think that one of the book merits is the rich language used by the writer and the way she set up things in such atmosphere that gets the reader really into the scene.
B000X5KSWM|4.0|So none of us will ever forgive Tarja for ignoring Nightwish... that said, this is an awesome CD well worth the money. It has the ornate (only word for it) vocals of the Nightwish work but without some of the more aggressive instrumentals. Given the history, the lyrics are hilarious (I Walk Alone... yeah, real subtle :P ) but it's still loads of fun.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Matt Damon has created a winning formula--nice guy becomes cold-blooded assassin, but still has a conscience; former lady boss at CIA is in turns sympathetic and exasperated; bad guys are all around, but especially at the CIA; Bourne is invincible--rarely using a gun, rarely killing anyone, but pulverizing anyone blocking his path. This time joined by Scott Glenn, Albert Finney and David Strathan, Bourne penetrates the secret of his past and how he became what he is today. With lots of neat spy tricks, techno-wizardry, car chases and martial arts, this third in the series is entertaining as ever. It's rated PG-13, but would scare younger kids, I think, so use your judgment.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas's debut album is lyrical genius.  This is the greatest rap album ever.  The way Nas deliver's his messages and stories told on this album are epic.  The beat, the flow, the words, nothing is considered inferior on this album.  Tracks to look out for are NY State of Mind, Life's a B****, Halftime.  If you are into rap, and you don't own this album, then you are no fan of rap.
0671646788|5.0|Have you been giving excuses for all your failures? Do you consider yourself as a pygmy? Do you always find faults with others? Are you dreaming about success and not taking any actions? If you have answered \\"yes\\" to any of these questions, this book is really for YOU.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book. David Schwartz corroborates his thoughts and suggestions with wonderful stories. You can apply his practical ideas even to change some of your perpetual habits. This book is really a motivation booster and forces you to get into action. It stimulates your positive thinking/attitude and alleges you not to make negative impressions about people/ideas/beliefs. The book affirms that successful people constantly involve in self-development.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to be successful and is looking for a motivation booster.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This movie's action is brilliant.  Also, the story and the narration is superb.  The visual effects should not go unnoticed.
630522577X|5.0|I highly recommend this movie.  Whether you love musicals or the classics, this is an oldie but goodie!. I laughed out loud, I enjoyed the song and dance numbers.  Good for kids and adults.  It definitely deserves its rank in the AFI top ten of all time.
0743201140|4.0|This book is excellent.  It motivates the reader to want to exercise those things that the reader already does well.  It stimulates that person to learn how to produce an excellent performance consistently.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|When we left Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) at the end of Spider-Man 2, he had not only revealed his identity as Spider-Man to Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but his love for her as well.  The third installment opens happily enough with MJ starring on Broadway and Pete about to propose.  Of course, sticky situations start popping up right away, beginning with a creeping tar-like substance from space that attaches itself to Peter, changing him from sweet Spidey to mean-spirited Black-suited Spider-Man.<br /><br />This would have been enough conflict to deal with for a very good movie, but, unfortunately, we are introduced to two new villains - Sandman and Venom, as well as pal Harry Osborn (James Franco)'s New Goblin.  The first two films had one villain to focus on, but this is too much; none of the story lines has a chance to develop and the movie gets too crowded and choppy.  Toss in the third retelling of Uncle Ben's death and Bryce Dallas Howard in a thankless role and we end up with a disappointing movie.<br /><br />We do get to see Tobey Maguire show a wider emotional range this time, which is good; he starts as the loveable geek and changes into a conceited and nasty guy who thinks he's a macho muffin, strutting down the street like John Travolta in \\"Saturday Night Fever.\\"  Dunst is fine as the long-suffering girlfriend and struggling starlet, and Franco gives a strong performance as the loyal pal turned arch villain.  Despite the quality of acting, I felt there were too many characters and subplots to keep track of and too much CGI, which makes it cartoony.  I give this least entertaining film in the series 3.5 stars - unnecessary subplots detract from the overall fun.
B000WMFZNS|5.0|After years of waiting, the epic 1961 film El Cid has been released on DVD. This film depicts the life of Rodrigo Valdez de Bivar, also known as El Cid, the national hero of Spain who led the revolt against centuries of Moorish rule. It tells a story of a reluctant hero, someone who does not wish to fight the Moors at first, but who becomes a revolutionary after suffering betrayal and personal loss.<br /><br />Produced by Samuel Bronston, directed by Anthony Mann, and starring Charlton Heston, this film is anchored by people who knew what it took to tell a grand, majestic story. This film is entertaining and enjoyable as an action adventure epic, as a historical film, and as a romantic movie.<br /><br />These kind of movies should never go out of style. Regardless of liberties taken with the facts or any other entertainment license, we are much poorer when we don't have movies like Braveheart, Gladiator, Spartacus, Taras Bulba, and El Cid. They thrill, entertain, and enlighten, and cause us to focus on ideals and principles greater than ourselves. Long live the Cid, and long live this kind of moviemaking!
B000VPUIA6|4.0|Over forty years have passed since the Beatles second film began life as  \\"Beatles Two\\" then \\"Eight Arms to Hold You.\\"  Finally, thank goodness, it  finally came to fruition in the incarnation we all know as Help!.  Directed  by Richard Lester and featuring a brilliant supporting cast, \\"Help.!\\" makes  its DVD debut in this deluxe version featuring script, picture book, lobby  cards, poster and the excellent film itself.  The deluxe version, though  very expensive in most people's budget, is nonetheless a cherished momento  for the serious Beatles fan.  The packaging is first rate, the video itself  is impeccably restored and it only takes a passing glance to see the care  and detail put into this superlative reissue.  I've seen the less-expensive version and though it is very well done, this deluxe version is a fitting document of arguably the Beatles most entertaining film.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I love this movie.  I know it does not sound P.C. to have rats in the kitchen but this is such a cute movie.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Visually stunning.  Well acted and directed.  A film worth watching again and again.<br /><br />Update 6/18/12 - since my initial review I have likely watched this film another 5 or 6 times.  The quality of the film is beautiful and holds up upon repeat viewings.<br /><br />I think one of the reasons I most appreciated this story is that I hadn't really been aware of it before the film.  Not being a history expert I can't speak it its accuracy, but from purely an entertainment perspective the story was beautifully told with good character development and of course a delightful love story :)
B000LW7UR8|1.0|Don't buy this CD.  The music is fine, but if you are anything more than a sheep you will not allow a record company and/or artist to decide for you what you can do with music that you purchased.  I bought this CD and was disgusted by the digital limitations.  I am not a criminal/pirate, yet I'm treated like one.  I will never spend another penny on this band or a Virgin Records release.
0920668364|5.0|I read this book to my children when they were in preschool. Then, as they learned to read themselves, they read it to me. It was the #1 thing on my daughter's birthday wish list this year as she turned 21, and we loved reading it together again now. I think I'll ask her to buy me a copy when I turn 80!
0811806405|4.0|A very good book that covers Acoustic and Classic guitars building in the same book, this is VERY useful and smart.<br />You can learn the differences and also to really understand how to make each one of them.<br />I gave him 4 stars because I would love to see color images! Not old black and white low quality photos<br />Thanks,<br />Yaron.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|This isn't punk rock - which is apparently problematic for fans of that genre.  But it is awesome.<br /><br />I would say that this is more along the lines of the Cure or Depeche Mode but with AFIs own touch ever present.<br /><br />It is an extremely fun and entertaining album.  I've had it for a long time and it still dominates my playlist in itunes.<br /><br />No DRM that interfered with ripping it so that I can listen on my pc, ipod, etc.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This release is beautiful, watching this film its hard to believe that its been 25 years since its release.  The film in 1080p is very nice, and the new version seems to flow so much nicer.   The making of video is very insightful and was fun to watch.      If you are a BR fan, or even if you are not this is a very nice version to get a hold of.
B00116FT6M|4.0|I downloaded this to my Tivo and had no problems with the download.  The picture quality was also quite good.  I knew the premise of the movie, but I didn't know that Travolta was actually playing Mom in drag.  That truly made the movie.  I also thought Walken did a nice job as dad.  I am not much for musicals, but this was very enjoyable from start to finish.   I recommend it for a nice afternoon.
B000002J0B|5.0|This is my favorite album from Led Zeppelin and it contains one of their most beautiful song \\"The Rain Song\\" is simply amazing, there is so much emotion on this track.  Another great track is \\"No Quarter\\", a mysterious ambiance (My wife hate this one but I just love it !)    Dancing days and D'yer Mak'er are two good hits, you might have heard them before on your favorite fm rock station.  A must have album...again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As the title says, this in my opinion, was the best television series ever with the possible exception of Babylon 5. I can't believe how the Fox network screwed it up and then cancelled it prematurely. If there is one TV series you want to put on your shelf for viewing, this is it.
B000002GGU|5.0|This album stand the test of time, it contains no less than six hits, as far as I can remember they were hits !  \\"One night love affair\\", \\"Run to you\\", \\"Heaven\\", \\"Somebody\\", \\"Summer of 69\\" and \\"It's only love\\"  I don't know if \\"She's only happy when she's dancin\\" and \\"Kids wanna rock\\" were also played on radio at that time, if so, the total of \\"hits\\" is eight !  Can you imagine ? For sure, one of the best from Bryan Adams, if not the best.    A must have for any 80's pop rock music lovers.
0151013047|1.0|From the beginning Erica makes it clear that she does not desire a sexual relationship. In fact she is reluctant to have much of any kind of a relationship. The first time sex is attempted she regresses into the depression she has recently somewhat recovered from. The entire courtship is pushed by the author, showing his disdain for women and his belief that as a man what he wants is primary. He has little respect for Erica as a person, only to supply what he wants.    About his hatred for America and Americans: How are we Americans to feel about people who, in order to kill Benazir Bhutto, are willing to attach the bomb to a baby?
B000002J1U|4.0|More acoustic songs on this cd than what we have been use to by the band, but this is another very good cd.  Don't worry, they still rock hard, in songs like \\"Immigrant song\\" or \\"Celebration day\\".  They still can play blues too like \\"Since I've been loving you\\", but you'll discover the acoustic side of Lez Zep and once again, they're quite good there too !
B000YAA6AU|4.0|As hopelessly contrived and predictable as \\"P.S. I Love You\\" is, it's still a charming, touching romantic comedy. The most surprising thing about it is Hilary Swank, whose resume of serious films has made a humorous role seem an unlikely choice. She makes full use of her softer, sillier side, playing a character that's loveable and irritating at the same time. I say this in spite of the fact that serious undertones run through the film, as they always do in romantic comedies; after losing her husband to cancer, Swank's character spends the rest of the film trying to find herself (for lack of a non-clichéd term). The twist is that her husband is posthumously guiding her with a series of handwritten letters, all of which were so strategically located that only a well-executed plan could see it through. A sweet but nonetheless baffling idea: How could a terminally ill man carry off something this elaborate in such a short period of time?    Never mind--I was still moved by the light-hearted sentimentality of the story, so I have to give credit where credit is due. The film opens in wintertime New York City with Holly Kennedy (Swank) storming home, absolutely furious. Right behind her is her Irish husband, Jerry (Gerard Butler), who knows he's said something to offend Holly but doesn't know what. It isn't until they enter their apartment that they really let loose: Holly is offended because Jerry commented on her waiting to have children. Now back in their apartment, everything he says gets misconstrued in some way, and a full-blown fight ensues. It isn't long before they make up, however, and by the time they do, Jerry promises his wife that he isn't going anywhere, despite their financial troubles, despite their current job situations. After nine years, he still loves her. He'll always love her, no matter what.    Naturally, the very next scene takes place at his memorial service. The audience is thankfully spared the unnecessary melodrama of his failing health and eventual death; no such scenes are included in this film. The filmmakers wisely chose to focus on what happens afterwards with Holly, who--as you might have guessed--is so grief-stricken that she shuts herself off and lets herself go. It isn't until her thirtieth birthday that things begin to change; as her worried family and friends sit by her side, a birthday cake is delivered with a mini cassette recorder taped to the inside of the box. Holly presses the Play button and hears Jerry's voice explaining that he wrote her a series of letters as he was dying. Holly will receive them all over a period of time, and each one will instruct her to do something bold and adventurous. Basically, his words will push her into living her life without focusing so much on his death.    The rest of the film is all about Holly fulfilling her husband's last requests, from singing in a karaoke bar to meeting his parents back in his native Ireland (where--you guessed it--another letter waits). Her friends and family offer as much support as they can, all while engaged in their own minor subplots. Her best friend, Denise (Lisa Kudrow), is desperate to find Mr. Right, so desperate that she openly asks potential dates about their relationship status, their financial status, and their sexual orientation. Holly's mother, Patricia (Kathy Bates), loves her daughter but has trouble accepting Jerry's postmortem plan. She was never fully accepting of him to begin with; he and Holly married at young ages, meaning that a lot could have gone wrong. And Patricia definitely understands the pain of losing a husband (albeit under much different circumstances).    The most interesting side character is Daniel (Harry Connick, Jr.), who works for Holly's mother at a local bar. He claims to have a syndrome: his social filter is defective, meaning he'll say anything to anyone at anytime. He openly tells Holly that she's hot, that she's a terrible singer, and that he's getting sick of hearing about Jerry allthe time. Part of the truth is obvious--he has feelings for Holly. The rest of the truth is not so clear-cut--he, too, has been deeply wounded by a past relationship. From this alone, the two are emotional matches. That doesn't necessarily mean that they would work as a couple, especially with the inclusion of William (Jeffery Dean Morgan), the man Holly meets on her trip to Ireland. So the question is raised: Will Holly and Daniel find romance in the midst of tragedy? Will Holly allow herself to love again, or even to let her life go in a new direction?    As fresh and exciting as I'm making this sound, the reality is that \\"P.S. I Love You\\" is a fairly routine story of love, loss, and emotional rebirth. That doesn't make it a bad movie by any means; in all honesty, I found it quite satisfying. Most of this has to do with Hilary Swank, who impressed me with her ability to transcend the heavy-handed, solemn movie roles she's known for. But the rest of the cast does a decent job, as well, doing justice to a well-established cinematic formula. I also appreciated the letter-writing plot point, simply because it was cleverly (if strangely) executed. Some may feel that Jerry's letter writing is a method of control, but do you honestly think that a romantic comedy would go that far? It's not control so much as it's a way to nudge Holly in the right direction--I believe that, were it not for his letters, she would mourn the rest of her life. And is it any coincidence that he ends every letter with the film's title?
B000002JSJ|4.0|Another very good cd from Led Zeppelin.  Not easy for them to make a good follower to House of the Holy and Physical Graffiti, but they almost make it.  Still a very good one.  Achilles Last Stand is very good.  A good starter I can tell.  Nobody's fault but mine is a classic.    The hidden jewel goes to the last one, a beautiful song from Led Zep, Tea for One is an excellent song, well worth the discovery, in my mind, almost as good as \\"The Rain song\\"
B00005JPLW|5.0|Now if only they would make a movie with a similar theme of heroism involving the troops in Iraq or Afghanistan.  This movie is a classic tale of self sacrifice for the greater good, of being a part of something more than yourself and laying it all out on the line.  Honor, duty and heroism are celebrated virtues in this movie.  At times it seems to glorify war, but if you pay attention to the story (which is admittedly thin) you will realize none of this carnage would have had to happen if the establishment class of society weren't too busy thinking of themselves.    Without looking into the plot or themes too deeply, this is just an all around excellent film that is a blast to watch.  If it is entertainment you want, this is your film.    Edit (November, 2010):  So it looks like the director, Zack Snyder, has been tapped to reboot the Superman franchise.  I couldn't be happier with this news, this is a bright young director and though I would like to see him continue to put out more original work, if Superman can bring the same mainstream success to him which Batman brought to the brilliant Christopher Nolan, I am all for it.
B000002J09|5.0|All has been said about it (hey, nearly 1000 reviews at this moment)  Just a few lines to say that this cd is a must have for any  rock music fan.  I love Rock'n'Roll, it enegize me all the time I listen to it.   Going to California, Black dog and of course Stairway to heaven have their place in the hall of fame of Rock'n'Roll music !
B000007XUQ|5.0|Excellent production of the  Christmas message. Wonderful music.  A pleasure to listen to this CD.
B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zeppelin at its peak, this double cd is damn good from the beginning 'til the end.  Pure rock at its best. A jewel to discover.  Of course, you have the amazing and very well known \\"Kashmir\\" but the rest of this double cd worth the listening.  The more you'll listen to it, the more you'll like it !
B0002HN14I|4.0|There are many things wrong in the world which we live in; one of them is the fact that this concerto is so rarely played. As a devoted audiophile, I honestly can't think of a violin concerto that matches the emotional depth of Elgar's. In many ways, this is the greatest violin concerto ever written; it is technically and emotionally to the violin what Rachmaninoff's 3rd is to the piano. Having listened to renditions by Perlman, Menuhin, Heifetz, and Kennedy, I recently decided to give Hahn a try.     Hahn's version is the most intonationally accurate one out of them all, including Heifetz's. But her affinity for accurate playing is precisely her problem: she doesn't take any chances. Everything feels catered towards what's technically convenient rather than what's musically vibrant. Her tone is always smooth, her vibrato always consistent, but something feels lacking. She brilliantly flies through the technical passages of the concerto, particularly the final 2 minutes of the first and third movements. But it is during the intimate sections that she leaves the listener wanting more. There are no slides, shifts, or changes of vibrato which give you goosebumps. It's somewhat of a tragedy that such a gifted violinist did so little with such beautiful melodies. That being said, this concerto is such a great work in itself that a straight, ordinary recording such as this would still be worth the price.     For a unique and completely unordinary recording, I highly recommend the Heifetz recording. More so that any of the other violinists, Heifetz plays this concerto with an extremely great sense of taste. Every shift and slide has its own color and meaning. The virtuoso passages are played with fiery passion while the soft passages are played with vulnerability and delicacy. The best example of the latter is his final repetition of the D-E-F#-A-A theme in the cadenza. The way that he plays that one shift conveys deeper feelings than Hahn could ever express in 10 minutesof less-intellectual playing. This is not to denigrate her recording at all, but to point out just how unique Heifetz is.The one difference you will have to get used to is his brisk tempo. If you can get over this small difference and really listen for what he puts into the soft passages, this recording will pay off big time.     So to sum things up, if you don't have a recording of this concerto, GET ONE. If you already have one, get Heifetz's.

B000R7HY0K|4.0|**** 2007. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino who takes an inventory of all possible symbols dealing with the relation cars/women. You have to like cinema and be a movie buff to really appreciate this film. I just have to see it again. Right now.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I work in remastering music from vinyl to cd and needed another pair of headphones for my room with the turntable instead of draggin my MDR-V600s from one room to the next. So I asked Santa for a new pair of headphones and  looked up a website online with a pic of a pair of Sony headphones that looked close to what I already had. Wow! What a difference I was hearing even compared to my 100 dollar V600s! The cups have a nice tight fit and silence the outside far better than the V600s. The sound has MUCH more brilliance to it and cleaner bass...I may have to dig up some of my favorite cds now and see what I've been missing! I also may be looking for another pair of these now so I have them in both rooms! My only concern and disappointment is in the wire hanging from the sides of the phones, couldn't Sony embed the wires inside the headloom like the V600s? Just makes them look cheap in my opinion. You simply cannot go wrong in purchasing these phones.

B000009DUY|5.0|The long and exceptionally fruitful collaboration between director Steven Spielberg and composer John Williams reached an incredible high in 1998 with the release of Spielberg's epic World War II drama SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Few films that have ever delved into the fighting aspects of this, the last real all-out classic War, have ever been as honest, brutal, and blunt as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was.  And Williams understood this as much.    But whereas in decades past he might have turned on the bombast (as he did for the 1976 film MIDWAY), for SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, he goes for a combination of subtlety, poignancy, and stirring (but not over-the-top) patriotic anthems.  The score, performed under Williams' direction by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, features stirring contributions by principal trumpet soloists Tim Morrison and Thomas Rolfs and horn soloist Gus Sebring.  Of particular note is the now-famous \\"Hymn To The Fallen\\", which, like Williams' theme for SCHINDLER'S LIST, is considered to be a piece to be played at memorial services, especially since the 9/11 attacks.    And just like SCHINDLER'S LIST, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN shows that there is more to John Williams than the bold, spectacular scores he is known for.  That kind of diversity has always made him perhaps the most sought-after composer of Hollywood film music, and for a lot of good reasons.  This is a must-have for film score buffs in particular, but also music fans in general.
B000R5N1MC|4.0|difficult not to be impressed when you see such a package, and what package that is. Everything you could wish for if you are a Blade Runner fan. I have compared the different ultimate edition on different media and while there is no doubt about the quality of the HD Version being amazing, i believe they could have included some more goodies (for maybe a more expensive price) if you wanted a really ultimate edition. I am thinking about small things like adding the 25th Anniversary Soundtrack or adding the goodies from the Collector Set (the dvd version that came out in 2000) and finally maybe a poster or something framed, but the hologram included is already very nice for that matter. Don't get me wrong i really like everything inside that briefcase, it's just that there is no cherry on the Anniversary cake :).
B000002OR4|5.0|The collaboration between director Steven Spielberg and composer John Williams has been so associated with big, bold Hollywood scores that it's sometimes easy to miss the fact that this collaboration could produce music that was both subtle and sublime.  Such is the case here with the heartbreaking and poignant score that Williams composed for Spielberg's 1993 Holocaust drama SCHINDLER'S LIST.    Subtle and sublime, however, are just the words at the tip of the iceberg here.  Deep down, this music is every bit as heartbreaking and poignant as the film it goes with.  Utilizing a number of Jewish music motifs and the great violin work of the legendary Itzhak Perlman, Williams created a magnificent score that is never overbearing and is in keeping with the somber and harrowing nature of the film's subject matter.  The main theme has become as synonymous with mourning in our time as Barber's \\"Adagio For Strings\\", and with good reason.  But the entire score is a treasure to behold, well deserving of all the accolades it received, including one of the film's seven Academy Awards.    Brilliantly performed by the Boston Symphony under Williams' fine direction, the music to SCHINDLER'S LIST is one of the most powerful pieces ever composed for film, and an essential recording for film buffs and great music fans alike.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I've wanted to buy this DVD since I found out it was being released. I am a theater major and I've seen many productions of \\"The Sound of Music\\" over the years but have never gotten a chance to watch the movie version. I am also a big Julie Andrews fan (not the biggest though, I leave that title open for someone else to take) and have loved her work in Mary Poppins since I was a kid. I knew that she was a talented actress and singer and would not be disappointed in this movie. And I truely wasn't. It was beautiful to watch and made even better by the extras that were included on the second disc. I enojoyed watching Julie Andrews and Christopher Plumber talk about their time on set as well as watching the making of the movie with a visit from the real Maria Von Trapp. I would suggest this DVD collection simply because it is fantastic in every way and doesn't leave you disappointed.
0060794410|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed listening to every word of GOOD TO GREAT.  It taught us valuable lessons about business and about personal organization.<br /><br />The principles, which are based on years of scientific research, are valuable also in observing the business practices of major businesses we deal with.  Listening to this work gave us new insights into events we have heard on the news over the years.<br /><br />We found the detailed accounts of executives' lives valuable. The lesson is that self-centered activity defeats the growth of business.
0143038583|5.0|Michael Pollan's book on the way we eat today and the way we should be eating covers a staggering amount of ground. First, he tells the history of how one foodstuff, corn, has come to dominate the American diet, agriculture and food industry to an extent of which few of us are aware. Of course, political and market forces enter into the telling of this tale, and there is no doubt of where Pollan falls in the political spectrum; still, it is difficult to refute his charges of the harm that government price supports, monoculturing on a vast scale and industrial farming has wrought, given the news stories that have assaulted us in the past few years about mad cow disease, contamination scares and the emergence of virulent strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.<br /><br />He then takes a look at alternatives, demonstrating convincingly that the more successful so-called organic farming has become, the more it has come to resemble the industrial agriculture against which it was rebelling. There is no easy solution to sustainability, it seems. Pollan doesn't just talk the talk, he walks the walk, living and working with farmers and food producers who are trying to go back to more ecologically balanced, less environmentally harmful methods of food production. It's an uphill battle, but full of encouraging scenes, though one doubts that the small-scale operations Pollan so lovingly describes could be effectively reproduced on any scale large enough to transform American agriculture.<br /><br />In the final portion of The Omnivore's Dilemma he literally hunts and gathers a complete meal, which he then serves to his friends in a touching concluding tableau. I was educated,  enthralled and ultimately moved by this book, which brings together history, politics, ecology and agriculture in a sometimes discouraging, sometimes frightening, but always captivating chronicle that hammers home the point: we are how we eat.

B000VNMMQ6|4.0|\\"Live Free or Die Hard\\", a long anticipated sequel of John McClane'f films, the  Action / Adventure / Crime / Thriller is pure fun for its 130 minutes of run time. Almost twenty years after he single handedly (and barefooted) stood up against the group of ruthless international terrorists that held hostages, including John McClane's wife, Holly, in a Los Angeles skyscraper on one Christmas night, New York cop, tough guy John McClane is back. In the fourth \\"Die Hard\\" movie, McClane faces the biggest challenge of his career and the stakes are unbelievably high. In the first \\"Die Hard\\", the bad guys took over the building, in the second film, McClane was against a team of terrorists, led by Col. Stuart (Sadler) who was holding the entire airport hostage. In the third one a man calling himself \\"Simon\\" (Jeremy Irons) threatened to detonate bombs around New York City unless Detective John McClane cooperated in a game of \\"Simon Says\\". In the latest \\"Die Hard\\" installment,  low-tech McClane(\\"You're a Timex watch in a digital age\\", he's been told) is up against a ring of highly intelligent and dangerous Internet techno-terrorists who are very close to taking control of America's computer infrastructure, breaking in and shutting down all the networks, creating havoc and panic around the country in \\"fire sale\\". As the young hacker who happened to be on of the terrorists targets, explains, \\"It's a three-step... it's a three-step systematic attack on the entire national infrastructure. Okay, step one: take out all the transportation. Step two: the financial base and telecoms. Step three: You get rid of all the utilities. Gas, water, electric, nuclear. Pretty much anything that's run by computers which... which today is almost everything. So that's why they call it a fire sale, because everything must go.\\"<br /><br />Technical terrorists-geniuses thoroughly thought through every possible small detail of the vicious fire sale attack but they did not include in their plan one variable,  sarcastic, cynical, disappointed and wise cracking Detective John McClane who now works for Homeland Security. I loved the movie. It is a very decent entry in the \\"Die Hard\\" series. It is creative, the fights and explosions are spectacular, and the action sequences are full of adrenalin. John McClane is older, that's true but nothing can slow him down, and certainly not his age. When he is on the screen saving the day, his daughter, and  his  country, I know he would get every one of the bad guys, and I hope that he will be back - for another \\"Die Hard\\"  movie.<br /><br />\\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is the first movie I've seen on Blue-Ray disk and I was very impressed by the quality of the picture and the sound. Since I have not seen it in the theater, it is the next best thing. :)arcastic, cynical, disappointed and wise cracking Detective John McClane who now works for Homeland Security. I loved the movie.

0439882826|5.0|I bought this book for my 6 year old son, but I am also a Star Wars fan. I am not usually a fan of pop-up books, but the extremely positive reviews convinced me to make this purchase. My son and I were not disappointed. This is the most finely crafted pop-up book I have ever seen! The book includes all the major characters of the Star Wars saga, as well as spacecraft and supporting characters. The finale of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker with glowing lightsabers is a fitting ending page. Note that the pop-ups are extremely detailed, with very intricate and sophisticated folds, requiring a careful touch and patience to open and close carefully. Thankfully, my son loves this book so much, he is thoughtfully taking special care of it, while he carries it everywhere with him. I highly recommend this book for young Star Wars fans!
1400064287|5.0|10-word review: Excellent!  A bit like [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink]]; less surprising, but more useful.      In school we study sentence grammar (nouns and verbs) and essay construction (topic sentences and such), but we don't really cover what I imagine the subject \\"rhetoric\\" contains: the structure of arguments and reasoning.  This book picks up there, teaching a \\"grammar\\" of effective ways to communicate ideas.  Once you read about these approaches, it's easy to start noticing them in messages and consulting them as a checklist.    For instance, let's examine their own book now: with the same material, they could have titled it \\"Proven Communication Methods\\" (boring).  But they create a mystery, make us aware of a gap in our knowledge: why *do* some ideas stay with us longer than others?  Now it's a provocative question, a much better framing for the content.  (Lesson right out of Chapter 2.)    For instance: the book got me thinking about new ways to present about my own work.  In Chapter 6, we learn that the desire to \\"experiment with new approaches\\" can be triggered by \\"Creativity plots\\"--anecdotes about people \\"tackling problems in innovative ways.\\"  Well, come to think of it: this very book is full of stories about people brilliantly shaping their messages.  No wonder I felt creative.    In sum: helps you dissect and construct messages. For me, this one's a keeper.
B000M39SYE|5.0|This movie is fairly dated.  Most of the claims Moore makes are now commonly accepted especially the primary one, that we were misled into a war in Iraq and that the Bush regime is a crony of liars and scoundrels.  It's important to consider this film in its political and historical context though.  This came out shortly before the 2004 election and Moore was crucified by right wing media pundits for it (although he was widely cheered by others).  The only real exception to Moore being correct is an aside that has not been validated or revisited; his mentioning some oil pipeline across Afghanistan which hasn't been talked about in a long time, probably for a good reason.
B00005JPTI|4.0|Though it stoops for unearned sentimentality at the end, \\"I Am Legend,\\" until then, is a spine-tingling vision of a future devoid of humanity.  And hope.  Will Smith turns in a landmark performance as Dr. Robert Neville, the sole survivor in a New York City decimated by a man-made plague.  During the day, Neville and his faithful dog travel the city for sustenance and spiritual survival.  The images of a downtown Manhattan crumbling and decaying are downright chilling.  But in the dark corners await bloodthirsty monsters that were transformed by the plague from ordinary humans to something more primitive, feral and terrifying.  Director Francis Lawrence (Constantine) and gifted cinematographer Andrew Lesnie (The Lord of the Rings) construct nerve-frying, blood-freezing sequences in an abandoned building and a New York seaport at night when Neville finds himself face to face with the cannibalistic creatures.  But Neville's true fight is not with them or with the disease he so fervently tries to cure; it's with his own dissipating sanity.  Where the film works best is when it let's Smith work his Hanksian magic, chronicling Neville's daily routine (talking to Manicheans as if they were real, waiting in seeming vain at the aforementioned seaport for any sign of life) to fight off absolute desolation.  Smith finds the ravaged, fragile soul of a man fighting for one more day, one more fleeting chance that hope will reveal itself.  When Lawrence and his screenwriters stick with this bleak, desperate story for survival, \\"I Am Legend\\" connects with unexpected emotional body blows.  The predictable deus ex machina ending blunts the emotional impact shows, but until then, \\"I Am Legend\\" is a harrowing vision of a future where hope hangs by a vulnerable thread.
0740748475|5.0|Got this for Christmas today.  I was an avid follower of the strip (still have a couple of favorite clipped strips, including the last one, tucked away into a book somewhere).  I've owned just about all of the softbacks at one point or another.  Honestly, I don't care about the wherefore's or why-come's of vaguely-notioned author edits or sticky bindings.  Because this is IT - the ultimate Calvin and Hobbes.  My daughter-in-law has already threatened to steal it (as a stopgap, I've given her supervised access to the reference library, so she'll be able to peruse it under controlled conditions).  Thank you, Bill.  And THANK YOU, SANTA.
1400049628|5.0|I'm not sure if this is all real but I'm going to say so,  this is a great read if you watch movies like Shaun Of The Dead, and great for some scarey campfire/sleepover style nights
1400062756|3.0|I agree with C. Daly's review: This book could have been a small pamphlet. You can get the essence of it just by reading the last chapter, chapter 8. I think many reviewers mix up the idea with the book: The finding and description of mindsets - fixed and growth - is very valuable. As Dr. Dweck shows over and over and over in her book, using the mindset framework deepens our understanding of a lot of behavior, our own and that of other people. The book, however, falls short in fostering the growth mindset, the mindset it so positively describes. After finishing the book, I was left standing outside the candy store: I wanted to learn the growth mindset but I didn't get the tools. Yes, there were some suggestions in the book but most of it felt very superficial and not concrete enough to really use. For example, Dweck writes \\"enter the growth mindset and listen harder\\" (p. 232). Okay, I get that. But how do I do that? It almost feels like the book was written from a fixed mindset perspective: Dr. Dweck is such a great scientist and she did some wonderful remarkable work and we all should be in awe. That is the judge-and-be-judged framework, not the learn-and-help-learn framework (p. 238).     Most of the book is full of anecdotes showing the mindsets in action. They are fun to read since the retelling of the stories is well written. Some of them are inspiring. But, again, the book did not help me learn. It gave me a good taste of a more supportive frame of mind but it did not give me the tools to change my mind. That is especially disappointing since this is so contrary to the growth mindset...
B000QXDED6|5.0|I finally got around to seeing 300 after hearing about the film earlier in the year. I've always been inspired by the Battle of Thermopylae which was a major reason why I wanted to see it. I wasn't sure what to expect though. The way 300 was described by reviewers made it sound like a cross between a historical adaptation and a video game. The first thing I noticed, as did so many others, is that these frames are a visual feast. The battle scenes were absolutely outstanding. Gerard Butler makes for an excellent King Leonidas and David Wenham cast as Dilios was another magnificent decision and one which will hearten fans of The Lord of the Rings because his work as Faromir was near-perfect. His role here becomes larger and more brilliant as this film rolls forth. The most poignant message that this love note to antiquity delivers is that, contrary to what many a spoiled and plush westerner may otherwise believe, some things in life really are worth dying for. All of us will soon be dust but to retain our honor, virtue, and liberty in the process...well, those are the acts of an immortal. My contemporaries will do well to remember Leonidas and hope that one day someone may say of them that it was \\"an honor to have lived at your side.\\"
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Stardust is a wonderful Movie. It's definitely not a movie for young children. It is full of frightening scenes and lets not talk about the romance. So rent the kiddies a nice \\"G\\" rated animation. The movie itself was spectacular. The special affects were marvelous and acting superb with just the right touch of humor. I was disappointed that it didn't rake in the bucks that the latest Harry Potter Film did. This film was everything that the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix should have been. Enjoy.

B0002CYPVQ|1.0|I purchased this for my son for Christmas.  Once it came out of the box we were completely dissappointed.  The child loves it but I give it a few days until it is a heap of plastic uselessness.  It is made of the cheapest plastic imaginable.  I cannot believe how expensive this is we paid $51.99 through amazon last month.  It is shocking how cheaply it is made and being what we thought was a great named manufacturer (Bruder) we definitely expected better quality.  Hopefully we can find another better made excavator.  if you are considering this please keep looking. It is a waste of money.
6300208591|5.0|I remember seeing this movie when it first came out, in fact it was the first movie I went to see more than once. For some reason it resonated with me then as much as now. I recently watched it again, and found the scene at Steiner's apartment to be quite fascinating.  Here we have a man who is hemmed in by the walls of society, and the way for him to experience nature is by making audo tapes of the sounds of rain, storms,and other facets of creation. Then he can play them back in the safety of his apartment, apparently unable to just enjoy the outdoors in all its beauty. He is afraid of the future, and can't break away from society and its walls.  Perhaps that is why he is attracted to Marcello's character, who just floats freely about, apparently without a worry.

006088732X|4.0|Once upon a time, there were five little girls. These little girls were very different, but they still became friends. Best friends forever . . . or so they thought. One night in middle school, after a slumber party, one little girl - Alison, the most manipulative and controlling of the group - disappeared, and the four girls who were left behind - Aria, Emily, Hanna, and Spencer - became Pretty Little Liars.<br /><br />Three years later, the girls are no longer close. Everyone still knows everyone else's business, of course, that's how their suburb operates, but they don't socialize. Each girl excels at something, be it art, athletics, or fashion. Each girl looks to be leading a happy, healthy life, but she is hiding something from her family - something she thinks no one else knows.<br /><br />Then messages start appearing on cell phones or computer screens, short notes threatening to spill their precious little secrets. All of the messages are signed by \\"A.\\" But who is it? Is it one of them, or is Alison back? How does whoever it is know all that's going on behind closed doors?<br /><br />These books are addictive. Really addictive. After the original book, every following book in the line has had a one-word title, but they could also be titled I Know What You Did Last Summer, Gossip Girl. Seriously. Lying, cheating, murder, shoplifting, eating disorders - these books have it all. Each of the girls has a distinct look and personality (and it should be noted the books' covers fit them perfectly) but they are not cookie-cutter rich girls. Author Sara Shepard has taken what could be yet another story about superficial girls and twisted it, making it into a darker story, a mystery saturated with guilty pleasures that will intrigue older teens and adult readers.
B000Y44LBG|3.0|A decent crime movie with quite an impressive performance by Denzel Washington. At over two and a half hours, the movie drags on and stretches a simple story into something it's not. What a shame that this movie chose to focus more on being didactic, rather than entertaining. There's very few things to explore here, and personally, I enjoyed a movie like Blow a lot more.

B000UBMZ4S|5.0|Just received this 5-disc HD on Xmas Eve, and it's a blast!!  The HD is comparable to what I've seen in the digital projection of \\"Blade Runner\\"-the final cut in West Los Angeles (it played due to popular demand for over a month!!)--a vision to behold.  Enough raves have been said about this classic so if you're a true fan of this noir/sci-fi and you have either a HD or Blu-ray player with a 1080p HDTV--you'll really relish in the details. As for myself, I have the Toshiba A-2 Hd with a JVC 46\\" LCD and this special edition brings out the best in both!!  Since the time I've updated my equipment to a Panasonic VT50 series plasma--and what a difference in black levels, particularly this type of film!!  If you are lucky to still own an HD DVD player, I'd recommend getting it in this format over the Blu-ray which is $72 compared to $25 in HD DVD!!  Definitely a classic worth owning.

0451197879|5.0|Story:  Barton Dawes was a normal man working in his laundry mat. He had a loving wife and a life he was happy with. Until the day came that he found that his house and his business was going to be demolished in the name of progress. His home was to become the site of a new interstate. On that day Bart snapped. This is the story of how Bart falls and what he finds out about himself, his life, and his world on the way down...  -------  To start off this book is *dark* it almost reminded me of another book called \\"The edge of human\\" by K.W.Jeeter. When you glance up from reading the sun doesn't seem quite as bright as it was before you started. This does as some of the other reviews on this page seem to be more of a main stream book than other King books,no supernatural forces or evil beings just one man self destructing. In between bouts of multiple personality arguements, dark depression and drug/alchol binges dawes finds his self looking at his life clearly for the first time. Most of the book deals with his discovery that he never dealt with the death of his son, he just went on auto-piolt for x amount of years and its not really the road work that set him on his path its that he was desperatly/painfully angry that his son was taken away from him and with the coming of the road he could no longer coast along in his own little world.  Even as Dawes takes the final steps the man that he was still emerges here and there as with Olivia and the Arms dealer, a little light in the overwhelming darkness. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes thier horror set in the real world, with nary a boogeyman insight and also of course anyone who likes Steven King no matter what name he is writing under. m.a.c
B00004SZWD|5.0|This album is truly mind blowing, no other way to describe it.  A fusion of such a variety of sounds... done so well, this is a great example of why Stevie is regarded as a legend in the music industry.  I would def. recommend this to younger people, because EVERYTHING on the radio these days is complete garbage.  This is REAL music.
B000002BSG|4.0|I really dig this music, maybe it reminds me of the 80's, or TV in my youth, but I don't find it easy to pigeon-hole this kind of funky, jazzy, poppy, dance music. Sure, it has a retro-feel, but Jamiroquai has a lot of danceable energy that's fun to listen to. It's not sugar-coated yet appeals to my 3 & 6 yr. old as well. Some of the tunes on this album aren't as catchy as others, but overall, Travelling Without Moving works very well. I also like Canned Heat, a song they did for the movie Center Stage, not surprisingly a dance movie.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Macy's Department Store hires a Santa Claus (Edmund Gwenn) for the toy department and he becomes quite a sensation with customers.  Unfortunately, they soon learn that the man, who goes by the name Kris Kringle, believes he is the actual Santa Claus.  This ends up leading to a commitment hearing where his lawyer, Fred Gailey (John Payne) must prove that Kris is exactly what he claims to be.<br /><br />Miracle on 34th Street is a lighthearted Christmas classic with a message that never goes out of style.  The movie is meant to remind all of us that Christmas is a time of giving and that the real meaning is too easily swamped by commercialism.  Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) and her daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) provide another aspect in that they are hardheaded pragmatists who don't believe in anything tangible.  Kris takes it as a personal challenge to bring a little magic and imagination into their lives.<br /><br />This is an interesting and entertaining movie for many reasons.  First, Santa Claus is often cited as an example of the commercialization of Christmas, but here he acts as its conscience.  Kris represents the best of humanity with his generosity, warmth, and kindness.  The movie may have gone a bit far in demonizing common sense but its heart is in the right place.  The performances are uniformly excellent and in a small role William Frawley (better known as Fred Mertz to Lucy fans) steals the show in all of his scenes.<br /><br />Miracle on 34th Street offers a bit of everything.  It's a comedy that's laugh out loud funny when it tries to be.  It's part schmaltzy Christmas movie and revels in that role, but just manages to avoid drowning in sappiness.  And it remains a very relevant fable about the excesses of modern society including being overly obsessed with materialism at the expense of intangibles that make live really worth living.  If you've never seen it, then give it a try and you just might find your new favorite holiday movie.

0618680004|5.0|All of you who believe in supernatural gods, like Thor, Athena, Mercury, Zeus, and yes, even Allah and God, please read no further lest you encounter what your beliefs call blasphemy.  The rest of us call it truth.  The truth is that there are no gods.  There never have been.  There are only humans that have an emotional need to invent gods to explain the mysteries that humans cannot easily fathom or accept.  It has been this way for all the religions and gods that have already come and gone, and it is still this way with the religions we have today.  Occasionally, a few humans see the delusion for what it really is, and once in a blue moon, one of them will stand up and announce the obvious that everyone else has refused to see, just like the little boy in The Emperor's New Clothes who dares to exclaim, \\"But, the Emperor has no clothes!\\"  Richard Dawkins does exactly this in his book The God Delusion.  Dawkins is no stranger to clear thinking, eloquent writing, and keen observation of human behavior, as he has amply demonstrated in his many prior books.  In The God Delusion, Dawkins reviews the problems of all the typical arguments for the existence of God, from the classic arguments of Saint Thomas Aquinas to those of modern religious scientists.  Dawkins then moves on to show why there almost certainly is no God, the \\"almost\\" a necessary qualifier required by the impossibility of disproving a fantasy that is beyond the reach of any test.  By the middle of the book, Dawkins summarizes his arguments against God with the clarity of a child who asks, \\"If God created everything, then who created God?\\"  If that's not immediately clear to you, it will be if you read this book.  The second half of the book delves into where the human need for religion comes from, why morality is not derived from religious beliefs, and why religion is so dangerous to us all (as if Iraq hasn't already demonstrated this).  This is exactly what should be required reading for every human being before any label of being educated is conferred upon him.    Personally, I have long felt that human civilization will never reach maturity until it throws off the chains and blinders of religion and superstition.  Only then will humanity leave behind its childish ways and seriously begin the journey towards its full potential.  This book could very well be the first prominent paving stone of the road that will take us to that maturity.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|We bought the video when it first came out for our little kids and we all loved it and have worn it out.  Now my kids are 20 years old and I decided to replace the video with a DVD.  The quality of this DVD was disappointing as it seems it is a copy made from a not-perfect video. In other words, not re-mastered.  Black flecks are sporadically visible.  But it is a lovely film and a family ritual to watch at the first snow of the season.
B000A176VU|5.0|I am a huge fan of Ken Follett and this is the book that started it all for me.  Any fan of World War II fiction would be hard pressed not to find something to like about this fast-paced, utterly realistic thriller that features a wonderful female protagonist and ruthless yet somehow admirable villain.  Although I would have liked the character of Percy Godliman more fully developed, this book rises above the typical thriller in that the characters are so fully and memorably drawn.  Meticulously researched and evoking realistic settings, this book is not only written in a suspenseful manner, it's extremely well-written technically.  This book led me to \\"The Man from St. Petersburg,\\" \\"The Key to Rebecca,\\" and \\"Lie Down with Lions,\\" as well as the Follett masterpiece \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\"  I must admit that his other books, in my opinion, do not measure up to these five.

B000K15VSA|5.0|A few years ago, George Lucas appealed to fans by reluctantly releasing the original theatrical versions of his Star Wars films.  Needless to say, they were released as bonus features to the special editions without upgraded audio and a non anamorphic transfer.  This wasn't really a set for the fans; rather, it was a cash in.      So it was a pleasant surprise to see Ridley Scott introduce the old theatrical version of Blade Runner stating that it was cleaned up and remastered so the viewer could watch Blade Runner whichever way he or she preferred.  It's a pit of the fan touch that makes this collection so wonderful.    There are a load of special features in this collection that make it worthwhile.  Most notably is the direct involvement of those originally behind the film - especially Ridley Scott who provides commentary on the final cut and is present throughout the Dangerous Days documentary.    The Dangerous Days documentary has to be one of the most thorough accounts of any one film, tracking the film's origins through its present cult status.  There is one feature that highlights one of the film's age old questions: is Deckard a replicant.  Amusingly, Frank Darabont, director of Shawshank Redemption, is interviewed, making a case against him being a replicant.    Then there are a slew of deleted scenes and promotional materials.  There's even a featurette about the posters.  How detailed can you get?  Probably the jewel in this set for fans is the work print version.  It's a curiosity piece, and while its inclusion is mandatory, it'll probably only get a couple spins on my dvd player.  The final cut is so beautiful, you really don't need any other version except maybe for nostalgia.    The final extra is the package itself, a plastic briefcase, featuring a plastic shiny origami unicorn (great at parties for making your friends think THEY'RE replicants) and a replica of the car driven in the film.  There are also a nifty lenticular picture encased in glass featuring Harrison Ford and some cards detailing some of the production art.    As for the film itself, after 25 years, Blade Runner doesn't show its age, celebrating a time when special effects were a true art form.  There is no CGI here.  Instead  Ridley Scott provides a visually arresting film depicting a dark, souless future.  You can spend hours detailing the metaphors found in the film as Deckard searches for replicants in a very dehumanized world, ultimately questioning his own humanity.  There are characters who have such depth that they are some of the most memorable scifi characters ever.  The somewhat manic Roy Batty, violent, poetic, and tragic, is still amazing to watch and listen to as he is so beautifully portrayed by Rutger Hauer.  The quest for humanity by all the characters is a universal theme that has inspired films both in and out of the realm of science fiction films for years and has made this film a classic.  If you are a real fan - you need to pick up this package - it's indespensible.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|Well, I expected more of this. Sort of. Or maybe the problem is, I didn't exactly know what to expect.<br /><br />Three quarters of the movie you can listen to something else, just not my type of thing. Maybe because I have my personal Babel since 4 years.<br />The parts were very well played though. Not like a not very convincing Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Their story and acting was at parts very unrealistic and I just didn't buy their play.<br />I hope, the other actors did get as much money for the movie as these two did, for they for sure deserved it more.<br />You can follow the story well, that's one good thing, I guess and I love the part that plays in Marocco.

The video and sound quality are both great, and as far as I know this set includes every episode of the show (including the pilot).  The postcards were a nice added bonus (it seems they include random postcards because I have some doubles).  I haven't watched all of the extras but the SNL and cast reunion features were very entertaining.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00009MGGI|5.0|Everything about The House of Cards is amazing. Ian Richardson's acting is one of the best things I have ever seen. Some of the appeal of this series lies in its playful narrative: the main character Francis Urquhart (F.U.) sometimes also assumes the role of the narrator and breaks the fourth wall. If you are interested in British politics and the Thatcher era or want to imagine what Stewie Griffin would look like as a serious adult politician, check it out. It is hands down the best political thriller there is.

Marcus never intended for his journals (which is what the Meditations are) to be published and was writing to himself. Why would someone writing to themselves write in a technical manner reminiscent of a modern philosophical treatise? Why? Because that was the style in which ancient philosophy was translated in the early 20th century.<br /><br />Marcus scolds those who obsess over rhetoric, grammar, syllogisms and logic crunching within the Meditations and for a very clear reason: he is concerned with a human message, primarily centered around ethics and pursuit of virtue, not any abstract theorizing common to the pretensions of imitation philosophy. It is absurd to assume Marcus would have wrote to himself in such a lofty, holier-than-thou, technical and abstract fashion (see: the \\"standard\\" George Long translation). It is more likely that Marcus would have been influenced by the language of Epictetus, and if the Discourses and Enchiridion as relayed by Arrian are any clue, the language of Stoicism at this time was quite accessible to the common reason.<br /><br />Hays offers a natural translation of the Meditations with immediacy, warmness, humanity and stunning beauty, truly bringing to life the eternal wisdom of the philosopher king. Marcus' words are presented in an almost poetic fashion which inspires the reader to greatness and contemplation in pondering the core themes of transience, goodness and service.<br /><br />The type of man Marcus was, and the type of virtue he advocated, is sorely missing in today's society. Prudence, temperance, fortitude and justice as character traits seem to be gone from the world and only found in the writings of dead Greeks and Romans. But in reading these texts the virtues are reborn, as is the \\"Greek lifestyle\\" of austerity, civic duty and integrity, at least in the mind and heart of the reader.<br /><br />The Meditations is all about how to endure the stresses of the world while coming out on top of them even stronger than before, and even more excellent. I found Marcus' words to be a godsend in times of hopelessness  and longing as I discovered that the things which caused me grief were only temporary in nature, were outside of my control, or were irrelevant considering the immense scope of the cosmos (time) and our minute proportion of it.in the writings of dead Greeks and Romans.

B000YENUI6|4.0|I'm actually shocked.  I kind of imagined that I would enjoy this film, at least a little, but it turned out to be, easily, one of the top five movies of the year.    An excellent crime film that could easily become \\"The Godfather\\" of Russian mob movies.  A superb cast, brilliant script, and a director who seems to be getting better with age.  These are truly memorable characters.     Who thought he could only go up after \\"The Fly\\"?.......    Definately worth a rental, but not for the weak at heart.
0226039331|5.0|I purchased the second edition of this volume when I was studying Greek at Denver Seminary, back in 1989 as it was highly recommend by my Greek professor. And I used it quite a bit during seminary and even after that in my personal Bible studies.<br /><br />When I began work on my [[ASIN:0615167519 Analytical-Literal Translation of the New Testament: Third Edition]] (ALT), I got the [[ASIN:B000EGHMKG BibleWorks 7]] software program. That program has several lexicons that come standard with it, and it is a lot easier to use those lexicons than to look up words in this volume. But even with that program, with wanting to be exact as possible in my translations, I would still check Baur on occasion as it contains information that is not found in BibleWorks. Most especially, this volume indicates how words were used in extra-biblical literature. And this info can be a great help in getting an idea of how a particular word was used at the time the NT was written.<br /><br />For instance, I depended on information in Baur to decide how to translate the plural of \\"adelphos.\\" Most lexicons give definitions like \\"brother, fellow Christian, fellow believer\\" (Friberg on BibleWorks). But Baur's lexicon indicates \\"The plural can also mean brothers and sisters\\" (p.16). It then gives specific examples of this usage in extra-biblical literature.<br /><br />This concurs with what I was taught at seminary that \\"adelphoi\\" was used to refer to a group of only men and to a group of both men and women. So I decided that the best way to render this word was to use \\"brothers [and sisters].\\" This rendering indicates the term definitely includes men but might also include women (e.g., Rom 1:13).<br /><br />So this lexicon can be very helpful in pinning down the exact usage of words. But it is very expensive, and I see it is now available as an add-on for BibleWorks. Given the expense of the new third edition and of the BibleWorks add-on, since I already own the second edition, I won't be getting either of these. But if you don't own a previous version and intend to do in-depth Greek word studies, then either this hardcopy version or the BibleWorks add-on would be worthwhile.don't own a previous version and intend to do in-depth Greek word studies, then either this hardcopy version or the BibleWorks add-on would be worthwhile.
B000W1V5VU|4.0|Ocean's Thirteen takes place after Ocean's Twelve returned from their European heist.   This time the target is Las Vegas' finest: Willy Bank.  Up against such overwhelming odds Ocean has to ally with someone he never thought possible...   George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Al Pacino, Elliott Gould, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few laughs.    The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!  In short, Ocean's Thirteen is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection along with the other two in the trilogy!

B000F5GNX8|5.0|A really offbeat murder mystery capitalizing on the humorous interactions between Downey and Kilmer's characters. The plot has many twists and turns and numerous incidents of a humorous nature. The only down side is the constant use of gratuitous vulgar language through out the entire flick. It detracts from a truly unique visual experience.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|This message is intended for the Bladerunner fans who gave the album  a thumbs down.      These die hard Bladerunner fans need to cool it down.     What did they expect?????     Of course Vangelis was not going to release a complete Bladerunner score.  It didn't surprise me at all. I mean....look at Vangelis's other stuff...     He has done soundtracks to other movies...and the complete score is never released.  Vangelis will never release a complete score to any movie. That's the way Vangelis is.  I can live with that. Can you?? I have the bootlegs and i'm happy with those.  .  The chances of releasing THE COMPLETE Bladerunner is slim to none.  Maybe when Vangelis leaves this world, that's when the complete score may be released.     But I understand how the Bladerunner fans feel.  EVERYBODY wants to hear the complete score.     But Fans don't understand what kind of person they are dealing with.  Vangelis is a recluse just like the great Stanley Kubrick and Howard Hughes.   They can be difficult to deal with and they will not always listen to the fans wishes or requests.   These artists will only appease themselves.     What I'm trying to say is that.....the Bladerunner fans have to respect him for who he is.  Vangelis may be a great composer but he can be difficult. People have to accept that as well.  I do.     People have to understand that there are some things in life (and that goes with people too)  that can't change. If Vangelis doesn't want to release the complete score to Bladerunner, then so be it.   That's life. Life goes on. Its not the end of the world.     Vangelis is one of my all time favorites. I love his music.  But I also disagree with how he handles his material.  Some of it should be released....but Vangelis has other ideas...and i learned to respect that.  I can't argue with him....I just have to learn to accept his ideas.     The true die hard fans will learn to drop the criticism and learn to accept the Trilogy as it is.  I heard some of the stuff already from the internet, and I was very pleased with what i heard.  I'm greatful to have had the opportunity to listen to more good Bladerunner stuff.  Sure, it would be great to have more good Bladerunner new stuff added to the trilogy,   but maybe Vangelis is saving that for later...he continues to tease.   The Bladerunner mystique lives on...thanks to Vangelis.     The die hard fans should also listen to Vangelis's other works.  Some people will say Vangelis's Bladerunner is the best album he has ever done.  AND I SAY THEY ARE WRONG.     Vangelis has done so many great scores like Cosmos, Antartica, El Greco, Alexander, The City,   Direct, Oceanic, the Olympics, and other stuff that he has done in the 70's, 80's, and 90's...  all of them are equally impressive. Each album takes you to another time, dimension or atmosphere.   Its staggering and mind blowing.     I'm just greatful that i had the opportunity to listen to the bootleg stuff from everything that I downloaded.....  i'm just at awe with the great master Vangelis. :)      Those Bladerunner fans just need to find another hobby instead of trashing the trilogy.  Put away Bladerunner for awhile and do something else...maybe they should trash Star Trek..hahaaahha     I look forward to listening to the new soundtrack to El Greco when it comes out.  Whether or not El Greco will be a bootleg or not...thats fine with me....its just going to be another   great listening experience. :)    As for the trilogy, i just recently received it...and  i'm just totally amazed at disk 2 and 3.  Its an incredible experience and i just want to lay down and dream about the Bladerunner  soundtrack.    I don't have time to give my impressions on the album. hahahha    Just go buy it

I wish they would cut the B.S. and put out a decent live DVD already.  My wife bought this for me for Christmas, and all I could think about is that she put down $9 for a music video?  Granted, they do package their CD/DVD's well and give the customers some value with respect to the visuals.  Hey guys, stop being so recluse and show us some concert footage.    The masses are waiting.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Planet Earth is easily the single greatest documentary I've ever seen! My wife, my parents and my in-laws have all become hooked on this series and they are not exactly HD enthusiasts or nature lovers. I first saw PE on TV in HD but it does not compare.  David is a much better narrator and these episodes are much longer and more detailed and they're in 1080p. It's quite possibly the single greatest thing I've ever seen on TV or Video. It's hard to tell someone not to buy this but if you're not getting it in HD, you're missing out big time!    For those who enjoy documentaries, I urge you to watch \\"The War\\" by Ken Burns. You will not be disappointed!

0765357151|4.0|Just to clarify, only half of the book is I Am Legend while the rest consists of some of Matheson's short stories which aren't really any good.<br /><br />It's still worth the purchase though. Plot is very different from the movie with Will Smith and the title actually makes sense in the book. Not very scary but poses some intriguing questions to think about.

B000TLTUL0|5.0|Johnny Depp once again proves that he can do anything, and that the Academy has overlooked him for too long.  His performance in Sweeney Todd is simply amazing.  A dark, hateful, vicious character that no one in their right mind would find themselves rooting for, but I did.      There are many long reviews about this film already posted, so I'll leave them to dissect the entire plot, the music, and the other characters.  I will just tell you that if you go in looking for your standard horror show, you will be dissappointed.  If you are looking for a beautifully cast, filmed, acted, and directed picture, this is the one for you.

B000UBMSB8|4.0|\\"Blade Runner\\" looks terrific and it's great to finally have all four versions of the film in one place. My only complaint is that it would have been better to include the work print version (the fifth and rarest version of the film) instead of the Director's Cut (which had its own release a couple of months back). Since the \\"Director's Cut\\" is on a seamlessly branching disc, it's not all that big a deal but WHY should you have to get it again? It would have made better sense to include the \\"Work Print\\" version for fans. It's a minor quibble but I've dinged the set a star for not being complete (The movie certainly deserves 5 stars and the set is really good--just not perfect which is what that 5 star rating is all about folks).<br /><br /> If you can live without the \\"Work Print\\" version of the film, however, this may be the set for you since it is 1) less expensive than the deluxe \\"Ultimate Edition\\" with the briefcase and toys and 2)includes both the documentary AND all three previous versions of the movie on one disc.<br /><br />Regardless, this is a very good set for the money and clearly the \\"Work Print\\" wasn't included to get folks to buy the \\"Ultimate Edition\\".<br /><br />This edition includes:<br /><br />1)The newly edited \\"Final Cut\\" which eliminates the narration, makes some minor trims to the film, puts Joanna Cassidy in the sequence where Zora is shot and killed (the stunt woman didn't look anything like her and wore a bad wig), fixes some continuity errors that happened when the sequence where Deckard fights Leon was pushed AFTER Zora was killed, erase the cables holding the Spinners, eliminate various crew members that accidently appeared on shots and finally adding in the original unicorn sequence shot for the film.<br /><br />2)\\"Dangerous Days\\" a three hour documentary on the trials and tribulations of making the film from conception to completion and the enduring popularity of the film.<br /><br />3)All three previous versions on a seamless branched DVD.

B000W07EKW|1.0|Seriously, don't be fooled.  You get this \\"Super Cool\\" silver box and when you open it...all it is, is the 3 movies as if you bought them off the used rack shelf for $5 each.  Seriously, it's a waste of time.  Just buy them separately.  This is so much to the point that each individually wrapped movie has tape on them where the security tag would usually go.      The movies are THE BEST...but don't be fooled by this packaging.  And the bonus material is a COMPLETE let down.  There is so much they could have done...instead we get a documentary of the writer.  It's interesting but still, I would have loved to see more on the stunts, Damon's acting, etc.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|Wow. You could call this overkill or OCD in action but Warner has assembled the ultimate edition of \\"Blade Runner\\" for its anniversary. Many others have noted what's included here so I'll comment on them briefly and then address image quality, etc.<br /><br />Here's the run down:<br /><br />1)\\"The Final Cut\\" is on disc one of the set. This edition which has many tweaks including the cleaning up of continuity errors that Scott would have fixed if he had the time back in the 90's and 80's  (and the money to do so). This includes digitally removed the cable that hoists the Spinners, removing a bruise from Harrison Ford's face when the fight with Leon was placed AFTER Zora's killing (dramatically it made sense to put it after but it was originally before Zora's killing), replacing the stunt woman's face with Joanna Cassidy's so it looks good (Cassidy would have done the stunt if she had been asked but this is the next best thing since, again, if fixes a major glaring error), the ORIGINAL Unicorn scene shot for the movie but left out of the final version restored to the film and various other minor tweaks, a brief clip of the infamous scene of the dancing girls wearing the hockey masks.<br />2))\\"Dangerous Days\\" (the title of the original screenplay)a full length 3 hour documentary on the trials and tribulations that Scott, Harrison Ford and the rest of the cast and crew went through to make \\"Blade Runner\\". This documentary is very fair balanced and covers the very conception of the film when Hampton Fancher optioned Dick's novel, interested producer Michael Deeley to Scott's involvement. It does skirt over the involvement and interest of other directors (and there were a few). Scott initially passed on the project and was set to direct Dino DeLaurentiis production of \\"Dune\\" until his older brother died. After that, he decided he didn't want to spent all the pre-production time on \\"Dune\\" and re-evaluated his priorities jumping on the project but also demanding rewrites from Fancher and eventually bringing in writer David Peoples (\\"Unforgiven\\", \\"Soldier\\"--which interestingly enough is what Peoples calls \\"an indirect\\" sequel to \\"Blade Runner\\" set in the same universe). Writer Paul Sammon (who provides a commentary track for \\"Blade Runner\\")wrote an excellent book that covers much of the same ground and appears discussing various aspects of production--this is essentially that book in documentary form.<br /><br />3)The original theatrical release from 1982 unaltered. The \\"International Release\\" again unaltered. The \\"Director's Cut\\" released in the 90's and the only version available on DVD until now in the United States.<br />All three of these are on a single seamlessly branching disc where you select which version you want to watch. That's good news for those who love the original theatrical release with the narration, those that grew used to watching the international version which is exactly the same except for two minutes of extended violence. It was this version that showed up on home video. The \\"Director's Cut\\" shares more in common than differences between the other two with the narration missing and the happy ending as well as some minor trims here and there.<br /><br />4)Disc four has the \\"Enhancement Archives\\" which includes documentaries on writer Philip K. Dick, his legacy and a comparison between the novel and film highlighting how Scott and his collaborators created a work that compliments the film finding film equivelents to Dick's vision.<br /><br />5)The famous \\"Workprint\\" version that differs signficantly in some areas including a different opening title sequence and other minor differences. Although this isn't the \\"Director's Cut\\" version, its showing at a film festival is what prompted Scott and Warner to go back and create the \\"Director's Cut\\". This edition looks the worst of the five versions of the film presented here simply because the source material always looked much grainier and never looked as pristine as the final cut. The opening titles on this edition are completely different and there are other differences as well that fans will pick up.<br /><br />Various toys including a Spinner and a Unicorn along with other cool collectable are in a nice little box that resembles the brief case that Deckard carries around the Voight-Kaumpf machine in. Fans of the film will probably want this edition but those who just want the movies may want to pick up the Blu-ray, HD-DVD five disc editions or, if you're willing to NOT have the workprint version, the four disc edition on DVD.<br /><br />Image quality is stellar. The film has never looked this good in any of its incarnations. Personally, I would go for the high definition Blu-ray but the HD-DVD edition looks equally good. I've never seen \\"Blade Runner\\" looking this crisp.<br /><br />This is the ultimate set for fans but be aware you can purchase the five disc edition without purchasing the \\"Ultimate\\" edition.s edition are completely different and there are other differences as well that fans will pick up.

B000005RPX|4.0|The one thing that detracts from this CD set is the poor mix - unlike on the Made In Japan release where everything is perfectly balanced, Blackmore's guitar is, at times, nowhere to be heard in the mix, with the keyboards being louder at times than they need to be. It's unfortunate that the same care that was given to the original release was not to be found here. On the flip side, do we really need to hear Blackmore tuning his guitar at the beginnings of some songs? That's where he should have been mixed out.    In any case, an outstanding collection worthy many listens, even though the mix is uneven throughout.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|One of the most inspirational movies ever made and extraordinary acting by all. Highly recommended for everyone from teens to elders. I bought one for each of my adult children at Christmas.
080701429X|5.0|So many times we only learn from theory but Frankl learns about life from his experience as a prisoner.  He finds how to find purpose in the middle of his suffering.  He finds beauty similar to Dostoevsky, which makes him stay alive.
B00026YO36|5.0|My first exposure to Mark Lanegan was hearing \\"I Nearly Lost You\\" in the background of the embarassing 90s movie \\"singles\\" when I was say 12. I ignored the Screaming Trees as this was one of maybe 2 or 3 songs (out of hundreds) of his I don't enjoy. It took another decade to hear this and subsequently buy everything in his catalogue. If you're frequently broke as I am, go straightedge for a few days until you save $100 or so and buy everything of his. It's all gold. At least buy this, field songs and whiskey for the holy ghost. So worth it.
B000UZ4G8M|5.0|The DVD box set came exactly as promised--in brand new condition. Would recommend buying from this seller and would do so again personally.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|Im a ZEP FREAK also and I say buy it not just for the nicely re-done sound and video but for all the extra`s themselves.  Unlike the other reviewer before me I think its well worth the extra $.  No the shirt isnt the best made shirt in the world but its still nice and all the extras are very nice treats,from the press photo`s all the way to the ticket replicas its all a must have if you LOVE and adore ZEPPELIN & collect their stuff besides just the music..I have everything Zeppelin ever did including almost all the singles including their solo years singles and full versions and promos from all three remaining members..I liked this set very much including all the extra collectables that definately added to an allready massive collection I allready have of tickets,press kits,etc from them but loved each and every piece that this collectors set had to add to my collection..Dont forget the free POSTER deal by mail to top things off..  A blank DVD case will fill the gap from the shirt being removed to keep your outside box in nice condition and fill the empty space..    My suggestion:By this set before its in the $200 range...
B0011MZOEI|5.0|Some serious action combined with clever dialogue that puts this Die Hard fan in a happy place.
B000VPUIA6|1.0|I was so thrilled to buy this for my daughter who is the biggest Beatle fan. Everything seemed great until we went to watch disc 2 and it the same as 1 but labeled 2. Hence no special features.  I'm sure this can't be the only one like this. I'm in the middle of an exchange with Amazon. I hope it's cleared up soon. I guess it would have been better to buy in person so the exchange could be done that way too. So much for saving money. D. K.
B00116FT6M|5.0|A very successful remake that's still as retro-modern as the original. Better than Broadway! I'm sure John Waters is proud of this production.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The time and money spent to watch this DVD series was well worth it.  Absolutely incredible photography of places, vegetation and animals in this vast world that we wouldn't have had the opportunity to see otherwise.
1883217040|3.0|I bought this book thinking that it would help me understand jazz theory. It only got me confused and frustrated.     1.There's lots of blah-blah & unnecessary name-dropping. An instructional book should be concise and to-the-point.   2.About a quarter of this book was wasted with a list of artists & tunes. (Publisher's way of bulking up the book)  3.There are too many short pieces of examples with no context. And when are they going to learn that a CD is worth a thousand pages of blah-blah?    Soon after, I found a number of learning materials from USC website. They were so concise, easy to understand & fun to play without pages of useless blabber. Then I found out the author, Bert Ligon, has written several books on jazz theory & improvisation. After studying with Bert Ligon's materials, it was easier for me to skim through Mark Levine's book and pick out the necessary info. But frankly, I'd rather sell this book and stick with Bert Ligon's.
0743289412|1.0|found book very boring, just was not able to get into it. I am a big fan of stephen king but would not recomond this book
B00005J8JL|5.0|I got this for Christmas a few years ago. The first one I received had two disc 2's. Amazon immediately sent me a new one. I don't think I even had to return the goofed-up one.    Anyway, like I said, got it for Christmas and loved it! I still love it. Now, I don't have the LP, but the mini version is near perfection. The only problem (which is minor) is that the disc slipcases are a little smaller than the outer cutout case. That means that the pictures on the individual sleeves don't match up with the cutouts 100%. But it's not really a big deal. I still enjoy it. And I have yet to mention the remastered sound. It's almost as good as sitting in on a recording session. Clear and crisp.    Well, that's my 2 cents. If you choose to buy this, I hope you enjoy it as much as I.
B000Y7ZHCU|3.0|I was really excited to receive this 2 disc DVD for Christmas as I am an avid lover of Celine and I saw her show in Las Vegas twice before it closed. I must say that I was disappointed in the Concert portion of the DVD, not because of quality, but because I saw the show in 2003 and 2005 and found those 2 shows to be much better than this final product. The song choices, the costumes, her energy... all were much more pleasing to me in the conception of this production. The one added plus to this concert is River Deep, Mountain High. Aside from that, so much of Franco Dragone's original concept was not nearly as effective as when it opened.  All in all, very enjoyable... I'm just glad I saw the performance's back when they were sensational.  I could have done without the backstage stuff... yes, it's fun to see some of it... but it's no big deal. Quite honestly, too much of the beginning in her limo and dressing room makes her out to be one big diva with an attitude she can do without.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Long awaited and brilliantly restored, Richard Lester's second romp with the Beatles reinforces how truly wonderful and timeless their music is.    The \\"Ticket To Ride\\" ski-slope sequence is an absolute classic.  Disc 2 is loaded with information as well.  This is a 'must have' for any Beatles fan, and we are legion.
1416911049|4.0|Uglies takes place in a utopian/dystopian (yes, it can be both) America several hundred years in the future. In this future, everyone turns \\"pretty\\" (ie, has a surgery to bring one's body and face to a physical point which is very close to average, and biologically pleasing) on their sixtreenth birthday - and pretties are not only beautiful, but vapid, vain, and entirely focused on having fun.    Tally is looking forward to the operation and being able to rejoin her friend Peris, until her friend Shay shows her a different option: run away to the wildnerness and the Smoke, never turn pretty but keep your own choices. When Shay herself runs away to the Smoke, leaving Tally behind to have the operation she is so looking forward to, the authorities (Special Circumstances) offer Tally a terrible choice: go after Shay and turn her and the Smoke in, or never. Ever. Have the operation and turn pretty. The choices she makes and the information she discovers changes her life forever.    I found it hard to get through the first few chapters. Until Tally meets Shay, she is as vapid as the pretties she is eager to join. However, once the two girls meet, the books just FLIES. The only reason it took me two days to finish it instead of one is because I started it very late in the night and didn't want to stay up until dawn.    This is truly a book I would recommend to any fan of young adult fiction and/or sci-fi.
1594489505|4.0|Another fantastic novel by Khaled Hosseini.  Before reading this novel, I heard whispers that this was not nearly as good as Kite Runner, but I disagree with those critics.  This is just as phenomenal of a read, and an even more heart-wrentching story.  Hosseini has the talent of giving the reader the same pain of the main characters.  This is not a lite read at all, but I would suggest it to all.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I watched this for the first time when I was very short of choices in regards to entertainment. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie was well-written and the musical numbers extremely charming. I found the bad guys suitably evil and the animation well-done. This version has some excellent background information on an alternate title sequence and some other bits and pieces on deleted scenes and that sort of thing. Definitely worth having.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Amazing, Great, Fun... what else can I say, if you love the Beatles, a MUST have Movie and CD.  If you don't aren't familiar with the Beatles... You'll be an INSTANT fan!    I was amazed at how WELL and entertaining the movie was and INSTANTLY fell in love with the songs and how they were performed to tell an amazing story.  The leads and supporting cast are AMAZING and the name star cameos/songs and FUN and a nice addition to the STRONG musical story... A MUST see/hear and HAVE!    As always, Amazon had the BEST price!
0792839749|5.0|Crafted in the days before cinematic computerization and without the crutch of live animation, this children's classic strongly withstands the test of time. A simple fable of good conquering evil, the story nevertheless conveys messages of love, faith and loyalty, all delightfully plackaged in brilliant costuming, music, and cinematography.
0783225857|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movie Greorgy Peck love him in this movie, All the characters in this movie was great I had my friend watch this she never seen it I was shock I saw this movie when I school,She watch it love it. I strongly recommend this movie it is a eye opener for all.
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album is an excellent work of art and is perhaps the greatest rock and pop double album of all time.     Some critics claim that the haphazard mix of tunes from Honey Pie to Blackbird to Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey failed to highlight a cohesive, artistic direction. I retort that this classic was crossover before crossover was in the vernacular of pop music. Thus, The Beatles, upon this release, added a new, somewhat bipolar dimension in the psychological realm of music.     Despite the apparentness that the myriad ranges and themes did not come close to mirroring one another, The White Album recordings revealed that The Beatles knew how to amalgamate all the chaos as they had earlier done with Revolver. As they did several times previously, they masterfully assorted an excellent blend of tracks, ranging from acoustic numbers to electric guitar moments to the soulful piano tunes that had been their trademark for so long.    Back then, and even now, any other group or performer that would or did dare to perform Back in the USSR or Helter Skelter would likely sound little more than a mere garage band. Thus, The White Album was and is another testament that The Beatles are arguably the greatest pop and rock group ever.
B000002QWD|5.0|Bing is the best!  This album has Christian Christmas music, as well as Christmas-y music too.  His mellow voice and excellent orchestral accompaniment makes for the best Christmas album available.  The Andrew Sisters on \\"Jingle Bell\\" is a nice treat too.  I highly recommend this album.  FIVE STARS!
B000PMGS8G|4.0|This all new Flash Gordon re-mastered special edition is great for anyone still looking to own Flash on DVD.  Admittedly, this DVD could have been better.  There is no director or actor commentary on this DVD and not as many special features as I would like for a $20 DVD, for god sakes, where is the second disk!  With all that aside Flash Gordon is one of my favorite films from my youth and still holds a place for me in cinema history as a defining character, and film in the science fiction genre.<br /><br />Flash Gordon is the precursor to the Superman archetype, the golden boy, all-American, brave and courageous with moral fortitude.  All the chicks dig `em and all the dudes what to be him.  This film is campy and has so many fun cheese ball moments, much like the Batman TV show from this era.  It's loud, boisterous, and brightly colored.  This sci-fi extravaganza of thrills and heroic themes features one mortal man saving the world from an evil war monger, Ming the merciless.  Ming is one of the great villains in cinema history. And Flash, with his perfectly quafft blonde feathered locks, goes down as one of the greatest American heroes in fantasy and sci fi lore.  Who hasn't heard of Flash Gordon?<br /><br />This film is from the era that gave us Buck Rodgers and later Battle Star Galactica and this one stands above the others.  This film is basic good vs. evil.  This film is everything a bad film should be, but for some unknown reason it's not, it works!  Bad special effects, terrible dialog and hilarious costumes only add to the charm of this classic.  The best thing in this film, aside from Flash playing football with the empiral guards, is the sound track from Queen.  it will send shivers down your spine.  You will tingle with excitement when the drum beat kicks in.  It's really an amazing moment that few films have ever been able to duplicate.<br /><br />There are many underlying sexual themes resonating in this film that is a reflection of the time it was created, this is the ultimate 70's sci-fi epic.  Flash almost dies about four times in this film and you get the notion he might not be the smartest hero, but he's spirited, and almost flawlessly pure of heart and you just know he's gonna save the day, get the girl and make it back in time to play for the Jets on Sunday.  The chicks are also pretty 1970's type hot as well, another plus!<br /><br />The other great thing on this disk is the original episode of the movie serial from the 30's; it is gut bustlingly bad and is almost worth watching all on its own.  Priceless stuff.  Just wait to you see the \\"Savages\\" that flash has to fight in the pit of doom.  He never even thoughts a punch, he just picks everyone up and tosses them around.  The costumes of the space guards are spectacularly awful.  They look like a cross between sir lance-a-lot and the tin man.<br /><br />If you're into retro sci-fi, good natured fun or just a good ole action movie you need to check this out.e ultimate 70's sci-fi epic.

0805083367|4.0|\\"Baby Bear, Baby Bear, What Do You See?\\" asks the title character and, more importantly, the young reader/listener what they see as they turn through the pages of this wonderful book.  Like \\"Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See?,\\" this book is filled with brilliant, big and colorful pictures from Eric Carle.  Bill Martin, Jr. focuses this story on North American animals, making it a bit more interesting for the kids and their parents here in the good ol' U.S. of A.  I've actually seen a few of these animals in the wild thanks to the National Park system and a few trips around my home.<br /><br />The text is familiar territory for parents and kids who've read other books by Martin, Jr.  This wonderful rythmic writing makes it easy for kids to read and, even better, more fun to listen to.  I highly recommend this book.  It's fun for all ages.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|I am an avid Ayn Rand fan, having read almost everything that she has written from her early plays, to her nonfiction work, and of course all of her novels.  I have read The Fountainhead several times, but I didn't really understand Dominique well until I saw the movie.  The movie script was actually written by Ayn Rand, and she was available to advise the stars of the movie during filming, so you can count on the fact that the movie really portrays what she meant it to portray.  To me, this is the main value of the movie.
B000W07EKW|5.0|We were so pleased with the price of this item that we couldn't resist purchasing it for ourselves during the holiday season. Not only are the movies entertaining, but the product was nicely packaged. Each film comes in it's individual case, all packaged in one Trilogy case with a sleek guide and magnetic closure. After watching all three movies in sequence, I was left asking a few questions, and the \\"Explosive\\" additional scenes of The Bourne Identity were anything but. Regardless, I would highly recommend adding this collection to your home!
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|This Movie is kind of a clash between Sin City, Troy and Braveheart! The acting, stunts, and comic like special effect's are awesome. HD-DVD is the format here (over Blu-Ray), with the Combo Format and the bluescreen picture-in-picture!  300 might be a hard movie to watch for some viewers, but the movie really tells how it was back in spartin days! A must have for any HD-DVD or DVD collector!
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Awesome concert. DVD well produced. If you haven't bought a David Gilmour DVD, this is the one to buy. Echoes live in this concert has to be one of the best live songs I've ever heard performed. The tempo shifts throughout that build to an explosive crescendo left me speechless. If you buy this DVD for just that experience alone it's worth it. On An Island in it's entirety was very well done, studio like quality from a live concert is rarely achieved, but Gilmour manages to do it yet again.  Buy this DVD, you won't be disappointed.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|Thank's to Amazon.com for the great deal on all three HD-DVD movies! I wish I never saw the movies in the theater, because it is so awesome in HD! The picture quality is amazing and the sound is awesome! (only if you have a 5.1 surround sound) Action packed features that really are amazing! Just buy them!!!!!!
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I couldn't wait for another cd from Il Divo and ordered it immediately. Not only did they surpass thier first album, but again, thrilled me with the beautiful voices these four men are gifted with.
B000W9MMPU|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because they all weren' t combo format (only Ocean's 13)! The movies are really funny and all of the stars in the films are great! The picture is flawless, sound is amazing and features to steal a lot of hours from your day! A must for any HD-DVD collector!!!!!
B000V1Y43W|5.0|anyone who has blueray (PS3) device should REALLY buy this movie....<br />picture/sound are PERFECT
B000V6BE6C|5.0|I have been a fan of Avenged Sevenfold since the Waking the Fallen album blazed into the metal arena.  The harsh screams and ultra-heavy riffs were amazing.  With the City of Evil album, not much had changed.  It was definitely more mainstream metal, but there was still a high degree of anger and rebellion behind the music.  This new self-titled CD is completely different from their older music- but change is good.    One of the unique aspects of this amazing group is that listeners got to experience their musical evolution.  They were always a fresh flavor, but the new album shows an incredible command of almost all musical styles.  It is a beautiful thing.  The songs may not speak to the last generation of listeners, but many enjoy the new taste for their musical tongues.
B000MQ54OY|4.0|VERY nice movie.. excellent picture yet good sound = need to improve format( PCM/DTS or THX)
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This is a MUST SEE Film for all American citizens - That includes all members of the US Congress! While I have criticized Moore in the past for being somewhat rude to the NRA president, he shows nothing but the truth in this brilliant documantary.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I watched the clock hoping that it would end quickly and put me out of my misery.  Complete disaster.  I found myself laughing although it is certainly not intended as  a comedy.  Jackman and Beckinsale must have gotten huge paydays to agree to be part  of this garbage.  The acting is so bad, and the characters so undeveloped, that at the end,  you honestly don't care who wins or if they all die.  You just want it to end.  Even the CG  effects are poor when compared to other films of similar genre.   Take my advice, save your  money, and just stick some needles under your fingernails instead to get the same amount  of enjoyment.
B00006DEF9|5.0|This is the best movie I have ever seen.  I absolutely love it!  My mom tells me that when I was just one day old, I laid in her arms and watched it with her in the hospital room with him.  12 years later I watched it again when I visited her for the summer.  I watched it everyday that I was there.  It was so wonderful and romantic!!  Now that I got it for Christmas, I plan to watch it over and over again with my own baby girl!!
0316236535|5.0|This is a great book. My two year old daughter attends preschool two mornings a week and the teacher read this book for Halloween and hasn't stopped since. She even bought each of the kids in the class a copy for Christmas. The kids love it. They run around the room screaming and playing and pretending to hide. My daugter has the story memorized with and without the book in front of her. It's great fun, especially if the person reading it aloud is animated and really brings it to life.
B000XFCPHI|5.0|A great soundtrack for those who adore this movie. Magical and haunting. Great for children and adults.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|The movie is one of the best Walt Disney movies created in my opinion. I was very excited to purchase this movie for my 2 year old daughter, only to be disappointed. The quality of the DVD I received was awful. The DVD came in a blank sleeve not even the right movie casing (no movie casing). I paid full price for a poorly burned DVD. Also, the entire movie has captions on the bottom of the screen that are permanently there for the entire movie taking up most of the screen. I am very unsatisfied with the seller of this product. I expected a lot more for what I paid and I am expecting a full refund from the seller.

0140861629|1.0|If you are looking for an audio recording of Virginia Woolf's complete book, be cautious here.  Neither the Amazon site nor the sellers necessarily tell you whether you are getting an abridged or unabridged version.  I ordered what turned out to be an abridged version.  The seller took it back, but without telling me I would end up paying the shipping both ways (which exceeded the price of the item) -- all for an error that was theirs, not mine. Neither Amazon nor the seller get any points for this kind of abuse of customers.
B000002HJR|5.0|NOLA ranks as one of my fav CDs. I had grown a bit weary of the \\"look how rapidly I can play\\" metal in exclusive vogue back then, and look who came out with an album that would make early Sabbath (Geezer to this day) super-proud? Jimi would dig it too, yes. This album showcases the guys' influences and they are clearly happy to do so. So you hear Hendrix-influenced riffs, even brief leads (respectfully brief: No one will ever dare mimic the Master; it's an exercise in futility); the overwhelming presence of early Black Sabbath bone-crushing, freight-train chugging heavy rock riffing is just inescapable unless you are profoundly deaf, and even then you would feel the vibrations... As for the Southern influence, IDK. Lynyrd Skynyrd?! Here?! People keep talking about how NOLA evokes the South, and conjures up images of guys jammin' in some shed, all muddied, with scorching and humid air mixing with the herb inhaled. C'mon: That's a bunch of patronizing nonsense! I hail from the South, and to me this is a classic heavy rock album, period. Great rock is saturated with Southern influences by default. See, all REAL rock owes Southern music a major debt, because it evolved from the Delta Blues--the Mississippi Delta of course. It evolved from the shamelesslessly plagiarized music of Willie Dixon, Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, and the list goes on and on and on. IMHO, NOLA isn't much more \\"Southern\\" than Sabbath's debut, for instance. Both grind you to a pulp with the bluesiest heavy rock you can imagine and you know you want it. The vocals are spooky and festooned with Spanish moss and kudzu even in Sabbath's northerly latitude rock where the moss and vines are of quite different varieties. But this isn't Botany 101. It's about the music, y'all; it's about its roots! In hindsight, how funny is it that \\"music critics\\" lambasted Sabbath for aping Zep? Those idiots would've done the same to Down if they were Zep contemporaries. On the one hand you had a 100% blues-infused brilliantly sludgy heavy and heady overdriven spooky (like Robert Johnson was spooky with Hellhounds on My Trail) rock band that hailed the leaf like its progeny Down, and on the other hand you had a proto-metal band that was excellent but also very cocky, rude and naughty, plagiarizing Muddy Waters and Little Milton et al. early on. (I'm so glad that Muddy won the law-suit for the ripped off Whole Lotta Love.) and experimented a bit with Celtic and acoustic genres. In short, if it's real rock, it's Southern. I always find it pathetic--disturbing, too--when some uber-losers brand themselves as a \\"white power\\" rock band. Black Metal had (still has, C.f. NSBM) a few of those ignorant beasties as did punk. The joke is on them: The scales that they are playing (poorly in most cases) were developed by black men (and women, I imagine). So perhaps they should return to their truly (or alleged) Nordic roots, and play accordion muzik and such? As always, this is all about opinion. Your opinion might differ, but it's no more accurate than mine. Of course, if it's fueled by stupidity, cluelessness or hate, mine is SUPERIOR to yours. You need to go meet your Maker and pay your dues to the Grim Reaper, and do it sooner rather than later. If you respect others and practice the golden rule, then...cool. So just have a good time ... all of the time. That's my philosophy.

0525950079|2.0|This book is too long and it is not worth it.  \\"Pillars\\" was worth the reading and after you were done you wanted to keep on reading.  I couldn't wait to be done with \\"World without End.\\"  The story was not well developed, neither where the characters and the plot.  Besides, there were times in which the scenes and issues felt like they were taken from \\"Pillars\\" and included in this novel.  Disappointing.
1844138518|5.0|Wired magazine packs some of the best technology writers and new economy experts in the world, and with this book Chris Andersen asserts his position as the leader of the pack. This book has the right mix of the essential ingredients of a good business book: enough rigor for business theory but not so much as to make it dry; enough anecdotes to bring the point home but not so much as to make it repetitive; enough opinions and wit to make the reader question but not so much as to make it biased and shallow.<br /><br />Like all mainstream business books, this one does not resist the temptation to encapsulate all business and socio-cultural phenomena around one simple theory. However, Anderson maintains the humility to admit discovery than claim invention. Expect this concept to become as widespread and oft-quoted (if not more) in understanding the digital consumer economy, than [[ASIN:0060517123 Geoffrey Moore's Chasm]] was/is in understanding the evolution of hi-tech products.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|This is a great album, poignant and chock-full of talent. \\"Apologize\\" is the song that first brought OneRepublic to my attention but all the songs reveal an immense talent.     My personal favorites are \\"Say (All I Need)\\", which has a gorgeous melody and touching lyrics; \\"Stop and Stare\\", I'm hoping this is their next single; \\"Apologize\\" (original version), a masterpiece of a song; and \\"Prodigal\\" beautiful and yearning.     I enjoyed both versions of \\"Apologize\\" but the original version sounds more elemental and unique. I really don't understand why Timbaland gets so much credit for that song. Tedder wrote the music and lyrics for it. All Timbaland did was replace the castanets and violin (unfortunately), with a techno-beat and his \\"eh\\" call. It doesn't cover any new territory like the original does, which is a really great song.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|No problems with the seller or receiving the product in a timely manner. Came sealed, new packaging. No problems or issues.
B000Q6GX5Y|2.0|The film is good at reflecting what is basically a comic book version of a war supposedly fought a long time ago between the Greeks and the Persians. The story is based on a deranged comic book writer who views history from an us versus them point of view and somehow decides that Greek culture is western culture.    Anyway coming back to the movie, the whole movie is made up in the studio and shows it with the graphics very unreal and the images blurry and dull. The movie is very gory and is just an exercise in sword and spear piercing of the human flesh.    It is basically a comic book made into a film and should appeal to those who view death and destruction as a past-time to be enjoyed.    The quality of the film as a blu ray movie is not fantastic nor is the sound track.

B000VBJEEG|2.0|You expect a certain kitschy approach to American animation: the sight jokes,contemporary wordplay and overwrought effort to endear its hero or heroine to the audience. But this DVD was disappointing! The topic of French cooking and culinary art offers a field day for creative animation which the producers of this so-so effort failed to grasp. At least there was one attempt to educate the public regarding the chef, sous chef, line cook, and their duties. The plot was too simplistic and the heavy-handed attempt to inject menace through the accepted belief in the nature of rats as thieves killed the hero rat chef's well-meaning naivete.
B000000OQF|1.0|First of all, in Axl Rose, we have one of the worst vocalists in the history of rock- indeed, when I listen to some of these songs (such as \\"It's So Easy\\" and \\"Think About You\\") I wonder why the hell anybody thought it'd be a good idea to give this twerp the mic. He tries painfully hard to sound like a combination of Bon Scott and Johnny Rotten, and winds up completely missing the point- he doesn't have an ounce of the former's boozehound charisma or the latter's seething menace. Instead, he comes off sounding like the whiney, egotistical, self-righteous blowhard that he is, attacking these songs with the kind of banshee screech usually reserved for drunken frat guy idiots at three in the morning. He's annoying, repetitive, unoriginal, and moronic. Naturally, he thinks he's a genius.     The rest of the band is better- Bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Steven Adler make for a pretty good rhythm section. Besides, Duff has a really cool name. In addition, Izzy (Stradlin) and Slash are excellent guitarists- they have a way with face melting solos and jackhammer riffs. Too bad they were given such horrible songs to work with.    I mean, what the hell is supposed to be so good about these songs? I don't even like the big 3: \\"Paradise City\\" is annoyingly repetitive, with an incredibly dull chorus that spills into excruciatingly cheesy verses. It's about as hard-rockin' as your least favorite arena pop anthem, and its dated just as well (i.e., horribly). \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" fares a bit better: Axl's lyrics are pure bad boy posturing, but the riff is cool and there's some real attitude to the whole thing. Still, it isn't that hard rock masterpiece that some see it as. And if you ask me, \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" is an unbelievably overrated power ballad with a dull melody and some painfully insincere vocals.     Those three tracks set the template- this album is full of labored, unoriginal sleaze rock (\\"Mr. Brownstone,\\" \\"Nightrain\\"), dull hard rock workouts (\\"It's So Easy,\\"whose casual misogyny is more unintentionally funny than offensive), egotistical posturing (\\"Out Ta Get Me\\"), and cheesy, laughably insincere balladry (\\"Think About You\\" is excruciating where \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" is merely annoying). \\"You're Crazy\\" is pure fake sleaze, and \\"Anything Goes\\" is instantly forgettable.    There are a few decent songs here- \\"My Michelle\\" is suitably tough and funky, and \\"Rocket Queen\\" has an okay chorus, even though those annoying sexual moans during the instrumental break make want to kill somebody. Still, even the best moments here are little more than mediocre. Plus, the whole thing has this really glitzy 80s production that's just irritating as hell. This is absolute crap.
