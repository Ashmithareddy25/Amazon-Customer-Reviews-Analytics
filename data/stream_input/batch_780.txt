0316010669|4.0|While it sounds by the title like it's a self-help book for the decisionally challenged, the book is actually a compendium of information about attitudes, prejudices, information and decision making, and what constitutes an expert decision maker.<br /><br />The book is interesting but somewhat rambling in character.  The information seems a little disconnected, and I was at times hard put to it to decide if I were being encouraged or discouraged from using the unconscious part of my decision making apparatus for making judgments.  By the end I could hear the distinct echoes of the Delphic Oracle's famous \\"Know thyself\\" reverberating through my mind.<br /><br />Like so much offered advice, in the end the distillation of all the information the author provides us is that sometimes it's a good idea and sometimes it's not.  In the sometimes it's a good idea I can definitely find a resonance.  As a college student I found that if I didn't do what I thought I \\"should\\" be doing I didn't do anything at all.  By the time I had gotten to graduate school however, I had discovered that my subconscious mind was able to dictate when I needed to get busy with classroom projects, and it was always right too.  I finally decided that it knew what I had to do, how much time I had, what my resources were, what the likely expectations of the professor were, and what my abilities were.  Once I grew to rely on this subconsious sense of \\"do it now,\\" I no longer felt guilty about doing other things and got a whole lot more done in the bargain.<br /><br />Certainly the author's information on the research into default setting prejudices like black equals bad and white equals good was an eye opener.  I have no doubt that despite my pleasant interactions with black individuals as friends and coworkers I also harbor an embarrassing default setting.  When I realize how much a part the media play in this programing, I am amazed that race relations aren't worse than they are.  It would appear that most of us are able to deal rationally with our irrational prejudices, thank God.  Definitely the sketch of the disastrous death of an innocent black man in New York City at the hands of the police was a horror story about rational thinking short circuited.  The tragedy was so appalling, it's difficult to realize how complex and physiological it all must have been and how totally out of control. Likewise the description of  violence that occurred in Florida was also frightening and makes one understand how group behavior can so thoroughly take over.  That the frenzied speeches of Adolph Hitler and the charged mass behavior could lead to a world war is not quite so surprising when one realizes that crazy things can happen with as few as four or five people under unusual conditions.  What's truely sad is that much of the data on predjudice and group think and authority figures has been known for decades with very little done to change it.<br /><br />More surprising still was the study of military fact finding and its effect on decision making.  The Red-Blue war game was especially informative.  That the complexity of war should make it unpredictable should hardly be surprising.  Murphey's Law should see to that, goodness knows.  I was surprised that the author didn't discuss emergent properties or some of the findings on chaos theory.  Surely Stuart Kaufman's or Per Bak's names should have arisen at least once, but--as I recall, anyway--they didn't.<br /><br />All in all, while the book seemed like a string of observations rather than a coherent whole, I found the information of great interest.<br /><br />Intriguing.able to deal rationally with our irrational prejudices, thank God.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|After further deliberation, I decided to write a review after all, even 2 years after the movie came out.  Despite certain things, the movie over all was awesome.  Can you believe that I watched it every night for 7 nights in a row? It is insane, but so is the movie.    Let me start off saying that this is by far the best Mr. Rochester I have seen.  Toby Stephens does a terrific job portraying Rochester. Yes, he is not as tyrannical as in the book, but his expressions, his speech, the way he moved was simply wow.  It was refreshing to see Mr. Rochester humorously sparring with Jane, it was refreshing to see the wit in him, the vulnerability, the shadows that just haunt him all the time, and it is just as refreshing seeing his face lighten up upon him seeing Jane.   While in the book, Mr Rochester acted like a spoiled brat of a baby, in the movie Mr Rochester is an enigmatic, strong, morose and cynical person who still showed vulnerability, and thus seemed human.    Jane was good as well, she did not need to speak, her eyes said it all.  I liked her shyness, and her spark and spunk, I liked her humorous flirtations, as well as her unhappiness and despair.  I cant say much about her because the true acting belonged to Toby.  But what an enigmatic pair they are.     People are complaining about the heated passionate scene in her bedchamber, about too much kissing and probably (in my opinion) fondling.  But look, no matter what period Bronte wrote this book, people were still people back then, full of sexual passions, tensions, and sexual love.  It was very nice indeed to see the scene after Jane saves Rochester from fire, it was very pleasant and erotic no less to see the scene of him laying on top of her, and kissing.  Common now, sex is sex in every century, in every culture, and in every society.    My only complaint is that the camera work could have been better; other than that technicality, great job!    PS NOW I have a crush on Mr Rochester and Toby:)
B0014I4KIK|4.0|...something better comes along.  Duffy is such a marvelous find, honestly, a great voice with a great vision.  Her debut album `Rockferry' beautifully builds anticipation for her growth as an artist and leaves the listener very, very satisfied.  The album is not perfect, and I do have a few issues with some tracks, but as a whole it cannot be denied the talent this young singer possesses.  She reminds me of a more soothing Amy Winehouse; maybe even slightly better.  I love la'Winehouse, and it must be noted that collectively `Back to Black' is a finer album that `Rockferry', but I can't help but feel in my gut that Duffy has the superior vocals.<br /><br />In my humble opinion this album really kicks itself off with the fantastic `Serious', a track that plays off of Duffy's smooth vocals, the lyrics shimmering down on us like a silky rainstorm.  On `I'm Scared' she reaches new heights of brilliance, perfectly capturing the mood and essence of the ballad.  Her vocal progression towards the stunning chorus lines is essential to the power of the song, and she astounds me every time I listen to this track.  The way her voice hits the word \\"scared\\" sends chills down my spine, the subtle crack in her voice as she peaks right before our ears.  `Hanging on too Long' is a beautiful example of subtlety and restrained working out for greatness.  It's a sincere song that touches the listener.<br /><br />Just listen to her construction of `Syrup & Honey', which calls to mind another vocal favorite of mine; country singer Julie Roberts.  The guitar work and the microphone effects just blow me away here; adding yet another layer to this masterful talent.  Her vocals on the words \\"baby, baby, baby\\" just swarm my heart.<br /><br />`Delayed Devotion' has such an infectious beat, such a driving force behind Duffy's beautiful vocals.  This has almost a Motown sound to it; and I totally dig that.  And then of course you have the brilliant `Mercy'; her single which has garnered her immense hype; rightfully so since `Mercy' is a flawless single.  Her voice sounds the most Winehouse-like on this track, and she nails it marvelously.  The nasally delivery is intriguing and quite sensual.  The track is the most fun on the album, and it shows in her impeccable delivery.  You can tell she is having a blast singing this, and I for one have a blast listening to it.<br /><br />And this brings me to my favorite track here; `Stepping Stone'.  This was actually the first track I heard off this album.  Everyone I know was telling me that I would love this girl based on her single `Mercy' but I hardly listen to the radio and thus had yet to hear the song.  I looked her up regardless and had a chance to listen to `Stepping Stone', and her voice just took me to another place.  Her voice is very mature on this track; reminding me of Joss Stone almost.  Joss is still, in my humble opinion, the better singer, but she reaches Joss levels of control and maturity on this beautiful track.  The song is just effortlessly inviting, complete and constructed masterfully.  It is a perfect track; utterly perfect.<br /><br />Now, like I said, I have a few issues with some of the tracks here.  The first two tracks on the album (`Rockferry' and `Warwick Avenue') are a little too bland for my liking.  Her voice is impeccable on both tracks, but the tracks in general are a little redundant (especially `Warwick Avenue') and a little boring.  I also don't care for the closing track `Distant Dreamer', which just sounds off when compared to the balance of the album.  She sounds great, but the song just isn't.  It sounds like an 80's pop ballad to me; very not cool.<br /><br />In the end, this is definitely an album to pick up for it is very satisfying.  The bulk of the album is flawless; especially tracks like `I'm Scared', `Syrup & Honey', `Mercy' and `Stepping Stone'; those four being more than enough reason to invest the money.  Duffy has a long career ahead of her.  She is coming out in a time when this breed of music is being openly embraced, and her beautiful vocals will insure her acceptance into our ears, homes and hearts.  Between Duffy, Joss, la'Winehouse and my current obsession Leela James I am beside myself with the amazing music infiltrating my eardrums.<br /><br />Isn't it nice to be bombarded by talent as apposed to the endless cascades of trash that is so often forced upon us?t in a time when this breed of music is being openly embraced, and her beautiful vocals will insure her acceptance into our ears, homes and hearts.

B0014I4KIK|4.0|Listening to Duffy's first single Mercy I was hooked immediately and interested in what more she had to sing.  I love her voice, it's unique and beautiful.  The songs are soulful without being too over the top.  It's just right.  I would compare Mercy to Rehab by Amy Winehouse.  To me Amy is still the queen by Duffy comes in a close second.    Best Tracks:  Im scared  Rockferry  warwick avenue  mercy  serious
1576754499|5.0|This book summarizes Mr. Polak's work with his company, IDE (International Development Enterprises), which focuses on creating affordable, useful products that can assist small-plot farmers in developing countries to increase their income.  Throughout, he presents salient and frankly obvious points about the very poor and their needs that most aid organizations either ignore or just never thought to address.  For instance, from his introduction:  \\"The biggest reason most poor people are poor is because they don't have enough money.\\"  See?  Obvious.<br /><br />The point is, however, most aid organizations don't address this root problem, choosing instead to go for big, showy projects that cost a lot and sound really ambitious, but just don't do anything to benefit the average very poor family.  Polak suggests a twelve point plan to create programs that can really benefit the very poor.  These include things like talking to people with the problem you are interested in, and really listening to what they have to say about it; learning everything possible about the problem's specific context; thinking in terms of scalability; developing measurable outcomes; and designing to specific cost and price targets.<br /><br />The book tells the story of how one family in Bangladesh was able to move from barely surviving on less than $1 a day and not having enough food to make it through the year to relative prosperity and a much more comfortable lifestyle.  This was made possible in part by their access to affordable, small-scale irrigation equipment, allowing them to make more effective use of their other resources - their land and their physical labor.  Polak points out that when families can earn more money, they almost automatically do things like improve their diets, further their education, seek better healthcare, and generally become more empowered to improve their lives in the ways they see fit, according to their own priorities.<br /><br />It took some mental acrobatics for me to begin to accept the concept of dollar a day farmers as \\"consumers\\" rather than \\"aid recipients.\\"  But as a market this group has a huge, untapped potential.  There are something like 800 million small farmers; the combined purchasing power (given the right products and a little access to credit) would be enormous.  Overall, I found this book engaging and its message hopeful and practical.  It certainly provides food for thought.o accept the concept of dollar a day farmers as \\"consumers\\" rather than \\"aid recipients.\\"  But as a market this group has a huge, untapped potential.

0066620996|5.0|I like the way 'Good to Great' outlines many corporate leadership attributes, especially discipline, which is rare these days. I can honestly say Mr Collins' book is helping my company go from OK-ordinary-good to great, as shown by our bottom line. Lately, I picked up the book by Norman Thomas Remick, '..Going Beyond Leadership of Character..', and I can honestly say it is already helping me, personally, to grow as a leader, and is the 'Good to Great' counterpart dealing, not with taking a business or corporation from OK-ordinary-good to great, but taking an individual from good to great in leadership. The Collins book is obviously the gold standard for companies, the Remick book is the new guy on the block for ambitious leaders of character.

0307383415|4.0|Barack Obama must be the only person on the planet with a background like this: son of a free-spirited young woman who married a black student from Kenya while living in Hawaii with her parents, her father a World War II veteran seeking his fortune as a salesman and her mother a career woman who did not want to be called \\"Grandma.\\" The family had come to Hawaii because Gramps (he didn't mind being called that) asked for a transfer when he learned the furniture company he worked for was opening a store there. And so their daughter happened to meet the first Barack Obama who happened to have gotten a scholarship to study at the University of Hawaii. It was not clear that their marriage was ever legal, as we learn later in the book that the senior Barack already had a wife in Kenya. The union did not last, but it left a legacy - a son, the young Barack Obama who tells us his story, a moving account of his journey toward reconciling the two parts of himself.<br /><br />Clearly, he loved his mother, and she never stopped loving him or wanting the best for him, even while her idyllic dreams faded as the enigmatic Kenyan left her to study at Harvard, then go back to his other women in Kenya. She married an Indonesian student and took young Barack to live in Indomesia, where he learned to play with other kids of various shades of brown, and struggled with the poverty and corruption that seemed to permeate life there. Finally, his mother decided he had to go back to his grandparents in Hawaii, to better schools and better opportunities. Gramps called in all his favors and was able to get young Barack into the best school on the island. The author tells us that this first experience with affirmative action had nothing to do with being black. It had everything to do with grandparents who loved their grandson.<br />His life with the grandparents who made him a priority in their lives defined a happy childhood. While the racial difference did not infect their family life, at times it still intruded. He relates the story of a man hassling his grandmother as she waited for a bus, and the shock he felt when Gramps tells him that the man who frightened Toot was black. This bothered Gramps, but he was right away sorry he had told his grandson. Full of contradictory feelings about his own racial identity, Obama goes to see an old black poet who Gramps liked to hang out with. The man explained (in his own poetic way) that a white man can be comfortable with a black man, come over and fall asleep in his house and be buddies, but, said the old black poet, the white man can never understand what it really feels like to be black, and that \\"your grandma's right to be scared... she understands that  black people have a reason to hate.\\" The chapter concludes with the words \\"and I knew for the first time that I was utterly alone.\\"<br /><br />In his aloneness, he goes to college in California, then moves to New York. He matter-of-factly tells us that the person who offered him a place to stay was not in his apartment when, suitcase in hand, fresh off the subway, he showed up and rang the doorbell. With no place to stay and not enough money for a hotel, the future Senator (future President?) SLEPT IN AN ALLEY! I was astounded to read this, and thought of my own daughter, who also went off with just a few bags and not much money to find her future in the Big Apple. I hope she never slept in an alley.<br /><br />Unsatisfied with a professional suit-and-tie job, Obama gets it in his head that he wants to be a community organizer. He sends out resumes, he quits the good job, he goes down to his last dollar before taking a job offered by a scruffy white guy to work in some tough neighborhoods of Chicago.<br /><br />His experiences with the poor people of Chicago are poignant and related with an honesty and refreshing lack of boasting. No, he didn't wipe out poverty and racism,  and some of his efforts fell flat, but he learned a lot about himself as well as what life is like for poor people who feel powerless. And he had a few successes.<br /><br />It's hard to say whether the first part of the book, with all those early experiences, was the best part, or the last part where he takes us along on his trip to Kenya, to try to reclaim the elusive father he never really knew. He has met his father only once, back in Hawaii at the fancy school where the other kids, learning his father was African, asked if his father ate people, and young Barack makes up stories to hide his feelings about not knowing his own father. And he endures the tortured worry when his father is invited to speak to the school children about Africa, and savors the vindication and relief when the kids actually enjoy the black man's tales about the faraway place called Kenya. His father teaches him to dance, then disappears from his life, except for a now and then letter.<br /><br />The book shifts quickly into the Kenyan story, a little too abruptly. But I was soon lost in the tale of all the family, trying to keep straight who was related to who and how. It must have been a bit like that too for the author, who found his lost family in many ways not as he thought they'd be, but in other ways more wonderful than he expected. He traced the path his grandfather Onyango had taken, from Luo tribesman to wearing the white man's clothes and learning their ways. But the English colonialists left, and Jomo Kenyatta, of the Kikuyu tribe, led the country as the senior Barack, son of Onyango, returned with his Harvard education, to help build a country. He did not build any wealth for his family, as the author tells us of modest houses, shared beds, traveling by rickedy bus, and using outhouses. I loved the account of going on a safari and his description of the animals. His sister Auma did not want to go (\\"safaris are for the white tourists\\") and his insistance (\\"You're letting your prejudices keep you from enjoying your own country\\"). He shows love and concern for all his African family (an incredible collection of half-brothers and sisters with mutiple mothers), but Auma has a special place in his heart. She came to see him in America and had lived and studied in Germany. She too had some of the same ambivalence about heritage. No male chauvinist Luo ways for her!<br /><br />The last chapters are also an abrupt shift. We fast-forward through the rest of Obama's life to the time he wrote the book. It's as if he wanted to tell us more, but ran out of space and just summarized the rest. I'm sure there is so much more to tell, and who knows if the years ahead will yield up an even more incredible story than this? Barack Obama seems to have finally laid to rest the ghost of his father and found his own authentic self. We are the richer that he chose to share his journey with us.feel powerless.

0316172324|2.0|Blink<br />Is there a certain standard that keeps a very interesting essay / article from turning into a book? You see, the number of bloated books that I have been reading has triggered this question. A book like Blink, which discusses an interesting concept, could have been a great article in the NYT Magazine. A well developed article with enough evidence to convince the sceptic of the author's argument. However, to go for, what it seems like 1,000 evidence of the same concept is a waste of time and gives the book a highly 'commercial' feel.<br /><br />Picking on \\"Blink\\" again, I would have paid the same $9 had it been a 50 page book. Take a cue from Ben Hogan's \\"Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf \\" an absolute classic for every golfer in less than 120 pages written some 50 years ago!<br /><br />There are many examples of these books that go on and on about one single subject and prove it with 1,000 examples. For me to do that would mean that I, also, suffer from verbal diarrhea!

I was shocked that I could really get into the movie since it was missing some of that Indy sexiness that, let's face it, he's always had before.  It had me believing everything could happen, with the exception of the refrigerator and vine-swinging parts.  And for those of you who felt that the ending was a little far-fetched, just remember that we've already fell for a killer ark of the covenant and holy grail.  Is it really that far of a leap?  On a different note, I have a friend who just came back from working a dig in Peru, and she was very excited because they really do still look like the one in the movie.  Bottom line:  Watch this movie.  Well worth standing in line at midnight for!

I think anyone who likes buffy or angel will like this show, even if they aren't into the futuristic space ship stuff like I tend not to be but after one or two episodes you're hooked then a few discs later there are is no more, the show dies off sadly, so worth the money it's just greatness, sadly canceled greatness where you'll live at least three characters if not all of them.

Adichie has a way of making you love all of the characters in different ways, and I love how she teaches you about Nigerian culture through her books--not to mention the devastating civil war that the country went through.  A lot of people are comparing Adichie to Chinua Achebe, and after reading her two books, I have to say that it is an adequate statement.

'= Hard candy.     it's also said that Madonna knows how to choose her team and surround herself with the best staff. Hard Candy also fails at tis point.          the tracks are easy to listen and lucid for comparison with usual games played by so many of them. where she is trying to use justin timberlakes old tactics to mesmerize the public and fans with his less provocative music talent and more physical presence. she failed to even tap timbaland like his works with big shots like Bjork, Mary.J. blige etc.              the worst not in any ways complementary collaboration on Hard Candy was justin timberlake.   As written in some reviews that Madonna does not believe in repeating herself.Instead she is repeating the other artists. Not even a fly first class Cd, Hard candy even fails to let know that it belongs to Madonna.            Hard Candy on the opening track it self, it seems a new artist in over populated R&B cadre is attempting to register her name with artists like Rihanaa,chritina milian etc. and then disappear in less than half decade.            the album is dumping the voices in big and heavy beats, up tempo hip hop, club beats and routine R&B footage. instead, if an R&B album is planned, the big foots like dave 'jam' hall, babyface and dallas austin on the complete album would have been fertile an attempt once again. There is noting wrong in repeating our selves when u know that u will succeed.                               Since Madonna's American Life, it goes noticed that she is trying hard to stay and push long with her name. the quantity of cryptic, fussy and haphazard material has increased in her music which does not emboss an image \\"madonna\\" and a reminiscence of this sexy queen. like she did during her R&B pop collaboration in bed time stories, the porsche Evita and also her less spoken albums like i'm breathless and true blue. the quantity of cd's are increasing whereasshe needs to highlight 'what Madonna has always been all 'bout.'    the Big voice is becoming more into star light, starkling and concerned only about staying in the industry anyways. i tink fans are disappointed with her candy.
B000002INR|5.0|This is definitely a transitional album combining the best of glam rock with heavy metal into a classic album for the ages.<br /><br />Overall the album is just fun rock and roll, but still seems to have that deeper streetwise edge brought on by the lyrics.<br /><br />My review will consist of the best lyrics from each song:<br /><br />BIG GUNS: \\"Like Valentino with a hand grenade\\"<br />SWEET LITTLE SISTER: \\"Her Mama kill her if she knew what she do\\"<br />...HEARTACHE: \\"You held your own until it wasn't yours anymore\\"<br />PIECE OF ME: \\"I got nasty, nasty habits & that's all she's gonna get\\"<br />18 & LIFE: \\"Tequila in his heartbeat, his veins burned gasoline\\"<br />RATTLESNAKE...: \\"Cause talk is cheap and so is she\\"<br />YOUTH GONE WILD: \\"I'll tell ya Park Avenue leads ta' SKID ROW!\\"<br />HERE I AM: \\"You don't need a crystal ball, to see she's got it all\\"<br />MAKIN' A MESS: \\"Lit up a smoke and did some talkin' with the back of his hand...SMACK!\\"<br />I REMEMBER...: \\"Woke up to the sound of pouring rain\\"<br />MIDNIGHT: \\"Electric is my touch, baby, you don't know what you've got\\"<br /><br />Great riffs and great times!
B000003N8R|5.0|In the vast, almost surreally expansive litany of John Coltrane music, this CD stands out for a number of reasons. For one, it provides a glimpse of the man sort of at a cross roads, where he was still whipping out the licks he has since become famous for, but where he also delves into an improvisational method that borders on the avant-garde, and indeed - many would argue - heralds that era. Especially in the opening title track, one really has to be listening close to tell that he hasn't strayed completely away from the original melody and chords, and for me, it causes a strain that is almost tangibly tiring. But the rest of the tracks settle down into what I would call \\"traditional\\" Coltrane, where, yeah, he goes off on his own, but just when you start to get worried about him, there he is, back on the song's path through the sonic forest of swing. Another reason this CD stands out is the backing musicians. Sure, Jimmy Garrison and Elvin Jones can pick it up, lay it down, make it rock and hold it steady, whatever a song or a solo calls for, but for gosh sakes, that's McCoy Tyner on the ivories! You could just about put Tyner's name as the headliner and consider Trane as a member of the backing band, and I don't think you'd be doing either one of them a disservice. When he's given a chance to shine, he does, and his solos really complement and contrast Trane's in an unorthodox but satisfying way. This remastered edition really sounds clean and crisp throughout, and the foldout cardboard holder has generous liner notes. The music is unsurpassed. [[ASIN:B000002I4S Giant Steps]] may give you all the Coltrane you'll ever NEED, but, eventually you'll WANT more, and when you reach that point, this is the recording you should buy.
B0015YIGJC|4.0|Well I have to say... while the cd is really good, I wish they included more songs! I was present in the concert that they recorded for the CD and there were about 20 songs all the way from \\"Falta Amor\\" to their newest songs! If they included every song I'd say that it would have been FAR BETTER than \\"En Vivo\\" but it fell kinda short on that. However it is still very good and it is really exiting to listen how loud the people was singing every single son along with the band. Bottom line... RECOMMENDED!!
0307155102|5.0|I had this book as a child, although the version I had was longer and more PC.  This is a great word learning book.  The only drawback is that all the characters are animals, so it has to be for a child who knows the animals are simply playing people roles and doing people things.  I would recommend to anyone with kids.  You cannot go wrong with this book.  The older version is better since it has more pages (20 more pages), but it is hard to find in good condition and at a decent price.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|First off, I can tell you that I have always loved this movie for what it is and always has been...... a better than average sci-fi movie. It actually has a plot that makes sense, and the writers succefully intermixed the story line of 4 different groups of people until they merge at the end to 'save the world'. The effects are great.... way ahead of its time in 96. And it's got IMHO one of the best written speaches that ever hit the big screen (the president's speach to the pilots). Kudos to the writer who wrote that....it almost brings me to tears no matter how many times I watch it. And Bill Pullman does an AWESOME...let me repeat...AWESOME acting job in this movie (ex: hospital scene where he is 'loosing' his wife -the first lady).    HOWEVER...this review isn't to try and sell you on the movie. LOL! The movie is from 96, and chances are, you already know if you love or hate ID4. My opinion is not going to change that. ON THE OTHER HAND, if you love this movie....if you watched it 10 times over when it first came out.... if you were one of the crazy people who saw it at it's midnight release (*raises hand*)...then you ABSOLUTLEY HAVE to see it on Blu-Ray.     Now I already own numerous upon numerous Blu-Rays and I will be the first one to say that the technology is well worth the price tag of these disks and getting a new player. ALSO... a lot of people don't know that to properly see Blu-Ray in it's highest quality, you not only need the player and the disk...but you better be hooking it all up with HDMI cables or you are going to be loosing quality in the process. Again... it's another expenditure, but if you love your movies and are a big QUALITY FREAK...it's worth double it's price tag. It really does make a BIG difference (and the HDMI cables will even help the quality of non-blu ray's if you use them for your normal dvd player too).    But I digress...  For me, ID4 is no longer even watchable in any other format other than Blu-Ray. When I bought this I hadmy doubts as to whether or not it would be true 1080p since it was originally recorded in 96 before the technology was even a glimmer in anyone's eye (and remasters aren't always what they are cracked up to be). But trust me... they out did theirselves on this one. But don't take my word for it.... DO THIS: Buy the movie, watch it in blu-ray...and THEN go to the special content menu and watch THE ORIGINAL TEASER TRAILER. It's played in it's original format. You know? The format that we all thought looked out of this world on the big screen back in 96? Well, OMG....the difference is MIND BLOWING. STAGGERING, even! Seeing the original format after watching the blue ray version brings it all into perspective. The detail on the new Blu-Ray version in the space ships...the fire...even the buildings.... all I can say is WOW!    And apparently I'm not the only one who noticed this. I'm in the Chicago area....and I had a heckuva time finding this Blu-Ray in regular stores. Eveyone seems to be trying to get their paws on it (-May 08). Grab it thru Amazon...save yourself a headache. :)
B0013J30XG|4.0|I went on the Monday after the opening, to the big Imax theater in San Francisco.  The audience was restless before the show, perhaps with that feeling of having read the bad reviews and yet still wanting it to be good.  What surprised me is how bizarrely complicated the plot was.  Are kids going to understand it?  I barely made out the machinations of the Korean pop star Rain, though like everyone else in the theater we admired his way with English and his sheer astonishing beauty-is that really his name, \\"Rain\\"?  Got to love it.  Next to him, Emile Hirsch looked like a little boy, and John Goodman like nothing on earth.<br /><br />I did feel sorry for Christina Ricci--I'm sure she was compensated adequately for her efforts, but having to stand around and look awestruck and mumble \\"Cool beans!\\" from time to time is a precise waste of her talents, even if you don't think she has any.<br /><br />They might as well have jettisoned the scenes with the child actors playing Speed and Trixie.  They added nothing to an already long story, and theyv were awful little actors, just pointlessly amateur; might as well have done them entirely with CGI.  But basically the thrills and chills are there in the racing sequences, and the little boy playing Spritle builds up, piece by piece, a strong characterization, along with his loveable companion Chim Chim.  Even though Chim Chim was lifted right out of the Dr Dolittle stories by Hugh Lofting, where he was called Chee Chee, he's a real asset to the SPEED RACER movie and I wouldn't mind seeing him in more sequels, not only to the SPEED RACER franchise but he'd be good, say, in a new Herbie movie, or perhaps helping battle alien invaders in a new ALIEN VS PREDATOR sequel.  Whatever the genre, Chim Chim is up for it, and he can bring \\"Rain\\" along any old time, kids.
B000Y179KO|4.0|The Eagles soar on this their latest studio release and the first in many years. Their voices have aged well, the songwriting is superb and the instrumentation is first rate. If you grew up musically with the Eagles in the '70's, you'll hear many of the elements that made you love their earlier music. Several hits have already come off the album and I think there will be more. My favorite track is \\"What Do I Do With My Heart\\", a gem of a song where Glenn Frey sings lead and Don Henley sings harmony, both with great emotion. The lyrics, especially on \\"It's Your World Now\\" and \\"Do Something\\" are meaningful and poetic. Tim Schmit sings lead on a potential hit called \\"I Don't Want to Hear Any More\\" and Joe Walsh provides great guitar work throughout. This CD belongs in every Eagles fan's collection. Soar on Eagles!
0312379293|5.0|This is just a rock solid murder mystery told in clear clean English with a comprehensive conclusion.  The characters are genuine; the plot line plausable; and the dialog is crisp and witty.  This is Archer at his best--and that's a high standard.  If you don't love this book you should be arrested.
0595440096|5.0|I heard about Still Alice through a friend and, I have to say, I was not all that excited to read the novel because of the subject matter. I knew it would be a sad ending. But it was a moving story that unfolded beautifully!     I've always thought of Alzheimer's as a disease that affects people in the later stages of their lives. Although this book educates the public on early onset Alzheimer's and some of the initial signs of the disease, it does much more than that.  The author portrays a moving story of a middle aged woman with a lovingly dysfunctional family at the height of her career.  The book is told from the vantage point of Alice, the main character who has the disease. The first person perspective was incredibly realistic, and I found myself emotionally attached to the character. Her courage, perseverance, and creativity in living with the disease were brilliantly portrayed.     It's one of those books that you cannot put down and when you finish, you do not forget the story or its characters. Still Alice remains in my heart.
B0000025RI|4.0|In the same way that one becomes colder the further away from the sun travel, the quality of MJs CDs/LPs diminished the further away he departed from his best CD [[ASIN:B00005QGAT Off the Wall]]. As this is the CD after the great 1979 release, he still has something in his favor. By & large he was still blessed to be working with Quincy Jones & the under valued Rod Templeton. At this time he wasn't chasing the title of King of Pop, or following the latest trends. He was also using live instruments ( the lack of which, I feel, diluted his future CDs) Add to this base, the writing skills of Toto, the guitar skills of Eddie Van Halen, the vocal 'rap' of Vincent Price, and you have all the ingredients of a major, major hit.<br />This was the first LP (as it was then) that I ever purchased, and I still have it to this day. Whilst this release has its poppier moments ('Beat It & Thriller' being prime examples) there are some quality moments on offer. I have a soft spot for 'The Girl is mine'. Maybe because I can remember hearing it on 'Top of the Pops' and being melted away with it. 'PYT' is another favorite (co-written by James Ingram, and featuring Janet Jackson as a vocal Pretty Young Thing) the much sampled Toto offering 'Human Nature', and the gorgeous 'Lady in My Life'<br />Subsequent releases from Mr. Jackson would suffer with being compared to this big money seller, and the quality would diminish as a result
B00005JPNZ|5.0|Saw this one in Baltimore's beautiful and historic Senator Theater. It is a high-action adventure flick, like the other Indy movies. Indy might be getting older but he can still whoop arse. This time, Indy is going after a crystal skull that can pass information psychically to others (through their minds). The Russians want the skull and the FBI is snooping around too. The movie begins with a caravan of military vehicles across the desert. And that's about all I can tell you, without telling you too much, except that Karen Allen returns from the 1st Indy movie, where she was Indy's adventure girl against the Nazi's for the Arc of the Covenant. Cate Blanchette is the Russian \\"bad guy\\" in the flick. (She plays one of those smart arses that you wanna slap.) Excellent flick and a fast 2 hours. It's probably ok for most kids about age 7 and up?. (There are some skeletons and a few people get toasted with flames and shot, so, use your judgement.) I loved it and would see it again in a heartbeat (even though I thought the end was a little squirrelly)!  It's the same type adventure as the other 2 Indy movies.<br /><br />If you want to find out more about crystal skulls, you might enjoy reading \\"The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future\\" by Chris Morton. This book contains a whole lot of Mayan cultural and historical information.
B0000E6XH3|4.0|Well, what can I say? I´ve been looking this one from a long time. Japanese animation with french electronic dance music? A pretty weird combination but with excellent results.   It´s a very good release with the complete history of the videos we´ve seen on MTV. The audio quality is great but the video lacks of definition. This last point is too bad considering the excellent job done by the legendary Toei Animation Studios.   It´s a shame it doesn´t include the extras from the japanese release. They would added a great value to this item.     Can we expect a Special Edition in the future? With aspect radio modified for widescreen screens? Maybe for the Blu-Ray release??  Who knows.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Before writing this review, I noticed that there were over a dozen 1-star ratings for \\"No Code\\".  This absolutely clashed with my very positive listening experience with this album, so I went through these 1-star reviews to see what I was missing that was so negative.  I saw that many of these reviewers claimed to devoted Pearl Jam fans, and furthermore claimed that Pearl Jam had taken a major plunge, musically, with this album.  Some asserted that Pearl Jam had become too \\"mainstream\\" with this album, or insinuated that they had sold out, or that it was too dissimilar to \\"Ten\\" or \\"Vs.\\".  One person in a negative review (I forget whether it was a 1- or 2- star review) even claimed it was too \\"obscure\\".    The charge that \\"No Code\\" was too \\"mainstream\\" is specious, because there is no consensus on exactly what constitutes a mainstream sound.  I for one have not heard many (perhaps any) of the songs from this album on the radio too frequently, or recently at all for that matter, so I would be very wary of labeling this album as mainstream -- if mainstream were to carry a negative connotation, which it obviously does in this instance.    The quality of \\"No Code\\" lies in it's feeling of consistency.  All of the songs seem to meld into one another, to give a cohesive listening experience.  It's not that all the songs sound the same (or even too similar); it's more that they all seem to complement one another.  The sound is a departure (of sorts) from their previous albums, but it is not a departure from their musical integrity.  This is still a distinctively Pearl Jam album.  It is, in my estimation, also one of their best and most solid.
B000000H64|5.0|Start to finish, brutal, raw, original, memorable. All of these so called Nu Metal bands owe their existance to this album. Very few band have been sooooo copied and never given credit. With this disc Fear Factory have earned thier place in music history. A must have for any fan of the extreme.
B0000027RL|4.0|While many albums cannot stand the test of time, this is one of the few that has -- and with flying colors.  Every time \\"Even Flow\\", \\"Once\\", \\"Alive\\", \\"Black\\", or \\"Jeremy\\" comes on the radio, I ALWAYS turn the volume up.  If anyone in the car objects to one of these songs (or any other Pearl Jam songs) remaining playing, I make it known that I would be very displeased if the station were to be changed.      There is indeed a good deal of filler on this album (I don't consider Oceans  filler, however, as do some people; I think it stands on its own as a good, if subdued, song), but it is not bad filler.      \\"Ten\\" is a truly enjoyable, very re-listenable album, and a good debut.  However, I must make it known that it is not Pearl Jam's best album.  Most of their subsequent (and often lesser-known) efforts are more mature and more thought-out than \\"Ten\\".  Yet, \\"Ten\\" remains a watershed moment in the rock genre, and was the start of what would become one of the most prodigious bands of the 1990s and 2000s (and hopefully past that).
B0000028PL|4.0|This album by Living Colour, their last before their 2005 reunion, (What I think) was an attempt to keep up with the grunge bands in the early '90s.  The album has a good amount of energy to it, but there doesn't seem to be any positive messages behind the songs like in their two previous albums.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|Steven Spielberg probably felt right at home filming \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\\" and not only because he reacquainted himself with the title character. This fourth installment of the famous film series also includes extra-terrestrial elements, and I think we all know how successfully Spielberg has tackled that kind of subject matter. But that's the only new component; despite some new locations, a few new characters, and a whole new period of history, \\"Crystal Skull\\" is really no different than the first three \\"Indiana Jones\\" films. I don't mean this as a put down. If anything, it's the film's greatest strength. Formulaic stories work best in this case; we want Indy to find a supernatural ancient artifact, fight political evils, and keep his hat on during impossible action sequences. We want him to do that, and nothing more.    And he delivers. The entire film delivers, not just as a fun-filled, action-packed send up of old time Saturday afternoon movie serials, but also as a cornucopia of impressive special effects. Just about every scene is an eye-popping visual feast, and this perfectly compliments a story this blatantly unrealistic. Producer/story creator George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp unabashedly went all out conjuring up Indy's fourth adventure, a tale of political intrigue and lost civilizations and heretofore-unknown connections with an ancient alien species. Taking place in 1957 at the height of the Red Scare, a much older Dr. Henry \\"Indiana\\" Jones, Jr. (Harrison Ford) is reintroduced as a captive of the KGB, the covert operatives of the former Soviet Union. Having been betrayed by his long-time partner, \\"Mac\\" George McHale (Ray Winstone), Indy is taken to Area 51 and forced to locate a special crate in a gigantic warehouse; the mission leader, Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), believes the crate contains something important, something that will lead the Soviet's to a source of power greater than the world has ever known.Indy, as you probably guessed, energetically escapes this predicament (but not before a wonderful reference is made to an earlier \\"Indiana Jones\\" film, and I won't say any more). Unfortunately, the FBI now considers him a Person of Interest, meaning he can no longer teach Archeology. Just as he leaves for New York, he's approached by a tough-talking, knife-wielding young bike-rider named Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). He needs Indy's help; both his mother and his friend, Professor Oxley, have been kidnapped by the Soviets. All Mutt can give Indy is one of Oxley's notes, written in a dead South American language and serving as a way to find one of thirteen skulls made entirely of crystal.    Apparently, Oxley is an expert on crystal skulls, real-life ancient artifacts mysterious both in structure and origin. If, like me, you had never even heard of crystal skulls before this movie, here's a little background info: archeologists have discovered a number of crystal skulls over the years throughout Mexico, Central America, and South America. The most famous skull was the one supposedly found by Anna Mitchell-Hedges back in 1924, sculpted from a block of clear quartz. Claimed to predate all known Colombian Mesoamerican artifacts, the craftsmanship remains a mystery to this day; not only was it sculpted against the natural grain of the crystal, it also shows no evidence of chipping or scratching, and this is virtually impossible considering the primitive tools used by early civilizations. This led to myths about the skull having supernatural powers, being able to radiate psychic energy and possibly being of alien origin.    Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's get back to the movie. Indy's and Mutt travel to Peru and find a half-insane Oxley (John Hurt) and Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), Indy's old flame from \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\" Naturally, they also find Spalko and her Soviet goons. This kick starts a frenetic race to a temple deep within the jungles of Brazil, where the final climactic scenes take place. You can rest assured that all this is loaded with action, with sequences including a swordfight atop two moving army vehicles, Mutt swinging from vines with a pack of monkeys, and three gigantic waterfalls, all of which Indy, Marion, and Mutt go down. Never mind the fact that they survive--as they climb out of the water, we immediately realize that Indy's hat remained in place the entire time.    If the excitement and fun of \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\\" and \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" left a definite impression on you, then you're well on your way to loving every minute of \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\\" The plot may be original, but the spirit hasn't changed a bit, and that's exactly the way it should be; each of the four films is a masterpiece of escapist entertainment. We have a hero to root for, even if he's afraid of snakes (and just watch what happens when he has to climb out of a sinking sand trap). We have villains to jeer, and just as the Nazis of the first and third films were goofy caricatures, so too are the Soviets in this film. \\"Crystal Skull\\" goes one step further by paying homage to the previous films, specifically by mentioning the passing of both Henry Jones, Sr. (Sean Connery) and Marcus Brody (the late Denholm Elliot). We also get to see man-eating ants, and what \\"Indiana Jones\\" film would be complete without a swarm of creepy crawlies? There's no question that \\"Raiders\\" is the best of the series, but there's also no denying that \\"Crystal Skull\\" is a fun, worthy addition. I expected nothing less.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|It's a great cd, with excelent sound and great images. The best rock and roll band.
B0015GDVTU|4.0|This was a simple love story, nothing necessarily unique here, but I loved it.    I would have liked to see more of Butler's and Swank's relationship, but the flashbacks were great.  There were a few scenes that were hilarious, and the script was nicely written.  The 'funny stuff' flowed well into the more touching scenes, and none of the actors 'tried too hard.'  I am a fan of James Marsters, and it was great to see him in a more adult role.  Gina Gershon was toned down from her usual sex pot roles, and I loved her in this movie.  Lisa Kudrow was a hoot, and Kathy Bates had the right amount of concern for her hurting daughter.  I was pleasantly surprised that Swank carried off the comedy as well as she did, and her Karaoke scene was hilarious!  But I admit it, I watched for Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who was not in it as much as I would have liked.    And let's not forget Harry Connick Jr.  He stole every scene he was in.    Great movie.
B0010YSD7M|2.0|I was disappointed! I bought this movie and expected an epic conclusion to the Ori Storyline. However I was subjected to yet another replicator episode. It was not what we the fans were promised to get from this movie. I however have high hopes for Stargate Continuum.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm in pretty good shape - I run Marathons.  However, these 20 minute workouts KICKED MY BUTT!!!  They are awesome!  The only thing I would improve about this video is to have more workouts on it.  I would have paid more to have more of a variety to choose from.  Three workouts is good, but will get boring quickly.  It would have been cool to have 3 different workouts at each of the 3 levels.  Other than that, this DVD is GREAT.
B0017VG69U|5.0|This is Star Trek at its finest. The new effects are a great addition to the original show. I believe Gene Roddenberry would be proud of this. I am relieved that I don't have to buy a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD Player to play these DVDs. I preferr Standard Definition over High Definition. Keep up the great work CSB/Paramount. I hope TNG, DS9 and VOY will receive also updates.
B00005JPNZ|3.0|Ok first off, this is probably the 3rd best of the Indy movies. 1) Raider, 2)Last Crusade 3) Crystal Skull 4) Doom (which was terrible by the way).  It was fun to see Indy back on screen, the actually did a good job of showing Indy more as the teacher rather than the action hero and that's funny to say considering the movie is action packed, but it's true.  Is the movie a little bit cartoony? a little less serious?  Totally.  It failed to strike a balance between character and humor like they did in Last Crusade, but it was still a solid if unspectacular movie.  The plot was one dimensional and really kind of silly, but then again if you really look at all the Indy movies they really don't make much sense if you think about it.  The actors do a good job, Harrison Ford does a good job striking the pose as the aging archaeologist who can't do everything he thinks he can.  It was good to see Karen Allen back and to get a little back story about the times that she & Indy were together.  Shia LaBeouf is fine as Mutt (someone called him foul-mouthed, which I didn't really think was accurate or true).  Cate Blanchett does have a funny accent but it works.  I did find the ending a bit unsatisfying however.  Overall I enjoyed the movie, it's not great, but it is fun, so go for nostalgic ride and enjoy.
B00140PK6O|4.0|This movie is beautifully filmed, extremely well acted (it's fun to see some favorite English actors in very minor roles) and nicely entertaining.  It's one that you'll want to pull out every so often and watch again.
1573921394|1.0|John Maynard Keynes is the collectivist's savior.  Finally, the welfare statist thinks, someone who actually makes my ideas sound good to economists.  Unfortunately, Keynes's theory is nothing new.  It should be incredibly obvious to any non-professional that if a large entity (government) decides to spend a lot of money over a short period of time, then in the short term there will be very pleasurable effects.  In the long term, however, a large sum of money spent by the government will have very harmful effects, distorting the price system and creating inflation, whereas a large sum of money spent by a private entity will have a sustained benefit on the economy.
B00007BK2N|4.0|Just great, and a lot of fun. This is a thoroughly British film about the 1980's Manchester scene that captures the energy of the Hacienda club days.  The movie doesn't beg American audiences to know a lot about the music, though it helps to know a few hits by Joy Division and Happy Mondays. Steve Coogan as Tony Wilson is a bit of perfect casting. The band portrayals -- Sean Harris as Ian Curtis, especially -- are very good, and the cameos are fun to spot (Howard Devoto is a standout). The movie is intelligent, funny and sarcastic; lots of music, lots of dialogue go by without apology or explanation, and the film comes off as a documentary although it's a carefully-staged fictional retelling of musical history. Fans of early British rave culture will enjoy it; casual American viewers may be confused at first, but the energy and humor eventually comes through.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|After almost twenty years of waiting, Indiana Jones is back and once more on the trail of an elusive artifact.  Harrison Ford reprises the character in the fourth movie, INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL.<br /><br />The time frame has been moved to 1957 and the movie opens up with Elvis Presley blasting \\"You ain't nothin' but a hound dog.\\"  Ironically, the song was written with a female singer in mind who would be singing about her boyfriend.  The singer didn't quite fit the song, but it still made a big hit.<br /><br />That's kind of what's happening with Indiana Jones this time.  I think Indiana has a hard time fitting into the 1950s.  I much preferred him in the 1930s and 1940s.  The world was still so big and so raw during that time.  By the Cold War, we'd become aware of how small the world was getting, and how everything seemed to be about the coming days instead of the past ones.<br /><br />The pulp magazines and serial movies that Indiana Jones had more or less sprung from were dead by this time.  It was the end of a fantastic era for heroes.<br /><br />So, in a way, maybe it's fitting that the last Harrison Ford/Indiana Jones movie would be set in this time frame.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is simply an amazing actor.  After twenty years, he swaggers back into the role and leaps into the saddle.  My God, but it was fun watching him square off against the villains, against overwhelming odds, and figure out clues to archeological mysteries.  No one could have ever done this role as well, nor will they ever do it again.  Harrison Ford is the epitome of a down-to-earth hero rising to meet outlandish circumstance.  His facial expressions alone are with the price of the ticket.<br /><br />In previous movies, Ford did most of his own stunts.  This time around, he didn't have that luxury.  But I was surprised at how lithe and spry he was as he performed the ones that didn't risk significant injury.  He leapt and climbed and ran with grim authority, if not with the alacrity of his younger years.  The man is in fantastic shape.  Again, the sheer beauty of the Indiana Jones character is that, like Batman, fans can aspire to do what he does.  Even when he's a senior citizen.<br /><br />Ford still delivers the stalwart hero, the wisecracks, and the tough guy patter.  When asked for final words while facing dozens of guns and certain death, Indiana says, \\"I like Ike.\\"  Of course, I had to explain that Ike was President Eisenhower to my ten year old, but the sentiment fit the time period.  The whip action, though not as much of it as I wanted, was in place.  During one cool sequence, we see that Indy knows he's not quite the man he used to be when he swings after a fleeing truck and ends up short of the leap.<br /><br />One of the best bits about the movie was the nostalgia of seeing Indy toss bad guys from the vehicles he commandeers during the action sequences.  The action is still over the top, and I'm still a sucker for it.<br /><br />Shia LeBeouf stars at Mutt Williams and does an outstanding job of following in Indy's shadow while at time stepping out and seizing a scene.  I've constantly admired LeBeouf's acting, and he gets better every year.  (Now that trailers for EAGLE EYE, his new film, are breaking, I'm even more interested to see what he can do in a serious thriller.)  LeBeouf carries the role well, first as a greaser then as Indy's progeny because they exhibit a lot of the same traits.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett is terrific as the Russian villainess.  She seems spooky and ethereal from the moment she steps into the scene, and she's a definite challenge for Indy and company.  I liked the look she had.  The hair bob was a really nice touch, and the choice of a rapier as a personal weapon was great.  She has outstanding stage presence in the movie and looks as relentless as a Terminator in her pursuit of Indiana and the ultimate goal.<br /><br />The film plays fairly with the 1950s as well.  There's an atomic explosion, paranoia about Communism, and the rivalry between Joe College and the greasers, which I feel certain George Lucas wanted in for nostalgia of his own.  But once America is left behind, the timelessness of foreign countries sets in.<br /><br />The settings looked authentic.  The sequence where Indy and Mutt find the final resting place of the \\"lost\\" Spanish explorers is well-done.  Those scenes are eerie and scary at the same time, and the action is breath-taking.  The river sequences were well done, even if though expected.<br /><br />The special effects guys must have had a blast.  Not only on the settings, but on the action as well.  The army ants looked and sounded chilling as they took their victims, and the camera work that incorporated all of those elements was superb.<br /><br />I was particularly enthralled by the \\"solution\\" of the puzzle at the hidden city at the end.  I thought it was ingenious, but I wish I'd been given a little more time to study the puzzle, been offered more clues, and gotten to think onscreen with Indy.  However, not even he solved this one, though I don't doubt for a moment that he would have.  I just wish I'd had a better chance at it.<br /><br />A lot of people might not be happy with the film.  I had some problems with it.  Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) was given really short shrift in the movie.  She doesn't come on stage till really late, and by then the plot and story are moving so fast that she's almost eclipsed except for some important reveals.  We get no sense of how she's spent the last twenty years.  She was stunning in INDIANA JONES AND THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and I'd always wondered what it would have been like if she and Indy had hooked up for more adventures.<br /><br />Another problem for some, me included, involves a spoiler (so here's your warning) that seems to already be out there on the internet.  Even before the film wrapped, there were several rumors that the fourth Indiana Jones film would involve out-of-this-world archeology.  In short:  aliens.<br /><br />We got that message loud and clear when the movie beginning more or less starts in Area 51.  In minutes, we learn that Indy assisted in the recovery of the alien bodies from the wreck back in 1947.<br /><br />I personally don't think aliens and Indy belong in the same movie.  However, given Lucas and Spielberg's affinity for aliens (STAR WARS and E. T.), I can't blame them for wanting to lead Indy that way to tie him into the other worlds they've created.  But they lost me a little.  I was suddenly reminded I was watching a movie, a cool movie, but a movie nonetheless.  I ended up being outside of the film in a way that jarred me, and the final scene with the flying saucer taking off was almost anti-climatic at that point.<br /><br />That being said, Spielberg once again proves himself to be the master of the action movie.  The two-hour long film sprints unflinchingly across the screen.  There's hardly time to draw your breath before Indy is thrown pell-mell into some new danger.  The motorcycle chase was great, the fight scenes were enthralling, and the scene in the library when a student asks Indy an archeological question after he and Mutt slide across the floor is priceless.<br /><br />I loved the way Spielberg brought the scenes to the screen.  Everything plays big, but we're never far from the characters.<br /><br />However, the lack of the whip in the last big fight scene is noticeable.  And Mutt's sudden shift to Tarzan of the Apes comes out of the blue.  I don't know why that was there, unless it was homage to the Johnny Weissmuller films of that hero.<br /><br />There is one inconsistency that bothered me.  In the beginning of the film, Indy is introduced to Cate Blanchett's character, and even calls her by name, but later he says he doesn't know who she is and gives a description of her.<br /><br />But this was Indy 4, and we've been waiting almost twenty years for it.  Most of the older fans, like me, have had plenty of time to concoct the perfect vehicle for Indy 4, with Nazi villains, obscure corners of the earth (I was wanting Angkor Wat and headhunters), and plenty of danger.  This film might not have lived up to some fans' expectations, or gone astray from where fans feel it should have gone, but it was Indy in the way that only Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas could have brought him to us.<br /><br />Later in the film, Indy's hat blows off a rack.  We see Mutt pick it up and get seriously tempted to put it on.  However, Indy snatches the hat from him and puts it on his own head.  That's an image and a message that I'll keep forever.  I don't know if anyone will ever try to make another Indy movie, but there'll never be anyone else able to wear that hat like Harrison Ford.

B000I8G5B2|5.0|IIn some dystopian future, date unspecified, our descendants are on the cusp of a brave new world in which designer babies become the norm. Shortly before this technological achievement our hero comes upon the scene with all of the normal faults and frailties that mortal flesh is usually heir to. Having forked out for the specs necessary to redress the faults in his vision his parents decide to spend their cash second time around ensuring his brother has no need of such artificial aids. In due course the younger son surpasses his brother in the usual childhood games and is well on the way to fulfilling all of his parents aspirations and repaying their investment when Vincent, the elder and imperfect son, decides that his home life isn't doing his self esteem any favours and leaves to find his imperfect way in the perfect world bequeathed to his favoured sibling. He obtains a job as a cleaner at Gattaca, an institution whose existence depends upon selecting and training only the most ideal human specimens to continue humanity's quest for the stars. Demonstrating that crime is always a corollary of social injustice the movie has Vincent obviously managing to save enough from his cleaner's wage to take advantage of the black market in false identities and we meet Jude Law, the antithesis of Vincent in many ways: the golden boy made bad. They `swap' identities and Vincent becomes the `perfect' Jerome and begins to take pleasure in all the fruits that perfect specimens, or `valids' enjoy as part of their birthright, including those provided by off-screen wife, Uma Thurman in the person of the perfectly lovely Irene. He gets accepted for flight crew training at Gattaca and loses no opportunity to gaze at the stars his soon to be destination if all goes well!<br /><br />Vincent encounters his brother again, in the form of the senior investigating officer, when a member of Gattaca's senior people gets his perfect cranium clobbered and all of its `employees' become subject to interrogation thereby threatening Vincent's dream.<br /><br />This is an unusually thoughtful Sci-Fi film which asks all of the usual, who are we, where are we going type questions about human existence and forces an examination of the current preoccupation with genetic engineering, celebrity, `extreme makeover' shows and the type of air-headed celeb mags such as Hello that push the air-brushed perfection to which we are all supposed to aspire.

B0015HQ326|4.0|Considering the negative response this film has generated, I went into the movie theater not expecting much.  The premise of the movie sounded interesting so I figured--why not give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  I actually liked it.  To tell you the truth, I liked it a lot more than 2046.  I will admit Norah Jones was not very good.  I liked the cinematography and score.  I thought David Strathairn and Natalie Portman were exceptionally good.  The story reminded me of something Wim Wenders would've written: you never know what you have until you lose it.  Very existentialist.  Go see WINGS OF DESIRE to know what I'm talking about.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This is my favorite movie. I've watched it nearly ten times in the few weeks I've owned it. I have read and appreciated all of Jane Austen's work.<br />Many critics site the movie's artistic liscense where it deviates from the book in particular ways. I watched an interview with the director who answered critics and literary fans of Jane Austen's cry \\"Where is the rest of the book?\\" with this \\"It's in the book.\\" This film adaptation does move very quickly and has been pared down to the quintesential love story between Anne and Wentworth. For the runtime deemed suitable, characters are developed as much as possible, but being an Austen work, there are a lot of characters and withouth it being several hours long a great deal of character development is done by having to pay close attention to the conversations between characters in each scene.<br /><br />This film has afforded me the opportunity to introduce Jane Austen and this particular work, often overshadowed by her others, Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility with my friends and husband, who would never think to crack open her books. For that I am profoundly grateful. This adaptation of Persuasion lies in the middle of two territories. The first being completely acurate and true to the novel and  filmed with all the conventions of Austen's time and customs honored making for a sometimes pushing the viewer to a purely auditory enjoyment and the other end of the spectrum where it has been too modernized, characters doing things unheard of the time, big grandeous high budget filming, etc.<br /><br />Where in the middle it falls should be up to the viewer to decide, but it is definently worth viewing. DIe hard Austen fans should not let the deviations destroy the appreciation that Austen's work has again found a new voice in a new decade and those new to Austen or Persuasion who will no doubt enjoy the love story, scenery, and interplay between the characters just might find themselves wanting to pick up the book, and find out what all the movie left out.t what all the movie left out.
B00005JPNZ|5.0|1957 - jeeps are driving up to a military base.  There's a sign warning of a bomb test shortly.  A Colonel requests entrance on the base and is denied.  His men open fire on the sentries and storm the base.      Their goal--the soon to be detonated bomb? Nope, the dusty storage facility.    The men, who turn out to be Russians, open the trunk and drag out a hostage.  Guess who?  If you guessed Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) you are correct.     That's the opening to this film...    It's twenty years after we left Indy.  He's a little bit greyer, but he's still going strong.  This time, he's teamed up with Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), a motorcycle riding, leather wearing college dropout who needs his help saving his father Oxley (John Hurt) and Mom, Mary (Karen Allen) from the Russians who are holding them captive.     What the Russians want is a Nascan Indian relic, a crystal skull of legend that some say was the manifestation of a god. If they don't get it, Mutt's parents die.      There's a lot to like about this film:    There may be some wear and tear on Ford, but he can still pull off playing Indy.     Karen Allen is back reprising her role as Marion Ravenwood. She's always been the best of the female leads in this series and she still can deliver 26 years after \\"Raiders.\\"     Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) a Russian research into psychic phenomenon and the supernatural is the lead villain and she plays her part superbly. My favorite part of this film is the typical car chase with an Indy twist that every action and adventure fan should love.     Plus, I think the themes in this story tie together a lot of elements that people who love the Indy series are going to appreciate.  I will definitely be buying the DVD when it becomes available.

B00005JPNZ|4.0|A few years have passed since we last saw him. He's a bit gray around the muzzle, and the bad guys aren't the WWII foes any more, but the Cold War Soviets. It's not clear that all the Americans are good guys either, with the commie witch-hunt in full swing and government investigations looking ever more like mafia shakedowns and intimidation. (Any commentary on current events is wholly in the mind of the reader.)<br /><br />We got past Indy's \\"cute\\" phase. There's a kid again, but this one's a 1950s greaser with a shiv, who'll stand against anything as long as his hair looks cool. As with Sean Connery, he's more a colleague in this adventure than sidekick. And there's the babe too. This time it's Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen - again. Indy's aged since the first movie in this franchise and so has Marion. She's a strong and handsome figure again, in more than one sense. Seeing the two actors genuinely age, as well as skipping forward in story time, adds a charm to the pair that really can't be synthesized. The reunion makes for some nice points in the plot, which I leave you to see for yourself. Oh, and Indy's hat gets a few really good scenes.<br /><br />Summer movies like this tend to be commodity entertainment, but this is a very fine commodity. The heroes stand tall, bad guys (including Cate Blanchett as the baddest of the bad) fit all the stereotypes they need to, chase scenes thrill and amuse, and the effects become increasingly grand as the story reaches its crescendo. There's lots of ineffectual gunplay and some really bad science, but the violence takes on a comic edge just before it would have turned realistically bloody. The plot wears thin enough that I had trouble avoiding spoilers, but hey - that's not why you're watching this movie. You signed up for a roller coaster ride, and you get one.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
0977326403|5.0|Jim Collins is the author of \\"Good to Great,\\" an influential business and leadership book.  In the time since the publication of the book, Collins realized that there exist points of disconnect within the book for leaders of not-for-profit agencies (e.g. churches, local charitable organizations, groups that exist for specific causes like disease eradication or the advancement of art).  In an effort to apply the concepts of \\"Good to Great\\" to the unique needs of social service organizations, this monograph was produced.<br /><br />This monograph can best be thought of as an appendix or additional chapter for \\"Good to Great.\\"  Indeed, the reader will be lost unless first reading the work upon which this monograph is based.  In it, five points/modifications/explanations are provided that address what Collins perceives to be the five biggest \\"trouble areas\\" when applying \\"Good to Great\\" to not-for-profit agencies.<br /><br />First, not-for-profits struggle with the definition of \\"great.\\"  In the definition supplied by Collins in \\"Good to Great,\\" \\"great\\" is partly defined in terms of profit margin.  Since not-for-profit agencies, by definition, do not seek profits, a modification must be made.  Collins suggests using anecdotal evidence and rubrics instead of budgetary numbers to determine if the organization's goals are being met.<br /><br />Second, power and authority in social sector organizations are not centralized, but contain nearly limitless checks (\\"a thousand points of no\\").  Collins advocates a leadership style that emphasizes the good of the organizations.  If the organizational leader can effectively communicate (legitimately, not falsely) that his main concern is the health of the organization and realization of the cause, he buys himself a lot of leeway in decision making.<br /><br />Third, volunteer-based organizations feel great pressure to simply put warm bodies in positions of authority instead of selectively choosing only the best candidates.  Collins argues that the pressures of a volunteer-based culture should only make the leader more determined to practice selectivity.  Setting high standards, focusing on creating \\"pockets of excellence\\" within organizations, and emphasizing the moral importance of the organization can help to attract high-quality employees and volunteers.<br /><br />Fourth, the concept of profit margin creeps in again.  It is important to recognize that organizations--business as well as social-sector--need money to operate.  Even though not-for-profit agencies are not about the money, their \\"hedgehog concept\\" should certainly include consideration of their economic engine.  That is, their social cause should take into consideration the question, \\"will people actually buy into our cause and support it with donations of volunteer hours, monetary donations, and in-kind support?\\"<br /><br />Finally, the organization must not neglect promoting itself as a \\"brand.\\"  Although the natural inclination of social sector institutions is to keep the focus on the cause, they must also make sure people understand that the organization is meeting the cause effectively...indeed, they are \\"the best\\" at what they do.  A reputation for excellence tends to attract loyalty and donations.  Consider Harvard University, which attracts millions of dollars it doesn't necessarily need because people believe that a Harvard education is \\"the best\\" in the world.<br /><br />In all, as a pastor in a not-for-profit church, this book addressed all the concerns I had in applying Collins' \\"Good to Great\\" concepts in my situation.  Truth be told, it even addressed problems I had not yet identified.  I highly recommend this brief monograph to compliment \\"Good to Great.\\"olunteer-based culture should only make the leader more determined to practice selectivity.

B00007GZR5|4.0|Robin Williams in a serious role? Could work.  Robin Williams with an emotionally unstable wife? Ironic.  Robin Williams dies and goes through heaven and hell? Cinematic gold.    Robin Williams plays Chris Nielsen, a doctor devoted to his artist wife, Annie, played by Annabella Sciorra. They're a loving couple that have experienced the heartbreak of losing their children in a car wreck. But when Chris is killed in a car crash as well, he must learn to move on and accept his death. He watches over his widow for the first few days after having died. But then he is transported into a \\"heaven\\" which he manifests, a beautiful world of paint inspired by his wife's art. His former mentor played by Cuba Gooding, Jr., who is also dead but not what he appears to be, guides him as he creates his own reality. But when Annie commits suicide Chris must journey into a dark netherworld to save her. There she has created her own afterlife, a \\"hell\\" to match her despair and pain. Chris enlists the aid of a tracker, played by Max von Sydow who is also dead and yet again not what he appears to be, who will help him find Annie. Along the way Chris is reunited with his children and learns that only through faith and vulnerability can one become strong enough to heal.    The film is directed by Vincent Ward and is a startling example of spiritual and psychological storytelling, even if the screenplay is convoluted at times. The film is based upon [[ASIN:0765361183 the book by Richard Matheson]]. Visually the film is absolutely breathtaking and gives us for the first time in centuries, a truly original idea of what life after death may look like. What hurts the film is the awkward way the story unfolds through flashbacks. Some films can handle a non-linear story but the editor fails to set up a proper chronology before assembling this epic picture. However viewers should not be deterred by this minor annoyance. It's still worth seeing... again and again.    The affordably priced DVD includes the following special features: audio commentary with Vincent Ward, alternate ending, two featurettes, photo gallery, cast & filmmakers' bios and filmographies, and dual interactive menus (one for Heaven and one for Hell).

0740748475|5.0|I just got back from my post office here in Oslo Norway. The little woman who went back to get this package for me looked less than thrilled. This is HEAVY!<br /><br />Well, anyhow, I just had my first look at this and it's stunning. Calvin and Hobbes deserve no less.<br /><br />1987. It's been that many years since I was in Denmark on holiday and bought my first volume of Calvin and Hobbes? (Steen & Stoffer in Danish, Tommy & Tigern in Norwegian). Wow, how time flies.<br /><br />Calvin and Hobbes have been a great influence on me. I have tried and failed over the years to be a cartoonist or graphic artist myself, but my failure aside, this series really pushed me in conveying ideas with simple yet effective drawings. And that's the crux of this whole success. Amazing yet simple art, effective storytelling, heart, cheekyness, flights of fantasy and even a bit of insanity.<br /><br />Calvin and Hobbes is all about lost youth to me, and I always pictured the last Calvin and Hobbes showing Calvin walking past Hobbes, with Hobbes no longer a living tiger, but being just a stuffed toy. Calvin realising that this time of his life is over, bursting into tears, and running to his mother for comfort.<br /><br />Instead he left us, looking for adventure in the woods behind his house with his best friend, destined to live forever in an endless summer.<br /><br />When a cartoon gets to you on so many levels, does it seize being a cartoon? I'm not sure you can even use the word about something as monumental as this, but don't let that put you off. This is great literature, and you should own it simply to show people that you are a kid at heart, and that you know a great body of work when you see it.
B00005JPNZ|1.0|WARNING: This review contains spoilers!    After 19 years, Indiana Jones returns to the silver screen in what may be Steven Spielberg's worst film ever (or until now, anyway). Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a bust. The screenplay was amateurishly written and the film itself is directed with juvenile enthusiasm. The overall mood of the picture doesn't even feel like that of Indiana Jones, but rather more like [[ASIN:B000W1SZAO National Treasure]], [[ASIN:B0018CWESA The Mummy Returns]] or [[ASIN:B00003CXZ1 Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]. This is not the Indiana Jones that I grew up with, certainly not the anti-establishment, cynical yet humorous hero who went on adventures with a devil-may-care attitude.  Now there are a few positive things to say about this film (not many). Mainly Harrison Ford still has \\"it\\". He's fantastic as Indiana Jones as he always has been and probably always will be. Unfortunately the way his character is written seems to contradict his persona of the original three films. In one scene when confronted with a group of cliché Communist villains intent upon his destruction, they ask him if he has any last words... he responds, \\"I like Ike.\\" What the fedora?  As for the Communists in the film, they are in no way an accurate portrayal of Socialism. They are nothing more than fill-ins for the Nazis of Raiders and Last Crusade. There is no historical value in their portrayal here, none. I had no idea that the filmmakers were going to turn Indiana Jones into a conservative, narrow-minded hypocrite. I'm not coming to the defense of the Soviets in their actions but to the defense of the history of politics.  And as for the idea that Communists have always been fascinated with the occult and psychic abilities, this is only partially true. In the 1940s and `50s, some dictatorial figures in the Soviet Union were interested in ideas such as mind control. But this is a very small group of fanatics, most of which never came into power. However the idea that the Communists held the same plebian concepts about the occult that Hitler did, is an insult. (One of the main ideas behind Communism was that religion on a whole operated on two simple and destructive emotive factors: fear and the need to invert it into faith, and hate with its initial birth from ignorance and beliefs concerning superiority and inferiority. For further studies of this subject, try reading the book [[ASIN:1591023068 And God Created Lenin: Marxism vs Religion in Russia 1917-1929]], which examines the conflict between Communism and Christianity.)    Indy searches for a fabled crystal skull that may hold great power, which is why the Soviets are after it. Other plot elements include the discovery of an ancient Aztec civilization, Indiana Jones reunites with Marion, Mutt Williams becomes Indy's young sidekick and a traitorous spy weaves in and out of the story. Not to mention the aliens. Correction: \\"Inner-dimensional Beings\\".    The entire plot feels something akin to an [[ASIN:B0002W4TNA Ed Wood]] film. Now I'm not one to compare films (I find it to be elitist and narrow-minded) but since Spielberg and Lucas seem to feel that recycling all their old films into new ones is acceptable, I don't feel that I will have lowered myself at all. This could be viewed as the Indiana Jones equivalent to [[ASIN:B00006HBUJ Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones]]. In fact Indy even uses the classic Star Wars line, \\"I've got a bad feeling about this.\\" And that's not the only reference to other Spielberg and Lucas films. The \\"beings\\" look just like those in [[ASIN:B000VECAD0 Close Encounters]].  There's even a scene in which Indy climbs into a refrigerator to escape a nuclear blast while on a test site in the Nevada desert. This entire scene is simply an in-joke that refers to an old version of the screenplay for [[ASIN:B00006AL1E Back to the Future]]. In that early draft Doc's time machine was a refrigerator and Marty was only able to escapethe `50s by going to a nuclear test site in the Nevada desert. Notice the mindless repetition. There are of course other in-jokes that revolve around the Indiana Jones films as well. Hey, did you just see the Lost Ark? Uh, huh.  When will directors learn that sequels are often unnecessary? We didn't need three sequels to Jaws, the prequels to Star Wars, the sequels to [[ASIN:B000BCE918 Jurassic Park]] or this pathetically inadequate sequel to Indiana Jones. Why do they feel the need to re-release their classic films with new special effects and new footage? Why do we suffer through summers of endless sequels, prequels, remakes and spin-offs? I'll tell you why. Most of the directors have lost not only their originality but also their artistic integrity. They're greedy, capitalist schmucks. They don't care about the fans of their films or of their characters. They only care about merchandising, exploiting their fame, and making as much money off their once brilliant ideas as possible. It's sad really.  I'm not one to dictate to others but if you're a fan of Indiana Jones, I'd suggest you skip this and go watch the [[ASIN:B00003CXC5 DVDs of the originals]]. In fact you'd probably be best if you didn't even acknowledge this fiasco of a film. I know that ignoring the new Star Wars and Indiana Jones films may seem juvenile and melodramatic to some, but not as juvenile and melodramatic as the films themselves are. In conclusion the Indiana Jones legacy is history. Its remnants shall be lost along with those of other franchises driven into the dirt by greedy filmmakers.  The only way to bring Indy back would be to have him go back in time and erase this part of his story arc. Yes, that's it! He should meet up with Doc Brown and build a time machine and go back in time. And perhaps he'll go back too far and end up in the Cretaceous Period where he'll be forced to fight off the Jurassic Park dinosaurs only to be saved by E.T. and Chewbacca. Really, this would be great. In fact I think someone should pitch this idea to Spielberg. *    * = ironic statement

B000VWYNNW|5.0|Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones and John Bonham are at their peak on the performances recorded here.  Led Zep is one of those rare groups that is as excellent in the studio as they are live.  This and 'How The West Was Won' give the listener a real sense of what they were about as a live group, but this two CD set is perfection beyond their greatness.  They were and still remain the greatest rock group ever.
B000UD0ESA|2.0|This (\\"final cut\\" version) is just not the film I remember and enjoyed. What is most bothersome to me is the missing voice over. That added the human element to what otherwise ends up being a bland, dark film. Very disapointing.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|\\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is a fun movie with some great actors, good action and great b-film script. And like his other movies this Indiana Jones adventure springs from a genuine archeological mystery. We should have expected this topic since the crystal skull is back in vogue again as we approach 2012, the year the thirteen crystal skulls need to be rejoined according to Mayan legend. One of the problems is the movie takes place in 1957. And the skulls do not match the shape of those that have been found since the 1860's.     Crystal skulls really exist and look like human, unlike in the movie. No one knows much about the real skulls. They have no tool marks as is described in the movie, but they do exist. As does the Mitchell-Hedges skull that is mentioned in the movie, which has unsubstantiated Mayan origins and supposed mystical powers.    Now back to 1957 and the movie. Since the Nazi's have been defeated Indiana Jones new nemesis is the Russians and the McCarthy induced paranoid F.B.I. Which makes sense for that time in U.S. history. Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones well, he is still has his great one-liners while performing death defying acts and still using his skills to deftly solve all the puzzles. Instead of Indy's specialty of the spiritual or mystical mystery, we are taken into the realm of Sci-Fi.    Cate Blanchett plays our villain, Stalin's favorite psychic scientist, Irina Spalko. Her acting is good, but as a villain she is not too diabolical. I hate to say it, but at times she seems almost comical, yet professional enough to stay in character. We start off with her forcing Indy to find an item in a government warehouse that is obviously White Sands New Mexico, which is near Roswell. And because of his actions, Indy is set off on an adventure that is not of his choosing. As he escapes a situation, which would not be possible, even for Indy to escape. Which leads us to what the film is lacking, that feel that Indy is never in any real danger.    Mutt Williams played by Shia LeBeouf is the key that starts him on his quest to save a friend and find the crystal skull. It is as if Mutt is being groomed to carry on the series as he becomes Indy's sidekick. He is ok for a few moments at a time, but I am not sure if he could pick up for Harrison Ford. Perhaps Indy will give us one more adventure before he retires.    Then Indy's love interest from \\"Raiders,\\" Marion, once again played by Karen Allen, is back and is the real star of this movie. Like some of the other reviewers I do not wish to ruin the surprise on how she fits into the plot of the movie. But I was sure pleased to see her as she steps back into her role as Marion. And She still has the on screen chemistry with Indy with the fiery personality that we remember.     This fourth installment of Indiana Jones is a little contrived, the plot is not the greatest, but if you just go along for the fast packed action ride with great visual effects you should enjoy it. Three-and-half stars, but since Karen Allen played her part so well I'll rate it four and watch it again when its on DVD.
B00080Z53O|5.0|This is a true story of a 55 year old Spanish man who is a bedridden quadriplegic.  Ramon Sampedro, the former ship mechanic, was paralyzed from the neck down after a swimming mishap.  After being bedridden for more than 30 years, he is determined to end his life and \\"die with dignity.\\"  His brother, sister-in-law, nephew and father care for him.  Ramon struggles in being a burden and being helpless while his family copes with the daily grind of caring for him and dealing with his death wish.      Ramon develops relationships with two women who fall in love with him - one has a terminal illness and the other is a factory worker.  Both play key supporting roles in developing Ramon's character and the story line.  Javier Bardem, who plays Ramon, is witty, intelligent, charming, sympathetic and an unforgettable figure - and perhaps here lies the irony for this character who is looking to end his life.    Euthanasia is a tough topic no matter which  side you are on.  Yet, the story is both moving and balanced - the acting (esp. Javier Bardem playing Ramon) deserved the numerous awards and widespread recognition  - and the cinematography (countryside, the sea, the rustic farmhouse) was spectacular.  It's hard to imagine that there is a \\"feel good\\" movie about euthanasia, terminal illnesses and the severely handicapped - however this certainly makes the grade.  I found this to be one of the best movies that I have ever seen.
B00190OHD6|5.0|I was hesitant at first to rent this movie because I thought it would be more depressing than anything else, but I was sadly mistaken!!    I laughed and cried throughout the whole movie, I spent the entire two hours completely taken in by the storyline and characters.    I think I have a new dvd in my favorites list now!!
B000YABYLA|1.0|Right from the opening I knew what this movie was going to be: unbearable. I had heard wonderful things about it, as to how \\"witty and adorable\\" it was. Quite frankly, I saw no character, no wit, and definitely nothing adorable about this movie. Never have I seen a girl react so nonchalantly about a pregnancy, nor have I heard someone's parents state \\"i'd rather have her on hard drugs.\\" This movie focuses how idiotic the current teenage population is, how abortion clinics are terrible places, and how life \\"is always out to get me\\". I see that as a disgrace to people nationwide. I think there's more character in Garden State than this movie here.     In addition, I found the acting horrid. Maybe it was just the sucky dialogue and terrible storyline that made this movie swirl into oblivion, but the acting on its own, was also horrendous. Ellen Page was the least bit witty and funny. If I knew a \\"Juno\\" in real life, I would have probably gone insane. Oh, and Michael Cerra did a terrible job too. He had absolutely no character. I would think that a block of wood was more interesting than him.     So now let me get attacked by all these hipsters who thought this movie was \\"utterly fabulous\\" just because everyone else thinks so.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|This album is incredible.  Don't listen to the people who whine about how it's not like their 80's material.  \\"These Colours Don't Run\\", \\"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\\" and \\"Lord of Light\\" are powerful tracks that only a band like Maiden could pull off.  I rank this album in the top 5 Maiden albums.  Get it!
B000000WFF|5.0|As a younger child, I grew up listening to the Spice Girls. Spice came out when I was 7, and SpiceWorld when I was 8. Although Spice is amazing and definitely has some great hits, I must say SpiceWorld is my favorite Spice Girls album. It starts out with their huge hit, Spice Up Your Life, one of my favorites and a very popular choice among fans. Next is Stop, an upbeat song that makes you want to dance (they even made up a cute and easy dance to go along with it!) Too Much is the theme song to their movie of the same name, which is a slower ballad. Not a bad song, but not one of my favorite songs by them. Saturday Night Divas is a great song with a slower, sexy melody. One of the best songs on the album in my opinion. Never Give Up On The Good Times is guaranteed to put anybody in a good mood, with its catchy chorus and upbeat tempo. Move Over is one of the songs used for their Pepsi commercials, shorter but very good. Do It is another one of my favorite songs ever. Its positive lyrics and fun melody never fail to make me want to get up and sing. Denying is a great song, very typical Spice Girls, with each member having a part and Mel B having her little rap-type section. Viva Forever is a really great song with great lyrics as well. The Lady is a Vamp is a classic song that mentions many famous people, including Elvis, Norma Jean, and Bob Marley. I can honestly say there isn't a song on SpiceWorld that I dislike. 5/5/, an A+ album in my opinion :)
B0000TB050|5.0|I first listened/saw this DVD about 3 years ago.  In those 3 years, it is probably the most oft-watched DVD in my collection music or otherwise.  I can't explain in words why it's so captivating to watch, only that it's an experience similar to going to a concert and witnessing something truly special.  They are on an emotional rollercoaster and you feel lucky to be able to witnes it.  One cannot help but get choked up when Bono tells a story about his father before dedicating Kite to his memory. Yes there is lots of interplay within the band.  Bono resting his head on Adam's back while he continues to sing; or 're-living' Out of Control with Bono introducing the band as if it were 30 years prior.  Or maybe it's the interaction with the crowd:  Bono sings 'Beautiful Goal' rather than Beautiful Girl at the end of Beautiful Day to honor Ireland's world cup win witnessed by the crowd that very day!  Or maybe it's Bono calling out the names of the victims killed at Omaugh during Sunday Bloody Sunday and exclaiming 'Put your hands in the sky, put your hands in the air, if you're the prayin' kind then turn this song into a prayer' (btw this is the best version I've seen of this song...ever).  And as other viewers have mentioned earlier, Bono's father passed away in the week after filming the first show and the filming of the second show.  In u2 by u2, the band says that none of the footage from the first show was used in this dvd, it all came from the second show.  The band recognized and reacted to the energy from the crowd and it is so plainly evident.  Prior to this dvd, I can't say I was a huge u2 fan.  However, after seeing what they're capable of, I'm a believer.  Do yourself a favor.  Run, don't walk, and purchase this dvd.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
B00005JPNZ|5.0|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull delivered exactly what I hoped for and more. When any kind of artist is having a blast with a creation, it shows -- and Indy shines. It's a loving pastiche, perfect closure, and non-stop action.<br /><br />Make sure not to suck down too much soda pop because there isn't a moment for a bathroom break. The movie careens and lunges, scratches and giggles, shoots and whips. It's big and cornball and wonderful.

1402714572|4.0|Treasure Island is truly a treasure that many teenagers do not discover. Its rich language and stunning plot will captivate anyone. Teenagers should take the time and make the effort to become acquainted with this literary classic. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in pirates and this book is right up there with the best of the stories. Full of adventure, treachery, and deceit, this yarn is wonderfully spun. As you read, you go back in time to the years of the pirates. You meet evil, sinister Israel Hands, and honest, innocent Jim Hawkins. It is a fight between good and evil. While the good and the bad are fighting against each other, one man is trying to decide to be good or evil. Long John Silver, the merry, unscrupulous buccaneer cannot decide what side to be on. One day he is a greedy pirate looking for loot and the next he is helping the good guys conquer the bad. Treasure Island is like a study of good and evil with many examples of human nature and the consequences that come from the choices that are made. For anyone who is in need of a great book, Treasure Island is it. The story travels from a sleepy inn disturbed by a drunken buccaneer to the rolling sea and then on to the incredible island. Battles are fought and foes vanquished. The wide variety of characters with exotic personalities will engage a reader of any age.
B000001F6T|4.0|Ten Years After did something different and good here and it was perfectly applicable after doing hard blues for the previous four or five years.  A talented musicians' drive is always to keep searching and trying different things other than reproducing the sound of previous albums, in which Lee & Co. are no exception to the rule, where Stonehenged proved that very rule. It's a good record by itself.  As for the poor reviewers, consider whining about The Beatles or Beach Boys on why Revolver or Pet Sounds is so different than their previous material and see how that goes.
0385495323|5.0|If you want to know about codes, secrets, cryptography and cryptanalysis then this is the book. Simon Singh presents the history of codes in a clear and simple way. Without the mathematics to disturb the flow of the story, you enjoy plots, conspiracies, secrets and algorithms. Excellent for general knowledge and for an introductory text in cryptanalysis. Buy it!
0307387178|5.0|This is a remarkbly written book about a unique young man. All are probably aware of the plot - guy basically becomes a modern Henry David Thoreau. This book is about his physical and, I guess you could say, spiritual journey.    Other reviewers have judged the morality and character of Chris McCandless, but I refrain. Whatever he was, he was unique and, most importantly, real. I'm glad he wasn't idealized. Real people are always more interesting than fake, because flaws permeate our world and define reality.    Above all, this story is inspiring because it reflects the inner struggle of a wanderer who is searching and searching, though what for he is not quite sure.

B00005JPNZ|4.0|This Indy delivers, the sets are outstanding and there is a supreme sense of adventure throughout.  Having grown up on this series I took my 7 year old to this, and neither of us were disappointed. Shia L. is fun and fits right into the action as does Karen Allen and her return to the character of Marion Ravenwood.  Denholm Elliot has passed (RIP) and is replaced by another scholarly type played by Jim Broadbent. John Hurt is also fun in his hypnotized state as he bounces through the action.  The tremendous sense of exhileration and excitement pounds through every scene, particularly Indy and Mutt's initial investigation of a tomb.  The special effects work overall is excellent and the CG is kept to a minimum allowing this Indy to feel fairly organic in its cobwebs and nooks and crannies.  Heaps more satisfying than the Last Crusade and more family friendly than TEMPLE OF DOOM, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is second only to the original RAIDERS.  A spring time blast of adrenaline and punches to the face it might not be perfect but its the best time I have had at the theater in awhile.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|I was already a devoted Kubrick fan - after all, \\"Dr Strangelove\\", \\"2001\\" and \\"Clockwork Orange\\" all debuted within the previous 10 years (my teens). In the months preceeding the release of Barry Lyndon I read about several aspects of the filmmaking that piqued my anticipation - and ultimately contributed to my lifelong appreciation for this film: 1. The fact that Kubrick assisted in the development of lenses of heretofore unequaled sensitivity in order to film numerous interior scenes by natural or candlelight; 2. That he chose as subject matter a novel (by Thackery), that the author himself had so disliked that he discouraged its publication during his lifetime; and 3. I read that Kubrick had listened to \\"every\\" extant period composition for quartet to choose the accompanying soundtrack. Sure, I was as skeptical as anyone as to how Ryan O'neill - Mr \\"Love Story\\" - could possibly have the gravitas for a Kubrickian character, and I knew going in that it was 3+ hours long... but I was hypnotized from the opening frame. The pacing, the sardonic narration, the breathtaking cinematography, the unerring score. Certainly my affinities for photography and art history were thoroughly rewarded, but I also found the storytelling strangely compelling as well. Which is why I sat through the film twice, on the BIG screen, within the first few weeks that it opened. As an insight into my cinematic preferences, the only other film that I recall seeing twice within the first few weeks of release, was \\"Natural Born Killers\\"... The soundtrack to BL is also highly recommended.
0671015206|5.0|I'm a single woman in my early 30s, my parents are middle-class and doing okay.  The only thing i was taught as a kid was \\"save your money\\" or \\"dont spend it\\".  that went in one ear and out the other.  i never had it in my mind to rely on a man or get married for wealth, but my Mom always seemed to put that idea towards me...even though i never took it on.  Im an educated woman and working on my Business Degree.  Ive made my mistakes in Credit card debt but luckily i am almost debt free and my mistakes never got out of control... i stopped and panicked when my debt hit $8k and for me that was it!    This book is teaching me much more in terms of having a mindset of growing wealth and investing than anything or person in my life ever has.  I wish i had this book 10 years ago when i was 20 but i still have plenty of time to get this thing on track.    When we buy groceries we usually have our brands and favorites we buy on certain things... me i pay good money for ice cream.  This week I saved $3 by switching to a cheap brand.  i was proud of myself.  That $3 goes into my savings.  I have no doubt in my mind that I will never become a PAW, I plan on putting more time into investing and learning about money each week.    Too bad my Dad never taught me this stuff :(
0684830485|4.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel about love, deception, war, and trustworthiness.  Author Ernest Hemingway can be seen as the perfect writer for this book.  All novels are not created equally and this one outshines most.       This novel starts off in the midst of the Spanish Civil War in May of 1937.  Robert Jordan, the protagonist, is seen in the beginning of the story as an American scientist that wants to blow up a bridge that is being used by the Fascists.  The Fascists are people in the war fighting against the Republicans or rebels.  Jordan is blocked to this path by a man named Pablo who will not help him with his plans for blowing up the bridge.  Pablo, so called leader of the rebels, is the opposite of Jordan by seeing the whole plan as a danger zone for the safety of his men.  Pablo's wife Pilar, real leader of the rebels, seems to enjoy the plan and decides to help Jordan out with it.  Pablo has been demoted as the leader and now his men blame him for all of the calamities that happen throughout the story, such as the killing of troops just for their horses.       As the story progresses, there is the smell of love in the air when Jordan meets Maria in the rebel camp.  Maria is a woman who has been raped by the Fascists and seeks revenge upon them.  Maria and Jordan have several \\"sexual sensations\\" throughout the novel and they imagine themselves living a normal life after the war is over.  This is ironic because things do not work out the way they want to.     By the end of the story, the bridge has been blown apart by Robert and the rebel band, but some people do not make it back alive.  Robert Jordan progresses throughout the story as a stiff and unchanging character.  He develops a sense of distrust even though he supports the Republican side.  Hemingway sets the tone for an appetite of destruction and leads it off into a sense of love and sensation at the end.     This novel can be seen as a great attribute to war fiction by incorporatinglove and hate into the war zone.  Many people should decide to read this book because while reading this book it brings home war in a realistic manner.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|It seems hard to believe now both as to the performer as well as to what was being attempted that anyone would take umbrage at a performer using an electric guitar to tell a folk story (or any story for that matter). It is not necessary to go into all the details of what or what did not happen with Pete Seeger at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 to know that one should be glad, glad as hell, that Bob Dylan continued to listen to his own drummer and carry on a career based on electronic music.    Others have, endlessly, gone on about Bob Dylan's role as the voice of his generation (and mine), his lyrics and what they do or do not mean and his place in the rock or folk pantheons, or both. I just want to comment on a couple of songs here. Obviously, no one will ever really unravel what the meaning of Subterranean Homesick Blues is about except that it has produced one of the most famous lines of the 1960's- `you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows' (although if the truth be known you do) that I am fond of using anytime I get a change to use it as a political cutting edge. Love Minus Zero No Limit is one of the great modern love songs that will along with a few others define what love, longing and companionship meant for our generation ('my love is like some raven at my window with a broken wing' says more above love than half the sonnets every written).     Needless to say Gates of Eden is the modern equivalent of John Milton's Paradise Lost (and I do not mean to use that praise hyperbolically). If Milton was explaining the ways of god to man in the aftermath of the defeat of the English Revolution then Dylan was attempting to give his take on the eternal verities for modern times.

0066620996|5.0|In one of the best examples of literature on paradigm shift thinking, Jim Collins writes a book that challenges the very core of organizational thinking and how companies function. At the very heart of the book is the premise that \\"Good is the enemy of great\\". Collins then provides examples of top companies that made a concerted effort to get beyond good and become great companies that have sustained growth for decades.    In order to go from good to great, Collins outlines an approach that all organizations need to go through. One major point of emphasis is to get the right people on the bus. This clever analogy is echoed throughout the book and points to the fact that in order to move an organization forward, that organization needs to have the right employees doing the right jobs and if they aren't move them around until they are.    Another fascinating concept that Collins introduces is the Hedgehog Concept. Collins describes this process in three very important questions that all organizations need to answer. What are you deeply passionate about? What can you be the best in the world at? What drives your economic engine? Finding the answers to these questions ultimately will lead an organization to the flywheel of success or the doom loop.    Overall, Jim Collins has created a masterful design in paradigm shift thinking. In order to change an organization, a shift from the present paradigms to ones that are permeating on the edge needs to take place. In order to do this, the right people need to be on the bus and the paradigm needs to contribute to your organization being the best in the world at something. If not, an organization might continue to be good, but will never be great.
B000YKE87W|4.0|How 'young' is Mr Kaufmann? May be 38, or 39. By this age, the voice has clearly begun to settle into a more baritonal spinto tenor.<br />There is no need to downrate this wonderful singer simply because he is a spinto - opera goers all know how precious such a genre of tenor is - even if you are a diehard JDF or RV fan.<br />Kaufmann's voice is totally different from them. Given his recent rise to international fame, he will definitely be offered a diverse performing contract by opera houses. However, such versatility is not something to his credit per se: some roles in this recording, notably Alfredo, is simply not his best. Luckily he has not included Belmonte or Tamino or Octavio or Fernando in this album.  If he 'used' to excel in such roles, well, let them be counted as wonderful past performances. The caveat is to preserve the voice for the truly 'great' roles that suits him from this date onwards - the spinto roles.<br />Have you ever heard Vickers sighing away in La Traviata? Come on, leave this signature role of bushy-eyebrows to where it belongs, and deftly follow the footsteps of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau before: confine the voice to its best-suited repertoire.<br />The musical world would thank a thousand times over for it.
B000007R1E|1.0|I bought the disc advertised as DVD-Audio only to find it turned out to be DTS which is not the same thing (though the liner the DVD is held in said \\"DVD-Audio\\" with all other references on the DVD being DTS).      I had a recent standard CD of this album for comparison and can say on my Acura EL DVD-Audio car system that the DTS version is either defective or as I suspect DTS is not the same caliber audio as DVD-Audio.  One key issue was the lack of a Center speaker channel track (which is essential to DVD-Audio surround).      Overall the audio experience was no better and maybe not as good as the basic CD Stereo version I had and not even remotely in the same league as other true DVD-Audio tracks on the DVD-Audio disc that came with the Acura.  Considering the Acura DVD-Audio disk included a Jim Morrison from the early 70's (fantastic sound) I figured that the Moody Blues tracks from the same era would have a similar \\"updated\\" DVD-Audio sound quality but not even close.  Until I can figure our how to get \\"true\\" high quality DVD-Audio based on some consistent quality standard governing use of the term in advertising I do not plan to waste my money on DVD-Audio discs

I was prepping a three year old for spinal surgery, and her parents were reading it to her.  She seemed to like it and be comforted by it (though, to be fair, she WAS flying high on Versed at the time).      Me?  I was kinda squicked.  Maybe I'm too midwestern for this book, or something.  The mom?  Creeping on her belly to the teenager's bed?  Yeah.  That.    Two stars because the kid seemed to like it, and I guess that is the important thing.  They were a very nice family, not weirdos at all, and were so happy to show the book to me...is it perhaps like a cult, and they were drawing me in?

Please at least make it with spanish subtitles, it is ideal to see one show in its original language, but the spanish subtitles will make it even more whorty!<br />Thanks to all of you for this spectacular show! and for the chance of purchasing by a minumun cost.
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|At the height of Donna Summer's career, a lot of her music had a harder edge, distinguishing her from her peers, especially in dance music.  She wasn't quite \\"street,\\" but she was authentic rather than canned.  With each release she continually blended elements of dance, rock, pop, jazz and R&B.  Throughout her catalog, there is a theme of fame and fortune, struggle and strife and the hidden spiritual dangers lurking in the world.    Bad Girls, Hot Stuff, Who Do You Think You're Fooling, She Works Hard for the Money, Stop Look Listen, Get Ethnic, Love is the Healer, and now Crayons all exemplify Summer's artistic slant.  Ultimately Summer sings of salvation and overcoming strife, but to get there she has to work through some struggles and contradictions inherent in the human experience.    Fame (The Game) is a direct extension of Sunset People, both observing a cold and flat world masquerading as \\"real.\\"  She doesn't deny the seductive quality of this world, nor does she judge it.  The low rider character in Drivin' Down Brazil is affectionately characterized with his \\"thousand single dollar bills / in his low ride Bonneville.\\"  No Mercedes for this urban king.      Almost as an escape from the trials and tribulations of all the idolatry, Summer still knows how to make people dance.  It's Only Love, available on an import version of Crayons, and I'm A Fire are smooth classy dance songs with both up-to-the-minute production and vintage Summer songwriting and singing.    Be Myself Again is perhaps the most personal and intimate take from Summer's perspective; she opens up about how that seductive and glossy world affected her directly.  This is wisdom from the woman who's been Running For Cover her whole career.    Crayons, Sand on my Feet, and Stamp Your Feet are each an excellent representative of their genres - pop with reggae, acoustic rock, and pop with dance.  All taken together, the longtime fan will notice the familiar themes and the maturation of her take onthem.  New fans will experience what an excellent and original artist Donna Summer is.    As a post-script, some people are initially put off by the modern studio tricks Crayons possesses (like the cruel fate that fell on Mistaken Identity).  But remember, Summer has always on the cutting edge of studio tricks - I Feel Love, Love to Love You, The Wanderer, This Time I Know It's for Real, Get Ethnic, Love is the Healer.  Give Crayons a few listens and give her room to use what is here and now in popular music.  The real Donna Summer is in there, trust me.
B00005JPNZ|1.0|I'll start by saying that I am a huge Indiana Jones fan.  I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark with my uncle when I was 11-years old.  I have watched the original trilogy over and over with my own kids...they are true classics.  I was excited to take my own 8-year old to see this newest Indiana Jones adventure so we braved the crowds and headed out to the theatre on opening night.  I will not give away any plot details but I found myself actually laughing at some of the major themes and action sequences within the movie.  In case you are wondering...it DOES NOT feel like an Indiana Jones movie.  It does not feel right.  If you are a fan of the originals, watch this and you will see exactly what I mean.  I don't think that I've ever left the theatre actually feeling angry. I was actually angry that they took an iconic character like Indiana Jones and turned him into what you see in this film.  Yes, my expectations were high but why shouldn't they have been.  Look at the last three films and the impact they have had on American culture.  Take the character of Indy out of this movie and you have a very bad science fiction movie with sub-standard CGI and scenes where you look over at whoever you're seeing the movie with and just give that \\"What the ----?\\" look.  Remember, I AM an Indiana Jones fan.  This was NOT an Indiana Jones movie.
B0018CA996|1.0|Everybody I know kept asking me \\"HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEW PORTISHEAD?!\\", so I was really looking forward to it.     I have to say it is a huge letdown.  I'm not sure why everyone is so excited about this album, it's awful!  Boring, unoriginal, not at all pleasing to the ears.  What gives?
B0000844M8|5.0|This review pertains to the March 2003 DVD release of \\"Born Free\\". The picture and sound are fantastic! This issue presents a remastering of this relatively old film--and it looks brand new! The picture is sharp and the colors are rich and accurate. The format is anamorphic widescreen, so it looks great on a large screen TV. I viewed this movie on a 46-inch Samsung high defintion LCD TV, played on a Toshiba 1080p HD DVD player--and it looks stunning!    Of course, the movie itself is worthwhile--and this remastered version makes it even more worthwhile to own and watch again and again. Highly recommended!
0440243661|4.0|Jack Reacher believes in vigilante justice. He is also a drifter who prefers to make no plans and lives from day to day purely on his cash and brawn. He also happens to be the hero of this series of books which is now in its 12th iteration.<br /><br />In this book we learn more about the Military Police unit that Jack commanded. It was apparently a special investigations unit that was formed under Jack's command and dealt with all the unsavory problems that the military could find no one else to deal with. Unlike most police organizations, this unit did not believe in policies and procedures and took all kinds of liberties with the law to achieve their goals. Definitely a groups of people who believed that the end justified the means!<br /><br />Now, 15 years after the unit has disbanded. Jack gets a coded message that asks for help. Since the unit was very tightly knit he cannot ignore the request and so he answers the call. The call comes in because one of the unit members is dropped from a helicopter from a height of 3000 feet causing his death. As Jack starts to investigate, he finds that half the unit is already missing (and presumed dead) and the other half slowly comes together.<br /><br />The investigation of what led to the death of their friend takes the team all across the western United States and involved a top secret organization and all kinds of shenanigans involving missing money and terror organizations. Ultimately the riddles are all solved, the perpertrators are all killed or captured, and the team disbands again to pursue their disparate lives.<br /><br />What's to like about this book? Well, the action is great fun, well written and executed, and allows the story to go on its merry way in a fun and logical path. What's not to like? The main character is a vigilante! At one point in the story he needs some cash, so he goes and robs a group of people. In tune with the apparent moto that the ultimate end justifies the means, the people he robs are actually drug dealers - so that makes it right? The other negative about this is that the body count is incredibly high for a story that supposedly manages to miss being covered by any news articles - yet involves several government organizations. In other words, it is highly unbelievable. Maybe that lack of credibility is what I found to be so much fun! I could barely put the book down as I always wanted to read \\"just one more chapter...\\"!!!<br /><br />Recommended.makes it right?

B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is such a wonderful show and a great first season.  I highly recommend giving it a try.  It has something for nearly everyone and it is not just a chick show.  I know quite a few men, my husband included, who adore this series as much as me.  It always seems to elevate our mood because it offers so much.<br /><br />It is not a comedy or a drama but a perfect blend of both.  The lines are hysterical and full of wit.  The actors are perfect for their parts and seriousness and deep thougts ensue at the best moments.<br /><br />At least give it a try. I really doubt that you will be disappointed.
B000002N1E|5.0|\\"The Gold Experience\\" (1995) is an essential Prince recording that ranks favorably with \\"1999\\" and \\"Sign 'O' the Times.\\" For 65 glorious minutes, His Royal Badness delivers one classic after another: \\"Endorphinmachine,\\" \\"Shhh,\\" \\"We March,\\" \\"Shy,\\" \\"Billy Jack B---h\\" and the transcendently brilliant \\"Dolphin.\\" Though criminally out of print, this treasure trove of rock and soul belongs in every Prince collection.
B0007TKNKG|5.0|Normally I'm not one for hyperbole, but I have few qualms stating that Over the Top is among the greatest arm-wrestling movies of the last half-century.  Jam-packed with emotion, adrenaline, and the kind of edge-of-your-seat action that only two stationary, grunting men can provide, it's easy to see why many call it the \\"'Gone With the Wind' of wrist-endurance sport movies\\".     Like every screenplay written by Sylvester Stallone, Over the Top boasts a challenging and all-too plausible script-- in this case a cautionary tale about a sensitive trucker seeking to find redemption, the love of the son he abandoned, and most importantly, a new truck, through arm-wrestling. And while most actors and/or filmmakers would scoff at the idea of tackling such hot-button issues as overcoming the scars of child abandonment through competitive bicep-grappling, the fearless cast and crew of Over the Top are unafraid to take this plunge. In fact, they treat their subject with a reverence and photo-accurate attention to detail unmatched in modern cinema, so much so that it's easy at times to forget that you're watching a work of fiction and not a documentary.      The emotional roller-coaster that is this film also provides yet another showcase for Mr. Stallone's spine-tingling acting chops, as his emotional, monosyllabic father-son scenes remain some of the most courageous ever captured on film.       Attention Hollywood: the ticket-buying public has spoken.  And we expect Over the Top's return engagement to a theater near us sooner rather than later.
B00005MCX0|4.0|This 1971 album is somewhat different from albums like Hall of the Mountain Grill (1974) and Warriors on the Edge of Time (1975) in that the mellotron is not used at all and synthesizers are not layered as thickly.  This was 1971 after all so this was to be expected.  Admittedly however, there is a good deal of electronic experimentation on what sounds a lot like a VCS3 by Del Dettmar and Dik Mik Davies, in addition to various tape effects.<br /><br />In terms of musical styles, this is essentially space rock with a bit of a heavy edge to it.  Former Amon Duul II bassist Dave Anderson and Terry Ollis (drums) lend the music a thumping, at times almost simplistic \\"garage-band-like\\" sound but are capable of somewhat sensitive playing as well.  Both of these guys left the band around this time only to be replaced by Lemmy and Simon King respectively.<br /><br />Spacey instrumentals that feature swirling electronic effects, altered flute/saxophone parts and the raw pounding of the rhythm section (the 15:41 \\"You Shouldn't Do That\\" is a good example) alternate with \\"straighter\\" vocal passages and sections that feature acoustic guitars.  In general, I really like the combination of the spacey / acoustic and the heavier instrumental sections.  Come to think of it, the instrumental passages reminded me somewhat of Syd-Barrett era Pink Floyd epics like Interstellar Overdrive (1967).  The melodies are a bit gloomy sometimes (minor keys seem to be favored) and the overall feel is very psychedelic.<br /><br />This remastered album by EMI is great and features good sound quality, loads of liner notes and photos and a few bonus tracks that feature Lemmy and Simon King.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fine album of early space rock that features decent use of electronic experimentation.  Recommended along with Hawkwind (1970), Hall of the Mountain Grill and Warriors on the Edge of Time.

B00104W8T6|4.0|There's a very nice simplicity to the songs in the Juno Soundtrack which is a very fitting companion to the movie. The mix of songs span the decades...from Buddy Holly in `50s, to Kimya Dawson in this decade.<br /><br />Kimya Dawson is a dominant force behind much of the \\"feel\\" of the album. Of the 19 tracks, she has a total of 8 songs (if you count Moldy Peaches and Antsy Pants). Her quirky, Lo-Fi sound went perfectly with the film. Her self recorded songs are just her vocals and an acoustic guitar with very simple, non-threatening(except for \\"Tree Hugger\\")lyrics. A perfect listen when you're not in any particular mood and just want to unwind.<br /><br />Some other inclusions on the Soundtrack that I was happy about were The Kinks, Sonic Youth, and especially Belle & Sebastian with 2 songs. I've been listening to this disc constantly over the past 7 days and still haven't gotten tired of it...which says a lot coming from someone with such a short attention span.<br /><br />*I give it 4 and 1/2 stars instead of 5 only because I found the 2, short (under 1 minute) intrumental tracks did nothing for me.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|If your looking for Amy Winehouse here, don't. If you're looking for Dusty Springfield here, you can forget that, too, for the most part. What you'll find, mainly, is an amazing album that harkens to the ghosts of Cilla Black and Lulu from the British 60s. Both of thos artists cycled both Mersey pop and R&B ala Motown through their mod singles. Although both Winehouse and Springfield can be peripherally referenced here, it's a lazy reference at best; both of those artists are high profile at the moment, whether it be by chart status (Winehouse) or nostalgic homage (ala Shelby Lynne's latest). If you want a true point of reference for this gifted singer with fabulous taste and a great new (old) sound, go back to the early sixties Brit jukebox.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halens first is the best. Running With The Devil, Eruption, Ain't Talkin About Love, Little Dreamer. This cd started it all. 5 stars.
B00154GEFU|4.0|When press started leaking out about a new Asia album from the original quartet, the band members all went out of their way to say that they were going to pick up where their first two albums left off.  After hearing _Phoenix_, you have to give Wetton, Downes, Palmer & Howe credit for sticking to their word.  It's simultaneously amazing and unremarkable that _Phoenix_ sounds nearly identical to _Asia_ and _Alpha_, mind you, but with a LITTLE less of an 80s feel.  But...just a little.    The songs are still drenched in lush keyboards & production and Wetton's schmaltzy lyrics, but g*d dammit if these songs are not catchy.  The high points of the album are Wetton's incredibly strong voice and Howe's excellent, fiery guitar work.  The band goes for \\"Heat of the Moment 08\\" with \\"Never Again.\\"   Howe's dreamy, sustained guitar lines at the beginning of \\"Heroine\\" echo \\"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes\\" -- for all it's schmaltz, it's actually a nice little track.  \\"Alibis\\" supposedly dates back to the early 80s as a song the band worked on called \\"Jodie\\", and it definitely sounds like something that could've appeared on _Astra_ but with really nice back and forth keyboard and guitar runs from Howe and Downes towards the end.  It's actually great to hear Downes & Howe working together again since I've always felt that their work together on Yes' _Drama_ is some of the best guitar-keys interplay out of all of the Yes albums.  The remainder of the tracks are much of the same in that they really sound as if they could've come from any of the first three Asia albums.  Whereas the Payne-era Asia of the 90s and 00s seemed to really be trying to update their sound--but usually still sounding dated, the original quartet are doing what they are known for in Asia and succeeding on that level, but I can't imagine any non-fan getting into them with this album.  There are some exceptions however. The mini-suites \\"Sleeping Giant\\" and \\"Parallel Worlds\\" have a more progressive tinge than the original two Asia albums had and, in this instance, it does sound like something that could've come from _Aura_ or _Silent Nation_ (or for Yes fans, something off of _Keys 1 &2_); \\"Wish I'd Known All Along\\" is a strange beast as well.  A Howe composition in lyrics and music, it also is more reminiscent of 90s Asia like _Arena_.       With Wetton's health problems from 2007, the overall theme of _Phoenix_, as written in the liner notes, is 'carpe diem.'  Quite appropriate for the band as they are all soon entering their twilight years.  However, it's great to hear them collectively making a strong album when so many bands from their era just don't even want to bother.  You have to give them credit for that.  This album is what it is -- if you love Asia, you'll like this album.  If you do not like them, don't bother.
B000002JKS|1.0|POOR SOUND QUALITY MAKES A POOR CD EVEN WORSE.    This is Robert Plant's third solo CD.  It was released in 1985, during the early days of CD's.  Like many early CD's the sound quality is poor (which is why there were vinyl snobs who thought CD's were worthless).      Most of the songs on this CD are a mess.  Each song does have some redeeming values but most songs also have some really bad parts.  The songs are uneven and all over the place.  With the poor sound quality, many of the songs are just hard to listen to.    When you listen to a song more than once, your mind will focus on one part of it and then tend to ignore the rest.  If your mind focuses on the good parts of the songs, you will like this CD, but your mind will tend to drift during the part you don't like.  This is why people routinely say that they did not like a CD at first, but it grew on them.  If you mind has developed a negative impression, it will focus on the bad parts of the CD and you will hate this.    There are some good songs on the CD.  Little by Little is an excellent song and a sign of what was to come on later CD's.  Too Loud and Sixes and Sevens are OK throughout.      All the songs are so much more enjoyable on the Remastered version.    The enhanced sound enhances the listening experience.    Plants first 3 solo CD's were not well received.  He blew everyone away with his fourth, Now and Zen (not including the Honeydrippers).
B000I0QLZU|4.0|I give the movie 5 stars as an exciting imaginitive adventure movie.  But there are issues with the Blu-ray version - which are:  The movie was not photographically focused with HD video in mind.  Sometimes the details are clearly in focus, sometimes the details are only DVD clear.  This is better than an ordinary DVD \\"upconverted\\" but is not consistently what I would expect from a true Blu-ray quality movie.  If you already own the DVD it may not be worth upgrading - but if you don't I think it is worth it for adventure movie fans.    This is based on the original Blu-ray disk release.
B000YAA68W|4.0|This autobiographical animated feature dealing with the coming of age of a young girl in Iran during the revolutionary period is witty and engaging all way through, as well as technically brilliant, yet its narrow middle class view makes you wince from time to time. Co director Marjanne Satrapi, born in 1969 into a progressive middle class Iranian family, tells how as a young girl she witnessed the fall of the shah, the coming of the Islamic regime, the brutal Iran-Iraq war, how she was sent during the mid 1980s to Austria by her family, where she saw first hand some of the nihilistic life style of European youth, how there she fell into drugs and almost die after a doomed love affair, how she returned to Iran in the early 90s, enrolling in the university and getting into an ill fated marriage before going to exile to France. Made in engaging black and white, 2D animation, and full of faux naif touches, the problem with this movie is Satrapi's inability to see what happened in Iran outside the narrow view of Iran's westernized middle class. In fact, the working class of Iran is virtually absent from the movie. And her personal complaints (about how her right to consume trash culture from the west was infringed) seems petty and trivial (to her credit, she does realize this from time to time, as when she meets an old childhood friend, a crippled veteran from the war). The film ugliest bit is when the girl's mother complains that the new administrator in a hospital in newly revolutionary Iran used to be a window washer.
0553208845|5.0|SIDDHARTHA, by Hermann Hesse, is a heroic adventure of personal growth.<br /><br />As Joseph Campbell taught us, many works of fiction serve as symbolic case studies of personal growth. But I think SIDDHARTHA is the best, the most deliberate, the most allegorical, of all. SIDDHARTHA's narrative and metaphors never stray from the title character's self-exploration and development. Due to this tight focus, it comes across as a quite simple tale. That's a nice benefit, since Hesse's story is universally relevant and illuminating.<br /><br />Furthermore, it brilliantly upgrades the Campbell \\"monomyth\\" with a peculiar, placid denouement that shows how profoundly some heroes are transformed by their quests.
B000HWZ5WO|2.0|Released in 1985, this was Robert Plant's third solo album.  Coming out in the early days of CD technology, the sound quality of the original CD was horrible.  It was flat and muddled with no dynamic range.  It was nearly impossible to distinquish any instruments.  The guitars were nearly unintelligible.    This is a keyboard heavy album.  It was recorded in the style of 1980's music, which really needed good, clear, clean sound.      Most of the songs on this album are a mess.  Each song has some redeeming values and most have some excellent parts.  But, as a whole, most of the songs are uneven and are not good as a complete product.  If your mind ignores the band parts and only focuses on the good aspects of the songs, you will enjoy this CD.  If your mind focuses on the bad parts, you will hate this CD, as most people do.    Adding to the problems of these songs was the very poor sound quality of the original CD.  This remaster really improves the enjoyment of the CD.  It doesn't fix the bad parts of the songs, but makes them more tolerable.    There are some exceptions.  Little By Little is an excellent song throughout.  This is sample of what was to come on  later albums.  Too Loud and Sixes and Sevens are moslty good.  These songs go from mediocre to good (and Little By Little goes to great) with the improved sound quality on the remastered version.    Plant's first 3 solo albums were not very good.  They were scorned by the music press (which doesn't always mean anything).  3 years later, Plant would blow everyone away with Now and Zen.

B000NVL9FQ|5.0|Some would probably suggest that \\"Days of Future Passed\\" by The Moody Blues is the first true progressive album. True, it was innovative. Classical, yet mixed with rock. But, that doesn't quite define \\"Progressive\\". I think the first progressive rock concept LP has to be \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\", by King Crimson. And I'm sure other countries had their \\"prog\\" concept bands beginning around 1969.<br /><br />But what makes Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's debut LP so important is that the three members came from other experimental rock projects. Three individuals, and three individually powerful performers. Three people who could entertain an audience doing a solo performance, not necessarily needing the others to help enhance their performance. Yes, three commanding forces in their own spotlights on the stage before the world to see.<br /><br />Before ELP, the only bands that we knew all the band members by name were really only The Beatles and maybe The Rolling Stones. ELP was the first band to really give us all pre-conceived expectations of what they can do. The first SuperGroup! Who would have thought that all that \\"ego\\" could work together without competing with each other, or get in each others way?<br /><br />This first album by ELP was either going to be a super success, or sudden death for the Prog genre! This was an album that sounded like nothing else out there. It was definitely the one first album to shape the future of many Progressive Rock bands throughout the early to mid Seventies. It was the one album that other experimental Prog bands measured their concepts and goals to. The one album all Progressive Rock lovers praised, and, still to this day, cherish. Often imitated, but never equaled by any measure.<br /><br />ELP's first album is what defines what progressive rock truly is. ELP's follow-up albums were unique as well. New ideas always came to ELP. But, new progressive bands were growing all around and were competing with ELP with the concept that they created. And eventually, ELP was just lost in the wash of other Prog bands during that era. But, loyalty always goes to the first, of course. The innovator must never be overlooked.<br /><br />Although other famous Prog bands followed, such as Strawbs, Yes, Pink Floyd, Triumvirat, The Moody Blues, and many others, but Emerson, Lake, and Palmer is the most famous, and most recognized Progressive Rock band in history.nd eventually, ELP was just lost in the wash of other Prog bands during that era.

0670018651|5.0|Five stars for the writing.  I cannot remember a book that gave me more pleasure.  It's a great read, rich with fascinating details about  scents I've never tried. I'm not a perfumista, don't read the myriad perfume blogs, and frankly, don't even know why I like the perfumes I like. Besides reading this book for fun - especially the hilarious one-star reviews -- I'm using it to learn. It's a road map to hundreds of perfumes to try.  I spray those little sniff strips, later seal each in a plastic snack bag so I can re-evaluate it for days and attempt to understand the experts' points of view. Then I sleep with one strip on my pillow for one  night, hoping for wonderful dreams.  Aromatics Elixir produced technicolor giggles. Had I not read this book, I would never have looked to Clinique for a fabulous perfume.  Another  discovery is good ole (manly) Stetson, described here as \\"a crisp classical feminine oriental...gorgeous, as rugged and masculine as the lingerie level at Saks...\\" Who knew? I'm now using this wonderful el cheapo as air spray in my musty book lined office.      I've admired Luca since stumbling upon Chandler Burr's The Emperor of Scent at the library (and still like vibrations better than molecules), then read his Secrets of Scent, at least the civilian-friendly first half, and ordered my Amazon copy of this guidebook months ago.  Who wouldn't gravitate toward a scientist who, as Burr reported, was scrambling for a Nobel Prize on one hand and on the other describing an iconic perfume as something that should be hanging in a Moscow taxi.       Luca has major creds, but who is this Tanya person?  She won me over on page 12, describing how people get interested in perfume. For me, it's the Tabu factor: Mumsy always wore it and from my earliest days I thought the world smelled of (the old) Tabu, Lucky Strikes, martinis and snowflake-sprinkled fur. And then of the wonderful old greasy green Replique, Joy, Zizanie and Ma Griffe my father brought home from Paris and my first purchase, Jolie Madame.  What was not to love?   I appropriated the Replique and wore it to grade school and on into adulthood, miss it still, and have no idea what it was I loved about it. As Tanya said, all perfume lovers have long, fond memories.  It's sad that so many older perfumes have been discontinued or reformulated beyond recognition and I agree with an earlier reviewer that critiques of some discontinued classics would have been welcome.      I may not understand the structure of perfume, but I do know about the structure of books.  This is reasonably good but another few months of work might have produced a masterpiece. I wish the publisher's production people had thought harder about a few things:  First, the white cover may be striking but it's impractical for a book designed to be schlepped back and forth to the store.  Ditto the page size. I'd prefer a wider page with room to make notes. Actually, a trade paperback with a binding that lies flat would have been ideal.  The 12-page star index is jammed and nearly unreadable.   I miss having a real index. Eliminating some inconsequential perfumes that garnered only a one-sentence critique would have freed up space for an index, an opportunity to  list by type, by company,  and by designer.      But that's technical stuff.  I love this book enough to give it five stars anyway.. It contributes color, wit, and delight to an increasingly unrecognizable world where control freaks nail \\"fragrance free zone\\" signs on far too many doors and wearing perfume is considered as undesirable as smoking. In my city, anyway. Thanks to this book, perfume sales surely will increase.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|If you like challenging and creative pop music, go ahead and take a chance on this beautifully textured and surprisingly  up to date CD.    You do not have to be a diehard fan to appreciate this CD.     This is one of those CD's where the tunes are so catchy, and the songs so diverse that you pick the ones you like best on a given day, and then pick some more the next. There is a lot to love on this CD if you love hearing a great vocalist run the tables with her voice. Like most people, the  highest praise I can give a CD is when I keep the motor running in my car  ( at $3.99 a gallon and ticking  in Atlanta people!!) to hear the rest of a song , and then hit replay, etc etc ...I have been doing that a lot with Crayons!!    Songs I liked best-- the more rockish Fame ...also  Science of Love should be on top 40 radio( Hot Stuff, My Baby Understands  and the whole Wanderer album are what  sent me over the top forevermore with Donna Summer fyi). Stamp Your Feet has stadium anthem written all over it, and deserves to be one.  The one I hit rewind  on in my car A LOT is Be Myself Again-what a gorgeous vocal  !!    Slide Over Backwards makes you do a double take and just grows on you with each listen with a blues and Macy Gray vibe. The Queen is Back, Bringing Down the rain....on and on go I! There is a lot of creativity and  diversity going on here .      Bottom line,the voice  of Donna Summer can do so much- and holds all these colors and palates together into one really wonderful portrait of an artist  ( sorry , no more crayola talk!!)     Thanks to her for this wonderful valentine of a CD. I think it is one that will be played over and over again by a lot of people- not all of them dance fans!!     Go for it:)
B000067DNC|5.0|For those fans that came into the show kind of late, I think this season signifies just how much the team really means to one another and what they go through on a daily basis. Season 1 may have began the series, but this is where the show really gets going and explains about some of the bigger issues for all the main characters and the supporting cast. Fans who had seen the later seasons need to watch the core of the show and that begins with the first half of the series and the first 2 seasons. Like any fan, I think that they shouldn't have canceled the show and kept it going, but at the least the movies tied up the loose ends. buy this season you won't be disappointed.
1423101464|5.0|I am a hard-core fan of the Percy Jackson books from Rick Riordan! I love the connection between Greek mythology and the modern world. So, the gods of myth are still with us and still procreating with humans! will they never learn? =)<br />Percy Jackson is a demigod, the offspring of a mortal woman and the god Poseidon. Percy's half-brother is a Cyclops who is sweet and adorable, but he's a Cyclops for Pete's sake! Percy's best friends consist of Annabeth (daughter of Athena) and Grover (a satyr who is on a mission to find the god of the wild-Pan himself) and the stories are about their adventures and misadventures as half-bloods who are out to balance the imbalance between the Titans of old and the gods of Olympia and at the same time save the modern world from total destruction (if Kronos has his way). It's a battle as old as Gaea herself (mother earth). The adventures are intriguing at the beginning, exciting at their climax and fulfilling at the end. I highly recommend the Percy Jackson series to young and old! They are a VERY refreshing respite from wizards and witches!
0307455874|4.0|The book that catapulted Barack Obama to power, this work is important in several respects to the present American. In this work, Obama explains his core philosophies. This being said, the informed voter can gain a keep insight into Obama morally as well as politically through the Audacity of Hope. Politics aside, the book is well-written and easy to read, which is what this review is, at its core, about. Does it represent something transformative? Probably not, as reality is always different than ideology, but it is still important to read such a book with importance to the current President of the United States.
0143038583|4.0|Reading this book might change the way you view the world and the food we consume.  If you are not ready for a shift in your thinking, you are not ready for this book.  I would have given it 5 stars but the writing style lags a little. The content, however, makes up for it.      Yikes!  What hath modern man wrought???
1416550518|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book! Kate Morton is an excellent writer and can turn a phase well. Grace Bradley lived a full and exciting life, first as a ladies maid and eventually as an archaelogist. But at 99 years of age, she can't forget the night Robbie died, and her part in the tragedy. A riveting read.
0756404746|5.0|I understand how readers might argue this book is overly long.  And with so many new, doorstop-size fantasy books being released, it seems reasonable to wonder if new authors are paid per word.  Yes, there were a couple of sequences here that probably could've been trimmed or cut entirely and some of the action did indeed seem as if it might not be adding to the plot.    But I barely noticed.    I probably wouldn't have noticed at all if not for reading some of the reviews posted here before buying.  Twenty or so pages in, I was absolutely hooked.  This story, for me, was an escapist dream.  Opening the pages at lunch, before bed and during spare time on the weekends became a tiny excursion, a vacation in words and imagery.     I won't bother with a long (or short) synopsis; there are plenty of other reviews here that provide that.  For me, this book was a tour de force of charactering development and, to a lesser degree, world building.  Kvothe became a living, breathing person and I found myself  forgetting that he never existed.  Page after page flowed right along as I suffered in Kvothe's losses, shared his triumphs and rooted for him to `get the girl.'      I thought that Rothfuss did, at times, depict Kvothe as almost too god-like in talent and natural ability to be believable as a vulnerable and flawed human being.  But this was only a minor distraction (especially in the beginning), and it never detracted from the book as a whole.  I thought that Kvothe's love interest here was a bit under developed as well.  It seemed almost as if Rothfuss was holding back with her, intentionally making her a mystery in order to add complexity in subsequent books.  Again, only a minor disappointment.    The influence of the Harry Potter series here seems undeniable, but then again, as has been pointed out in other reviews, the `destitute orphan goes to the University of Wizardry, becomes powerful wizard and rises above station to a special destiny' has been done many timesin fantasy.  There are other obvious influences here as well, but despite that, this is a wholly original world and story, and a complex, believable protagonist.  When I finished the last page, I didn't want the story to end; I'm already thinking about rereading and have preordered the second book.  And finally, I thought Rothfuss's use of 3rd and 1st person narration was a clever touch that added complexity and believability to the world, to the protagonist, and to the story.     So though this book might, in places, have benefited from an editor and from some judicious cutting, I certainly wouldn't have been the person for that job; I wouldn't omit a single letter.

B00005JPSM|5.0|Katherine Zeta-Jones plays a master chef at a NYC restaurant with no time for anything or anyone else in her life. That is, until her niece (Abigail Breslin) comes to live with her, then subtle changes begin to take place. During this time, a sous-chef (Aaron Eckhart) is hired at the restaurant (without her knowledge) and he brings with him several changes, both to the restaurant and to Katherine Zeta-Jones' life.  The script is light and easy and the acting excellent. This is a cute movie and worth viewing.
B0014YVC6W|5.0|My wife and I just finished watching this on blu-ray and the visual quality is truly stunning.  It compares favorably even to some of the latest release blu-ray movies.  I wasn't expecting too much, but it's definitely worthwhile in high-def - the robots look super sharp, landscapes / fields look almost 3D.    The subtitles appear to be closed captioned (description of background sounds, applause, etc).    The movie itself is obviously a timeless classic - we love it!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I've bought  5 albums this year and wasn't thrilled with any of them until I finally got to Duffy. This girl singer from Wales is simply amazing. Her voice has a kitten trying to sound tough quality that reminds me of the Ronnettes or a very young Aretha Franklin. This is a gorgeous album. The wall of sound is a thrill to listen to especially on Mercy and Distant Dreamer. The lyrics make sense, you can sing along and not be embarrassed at mouthing nonsense. Plus, although this goes through all the stages of young love you won't be ashamed to have your mom or your kid catch you listening to it.     Duffy has a piece of work to be proud of. I loved this.
B000002KIT|5.0|This album goes beyond being another great album. There are lots of \\"great\\" albums that pale in comparison to L&D.  This album documents more than any other Thin Lizzy work the phenomonally great songwriting and musicianhship of Thin Lizzy.  The guitar tandem here is arguably the best ever in recorded music.  I am lucky enough to have seen them live on the Chinatown tour.  I have seen multitudues of concerts and have not seen an audience slayed with such ferocity as Thin Lizzy on that night.  No live recording can ever recreate the experience of being there.  However, Live and Dangerous comes as close you can get.      I have heard all of the other live Thin Lizzy albums available.  Don't bother.  They all pale badly in comparison to the original Live & Dangerous.      Buy this album and revel in its innate \\"greatness\\".
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Planet Earth is by far the most intertaining DVD I own and I have a lot.  I am amazed at times how they were able to film many scenes.Just breath  taking.I have recommended this series to all my family and friends and  bought a set for my brother for his birthday because he loves nature and  animals as much as I do. Can't wait for BBC to film another documentary  equal to this one and I know they can.
0307394549|5.0|Martha Stewart's Cookies is a lovely cookbook (there is a photo that accompanies each cookie) filled with delicious recipes for cookie lovers everywhere. I missed an opportunity to buy her special magazine (a few Christmases ago) devoted to cookies, so I was thrilled to learn that she had published a cookbook full of cookie recipes.    The book is broken down into the following sections; \\"light and delicate,\\" \\"soft and chewy,\\" \\"crumbly and sandy,\\" \\"chunky and nutty,\\" \\"cakey and tender, \\" \\"crisp and crunchy,\\" and \\"rich and dense.\\" The contents are shown literally with each section displaying the cookies (photos) and the page where the recipe can be found. I've only had this book for a few days and couldn't wait to bake the Giant Chocolate Sugar Cookies (crumbly and sandy section). They were amazing and indeed crumbly and sandy, perfect with vanilla ice cream while still a little warm.    This is a beautiful book, with a lot of attention to detail (of course, it's Martha Stewart) and I look forward to using it countless times!
B00005JPNZ|5.0|This is an excellent continuation of the Indiana Jones series. Steven  Speilberg has made another excellent movie. Indiana Jones has gotten greyer since his last Indiana Jones Movie.    This movie starts out with a base is New Mexico being taken over by Russians. You are introduced to the personna of evil Dr. Irina Spalko played by Cate Blanchette. She are her KGB goons are on the base after a box that is stored there. Indiana Jones has been taken hostage by the Russians to help find the box that the KGB is looking for. After a running gun battle and a atomic blast Jones escapes.

The ending of the movie is spectacular. Be sure to go and see this movie. It is definitely a winner.

If you are a professionnal, you will make a presentation in a few days, weeks or months, so do yourself and your audience a great service and pick up this book.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|After being thoroughly disappointed with an episode from the second season of \\"Masters of Horror\\" I was still flipping through the horror section under Showtime On Demand.  I clicked on \\"Dexter\\" and read the synopsis about a vigilante serial killer with a girlfriend who wants a commitment.  I had never heard of any story like this before.  I was hooked right from the first episode.    The opening sequence of \\"Dexter\\" sets the dark humored tone.  The camera follows him through an ordinary morning routine that is filmed in a ghastly fashion utilizing uncomfortable close-ups that get right in your face and under your skin: Dexter shaving and dabbing at his nicks with a paper towel, the deliberately slow cutting and cooking of food that looks more like dismemberment than anything culinary, a stream of tobasco sauce on fried eggs that resembles blood, the remains of a freshly squeezed blood orange that looks like a mutilated corpse, and the use dental floss and lacing of shoestrings that evoke thoughts of confinement or strangulation.      Then Dexter puts on a t-shirt and stares into the camera with the feral eyes of a hungry predator.  His face is lighted from the right, leaving the left side of his face shadowed.  This shot depicts the duality of Dexter: the light-hearted nice guy side he puts up for the world and the dark side that remains meticulously hidden.  Finally we see him exit his apartment with a nod and smile to the camera, as if to assure us that the bloodthirsty beast we saw in his apartment is kept on a very short leash.     Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is a vigilante serial killer.  After accumulating enough solid evidence about his target, he moves in for the kill.  His victims are murderers, pedophiles, arsonists, black widows, and other assorted creeps that the world could do without.  When he's not taking out the human trash, he works as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department.  At work Dexter puts up a friendly, easy-goingpersona.  He is a consummate professional and a brilliant forensics expert who gets results.      At the department he works with his sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), a foul-mouthed cop with a bright mind, but very lacking in confidence and political savvy.  There is also forensics analyst Matsuka (CS Lee.), the friendly pervert with a sick sense of humor.  Sgt. Doakes (Erik King), is as Dexter puts it, the only one in a room full of cops who is suspicious of him.  Doakes is a tough cop but his detective skills are rather mediocre.  Angel Batista (George Zayas) is a far better investigator who appreciates and respects all of Dexter's hard work.  Angel and Dex in partricular make a great team.  Leading the homicide division is Lt. Maria LaGuerta: tough, ruthless, but too vain for her own good.  She has the hots for Dexter and this naturally unsettles him.    For several months, Dexter has been dating Rita, a single mother of two who suffered years of horrid abuse at the hands of her drug addict husband who is now in prison.  As Dexter puts it Rita is perfect for him because \\"she is, in her own way, just as damaged as me\\".      This is the neat little world of lies in which Dexter lives: days of honest work, nights off with a girlfriend, and the occasional act of vigilante justice.  However all of this is turned upside down with the arrival of a killer soon to be known as The Ice Truck Killer.  The ITK leaves clean, bloodless, frozen remains of hookers right out in public for all the world to see.  Dexter can't help but to admire the meticulous and precise handiwork of this new killer.  The presence of the ITK sets of a chain of events that will change Dexter's world forever.      The show is based on a series of novels written by Jeff Lindsay.  While the books focus entirely on Dexter who narrates, the series however, delves more into the lives of the supporting characters creating enough plot (and sub-plots) to sink your teeth into.  The entire cast turns in greatperformances that grow with the characters they portray.      Actor Michael C. Hall has said in interviews that Dexter really isn't emotionless, but he is emotionally frozen. Right from episode one we see some evidence: his righteous anger at a pedophile [\\"OPEN YOUR EYES AND LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID!\\"], his dedication to his sister [\\"If I had feelings for anyone, I'd have them for Deb.\\"], the tenderness he feels for Rita [\\"Normal people can be so hostile......but never her.....\\"]. Dexter may tell us that he is hollow inside , but he doesn't know that he's just frozen, nor does he realize just how much he has already begun to thaw out.    In a world of endless CSI and crime drama franchises, it's refreshing to see a new spin on an idea that is running out of steam.  It is uncertain how long and how far this show can go, but with a third season coming up, \\"Dexter\\" shows no signs of slowing down.  If you're in the mood for something dark, cynical, and sarcastic, this is the show for you
B0013HA838|5.0|He who procrastinates finds that others get in first.  I was waiting for the weekend to review this wonderful production only to find that Toni Bernhard and Bob Epstein have written much that I would have.  So I will content myself with only a few remarks.<br /><br />David McVicar is indeed a wonderful director.  Judging from the \\"Bonus\\" on the DVD of his \\"Manon\\" of him directing, he is very much hands-on.  He knows what he wants and does not stop until he gets it, usually acting it himself for the performers.  His concepts are inventive and give a different view from the usual without being outrageous, unlike those of some directors I could name.  Mind you, it will not work unless he starts with singers who can act as well, and I suspect that he has a say in the casting.  Certainly all the performers here are wonderful.<br /><br />I was not all that happy with Gerald Finlay playing the Count as such a one-sided brute until he slapped the Countess across the face -- and then the penny dropped.  She is an abused wife, and that makes it all (particularly the forgiveness at the end) much more understandable.  The happy ending is only temporary for the Count and Countess.  In the third play of the Beaumarchais Figaro trilogy, The Count has an illegitimate child; and the Countess has one with Cherubino!!<br /><br />I did not think that the sound was uneven.  My impression is that there was a conscious decision to have the orchestra playing more up-front than as it is usually done.  It did not mask the singers who were always clear, and I was pleased to be able to follow the wonderful orchestration with ease.  Mozart and Pappano make a great combination.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This movie clearly sucked!  So to save everyone the pain of reviewing the whole thing, I think I'll just sum it up.      A.  I didn't know what was going on in the film.    B.  The monster needed more screentime then the actors themselves.    C.  I don't have any idea who the actors were.      D.  It was Blair Witch Project gone completely bad!     E.  All it showed was someone holding a video camera videotapping everything and the monster was never ever destroyed!  Which is actually a good thing because most of the characters needed to go anyways.      To make a long story short, just don't buy this movie for the love of God!  This one is really bad!

B0019OP0GU|5.0|BALLET SHOES (starring Emma Watson... celebrated for her lead roles in the Harry Potter films...along with an all-star acclaimed ensemble cast) is absolutely wonderful. I personally am in love it. Targeting a very large and underserved audience which is best defined as \\"moms and their daughters\\", Ballet Shoes is a film about realizing ambitions; a film where its tag line `dreams do come true' is really the `spot on' underlying message of the film... and the storyline. I believe it is destined to be a huge success for it is a tale of inspiration indeed.     A big-budget Granada film production, originally for the BBC, Ballet Shoes is based on the literary classic penned by Noel Streatfeild that women especially are very familiar with as key reading material from their childhood. A costume drama with absolutely stunning cinematography, the film portrays 1930's London with a sense of dreamy realism. For those who recall the box office smash \\"You've Got Mail\\", the book is the one being sought after that Meg Ryan launches into a verbal expose about. Ms. Ryan was right on the money, as is this adaptation of the tale.    Ballet Shoes is the story of three orphan girls; Petrova, Posie and Pauline (Emma Watson) who are raised as sisters after being brought together by a rich, world traveler as babies. As they grow up, each girl develops a dream of their own. Pauline wants to be an actress; Petrova longs to be an aviator; Posie wishes to dance. Circumstances bring them together, and together they vow to go down in the history books. \\"We three Fossils vow...\\". This vow launches the three Fossil sisters on their voyage, a journey that they travel individually as well as together, one that can only serve to inspire any young girl who watches the film.     On a personal note, I watched this film with my 8 year old daughter and 6 year old son. While my son fought to pay attention (not surprising), my daughter was riveted throughout the film. The appearance of `Hermoine' as a teenbrought her into focus early on, and then the tale itself kept her eyes and ears wide open. She's asked repeatedly to watch Ballet Shoes again, which of course she has. My son, of course, is back to watching `his thing', Spiderman, Superman and The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers...    Ballet Shoes, in a certain sense, is a long form faerie tale, and I recommend it with no reservations whatsoever as superb family viewing.
0582403855|4.0|I think this book is a very good book.  It was required for my LING 316 class and I think it is a very good book for teaching methodology and the principles of teaching English such as explaining how to do various activities within the classroom without making some students feel left out.  I found the text a little difficult to read as it is designed for graduate students, but I seemed to do well reading it aside from that fact.
0385338724|4.0|I thought this book was a very easy read, so its perfect after having a long day.  The story is good and funny. I never thought about something like this so it does make you think in terms of how would I feel if I would forget the past 3 years of my life. I would have been as shocked as Lexi was. Iam same age so I can truely feel what she was going through.   The only thing i didnt like too much is that the ending was obvios. You knwo what would happen so it no suprising end. It was a bit boring. Other than that the book was good.
B000002J1S|5.0|Among Genesis fans, it's just \\"Lamb.\\"  I stayed home to practice guitar instead of going to a Genesis concert in 1974 with my friends, and have been kicking myself ever since.  They performed their new album, complete with Peter Gabriel onstage theatrics to a spellbound audience in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  The bizzare story of a New York City Puerto Rican street punk's journey through the spirit world after nuclear holocost is a concept only Gabriel and Genesis could create and perform, producing irresitable and deep music in the process.  Thirty four years later, it remains unchallenged as at least the greatest \\"rock opera\\" of all time, and to many the greatest album before, after or since by any artist, especially when pitted against the \\"me too\\" music created by today's uninspiring artists.  What happened to this type of creativity? - I'd rather trust a man who works with his hands.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|I love the idea of this movie.  It's execution, on the other hand, was shaky at best.  I don't mind the plot, but the lack of any back story left me with a sense of \\"huh?\\".  I was entertained, the \\"thing\\" was cool from what I was able to see of it, and I didn't get a headache or puke my guts out from motion sickness.  I am a huge fan of J.J. Abrams.  Most things he produces turn to gold, this one maybe silver or bronze.  I'd watch it again if there wasn't anything else on or I just needed some background noise.
0930289234|5.0|I heard about Watchmen back in the 80's when I was still in middle school but was not able to obtain a copy, not many comic shop's back then, so when I realized Amazon was offering a copy I jumped at the oppertunity.<br />This book lives up to all the hype I heard when I was younger, and since i was old enough to understand was was going on back then it was easy to remember all feeling's and emotion's of that decade. I love that Moore put in the \\"villian reviles is plan to heroes\\" cliche in the book with the twist that the heroes, armed with the information, were powerless to stop him. It's a good read, worth adding to any home library or graphic/comic book collection. Now I just have to wait and see how the movie does, can it live up to the book?
B0014CQNTK|5.0|This movie is proberly the best made movie picture in modern times. It deals with serious themes like teenage pregnancy, abortion, adoption and more in a serious but hillarious.

B0013FXWU6|4.0|Another real doozy of film from 2007.  I love PT Anderson and this is another winner from him.  It plays like one of those major melodramas from the earlier years and does not fail to pull you in in with its theatrics.  Day-Lewis deserved his second Oscar for sure and damn if Paul Dano is not the exact opposit of his Little Miss Sunshine trip.  It keeps spilling over the brim, but it's sure worthwhile.

B000EULJLU|5.0|5 Years elapsed between new Tool albums, but with this release it was certainly worth the wait.  Tool's reign as one of the top bands in progressive metal remains intact with another killer album, although not without some controversy.  Reviews from fans for this album seem to be the most diverse of any Tool release yet.  Fans of the more hardcore metal school of Tool tend to be disappointed while fans of the more progressive rock school of Tool tend to laud the disc.  I fall into the second category and really think that this album my be their best yet.  Many of the songs are long and although there are some very heavy moments, much of the disc is melodic and even ambient in nature.  For me \\"10,000 Days\\" is a natural progression of a band that continues to evolve.   I like the change of pace to a somewhat more introspective moody style, and for me there is still enough of the heavy brutal Tool on the disc to fill that craving as well.  It is interesting to me that in these times of short attention spans I see reviews complaining that some of the tracks are too long.  Really by progressive rock standards there is nothing overly long on the disc, and I like the fact that Tool is willing to prolong their works beyond the standard 3 minute rock song  Your reaction to this disc will vary depending on your personal musical taste, but for me I think this was one of the top albums released in 2006, and possibly Tool's best so far.
0307120007|2.0|This book is very cute and my son loves it. It just falls apart so easily though and can be very frustrating.
B00005B36H|5.0|\\"Lateraulus\\" was the first album that really hooked me on Tool.  I had tried before with the band's previous effort, but it never really caught me.  This one, however hit me like a ton of bricks right from the beginning.  Being a big fan of progressive rock I like the way Tool fleshes some of these tunes out into longer more substantial tracks.  The first single \\"Schism\\" is great and got a significant amount of airplay on radio and MTV.  Other highlights include \\"The Grudge\\", \\"Parabola\\", and especially \\"Ticks And Leeches\\".  Vocalist Maynard Keenan is at the top of his game throughout this album and drummer Danny Carey continually stands out.  This is another great album from one of today's great bands.

B000ANVPPQ|5.0|One of my favorite John Wayne movies, this is a western version of Taming of the Shrew.  The Duke and Maureen O'Hara show off their famous chemistry, starring as George Washington McLintock and his estranged wife Katherine.  These two fine actors are backed by a strong supporting cast, including Stefanie Powers as daughter Rebbecca, Patrick Wayne as Dev Warren, Yvonne DeCarlo as Louise Warren, Chill Wills as Drago, Strother Martin as Agard, and Jerry Van Dyke as Matt Douglas, Jr, among others.<br /><br />The story is simple.  The Duke is the biggest thing in the town that bears his name.  He's a generous kind of a guy, a drinking and good times kind of fellow.  His wife has separated from him, seeking more social standing then the little town can offer.  She returns to town to welcome her daughter back from college and to try and secure a divorce from GW, leading to some humorous results.  Throw in settlers, some restless Indians, Patrick Wayne and Jerry Van Dyke vying for the attention of GW's daughter, and plenty of booze and you have a madcap romp through the old west.  I won't spoil the plot for anyone, but there's a fantastic fight in a mudpit and a great scene involving whiskey and a staircase that should not be missed!<br /><br />The movie is laugh out loud funny and John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara truly have a fantastic rapport.  It's fun to watch these two feed off of each other.  The movie's not too deep and there is some dated racial humor, mostly involving the Chinese cook and some of the Indians, who are also treated conversely as friends and respected former enemies by McLintock.  Those few gaffes aside, the movie is great family fare, not to be missed.<br /><br />Make sure the version you purchase is the Authentic Collector's Edition.  The movie has never looked or sounded better, the transfer superb.  Based on this edition, I plan to purchase other John Wayne films in this series as well.  The extras are kind of fluffy, but the superior rendering of the film far outweighs any bonus features.ny bonus features.
B00005JPNZ|3.0|I don't know if I was disappointed by this movie because I had such high expectations or indeed, the movie was lacking something. Although there are interesting scenes and good actors, this movie was too hi-tech and  sometimes too unbelievable for my idea of an Indiana Jones movie.

0812975219|4.0|I liked this book.  (Ignore most of the philosophy junk...)    One thing you have to say for this guy.  The book is published in 2004.  He predicts that some hedgefunds trading short treasuries and long sub-prime with 20 times leverage will blow up because they're not factoring in the risk right.  In 2006 four such funds blew up...    The key pieces to walk away with here are....      Don't think YOU KNOW for CERTAIN that something is going to happen or not happen because of history or what you know...    You can't statistically prove that something won't happen because it has never happened before.    That most of what's on the news is rubbish or hype...  (Which I buy because most of it is either dumbed down or cut short that the meat is missing... )    Most market movement is noise...    People need to evaluate not only the probability of an event or a move up or down...   but you have to factor in the amounts/size of that movement.  Example:  So if you make a dollar a day for 99/100 days only to loose 1000 dollars in one bad day, is that a bet worth taking...    Limit your use of leverage or know the downside.
0385507755|5.0|I just finished this book, and I while I had heard about the controversy surrounding this book before reading it, and taking everything written with a grain of salt, this book is still incredible!!! Even if the arrest and some of the deaths in the book were not completely accurate, the descriptions of what he and other people addicted to drugs must go through HAS to be real, and thus, his book is still an amazing literary accomplishment. It truly is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It inspired me and is a book that I will probably think about for quite a while, especially those times when it feels like my life sucks. It could be worse! ;-) So, to everyone that thinks that this book is not worth a read because of all the controversy... open your world to just experience the emotions of the story and learn a little more about what \\"humanity\\" is... We all need each other and although we can only truly depend on ourself in life, without people caring about us, and people to care about, life could be very difficult. This book made me doubly appreciate the good things that I still have. This book is now one of my favorite books! Excellent read!
0374105235|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end. Its tough to take in..but very worthwhile.     A heartbreaking story but definitely recommended.
0451196716|4.0|This book is about a contest in an alternate world where young boys start walking once a year, and basically whomever is left standing at the end is the winner.  This details one specific contestant as he is about to begin his trek along with the other boys.  It is a great read, a very easy book to pick up and finish, and the whole concept of the thing will stick in your brain.  If you like Mr. King's books than I would highly recommend this one.
B000FGGE68|4.0|[[ASIN:0800195175 The Fifth Element]]with Milla Jovovich made me a fan.<br />Again she has a superhero type role but with violet hair instead of red.<br />This reminds me very much of the [[ASIN:B00005JMEW Kill Bill, Volume 1]]<br />with Uma Thurman,but Ms. Jovovich doesn't have big feet.<br />Even faking playing with swords and guns is dangerous work.<br />My opinion is that Jovovivh can hold up on acting if she would try such roles. These films about virus killing off or mutating the human race are getting pretty old and too many of them!<br />This one is very well done with pretty good special effects.
B00000F169|5.0|I first saw \\"Dark Star\\" at a mid-1970s sci-fi convention, not long after it had come out. I was a kid back then, but I was instantly hooked, and 30+ years later I still appreciate the intelligence and mordant, dark humor of the script.  The film is decidedly anti-establishment, with a crew of shaggy, longhaired astronauts working as science grunts for an expanding galactic empire, blowing up \\"unstable\\" planets to clear a path for colonization.<br /><br />Although people often compare it to \\"Star Wars\\" (which came out a few years later), \\"Dark Star\\" is much more a precursor of the \\"Aliens\\" series, in which everyday people work for and chafe against vast, anonymous, amoral bureaucracies. As in the \\"Aliens\\" films, the crew of the Dark Star live in a cramped, sweaty, claustrophobic environs, where the vacuum of space is filled with frustration and paranoia.  The confrontation with the damaged, sentient thermonuclear explosive recalls, of course, HAL in Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001,\\" but whereas \\"2001\\" was a very serious film, with Kubrick seeking to blow people's minds with his kaleidoscopic filmmaking, \\"Dark Star\\" is a satire, tempered by dark comedy and outright farce. It's a very funny, very intelligent film, definitely worth picking up!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
0743298039|5.0|I think that's the highest compliment a book can receive. But actually, I listened to the audio version, which was very well done with two narrators. I was caught up in the mystery of who Vida Winter actually was, but she wants her story told in order, without skipping ahead, and Margaret Lea, her biographer, narrates it that way for the most part.<br /><br />\\"Tell me the truth\\" is the haunting line in this story, and sometimes it's best to wait for the right time for the truth to be told. The author doesn't cheat--all the clues were there--but I didn't put them together. All the plot threads were tied up in the end, even some that I hadn't wondered about initially, but probably would have later.<br /><br />I'm very surprised at the reviewers who criticized the writing. I thought it was wonderful. It's not so easy to write a best seller. If it were, everyone would do it.<br /><br />Cindy Thomson, Author of Brigid of Ireland

0307265730|2.0|Unaccustomed Earth is in fact just the opposite of its title- far too familiar, too full of the typical.     The voices of her characters in this book melt completely into the Namesake, or The third and final continent (from Interpreter of Maladies). All her stories seem to involve the same people placed in slightly variant situations, and her words, 'planted and re-planted for too long' in the same soil of culturally confused, educated Bengalis, fail to flourish.     Overall, it's not something I'd recommend to fans of earlier works by her.If you want to read a good Jhumpa Lahiri- try the first collection of short stories -Nothing else she's written so far come close to it.

B00005JPUN|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I have always enjoyed good science fiction storytelling.  That being said, this wasn't the best body snatchers remake ever...that Donald Sutherland sounding the alarm still gives me the creeps.  I didn't compare it to those movies.  Just took it for itself.    I thought it was fun and suspenseful, and it had a more hopeful ending than the others.   One of the main characters being taken over toward the end was of course predictable, but so what?  I thought it was fun.    I didn't understand how if every one was of \\"one mind\\" the main characters could so easily escape going onto another street and simply walking?  Weren't the other people on the street of \\"one mind\\" as well.  I also could have done without the vomiting.    Enjoyable.
0316010669|3.0|\\"I believe . . . there can be as much value in the blink of an eye as in months of rational analysis\\".  Gladwell promises to show the reader that quick decisions can be \\"every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately\\", when we can and can't trust such snap judgments, and how they can be \\"educated and controlled\\".  He fails. Entertainingly and informatively, but he still fails.    Blink analyzes decision making in everyday life, sport, crime, war, and emergencies of various kinds.  Each individual case study is presented admirably, showing how experts make their decisions in that particular field.  The problem is that the lessons are usually not transferable.  What can we learn from the following?    -An art historian, with one glace, identifies as fake a statue that months of scientific tests had pronounced genuine.  She can't say exactly why.  It just doesn't look right.    -A decision tree based on a few simple questions gives better results than the expert clinical judgment of doctors in an emergency room.  The tree is derived from extensive statistical analysis.    -Psychologists can make good predictions about the durability of a relationship (not perfect, but much better than chance) after watching a couple interact for only a few minutes.  They do this by watching for signs they have picked up by watching hundreds of hours of slow motion videotape of other couples.    -Professional tennis and baseball players believe in and teach techniques that they do not use in practice (\\"roll the wrist\\" and \\"watch the ball onto the bat\\" - the former causes injury and the latter is physically impossible!).    -People who believe themselves unprejudiced reveal unconscious bias (with regard to race, sex etc) in word association tests and auditions.    All of the brilliant \\"blink of an eye\\" decisions are grounded on knowledge of many previous decisions and their outcomes.  (With a formal decision rule, the decision maker need not possess the knowledge personally, but it is guiding their actions all the same.)  It seems an almost inescapable corollary that there is no generalised skill called \\"good judgment\\".  One heart attack or statue is enough like another to permit useful generalisation, but heart attacks and statues are different enough that the rules for one are useless for the other.  Sometimes decisions are made quickly because they have to be, and sometimes because there is no gain from waiting for more information or analysis.  Sometimes the logic of the decision can explained rationally to a non-expert, and sometimes it can't.  Expertise can come from formal training, or years of practical experience, or just following the instructions, dummy.  And prejudice based on irrelevant information can bias even the most expert.      (Scene: foot of bodhi tree.  The Author, sitting in great serenity, is approached by a worshipful Reader.)    Reader: So, Mr. Gladwell, can I learn to make quick, accurate judgments?    Author: Of course.  Just make sure that you consider all relevant information (but not irrelevant information, which might cause prejudice), and take as much time as you need (but no longer).      Reader: How do you know which information is relevant and how long is long enough?      Author: Well . . . you just know!  You are an expert.    Reader: But I'm not an expert.  That's why I bought the book!  [Reviewer's confession: I actually borrowed it from the library.]    Author: Well, in that case I suggest you work and study hard for many years, and then you will be an expert.    Reader: In decision making?    Author:  No, just in whatever subject you spent years studying.    This is just how the world is, so it might seem unfair to blame Gladwell.  But the whole book is explicitly about \\"the power of thinking without thinking\\", one might say intuition for short.  The promise was insight into decision making in general, not just about the authenticity of art or heart attack treatment.  An impossible promise,maybe, but all the more reason it should not have been made.
1416914285|1.0|Let me just start by telling you that this is the first time EVER I will be getting my money back. I am the type that figures if you bought it then you stick it out. However, I hadn't come across such a horrible read as this one in such a long time I think I deserve my money back.<br /><br />How bad was it? I felt I was in a very, very bad episode of Buffy [from back in Season 1 when everything was so campy and horrid you couldn't help but wince].<br /><br />Mind you and I am a HUGE Buffy fan.<br /><br />Oddly enough what I find most disappointing was not the book itself but the fact that one of my absolute favorite YA writers recommended it. I don't know what Holly Black was thinking. In fact, I am willing to bet she didn't even have time to read the book and just read the description, saw faeries and figured it had to be good.<br /><br />I bought the book because she spoke so highly about it. I have never done this. Ever. I don't buy books because of author quotes. EVER. But Holly Black is so amazing with her dark faeries and I figured what the hell.<br /><br />I am never, ever doing that again.<br /><br />Let's see, where to begin. Oh yes. We have a seemingly normal teenager walking into a club. Somehow I get the idea she isn't of the \\"in\\" crowd and her and her friend probably stick out like a sore thumb but what the hell I'm going with it. Out of the blue [remember she is supposed to be normal] she sees a boy following a girl and figures they are about to get it on but what bothers her is that they are being followed by two more boys. Now, anyone else would have A)figured they were all friends or whatnot and B)minded their own business. But not our heroine. She thinks this is weird and so she proceeds to follow them all into the storage closet.<br /><br />Now, how big this storage closet is that there are 3 boys, 2 girls AND that the first four fail to notice our heroine hiding in the darkness, well, I don't know. Also, they are all super humans or not human and they can track each other yet they fail to detect a mere mortal hiding a few paces from where they are all standing.<br /><br />It just gets better and better.<br /><br />Of course our heroine mistakes the scene for a gang rivalry and figures they are going to kill the one boy they all followed. Instead of going to get help what does our heroine do? You probably saw this coming: she yells at them to stop what they are doing because killing humans is just plain wrong.<br /><br />I didn't make that up. I paraphrased. No joke.<br /><br />Oh, I think I forgot to mention that, before she decided to speak up, she was pretty scared thinking that these were not your average weirdos what with their talk of demons and supernatural beings.<br /><br />Raise your hand if you would have run back the way you came.<br /><br />Raise your hand if you would have gotten an adult, like one of the bouncers, to help.<br /><br />Raise your hand if you wouldn't have even follow the lot of them into a storage closet because it was none of your damn business.<br /><br />Since I couldn't believe my eyes I decided to check out some reviews on Amazon and, apparently, I should have checked them out first. It seems I wasn't mistaking and this book is a cross between every fantasy novel that ever was from Buffy to Harry Potter to Star Wars to god-knows what else.<br /><br />I could have tried to read some more but not only was the plot horrific, so was the writing. This was somebody's fan fiction gone wrong.<br /><br />I would have overlooked all of this if indeed it WAS someone's fan fiction but a professional book that cost no less than $18 USD?<br /><br />Oh you bet I will be getting my money back. And if they ask me why at the bookstore I am not even going to lie. I am going to tell them that it just plain stinks.e mortal hiding a few paces from where they are all standing.

B00006AW2M|5.0|With the soundscapes of Brian Jones, the Rolling Stones have never sounded more adventuresome before or after, with a definitive Eastern flavor & African-inspired rhythms.<br /><br />Released in December 1967, this is definitely the crowing achievement for Brian Jones, as his brilliant vision included performances on percussion, concert harp, organ, Mellotron and electric dulcimer & recorder.<br /><br />Delving past the three bona fide classic cuts - Citadel, She's a Rainbow and 2000 Light Years from Home - there are a trio of numbers which nip at their heels - Sing This All Together (See What Happens), Gomper and The Lantern.<br /><br />With a strings arrangement by John Paul Jones & backing vocals - on Sing This All Together (See What Happens) - by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, the album is a nod to the star power which was pushing pop culture to new heights, along with the studio wizardry that could be accomplished due to this celebrity status.<br /><br />A vastly underrated gem, the original release included three-dimensional picture of the band, which seems to sum up this very briefly traveled  artistic avenue that quickly faded once the demons of the times engulfed Brian Jones.
B0000691TJ|5.0|The Ramones best post-70s effort. The first five tracks [three of which were live show standards] are as good as anything they've ever done. The next four tracks are a notch below, but still strong. If the disk stopped there, I'd rate it five stars. However, the last four tracks are a let down and detract from the whole. Track 12, Endless Vacation, shows up on many of the Ramones compilations, but I can't listen to it. The bonus material is pretty generous, consisting of 12 cuts. Four are songs not appearing on the original disk - justifiably so; nuff said. The other 8 are demos and alternate versions of songs on the original disk and are a valuable addition. The demo of Howling at the Moon is exceptionally good - IMO much better than the original. The other demos and alternate takes are sufficiently different than the originals to be genuinely interesting. The bonus materials more than make up for the less than stellar last 4 tracks of the original and restore a 5 star rating. Too tough Too Die is a pretty strong album overall [a notch below the Ramones first 4 albums] on its own; with the bonus material it is a must have.
B0000039PW|5.0|This is the best album of all time. Every single track on this album is sick, and the single \\"Juicy\\", in my opinion, is one of the weaker songs.     Anthems like \\"Machine Gun Funk\\" and \\"Everyday Struggle\\" juxtapose with confessionals like \\"Things Done Changed\\" and \\"Suicidal Thoughts\\", making this album versatile in every way.    Things done changed... rap music has waned since the death of Biggie Smalls. However, nobody was more ready for their fate than Biggie. This album stands as a defining monument in rap music history, and Biggies contribution will not be forgotten any time soon.
1577314808|5.0|This was the best book ever, to create a new way of thinking and to help you change your life toward the positive. I also have read the New Earth and took the online course and together they are a wonderful way of putting a new slant on life that at 62 I had never thought of before. I am now staying in the NOW, and it feels so good to let go of all the past garbage, and not to worry about the future that is not here yet. Thank you Eckhart Tolle for this refreshing new look at life.

I understand he is getting paid by them, but hey.. i paid for the book, not for the Nikon ad.    Other than that.. Its a good book, full of stories and decent imagery (well few shots are horrible to me taste, but its just me), and tips.     Again - its not a cookbook. But its feeding your brain enough to start properlling ;) I would read it again and again, i believe, and recommend it highly to me friends (specially Nikon users.. arf)

B000UBMUN4|5.0|Don't get me wrong. I attended 3 readings by Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky at Harvard Square, Cambridge, Massachusettes in the late 1970's and even recorded \\"Contest of the Bards\\" and handed him a copy of it at his request,... I 'absolutely' consider his oratory style of delivery and poetic verse and style amazing and brilliant and so very very entertaining and inspiring.. but the 'greatest' epic poem or poet of his century I just can't agree with. Gary Snyder made such an impact with introducing the marriage of Zen and the Orient into modern poetry style of his day (as Vincent vanGogh and Gauguin did in painting in the Expressionest era in painting/art), and Gary's poems of the passing of a day's events are so brilliant and open and revealing, and Jack Kerouac's style and impact, and Ferlinghetti's brilliance stemming from such a variety of different drugs... T.S. Eliot, Walt Whitman, Patty Smith, Bob Dylan, ... Marianne Moore,... grins... there are so many just 'great' poets from that and before and after generations in American history... one can really not call one the 'greatest' of any of their peers when there is such an overabundance of wealth to choose from and to have been entertained and inspired by. Howl is about the 'awakening' of american society, the public, the 'beginning' of awakening that could happen. But we actually have reverted, we actually believe that it was 'only' Russians or Chinese or Cubans or the Germans of WWII who were lied to or not told the truths by their governments whether led by Political Action Groups, Special Interest, drug companies, oil companies, insurance companies, etc. The rending of the veil of sleepiness of being 'content' socially is what Howl is all about, the 'rage' against that as we should be enraged against the last moment of breath to deaths' face as deat come to take us to the next realm. I don't know if anybody actually feels the rage of \\"Howl\\" within anymore, whether it was worth it after all, after all ofthe tea and ices... shrugs.

The death of the animal awakens Christopher's desire to investigate and solve the dog's hideous murder.   Christopher's detective work drums up some interesting leads, not only about the dog, but also about some mysteries in Christopher's own life.  In the end, Christopher will have to choose between the family he knows and his need for knowing the truth about the incident of the dog in the night-time.   Mark Haddon's portrait of an autistic boy on a mission is well written, and perfectly told.  The story, composed as a first-person narrative, expertly portrays the actions and mind set of a person living with autism.   Haddon's complex storytelling may confuse some readers, but it is essential to building the foundation of Christopher's character.  It helps the reader to understand the thought patterns autistic people.  Haddon does a wonderful job weaving the chapters to create a compelling and surprising read.

B000XTLUW0|2.0|A review of the DVD.<br /><br />If you enjoy blurry shots, half second shots and many, many, (oh so many) audience shots - this is the concert for you.<br /><br />The people at this concert did not pay to see the other people at this concert so why would anyone buying this DVD do so either. Not since Queen's 'Rock In Rio' have I seen a director (actually two directors here) so obsessed with getting as many audience members on the screen. Who wants to see someone in the audience sing along to the song that's being played?! No one. Point the camera at the stage!!<br /><br />Muse are a great band and I love their music but, as with the DVD that came with 'Black Holes And Revelations', their live show has yet to be done justice when committed to film. The filming here has all the same problems as their Glastonbury set with some extras thrown in.<br /><br />What exactly is to be gained by a series of half second shots in rapid succession? Why waste time on 'artsy' (and I'm being very generous), blurry shots? When the camera people were previously employed filming N.Y.P.D. Blue and can't stand up straight, does this help us see what's going on? The beauty of a concert DVD is that you get to see a show you may have missed or get a better view of it if you were there.<br /><br />U2's 'Zoo TV', Talking Heads' 'Stop Making Sense' and Depeche Mode's 'Devotional' - great concerts with a lot going on, beautifully filmed and without the need for camera tricks. The performances were enough in themselves. Where do directors get the ego to think they can improve on a band's efforts?<br /><br />If the pace of filming on the slower songs had been applied to the whole concert, this would have been a great DVD. Instead the two directors and their wacky camera crew seem panicked at the thought of missing anything and as a result miss almost everything - apart from the audience of course.<br /><br />I noticed in the credits that there was a Stedicam operator - I guess none of his shots made it to the final cut.de it to the final cut.
6305718954|4.0|Somewhat panned by \\"professional\\" reviewers-- I just as soon as take the advice of those doing reviews here. Interesting story and well acted. The overflowed bathtub scences proved to be annoying and unrealistic-  note the tub location and the fact it is always overflowed. Poor reality here is one of the few flaws in this movie
014100018X|4.0|Looking for an easy read, I picked up Chocolat at a nearby bookstore.  I expected something simple and enjoyable, and that's exactly what I got; no more, no less.  This book is by no means a literary classic; I cannot imagine readers many years from now picking it up with reverence, regarding it as the epitome of anything remarkable.   Furthermore, I didn't experience any epiphanies or deep changes in my personal beliefs as a result of reading it.  But honestly, that was exactly what I wanted.  Joanne Harris has an undemanding writing style where the reader isn't expected to read too deeply into the text.   I would recommend it as a fantastic summer book.  Set in a small village in France where chocolate shops are an unnecessary luxury, the book has a rather romantic, fantasy feel to it.  Magic is referenced to lightly, as an ingredient to the wonderfully described confections served up by Vianne.  This ties in well with the sweet, rather fairy-tale like ending in which many of the loose ends created by the small town characters are tied up nicely as all those deserving reach their own personal happiness.  It's a good escape from boring reality, and as pleasant as the confection after which it is named.

B000YAA68C|4.0|I'll start off by saying I do not enjoy melodrama or Hilary Swank in particular very much.  So, I was surprised twice by this movie, which I've watched several times with my wife.    The story focuses on Holly (Swank) as she is trying to move past her loss but is still receiving reminders of him that he had arranged to send her before his death from a tumor.  We don't see much of Gerry (Butler) while alive, but we do see him through Holly's memories and in her imagination here and there.  In the course of the movie Holly does come to terms with her loss though it never really resolves if the after-death reminders from him were a help or not.  In the end, you get the impression that they did help her, but in watching the film you can see that there is obvious pain resurrected in her each time she is confronted with them and the places they lead her.    As the lead, Hilary Swank completely delivers as Holly.  I found myself laughing and grieving with her and she brings real substance and emotion to the character of Holly.  Gerry isn't present as much, but Gerard Butler gives a solid performance as the sometimes cocky and over-sure Gerry but gives the character charm and sweetness to.  Some of the moments of chemistry between the two were some of the best I've seen in film in a while.  I don't know how they work together when the cameras weren't rolling but they delivered a solid image of your typical married couple here.    The supporting characters run the usual gambit of good and bad.  Sometimes necessary to further the plot or breath new life to the story and at other times out of place and jarring with the theme of the story.  I found a few moments where the humor they deliver is hard to take in after the sad tension of the previous scene.  However, the casting was well done with many likable actors.    P.S. I Love You ends as you would expect it to and does a fairly good job at resolving Holly and giving her a chance at future happiness.  Although, there is a sadness to the film as well, as the impression you have of Holly and Gerry together is hard to move beyond.  If you have parallels to this scenario in your own lives then I imagine this to be quite touching - for good and bad.    Ultimately, I have to recommend the film despite my previous acknowledgment that romantic drama stuff usually isn't my game.  If your girl is in for a sappy flick then you could do worse than P.S. I Love You.
B0011UBDTK|3.0|Like others I purchased the cheaper option between the $196 and $109 listings. I just received the item and although I haven't opened it yet, it looks exactly like my friend's 2005 version (faux velvet cover, spiral book, discs, etc.) and the label mentions 20 discs. However I wanted the new 21 disc release with movie coupon. Amazon's going to try and ship out another item incase the old one was sent by mistake. We'll see. At any rate, this one is cheaper than the other listing.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|I really can't say enough about how much I enjoy this show ... It's so much more than just two utterly hot men (and let's be clear - they are utterly hot...But don't worry - there are plenty of utterly hot gals to keep everyone else happy)running around ridding the earth of demonic baddies. There is a refreshing supply of hilarious dialog (the funniest lines delivered pitch-perfectly by Jensen Ackles)to offset the truly-scary moments .. not to mention delicately written and performed moments of human vulnerability and intimacy.  What a combo!  And the best part is - They have maintained this balancing act since the first episode of Season One - all the way through Season Two.    If you enjoy the supernatural genre at all, you will LOVE this show!
1577314808|5.0|This book is an example of how we need to be told over and over and over again the same thing before we actually make a change and implement it into  our lives.

A profound and thought-provoking offering.
B000002L9W|3.0|Really around 3.5 stars for this full length DLR debut. And it kicks with a clean production with old mate Ted Templeman taking care of the knob job. And with a backing band of Steve Vai, Billy Sheehan and Greg Bissonette ol' Diamond Dave isn't stinting on the quality in any department. Let's face it people must of been falling over themselves to work with the guy back in 1986.<br /><br />Not high art this but with the stable of hot musicians at his back Dave proves himself quite the circus ring master with great rock-down-the-highway tracks like Yankee Rose and Shyboy backed up by ridiculous jazz infused tracks like I'm Easy and mellow cuts like Tobacco Road and these other directions were unexplorable within the more pedal to the metal Van Halen. And while personally they aren't much fun or worth repeated listens for other fans they are probably the most interesting.<br /><br />A fine blend of rockin' out and more fun oriented tunes but strangely not a disc that demands frequent visits to my stereo as it feels like a bit too much of a novelty, too many whimsical moves tried on one disc. Too many laughs and not enough swinging of the lead.

There is an incredible amount of variety for you to choose from. It reminds me how I used to get excited about a new album. I must admit there are one or two songs that I don't love (Mr. Music would be generic if someone else did it) but it might grow on me. I love Be Myself Again, Fame, Stamp Your Feet, and Science of Love. I love that Donna would do a song like Slide Over Backwards which proves she would have been a great actress. I hope this cd brings back attention to a very talented and creative performer who is so much more than a disco diva (but, then, who ever did that better)? This will be playing in my car all summer.
B00003CXCW|4.0|I've heard so much about this classic film and I really don't know why it's taken me this long to watch it.  Gloria Swanson is my new idol.  She absolutely owned every scene she was in.  The fact that this film still hold true to this day is a testament to the genius that was Billy Wilder.  Great script, wonderful, wonderful acting and direction.  Today we watch fading stars of the past, try to cling on to an audience-any audience by means of reality television-all still ready for their close-ups.  Brilliant film.

Suprised the man could perform an up-tempo tune without missing a beat.  Some great pop/classical music.<br /><br />I subtract a star,  not for the muisc,  but for the DVD.  I just couldn't get \\"into\\" his live performances.<br /><br />The music is what counts,  and not much is missing here.
B0010X745K|5.0|I watched The Mist alone, and I'm not ashamed to admit that on two occasions, as characters walked through that menacing white mist, I had to fast forward. Yes, I used the slowest FF speed possible, so I could still see that was happening, but the suspense was too much and the sounds were too creepy to watch it at normal pace.<br /><br />Stephen King's novella upon which this movie was based was brilliant. King excels at taking ordinary people, humanizing their characters by giving them traits and habits we can all relate to, and then putting them into the most extraordinary situations.<br /><br />That's what The Mist does. You can't help but wonder \\"what I would I do in that situation?\\" and, even though I was watching alone, on a few occasions I found myself shouting at the screen \\"turn off the lights!\\" \\"get the bug spray!\\" \\"look behind you!\\"<br /><br />In Alfred Hitchcock's classic The Birds, the scariest scenes involve the characters trapped in a house that is under the siege of thousands of winged attackers. You don't see much, only the terrified faces of the characters. But the sounds! Wings flapping, high pitched bird calls, feathered bodies thumping against the walls and windows - it's one of the scariest scenes on film.<br /><br />The Mist is full of scenes like this, and the tension is kept high for most of the movie's running time.<br /><br />But The Mist is about more than monsters - its a study of how a society under stress falls apart into Lord Of The Flies-like anarchy and primitivism. Here, the movie is less successful. There's a little too much preaching and long stretches of dialog where the the characters discuss and debate what's going on. It's a little heavy handed. We would have understood the conflicts without them being explained to us.<br /><br />It also happens really fast - I think the movie spans two and a half days, by the end of which most of the survivors are willing to offer up human sacrifices to the monsters in the mist. I get what the director was going for, I just wish a strong editor would stepped in to leave a little more to our imagination.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good. I see on other reviews here that some people found Marcia Gay Harden a little  much, but I thought she was brilliant in a role that called for an over-the-top performance. She is, in general, a very accomplished actress, and I actually think she got a lot across with subtlety in this role. Even when she's standing there quietly, there's always something happening in her scheming, panicked eyes. The role is a caricature, but she brings real intelligence and commitment to it. I honestly believe that had she given this performance in a non-genre film, she would have been an Oscar contender<br /><br />My major complaint about the movie, though, is the ending. STOP READING NOW if you want to know nothing about how this film ends.<br /><br />Even with that disclaimer, I won't be too specific. I'll just say I thought the ending was needlessly cruel and emotionally sadistic. Just about the worst thing that you can imagine happens. It was clever, but it felt like a cheat. It seemed a betrayal of what happened before, and it made you feel as if the director (who also wrote the screenplay,and who changed the ending of the King story) really hated his characters, which I didn't understand.<br /><br />When the movie was over, I immediately hopped over to the \\"extras\\" menu, hoping to find an alternate ending that wasn't so mean-spirited. Unfortunately, there wasn't one, and I'm left with a bitter end to what had been a genuinely thrilling film.<br /><br />I'll still give The Mist four stars for how truly scary it was and for great effects and truly horrific creature designs. Maybe less sensitive souls will appreciate the fact that there is no stereotypically \\"happy\\" ending. But boy, did it have to be THIS brutal?<br /><br />What was up till then an entertainingly thrilling joyride became a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions, where the human horror far exceeded that generated by the monsters. I suppose it's a commentary on something, but I'm not sure what. I just know that by seeking to increase the profundity of the ending, and by being so horribly cruel to characters we'd come to know and like, The Mist blew its smoke in the wrong direction.entary on something, but I'm not sure what.

B00005JPNZ|2.0|With all the interest, talent, money and track record it is nothing short of a huge disappointment to me that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull manages to irritate, bore and overkill in as much as it thrice thrilled, charmed and energized.   I'll only say that it seems to have fallen into the recent Star Wars trap of pumping in technology and cg effects at a constant clip, oddly at the expense of story and character. Consider that this fits more with the National Treasure, Mummy or Tomb Raider films than with the originals. Maybe I am getting old, and having recently watched the first three Indianas I was struck by this installment's excessive scope, lost humor, trying suspensions of my disbelief (a refrigerator through the air? That whole jungle chase!) and partial historical components.   The originals were more intimate despite having global implications, and beautifully balanced action pieces with charged, humorous, warm scenes of comraderie, romance or family.   Maybe this will signal the end of pushing the once successful franchise back out for another round of pub and profit (Die Hard 4, Rocky 6, Terminator 3, Alien/Predator, Rambo 4, etc.), calling into question the good fortune of a series' reputation and the essential significance of movie lovers affections for the films of their youth.
B00125WAWS|5.0|This is an outstanding and very moving film about a fascinating slice of our country's racial history -- beautifully written and superbly acted, with a good soundtrack too.  The debate format allows the story to seamlessly integrate the social and political context into the plot.  Although it does have a strong message, the story is, for the most part, allowed to unfold through the differing viewpoints of the youthful protagonists, saving it from being excessively plodding or preachy.  The dialogue occasionally flirts with cliche and Hollywood schmaltz, but this is a minor quibble with an incredibly impressive accomplishment.  Highly recommended!

1423101464|5.0|Percy Jackson is difficult to deal with from a parental perspective. Of course, one issue is that he is a teenager.  Another is the fact that he is a half blood thanks to being the son of the sea god, Poseidon.  Then, there is that whole blowing up the school issue which happens on a fairly regular basis.<br /><br />The last is what he is pretty much known for but he doesn't want to destroy schools. He doesn't wake up and plan to destroy a school. It just happens. With Percy's planned attendance at an orientation at Goode High School on East 81st in New York City as the novel opens, mother and son are both a bit worried.  There is extra pressure this time because mom's boyfriend, Paul Blofis pulled strings from his position as English teacher to get Percy accepted to Goode High School where he will begin the ninth grade in the fall despite Percy's history of being kicked out of every school he has ever attended. The plan is to attend the orientation, get out before anything happens, and go spend the summer at the Half Blood Camp. Everything would have been fine too except for one small problem.<br /><br />Demonic cheerleaders.<br /><br />The two cheerleaders wanted Percy dead in the worst way and didn't care what happened to the mortals that got in their way or the building itself.  When all is said and done, Percy is on the run again headed for the Half Blood Camp. Not only will he have to clear his name yet again, but this time is going to have to go into the Labyrinth to delay Kronos who is building his army to take over the world and the modern day Mount Olympus.<br /><br />This latest installment in the series is another action filled, often funny, read for both teenagers and adults.  Greek mythology is again brought to noisy life by author Rick Riordan who draws parallels and links between the ancient myths and the modern world. While telling a great story, he continues to frequently satire various matters involving politics and education. Parents in Texas especially will appreciate the hilarious section involving the sphinx, the revised policy on the riddle, and TAKS as well as the No Child Left Behind Act. It's simply \\"exemplary\\" writing to be enjoyed and should be posted in every classroom across the state.<br /><br />As he has done so well before, author Rick Riordan (who also authored the very good Tress Navarre mystery series) has penned another installment that while good in its own right is a small cog in the series arc detailing the coming epic battle with Kronos.  Character development is secondary as the characters have been well established by this point. Instead, the focus is action. Therefore, the ongoing issue of Percy's prophecy is briefly touched on to remind readers with the main focus being the here and now as the battle of Labyrinth is a minor skirmish in the build up to the Great War. The war is coming and is should really be something.<br /><br />Kevin R.

0380730367|5.0|Dennis Lehane deserves all the praise he receives.  He is truly a master writer and story teller.  He always delivers a well-written, strongly plotted and entertaining story.  Prayers for Rain ranks up there with Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River.  This book is dark, gruesome, violent and riveting.  It's well paced and Lehane provides a number of twists and turns, as usual.  Nothing, however, comes out of left field.  Everything makes sense once investigator Patrick Kenzie and his partner Angela Gennaro answer the dangling questions. You'll race through this book.
B000P7V46C|3.0|This original 1978 release was full of dramatic keyboard sequences & drum fills that have been muted in the 2007 nick davis remaster.  My guess is that in order to obtain a new generation of genesis fans he dulled down the aggressive phil collins drumming & intricate tony banks keyboard patterns because it doesn't suit the popular mood of today.  These days a great band is plagued by straight 4/4 rhythm patterns driven by drummers with 5 piece drum kits with no talent.  This album (when originally released) was a perfect duet of commercial rock & intelligent progressive rock (now considered too busy).  This is the best \\"collins era\\" genesis album as collins is developing his voice & drum chops.  The band as a whole was constantly evolving using new sounds (especially here with tony's yamaha cp-70 electric piano).  This reproduction does the band diservice by trying to mask what made the band huge - their intricate progressive style.  The video extras were cool though.  3 dates with genesiswas a TV special of their 1978 tour & shows their computer controlled mirrors & lasers (groundbreaking at the time).  By this but young kids be aware & buy the original master too.

Cate Blanchett (best actress in the world) is great as well.  It is totally worth a trip to the theater, and I rarely feel that way.

B000056HE9|5.0|What a pity it is that films such as this are virtually unthinkable in contemporary culture.  Explicitly Christian but not preachy or sectarian, it offers a universal message as appropriate at Christmas as any other time.  The galaxy of stars (Young, Grant, Niven) and excellent supporting cast are used to great advantage.  Goldwyn had thought of Niven in what became the Grant role, but Grant wisely persuaded him to cast it in its present form.  'Heartwarming' is the word that most quickly comes to mind, something that is just as necessary today as it was in 1947.  The Bishop's Wife is a romantic comedy without sex, a reflection on wealth and religion without anger or bitterness and a reflection on essential human good without soppy sentimentality.  It is hopeful without being doctrinaire and sweet without being saccharine.  We would not want a current array of films that only included works such as this, but it would be nice to have a few from time to time.  If you have not seen it, do so.  It will lift your spirits.

B00005LQ04|3.0|Seeing as over 30 years have passed between the initial release of Suspiria and today, it is awful hard for me to say what effect it would have had on me had I been alive to see it when it first hit theaters. Maybe at the time it would have been different, but after watching it for the first time today, well...sorry, but I don't see what the fuss is all about.     All right, I can see how the blatant employment of what appears to be well-hidden red, blue and yellow 30-watt bulbs may have been experimental for its time. And the score does a fair job of creating mood. The problem is that these things come across as transparent and lazy attempts to sift some actual artistic merit out of the bland, unsatisfying stew of a plot. The story here is so weak that it seems a mere afterthought to the visuals. As though Dario Argento just needed some crap for people to say for a few minutes in between drawn-out camera shots awash in primary colors. The dance academy is actually a witches' coven. Really, now? I understand the point must have been to create scenes evocative of nightmares, but much of it seems forced. No matter a movie's alleged contributions to the form artistically, if the story sucks then I just can't give it too much credit. It seems to me that Argento might have been better off not bothering with a plot, let alone one this paper-thin, and just gone with a surreal collage of images and sounds. That would have lent it a more \\"hallucionatory\\" feel anyway, which seems to be his primary concern. Since it would take up too much space for me to go into detail about all the weak spots in plot and dialogue, I'll sum it all up with: \\"If I count their steps, I can figure out where they're going.\\" By the time Suzy solves the \\"mystery\\", I'm still trying to solve the one about why I should care.    Just as awkwardly forced into the proceedings is the score. For the first few minutes of what I take to be the de facto theme song of the movie, I was pretty impressed. A hauntingly simple minor-key melody that descends and returns, its unrelenting repetitiveness building almost unbearable tension, the apprehension of what horrifying event is just moments from taking place, and...boom. Nothing. Scene change. The music stops so abruptly that it sounds like someone hit the pause button. This happens many times throughout the movie. I would estimate that song to be playing over around 1/3 of the 98 minute duration. Maybe more. Sometimes it does lead to a horrific scene, but most times it seems to be abused in a cheap attempt to build suspense that the plot can't supply. And then nothing will happen. I've read a bit about the supposed brilliance of the score to this movie in its creating an underlying sense of unease and tension. For the early part of the film, I would have agreed. But not long into it, the tension and unease come not from genuine craft of fear, but rather from tedium and ear fatigue. A movie like this should put you on edge, and it does; it just does it in the wrong way, and the overall effect is for me to want to stop watching. Not because I'm scared in any way, but simply because it is almost too monotonous to bear.    So there it is. Perhaps on repeated viewings I will change my tune on this one, but I somehow doubt it. I give it 3 stars instead of the 2 I think it deserves right now due to its evident status as an artisitic landmark in the horror genre, but I just can't be impressed by this. Don't get me wrong, there were some things done well. Argento often succeeds in his attempt to create trippy visual atmospheres, and I can't deny that I was provoked to cries of \\"oh, god!\\" during the girl's dive into the razorwire pool (I found this scene much harder to watch than the first, and far more talked about, murder scene), but overall the movie was funny at best, and excruciatingly boring at worst. Seems to me like one of those ones people claim to \\"appreciate\\" because they want to sound intellectual, or maybe I just don't get it. Either way, it seems like a classic case of style over substance to me.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|This is a great movie. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. If you like \\"thinking\\" movies this is for you. It's a cerebral movie that requires you to follow every second to keep up.  Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt are Fantastic!!!!!
B00006EXL5|5.0|I bought this album when it came out in 2002, andI'm still jammin to every song like I did when I first played it. It's a great album, and I sometimes prefer this album to the other two that the band has made. All of the songs are great to listen to over and over again. I have recommended it to many of my friends who are just as obbsessed as I am, and we all agree on one thing...<br /><br />It's frikkin AWESOME!!!
B000002ILG|5.0|This is the sophomore release by White Lion in 1987 and came on the heals of success by Poison, Motley Crue, Bon Jovi and Van Halen.  Catchy riffs and great lyrics, good vocals and melodic work help to make this a rather enjoyable work even against today's rock music. Vitto's guitar is stunning!<br /><br />This contains their major break-throughs and top 10 hit (Wait and When the Children Cry).  The latter is adorned as one of the best power ballads ever written.  In addition, Lady of the Valley and Tell Me are awesome releases as well.  Only a couple tracks otherwise werent top notch and thus the 4.5 rating instead of 5. Lady of the Valley is best in its studio form and needs to be heard here before hearing the various live versions.<br /><br />If anyone enjoys guitar music, this is a must own.  If you enjoy 80 metal music, this is a must own.  If you are a White Lion fan, you can not do without. Nothing they wrote before and after compares well to this album except maybe Little Fighter and the cover of Radar Love.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|I bought this album expecting it to be almost like MCR's first two hits, not realizing that they had grown since then. The songs, along with the copncept, are amazing, to say the least. I listen to this album all the time. Every song has a meaning that I can relate to, and I recommend this album to anyone who is looking for a band that won't let you down.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I must have gotten the deal of the century in April 08 as I picked these up for $79.95 from BSW through Amazon.  Currently the best price on Amazon is $125.  These headphones are still worth it at $125.<br /><br />I use these with a Ipod at work and wear them for 6+ hours a day.  I've come close to depleting the battery only a couple of times (it's a 30 GB gen 5.5 Ipod).  The bass and seperation sounds fantastic.  You can crank these up to full volume without distortion (though I don't play them that loud to save my hearing).  Most people in my department wear headphones and the most common comment when they put these on is \\"WOW\\".<br /><br />The long cord is good and bad.  It sometimes gets in the way, but not that big of a deal.<br /><br />The comfort is something.  They fit over the ears without pinching and as I stated above, they are worn for 6+ hours a day.<br /><br />These replace Sony MDR-D777LP headphones which I paid way too much for in a brick and mortar store.  These sound leaps and bounds better.  The Sony MDR-D777LP headphones only lasted about 9 months before breaking ( a very common occurance).

I hadn't checked up on them since they released thier first album in '02. The first song I heard from this album was 'I'm Not Okay (I Promise)', and right then I was sold. I bought the album, and listened to every song and fell in love with MCR all over again.<br /><br />A perfect purchase if you're looking for an album that has a lot of cursing, amazing riffs, and one hell of a frontman.
B000J103WK|5.0|This concert is outstanding. I also have a copy of the regular DVD and it is also outstanding. I have been an Eagle fan for years and I believe this DVD to be A must for anyone who enjoys the Eagles. I would put this in the top 5 videos out their. If you are like me who has never been to a concert of the Eagles, this is the closest thing to being there. Purchase a copy for yourself you will not regret it.
0743486285|5.0|Wow!!! I bought this book after hearing Life is Beautiful on the radio.  I've never been into drugs and I'm extremely thankful for that. However, I've known people who've suffered with these same issues, some made it and some didn't. I had ever opportunity to try the buffet but I chose not to. I knew by the time I was a teenager that I have an excessive personality; moderation is hard for me. I'm a chain smoker and that's enough for me.  Nikki Sixx has done a wonderful thing with this book, it shows others that there is and can be a light at the end of the tunnel. Addiction comes in many forms and until you recognize it you're held prisoner by your own fear. I applaud the honesty and strength it must have taken to share his personal hell with the world. A famous author said, about other famous authors, they didn't drink because they were writer's they drank because they were alcoholics. Addiction is what it is and nothing will change that. We can wish and hope that those out there who are struggling with their demons can read this memoir and find some solace. Even a wealthy rock star can fall on his face. You're not alone.  Bravo!!!  J Evans
B000RZGIOA|5.0|While I don't think this is a five star movie (probably a solid three or four) something has to be done to balance out the idiots who are posting lower ratings for this excellent film solely based on their dislike of Paramount (who has finally come over to blu like everyone else).<br /><br />So -- if you want this film, buy it on BD because it is available (it's actually already in stores but Amazon has a weird idea not to make it available until June 3).  It's a very good film, terrific action, and the pic quality and sound should be excellent (read the reviews of it on regular DVD to get a better idea).
B000YABYLA|5.0|absolutely looooove this movie! it's appropriate for so many different types of people and will make you laugh til you cry
0307265730|3.0|I was disappointed that this collection of what I see as novellas more than stories was (1) not designated as a collection on the bookjacket and (2) lacked the same literary voice as previous writing by Ms. Lahiri. The stories focused on the Bengali/American culture clash and family relationships in general, but lacked the elegant, flowing language of prior writings by this talented author. I hope this is merely a temporary lapse.  Many writers produce a book that falls short of the extraordinarily high bar set by the body of work which preceded it. I think that is the case here.  I remain a fan of Ms. Lahiri's cultural insights and sympathetic characterizations.
0446615625|1.0|I did think something was going to happen to overturn the pro-terrorist leanings of the book.  But it never happened, and I'm more than 1/2 way thru.  I'm done.  I will never finish this book.
B000EGF0QY|5.0|This book was great from start to finish--I don't usually find myself \\"laughing out loud\\" when I'm reading, but this book had me pretty close. David Sedaris continues to write with the same brutal honesty and dry wit that made \\"Naked\\" such a good read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys satire and doesn't get easily offended.
B000FS9MV0|3.0|The answer is yes if you like slow songs. This is a pretty good album, but not nearly as good as her debut. The problem, in my opinion, is there is too much \\"sap\\" and not enough \\"pizazz\\". Don't get me wrong, there are some \\"GREAT\\" songs on here, but where Renee really shines is on the fun stuff like THANKS FOR THE BOOGIE RIDE and AIN'T WE GO FUN and there just isn't enough of it! I think they could of substituted a few of the slower songs and had a better result. Renee also wrote a couple songs herself and while they are good songs in their own right, I don't think they fit with the rest of the album. Hold me now is my favorite of those. With that said, I recommend this album for songs like MIDNIGHT MAN, STARS FELL ON ALABAMA, SKYLARK and the 2 up-tempo songs mentioned above. But if this is your first album purchase for Renee, I recommend her previous album first. Either way, you will enjoy both, I know I do
B00005JPNZ|2.0|Look up \\"lost opportunity\\" in the dictionary and you'll see the one-sheet for this film. It lacks every quality for which the originals were so loved: plot, energy, pace, imagination, suspense, smart dialogue, surprising humour and spine-tingling moments of religious wonder. Such a heady mixture regularly had you grinning from ear to ear. This time around you'll be sitting there in slack-jawed wonderment at the lameness of it all. What the hell happened? A dire screenplay, for one thing, which seems cobbled together from several variants. Rather than setting up a simple goal as the driver for an array of action set-pieces, it seems content just to wander around aimlessly plundering the originals for references. Don't blame David Koepp. He's a reasonable writer, but here seems to have been hired as a typist. No, this cack-handed travesty has the stink of George Lucas all over it - the man who, let's face it, spent the last decade boring us senseless with the storyless downfall of that irritating sap, Anakin Skywalker. Where's Howard Hawks-devotee Lawrence Kasdan when you need him? What happened to the version Frank Darabont wrote? Surely it wasn't worse than this. Performances are fine, but they can't salvage it. Ford is grizzled but convincing because his age is acknowledged. Shia LaBeouf adds some cheek and youthful spark. Karen Allen's sass is tempered with girlish affection and the few snatches of dialogue Marion shares with Indy are among the film's best. Cate Blanchett might happily have brought her stagecraft to a ludicrous caricature, but she isn't given a chance to save the day. The screenplay forbids it. Overall, this is a tremendously disappointing film. Sure, expectations were high. But that's not unreasonable: when one of the world's best filmmakers revives one of the world's most loved series you expect he'll make an effort. None is in evidence here. This is the laziest film Spielberg has ever made.
0061537934|5.0|I found this book reviewed in People magazine and knew that I had to read it.  If you've ever wondered just what your dog is thinking, or thought that they are more aware than we generally give them credit for, this book is absolutely for you.  I've grown up around dogs and this book touched me in so many ways.  It's a story about a dog, but more about his master and the love that he has for him.  It's touching, insightful and downright wonderful.  I couldn't put it down!
0804115613|5.0|Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe is one of my all-time favorite novels.  I don't read very many books more than once.  Great Expectations, To Kill a Mockingbird, A Christmas Carol, The Grapes of Wrath get read and re-read, but the book has to be spectacular because there are so many books out there to read and time is limited.  Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe is one I read over and over.  In fact, the first time I read it, and this is the only book this has happened with, I was so reluctant for it to end that as soon as I finished the last page, I turned back to page one to start again.  It is THAT good.  Highly recommended!
B0017M413M|4.0|I thought the movie was just a long episode, with better music and a little profanity.  Plot was a typical Stargate episode, good guys find something, get captured, things look really bad, something happens and good guys win.  I was a little disappointed with the replicator twist.  It was worth the $4 I spent renting it here.
B00005JPNZ|5.0|This movie is exactly what it should have been. People kept talking about how cheesy the ending was, and all I could say was...duh! This series was designed that way it was supposed to be cheesy so anyone who complains about that must have not watched the other ones. It kept in line with the fake graphics which I thought was great. Bottom line if youre a fan of the series you wont be disappointed.
037571457X|4.0|Authentic childhood story.  The emotions ring true.  Brings back to life the tragedy of a great civilization torn apart, first by the Shah, and then by the Islamic madmen.
0307276902|5.0|I wrote a review years ago after I read this book.  Still today, regardless of all the notoriety, I give thanks to James for writing this book.  Unless someone has walked in the shoes of very early sobriety and recovery from drug addiction as well as alcohol abuse there can be no understanding of how powerful this book is.  Bottom line: it saved my life and my MIND.  Without this book God only knows if I would be here today 3 years later, clean and sober, to write about it.
0525948023|5.0|My partner and I both have found this information to be helpful in many ways, offering insights, that while not \\"new\\", are profound and worth exploring again and again. I recommend this book to everyone seeking self-knowledge and understanding. If the reader approaches this material with an open mind and heart, much can be gained.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|Look, I know that a LOT of people are saying the ending is Depressing. YES, it is. But it is still well written, acted and directed. And the main reason we go to the movies is to be AFFECTED, to laugh, to cry, to mourn...to be scared. And I applaud Frank Darabont who doesn't follow the \\"Hollywood Line\\", and give us a Disneyesque ending.<br /><br />Sure, the ending isn't all rainbows and lollipops. But, the movie is called \\"The Mist\\"...it's a HORROR/THRILLER movie.<br /><br />And for once I came out of a movie without having to say...\\"Well, that all worked out in the end..\\". If for nothing other than THAT, it was a great movie.<br /><br />But, it was so much more. Tense, dramatic and with the great \\"twist\\" ending. The Mist is an essential addition to the must watch classic horror thriller films of the past 70 years.<br /><br />Don't be put off by other peoples negativity, if you like tense thrillers, with a few scares, a little gore and some UNPREDICTABILITY...then see this film.
B000003CMB|5.0|The Allman Brothers were Duane Allman (slide guitar and lead guitar), Gregg Allman (vocals, organ), Dickey Betts (lead guitar, rhythm guitar, vocals), Berry Oakley (bass), Butch Trucks (drums) and Jai Johanny \\"Jaimoe\\" Johanson (drums).  The band was labeled as  \\"Southern Rock\\" , but being from Kentucky, it just sounded like good rock to me. This particular live recording from those southern gentlemen has to be one of the greatest concert albums of all time! The purity of guitars, the bluesy keyboards and the souful grit of Greg Allman's vocals are guaranteed to move anyone. I will always chersih an outdoor concert I attended once in Indiana where this excellent group headlined. They put on one hell of a show and played for what seemed forever. After the concert, we discovered all of the cars had been towed away by the landowner where everyone had parked. Hours and many miles later we were able to buy our car back from the local sheriff. It was morning by the time my friends and I got home but we really didn't mind the hassle because we felt we had witnessed history and were part of something that night jamming with the \\"Allman Brothers\\", one the best rock and roll bands the world has ever known! This album captures their live musical magic and should be on everyone's \\"desert island\\" list of must have CDs. - Ciao
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|Upon listening to the album and reading the lyrics alongside, I have realized that the Sufferer and the Witness is a fantastic album. An opinion not formed upon previous material, Siren Song the Counter Culture being the popular example, I found that Rise Against have created thirteen tracks all of which are great, the majority of them brilliant. The fast pace is one factor, though slower songs the Approaching Curve and Roadside come off to wonderful effect, the passion, the lyrics and the hardcore raw sound are all parts that make this album excellent. The range of topics on show complete the songs, from personal to political, the videos Ready to Fall and Prayer of the Refugee being prime examples and the aforementioned Approaching Curve.  Of course, it is important to compare an album off its predecessors, and it might pale in comparison but for any Rise Against newbies, I definitely suggest a listen, whilst the old fans, I hope you like it.  x
B00005JPNZ|3.0|***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br /><br />Although able to spark a significant [[ASIN:B0014Z4ONE Indiana Jones]] sense of nostalgia, and add a possible newcomer to the ranks of what might be future Indiana Jones films, there's not much else to Spielberg's latest adventure film ...except an ending that harkens back to the not-so-good [[ASIN:B00003CXXP Artificial Intelligence]] film.<br /><br />Understandably Spielberg was waiting for the perfect script, but Harrison Ford wasn't getting any younger, so it is my assumption that Spielberg took the leap and decided to direct a so-so film rather than let Ford's character forever fall into obscurity. The film itself isn't necessarily so-so, but the concept and ending are not, shall we say, in keeping with the Indiana Jones film mentality.<br /><br />Although I'm no Harrison Ford fan, I did enjoy his early work on such films as [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars]], [[ASIN:B000UBMWG4 Blade Runner]] and [[ASIN:078322737X American Graffiti]]. His later work became mundane and unexceptional, myself only being able to see Harrison Ford playing Harrison Ford and not the character(s) I was supposed to see. But the Indian Jones series was an entirely different ball-game. Funny. Action-packed. Historically ...strange. And just fun to watch. These are the things that make for entertaining cinema. And although this fourth installment in the Indiana Jones films carries many of those items, it does not carry it all the way to its newfound ending.<br /><br />And speaking of newfound, Shia LaBeouf ([[ASIN:B000KB489I A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints]]) as Mutt Williams, Indiana's spawn and possible successor, was a very good idea. He's cocky, strangely funny, and enough not like Indy to make the character believable. The sword fights on top of careening cars as they travel through the jungle and disrupt his testicular fortitude were just the right amount of zany action and ridiculous comedy that needed infusing into the story.<br /><br />Nostalgic-wise, the incorporation of Indiana and his love for his hat are immediately taken to heart as we witness him being ripped from the trunk of a car by communists, the main one being Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, [[ASIN:B000067DNF The Lord of the Rings]]), a sword-carrying and tough spy in the likes of actor Paul Freeman who played Rene Belloq in [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU The Raiders of the Lost Ark]]. Most Indy fans will also be very happy to see Karen Allen reprise her role as Marion, Indiana Jones' love interest from the first film. Although the years show heavily on Mrs. Allen, she's still spunky enough to give a fine performance.<br /><br />Lovers of the [[ASIN:B0016GLZW4 original score]] will also be happy how it was folded into this latest release, portions of the music being liberally sprinkled throughout the story. The filming used for Indiana Jones 4 did not use digital cameras, so the original style can also be seen and felt by the viewing audience.<br /><br />Where the story begins to crumble, however, is in the storyline that reuses old themes from the Raiders film (anyone who looks at or knows what they shouldn't is wiped off the planet), and adds Spielberg's heavy-handed sense of science fiction that helped destroy the end of the aforementioned Artificial Intelligence movie (\\"It's a portal to another realm!\\") The crystal skull(s) also just seemed like a key to a puzzle that easily could've been solved by anyone, not just the supposedly adept Jones (and his new prodigy). Which makes the \\"alien\\" ending seem all the more ludicrous.<br /><br />My assumption is that Hollywood and Spielberg himself think that audiences need something bigger, better, and more spectacular than the last. That's not necessarily true, especially when dealing with nostalgic cinema the likes of Indiana Jones. Audiences will come because they want that old timey feel, not something bigger, better, and more \\"alien\\" than before.<br /><br />Regardless of this film's failings, it is entertaining.The action is practically nonstop throughout its 124 minute length, making it seem shorter than it actually was. That's something, I guess.h, making it seem shorter than it actually was. That's something, I guess.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|This is a worthy sequel to the previous two films in this series.  Well done and well acted and the stunt scenes are fast moving and action packed.  They also even left open the possiblitie of a fourth film.
0743529030|4.0|For a book that is nearly 50 years old, the formula behind David J. Schwartz's \\"The Magic of Thinking Big\\" is great for any person who is struggling to get over the frustrations of being stuck in a rut and wanting to step up to the plate and take a chance.    Schwartz's words are not new. You can hear very similar themes from authors past and present, like Dale Carnegie, Brian Tracy, and Tony Robbins. But if the words aren't resonating from other authors, the delivery in \\"The Magic of Thinking Big\\" gives you simple and easy steps to follow to get you to think big things, and then do big things.
068817776X|3.0|While the focus of the story is how one woman survived the holocaust, the title sensationalizes a small part of the story (in fact, her husband wasn't a Nazi Officer until the German's were losing the war and drafting anyone left).       This is a book about one individual's survival, in large part due to some amazing luck and some good people.  It is NOT a book of how the author used her fortune or took extraordinary risks to help others.  Not that there's anything wrong about that.  It was a time where no one should be judged for doing what they had to do  to survive...and you have to admire anyone who did.  Its jut different than the books on the true heroes of this time. The kindness and the weak moments is the human norm and we see both extremes in many of the principle characters, including both of the men who loved the author was well. So its a different story and any documented history of this horrible time is one we should all remember.     Its not the best writing but it gets better and is easily readable. I wanted to give this 4 stars because any true story from this time is recommended reading; however its far from the best I've read. If you want to read an uplifting story about a woman who risks her luck to help others, I'd highly recommend \\"In My Hands\\" but Irena Opdyke.

The only reason I'm getting the album is, I've been a Bryan Adams fan since the song \\"Lonely Nights\\".  Have seen him in concert a couple of times.    I have been trying to rack my brain, but I only come up with 9 studio albums:  Bryan Adams  You Want It, You Got It  Cuts Like A Knife (in my opinion his best)  Reckless  Into The Fire  Waking Up The Neighbours  18 Till I Die  On A Day Like Today  Room Service  11    so that gives me a total count of 10.  What am I missing?  I don't consider his MTV Unplugged or Spirit soundtrack to be a BA studio album.  Please help me, thanks.

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|\\"Once\\" is the masterpiece of Nightwish while they still had Tarja.  What came after from the new Nightwish and Tarja solo is still excellent, but not that powerful and beautiful sound of when they were together.  This album has both speedy metal and slower songs, all driven by her voice and the synthesizer.  The genius is from Tuomas, the writer and synth player.  The songs that are haunting metal symphonic masterpieces are \\"The Siren\\" and \\"Ghost Love Score.\\"  This is the best of the best if you like a real soprano, symphonic scoring, and metal rock all in one.

B000002GQG|5.0|What better way to journey back to the fun and foolishness of Pyschedelia than with a talented troupe of young Brits? You might laugh at the faux oratorio format of \\"House of Four Walls\\" or the overindulgence in sitar throughout the album, but it's really more a matter of innocence than of pretense. And there are many moments of true beauty, rare in rock in any era, including \\"Voices in the Sky\\", and the joy of \\"Ride My Seesaw\\" is irresistible. Stuck as we are with the dreariness of much post-modern rock, it's nice to be reminded of the multi-instrumental virtuosity of Moody Blues arrangements, not all that far away from the colorful lushness of some operatic and classical music. And this is the kind of album meant to be listened to from beginning to end, pretty much conceived of as a suite. \\"You can fly\\", the guys intone, \\"High as a kite, if you want to/Faster than light, if you want to/Speeding through The Universe/Thinking is the best way to travel.\\" Thinking with your ears, that is, and in this day and at my age, it's a bit safer than mescaline.

0595440096|5.0|STill Alice is an intellectual and emotional journey into a disease that devastates too many in our society!  Through the eyes of Alice Howland and her family, Lisa Genova has created a sensitive, moving story of the physical, emotional and spiritual toll of Alzheimer's disease on both the victim and her loved ones.  She illustrates how frighteningly fast AD can rob a person of their own existence.  The harsh realities of being a victim of AD are apparent as Alice experiences an unimaginable  separation from her career and her family.  Lisa expertly ties in the struggles of Alice's family, and how their feelings and lives are affected to create a realistic picture of the heartache caused by this insidious process.  Furthermore, Lisa's extensive knowledge, research, and passion for finding treatments and a cure for this devastating disease are evident throughout the story.  The science behind AD (symptoms, diagnosis, treatments and current research) is apparent and creatively entertwined into the storyline to lend authenticity to the fears, hopes and dreams of Alice and her family.      This is an engaging, must-read that has the potential to clarify the AD experience for those who have been touched by it, as well as to promote an awareness as to how this crippling disease can affect our loved ones and society as a whole.      Those touched by Alzheimer's, as well as those interested in the disease stand to gain a great deal from reading this one!
0060853980|5.0|After reading \\"he Good Fairies of New York\\" I was desperate for a funny fantasy novel. Seeing as these are in short supply (as most fantasy books tend towards being epic, romantic or adventurous, some even scientific but very few funny) I found that \\"Good Omens\\" was one of the few recommended to me. So I went for it.    And I'm very glad I did. This novel reminded me quite a lot of \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" not only in the sense that both use footnotes (has to be a British thing right?) but also in the quality of sarcastic and non-obvious humor used in each. I found myself often laughing during the reading of this book. As I'm sure most readers would. Take a not so bad demon, an angel with no real interest in spending any time in heaven, the antichrist (who just happens to have been lost due to an incompetent chattering satanic nun) a book of prophecies that's extremely explicit but hard to decipher and a couple of witchfinders who have never seen actual witches. And of course, the battle for good and evil and the destruction of earth as we know it.    As one reviewer said, the apocalypse has never been so funny.    I'm confident that any fan of either of the authors will be pulled in just after reading the author's note and completely unable to do anything but read after page five. It's that good.     Five stars.

B00005Y1UX|2.0|Indecent Proposal was a shocking film for 1993 but if this film was released now, people wouldn't think much of it. Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson portray a young, broke but very much in love married couple who decide to try their luck in Vegas. Robert Redford plays a wealthy, smug man who offers the couple 1 million dollars if he can have one night with his wife, she says yes and the couple's relationship is forever tested. This film appears to be provocative but it falls short, I just couldn't get into this film, very boring and calculated. Skip this one, it's not that steamy.

B00005JPNZ|3.0|I love the Indiana Jones films (especially Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade) and while Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was fun, it really didn't live up to the hype. Not that I thought it would in the first place. The acting is solid all around with Harrison Ford (seeming a little tired at times of this role at 65) and the bad chick played by Cate Blanchett being the standouts for me. The adventure itself is a little on the confusing side, but will keep you interested throughout.<br /><br />The two main flaws with Indy IV are the dialogue which is pretty bad at times (some of it comes across okay) and the heavy use of CGI that you can't help but notice.<br /><br />Just don't go in expecting a soon to be classic movie. As far as the fourth film in a series goes, it is actually good enough to sit beside the other three on your DVD shelf.

This book tells the heart-breaking story of a well-off family in Kerala, India, and its ultimate downfall.  The storyline and the characters are challenging, and I feel compelled to say that the novel is not for those who are faint of heart. Yet, I was mesmerized with how Roy virtually turned the concepts of \\"novel\\" and \\"language\\" on their head and created a work of art. When I finished I felt a little hopeless, I wanted to cry and laugh, and I wanted to re-write the novel to avoid the inevitable conclusion. I pondered how the world would be without discrimination. More than anything, I wanted to read it again. Amazing.
B000YJ85VS|5.0|If you have an interest in why we do the things we do that show little to no logic over and over again, this book will provide superior insight.    It tells us how and why choices (and too many of them) skews our vision and leads us to irrational behavior from lovers to purchasing decisions. It reveals how we anchor our thoughts based on a particular experience and how we may never change our core thoughts (anchor) for the rest of our lives.    There is so much value understanding our behavior if we want to change our reality.    If you are curious about why good people make seemingly irrational decisions about their lives, this will be a real eye-opener. If I am wise, this book will change my life.

He is known as the guy who knows everyone, able to pool the right resources with the right people.<br /><br />How did he achieve this?<br /><br />Years ago, a bit younger and a lot less successful, Keith came to his boss and said, \\"I want to make it to the top. I want to be a great leader. I have what it takes. How do I make it happen?\\"<br /><br />Keith's boss asked him to describe why he thought he had what it takes. So, Keith described all of his accomplishments. His boss listened, then gave the response that changed Keith's life.<br /><br />\\"You've described to me all the things YOU have done. That makes you a great worker. But if you want to be a great leader, you need to build teams. You need to bring people together.\\"<br /><br />Keith took the advice to heart in what may be a controversial act, blurring the lines between friendships and business relationships. Everyone became a potential asset to gain from, offer to, or bridge a connection between.<br /><br />Some of his ideas seem counter-intuitive, such as Pinging, a process that builds relationships one small email or phone call at a time instead of one long meeting at a time, or Managing the Gatekeeper, where he insists a secretary may be the most important person you meet.<br /><br />His style, like the chapters in this book, is short and to the point, but all the more effective because of it. Thanks in part to his coauthor, Fortune Small Business editor Raz, Ferrazzi's book becomes an example of Networking in action, a well-written, anecdotal account of a style anyone can employ.

B0016HNOXQ|1.0|I can't believe all the Great Reviews on this album !! I have been a long time fan of Portishead and was so excited to hear that they were finally putting out a new album. I played it through once and every song had the same african drum loop with the exception of one or two songs. It sounds like to me that they wrote, recorded and released this album in one day. A decade for this junk ? I just waisted my money on this CD and wish I would have only heard this CD before I purchased it.Theres Good music and Bad music and this is just put together pieces of junk.....Save yourself some money and stay away from this one !!!!

B000UR9T8C|3.0|I don't understand why so many people think \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is the best movie in this trilogy. I thought it was the weakest film by far. In the film, Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), is on top of the world...both literally and figuratively. He's happily involved with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and Spider-Man is loved and adored by all of New York City. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. Mary Jane is fired from her first Broadway show, and Peter's freelance photography career is threatened when Eddie (Topher Grace), a rival photographer, tries to steal Peter's thunder. Things with Peter's former best friend, Harry (James Franco), aren't going very well, either, and there's also a new villain in town: the mysterious Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), who is connected to the death of Peter's uncle. On top of everything else, Peter encounters a strange black organism that transforms into a powerful black Spider-Man suit, which turns out to have devastating consequences.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that there's way too much going on at once, and all of the subplots and supporting characters are significantly short-changed. There were also many more stupid one-liners and failed comedic moments in \\"Spider-Man 3\\" than in the first three films, and I was extremely disappointed with the ending, which was unnecessarily depressing. I'm sure the film's producers are hoping for a \\"Spider-Man 4,\\" but this series just needs to go away before it embarrasses itself even more.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I had been using Jillian's Biggest Winner set for 2 months, so I felt this would be a good addition to it. I have already lost 45 pounds, so I was looking for something to help tone up. Oh my gosh!! I was able to get through the other workouts no problem. When I did this one I was sore for 3 days (the good kind of sore). I'm currenly on Level 1, Day 5 and I can already tell the difference in my ability to keep up with the workout, and in the way I look. Trust me, just push though it; and just as she promises, you will get results! I would reccomend not doing this for 30 days straight though. Give yourself about 6 weeks to complete the \\"30 days\\" because you will be very sore the first week.

This hotel was once build on a ancient Indian burial ground and long ago, a family who did a similar job to Jack's at the Overlook Hotel but the father went insane as he butchered his family to pieces. The hotel is haunted by spirits from the past that have come to haunt the family and make Jack go insane with madness as he falls off the edge to insanity.<br /><br />An epic supernatural horror thriller shocker from Stanley Kubrick is a very loose adaptation of the timeless novel from Stephen King which he said that he disliked this movie version. It's a surreal and nightmarish film about madness and supernatural with great acting by the cast especially Scatman Crothers who plays the lovable chef, the music score by Wendy Carlos is chilling for particular and the whole film is atmospheric. I also like how they use special camera tricks and high tension for the film, sure it almost nowhere near the novel but this is a classic horror movie that will remain a masterpiece.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives the movie a perfect look with sharp crystal clear picture and awesome CD-quality sound with interactive extras like audio comemntary, \\"The Making of the Shining\\" with optional commentary, theatrical trailer and three new featurettes.
0380730405|5.0|\\"Last night I dreamt I was in Manderley again.\\"<br /><br />And so begins a literary classic that, to me at least, is so riveting and wonderful that you have to read it again and again.  And that's what I've done -- I have read it for the third time.  First published in 1938 and set some time during the 1920s, this is the tale of a nameless heroine who has no idea what she's gotten herself into when she marries Maxim de Winter.  At twenty-one, her future is uncertain, and she had settled for a life as a lady's companion to Mrs. Van Hopper, an American social climber.  They are vacationing in Monte Carlo, and that's where she meets Maxim -- a dark, handsome, sophisticated and mysterious widower who is twice her age.  When he pays her special attention and proposes marriage, she immediately agrees.  She fell in love with him from the moment she met him, after all, and she had heard wonderful things about his English estate, the beautiful Manderley.  Mrs. Van Hopper gives her a warning.  She will regret it.  He will marry her because he cannot stand to be alone in that house.  But the heroine marries him anyway.  After all, her new life will be a marriage to a handsome man who owns one of the most fascinating homes in England.  What could possibly go wrong?<br /><br />No sooner does she arrive at Manderley than she discovers just how important the late Mrs. de Winter had been to the old estate.  Everyone there follows things as though Rebecca, the late wife, still lives there.  This is most evident with Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca's former personal maid, who takes an immediate dislike to the heroine.  The heroine is afraid of the servants and of disrupting the order of the house and is soon consumed with jealousy for Rebecca.  After all, she was a tall, dark, beautiful and vivacious party girl -- everything the heroine is not.  What's more important is that Maxim still loves Rebecca.  He is taciturn and brooding, and she is constantly afraid of upsetting him.  After a disastrous fancy dress ball thrown in her honor, the heroine feels that perhaps it had been a mistake to marry Maxim.  But, in spite of Mrs. Danvers's creepy attempts to frighten her, she will remain in Manderley, where nothing is the way it seems.<br /><br />What I love most about the novel is the narrative.  Daphne de Maurier had a gifted way of drawing you into this dark, ironic and very sinister tale of secrets, deception and death.  The nameless heroine (the author wrote that she hadn't given her a name because she simply couldn't think of one good enough for her) is young and naïve and it shows.  To me, it is frustrating that she has no name, especially since Rebecca, her rival in mind if not in life, is so prominent in the story that the book had been named after her.  Then again, this gives a special emphasis to the fact that the heroine finds herself lacking in manner compared to Maxim's previous wife, so perhaps the not having a name works.  I also love the gothic feel of the story and how well-woven it is.  Twists and turns creep in from beginning to end.  Even though I had read Rebecca twice before, it was like reading it for the first time.  The narrative and descriptions are as vivid, Maxim is as enigmatic as ever, Mrs. Danvers still gives me the creeps, and the ending gave me goose bumps again.  The novel felt unfinished, which is why the author wrote an epilogue that is included in this edition, but I kind of liked leaving things to my imagination, so I only read the first two pages of the epilogue and skipped the rest.  Rebecca is one of those classics that you'd want to keep in your library for rereading, much like Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and other gothic classics.  If you'd like to read a novel that is similar to this one, I recommend Dragonwyck by Anya Seton.ous fancy dress ball thrown in her honor, the heroine feels that perhaps it had been a mistake to marry Maxim.

032147404X|4.0|once you get past the authors  humor the book has good content and is full of good advice. I have put his hints to work in photoshop and taking pictures. I'm new to DSLR but have used 35mm SLR and high end P&S cameras for a few years. I own several other books by Scott Kelby, all are good. I would recomend this book.
0143038419|5.0|I didn't want this book to end. The author is witty and extremely likable. The writing is steller. And her adventure is poweful. Even though my own faith differs so much from hers, I found myself drawn closer to God by reading about her spiritual journey. Awesome!
B0002S943O|5.0|I recently upgraded from the VHS version of this film. Definitely worth it. As others have stated, this is Depeche Mode at their absolute peak.     I was with them from the beginning, I saw them in the company of maybe 50 other people in Philadelphia at a tiny bar in 1982. This was way before Dave emerged from his shell. After their first encore I asked Dave to play See You, he told me they couldn't rewind the tape (the tape machine supplying drums at that time).    The visuals -and sound- on this DVD are some of the best for a non-digital transfer. Awesome.
B000M39SYE|5.0|I had heard a lot about this film but until recently had never seen it. My only question is, why aren't Bush and Cheney in jail. I researched the occupation of Iraq quite a bit before seeing this film. I wanted to be able to make an informed opinion. Frankly, I think their needs to be a part 2. With all that's come out since this was originally done their should be a follow-up. I think people need to open their eyes and stop defending this man. It's unbelievable that Bush may get away with this. He's shown us just how far the rich will go to get richer.
079073639X|3.0|I love movies that I have to figure out and so on that point I'm really feeling this movie.  Not only was the movie itself good, but it was also scary at times, and there was plenty of suspense.  We get a lot of \\"what\\" but very few \\"whys\\" so it keeps you kind of glued.  Like everyone else I don't like the ending.  They could have gone in so many other directions with the ending but they went with the strangest one.  The remaining charachters decided to just \\"forget\\" everything that happened....ummm...??? Ok.  This movie was a lot like the Event Horizon.  I loved the Event Horizon also.  I'd encourage anyone to see.
B00005JLF5|3.0|Though an essential part of any true Star Trek collection, the first season of Deep Space Nine isn't fully developed, especially with regards to the characters (Dax, most noticeably).  Good, but the series will grow and become something much greater than what is in this particular season, so don't give up if you find that you don't care too much for the early episodes.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|This film was perfect to a fault.  Daniel Day-Lewis's acting was extraordinary, and the portrait painted of extreme Narcissism between him and Paul Dano was flawless.  I cannot imagine changing this movie in any way.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I was skeptical to buy this, because I'm an old fan, and I had most of the songs on older CD's. But from the very first cut \\"Down By The River\\", I could tell these songs jumped out with more presence than I ever heard them before. Actually, these most all are my Neil Young favorites and these are most of the songs you'd want to hear again and again anyway, so this is a very logical choice for the new or the old fan. All of them sound like they were just recorded this morning. Highly Recommended!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|There's no doubt the ladies are very talented, but it's the entire show and organization that has won me over.  A beautiful and palpable chemistry among not only performers but also audience was presented and showed while the event took place.  Colors, sounds, instrument and orchestral accompaniments were flawless, spirit was high, clothing was superb, facial expression and musicianship of the Celtic ladies, background voices, balance of song selections, all are wonderfully right.
079073639X|3.0|This movie starts out with some great special effects and introduces some very intriguing questions about the nature of time and space.<br /><br />Those questions are never fully answered though as far as I noticed.<br /><br />They discover an apparent extra terrestrial space craft that has been in the ocean since the 1700s and go down and explore it.  But as the movie goes on you realize nothing is quite what it appears to be and anything that people can imagine is possible.<br /><br />You have to use your imagination quite a bit with these types of movies.  For example how likely is it that three people with no training could do everything required to operate an underwater military facility ?<br /><br />There's the typical latches that are easy to manually open to let all of the water from the ocean into the lab, etc., and then close them again with no major effects.  I guess the design of those latches hasn't changed much since World War 1.<br /><br />I'm not sure Dustin Hoffman was a great casting job for the role of one of the scientists.  Actually for me his role sort of provides comic relief.  I don't think action / SciFi is a great venue for Hoffman.  Still it was nice to see him in a movie anyway for old times' sake.  In that sense maybe it was a good role for him.<br /><br />Sharon Stone is looking good still.<br /><br />I think I have heard Peter Coyote on some documentaries that he narrated.  He has a great voice for narrating tv shows.<br /><br />  Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:0792833287 Midnight Cowboy]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005LZOD Open Your Eyes]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00009NHC0 The Thing from Another World]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0002CHK1S The Thing (Collector's Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00079HZT8 Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction?]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000TBYA06 The Truth About The Philadelphia Experiment]]
B0010X745K|2.0|I saw the previews, I read the reviews, I rented it on DVD. I was not prepared for the ending. The ending is insanely depressing, it breaks the rules of normal movie etiquette, in the most disheartening way. I won't give up the ending, but after an hour and a half of enjoying a scary movie, it turned into almost a psychological \\"thriller\\" that left me needing a walk on a sunny day. Unfortunately it was 10 pm and I went to bed with a pit in my stomach. Now you're warned!   BTW if you'd like to warn me about other good movies that will leave me heartbroken in a bad way, go ahead.    Thanks
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Being a huge fan of period dramas, literary adaptations and Keira Knightley, I was delighted by the latest adaptation of Jane Austen's [[ASIN:0307386864 Pride and Prejudice]]. It is everything a movie should be, and then some. Great storytelling, an amazing soundtrack, an innovative director and a splendid soundtrack, it is definitely a movie you should own.<br />It tells a classic story of Elizabeth Bennet, a smart, boyish heroine who meets the handsome Mr. Darcy, and judging solely on first impressions, believes he is \\"the last man on Earth she could ever possibly be prevailed upon to marry\\". Of course, it wouldn't be a Jane Austen adaptation if it wasn't for numerous plot twists, complicated character connections and humorous plays on words.<br />Keira Knightley is perfect as Elizabeth, the role which not only propelled her to stardom, but also earned her an Oscar nomination in 2005. She is everything a classic heroine should be - sensual, expressive and beautiful, maybe even a little more than she should have been. On the other hand, there is Matthew Macfadyen, who makes a great, darker Mr. Darcy. Also in the all-star cast are veterans Donald Sutherland and Dame Judy Dench.<br />Director Joe Wright did an incredible job. Not only did he play with the source in a very respectful, yet creative way, he used many tricks to make us care for these characters and believe their plights are just as well possible today. He also uses the stunning British countryside a number of times, and it is one of the film's best props - it is able to, accompanied by a great soundtrack, reflect the characters' emotions and send chills up and down one's spine.<br />\\"Pride & Prejudice\\" is definitely one of the best romantic movies and literary adaptations of the century, and one you should have on your shelf for sure.
0440241413|4.0|For a funny light read, Confessions of a Shopaholic is great.  This is my first Sophie Kinsella book, and wasn't aware that it was part of a series when I stumbled across it. I'm not a huge British chick-lit fan, and I wouldn't necessarily run out to read the entire series, but this book in and of itself is certainly a fun escape from reality.  The main character is a little frustrating at times, due to her compulsive shopping habits, but her quirks make this book into a deliciously fun read that had me laughing out loud quite a few times!
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|I liked this more than the other ones, i think it was because when I saw this as a kid it scared the hell outta me, but I couldn't stop watching it for some reason. It's just a good movie.
B000TGCR38|4.0|\\"Black Book\\" attempts to assay a path between Spielberg's historical melodrama and Hitchcock's espionage thriller.  There are one or two jarring missteps along the way, which cause me to grade director Paul Verhoeven's effort with four stars. But, flawed though it may be, and even though it covers similar territory as many other films (\\"Lacombe, Lucien\\" and \\"The Night Porter\\" are among many that spring to mind) \\"Black Book\\" remains fresh and hugely entertaining.    I credit vibrant performances, especially the lead performance by Carice Van Houten.  She is never less than credible in portraying the smart, sassy survivor Rachel Stein, AKA \\"Ellis De Vries\\".  This is a character and a performance that withstands all humiliations. (If you've seen the film, you will understand what I mean.)    Paul Verhoeven as a director always steers clear of the \\"politically correct\\".  But I don't believe that he goes over the top, here.  There is very little in the movie that is prurient, or even sexy, except perhaps a ribald song about a \\"little pianola\\".      Of more interest are the ways that Verhoeven continues to examine the psychology of Fascism, all the while turning many cliches on their heads.  Like Jerzy Kosinski in his novel \\"The Painted Bird\\", Verhoeven shows us that ignorant mobs can be more barbaric than Nazis, and that Fascism itself is a virus that few are immune from.  Verhoeven even satirizes the severe religious fervor of some Dutch Christians, as he portrays a Resistance fighter who refuses to kill a collaborator until the unfortunate man makes the mistake of taking the lord's name in vain.    \\"Black Book\\" fulfills the first imperative of moviemaking, which is to entertain.  If some people find it \\"too entertaining\\" for the subject matter, that is their problem.    P.S.  If anyone is interested in reading an excellent book of fiction on similar themes (i.e. a woman who survives the war through collaboration), I recommend Jenna Blum's \\"Those Who Save Us\\" wholeheartedly.
B000002LVB|4.0|The Velvet Underground-Loaded ****<br /><br />Loaded was the groups first album after Cale decided to bail, and I must say for a band who just lost one of it's core and founding members, Loaded came out as a pretty solid album, even if it plays more like a Solo Lou Reed album than a Velvet Underground album. The shocking subject matter is still here, the shocking satire by way of catchy amazing pop tunes. Reeds striped down rock n' roll is what makes the album, I'm sorry but it is. He wrote everything here with very little input from Maureen, and as for the rest they were more or less unimportant here. Don't misinterperet that sentence because I feel that they are all vital members but this really was Reeds album.<br /><br />'Who Loves The Sun' opens the album and has the same feel as 'Candy Says' did for the self title album, though this is much, much better. The self wallowing lyrics make this one of the greatest love songs of all time. The Violent Femmes would be nothing with this track. 'Sweet Jane' and Rock & Roll' were both obviously VU classics, as was 'Head Held High.' In fact 'Head Held High' sounds a lot like Reeds solo work from the 1990's. 'Lonesome Cowboy Bill' and 'I Found A Reason' however are less than stellar. The former is hokey and very childish feeling, and the latter could have been amazing had it not been for the annoying chorus.<br /><br />On the whole the album is a very strong one. Many of the songs have gone on to become rock classics, and with the exception of two minor mishaps, the rest of the songs are great tracks as well. With the avant-garde Cale gone the band was able to focus on what they do best which was striped down rock with great poetic Reed lyrics. So no this is not THE best VU album it is still a most own.

0061245097|5.0|Cat Crawford has adjusted to her life as a Special Agent, tracking down and killing vampires as part of her team.  Her half-vampire skills have come in handy in her new role.  She still hasn't forgotten Bones, the vampire who trained her, no matter how hard she has tried.  Someone has now targeted Cat for death, bringing Bones back into her life.  Will Bones and Cat be overcome the differences between them?         What a fabulous second entry in the Night Huntress series!  If you haven't read HALFWAY TO THE GRAVE, stop right now and read it first.  The relationship between Bones and Cat is a complicated one and the author establishes the grounds for the events of ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE quite well in the first story.  Without reading the first novel, I'm not sure if readers will get the full flavor of the depth of the emotions between Cat and Bones.          Jeaniene Frost splendidly adds to the world of intrigue she carefully crafted in HALFWAY TO THE GRAVE.  Vampire politics are beginning to emerge and the intricate details that make up this world are starting to pull together into one very interesting picture.  ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE is not simply a book about vampire slaying but is instead a very rich and deep world in which we are given some new twists on vampires.          I love the way Cat's character is developing.  She is still young but she is growing up rapidly.  And who can't help but love Bones?  The secondary characters that have been introduced add a lot to the storyline and I look forward to seeing more of these characters in future books as I suspect Jeaniene Frost has a few surprises in store for us.         ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE solidifies Jeaniene Frost's place in the ranks of the top urban fantasy writers.  If you are craving a new vampire series, the Night Huntress series is definitely one to check out!    COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES
B0006GANN2|1.0|This had to be the most boring cop movie I've ever seen. Not only was it boring, but I found myself hoping the bad guys got away.  The movie was basically about a racist, sadistic cop who spent the whole movie either beating innocent African Americans or chasing a drug dealing ring.  No intersting dialogue at all.  The only halfway good part was the car chase scene, but when Doyle almost hit a woman crossing the street, I lost interest in the dynamics because it was so thoughtless.  Then, if you weren't sleep by then, you get to watch the police tear up a drug dealer's car for probably 15 minutes.  What was really stupid was that they completely ripped the car up, upholstery and all; however, when the owner picked the car up, it was in tip-top shape.  I don't know what other movies this one was up against for the Acadamey Awards, but surely one of them was better.
6304698690|5.0|When an earthquake in India leaves her an orphan, Mary Lennox is sent to live at her uncle's remote estate in England.  The spoiled, bratty Mary is quite miserable with no one to talk to or play with and a stern housekeeper (Maggie Smith) hovering over her.  When Mary begins exploring the manor, she discovers not only a secret garden but also a secret cousin!<br /><br />This is a beautifully-filmed children's story about the power of friendship and overcoming adversity.  I wasn't familiar with the 1911 book (although I want to read it now), so I expected something awful to happen to the garden or the children, but only good things happen, so it's ideal for kids of all ages.<br /><br />The Yorkshire location is lovely and the acting is uniformly wonderful.  The joys of bringing an old garden to life and befriending a shut-in child are the simple, yet profound pleasures of this story. Highly recommended for those who like sweet, sentimental stories.
0739359320|5.0|\\"The Testament\\" is, I think, John Grisham's finest work. Not because it is one of his better 'the lawyers will do anything for the money' books, and not because it is an excellent morality tale about what greed does to people, but because it is a remarkable story of self-discovery, and finding humanity in yourself when maybe you had thought it was just too late.        Before discussing the book, a critical point. As we all know, every audio book is almost pre-determined by the reader chosen to narrate. Great books can become boring. Bad books can become enjoyable depending on who is doing the 'telling.' This unabridged version of the book is read by simply the greatest reader of our generation - Frank Muller. You will absolutely treasure his voice and his incredible characterizations. He could draw you into a reading of your grocery list.       The story in a nutshell - Nate O'Riley, an alcoholic, unhappy, down on his luck trial attorney, is about to lose his license and be \\"asked\\" to leave his firm. He is picked, mostly as a convenience to the firm, by the senior partner, to travel to the isolated reaches of northern Brazil (\\"the Pantanal\\")to locate Rachel, the illegitimate daughter of Troy Phelan, the firm's client, in order to administer his $11 billion estate after his death.  The father hated his own six children and his ex-wives so much that he not only wanted to leave them with nothing, but also hoped to leave them destitute for the rest of their hateful and unhappy lives. After some near misses, Nate and his guides (who are colorful characters themselves) finally locate Rachel in the remote reaches of the jungle. The battle between the vultures (and their lawyers) and Nate, (unbeknownst to Rachel) as her attorney, thus begins. The only problem with Troy's plan - she has committed her life to God and has absolutely no interest in the money (we're talking #11 billion here with a 'b')  The story unfolds at a nice pace. Muller draws the listener in and thediscs will fly in and out of your player as Nate travels to Brazil, encounters the locals, boats up the river and finally meets and is captivated by Rachel, who helps him understand that maybe there is a bit more at stake in all of this than the money.       The return to the states and the inevitable court fight may be Grisham's best writing. He balances humorous touches (greedy, nasty siblings don't seem to have a great deal of trust amongst themselves) with the \\"attack dog\\" mentality and dishonesty of the family lawyers to provide a  tense, often funny roller coaster ride to the finish. The ending arrives all too quickly and will leave you - not sad, but certainly reflective about the characters and how they might reflect a bit of all of us more than we might admit be willing to admit.        It's what great storytellers do, and John Grisham, (and Frank Muller), with \\"the Testament,\\" shows that he is one of our greatest storytellers.
B00003CXTG|3.0|..but I did.<br /><br />On Thursday, we came home after having dinner with one of our customers, and found my brother-in-law (who's staying with us for a few days) just starting to watch Pearl Harbor. (It was subtitled, of course, in Chinese.)<br /><br />So, I sat down to watch it, and was mildly entertained.<br /><br />I've watched some good films, and bad films. This was in the middle. Michael Bay usually falls into two traps with his films: big action montage scenes, and cliched lines. Both are in evidence here, but the big action montage scenes actually do come in handy during the scenes detailing the attack on Pearl Harbor itself. I guess it's one of those times in which a weakness turns out to be a strength under certain circumstances.<br /><br />So, while I wouldn't recommend seeking this film out as a life mission, I wouldn't run away from it, screaming, either. How's that for \\"damned by faint praise\\"? I think this was better than The Island, though.
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini must love women.  I kept having to remind myself as I devoured this wonderful book -- that it was written by a man. The story of these two extraordinary women and their unlikely relationship in the midst of war and repression, is anchored in Mr. Hosseini's wonderful character development.  I felt like I lived inside of Mariam and Laila's heads.  I felt enormously priviledged to be able to even imagine that such women do really exist and that they do prevail over devastating life situations.  This book is a must-read for anyone who questions the unquenchable nature of the human spirit.  Wendy Dolber, author, The Guru Next Door, A Teacher's Legacy.[[ASIN:1934450006 The Guru Next Door]]
B000OV170W|3.0|The topic of this story is extremely compelling, and the characters are interesting.  However, Picoult's melodramatic, soap-opera style of writing really got on my nerves.  Here's a short sample: \\"I have always known his answers.  What I've forgotten are the questions\\".    So if you like this kind of writing or are interested in the topic of savior siblings or bioethics in general, I recommend this book.  If not, don't read it.
1581804849|4.0|Good solid book, but nothing really stellar.  It has some good techniques, but not the Wow factor in many of the other books
B00005UK1F|5.0|With \\"Light of Day, Day of Darkness\\", Green Carnation crafted the ultimate epic: a 60-minute song that fills the entire album.  While some might expect the sort of cheesy excess that progressive music unfortunately so often connotes, this album/song/whatever is in fact a stunning display of immaculate songwriting craft.<br /><br />Unlike some other albums who make this claim, this album really is \\"one long song\\" (as much as I love \\"A Pleasant Shade of Gray\\", it really doesn't sound like one continuous song to me).  Not only does this song occupy only one track, but it contains the continuity of one single composition, rather than a bunch of shorter songs that all flow together.  Like a classical sonata, it contains hugely dynamic rise and fall, and plenty of repeated themes that are reinforced throughout.  Musically it is subtle and nuanced, and the musicianship is excellent but never showy or overbearing.  The song goes from mesmerizing melodies, to crunchy metal riffs, to ambient interludes adorned with beautiful female vocals, to the occasional black metalish blast beat (a little of that Emperor influence finding its way in there).  And of course there's Kjetil's subtly haunting vocals, which weave their way through the myriad textures like a ghostly spectre.  I'd say that the overall tone is somewhat dark, but not in a really depressing or gothic manner.  There's always a sort of glimmer of hope buried within the mire, that keeps it from ever becoming particularly gloomy.<br /><br />Anyway, this is simply progressive metal at its absolute best.  This is just about everything a great epic should be, as tasteful and stylish as it is exhilirating and audacious.  The only other album I've heard from them at this time is \\"Acoustic Verses\\", which is a much more stripped-down folk-inspired sound, but the fact that they did so well with both of these very contrasting styles has really got me excited to see what else this band has to offer.
B0002YCUYI|5.0|Ok, first the confusing part. I have this album on vynyl, issued by ABC Dunhil in 1969. The album is called \\"for those about to die,\\" another album by this band , and it is very unclear as to which album is which. I know Vertigo had a lot of distribution deals with a lot of U.S. labals, but in this case, it is really a puzzle as to how these were issued.<br /><br />But the music is great. It is very hard-edged blues rock, but absolutely infected with jazz. \\"The Kettle,\\" is based on a nasty Cream-like riff, and rocks like a bulldozer. \\"Elegy\\" is jazzier, but has the same blistering guitar work as the first track.  Throughout, the band takes blues, adds all kinds of unpredictable chord subtitutons, which gives the music a sharp, suprising edge.<br /><br />The guys in this band were all jazz musicans, but they had worked with John Mayall, and had  a deep, instinctive understanding for the FEEL, not just the form of the blues. The hybrid is increadablely powerful. This is music that is impossible not to like.
B00104QSOM|5.0|The film has well earned its prizes, awards and other distinctions. But beyond these labels on the sleeve of the DVD or the poster of the film, the film will remain a milestone in the cinema that tries to show the real world and the ruthlessness of its survival instinct.<br /><br />The first element I will point out is that it gives the lie to Hubbard and his survival in scientology. In the real world there is no survival without development and development is first: no development then extinction. Ask Neanderthals when he was to share Europe with Cro-Magnon. The poor Neanderthals could not even fish and ran like mammoths. The real survival is in the power of man, as a species and as an individual, to develop. Survival that does not bring and presuppose development is just a fake, a false prophecy. I say that for two reasons.<br /><br />The first reason is that without the oil industry, there would have been no car industry (and other inner combustion engine industry), no gas station networks, no highway networks, no suburban development. That's the most clear and brutal side of the film. The oil industry brings a new phase in the industrial revolution of its own on which we are still living and polluting. Millions of people got jobs, millions of people got income, millions of people got a present and a future. Survival in development. But this development is also violent and it is the fitter who can develop most and fastest. So on the starting line there might be many people but on the arrival line there will only be a few if not only one. It is easier to make a camel get through the eye of a needle than to bring many winners on the winning line of industrial competition.<br /><br />The film is absolutely ugly and gruesome about it and it makes so many people, in the film, completely sick and disturbed. A man is ready to assume the identity of another provided this new identity is that of the main character's brother for an obvious profit. Don't forget that prophet and profit are homonyms. A child is ready to set the hut in which he is sleeping with his father and fake uncle ablaze just to mark his territory and his resistance and his dissatisfaction. And there are so many other cases.<br /><br />Then, my second reason, in any fast developing situation like this one there are some people who will take advantage of it to mentally control the change, that is to say to gather people behind them and then pressurize the industrialists so that the gurus can get what they want, which is worldly power and money. These are the second type of false prophets of the industrial age. They can be religious and affiliated to any church, most of them being purely opportunistic about the rich provided they give money to the various churches, temples, synagogues or mosques, and of course other good benefacting (I mean bringing a profit to the prophet) organizations. The religious organizations and their prophets, false most of them, are the typical form of that vampiristic money sucking leeches in the USA who can only survive if God blesses the child and America.<br /><br />But there are other forms that are just as deadly and life-sucking. You can see Hitler and the Nazi party, and all other fascistic movements, as exactly the same ambition: take advantage of the developing industrial revolution to line your pockets with power and money. But on the other side you can have all the socialistic and communistic preaching that is exactly the same thing. And the military forces can decide to use their weapons to become the false prophets of this industrial development. The worst concoction is when one of these political movements takes the control of the armed forces, or vice versa, and then they establish a totally irreversible dictatorship.<br /><br />Irreversible, well, maybe not.<br /><br />The film suggests that you can always become deaf to these and run away and start your own development in some other country or state. It also suggests thatthe industrialists and the prophesizing profiteers may get into a fight to the death and then some others will come and pick up the pieces and recuperate the whole treasure chest. The film does not allude to the political mode of democratic management of this development. Just be the prophet that will win an election till a new prophet comes and wins it against you and gets you out. But be sure this intruder will not last long and will be out of the job when another one comes and claim victory. Democracy is a permanent rotation of false prophets.<br /><br />Alleluia<br /><br />Jacques COULARDEAUthe industrialists and the prophesizing profiteers may get into a fight to the death and then some others will come and pick up the pieces and recuperate the whole treasure chest.

B000VWE5OY|4.0|I never got into the X-Files, but I love Torchwood!  It's smart, funny, and a little bit naughty.  The science fiction parts are always interesting, sometimes scary and usually pretty cool.  All the characters are well developed, well written and well acted.  The show is anything but predictable.  Many times, the show goes in an unexpected direction and really keeps you on your toes.  Russell T Davies is a genius.  I've even started watching Doctor Who for some of the background to Torchwood.  Can't wait until Torchwood - Season 2 comes out in September!
B00005V9IL|5.0|The Abyss is a great sci-fi movie of it's time, and one of my favorites.     But- The point of this review is to show that in 2002, squeezing 2 versions of the movie AND special features onto 1 DVD may have been a \\"money-saver\\" for the studio, but to have to listen to compressed 2-channel Dolby \\"Surround\\" tracks is torture if you have even a half-way decent sound system. (i.e.- not TV speakers)    The fact is- 'Dolby Surround' is not actually surround sound. Incase you don't know- Stereo is stereo, and if you imbed a reverse-phase track so that D. Surround decoders (on just about every 5 speaker reciever for the last 10 years) play audio in the rear, you're just listening to louder sound effects that are coming also from the front 2 speakers. The center channel is just taking the mono tracks and playing them independently (and there is more than just dialog in this). No \\".1\\" track included either, your sub just plays some low frequency sounds from the crappy low res audio in stereo. Barely noticeable.    -Also, the video is actually a 'fullscreen' aspect ratio with the 1.35:1 movie aspect embedded inside of it. So the result is (even with progressive scan) LOWER RESOLUTION THAN 480p (technically lower than 480i on the disc itself)    Point being- even in 2002-2003, the studio (Fox) could have just spent a few more cents per unit to manufacture these in 2 disc form, and there wouldn't be a problem. Or just not make the decision to put 2 versions of the same movie in it.    GET THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION if you like this movie, which I do. I'm returning this one (if I can)
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I'm very satisfied with the dvds! I LOVED the movie, it was absolutely amazing, and the extras on the second dvd were great. I always like to see what goes on behind the scenes and hear what the director's vision was for certain parts (especially with this movie being VERY artistic and symbolic). It's a great set!
B00122M2QU|4.0|Cavalera Brothers have really grown from Sepultura on this album, although undeniably there are similarities in the songwriting from time to time (the second song on the album \\"Sanctuary\\" has the richest Sepultura feel to it)that is to be expected. What struck me most on this album was the quality and quantity of guitar solos in the songs and lengthy instrumental chapters. Although the lyrics are a something to be desired in places and they do get a bit redundant (only reason for four stars in stead of five) and annoying from time to time they don't subtract so much from the music that they make that much of a difference.   All in all I am impressed with the Cavalera Conspiracy and I recommend this album for those that enjoy good, hard, thick metal sounds.
B000001FTQ|5.0|As a die-hard U2 fan and collector (I have at least 40 bootlegs of theirs), their 1985 EP 'Wide Awake In America' remains one of my favorite efforts from U2. While it does only contain 4 songs total, it's still something that U2 fans should not overlook.    'Bad' was recorded in London in early 1985. It is an awesome version of the song, one of the best I've heard; it is by a long shot better than the studio version that appears on 'The Unforgettable Fire' (1984).    'A Sort Of Homecoming' is even better than 'Bad.' This version is a lot heavier than the album version from 'The Unforgettable Fire,' but it's probably better. It's a cool version; you can hear the crowd getting involved.    The last two songs are outtakes from 'The Unforgettable Fire.'     'The Three Sunrises' is a song that should have easily made the cut for the record. It's got a great bass line from Adam, and Bono's vocals are spot on, as are Edge's rocking guitars. Larry's drumming gets pretty heavy at times.    'Love Comes Tumbling' is a song that reminds me of one of their early efforts. It would be great to hear on 'Unforgettable Fire' as well, but it fits great here too. (Note to U2 collectors: On 'The Best of 1980-1990,' there is a bonus disc containing B-sides and outtakes from albums. Both 'The Three Sunrises' and 'Love Comes Tumbling' appear on that. But 'Love Comes Tumbling' comes with a guitar intro from Edge that doesn't appear here. If you can, try to hunt down that version as well.)    Overall, if you've never checked out this record, than you need to. It rocks, and it's one of my all-time favorites from U2.    Highly recommended for any U2 fan. A classic EP.     ENJOY!!!
B00005JPNZ|3.0|Harrison Ford still has it, Karen Allen still has it but apparently George Lucas and Speilberg doesn't.     The plot is pretty loose the Soviets after a great weapon hidden away in a wooden box in a forgotten warehouse. And although the lost ark makes a brief cameo we are instead looking for the contents of area 54.    Of course the plot weak as it is plays 2nd fiddle to the ongoing and never ending chase.  We are crashed, sunk, buried, chased and made to dodge the Bomb.  Because the characters are ones we care about it adds to the moments but they seem recycled.  Those moments are great fun but stringing them together do not a great movie make.    In the first and 3rd movie the stakes are made clear early, an great battle between good and evil with the world at stake.  Hollywood today being what it is they can't quite bring themselves to make that clear connection when the foes are Communists until very deep in the movie and even then not without the obligatory early \\"Red Scare\\" scenes to suggest moral equivalence.  Cate Blanchette's performance doesn't help matters, she is as wooden a character as we have ever seen but I suspect a lot of that is due to the writing.  The presence of Marian seems to preclude any kind of relationship or bond forming between Blanchette and Ford (although it did't have to) so instead she becomes a stock villian.     Don't get me wrong there are stunning visuals, great stunts, good comedy and Shia LeBouf does a much better job than the critics give him credit for but like [[ASIN:1903654297 Dr Who Audio Twin CD Loups Garoux (Doctor Who)]] for the Big Finish Dr. Who audios or the [[ASIN:B000E8QVBK Marx Bros.: Go West/The Big Store]] for the Marx Brothers it is an avg entry in a quality franchise.    Still you can't have the whole collection without it and it is enjoyable.  The best way to describe it is like a scene in an old comic book I once had. The JLA finds themself in an alternate universe and when the 40's Superman expresses satisfaction at fighting the Nazi's Green Arrow Comments \\"Lets not spoil the man of steel's fun.\\"  Dr. Fate replies \\"Tis not fun tis nostalgia\\".  Well the movie is a bit fun but its appeal is largely due to nostalgia.    This isn't a bad choice for a movie but Prince Caspin is a better one.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My family loves this game!  We have played it many times with our children and with other adults.  It is very easy to learn.  My 8 year old son does well, and my 6 year old daughter does fairly well with it (although I think she places pieces randomly instead of planning her strategy).  Even with different skill levels you can have a lot of fun.  I like the fact that Blokus is entertaining while being educational and exercising your mind in a creative way.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|I really enjoyed seeing the conclusion to the series.  I hope there are more movies in the future !!
0316067601|5.0|Great book are hard to come by, well at least while deployed. LONE SURVIVOR is beginning to end the best and most thrilling military related book that I have read. I read this book front to back with out a break. I recommend everyone to read this book. I would also like to thank the author for putting this book together; because I'm sure re-living the memories was not easy and thank him for his service.

0790749815|5.0|I'm not sure about why the more recent reviewers are having so much trouble with their dvds and I can only assume that the recent batch out of the factory has got major product quality issues as my copy works just fine albeit I bought mine at least a couple of years ago.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound quality as well as the picture quality of my dvd is excellent too.<br /><br />People have to recognise that most of Hitch's films combine elements of humour together with suspense and thrills and what makes this film great is the nice balance of these that's apparent.  The witty dialogue and snappy one-liner jokes delivered by the brilliant Cary Grant still hold up well today.  The Kafka-esque storyline is meant to be so outrageous as to be funny and if taken in that spirit many of the scenes are very entertaining indeed.  The ludicrousness of trying to kill \\"George Kaplan\\" by filling him with alcohol and then helping him drive off a mountain's edge, being chased by a crop-duster in the middle of nowhere, etc make fans of Kafka's works like \\"The Trial\\" and \\"Metamorphosis\\" who can appreciate the genre truly appreciate and enjoy this film masterpiece.<br /><br />Granted some of the scenes do not make much logical sense such as when Eve Kendell talks to Martin Landau's character from a phone booth while he is doing so from another phone in the same line of booths and the strange way the crop duster slams into the oil tanker but that's just the point with Kafka-esques situations in that they are supposed to be ridiculous.  Despite these screenplay \\"shortcomings\\" the acting is very good and I liked the camera angles very much for an overall very good film.  Great combination of humour, thrills and spills, tension and drama makes this a classic film for the ages.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Updated 11 May 2011:<br /><br />Amazon will not let me review the 50th Anniversary Blu-Ray Book Edition separately and so I'll have to append it here.  This film does benefit from the 1080p treatment picture quality-wise although the improvement is not a vast one as compared with the DVD release that I wrote about before.  There are also a few frames interspersed here and there which are poor but overall it is still an improvement albeit not massively so over the DVD.  The sound quality however is an improvement worth shouting about coming in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround sound although there are some weak audio spots at certain parts especially when it comes to dialogue.  The picture book is nice to behold and will please collectors and fans alike.  The special features are what really make this reissue worth shouting about as we have various directors like Friedkin, Scorcese and Spielberg talking about how Hitchcock influenced them and you even see spots in their movies where they borrowed from elements of Hitch's work.<br /><br />Overall, this is a worthy upgrade of the film more so for the great special feature documentaries than for the picture and sound quality which despite being still better in 1080p than the dvd release is not a great leap better in my opinion.<br /><br />Recommended.ure quality-wise although the improvement is not a vast one as compared with the DVD release that I wrote about before.

B000P0J09C|4.0|One of my favorite genres of movies is the Vietnam War movies.  I love APOCALYPSE NOW, DEER HUNTER, and PLATOON as well.  But FULL METAL JACKET stands alone in it's on unique way.  From start to finish, there is an eerie feel/feeling to the movie that only KUBRICK can create.      FULL METAL JACKET is not my favorite Kubrick film, but it is still Kubrick nonetheless and the first part of the movie in Parris Island is one of the most memorable acts ever seen in a movie.  This part of the movie is also one of the most unforgettable and realistic exposes of Basic Military Training.    Then suddenly, the story changes to Vietnam.  This is where a lot of people are turned off from the movie, but a lot goes on during this part and Kubrick is able to portray the war in his eyes.  Though probably incorrect, still very interesting.  It really demonstrates how most people sort of lost there minds in Vietnam and didn't really care about the war, but only about each other.  TRUE UNITY.    FULL METAL JACKET is a true CONTEMPORARY CLASSIC and one of Stanley Kubrick's many masterpieces.  It stands out as one of the most unique war movies ever put on celluloid.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|Fans eagerly awaited fourth Indiana Jones installment since it was announced months and months ago.  THE (not-so) LAST CRUSADE summed things up amiably, but we all love Indy and it's always fun to tag along on his adventures with him.  THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL doesn't disapoint.  It's 1957 and the Cold War is at its height.  Indiana and his on-off sidekick Mac are captured by Russians who lead them to the government warehouse (the one the Ark was stashed at in RAIDERS) and demand that Indy finds a certain crate.  We learn that the crate contains the remains of a magnetic being.  Indy escapes and meets Mutt Williams, a young greaser played amiably by Shia LaBeuf.  Marion Ravenwood is back into the mix as well, and they all race the evil Russians (led by a very accented Cate Blanchett) to find a mythical Crystal Skull that contains unimaginable powers.    The acting is spot-on.  Harrison Ford is better than ever, doing many of his own stunts.  He punches, kicks, cracks that old whip, and sasses the Russians every chance he gets.  That's the Indy we know and love.  The action scenes are engaging and fast-paced.  The CGI is used to the film's advantage, making the climactic sequences much larger and grander.  The only downside to the film is the Area 51 tie-in that results in the plot climax surpassing all reality bounds.  I won't say much more than that for it would spoil the plot, but a second-long end sequence had me cringing because it was so silly.    Sleek and enjoyable, but could do with much less sci-fi.  Highly recommended.

0938045695|4.0|Well i thought the book was good overall.There is some good info in on a select few of the kettlebell movements. Stuff that you dont see in other places. Pavel does explain every movment to well. There could be more and some details of the lifts were forgotten. He does explain the the selected movements a little more carefully than he has in other books. But by no means are they exaustive.He just explains them with more attention. Personally I do not like the program as he lays it out but that is a personal preference as i have seen that many people do. Kettlebells have a wide array of applications and in my opinion he does not take that into account here. He focuses more on only a few exercises which you are expected to follow for a few months and beleieves that to much variety is a bad thing. To an extent i agree but too little variety is not good either. There has to be balance. There is not enough movments in my opinion. Id brather go with steve maxwell or jeff martone, now these guys are amazing and offer much better quality work. While i am saying it again the book is not bad overall, it is not the best, there is certainly better work out there on kettlbells. I will stick with steve maxwell and Jeff martones H2H drills. Good luck
0783219695|5.0|THE MOVIE:  Ron Howard's \\"Apollo 13\\" is superb.  It is also majestic, romantic, thrilling, adventurous, frightening, funny, dramatic, heartbreaking, heartwarming, heroic, and just plain wonderful.    Every single actor in the film delivers a phenomenal performance (although Chris Ellis as Deke Slayton isn't given much to work with by the script), and Howard's direction is the best it could possibly be.  I need hardly rehash the information in other reviews about the absolutely authentic recreation of the historical visual elements of the movie, or the use of NASA's KC-135 \\"Vomit Comet\\" to film most of the scenes set in weightlessness.    Some may prefer \\"The Right Stuff\\" to \\"Apollo 13\\" as a movie because it's more imaginative, but \\"Apollo 13\\" is one of the most accurate and faithful docudramas ever made about space exploration.    THE DVD:  \\"Apollo 13\\" has not one but two of the best DVD commentary tracks I have ever heard.  Ron Howard's account of the making of the movie is full of fascinating anecdotes, but even better is the commentary by Jim and Marilyn Lovell, which is simply one of the coolest bonus features ever found on a Digital Video Disc.    The Lovells' commentary is the equivalent of hearing Scarlett and Rhett comment on \\"Gone With The Wind\\", or Frodo and Sam (as distinct from Wood and Astin) discuss Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  Because the movie is so faithful to the historical record, Lovell is able to describe his own inner thoughts and feelings over big closeups of Tom Hanks (e.g., when he's watching Neil Armstrong step onto the moon).    Among the other special features on the second disc is the condensed IMAX version of the movie, which is in a different aspect ratio (one which fills the whole screen of a widescreen TV, whereas the unedited movie fills the entire width of the screen but has black bars at the top and bottom).  This version is mainly interesting as a demonstration of how an Academy Award-winning director goes about trimmingone of his masterpieces.  Some of the edits result in stronger scene transitions, but the shortening of the long take of Ken Mattingly's (Gary Sinise) reaction to learning he's been bumped from the mission is profoundly regrettable.

B000QUCNOK|3.0|Watching Perfume I found it a fascinating film up until the moment of the orgy scene.  Listening to Tom Tykwer in the \\"Making of...\\" I can believe he saw it as a metaphor for celebrity in our time. Yet the orgy and everything that followed it struck me as false. I wasn't squeamish about the bodies, though I did start wondering about the folks involved with the shooting, but it seemed to me that it was also related to the concept that the genius can break all of the rules and somehow that is excusable. The Producer says that the film is supposed to be amoral, that is without a moral compass. So in the end the overwhelming shared erotic experience somehow excuses the 13 plus girls who had to die to make this divine scent, in other words the film really winks at human sacrifice, implying that when it comes to our sexual desires nothing is more important. (This interpretation is underscored by Alan Rickman's character asking for forgivenees.)     I know the whole thing is a fable, yet it certainly does have a moral bearing: The truly gifted person is not understood and is thus excused for treating their fellow human beings execrably, if they can produce something miraculous. I would have accepted the orgy scene if they had gone all the way and ripped each other to shreds or done what \\"his people\\" do at the end, rip him to shreds and eat him. But ironically their final cannibal act is treated like a benediction in the film.     But at least Tykwer did get me thinking. I'll give it that much. But Run Lola Run is still his masterpiece.

B0012GMW7A|5.0|I've been a casual Cohen fan since BEFORE he even made music for money. When I was in college, Leonard's novel \\"Beautiful Losers\\" was a moderate hit in artsy, intellectual circles. I aspired to be in such a circle, so I read the book. Only months later did I find out that he was a singer/songwriter as well. In the past 40 years, I've only bought a few of his albums, and none in the past two decades. Last month, however, I found this one on sale for an irresistable price and plunged in. I like all the tracks. While none of the songs have the commercial appeal of his early folk hits such as \\"Suzanne\\" and \\"Bird on a Wire\\" and \\"Sisters of Mercy\\", they are all poetic, competent, pleasant, and feature Leonard in good voice. I saw Mr. Cohen in concert only once, around 1970, and while he appeared to be stoned and not aware of his surroundings, it did not affect his singing. Maybe that's just the way he handled stage fright? \\"Various Positions\\" was a bargain, for me, and will get a fair share of repeat play.
B0012BUX0I|5.0|I don't need to go into the plot line of this movie, there are plenty of reviews out there for that.<br /><br />This review is for the product.  This DVD comes direct from Amazon and is manufactured on demand by createspace, an Amazon company.  The quality of the transfer is good.  I played it on my 52 inch HDTV and it worked just fine.  The background art for the main menu was a bit grainy but it probably had to do with the size of my TV.<br /><br />I am happy with the overall quality of this production.  I give it an A.
0007263082|1.0|Honestly, I decided to read this book because I hated the movie, and I figured the book MUST be better. After the first few pages, I knew what I was getting myself into. The author is well-intentioned, and she's made a cutesy novel, but she states in her note that the manuscript was intended only for herself...it should have stayed that way. Either that, or get a decent editor. I know there are plenty of people out there who enjoy the chick novels, but I usually don't. I don't consider myself to take books too seriously, but I certainly draw the line at authors that use more than one exclamation point. (\\"Hello?!!! Holly, did you get lost?\\") Simply put, you can tell this is Cecelia's first novel.     As for the story itself, it's cute. Deceased Gerry left his wife Holly letters for her to read and to abide by after he's passed away. It's a good read for a lazy summer, but sometimes I felt like I was wasting my time as I was dragged through such unimportant scenes as dinners with mum. (As Stephen King says, if it doesn't thrust the plot forward, don't write it, and don't bother reading it.) The characters are likeable at times, but for some reason I found myself more attached to the side characters than to Holly herself (the main character). I continued to read it because, well, I'm just obsessed with reading. But also because it's a really easy read, although being an easy read can be good or bad. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a relaxing read, or to anyone who wants to take a break from wearing themselves out on a more satisfying, tiring, serious novel, as that was the case for me.     Also, as someone else mentioned in a comment, this is the same plot as the prior-made \\"The Letter.\\" Which gets you thinking.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|The Blu-ray version of this product is incredible.  The footage captured in this series is extraordinary!
0756404746|5.0|First - I appreciated very much my friend recommending Patrick Rothfuss' fantasy book, The Name of the Wind. This was by far the best read I've had in a very, very long time. The language artistry so excellent that nothing in the fantasy was jarring, even the odd, foreign words for various things were crafted in such a way that immediate reference relationships to current-day items/people/places were drawn by my mind. It flowed and was engaging and engrossing and almost addicting.    Second - I'm glad I'm done with it. I just kept wanting to read it. I ditched dinner at the table with the kids in favor of the couch with the book. I looked up and it was 4 a.m. and I wasn't nearly done reading for the night. I became unreasonably irritated when approached at lunch by co-workers, because I just wanted to read. Addicting!    Third - It's the first in a series ... and the second isn't out yet. Pre-ordered now, but not scheduled for release until April 2009! Don't do that to me, man!    Seriously, thanks to Ben for introducing me to such a GREAT read.
B00180R06I|5.0|This cinematic piece of visual poetry defies easy catagorizing. Is it a vampire film? Oh, sure, but if you merely desire a little bit(e) from the traditional DRACULA story, you will soon find yourself disappointed. It could be argued, that most of this film, is a sleepwalker's hazy recollections in the morning, or a hallucination by a skitzoid young man, instead of a surreal odyssey into the damnation of the living dead, doomed to drink blood to remain young. This main protagonist, Herr von GRAY, is a sensitive man, given to the study of occult books, fantasizing about vampires, ghosts and death. He arrives at a small, poor country Inn, and that's when all surreal HELL breaks out. The director, DREYER, was famous in the French avant guarde film world, such as it was back then, for his previous film \\"THE PASSSION OF JOAN OF ARC\\" from 1927. OH, and guess who designed the sets, and was the art director for VAMPYR? None other than Herman Warm, who designed sets for CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI, an undeniable masterpiece of German pre-WWII \\"Bauhaus\\" influenced set design. If just WARM were involved in this film, as art director, it would still be well worth seeing. Oddly enough, the director chose to work with mostly non-actors, for the authenticity.  He did use two actual actors. The lead was an actor,  a wealthy German Baron who also co-produced, and financed the film. He plays the lead man, GRAY, who entering the Inn, finds that he has entered a world of nightmares. He looks out the window, and sees a man with a scythe going on a boat. ITS THE SPECTOR OF DEATH ITSELF. Next, a man's shadow walks down the stairs outside the Inn, and sits down on a bench. Then, a man also walks up to the bench, sits down, and we realize that the SHADOW BELONGS TO THE MAN WHO JUST SAT NEXT TO IT. Then, they leave together, with the shadow reconnected to the man. SO, a land of SHADOWS is brought into vivid existence, thru clever technical effects. Another oddity to the film, is a near total lack of dialouge.  That helps the film, but having a lot of back story to read as pages flash up on the scene, one wonders why it was not given to some kind of voice over. No doubt the presence of very little dialogue throughout the film, only lends to that uneasy, dreamlike quality. Often, one is tempted to see this as a silent film, but of course, there is SOME talking going on here and there. Next a woman is seen having her blood sucked from her body. We end up reading a book with  GRAY about Vampires, and the local legend of an Evil woman who turned the whole town into vampires, before she was stopped. Extreme close-ups of the bizarre gothic wood cuts in the book, and then, a long shot thru a bookcase with a human skull once more visually brings in the leitmotif of death, and the German romantic ideal of death. Next, we have some screens of a man seen pitching hay, but the film is running backwards. Apparently, in this dream nightmare world, time and action can move backwards. All parameters of logic are ignored, and the nightmare advanced on the viewer.  Then its dark, and we are moving around outside, in dense, impenetrable fog, searching for the master vampire's grave, so they can be killed while she sleeps. This part of the film had been overexposed from light leaking into a faulty camera, but the director liked the foggy, washed out effect it gave the print, so he used it for all the outdoor shots. Yes, deliberate filming in the \\"lo-fi\\" esthetic...I loved it. So, the film goes on like this, with one part of a nightmare leading to another. One of the women in the Inn, who was bitten by the vampire, needs blood. One of the GREATEST turn arounds on the typical vampire film occurs here. Instead of your Van Helsing doctor who gives us the medical/metaphysical information to defeat the vampire, we have instead a doctor who assists the vampire in finding suitable victums. So, the duplicitious doctor bleeds Gray, in order to help save the dying young woman's life, whois really a transforming vampire, needing her first blood meal, at Gray's expense. However, this puts him into some kind of psychic link with the vampire, that nearly kills him.  Next, we see Gray sitting down, and his image splits, with a transparent doubleganger image, or his dream-spirit, going off and wandering around the inn, and the local town. By this time, even tho I have watched the movie at least three times, I start to lose the thread of whatever logic or daytime sanity I use the plot for. In fact, I can only imagine that the surrealist film Le Chien d'Andelou  influenced the Director, with the non logic of the images in relation to the movement of the film, and the unexpected, nauseating horror of some of the scenes. (Gray's bloodletting was especially creapy, mostly because of the crudeness of the hypo used to get blood. )That leads me to the most bizarre, unsettling image from the entire film. In the end, the evil Doctor who was in cahoots with the head vampire is killed. He runs, or is chased, into an old mill, filled with an impossible amount of gears and strange machinery. He flees into a cage-like chamber, that looks like an elevator shaft. He becomes locked in this fenced in little area, when the waterwheel starts up the gears, and flour from above starts to fall down upon the evil doctor. At first, he is covered with flour, and he looks like a ghost. Then, the flour slowly fills up around him, until he's buried alive far above his head in flour. Again, i can't figure out how they shot some of the last images, because it DOES look like the doctor is buried. As the images become more threatening, more surreal and disturbing, as the film unfolds, the best is saved for last. The buried alive scene, is a visual crescendo of the macabre. That image seems to unlock a very primal fear of death, for those of us who are buried whole. Premature burial is the probible basis of some of the horror surrounding the idea of the dead living..or being alive in your own tomb. So the cinematic images of death, and blood, and ghosts, disembodied souls, vampirism as a deadly disease, and premature burial just leaves you unable to shake what seems to be a nightmare. Our subconscious wakes and screams, and you try to piece the frightening images into some semblence of linear logic. But that negates the dark beauty of this film. This film belongs to the realm of night, and nightmares, of frightening, ambiguous images that function as a cinematic memento morti .  Anyway, I highly recommend this film. This new print far improves on the older DVD edition of the film  by \\"Blackhawk film\\".  They mastered off a badly damaged print, with punched out words appearing during the film's transistion between reels, and a soundtrack which was so faint and fuzzy, you might as well have been listening to a silent film. Naturally, they fixed those horrible gothic lettered subtitles, which took up a third of the scene as well. The Blackwater edition does give you a little extra, to compensate for their poor print they used to master from. It's a little piece of stop animation filmed in 1934 by a Pole, called The Mascot. Altho you wont have that, you will have what is (besides Murnau's original NOSFERATU, and Leghosli's DRACULA), one of the greatest meditations on Death, and the vampire legend, ever filmed. I'm glad Critilion restored the film, and gave it the full deluxe treatment. A word of advice, however--this film seems to grow on you. It might sink its teeth into you the first night you watch it, but it needs to feed on your subconscious, drop by drop.  After you spend a few more nights watching the film, slowly absorbing the morbid imagery, you will be hooked. Only then will the film, as all great works of art, transform you into something new.

0143038419|5.0|I have a policy about buying new books; I put it on my wish list and then if I'm still wishing for it after 6 months, I buy it.  Not many books make that cut, but this book did, and I am so very grateful that it did.<br /><br />Eat, Pray, Love is the story of a woman who put a halt to the trainwreck her personal life had become and, through three different trips/destinations over a year's time, found physical, spiritual and emotional healing.  It's a personal view of a personal 'cure'.  It's not a how-to book, although many seem to want to treat it as such.  It is an open and frank glimpse inside the authors personal psyche.<br /><br />I love that the author shares her pain, while admitting how she's addicted to the pain. For those of us who've been in destructive relationships that we couldn't find our way out of, I say kudos to the author for finding her way.<br /><br />I love how she shares her passion for Italy, the language, the food and the beauty.  I, too, am a travel junkie, and have an upcoming three-day trip to Rome (after London and Paris) that I actually wasn't looking forward to.  Now it's going to be the highlight of my trip and I can't wait start listening to those Italian language tapes and prepping myself for una grande awentura .<br /><br />I love that she shares the very hard work that meditation and spiritual seeking is, and the joy it brings to her life.  Her story of sitting still in the ashram's garden, meditating while being consumed by mosquitoes, gave me the strength and inspiration to try her stillness technique to help me fall asleep.  What a difference it made for me!<br /><br />I also love her ability to drop into a different culture, such as Bali, and bend and adapt herself to the cultural norms and societal rules without demanding that the Balinese change to fit her view of them.  (All of us who travel have been guilty of this at some point of another.)  I thank her for sharing her experience of going to a Balinese familiy ceremony and explaining how and why the women just sit in the beautiful traditional finery and admire each other.  It helped me to finally understand many of the customs I've run across when attending parties given by Indians, Asians and Latin Americans.<br /><br />I also loved her sharing about the beautiful Brazilian woman, Armenia, who felt it was her duty to take the time to make herself beautiful every day because \\"even in the worst tragedies and crisis, there's no reason to add to everyone's misery by looking miserable yourself.\\"  This said by a woman who worked for the U.N. traveling to war zones and refugee camps.  That insight makes me want to care just a bit more about how I appear to others.  No, I don't believe this is a shallow statement.  Doesn't seeing a beautiful well-dressed woman or a handsome man in a suit make you feel better about the world?  It does me.  Better than looking at someone in a torn t-shirt, showing their beer belly and buttocks.  Am I right?  It doesn't mean that I love one less that the other, I just appreciate beauty wherever I see it. That's one of the reasons I plant seasonal flowers and container gardens in my front yard; just to give people a reason to smile as they pass.<br /><br />I can't tell you that if you read this book it will change your life.  I can only tell you that it's changed mine, even if in the smallest way, and for that I will be forever grateful.  Thank you, Elizabeth Gilbert, for sharing.

B000WTLDPU|5.0|While this is a great movie and the graphics are outstanding making it seem like it might be something good for the family, it's not. It's a great movie don't get me wrong but it's not quite something the younger children need to watch.<br /><br />For a single movie it sure hits a lot of classes of film, Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Romance/Comedy/horror and I'm probably missing something in there. Movie was full of laughs, some danger here and there and you guessed it the woman/man relationship that drives the whole movie. This film is full of great actors. One of them seems to find himself a little too comfortable in his actions in the movie, you'll get the joke when you watch it.<br /><br />All in all if you like to laugh, watch Sci-Fi and can tolerate a Chic Flick undertone you'll like the movie.<br /><br />HD Quality: 5 STARS, simply great quality throughout the entire movie!<br />Sound: 4-5 stars there, great sound, I'm not running the best equpiment so I can't say all that much on it. But I will say that it didn't suck by any means.
B0014Z4ON4|3.0|A must have, to complete the triple set. The story line is interesting but seams to get lost as the movie progresses, seams as though the special effects become overkill. This is one of my least liked of the Indian Jones set, but still worth watching. I still don't get why these are not made for 16x9 wide screen TV's. So people be aware, \\"enhanced for wide screen TVs\\" does not mean you get to watch a full picture on your wide screen TVs.
0451528956|3.0|After becoming involved with a production of Jekyll & Hyde, the musical, in the local community theater, I decided to re-read the original novel by Stevenson.  In the book Jekyll/Hyde admits that he had no honorable motive for the transformations (other than curiosity). In the musical he is experimenting to develop a treatment or cure for his father's mental illness. Also, in the book there are no major female characters like the fiancee, dance hall girl(s), etc.  If you are familiar with the Broadway show the original book might be a disappointment, but read it anyway. It is a classic and the commentaries at the beginning and the end of the edition for sale on Amazon.com effectively put the cultural signifcance of the plot of the novel into perspective.
1416562591|5.0|One of the few books I've read that I've hated to finish. Funny, sordid, in places, and violent, not just of \\"questionable morality\\" as the jacket cover states,the book is an alternative to decorative ideas of the beauties of Indian culture and offers insights into a servant's life and its attendant frustrations. The important thing, however, is the writer's skill in projecting memorable prose. The clever device of using first person, addressing a fictional Chinese official is notable. A very pleasurable read and a page turner, to boot. I would highly recomment it, although perhaps one would enjoy it much more if one had prior acquaintance with Indian culture.
B0014KD46W|5.0|This new CD from Steve Winwood is refreshing and dynamic.  I find it more inspiring than some of his previous works.  Winwood takes a tune and with his velvety and heartfelt voice adds soulful excitement to it.  If you don't know or like blues or jazz, even rock music, you may begin to appreciate them after listening him.  This CD comes with amazing clarity and transparency.  You feel like clapping with him, or if you play any instrument you can be tempted to grab it and play with him.  It is inviting, presented in open space, a clean and very uplifting music.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|This is an exceptional mix of dance, pop and world music, with a couple of well-written ballads thrown in the mix. Summer's voice is as strong as ever. Standouts include the title track (a toe-tapper that you can't get out of your head after hearing it once) and Walking Down Brazil.
B000002C2E|3.0|Time Out of Mind is an agitated album, a sweaty and broken and bruised mess of a record, a terrified mongrel hiding, battered in a filthy corner. Desperation saturates and haunts it, and clogs its arteries and twists its nerves and blows smoke into its corridors, and fear burns its edges and memory tarnishes it. It's a miserable album, a soul murdered. It may seem perverse, but that's actually praise. Think about it: sometimes, misery seems to be our only companion. Sometimes we feel alone and helpless and scared, miles from anything warm or redeeming. Sometimes, hope is a joke and love is a vicious lie. Sometimes, we're staring into the abyss and as it opens up at as, as it grows wider and deeper, grabs at us. It's good to have music that reflects that, right? I mean, isn't Exile On Main Street a masterpiece because it does pretty much the same thing?    Well, sort of. Time Out Of Mind does indeed get points for its pitch-perfect articulation of desperation and loss. It loses points for pretty much the same reason. It loses points because it doesn't offer an ounce of hope, because it takes the low road and simplifies all of the humanity of our darkest moments. It's an album that whispers into your ear, \\"yes, you're right to be sad. Things aren't going to get any better.\\" This hopelessness is the album's central conceit, and the result is a painfully one-dimensional listening experience. The greatest works of musical depression (the aforementioned Rolling Stones album, as well as such other classics as The Queen Is Dead and Dylan's own Blood On The Tracks) were masterpieces because they found a way to channel personal anguish into a sense of liberation- The Queen Is Dead did it by being poetic, Exile On Main Street did it by being ridiculously fun, and Blood On The Tracks did it by reveling in the overwhelming redemptive power of love, successful or otherwise. Time Out Of Mind just mopes. It's emotional sludge, a dull crawling slab of misery-for-misery's own sake. It doesn't offer hope or catharsis. It just asks you to wallow, to drift.     Three stars for effectively conveying that state of mind, for its bluesy textures and claustrophobic production, and for the tense, ominous \\"Highlands.\\" Chalk up the less-than-perfect rating to its exhausting miserabalism and relentless melodrama.

B000ZOXDG4|4.0|to me, cate blanchett is one of ten english-speaking actresses that could croak the abcs and i would buy a ticket for it. so, i didn't find my way to 'elizabeth: the golden age' for a history lesson.  likewise, i'm not an anglophile and have some feeling that the english have done some really funky things in the name of their queen.  but that aside, i have nothing but admiration for blanchett's second take on the virgin queen under kapur's fanciful direction.<br /><br />blanchett and kapur made their chapters in the queen's life a romantic, lush film with hints of political intrigue accompanied by stunning visual and design effects (the watching eyes of the ladies in waiting as elizabeth and sir dudley make love turning in to prints of eyes on her drapes is still so wist ful and enchanting).  kapur was also able to give screen time to more than a few actors like daniel craig.  craig is now the british flavor du jour.  not to mention kelly macdonald and emily mortimer as two of elizabeth's ladies in waiting and the wonderful kathy burke as queen mary.<br /><br />now the visuals are just as stunning--and from what i gather as anachronistic--as before.  alexandra byrne's costumes are even more sumptuous than before and very worthy of their academy award.  and geoffrey rush is on hand again as elizabeth's advisor and he is even more authoritative.<br /><br />and as for cate--she is just as magnificent as she was before.  now she is power incarnate as she presses through the cavernous sets in her array of silks and brocades.  and she has more than a few moments of vulnerability as she watches her favorite lady bess dance with her favorite lord, sir walter raleigh and relives when she was younger.  her last night talks with her lady bess are also warm and filled with many depths.<br /><br />now i wish that the score could have been a little more right and less a wash of strings and whatnot that make up the standard historical epic score.  and even though it may or may not be a huge part of british history, i would like to have seen more of samantha morton.  after all, she is a very good actor and mary, queen of scots is a very good role.<br /><br />it would have been too much to expect blanchett to take many (if any) awards for this performance but the work still stands strong--even if it's not buoyed up by statuettes.ry, i would like to have seen more of samantha morton.  after all, she is a very good actor and mary, queen of scots is a very good role.    it would have been too much to expect blanchett to take many (if any) awards for this performance but the work still stands strong--even if it's not buoyed up by statuettes.
B00013BN4S|5.0|This 1975 debut album covers alot of ground, from the traditional country of Merle Haggard to uptempo country rock and even a Beatles song. But it is all brought together by Harris' dedication to making honest music that defies narrow genres or stereotypes.     Like her former beau, Gram Parson, Emmylou also unites traditional sounds with a rock and roll sensibility. Thus making her a pioneeer of the sort of music that has come to be called \\"Americana\\" or \\"alternative country\\". But, whatever the label, Harris' emphasis has always been on making great music and she has continued to be one of the best until the present day.     The first songs on this album are my favorites, including the winsome \\"If I Could Only Win Your Love\\" and the gorgeous \\"Before Believing.\\" I also love \\"Boulder To Birmingham\\" and it's lyrical power makes me wonder why Emmylou wasn't doing more song writing at this point in her career.    The band is excellent throughout and includes such standout musicians as James Burton on electric guitar and Ricky Skaggs on fiddle and viola. This is a great album. Check it out!
6304698526|4.0|The movie was great. My only complaint was that no matter what I did to the setting on my TV or DVD player, I got the dreaded black bars on the top and bottom of the screen.  This was a big disappointment for me. I bought the WS version because I have a WS TV.    A Disappointed Steve McQueen fan
B00001PE4D|4.0|I didn't expect much from this film.  I just picked it out of curiosity, and to my surprise, I enjoyed this movie.  It was better than I thought.  I felt watching a movie version of Gossip Girl.  I am always fascinated by high society, and with all that power, how it can affect one's life.    The movie does have subtle message, but for me, it was jut about learning the art of seduction. :)      Pretty cool.
1416523359|5.0|Sorry to disagree with all the critics. This is my favorite single Stephen King novel, though in some parts of the Dark Tower series his imagination shines as brilliantly. The book seems to get off to a slow start, but I later appreciated the meandering pace as a way of heightening the anticipation and suspense. For me, the book was excellent because of the way King created vibrant, living images out of deeply personal human concerns that are invisible but affect us deeply. For instance: the \\"bad gunky\\" is that indefinable substance (or condition) that makes monsters out of fathers and mothers, siblings and friends. Weirdly, some \\"bad gunky\\" emerged in a personal relationship while reading the book. Then you have that ephemeral world of imagination (Boo'ya Moon), always beautiful, always captivating and soothing, but sometimes hypnotic in its power to entrance. I love the symbolism here, showing imagination as a real place with both healing and harmful elements. And finally, the passionate love between a woman and her man is deepest where pain and hurt are not ignored, but embraced. How can I not love a book that helps to flesh out these fascinating concepts?
B0010ZR160|5.0|A compelling story that may cause the viewer to ask 'what would I have done in the end?'. A selfish, rotten mother lies about events surrounding her missing daughter. At first the case appears drug related, since the situation for the child was in dire need of welfare intervention, but when the young girl's aunt brings in a P.I. familiar with the neighborhood and its bad guys, the case gets far more complicated.  As the P.I. digs deeper he's soon faced with a complicated question of right and wrong, only the question of what's right is anything but simple. The real sad fact is there are parents out there that are like the mother character so superbly played in this movie, so it's not difficult to sympathize with a few well-meaning characters who thought they were doing the right thing.  This one will make you think.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Dexter is surprisingly like-able kind of guy. I find myself rooting for him even though he is a severely disturbed serial killer. The story content is well written and before you know it, you gotta see what's going to happen next.  Excellent Adult entertainment.

B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I originally tried to listen to this album all the way through late at night as I was falling asleep and the first thirty seconds of 'The Rip' originally had me feeling like I was slipping into a bizarre waking dream. It was too overwhelming and I had to stop there. 'Machine Gun' which I heard on their myspace page originally turned me off and I didn't know what to expect but now that I've given the album a chance to soak into my mind I fully appreciate what Portishead has accomplished here. They've evolved and yet still retained the essence of what attracted me to them in the first place - introspection, originality, unpredictability and integrity. The lyrics are phenomenal and I challenge you to find poetry like this anywhere else in music these days. Admittedly, it will  not be easy to get into if you are not a substantial Portishead fan to begin with. However, if you are not a big fan but like to be challenged give it a chance and discover a work of genius. The last minute or so of the final track...wow...such an amazing commentary on our current world situation. Sure, the trip hop feel is largely gone with the wind but still there are so many intricate layers here, and so many different interpretations. That is one thing that hasn't changed. The best three of 'Third' in my opinion are:    The Rip  Small  Threads
B00133KFGW|4.0|Great movie but why put a four letter word in this? Could of been a great movie for all ages, what were they thinking.
B0016LTNL4|1.0|I suppose this type of humor isn't for me as I barely cracked a smile throughout the course of the entire movie.  This movie presents you with uncomfortable situations and expects you to laugh nervously.
B000000WG4|2.0|Going through the reviews of Bells, I am particularly surpised by the irritation caused by the vocal bit on side two - The so called Klingon vocal. Well people, you simply have no imagination. I've always liked that bit. When it came, me and a friend of mine always had lots of fun, because we envisioned a little dwarf being chased by a pack of wolves. The little dwarf runs for his life, hindered by a full belly due to too much eating and drinking at a party the previous night. He has to puke constantly. Every now and then, he has to stop and lean against a tree to empty his stomach. That's where the SHLAUUUGHHH! noise comes from. meanwhile, you can hear the wolves, who are gaining on him, howl in the background.  By the way, Bells doesn't interest me much. It's a mosaic of little ideas and not particularly interesting melodies. Doesn't take a genius to put together. But, granted, Oldfield would prove his uncommon craftmanship years later, with Incantations and Amarok.

0307387178|5.0|Chris was not a wing nut like some parts of the movie portray. He was kid tired of societies crap, the pressure to have an education to become someone. He proved education doesn't make you happy, it's the adventure life shows you that will. Even know he died a young man, I completely relate to him and his need to venture off solo and find out who he is! I spent many summers as my father did in his youth taking trips by myself in the wilderness. People thought I was crazy, but I understand and appreciate the simple things in life because of it. It helped me figure out what I wanted in life. If Chris would have made it out alive he would have been a success in what ever he attempted. He studied life and what made him and others happy within themselves. For one kid to make such an impact on the people he met while he traveled he had to have been enjoying life to the fullest. This book is an inspiration to anyone looking to find out what makes them tick. Great Book!

0060899190|5.0|I've been a fan of the PostSecret site for awhile now.  It's a project started by Frank Warren back in late 2004 involving blank postcards.  He spread them around and asked people to share a secret on the card, decorate it as they saw fit, and then mail it anonymously to him.  In short order, the project took on a life of its own, and Warren started receiving cards and letters from around the world.  The book PostSecret: Extraordinary Confessions from Ordinary Lives is a full-color compilation of some of these mailings, and it's fascinating.<br /><br />Behind the cover of anonymity, people are willing to 'fess up to numerous things that are dark secrets never before revealed.  Going through the book, you see secrets such as \\"He's been in prison for two years because of what I did.  9 more to go.\\", \\"I wish my parents could see me for what I am, instead of what I didn't become.\\", and \\"I am contemptuous of others so it hurts less then they are indifferent to me.\\"  The words themselves can be funny, haunting, sad, or shocking, but the real impact is the artwork that adorns the cards.  It's there that you get the full emotional impact of what the writer is saying.  For instance...  A \\"Hello, My name is...\\" tag with the space filled in as \\"I force new acquaintances to address me by my shortened name because it makes me forget my past.\\".  Or there's the picture of the wrecked car with the hand-written note \\"I almost decided not to get out, once I knew I'd hit the river.\\"<br /><br />Not all the items are as dark as what I've noted above.  There's \\"I believe in destiny, and I think I know mine.  :) :) :)\\", \\"I had a cyst on my face that ruined 7th and 8th grade.  Now I love it because it makes me different.\\", and my favorite (written on a Starbucks cupholder)...  \\"I give decaf to customers who are RUDE to me!\\"<br /><br />I guess part of the fascination with PostSecret is the lurid stuff that shows up.  But it's also a reminder that what you see on the outside of someone is in all likelihood far different than what they see on the inside.  It once again reminds me that everyone is struggling with something in their lives.<br /><br />There are other books in the PostSecret series, and I have them on hold at the library.  This book was excellent in a thought-provoking way, and I look forward to more.erent than what they see on the inside.

0452289963|5.0|This book is outstanding! Life changing!  We already know how special a book is when it is featured on the Oprah show. This book does not disappoint.  Some may say that it's a bunch of new age mumbo jumbo, but if you read with an open mind you will gain much needed (and truly surprising) insight, awareness, and wisdom. Remember, change your thoughts, change your life!

B000VNMMR0|5.0|The original 'Die Hard' film is the quintessential action movie. The first two sequels are very entertaining, but couldn't possibly live up to the original. 'Live Free or Die Hard' is a worthy entry in the series and the best since the original. Willis is in fine form and Justin Long proves he can hold his own. Fantastic action sequences and a tight story line will keep you on edge from beginning to end. The single disc unrated release has the theatrical release included as well as the unrated version. There is enough extra stuff on this one to keep me happy, but a two disc is available for \\"DIE HARD\\" super-fans. ;-b
1563899426|3.0|Fairy Tale characters are thrust into the real world due to demonic invaders destroying thier homelands and the cabal are forced to co-exist in modern day New York. Initially, I thought this would be more tongue in cheek and along the lines of Shrek, Hoodwinked and Enchanted. This is more sophisticated and adult oriented. It's smart and it's clever and just when you think that you have found a loophole Willingham has a logical explanation. For example non-human legends live in a place called \\"The Farm\\" and former crimes from Bluebeard and the Big Bad Wolf (now human) are protected under a general amnesty. But there is no emotional hook and I found myself pre-occupieid trying to figure out who everybody was. However that tends to be a typical shortcoming when introducing a new series, particulalry in a comic. I'm curious to see what the next volume has to offer and judging by the length of the series and the strength of the writing, this doesn't seem to be a one trick pony. But I don't see myself dusting this one off and re-reading this from time to time like I would Gaiman or Moore.
061891868X|5.0|The human mind suspended in unfathomable mystery is inevitably entangled in its webs of reason.     To illustrate: In his discussion of symmetry breaking (Chapter 4), Smolin states that \\"Much of the structure of the world, both social and physical, is a consequence of the requirement that the world, in its actuality, break symmetries present in the space of possibilities. An important feature of this requirement is the trade-off between symmetry and stability.\\" However, this argument is circular: symmetries are unstable because they are broken and they're broken because they're unstable. How does the choice to break symmetries originate?
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|There wouldn't be any since in going on and on about how good this cd is ! Madonna,  once again has  top production.. only this time  by people we are familiar with. She has always went and found a new sound and developed it with innovative finesse. Madonna has also dipped in hip hop once before in 1994 with \\"Bedtime Stories\\". At that time she worked with the top noch hip hop R&B producers  \\"Dallas Austin & BabyFace\\". These guys were known for their work with the Multi platinum trio TLC. \\"Bedtime Stories\\" was the album that brought me to the table with her music and I never left.  Every since then I have been impressed with every change and development she has made. My favorite producers that she has worked with in the past were Dallas Austin (Bedtime Stories, Mirwais (American Life & Music) and  William Orbit (Ray of Light). Like I said before as much as I love this dream collaboration on this album. Madonna has always paved her own way which I feel this is no different. Even though these guys are familiar I am certainly glad she finally collaborated with them. I have been a long time fan of Timbaland and the Neptunes for about 12 years now  and have followed them closely. To be honest, they are the only people in the mainstream that I feel are own her same level.      \\"Confessions\\" was a great album and had a very ambient feel too it just like \\"Ray of Light\\". \\"Hard Candy\\" is a masterpiece in it's own right full of singles and innovative beats. The standouts easily on this album are, Devil wouldn't recognize you, Miles Away, Incredible and Heartbeat. \\"Devil\\" is a clear indication of Justin Timbertlake's past work like \\"Cry Me River\\" and \\"My Love\\". \\"Miles Away\\" is like a better version of \\"Love profusion\\" on 2003's American life. The rest of the album is just really really fun and electronic. \\"Dance tonight\\" would remind you of TLC or Prince which everyone you prefer? I also like the last song \\"Voices\\" which definitley reminds you of a Prince song. I love the album and I think it was about time she got back into hip hop again. It had been nearly 15 years since her last venture into it. Madonna, keep up the good work and thanks for keeping your ear to the street ! No one in the industry at your age has managed to stay innovative and Fresh ! For those that like this record you may want to get \\"Bedtime Stories\\" to refresh your memory of her earlier venture into hip hop R&B. This album is definitley above the rest of todays music. If you like this you may want to check out Britney Spears last unnoticed venture. It was actually a innovative album also that lost momentum due to her bad press. Music is so bad today it is a breath of fresh air to hear a album full of singles or potential singles. I do listen to alot of different types of music. This is definitley not coming from someone with a myopic point of view. Commercial music has went to the dogs in my opinion. I prefer Indie or European music for the most part but I have to honestly say Madonna has never disappointed me which is a good thing. If you go to my profile you will see what I mainly listen too. I will say that \\"Portishead's THird\\" horribly disappointed me after 10 years. I haven't  written a review yet... I was so disappointed.       No complaints Here !    A+
B0015FHDRW|4.0|Hey folks...this is not a sequel to their MASTERPIECE, but it is wonderful, catchy, summer music. The songs all sounded good on first play, and better on the second. I have no doubt that by the 3rd play it will be a summer staple (along with The Beach Boys and the Chili Peppers). I'm a young 55 and I will tell you American Idiot fans, you can't lose on this one!
B000MQC9H4|2.0|I had wanted to see this movie when it came out. I liked all the actors in it and the plot sounded like fun--not. The Kate Winslet/Jack Black and Eli Wallach sub-plot, saved the movie, that's who the 2 stars are for.    Cameron Diaz, who I normally like was terrible as was Jude Law. This is not romance. Dragging a drunken stranger to use for sex, that is not romantic and yet people think this is good. The whole relationship with these 2 ruined the movie. Sorry I don't root for loose women and her over-acting was terrible to boot. I felt no chemistry between them whatsoever.    The Kate Winslet story was sweet. She was a much better person, as was Jack Black. I heard people knocking Jack down for his straight bit, they should have been knocking Jude and Cameron for their performance and this miserable script for them.    Eli Wallach was superb. He added much to the movie. It was so sweet.    I'm with the reviewer who called it \\"Tainted Love\\". If they had built up a relationship with those two, maybe it could have amounted to something, but loose sex with a strange drunk is NOT charming and either was Cameron's arm's flapping.    And this was a Holiday movie? Isn't that special?
B000CNFC76|5.0|Can a movie about golf be that good? I wondered that too--until I watched it. It is more than \\"that good.\\" While it's no Chariots of Fire, it's has the same genes. Rich, inspiring, motivating, and even family-friendly. That's a rare combination. It's about virtues such as working toward a goal you believe in, tenacity, courage, and humility. It's about integrity. It won't necessarily make you want to play golf; but it may make you want to take the high road through life. Worth owning.
B00006AVRK|5.0|This was one of the best purchases I have ever made. Jeeves and Wooster will always cheer me up. Both actors are marvelous and their zany friends are too. Hugh Laurie is one talented man, as is Stephen Fry.  Go to youtube and check it out there. But if you are a Hugh Laurie fan, you should like this. He is the opposite of his \\"House\\" character and ever so lovable. Stephen Fry as Jeeves, the man-servant, is incredible.  Just love it!!   The scenery and clothing are beautiful also. Wodehouse was a genius and the man who put this together for tv was incredible!!

B000Y2WAKM|5.0|Mark Everett is an amazing artist who writes lyrics that actually mean something and accompanies them with creative, inspiring music played on everything from the saw to the Wurlitzer organ to the bass guitar. I wish for him commercial success, yet I don't because I hope he continues to hold to his principles to make the music that speaks to him rather than what speaks to the masses and the record companies. This is an outstanding collection of music.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|All I have to say is that I'm not a huge Madonna fan, but I absolutely LOVE this CD. I haven't stopped listening to it for about a month now and I don't think I'm going to stop any time soon. SO worth the money!!

B00000DR5I|5.0|Tangerine Dream at its best. I discovered TD with Stratosfear and Rubycon.  With these two albums I became a huge fan for life of electronic space experimental rock music. Stratosfear is more rock than Rubycon.  Rubycon is a journey into space. The evolution of the melody is subtle and it slowly captivates your sense. Next thing you know, you are in the middle of an asteroid field with a strong rhythmic foundation. Listening to Rubycon while driving on the highway is the most relaxing musical experience ever.  It brings me back to the 70s, in a good way.  Thirty years later, I find TD's music as classic as it was avant-garde then, and I cannot be anymore grateful for the legacy they have left behind for us to enjoy.  When music like that of Rubycon moves me, I feel as if in the presence of God.  Sublime!

B0013FBTHO|4.0|Great film and one I thought would sparkle in the quality of HD!    Unfortuanately the quality is that high you can clearly see the painted billboards that are meant to represent the deserted buildings (McDonalds appears clearly painted)!    Apart from that it is a good film and the alternative ending is interesting to watch but convinces you that they went for the right one of the two in the end!  Still worth a watch!

0446402389|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  If Tom Smith can write a first novel as good as this one I can't wait for a second one.  I have three pet peeves about novels. 1) The lead, be male or female is always the smartest person in the world and/or a superman/woman. 2)Authors who write a 200 page novel crammed into 500 pages just to assure enough sex, violence, and usless word fill. And 3)Looong draaaawn out endings. Tom Smith managed to avoid all three of these and wrote an exciting top flight novel to boot. This is the first five star rating I have ever given an author and he definitely deserves it.

B00111YM5G|5.0|I'm easy to please. You won't find me sitting here critiqueing movies on every single detail. So if you're not someone who gets too serious about all the little things, then read on.    I really liked this movie. I thought the acting was good, and it's right up my line of action, love, and darkness. I think people should give this movie a try. And if you like it, try Equilibrium next. That's a really good one too!
192076920X|3.0|Oddly, all the reviews here describe the book accurately, both the positive and negative ones.  Most however make, to me, the mistake of taking the book seriously.  Yes it is unbelievable, and the author has romanticized himself as he wishes to be in some super hero flick, but so what?  He does it skillfully, and the reading goes quickly, or else even the negative reviewers would not have read all of it.  As light weight books go, this is a lot better than most.  Think sort of an attempt to imitate Don Quixote, only that isn't fair to this book, because of course it does not come close.  But the continuously flowing sequence of unbelievable but entertaining events is in the same genre.  Don't pan it as a bad serious novel or memoir, but as an unusually good light entertainment story.  I read it out of order to stay interested, first pages 1-100, then bored I skipped to page 400 or so, then back, and so on.  Im on vacation and glad to have it along.

B0000542D2|5.0|I bought this movie on DVD because my 21 year old son who enjoys the Beatles music wanted to see it.  I had seen it when it first came out in theaters and thought it would be fun to see it again. This movie holds up so well.  It is still as fun to watch as it was 40 years ago.  The Beatles shine through as funny, engaging entertainers.  You get to see a bit of their personalities as they are not playing \\"characters\\" but themselves.  It is done as a mock \\"documentary\\" in a typical day in their lives but it is light and fun to watch.  Their musical performances are great and you get a glimpse of George Harrison's future wife Pattie Boyd as one of the school girls on the train.  John and Ringo are particular stand outs in this movie but George also has some fun scenes.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to see why Beatlemania existed.  Classic entertainment!
B0013V33DG|5.0|Our parents had Joan Sutherland and Pavarotti  who both sounded wonderful in Bel Canto operas like this but just looked like big opera singers in costume, not a half-wild young girl and a love-struck lad. Consequently the singing was a joy but the humour was laboured. Not in this revised production of La Fille du Regiment (updated, very successfully, to World War I.) Nathalie Dessay started life as an actress and it shows. The comedy is broad but believable and how that tiny body can produce such sound is a wonder. Florez appears to have lost the weight he put on in the earlier DVD of Laurent Pelly's production (in which he appeared with Patrizia Ciofi) and it hasn't hurt his voice one bit. The nine high Ds in 'Ah mes Amis' ring out effortlessly and like Dessay he takes well to comedy without mugging. Donizetti's music is glorious, Dawn French fits in well with the rest of the cast in her non-singing role and Felicity Palmer, while slightly more old-school than the rest, wisely leaves the physical comedy to Dessay. Everybody seems to understand the humour is as much in the situations as the way they're played so nothing seems forced or out of place. This is the production I would show to people who thought they couldn't like opera.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|I just did not care for the film at all.  It was very strange and a bit odd.  It was Sci Fi gone wild.
B0015FHDRW|4.0|Remember how fun \\"Dookie\\" was? The band didn't take themselves too seriously (the first single dealt with the pros and cons of masturbation!) and the energy on the album, despite the close cribbing of the Clash (with a little Ramones thrown in for good measure), was infectious.  Flash way forward, and of course I was a fan of American Idiot, but also recognized that some of the songs were a bit too serious and heavy-handed.  This Foxboro Hot Tubs album is a great side project...SO much fun to blast in your car, really nicely done retro-production, with lots of little nods to the great bands of the 50's and 60's...sure, there's other bands out there that do this stuff, but Green Day has done it quite well here.  This one was worth every penny.
1577314808|3.0|I rather liked the Question and Answer format of the book.  It provided a good transition to further explain some of the concepts.  But I was disappointed that the practical application was lacking.  If I can't use these concepts everyday, and know how to apply them in specific situations, they aren't very helpful.  One example is \\"All you need to do is end the delusion of time.\\" Huh?  How do you incorporate this in your day to day activities? And don't forget to pick up your kids at school at 3:30 and file your tax return by April 15th, whenever that might be in this delusional world.
B000TO0TCQ|1.0|A great adventure. I can not stop reading it. I love the other alex rider books also i have all of them.
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|Mystic River begins with great promise. It is photographed excellently with great overhead shots and scene blocking. The viewer is delivered straight into the scene of a horrifying child abduction and it is hard not to share empathy and/or trauma with the onscreen characters.About 30 yrs after the abduction we witness takes place is when the real story begins- a story of three neighborhood friends, one the shell shocked survivor of the earlier abduction (Tim Robbins), one a Boston homicide detective (Kevin Bacon)and one a former thug turned local shop owner (Sean Penn).      When Sean Penns late teen daughter is murdered, the three former buddies are reunited in the gritty Boston neighborhood of their chidhood.  There are some great moments here- director Clint Eastwood recreates the shock and disbelief that comes with unspeakable tragedy very well and he does an excellent job illustrating a fathers trauma and the very sad and surreal hours after the initial murder.    Mystic River failed me several ways. For such a compelling opening and build-up you will likely be disappointed by the plot turns the script takes. Implausible chains of events, past relations and a \\"perfect storm\\" timeline that confuses investigators. If the plot is examined realistically (Occams Razor anyone?) it becomes improbable and something more suited for a Cinemax straight-to-video erotic thriller. Minus the erotic of course.    Film budget and maybe more could have been saved by shooting Mystic River without the three big stars in the three big roles. Unknown or little know talents could have brought more credibility to the roles, particularly of Sean Penns New England tough guy act that wears thin and Tim Robbins basket case abuse victim who is good at affecting the facial expression of a damaged and lost soul but little else. Again, casting botches by trying to push the \\"versatility\\" of the leads when they could have made a better film even with known entities like Denis Leary or Chazz Palmenteri.    There are some great support roles. Marcia Gay Harden is first rate as the troubled wife of a troubled man whose inner fears and loyalty clash with every move of her eyes.Laurence Fishburne is very buyable as Kevin Bacons homicide detective partner who provides a certain clarity because of his lack of connection to the neighborhood crime scene. Eastwood does wrap things up nicely, though , with a couple of well acted/directed scenes that are very thought provoking despite the plot defects.    Flawed, but still worth a look.
B000ZN802W|5.0|If anyone would dare give this heartwarming, heartrending, beautifully shot movie a bad review - they have no heart.    Sean Penn's Into The Wild is a tour-de-force in showcasing a real-life young man's desire to lose himself into the wilds of Alaska. Although he comes from a wealthy family, and is college educated, young McCandless finds a soul-searing pull that no one understands - but himself.    An unwavering desire to leave civilization behind, due in part to his families morbid background while growing up, but with a strong bond of love from his sister, young McCandless still feels the need to find his destiny in the Alaskan wilderness.    Beautifully shot in fantastic locations, Sean Penn also captures much more of the human heart in this strong, although somewhat tragic tale of the human spirit. I felt the highs and lows of this young man's journeys, from finding people to help heal, to finding first love in the strangest of places, this movie will take viewers on a journey of one young man's self-discovery, filling the vacuums of different people's hearts, and in various beautiful ways, that anyone with half a heart can't help but feel.    Sean Penn truly captured on film the raw emotions that lie within us all. The beauty, and the beast that lies just under the surface, but which few of us truly understand, nor usually act upon.    Into the Wild is a masterpiece in so many ways: from its acting to its cinematography, it is a true portrait of a young man's life that few people can truly call upon themselves to actually do that they most desire to dream about - leave the thin veneer of civilization behind and lose themselves into the beautiful but deadly landscapes of the wild.    This remarkable film deserves every penny and accolade it got. Actually, it deserved much, much more. A film like this is rarely made, actually able to capture the raw essence of numerous people's lives of all its wide varieties.     If the ending of this film doesn't draw strong emotion in you, full of its tragic but beautiful way, then you truly do not know what it means to be human.    After seeing this film, Sean Penn has proven to me he is as good - if not better - than such huge directors such as Spielberg and the like.    A must see for people who really should honor this fantastic young man's life.
B0019J1JXI|5.0|This is Summer's most creative project since the release of \\"Bad Girls\\"!    I sat back and waited before posting my review because, I wanted to see what others had to say, and take some time to give this CD a good listen. I didn't want to hastily post a review and base it on the fact that I have been a fan for thirty-two years. I wanted to be honest and objective. By the way, do I get a prize for being a fan that long? I sure do...this CD.    After hours of careful listening, this CD is fabulous! The title fits too because, this is Donna Summer's most colorful effort yet. It's fun, fun, fun! My congratulations to everyone involved on this project. Especially, the writers and producers. Alot of creativity here. La Donna's voice is strong and unmistakably sincere. It shines! It's very easy to tell that she really enjoyed recording these songs. Nothing sounds forced or obligated. I can't tell you how good that feels, as the listener, to pick up on that. This album is energetic, fresh, and diverse. There is something for everyone. Actually, this CD plays more like a hits compilation, rather than an individual album. I love the Reggae beat of the \\"Crayons\\" track, which happens to be a highlight on this album for me. Then, there's the hot Latin rhythms on \\"I'm A Fire\\". Lastly, another highlight for me, is \\"Bring Down The Reign\\". The African rhythms and uplifting vocals close this album nicely. I am also pleased that there are inspirational messages here as well. We are at a time in our lives when we need songs to inspire us and make us feel good. Songs to help us forget the horrors of our daily lives, and help us to escape for a little while. Throughout my entire life, the music of Donna Summer has helped me to do that.    Yes, it's a pop album. Yes, it's a bit electronic and similar to what other artists are doing today. This is where we are now...the land of computers. Yet, it works great! This has to be the feel good album of the year! Donna proves, once again, that she can do anything. I give her alot of credit for always being able to re-invent herself. You have to if you're going to survive in this business. This is why I get such a big kick out of the song \\"Fame(The Game)\\", on this CD. The lyrics couldn't be more true! Some fans are concerned about how well some of these songs will come off live? I say - no problem. Why? Because she's done it before. Does anyone remember the Munich Machine? Hence the word, Machine? Quite a few of Donna's earlier hits were all electronic. Hello? \\"I Feel Love\\"? Works well for me with a live band! The music industry is not what it used to be. There is nothing more I like better than the real thing. In fact, this album could've used one power ballad - rich with saxaphone. Ahhh. Anyhow, my point is, this is what's hot right now. No matter how the sound is created, it's still music. And I love it! However, you should purchase the actual CD. The gorgeous photos of Donna are worth the price alone! Otherwise, you can view them on her website.    Again, alot of talent and creativity here. Let's all have a good time and be thankful that Donna is still workin' hard for the money! Peace.
B0010X745K|1.0|This movie was okay at best the majority of it was okay but the ending is an absolute downer. So bad you not only want your 2 hours back but your contemplating suicide. If you are not a heartless person and you have children I do not WOULD NOT recommend this movie. It made me vomit from the heartless ending.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Great entertainment. Great performance. Great film. Includes the deleted scenes which makes better sense of things. Two thumbs up to Peter Jackson, and of course J.R.R. Tolkien for this great piece of work.
B00169XU8I|5.0|I bought the special edition box set, LOVE IT! THIS AN AN EXCELLENT CD! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE! cant wait for the remix versions!!!!
B0013FDM7E|3.0|The movie was graphically pretty.  The CG was much better than many movies I have seen, but still not the best.  The shots of abandoned NY are great.  Will Smith does very well in the movie.  Really, I was loving this movie until about 30 minutes from the end...    Then it all changed.  The ending was terrible in my opinion and after getting more info about the book this was based on, I cannot contemplate why they would make the changes they do.  This movie quickly degenerated into a zombie movie, and there are much better zombie movies out there.  This movie actually had more in common with 28 Days Later than it did with the book, and 28 Days Later was a far superior plot in my eyes.  Really the only thing that saves this movie is Hollywood money and Will Smith.  See 28 Days Later for basically the same plot line, only better.  Had they stuck to the book I think I would have enjoyed I Am Legend much more.
B000T45C32|5.0|This is a great science-fiction movie with almost no special effects.  It's set in a near future with pervasive genetic discrimination, and you feel Vincent's frustration as a \\"natural\\" with little hope of achieving his dream of spaceflight.  Despite the lack of effects and action sequences that drive a lot of SF movies, Gattaca had me on the edge of my seat!
B000RF7XYO|5.0|Elizabeth and Elizabeth the Golden Age are 2 excellent movies.  Cate Blanchett does an excellent job of being the \\"red haired\\" queen.  The story line is excellent.
B00005JM02|3.0|I saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out, along with some friends and their six-year old son... By the end of the film, the kid was crying and visibly shaken, and my wife and I practically felt the same way.  I recently vetted the film for a four-year old, and decided my first impression was right: this isn't a good movie for really little kids to watch.    \\"Finding Nemo\\" is a very intense film, both thematically and visually.  The script is clever, but it works mostly on an adult level, and most little kids will probably experience the movie on a much more basic, gut level - the rapid-fire dialog will zoom over their heads, while the images and action may terrify them. And once the action starts, it hardly lets up for a second -- the film is a rollercoaster ride of anxiety and peril, \\"Bambi\\" to the Nth degree.      Which isn't to say it's not entertaining, intelligent or well made... It is, but I would strongly caution people with very young children to think twice before showing them this movie. It's really more appropriate for an older audience, maybe eight years of age and older...Younger than that and it may just be too scary. (ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)
0061245097|5.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to buy this book at first, since I liked the first one, I liked Bones, but wasn't sure the romance was enough for me.  It read more like Urban Fantasy to me, with all the fighting.  I must say, it is more Urban Fantasy, but Bones, Bones, Bones!  He rules the book.  There is a scene where he completely alphas out on Cat, and it is fantastic.  The vamp gives me tingles.  Very good followup and a great addition to the series.    I also just realized who Bones reminds me of - Clayton in Kelley Armstrong's \\"Bitten\\".  Bones has the same kind of single-minded devotion, and I just love that.  I also love that Cat didn't fight the romance this time, she just went with it, bless her half-vampire heart.
0452289963|5.0|I wish I had this book years ago, my life would have been much smoother and less stressful.  A must read for everyone!  I read this book everyday to remind me how we all struggle for something we already have.
B000002LKU|5.0|I'm a long time Knopfler fan and just thought I'd take a chance on this one.  It is different, more blues and Mark only does lead vocals on one song.  But all vocals are excellent, a relaxing album.
B000I5Y8XM|5.0|Grabbed this one off the store shelf after hearing the first couple of cuts, and was not disappointed. None of the songs has the Irish-pub edge of some of her other stuff, but within the gentler demeanor of this CD there is tremendous variety. And it is very uplifting, especially because of the sense of personal struggle of some of the songs: struggles overcome, especially by faith, are the most uplifting things of all. Superb.
0061537934|5.0|I haven't cried over a book in a long time, but this one certainly touched my heart.  My husband walked into the room as I was reading the last few pages and I started reading aloud to him.  Knowing very little about what preceded those last few pages, he too was moved to tears.  What a touching story!  Dogs are such a beautiful gift from God.  Please read the book, you won't regret it.
0452286751|5.0|If you are a conservative, a libertarian, or at least a thinking person this is a must read.  Objectivism would be such a valuable paradigm for people to embrace, especially in the 'modern' world where 'second-handism' seems to tbe the coin of the realm.    Do yourself and the rest of us a favor, and get this book as well as Atlas Shrugged.  Read, Reflect, Repeat
0451526406|5.0|Most people know that Edgar Allen Poe wrote poetry. Of course, you'd be hard-pressed to make them quote a line that doesn't involve ravens.<br /><br />Well, it's time for some poetry homework -- \\"The Raven\\" is neither Poe's most beautiful nor his most striking poem. That is reserved for other, more obscure works in Poe's \\"Complete Poetry\\" -- and while one might expect the ghostly or macabre to be all throughout his work, it's also filled with transcendent beauty, wistfulness, and some truly amazing wordwork.<br /><br />Over his lifetime, Poe tried out many styles -- there are sonnets, short hymns, long rambling odes written in dramatic, vaguely Shakespearean style (\\"O, human love! thou spirit given/On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!\\"), acrostics, little exercises in self-reflection, a lyrical song or two, and some haunting stories rendered in verse like the bittersweet \\"Annabel Lee.\\"<br /><br />And the content of these poems is just as diverse. Some of them are distinctly dark --  sunken cities, tolling bells, haunted palaces, thoughts on the lingering spirits of the dead, abandoned valleys, and loved ones that have been stolen away by death (\\" I pray to God that she may lie/For ever with unopened eye/While the pale sheeted ghosts go by!\\"). And yes, it has the one about a midnight dreary, and a creepy raven with eyes like \\"a demon's that is dreaming.\\"<br /><br />And there are a lot of moments of beauty -- lush descriptions of nature, bittersweet dreams, love for a beautiful girl, and elfin odes to those who \\"put out the star-light/With the breath from their pale faces/About twelve by the moon-dial...\\" But in many of these, Poe manages to add a melancholy atmosphere -- just look at \\"Bridal Ballad,\\" whose narrator assures us that she is happy, but who is haunted by the \\"dead who is forsaken,\\" her former lover.<br /><br />Yeah, Poe's verse tends to be about as cheerful as his best known fiction, and often with some of the same preoccupations. He was a little less successful in verse at times, as occasionally you get some very strained verse schemes, like the terribly awkward \\"Eulalie\\" (\\"Now Doubt - now Pain/Come never again/For her soul gives me sigh for sigh\\").<br /><br />But like his stories, Poe's poems are spun out of exquisite, dreamlike words that can sometimes evolve into nightmares. This guy could evoke everything from ghosts to fairy-tales, brides to wormlike horrors. Even the more sentimental moments have a dark edge (\\"Oh, may her sleep/As it is lasting, so be deep!/Soft may the worms about her creep!\\"). And he also wraps his verse in some truly beautiful natural metaphors -- ancient forests, flowers, misty moons, and many other beautiful touches.<br /><br />And Poe's poetry even allows a window into his own mind at times, most painfully expressed as \\"from childhood's hour I have not been/As others were -- I have not seen/As others saw -- I could not bring/My passions from a common spring...\\" and the \\"mystery which binds me still.\\"<br /><br />For anyone who can appreciate his exquisite use of words, the \\"Complete Poetry of Edgar Allen Poe\\" is a must-read -- full of dark, meditative little gems and exquisite language.y you get some very strained verse schemes, like the terribly awkward \\"Eulalie\\" (\\"Now Doubt - now Pain/Come never again/For her soul gives me sigh for sigh\\").

B000K15VSA|4.0|This is a nice little gimic, and if you're nerdy enough (apparently I am) to like the 'toys' then it's kind of cool.  Overall though I'd simply choose the DVD's without the packaging.  Even with Mr. Scotts expression that this is HIS preferred final cut there are some redundancies in scenes that made me go 'huh?'.  As a fan of the various actors (i.e. Sanderson, recently appearing in Deadwood) it's cool to see the variations that have evolved.  One edition would probably be enough, but the choice of several iterations make it a viable repeat option.
B0013FXWU6|2.0|There Will Be Blood is probably one of the most over-rated movies of all time.  It's chopped up, uneven, incredibly over-wrought, and self-righteously over blown.  In all most every way it has none of the greatness of an epic such as Dances With Wolves or Giant, though it touts itself as being such.  The editor has taken a movie with a fabulous opening sequence and followed it with a chopped up series of sequences that are sparse meanderings that span a man's selfish lifetime.  Nothing leads to nothing.  Violence leads to nothing.  It's just stupid.  Daniel Day-Lewis' incredible performance aside, this movie sucks.  When it was finally over, I was only too glad.  Everyone that I know that has seen this movie has said the same thing, \\"what the hell was that?\\"  Disappointment abounds.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|I bought this movie because it was on the TV. I enjoyed it with Nanny McPhee teaching the kids some manners. Nanny McPhee stands for no foolhardiness and doesn't let the children away with any nonscense. She even tells the cook to make them soup which looks rotten and gives them measle medicine with lumps moving about in it. My favourite part was when she gave Mr Brown the fright of his life each night she kept coming to see him. The part at the begining when Mr Brown meet's Nanny McPhee, he thinks she's strange looking and almost jumps out of his skin but he invites her in reluctantly.<br />Mr Brown's Aunt is a nasty woman but at least she is paying the rent.<br />The woman who Mr Brown is forced to marry is a bit over the top and it's clear Mr Brown doesn't fancy her but she fancies him.<br />In the end Mr Brown marries the young Scullery Maid Evangeline who he seceratly fancies anyway. We see Nanny McPhee looking better here and looking like a normal person and looking younger.<br /><br />I give this film 5 stars.
B000053VAZ|5.0|I would recommend this film to anyone, not just Johnny Depp fans. It is wonderful and he is a true artist. Dealing with the mentally ill is never easy, on film or in real life but it is dealt with here. The difficulty of understanding how people feel and what they need. Mary Stuart Masterson was probably born for this part and this film no doubt, was supposed to make her a big star. Sadly for her, being in a film with Mr. Depp did not help her. He is so much more talented than anyone else, that he dominates the action and makes the rest of the characters look like, 'also featuring' extras. Julianne Moore has the worst lines ever and I did feel for her but Johnny Depp's 'Sam' is so much more interesting, that you hardly pay attention. There are also many actors in smaller roles, who will go on to greater things. Oliver Platt, William H. Macy, Danny Hedaya and Aidan Quinn, as Benny, barely manages, once again over-shadowed by our boy Johnny. Yes, I am an intense Johnny Depp fan but he has made a lot of terrible movies. This one is great. There are a few scenes that parents might not care for their young children to see but the PG rating is just fine. Buy it today!
B000F3T7X8|4.0|Swing and nightporter are shimmering 80's treasures. Like nothing else, swing is an uptempo rain of colours, nightporter a soft-vamp ballad, the only true pierrot-song i've ever heard. Outstanding and very original.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|One month ago I saw the 'Phantom of the Opera' on Stage in Brisbane Qld.Australia and it was fantastic.   Purchasing the 'Phantom' on DVD was the very best thing, if not better then the stage production. I can whole heartedly recommend this production. Inge Hartley

B0002TT0NW|5.0|Cauron brilliantly presents this third Harry Potter film. Great new casting for Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin and Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew. Old actors still show their brilliance like Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Great script. Great performance all round.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|26 years after its original release, this visionary film gets another revision by its director, 'bad boy' Ridley Scott. I say bad boy, but in fact, he is the good boy who stood up to his beliefs at the time when the studios used their contractual powers to impose foolish creative control.<br /><br />Personally, I didn't think the Final Cut was that different from the original Director's Cut; but yes indeed, it had a couple of new moments that, I guess, could justify the hype.<br /><br />Also, I am personally not a very big fan of such \\"complete collections\\"- yet another trick by the studios and their greedy sales teams, trying to 'extort' additional money from the customer. I was gladly going to buy just the Final Cut, separately- it's enough to me. Honestly who (except certain teenage kids with rich parents) has the time and the energy to see all available versions- including the unfortunate \\"narrated\\" version that Scott was forced to release first? Blade-Runner marathon? Overdose guaranteed!<br /><br />Anyway. All in all, this is the best copy of Blade-Runner ever released for purchase by the rest of us mortals. Since it is on a High Def Blu-Ray disk, you can see much more beautiful crisp detail. Blu-Ray disks will change our experience of and attitude towards viewing movies at home. Once you go Blu-Ray, you never go... well you know the drill.
B000W746GK|5.0|\\"Let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.\\"  \\"Don't worry. I will be.\\"             -- Lucius Malfoy & Harry Potter    Fantastic sequel. Great performances again by Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Alan Rickman. Kenneth Brannagh does well as the new DADA teacher: Prof. Lockhart. Jason Issacs is wonderfully cast as Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father. Another great screenplay by Steve Kloves and great direction by Columbus.
B000KZQKRC|5.0|This is one of the great albums. To have it on a new LP is great! Even the posters (3 of them) and stickers (2 of them) were included.  The poster included in my original Dark Side album was a bit different, but close enough. Not many would notice. The sound quality and quality of the 180g record is perfect. I'm not one to buy it and store it away, I'm gonna bring it out & listen to it. Now, not to scratch it.....
B000W74EQC|5.0|\\"You're a wizard, Harry.\\" -- Hagrid    I first saw this movie in cinemas when it came out. I had read all of the books released at the time and I thought it was a fantastic adaptation. There was great casting for Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Ian Hart as Quirrel, Maggie Smith as McGonagal, Alan Rickman as Snape, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Rupert Grint as Ron and Emma Watson as Hermione. The screenplay was beautifully written by Steve Kloves. J.K. Rowling must be proud. Colombus did fantastic work as a director too.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|As of right now this is the best collectors edition of Robocop available(yes better than the criterion disc). You get both the theatrical and directors cut in a stunning transfer each on it's own disc. I will not get into the movie because anyone interested has either seen this little gem or can read the other reviews on this page. Just know that this collectors edition is worth the price.

There is an unquestionable honesty that attatches to those of us who do,have or will face similar struggles. It is addiction in all it's facets played at maximum volume. There is,throughout the book a subtle melody of hope that is very discernable to anybody listening. A true exercise in \\"giving it away in order to keep it\\" Thanks Nikki.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|[[ASIN:B000KKPN5C Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras]]... The Nikon SB-400 flash handles 95 percent of what I want a flash for on a D40x. I have even had good results in large rooms. An off camera cord will come in very handy if you like to bounce and control your shadows.   It has a very low profile, even smaller than the old SB-23 which didn't have the bounce capability. Outdoor fill flash is excellent. I doubt you will be dissapointed with this flash unless you are trying to use it in multiple flash arrays, even then I can see some possibilites... If you need a small flash with bounce capability get this one. If you want full control get an off camera extension cord then you can put the light wherever you want.
B000002LGQ|3.0|1. Like A Prayer - Rocks the church floor with an \\"in-your-face\\" sexuality. The sexual lyrics are a mix of the erotic with a sweeping sense of gospel. Seems an odd mix of musical styles, but this works. It works in the sense of a great dance song, the verses are your invitation to stretch and become cognitive. Just before your mind becomes mundane with thoughts of \\"deep\\", you are on a trip down the waterfall to the overtly melodic chorus.<br /><br />2. Express Yourself - The album version of this song leaves so much to be desired to the \\"dance\\" ear. The guitar riffs are replaced with a bass line that induces the listener to move. This song is pure extacy on all levels. The lyrics leave you feeling independent, but happy and filled with freedom.

The instrumentation is minimal as are the vocals. Prince has written this track as an homage to himself.

Till Death Do Us Part - Sean Penn and Madonna, Sean Penn and the press, this auto-marriage tale of wedded hell is very pleasant to the listener. It has been said that hard times are good for the artist, true for Madonna here. This pop song begins with a staccato synth line that draws you in and smashes you around the dance floor. Glass smashing and Madonna's voice, how can this be wrong? It isn't.<br /><br />5. Promise To Try - One of the first in a long line of tracks about Madonna's mother. This ballad plays well in \\"Truth Or Dare\\" against the backdrop of a cemetery. A ballad just does not play well with the Madonna fan. We like to dance. We don't like to cry. \\"Little girl, don't you forget her name....\\"<br /><br />6. Cherish - \\"Boo-boo-be-doo\\".... Please oh please Madonna. Cherish is Madonna's attempt to re-invent the \\"True Blue\\" era. This doesn't work here for several reasons. The synth lines are more suited to the late seventies disco. Most of the seventies riffs worked, but not with this composition. The lyrical content is immature and reeks of adolescent love.<br /><br />7. Dear Jessie - An homage to youth. An almost danceable track that takes off where \\"Cherish\\" ended with the attempt to revert back to childhood. Not a very good track. Leaves you with a dull feeling.<br /><br />8. Oh Father - Madonna's not an author. This song is Madonna's attempt to write a novel, that didn't work, so she decided to put her words into a song. Perhaps a better idea. But, again, paternal abuse and dance just DO NOT BELONG together. What Madonna was attempting to do with this trashy ballad is beyond me. NEXT!<br /><br />9. Keep It Together - A bass line with a synth over-lay. Perfection in pop dance. I adore this song for it's simplistic, familial lyrics and equally simplistic composition.<br /><br />10. Spanish Eyes - Another ballad with a slightly sexual-religious tone. Madonna seems to be infatuated with a certain Latin man and attempts to write a song about it. Please....<br /><br />11. Act Of Contrition - Contains reverse samples of \\"Like A Prayer\\" within a record scratching, ear piercing, hodgepodge of crap whilst Madonna is reciting the Act Of Contrition from the Roman Rite....

B000YIGNKE|4.0|The reviews for this movie are quite mixed. I myself loved the movie. As much as I enjoyed the version with Amanda Root, I felt it was difficult to follow. This version was much easier to follow and the characters easier to relate to. I enjoyed it immensely. I would urge anyone considering watching it to do so, then judge for themselves. I would have given it 5 stars, except for the scene in the end where Anne is seen running back and forth through Bath to meet with Capt. Wentworth. I don't believe that is true to her character. She was far too reserved for such a display of emotion, and her position in life would never have allowed it. I have not read the book, however, and maybe completely off the mark in this, but I thought the scene a bit ridiculous. As a whole, I thought the movie sweet and romantic; a charming display of chivalry, gallantry, and honor. The speech patterns to be poetic and touching and the costumes and sets rich in beauty. This is a great movie, watch it with a friend and be prepared to be left speechless for a time while you lose yourself in a different, more dignified and elegant era.
0618918248|4.0|I remember picking up this book in the mall awhile ago and i found myself rereading it quite recently. This book is quite magnificent and does great justice to a man not only of great intellectual renown but also (in my opinion) moral integrity.     I am and atheist, so i must admit it was like preaching to the choir but it is nice to find a book that is great at articulating the real grievances non-believers have against not only religion but the expectaton of reverance of those who are \\"believers\\". This books speaks a about the both the extreme lack of proof for a theistic god (as opposed to a deistic god, which is really just an enlightenment last minute rescue of the God idea). The book attacks so many fundamental pillars inherent to all religions and it is especially enjoyable (although not by the other side) the sense of rage one can feel coming off the pages (how could atheists not be a little ticked off at what has been going on?)     I have only two complaints. The first is that this is a failed attempt. Dawkins as a scientists speaks the language of reason and logic. The failure of this approach however is that religion at the end of the day does not attempt to prove itself through logic. Faith is the argument made without or despite evidence to the contrary. It can survive the onslaught of reason. The second is that Dawkins seems to care little for discussing theological doctrine spending much more time focused on the conception of God himself. This to me reflects the ultimate flaw of many of the books on religion. Many religious people (i speak from personal experience) put far more faith into religion itself then the idea of god. Therefore ignoring the discussion of particular religious doctrine ignores a vastly important aspect of the debate. One cannot argue with Religion with addressing the Trinity (i'm not saying he doesnt at all) or the Jewish conception of Chosennes. This book is definitely recommended though.

B00005JPNZ|3.0|I kind of enjoyed the movie, but let's be honest, it's not the greatest episode of all the Indie films that have been filmed.  If you did not understand how Indiana Jones 'thinks' about his finds you would not understand the second half of the movie.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the special effects in the movie, but overall the movie was really flat.  The plot line was to simple(even for Indiana Jones).  Not to much of the 'Go Get It Indie' that we are used too seeing in the other films.
B00005JNQS|5.0|Robin Williams is a HIT in this movie!  Need I say more?  Seriously, though, I didn't have high expectations for it.  (I hadn't known he was in it before I watched it either.)  My 2 1/2 year old son loves robots lately, so I thought, \\"let's try out this new movie.\\"  I rented it and just had to buy it.  Great movie!  Clever, well-drawn, well-thought-out, great color, great action, funny!!!  A delight!  We try to keep our DVD collection small and rent a lot - but this was one we need to keep in our collection.

0756404746|2.0|Well, I'll start this out by stating that I accept the fact that my review will likely not sway that many would be readers out there, not with the huge amount of hype surrounding this book and a five-star review from Robin friggin'-Hobb on Amazon.com.  That being said, I just slogged through over 700 pages of thoroughly mediocre writing and feel that I'm at least owed the catharsis of an honest review.  Why only two stars, you ask?      First, to describe this as 'dark fantasy,' or even adult fantasy, is completely inaccurate.  None of the major characters die or even suffer in any meaningful way.  There is a large period where Kvothe lives on the streets in a port town, but the danger doesn't seem particularly real or threatening.  The worst thing that happens to him while in this 'dark' period, and I'm not exaggerating, is that some bully breaks his little wussy lute.  Oh, the humanity!  Kvothe spends more time mooning over some manipulative woman than he does fighting or casting spells (or shooting bows, or riding horses, or traveling, or any of a number of things we love reading about in fantasy novels).  I don't mean to say that this novel needs to be non-stop action, but there is a word for books where the protagonist spends most of his energy courting a woman: romance.      And this brings me to the second of my huge problems with this book.  Kvothe's love interest, a completely unlikeable woman named Dianne, or Deanne, or whatever (she goes by different names, see, because it's so terribly difficult to be pursued by so many men).  Actually, almost all the characters are unlikeable, with the exception of a few of Kvothe's classmates at the University and some of the more rustic characters at his inn.  Dianne strings Kvothe along throughout the entire book, and like some pathetic fool he just jogs along behind her, hoping for some sort of attention.  She leaves him without notice, dates other men incessantly, complains about what it obviously an easy life, and just generally behaves poorly.  It would be even more irritating if Kvothe himself weren't so insufferable.  The guy is good at EVERYTHING, and when I say everything, I mean it.  Medicine, magic, bartering, history, geography, business, thieving, horse-riding, acting, singing, playing the lute, fitting in with commoners as well as the nobility.  The book never says anything about sailing or swimming, but I'm sure that if there was a nautical scene he would have had a chance to teach some 60 year old ship's captain a thing or two.  I never once considered him even remotly believable.  I know that this is a fantasy novel, but you at least expect the characters to act realistically within the framework the author sets up.  I mean, this kid (and he is - at the time of the novel, he's between 15 and 16 years old) spends the first 12 years of his life in a 'troupe,' essentially a traveling circus or performer's group.  Then, he spends three years living on the streets as a half-starved beggar/thief.  Finally he manages to get to the University and b.s. his way in at a young age, and instantly he is great at everything.  I could go on and on about Kvothe, but I'm getting irritated just writing about him.  All I know is that when you're book is essentially a character study, it really helps when the character is likeable or at least interesting.      Another major complaint about this book is how conveniently the author muddies up technology to suit his needs.  You'll have one scene where people are using torches, riding horses, drawing water from wells, etc.  Then in the next, Kvothe the Stupendous will casually refer to a physiological concept not discovered in our own universe until the twentieth century.  A character will be looking at clouds and describing the shapes they see, and Kvothe the Omniscient will silently think that he knows the weather patterns that these particular clouds portend.  This is a trait you see in writers who are so immersed in our own culture of technology and conveniences that they literally cannot conceive there was a time when no one knew much of what we consider common knowledge today.      Fine, you say, but I read this author's work for the characters.  The problem is that the characters themselves often act irrationally or almost randomly.  With the exception of the metrosexual protagonist, there is no real consistency from one scene to the next with their behavior or even style of speaking.  In one particular scene a secondary character, who for the length of the novel has been depicted as a friendly, handsome, womanizing young man, launches into this bizarre threat against a relatively well-intentioned scribe.  His threat is very well written, almost poetic, but is completely inconsistent with his personality and totally out of proportion to the subject at hand.  Imagine if part-way through \\"The Two Towers,\\" Samwise threatened some harmless fool with dismemberment and death for asking why hobbits like to eat so much.  It would just be...weird.      All in all, this book is well below average.  The author clearly has a great vocabulary, but as far as I'm concerned he has a real problem with character development, creating an interesting or unique world, and coming up with a compelling plot.  I give this book a very, very qualified two stars.

B0012EM5D8|5.0|This is the best animated movie I've ever watched.  Barry (Jerry Seinfeld) is a newly graduated bee who has to decide what job he wants to work at in the hive.  The most adventurous job is a \\"pollen jock\\" who actually leaves the hive to get nectar from the flowers outside.  When Barry leaves the hive, he has several adventures, discovers humans are eating the honey that bees toil to make, and launches a lawsuit.  I loved this movie.  It's about teamwork, honesty, the importance of having a purpose in life (some very interesting things happen when the bees stop working), and even more importantly, the importance of bees in the pollination of flowers, fruits, vegetables and trees (even more important in light of the recent colony collapse disorder).    Usually, I find animated movies amusing but irritating in the obnoxious side characters and annoying actions (Madagascar is a good example).  Even Shrek gets on my nerves sometimes with the anger-management challenged ogre and super irritating donkey.  In contrast, Bee Movie was pure gold.  Barry (Jerry Seinfeld) was practical, charming and a great hero.  The other characters were great.  I found the bee jokes funny and actually pretty inventive.  The ending is unrealistic, but hey, this is a cartoon with a talking bee.  It's called willful suspension of disbelief.  I loved the ending, thought it was great and fantastic.  Hey, if a human can save the world, why can't a bee?  This is by far the best animated movie I've watched, and I think I've watched all the major animated movies.
0446693804|5.0|A WALK TO REMEMBER was a novel I checked out from the library because I was tired of fast-paced action novels by John Grisham and Tom Clancy (don't get me wrong; I love Grisham and Clancy).  I like dramas and romances, so I checked this one out.  It's the first Sparks novel I've read.    I was stunned.  Not only was it intelligent and engrossing, but it pierced your soul; it could make you laugh and cry.  The book tells the story of Landon Carter, a normal teenager who joins the crowds in stereotyping people, especially the preacher's daughter Jamie Sullivan.  She is kind and generous and in no way warrants their behind-back teasing, and she doesn't know about it.  But when dance dates are scarce, Landon finds himself asking Jamie.  Little does he know that this small choice will lead to a moving chain of events the leads him spiraling into a touching romance that will change his life.    The author writes from first person veiw and honestly depicts life in a small town in the 50s; the widely spread innocence and growing new ideas.  The book is engaging in its simplicity; it never tries to overdo any aspect.  The novel never tries to be more than the straight-forward love story than it is, and that makes it all the more touching and tear-inducing.  Sparks is a master at his trade, and I'm eager to read more of his books.      Highly recommended.

B0000VAFO0|3.0|Underworld is a sleek documentary on the plight of rats living inside a cave beneath Grand Central terminal in NYC, stated for demolition in 2006. Told with compassion and foresight, the filmmakers devote about 2 hours worth to the fringed little creatures, mostly told in flashbacks by a rat called \\"Sebastian\\" who smokes a pipe and spies on humans above in the city. I found it not only humanistic, because it advocates adopting stray rats, but also very entertaining and I had tears in my eyes near the end when I walked out of the theater and found myself surrounded by gerbils.

B0016HNOXQ|1.0|After waiting 10 years for a follow up to the greatest trip-hop music ever made, I was more than a little disappointed at what this is. This abrasive experiment lacks all of the elements I love from the first 2 albums. Namely: it's largely without a driving beat, it has none of the retro film noir aesthetics, and there's no song with a catchy hook.    Analysis aside, the worst thing I can say about Third is that I have to really TRY to like it. This happens all the time with good bands. They make great music then in later albums (and often their 2nd album) you try to force yourself to like it. And you know full well that if that were your introduction to the band, you wouldn't have liked them in the first place.    I don't have to try to like the other 2 albums. From 1st listen I was entirely hooked. With Third, if I really, really try then I can find some tracks that are not fully without merit.
B000A6CLL0|4.0|I purchased the entire 4 season set but will review Season 3 only here.   The things I really enjoyed about this set of 7 discs:    The features.   The special features on disc 7 and the individual, full length episode commentaries on some episodes are well worth the price of the set.    The Xindi.   I can't believe I am saying that since I wasn't very impressed by the Xindi arc and species when the episodes aired.  Now that I have the opportunity to see these creatures and their spacecraft over and over, in freeze frame and slow mo and to learn more about their development I am thoroughly enjoying them.  Caution though -- some of these species could be nightmare material (lol)when studied in depth like this.  But hey, it's great fun!   The thing I guess I didn't like has nothing to do with the product but rather with the show itself.   I did not like the direction many of the characters took (or rather the writing of them).  There seemed to be a lot of token violence, sexuality, and attempts to relate to current events.   I prefer my \\"Star Trek\\" to tell stories true to its own realm and not be infiltrated by the values (or lack thereof) of the real world.       I must say that these changes made for some interesting episodes, and having the opportunity to study these independently, hear commentary and get behind the scenes made even the crazy episodes worth watching again and again.

The agent should figure it out by himself. To make matters worse, he should steal the stuff in a way no one would ever suspect Israel has the materials.  Of course, the bad guys and the Americans are also around, to complicate the plot even more.  An extremely intelligent premise: a mission against all odds.  A digression: I rate this Follett's book second only to Pillars of The Earth or The Eye of the Needle, and side by side with The Man from St. Petersburg.   In addition to being (in my view) his best plots, each of these four books inaugurated a formula, later somehow repeated by Follett in other books. (For example, The Key to Rebecca or Lie Down with Lions follow the steps of The Eye of the Needle). In this sense, Triple, although a spy story like The Eye... it is also very original.

So I for one am glad she did the classes online.      It was through Oprah's show that I  got acquainted with THE SECRET and that has been a true life changer for me.  Get that one.

0679720200|5.0|Essentially this book is about a man whose alleged crime is merely the excuse used to remove him from society. During the trial of the central character we are told he is guilty of neglect, lacks empathy, and is in a sense socially maladjusted. For this he is executed. Today all we need to do to witness such an injustice is turn on the news to see so many of our fallen members of society judged on their social habits and personal shortcomings in the name of justice and the greater good.
037571412X|5.0|I think you have two choices when reading this book: be utterly horrified, or take it as a succinct bit of honesty about sex. Which you choose will depend, in all likelihood, on whether you're a woman or a man. Many women will see it as rank misogyny. I don't begrudge them that belief. I happen to think, on the contrary, that it is an absolute masterpiece. It does for the sexual revolution what Roth's American trilogy -- American Pastoral, I Married a Communist, and The Human Stain -- did for the rest of mid-to-late-twentieth-century American history: condense it down and focus its agonies on one man.<br /><br />Here the representative for 20th-century America is David Kapesh. Others will have met him in Roth's earlier novels, The Professor of Desire and The Breast; I've not read those, so I can't comment. In The Dying Animal, we meet Kapesh in his early seventies, a famous cultural critic who appears on public television every week, book in hand, white mane flowing and (one presumes) turtleneck up to his chin. He is an enthusiastic participant in the sexual revolution. It seems as though every semester he picks one new student to seduce after classes are over -- for sex, nothing more. This is just a meeting of flesh and flesh: everyone is aware of the game that everyone else is playing.<br /><br />This contract alone leads into the book's heart, which is a lecture on and a demonstration of what sex used to mean for someone of Kapesh's generation, what it means now, what changed, and how much we've forgotten about the revolution. In Kapesh's youth, \\"heavy petting\\" was a stage one got to after endless courtship; anything more would have horrified his parents, had they known. Without going into detail (this is a family publication, after all), we take substantially more contact for granted. As Kapesh notes, today's youth believe that absolute sexual freedom arrived along with the Declaration of Independence; we think it's a fundamental human right, as natural as the water we drink. Kapesh reminds us that in order to move from the era of heavy petting to this sexual anarchy, sexual anarchists had to set fire to a lot of taboos: like anything else that we take for granted, today's casual lifestyle was yesterday's struggle.<br /><br />During that struggle, Kapesh was an awestruck participant. He wasn't young enough to take the struggle in stride and accept it as part of his being; he was a mature man, already a married college professor, who saw the revolution for what it was and decided to dive right in. He lost a wife and child during the battle, but he knew what he was getting into and what he'd be giving up.<br /><br />When he gave it up, a lot of what passed for sexual certainty in the society was revealed to be hollow convention. Get married so that he could have unsatisfying but officially sanctioned sex with his wife, meanwhile yearning for the acres of supple flesh that attended his classes every semester; pretend that the omnivorous male inside could be locked away inside a socially respectable façade.<br /><br />His son never forgives him. To prove that he's so much more decent and moral than his father, he gets his girlfriend pregnant and promptly marries her. Tell her to get an abortion, Kapesh tells him. If she refuses, that's not your problem -- the sexual revolution made her a freestanding sexual being and it did the same to you. The son marries her anyway. When he goes on to have an affair a few children later, he has to endow that affair with social respectability: the girl is sweet and loving and intelligent and writes poetry and has wonderful parents. Kapesh can only stare with scorn: you're trying to camouflage a transaction involving meat. Why pretend that you are anything other than you are? Why lacquer sex with the social respectability that my generation so feverishly cast off?<br /><br />The son is devastated, but keeps returning to his father, whom he loathes. He needs to parade his respectability beforehis enemy, but at some level he probably also respects the choice that his father made. In this conflict between father and son, we have three generations of American sexual understanding: the father as a youth (sexual expectation: years of courtship followed by wedding followed by sex), father as grown man (the sexual revolution presents a world of limitless, dangerous possibility), and son as a grown man (trying to reassemble some sexual order after a generation of anarchy).<br /><br />Into Kapesh's life comes Consuela, a Cuban student born into the anarchy, but standing outside of it. She is beautiful and (it's important to the story) buxom, but she's kept aloof from the many men who presumably desired her. She can take or leave Kapesh, and this fact drives him crazy. For once he needs control -- needs to regain the order that he enthusiastically disposed of; to know that he can't control her, and that some other man can take her away, sends him into spasms of jealousy. In one rather graphic scene, he throws away all his self-control and lets the anarchy destroy him. Consuela is the agent of his destruction, but stands hautily by while it happens.<br /><br />All this in not much more than 100 large-print pages.

0767847431|3.0|This Sinbad has some great stop-motion animation however the best of it doesn't occur until the last fifteen minutes of the film so in that respect this is a very slow builder, but worth it for the end.<br /><br />Sinbad and his ship's crew find a special key. Koura an evil magician wants it back. Vizier turns up with the rest of the key and together they go on a quest to solve the riddle of what it opens.<br /><br />Of course the main reason to watch it is for the stop-motion. In the golden voyage you get centaurs, griffen, the godess kali, a ship's statue and harpies. The centaur and griffen battle is the big one but the godess kali fight sequence is also very impressive for its time. Watch this for the animation. The story doesn't really cut it though.
0634022296|4.0|I have several Beatles guitar books, most of which fall into two categories: 1) They are way beyond my level (I consider myself to be an intermediate level guitarist) or 2) They books don't use the right chords, so the songs sound just a little off. This book works well for strumming along with your favorite Beatle tunes. It contains every Beatle tune that I am familiar with plus many others. My only criticism is that the book is small and it is impossible to keep the book open to any particular page.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Soundtrack from the 2007 indie film of the same name.  Music won the Oscar for music written for a movie. Hansard and Irglova wrote the music and were the leads.  Music and story hang together well.  Real people in real situations with no Hollywood ending.  Hansard is the lead vocal for the Frames.  Irglova from Czech Republic is classically trained in music.  Their voices blend well and complement one another.  Hansard's guitar leads with piano highlights in most numbers.  The music stands on its own.  'Falling Slowly' is dynamite.  'Lies' is clever and angry.  'If You Want Me' is seductive.  Mostly smooth listening.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|In the '90s, I just liked a couple of Radiohead tunes (\\"Creep\\" and another from the Romeo+Juliet movie) but this New Year's eve, safely and snuggly at home, I watched a live studio recording of this album and felt transported to my youth yet transcendent because this music is so very modern....well, I could wax poetic about Radiohead now and bore you to tears, but I am also a fan because it was so genius of them to offer it up for free.  But I wanted my very own copy and was glad to get it.  They seem like nice boys, anyway.
B000GH3CVQ|4.0|Released before the movie Once popularized the music of the eclectic duo of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova.  Some are earlier versions of numbers heard in Once such as 'Lies' and 'Falling Slowly', but most are original to this album.  The title cut is an instrumental (piano) piece.  Both albums share a quiet combination of  mostly lead guitar and male vocal with vocal and piano highlights from Irglova, although they trade roles from time to time.  The music is soulful, relational, reflective at times, angry at times and revolves around real people and situations.  Worth a listen.

Then I bought the 2nd book, then I watched Eckhart (see how familiar you get with him?) on Oprah's webcasts...thank goodness for his insight and presentation.  You may have been chasing these \\"answers\\" for many, many years as I had been, or you may be new to this enlightenment stuff.  No matter; just get the book, you won't regret it.  Neither will your dentist.
0399226907|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone with a young child. My son loves to read it several times a day along with the soft caterpillar stuffed toy. It's great because it teaches children colors, numbers and simply explains the process of how a caterpillar becomes a butterfly.

Oh well, I'm grateful for the message (which I have been chasing since the '70s).  The awareness is finally getting around and no longer taboo conversation!  You will highlight the pages until there's no plain space left, but that's OK: just go ahead and get the book.
B00005JKZV|5.0|With the worldwide success of `The Fellowship of the Ring' the pressure was most definitely on Peter Jackson to try and match the first cinematic installment of the `Lord of the Rings' saga. I'm extremely happy to say that he accomplished his task with flying colors. The '02 release of `The Two Towers' met my every expectation and more. Like the books on which the films are based things only get better and better, every new situation more harrowing, every battle more immense and every word of dialogue more profound.<br /><br />`The Two Towers' excels in every category; cast, production values, soundtrack and special effects as it flows perfectly from the material presented in the first film, adding depth and texture to the characters and plot while expertly laying the necessary groundwork to prepare for the finale `The Return of the King'. Who said sequels are always a letdown? Not me!
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|This DVD brings the journey of \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\" to life with stunning visual details. For those who loved the book, watching the movie is a must because you will be transported in an experiential way to the spiritual awakening that James Redfield has revealed in his books. I would give this a 5-star rating if  this movie was accessible to everyone.     For those who haven't yet read the book: [[ASIN:0446671002 The Celestine Prophecy]], I recommend that you start there first. Otherwise points brought up in the movie won't make much sense. I also recommend that you try a contemporary novel in a similar visionary style to Redfield's writing: [[ASIN:0978107004 Nexus: A Neo Novel]]...a beautiful story of transformation by Deborah Morrison & Arvind Singh set at spiritual retreat.

B0001I561E|5.0|One of the Greatest Disney movies ever!  I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it as a kid and I bought it the minute that it came out on DVD.  Robin Williams and Gilbert Gottfried are funnier then ever. the songs are second to none and some of the greatest classics that have ever been performed. My personal favorite Disney movie i would confidently suggest this to anyone, you wont be disappointed! You can't call it a collection without this movie.
0805079831|5.0|Ideology aside, I consider this to be one of the most important books of our time. The reason I started off the way I did is that many people will react to Naomi Klein's book based on their political leanings. In fact, before starting this book, I was inclined to disagree with her premise -that Chicago School economics can be directly tied to oppressive regimes in many parts of the world. This book, however, thoroughly proves this disconcerting truth. The Shock Doctrine is also a brilliant expose and an elegant model which enables us to understand modern history in a new way.<br /><br /> I had originally seen a short video online that summarized the ideas of this book, and my first reaction (again, before reading the book) was that this must be a typical leftist rant, making an abstruse analogy between an economic system with which the author disagrees and real life practices like torture and shock treatment. As someone who was raised, or at least self-raised as basically a libertarian, I did not want to believe Klein's argument. In fact, the only reason I bothered to read the book is that I liked her earlier book, No Logo so much. She is one of the few writers on political and economic subjects whom I actually enjoy reading. Her style is so lucid that, even if I don't agree with some of her ideas, I understand where she is coming from and enjoy following her reasoning.<br /><br />Alas, there is nothing abstract, symbolic or abstruse about The Shock Doctrine. Nor is it any kind of conspiracy theory, as one reviewer oddly remarked. Everything in this book is well documented, and most of the references are anything but obscure. You can find almost everything that is written about here by going back over newspapers of the last few decades. The fact is, recent oppressive regimes in South America, Eastern Europe and Asia built their systems around the ideas of Milton Friedman and Chicago School economics. This is not a theory or an accusation, but a matter of public record. The only thing that we can dispute and speculate over is whether or not Milton Friedman (and his Chicago School disciples) really approved of the actions of tyrants like Pinochet. In the end, does this really matter?<br /><br />Again, when I first saw the video based on this book, I was skeptical, especially when I watched graphic footage of people being tortured and then told that there is a nearly perfect analogy between the literal shocking of political prisoners and the economic \\"shock therapy\\" inflicted on many nations. The reason this book overcame my skepticism is that these practices really were carried out in a symmetrical manner. That is, individuals were being tortured (by people who studied manuals on shock therapy, devised by a real life \\"mad doctor\\" named Ewen Cameron) at the same time their governments were conspiring with Chicago School luminaries.<br /><br />Advocates of free market economics have always said that we must separate economic and political freedom. For example, we can be horrified by the actions of a Pinochet and yet admire the \\"economic freedom\\" that exists under such a regime.<br />I think one of the most impressive achievements of The Shock Doctrine is the way it discredits this widely held assumption. Even assuming that Chicago School ideas represent the ultimate in economic freedom, is it right, even by libertarian standards, to force such freedom on people who don't want it? The idea of forcing people to be free is an oxymoron, and yet this seems to be the mentality of the U.S. government, World Bank and other supposed defenders of freedom when implementing their strategies in the Third World.<br /><br />Hardcore libertarians will argue that nothing in this book is a refutation of free market capitalism because none of the examples given are true examples of pure laissez faire capitalism. As someone who would have said this myself twenty years ago, I would now simply ask, what difference does it make? Similar arguments are made by dogmatic Marxists concerning the atrocities of Mao and Stalin (they weren't \\"really\\" communists). If we are shown, time after time, that a given ideology is used as a justification for implementing policies that include torture, the murder of dissidents and wide-scale corruption, it may be time to rethink that ideology.<br /><br />Naomi Klein is an advocate of a \\"Third Way\\" between capitalism and communism. Examples of this include the relatively free but socialistic Scandinavian nations. Personally, I don't find these rather bureaucratic societies very attractive, being something of a hardcore anarcho-capitalist in my heart. Yet if people genuinely want a society that looks like modern day Sweden or Venezuela, do I (or the U.S. government) have the right to say they  can't have it?<br /><br />The Shock Doctrine illustrates something that goes beyond politics and ideology. I don't really believe that the people in government, industry and the World Bank, who are responsible for many of the atrocities Klein documents, are actually believers in Chicago School economics, laissez faire or any other system. What they want is wealth and power, and they use ideology as a justification for their actions.<br /><br />If we put aside the political theory and look at the actions and strategies this book catalogs, we see a clear pattern. These people, as Klein documents, use war, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and the like as opportunities to exploit the masses. This is not a mere hypothesis, for there are ample quotes in the book where this doctrine is openly admitted by those who carry it out. Klein stops short of conspiracy theory,  the kind that claims that catastrophic events (such as 9/11 and even natural disasters) were orchestrated by those who later exploited them. Whether Klein's more moderate position or the conspiratorial one is closer to the truth is ultimately of secondary importance. The fact is, those at the top of the power structure use disasters as opportunities to increase their wealth and power.<br /><br />The beauty of this book is that it presents a coherent picture of American (and allied nations) foreign policy and, to some extent, domestic policy -- the Patriot Act and the Katrina tragedy are also described -- that clearly explains the modus operandi of the power elite. It doesn't matter what kind of political system you think is ideal. This is what is really happening. The book concludes on an upbeat note, as hard to believe as that might seem. There is evidence that as people wise up to the shock doctrine strategy, it will become less effective. Hopefully, many people will read this book and the process will be accelerated.rocities of Mao and Stalin (they weren't \\"really\\" communists).

B00104QSOM|5.0|Similar to the film [[ASIN:B00005V9IJ Cast Away]] in which Tom Hanks carries the entire production, THERE WILL BE BLOOD has that same air due to the phenomenal performance by Daniel Day-Lewis ...with one big exception. Hanks was alone, so there really was no other supporting cast to compare him against while on his little island (unless you count the volleyball, `Wilson'). Daniel Day-Lewis was surrounded by a fine cast, but he outshone everyone of them by leagues.<br /><br />Not surprising, Day-Lewis won every acting award in every awards ceremony in 2007 (from the Oscars on down).<br /><br />More of a story about greed, There Will Be Blood is also a battle of wills: one with god-fearing faith and the other without. The faithful is represented by a fire-breathing preacher named Eli Sunday (Paul Dano, [[ASIN:B000K7VHQE Little Miss Sunshine]]). Apparently an identical twin, Eli's brother Paul finds the successful oil tycoon Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and offers up his family's ranch in California as a place where \\"oil runs on the surface of the ground.\\" Daniel and his `son' head onto the ranch and discover that there is, indeed, a lot of oil to be had. Making an initial promise to Eli that they'll \\"build a new church\\" for the local congregation, Daniel sets to work buying up all the surrounding property and dropping his first rig into the ground. Problems quickly arise with Eli, however, who has his own form of greed: the greed of religion. Wanting his money to build his church, Eli inserts himself into Daniel's business and the two quickly bump heads. Bad things begin happening around the new oil derrick: a well-man dies, an explosion and fire, and the sudden head injury of Daniel's son, H.W. Plainview (Dillon Freasier).<br /><br />The greed of Daniel Plainview knows no bounds, and the internal corruption that it causes is eked out in terrible portions. When Daniel put his son on a train and abandons him, we see that there's much more beneath the surface of this fractured man. Morality isn't something he's familiar with. Eli quickly zeroes in on this and all but forces Daniel to be baptized and saved in order to continue his successful drilling of the area. This is something that will come back and haunt both Eli and Daniel at the end of the film.<br /><br />Again, it is the awe-invoking performance by Day-Lewis that carries the film throughout its 158 minute length. The other actors do fine jobs, no doubt about it, but they pale in comparison to Day-Lewis' John Huston inspired performance (his voice was impeccable).<br /><br />This is a pretty dark film with not-just-a-few allusions that lean toward biblical text (many of the character names are taken straight from the bible, including Abel, Mary, Daniel, and Eli). The allusions go deeper than simple names, however, and watching There Will Be Blood one can't help but see them. The great part about this is that the ending doesn't wind up where you think it should. Forget redemption. You'll know how harsh Daniel Plainview's life has become when you hear him say, \\"I'm finished.\\" [shiver!]rality isn't something he's familiar with.

B0018DUPTE|5.0|Geoff Emerick was the recording engineer behind such seminal works as Revolver and Sgt. Pepper. He was also privy to most of the innerworkings of the Beatles' recording sessions even if he wasn't the chief engineer on all their albums. Through careful observations of the Beatles' compositional styles and perceptive insights into the dynamics of their  personalities, Emerick brings a welcome clarity to the subject of how the Beatles worked in the studio and how their vision of rock evolved. The early days are evoked with particular charm, especially the memories of recording \\"She Loves You\\" at the same time that frantic fans were invading EMI studios. Emerick's comments on the raw energy of \\"She Loves You\\" versus the more contained power of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\\" are more than worth the price for any serious Beatles historian. Interesting, detailed, and very readable. A gem in the ongoing treatises upon Beatle-ology.<br /><br />Donald Gallinger is author of the novel, [[ASIN:1601641591 The Master Planets]]
B0013FNC38|5.0|This is the first CD of Mr. Mraz's that I have owned, & I am truly obsessed with it!  My love for his music began a month or so ago, when I was given the link to his \\"I'm Yours\\" video.  That song is such a fun, upbeat song, I was hooked immediately (& I can't imagine anyone NOT liking it)!  As far as the over-all CD is concerned, the more I listen to it, the more I am impressed with Jason's talent as a songwriter/singer/musician!  His talent & virsatility are truly incredible!  I agree with another reviewer who said that he is right up there with Elton John & Billy Joel as far as his talent is concerned, & hopefully, one day will be recognized as such! FYI -- I am a 52 yr. old female, so I think that his music appeals to a variety of people & ages.  Both of my daughters who are in their 20's also love Jason's music!  BUY this CD - it will be the best one you've bought/heard in a long time -- you will truly enjoy it - guaranteed!  Thank you so much Jason Mraz for sharing with us your amazing talent & fabulous music!
0767836286|1.0|I can't tell you why without revealing a crucial plot twist; however, I can say that everything leading up to the climax suddenly depends on things just happening to work out right. The success of a very intricate plan suddenly becomes dependent on numerous chances that the writer & director must have thought made the plot event more clever. Wrong.
0743277465|2.0|The Art of Learning as an autobiographical story makes for good reading.  However, the book introduces itself, and seems to be marketed, as a practical guide for people interested in improving their own learning skills.  I question how well the majority of people will be able to make much use of the book in that way.      Waitzkin's presentation and description of learning techniques is pretty vague.  While I have little doubt that Josh Waitzkin is an accomplished learner, I don't think that he successfully, practically transmits what he knows about learning to the reader.  It seems that he has an unusual capacity to learn, and while I don't think that that capacity is necessarily \\"genetic\\" or somehow hopelessly unavailable to those not blessed with it from birth or a very early age, I don't think that most people will improve their learning skills very much through Waitzkin's description of techniques that he may understand and be able to apply very easily, but which refer to and rely on processes and perceptions internal to him that can't, or at least aren't in this book, adequately conveyed through the written word.  Though I think I may understand what \\"smaller circles\\" (one of the learning strategies Waitzkin outlines) means on some level, how to actually apply it to something I'm trying to learn is not clear to me (and the ideas behind it seem fairly cliche, like take one step at a time, you have to walk before you can run, etc.).    Though it could be argued that it's scope is more limited, for a book that provides more concrete methods for improving learning and performance, I'd recommend \\"The Inner Game of Tennis\\".  I think in that book more people are going to find techniques that they can try out and from which they can make some real progress in learning tennis and in understanding how we learn.  It can also be applied to endeavors other than tennis.    Read \\"The Art of Learning\\" for its interesting stories and to get a peek into the life and developmentof an uberachiever, but for a practical guide on improving your learning ability and acquiring new learning skills, look elsewhere.

0440241030|3.0|PLOT: The former Military Police, loner and larger than life guy, Jack Reacher, is back. This time he sits in a café in New York City where he becomes a witness without knowing. A day later he is hired to solve the kidnapping of the wife and stepdaughter of Edward Lane, ex-army officer and now the boss of a gang of private mercenaries. Even if Lane has the money to pay and the firepower to kill any kidnapper he has not the right guys to do the detective part of the job. Unfortunately the more Reacher finds out the more he feels that something about whole the case is completely wrong. And he starts to dislike Lane and his posse of Special Forces veterans. So he wonders why he wants to solve the case - for Lane, for the victims or for his own sake? What starts as a kidnapping in New York ends up in a deadly gunfight in the British countryside more than 3,000 miles away.    How could anybody not like Jack Reacher? Tall, strong, big, clever, invincible and independent. (This time Lee Child even put Reacher's CV on the first page!) Just the kind of guy you need when you got a problem. As always it is fun to see Reacher unravel tiny bits of evidence and draw conclusions out of minor details and seemingly unimportant or unrelated events. Therefore he comes to conclusions quicker than any other man alive.  Since as in real life most riddles and crimes take time to solve, the pace is (positively) agonizing slow. From the pace and Reacher's solid but slow process the book reminds me of \\"The Enemy\\" except there are a lot less dead ends during his investigation. In general the reader knows only as much as Reacher does - or less since he prefers to demonstrate his knowledge instead of simply telling it to anybody.  Unfortunately the conclusion behind the kidnapping is guessable long before the end. Also the quick and easy gunfight showdown is a bit disappointing since one could expect tougher resistance from highly trained man.    Even if this is not a page turner that will keep you glued to your seat it still is an enjoyable book, quite well written and a fast read. In comparison to Lee Child's last book \\"One Shot\\" the initial plot may not be as fascinating at first glance but on the other side the turn of events and the solution are a lot better, there are no unbelievable freakish bad guy characters and there are less flaws. Overall a clear vote for \\"The Hard Way\\".  For those not acquainted with the Jack Reacher character I would recommend to read \\"The Enemy\\" first and then read the rest of the books as they were published. But this is only to get to know the character better - it is not needed to understand or to enjoy this book.    Again this new book is not on the same level as Lee Child's best work (\\"Die Trying\\", \\"The Visitor\\"/\\"Running Blind\\", \\"Without Fail\\" or even \\"The Enemy\\"). But hey - if you already know and like Reacher then you cannot afford not to read this one anyway. And as usual I sure can hardly wait for the next Jack Reacher book to be released in paperback...
B000UR9TQO|2.0|Let me start off by saying the 2 Stars I've given to this are not for the movie content, but rather the very poor packaging for what is supposed to be deluxe LTD Edition. Similar packages by the Dylan, The Doors, U2 and others all have top quality content in both music & packaging with hard case boxes, this set on the other hand is made of the most flimsy box they could find & is basically not what you'd expect from Zep who supposedly pride themselves on quality. So the Verdict is save money & buy the standard edition which I award 4 stars, the Ltd Edition packaging on the other hand gets 1 star.
B000U7169M|2.0|Swank is such a talented actress, and her costar Idris Elba is equally talented.  But their talent is wasted in this film.  The script is pretty standard stuff, though the ending did have a decent twist.  (however, if you pay attention you will catch on well before the climax).  The scenery is beautiful, marred only by the plagues infesting this small town.    AnnaSophia Robb, who play little Loren McConnell, is a lovely child, with very captivating eyes, but again she is wasted here.    The movie isn't bad, but it falls prey to cliche's of this genre'.  And that is another problem...it doesn't really fit into a specific mold.  It isn't horror, not really suspense, not quite mystery....so it had the potential to be great, but it was one cliche after another.    Too bad, because this isn't a type of movie we see often, and it was full of talented actors, but if you have a slow, rainy two hours you could certainly do worse.
0380730405|1.0|This book puts women in the worst of light. The young woman is  plan out shown as dumb and even backwards. Normally I like Gothic novels. If this had been the first one I had read I would have never read another. She is unable or unwilling to see anything on the bright side. Sorry I really have nothing good to say about the book.
0061537934|3.0|I enjoyed the book very much. The reason that I don't give it another star is the epilogue chapter. I can imagine about a half-dozen different endings that would have been better. Fortunately a book is about the journey much more than the destination.    I think that since the narrator is a dog rather than a human he has all the inside information that a family member would have, but is detached enough to see the humor (dark though it may sometimes be) in the tragic circumstances.    I enjoyed the racing aspects of the story, and I revelled in the narrator's joy at having a \\"hot lap\\" with his master. While the circumstances in the book may have been rather depressing, the racing and the narrator's overall outlook serve as an antidote that more than compensates.    As a man I hate to admit that I cried fairly often during the reading of this book. It was never at the \\"sad\\" parts it was always during the \\"happy\\" or emotionally charged parts. I don't think I would have cried a few years ago, but since the birth of my daughters I've become quite the crybaby.    I recommend it to anyone who wants to get a man to read a book. He may or may not like it, but at least you gave it a good try.
0756404746|3.0|The Name of the Wind is a good novel, but I found throughout the work that things began to really repeat themselves.  Kvothe is always broke for instance.  It doesn't matter what fortune he stumbles into, either.  You can expect within ten pages to find that fate has conspired against him to rob him of funds to pay for his tuition.  Perhaps this and the many other repeating coincidences have a place in the novel, but I can't help but wonder if the author found himself struggling to keep the story going without relying on them.    Overall, it is a good read, and I would recommend it; however, I hope the next tale can overcome the little annoying loops that seemed to nest themselves in this one.
0553381687|5.0|A Game of Thrones is set in the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, a land reminiscent of Medieval Europe. Here the seasons last for years, sometimes decades, at a time.  In this book each chapter is telling a different persons story, but yet they are all intertwined.  Eash person is just as fascinating as the next.  I think this book is the great start to a great series.  I wonder why Hollywood has not \\"cashed\\" in on these books and turned them into movies.  They would be a lot more entertaining than Harry Potter.  Even though this book is a pretty good size, never for a minute does the reader lose interest.  This book will keep you glued right up until the very last page.
B00004SU5J|4.0|I especially like the first number, Rose Rouge, but the rest of the CD is enjoyable as well.  Also available in an edition with a 2nd CD containing additional mixes.
0312360266|1.0|This book is trashy, poorly written and boring. I would not reccommend it for anyone under the age of 18. I absolutely hate to NOT finish reading a book, I usually tough it out. But, a little less than half way through, I decided this was no longer worth my time. The characters were transparent, the themes made me feel uncomfortable. I cannot beleive this is a \\"teen\\" novel. Utterly pathetic.
B000K15VSA|5.0|I love this movie and I love this collector's edition.<br /><br />First, I really liked the Final Cut. Warning: I'm giving something away here if you haven't seen it yet, so continue to the next paragraph if you don't want to know. Anyway, in particular, seeing Zhora running from Deckard without the obvious stunt woman wig was a great fix. That scene used to completely rip me out of my suspension of disbelief as my eyes rolled to the back of my head.<br /><br />I know some people like the voice-over, and I know it's quite controversial. I would just say that voice-overs, used carefully, can work. Personally, I like the additional information provided by the narrative. However, in the original version, I think it was over-used. The movie Dune, for example, seemed to be told completely inside people's heads, which ruined the film for me.<br /><br />Next, the behind-the-scenes documentary was fabulous. I had no idea what a challenge it was to put together one of my favorite films. For fans of the movie, this edition provides a ton of interesting information and stories. I was blown away. I'm amazed the movie ever made it to theaters.<br /><br />I highly recommend this edition for fans of this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will many times again.
B000085RTZ|5.0|I've listened to all of Kamelot's albums now.  I started a few months ago on Napster and systematically made my way through most of them.  I was very impressed with the production on each album, the tight composition of each song, and the overall melodies.  The singing is great too.  While I was impressed with them, I somehow left this one for second to last... and wow when I listened to it, I couldn't believe how much better it was than the others.  I was already hooked and I thought they were a 5-star band.  But when I heard the intro to Epica, I got hooked.  I immediately bought the MP3 album here off Amazon, which I believe to be a great price, and listened to the whole album on my iPod.  What an amazing treat!  From the opening intro, which is very powerful, to the roller coaster of the rest of the album, to the final amazing songs and the final outro, I was hooked.  I find albums with great intros and outros are often composed well, and this album is just such an album.  If you like complex music with nice melodies, great guitar work without excessive shredding, awesome drumming, and just great composition in general, look no further than Epica.  It's a real epic - very appropriately named!
0743270754|5.0|I have read many books about Lincoln and this by far the very best. Although Goodwin is a liberal this book is neutral.

B0018QPPXW|5.0|Risky Business is a fantastic movie, much more complex than the standard teen fare at the time.  Great music by Tangerine Dream (written especially for the movie) and strong performances from its young cast, most notably a nineteen year old Tom Cruise and twenty four year old Rebecca De Mornay.  (Small side note:  Cruise and De Mornay lived together for over two years after making the movie, so the chemistry on-screen must have been pretty real!)<br /><br />The original end of the movie was much darker than the happy, everything turns out okay version that was released.  Both versions were filmed and shown to a test audience, which preferred the happier, lighter version.  The original has (to my knowledge) never been released in any form, and I was concerned that it had been lost.<br /><br />I'm very happy to report that this 25th anniversary release is planned to include a new making-of documentary along with the alternate ending and commentary by Tom Cruise, director Paul Brickman, and producer Jon Avnet.<br /><br />So, it appears that this is what Risky Business fans have been waiting since 1983 to see!  The DVD is scheduled for release on September 16th, so we'll have to wait just a little longer.  Keep in mind also that while the press information is normally correct, all of it is subject to change prior to release.  But, it certainly looks very promising.<br /><br />Sean P. Logue, 2008
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|This is an excellent new album by Donna Summer.  My favorite track is \\"Stamp Your Feet\\".  This is a very positive song about not giving up.  My other favorite track is \\"Sand On My Feet\\".  This is a pretty romantic song.  I like the acoustic guitar playing by Angelo Petrucci on this track.  \\"The Queen is Back\\" is a funky sexy track that gets me moving.  I love this song.  The title track is an upbeat track with a reggae sound.  Donna sounds great with Ziggy Marley here.  Donna slows it down a bit with \\"Be Myself Again\\".  The keyboard playing by Sebastian Arocha Morton is lovely on this track.  \\"Mr Music\\" and \\"I'm A Fire\\" are good dance tracks.  There is a vitality in Donna's voice that comes through on these two songs.  \\"Fame The Game\\" is a song about the price of fame and the illusion of happiness.  Tom Hemby gives this track an edge playing the electric guitar on this song.  I love the lyrics and musical arrangements of these songs very much.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|I have the video version of \\"Firelight\\" and have watched it many times over the years since its release. I never tire of its gorgeous scenery, skillful, heartfelt acting, and the haunting, tragic, passionate and sexy storyline. The couple, Stephen Dillane and Sophie Marceau, are completely believable as the Victorian era lovers.<br /><br />I wish that there were more films made like this one. This genre has a built-in audience, just waiting for one more \\"perfect love\\" tale.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Not just a chick flick.

Overall..the product could have been packaged much better, a couple of extras could have been nice..like backstage access, interviews, etc. I guess the boys are getting a little too old for that!
B000002KDO|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! Black Sabbath's third studio album peaked at #8 & is one of their very best. It was the second one they released in 1971 & I consider it to be better than Paranoid.    There are eight songs on the album, of the eight only the very short instrumental \\"Embryo\\" misses the mark, but at 28 seconds in length it's not long enough to bother me. \\"Children of the Grave\\" & \\"Into the Void\\" are the two outstanding tracks here. They're among the best ever recorded by Black Sabbath. The latter one is a science fiction work & was becoming popular as material for songs at that time. \\"Sweet Leaf\\" was the song that got the most airplay from Master of Reality, along with \\"Lord of This World\\" & \\"Solitude\\" are very good songs. The latter one is a ballad; Ward on occasions would do the vocals for these type of songs. \\"Orchid\\", another instrumental, & \\"After Forever\\" are average songs that pale somewhat against the rest of the album.     Riff-master Tony Iommi shines again as lead guitarist, I'm still surprised that he doesn't receive more accolades than he does. Of course Ozzy was the frontman & one of the best in rock; whenever a band has someone out front as dynamic as Ozzy, it makes it harder for the rest of the band members to receive their credit. The classic line up of Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler & Bill Ward, is one of the most talented from the seventies. It's good to see that they finally made the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|We love \\"A New Day\\" on Blu-ray!  Watching it in our home theater with a 108\\" screen makes it feel like we are live in the front row.  The second disc is well done, too.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|As an Adams buff, I was highly skeptical this movie would be acceptable to my fellow Adams historians.  We would not now have a country without John Adams.  In spite of his mistakes (the Aliens and Seditions Act being the worst), he was an honest, ethical person whose contributions have been overshadowed by better politicians like Jefferson and Franklin. He was generations ahead of his time in his social perspectives (his staunch abolitionism and respect for women being two of them). There is no John Adams monument in Washington, DC and no picture of Adams on our everyday currency (despite non-Presidents images appearing) but at least we have McCullough's wondrous book and now this beautiful film.  Abigail Adams, no less a person than John Adams, was her husband's best friend and chief adviser.  They were equals at a time when there was little power for, as Abigail said, \\"women and slaves\\".    The film completely recreates the time.  Anyone who has been to Adams' birthplace and Peacefield can attest to how accurate the depictions are of those places.  Giamatti's intelligent, intuitive performance has made  the role his.  Linney, Dillane, Morse and Wilkinson are also excellent.  The direction is adult, unflinching and honest.  And yes, it is shot a bit dark but the content more than makes up for the camera.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  The sacrifices of this good and decent human being will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.

An absolute must for your Dio Collection,one of the best.  Hope review is of help.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I am what you call a Madonna fanatic. I've loved the woman since I was 14 years old. I've basked in her glory for over half my life, always inspired by her openness about her sexuality, her forthrightness when discussing pressing social issues (like gay rights-- thank you, girl!) and her sheer drive and determination. She's got in goin' ON--even at 49. (And for those who can't seem to stop pointing out her age, SHAME ON YOU! Thank God for someone like Madonna who tells you where you can stick your stupid ageist beliefs and who plays by her own rules.) Her vastly underrated 2003 record AMERICAN LIFE was a commercial \\"flop\\" (fans weren't ready for a folksinging Madonna), while 2005's follow-up, the critically lauded CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR, didn't fare much better in terms of sales (though the accompanying tour was, of course, the most successful tour of the year, thank you very much). It seems Madonna has been struggling to find the balance between artistic freedom and relevance for the past few years, and--like Mariah Carey before her--was \\"in need\\" of a big hit to put her back on top. That hit could very well come from HARD CANDY, her 10th studio recording. But this time out, Madonna ditched the innovative underground spinmeisters (like William Orbit and Mirwais) who helped define her sound on the last several records and sought out the hitmakers of today: Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, Nate \\"Danja\\" Hills (of the Neptunes) and Pharrell Williams. For some, this will come off as an act of desperation. But is it? Madonna has always been one to latch onto trends. The only difference is that in the past, she set her sights on stuff that was taking place in the fringes of society, whether it was in the thrift shops she frequented while making her way up the ladder in New York, bringing \\"voguing\\" to the masses, or popularizing \\"crumping\\" on the Confessions Tour. Here she embraces a fully formed trend, jumping merrily on the bandwagon. In some ways, this is shocking: Madonna has, in fact, been widely known for having full control over her image, from her look to her sound. And here she is, gleefully surrendering to the talents of a bunch of guys who have the power to make anyone over (see: Nelly Furtado, Duran Duran, et al ad nauseam). The results are a mixed lot, though not so much in terms of the music itself. As far as that goes, this is a stellar record, chock-full of the kind of potential No. 1 singles that Madonna hasn't churned out in years. From the driving marching-band pulse of first single \\"4 Minutes\\" (already shooting up the charts with a bullet) to the peppy \\"Give It to Me\\" right down to Timberlake's \\"What Goes Around\\" knock-off, \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You,\\" HARD CANDY is one of Madonna's most pleasurable albums ever. The problem is that it's not really a Madonna record, per se. On one hand, one can only imagine that Her Highness experienced a bit of a personal breakthrough by letting someone else sit in her driver's seat. Kudos to her. But on the other hand, HARD CANDY is a better showcase for the talents of her various producers than it is for Madonna's creative vision. Where is the woman who spearheaded transformative singles like \\"Like a Prayer\\" and \\"Papa Don't Preach\\"? Here she happily gives it up to a bunch of merry pranksters who reinvent her as a hip-hop queen. Much of it works, of course. In fact, most of it does. Madonna is certainly versatile enough that she can tackle any endeavor and usually come out on top (we'll forget about some of her movies and that embarrassing EROTICA album). Here she gamely makes her way through a series of tracks that would sound right at home on Furtado's next record. Other highlights include the lovely \\"Miles Away\\" (which finds her lamenting \\"You always have the biggest heart/When we're 6,000 miles apart\\"), the effervescent \\"She's Not Me\\" (on which she defends herself against another vamp who's encroaching on her territory) and \\"Dance 2Night\\" (a jubilant number recalling Timberlake's Duran Duran collaboration \\"Nite Runner\\" that has Madge once again espousing the pleasures of getting down on the dance floor. Go figure.) \\"Heartbeat\\" is a club thumper of the highest order (and one of, um, three tracks on the record that shares the same message as \\"Dance 2Night\\"), and \\"Beat Goes On\\" (which features a rap cameo by Kanye West) is pure musical sugar, going down as smoothly as anything she's recorded in this vein (\\"Lucky Star,\\" \\"Material Girl\\") before. (It's certainly a step up from the near-awful leaked version of the song that turned up on the 'Net last year. Thank God.) The title track is willfully vapid, but it's not terrible. I wish I could say the same about \\"Spanish Lesson,\\" one of Madge's most self-conscious and literal album tracks ever. Here, she gives her listeners exactly what the title suggests, filling us in on how to say any number of sayings in her second favorite language.

There's very little--apart from \\"Give It to Me\\"--that signifies that this is a Madonna record. Honestly, these songs could have been recorded by any number of today's hottest talents, which means that often Madonna sounds like a guest star on her own record.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is unique as an extension of a pretty tired franchise.  Rather than a slick, corny, or ridiculous pastiche, Craig really tries to do something new and pulls it off.<br /><br />Bond is just promoted, and he is quite a raw talent, if fanatically devoted to his task.  He is far less assured and cool than Connery, engaging in really gritty fights in which he occasionally gets hurt.  There is also more on his background:  an orphan, gone to Oxbridge and wanting to fit into the elegance and style, which explains both his intensity to conform, his uniquely relentless aggression, and his pursuit of cool.  He is also more vulnerable than Connery, esp. to the love of the unbelievably lovely Eva Green.  The villains are also subtle, if sociopathically cold, and their game is not completely explained, which leaves the viewer hoping that the concept of Spectre will evolve in subsequent films from its simple bad guy/terrorist/extortion caricature.<br /><br />Best of all, Craig is so good that you can believe him, just as you could with Connery.  Warmly recommended.
B0000C1733|4.0|This is a great collection of songs , but it's missing five hits from there album One hot minute , including Aeroplane and many other's , i guess the reason there not on here is because none of the band members were fond of Dave Navarro , which means that is why they didn't include the five hits on here , i guess they don't care if we like them.

B00139W3NE|4.0|***1/2 2007. Based on Philip Pullman's [[ASIN:0590541781 Northern Lights]] and written and directed by Chris Weitz. Academy award in the Best Visual Effect category and a nomination (Art Direction). One of the big flops of theses last months. Too bad because the film looks great and the script is for once bright and  smart. I didn't read the book so don't expect to find here pointless comparisons. You don't compare a piece of music with a painting, do you ? Like Victor Fleming's [[ASIN:B000ADS63K The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], THE GOLDEN COMPASS plays on two levels, the fantasy genre in order to attract the juvenile eyes and the symbolic level which is abundant enough to please the demanding spectator. Recommended.

B00005O438|3.0|Most people know the basic plot of Stephen King's CUJO.  The title character, a gentle but huge St. Bernard is bitten by a rabid bat, contracts rabies and becomes a frothing maniacal monster that terrorizes some people most famously a mother and her young son stuck in a stalled yellow Pinto at a remote farm house.  The mother, Donna, played by Dee Wallace is not particularly sympathetic.  She's got a nice good looking husband who is apparently a good provider, a lovely waterfront house, a cute son and apparently nothing to do but run errands and have an affair with a not particularly attractive handyman.  Maybe her gripe with her husband is he runs around in a cute red convertible while she's stuck with this lemon of a Pinto?  Anyway the first half of the movie sets up Donna and her husband's family life and more briefly we get a look at Cujo's family - a mean car mechanic, his downtrodden wife and their son who seems like a nice enough kid.  Oh and we get to see poor Cujo bitten on the nose by the bat while he is chasing a rabbit.    Events conspire so that Donna is caught by her husband with her boyfriend just as she is breaking the affair off.  Her husband is called away on business to Boston and goes off in a bit of a huff things being as they are.  The wife and cute son are left with the always breaking down Pinto and she with the little boy in tow drive it out to the remote farm where  Cujo's owner, the mechanic, lives and the terror begins.    I read King's novel years ago and I thought I remembered quite a different ending from the one the movie depicts.  After reading some of the reviews on Amazon I see I remembered correctly.   One annoyance I had with the film it is supposed to be set in Maine but it is rather obviously filmed in Northern California.  And of course though I realize rabid animals are very dangerous would a dying dog really become a single minded killing machine like Cujo?  This is a decent movie that does have some really gripping scenes though I'd call it more of a thriller or suspense film than real horror and there really isn't anything overtly supernatural.  And if nothing else it might make you realize why they had to shoot Old Yeller.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have watched many versions of Jane Eyre recently and somehow hadn't heard about this one til just a few weeks ago. I saw a few clips on youtube and decided I really liked what I had seen, so I bought it. I was SO happy with this movie. While other versions may not take enough liberties with the book (as Toby Stephens said, some of Rochester's melodrama does not translate well to film) and some may take too many, I found this movie did everything right.     Ruth Wilson is the Jane Eyre I've been waiting for and Toby Stephens is the Rochester I've always dreamed of. I don't know how BBC managed to hit the nail on the head so hard. The movie is so eerie and beautiful that it left a strong impression on me, and thought its several hours long I happily watched it over and over.    On the cover it says \\"Just the right amount of heaving bodices\\"-- and I could not agree more. I have read many people say this version keeps with the spirit of the novel with the few liberties it takes, and having more physical interactions between Rochester and Jane are one of those liberties. It works so well, leaves nothing to be desired.    Other good things: Pilot is a haunting dog, Ms Fairfax, Blanche Ingram, Mrs. Ingram are all very well casted, the twin metaphor was beautiful, the gypsy scene made much more sense (another one of those 'works in book but not necissarily on film' liberties), and of course Toby Stephens is the most perfect Rochester I could ever dream up (so wonderful he possibly has taken the place in my heart of Colin Firth's Darcy...and I swore to lock my heart up for him forever!)    The only issue I had: The little girl playing Adele was not a very good actress, and I couldn't even tell if she was actually French

B000OYC7A8|1.0|If it's Roger Waters or David Gilmour ...It all sounds the same , nothing new on this 2-set DVD other than special Guset...Grosby & Nash and then David Bowie.....at the end on 2 songs..I say it was a waste on money $$$$<br />as nothing can replace the group \\"Pink Floyd\\" with all four of the original member... Don't get me wrong I like David Gilmour ...But all he does is have special guest and try to sound like  it's \\"Pink Floyd\\" And it is NOT..........................
1592332803|5.0|So I have a lot of Vegan cookbooks and this one is the BEST.  So far the recipes have lived up to the promise, which I cannot say for some of my other books.  This cookbook also uses less obscure ingredients.  I live in New York City and even I find it difficult to find some of the ingredients in other vegan baking books.   Can't say enough good things about this book.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!
B0014ERKO0|4.0|When I heard that this movie was coming out, it became an automatic BUY for my SG-1 collection. How can you END a series without coming to terms with the newest bad guy?    This movie satisfied my yearn for them to complete the story. I found out that I missed a couple of the episodes leading up to this one...but there is a little 'wrap up' available inside this DVD.    I, too, was 'satisfied' by how this storyline was eventually completed. As usual, the special effects are top notch.    If you just don't want to buy it, I've found my local video rental store stocks these.    What do I do now that the SG-1 series is over? Ah, yes...there's alway Stargate Atlantis!
1569242739|5.0|Simple to follow recipes with amazing results.  Perfect for non-vegans, no one believes me that anything I have made from this cookbook is Vegan!  Highly recommend!  Great photos and step by step instructions, perfect for the non-experienced or experienced baker!
B000BTGY1O|5.0|I just saw this movie for the first time, and it was delightful.  I also read the book.  The stories follow very different paths, but I can't pick one over the other as a favorite.  Cheers to Truman Capote for coming up with character as charming as Holly Golightly.
B00003XAQ5|5.0|\\"Kind of Blue\\" is described by people who know a lot more about jazz than I do as the definitive jazz CD. It and \\"Coltrane Plays the Blues\\" are my two favorites.  Just can't beat Miles and the Trane.      Just put it in and leave it on the continuous play feature.  It's that good.      Rebecca Kyle, May 2008
B00005JPNZ|3.0|After seeing the seemingly endless trailers on TV, I suspected this film was going to be awful, but I had to see it because I enjoyed the others so much.  Well it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be and I did enjoy this one, but it really didn't come close to the others so I only gave it three stars -- sort of a gift for previous efforts.  I felt that they took ideas and incidents from the previous films, warmed them over, and pasted them together rather than coming up with a new idea.  The result is constant motion, constant action, unbelievable escapes,some of the worst marksmanship I have ever seen, and all of this punctuated by some dialog -- errr-- acting.  The entire film from start to finish was highly predictable, right down to the unfriendly natives, and the shocking realization about the kid.  However, I did enjoy the give and take between Ford and Allen and they contributed the only acting in the film.  But -- this is truly a comic book and realism shouldn't be expected or anticipated.<br /><br />The villains are led by a Russian Villainess -- of sorts -- sort of the Cat Woman in disguise. This character could have definitely used some remedial screen writing and the sword was cheesy right from the start.  As soon as you heard Mutt say he took fencing you knew the sword fight was coming -- foreshadowing at the sophomore level.  Still it was fun even if it wasn't surprising and none of these villains ever seemed very threatening or evil.<br /><br />Crystal skulls do exist and whether there are aliens from Roswell is unknown but connecting these two seemed a little bit of a stretch even for a comic book type movie. I think they could have found a better vehicle than aliens and flying saucers but maybe this is a salute to all of those 1950's sci-fi flicks.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and it was fun to watch, but as a professional endeavor it ranks right up there with the Star wars Prequels- disappointing.  The actors did a good job with a very poor screen play.  Unless the screenwriters can return to their previous quality I would say let this be the last Indiana Jones Adventure.  By all means see the movie, you'll enjoy it, but you'll see why I was disappointed.s the screenwriters can return to their previous quality I would say let this be the last Indiana Jones Adventure.

B00123IB32|4.0|The Pogues are up there with Fairport Convention as one of the top folk tradition/rock fusion bands. You can't listen to their upbeat songs without wanting to get up and dance and even the sad ones, like \\"Fairytale of New York\\" will bring an ironic smile to your lips.     This is an eclectic collection of traditionals and current music.      \\"Worms\\" you've heard the song before as a child, but not quite like this.    \\"Fairytale of New York,\\" this song, which is co-performed with Kirsty MacColl (daughter of Ewan), received fresh attention with the release of \\"PS I love you,\\" it's a bitter Christmas for an old man in a drunk tank:    I could have been someone  Well so could anyone  You took my dreams from me  When I first found you  I kept them with me, babe  I put them with my own  Can't make it all alone  I've built my dreams around you    \\"Streets of Sorrow/Birmingham Six\\" is the tale of some unfortunate Irishmen who were caught for a bombing they didn't do:    There were six men in Birmingham  In guildford theres four  That were picked up and tortured  And framed by the law  And the filth got promotion  But they're still doing time  For being Irish in the wrong place  And at the wrong time....    This CD is of many moods. You'll find something you like here regardless of how you are feeling. It's definitely one of this group's best and well worth having at the price.

0425188809|5.0|This is, quite simply, the best book i have ever read. The characters are complex yet believable and there is some true though that went into its writing, if you ask why koontz is my favorite author, i only need to reply with one word- Watchers
B000F5GO0A|5.0|Beirut has quickly joined the ranks of those artists whose music I listen to as I'm writing.  It's high praise.  What it means is that this album puts me in a frame of mind that unfetters my imagination.  While establishing this state, though, the album doesn't insist upon itself; it's not aggressive.  Like some songs you grew up hearing in your grandmother's kitchen, this collection creates a kind of nostalgia for things you can't quite remember.  I love it.
B00005JOFQ|2.0|For me, this movie was disappointing.  I have to give credit to the actors, they did an excellent job.  But I do feel that the relationship between the two characters, Jack and Enis, was a bit...rushed into.  I mean, how do you go from tending sheep...to sex.  There wasn't even the slightest show of interest between the two guys, except maybe in one scene.  It just didn't flow well enough there for me.    However, the rest of the movie was decent.  It goes on to show the struggle of the characters being forced to deny their love and to be apart (except the occasional visits), and managing wives and families.  Then, to top it all off, the ending really sucked.  I actually baught the movie  before seeing it in good faith that it was going to be beyond my expectations.  I gave the dvd away a day or so later.    So overall, i'd say this movie's entertaining, but nothing special.  The actors diserve every award/nomination that was given as a result of this film.  But as for the movie itself, at best, it's decent enough maybe to rent from your local movie store.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|I think the most telling thing I can say about this album is that I was thoroughly prepared not to like it after I read the band's self-described \\"upper west side soweto\\" sound.  I was indignant - \\"How much arrogance,\\" I thought, \\"can they possibly expect us to allow.\\"    Well, these days I've been spending a lot of time eating my words.  The songs are ridiculously catchy and artfully arranged.  They're delightful.  And, if that weren't enough, they cinched me by mentioning Mystic Seaport.  Be still my heart.  Oh, indie yacht club afro-pop...
B0010OMXKA|5.0|I like the duets played in that concert, and the scenario, wonderful. All of his music is so lovely, and sharing his music with all the world; his music gives me so much peace.
B000NDIAWY|4.0|This is such a beautiful album.  She has an angelic voice that I would describe as Joni Mitchell meets Sarah McLachlan. The perfect relaxing album or driving music.  The only thing that keeps this from a 5-star is the monotony of the overall sound.  Not a lot of music or voice diversity here.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|Vampire Weekend ****<br /><br />This is seriously a melting pot of sounds. When I listen to this I hear Peter Gabriel, Paul Simon, early Talking Heads, Joe Strummer & The Mescaleros, and most of all Elvis Costello. So while everyone is calling this a truly original sound, I know better, this is just a hodge-podge of world rhythms and eclectic sounds. But a damn good one.<br /><br />I picture Vampire Weekend being really big for the duration of this album, than for the rest of their career having a home on the cool rock radio station that actually plays more than whats big, which is where they belong because they are way to talented for the mainstream.<br /><br />Songs like the semi-wannabe-hit single 'A-Punk' 'Campus' and the Peter Gabriel name dropping 'Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa' are nothing short of genius if not trendy at the least. 'I Stand Corrected' could have been better in the way that Paul Simon's Graceland album was great but had even more potential, and 'The Kids Don't Stand A Chance' might be the best thing I have heard since Streetcore from The Mescaleros.<br /><br />The Latin and African influence on the rythms as well as instrumentation is well recieved and refreshing. The over all is rather good with room for minor improvement on tighting the screws. Vampire Weekend's debut will remain in my stereo for quite a while.
B000P12LWY|5.0|The story had me glued to the movie.  It is well written, costumes are beautiful and the actors are awesome.
B0007TKH66|1.0|It's official: I hate Star Trek Enterprise Season 1. I watched parts of later episodes a few years ago when it was on TV, and it seemed kind of OK compared to the other Trek shows which have come out in recent years. Season 1 is most emphatically not OK.<br /><br />In Season 1, Vulcan chick has the personality of celery. Tactical officer Englishman is an uptight tosser. Captain American likes puppy dogs. Communication neurotic ... why is she on this show? Doctor Flox is kind of cool in a perverted way. Engineer Redneck is pretty awesome, actually: first sympathetic modern unabashed redneck character on televisions. Ethnic complaint: everyone is an American except for the English guy. In old Star Trek, there was Japaneses, Zulus, Scotchmen and Russians. That ruled. This sucks.<br /><br />What is the plot of season-1? The plot is, Vulcans are bad, but maybe they're kind of good and need humans help to help them be better people. Back in the mists of Star Trek history, this sort of dynamic was probably designed to get smart people to think about being more filled with pep and ginger, and dynamic people to be more reflective and logical: this is probably a healthy moral lesson. Somehow that dimension has been lost, and it's turned into some pathetic psychotherapeutic point about being more sensitive. Other important plot device: golly that Vulcan chick is attractive. Seriously, the main plot device is adolescent sexual tension between Vulcan chick and the male members of the crew. While I bet this is popular with fans ... it's death to the story telling. I'm always thinking, \\"OK, now they're going to tie the Captain to the Vulcan girl, but she thinks he is stinky.\\" And it always happens: it is boring and juvenile.  More boring than the faceless guys in red always dying in the old episodes.<br /><br /> Storyline: I can't figure it out. Enterprise aimlessly wanders in space. Some scaly green dudes want to hurt people at the behest of the Mysterious Stranger from the Future. And, there are occasionally cool green dudes with antennas who find Vulcans to be as irritating as I find everyone on this show.  Enterprise Season 1 is what I imagine came out of a focus group of Trekkies. Old school Star Trek was the creation of Gene Roddenberry and his genius. It was Shakespearean in its human insight and moral lessons. This is just a compound of adolescent neuroses, soap opera and techno porn. The fragments of the old series show through: some of the plot is straight from old episodes, and the moments of dramatic tension often involve fixing the transporter and engines.<br /><br />My rating: phasers on bored and one half a green dancing alien girl.onally cool green dudes with antennas who find Vulcans to be as irritating as I find everyone on this show.

1401300529|4.0|This is a rather complete history of the times and battles.  Well written, if a bit turgid relating need historical context, and the author has definite opinions of the major characters: watch for that.
B00005JPNZ|3.0|Not bad love the action, shia lebouf (love him)but at times thought it drag on in the middle because i kind of fell asleep in the middle of the movie as well as my husband. so i would actually rate this 3.75 STARS. not BAD just not PERFECT still watchable and enjoyable. DON'T GET ME WRONG the action was great as well.
1592332803|4.0|Great recipes, taste just like their non vegan versions. Yet you can't mistake vegan for healthy. As in all baking there is lots of sugar and (vegan) butter which is basically margarine. But if you have a sweet tooth and want to keep vegan this is the book to bake with!!! It also helps if you want to convert a recipe into vegan, it explains or suggests substitutions. Worth having.

B0008KLVG4|4.0|Jaws is not really a favorite of mine, I first saw it on a date that didn't go all that well, and I was too angry too get the jump factor that the rest of the audience did. However, my family will all watch Jaws over and over at least once a year, so go figure.<br /><br />My cool anecdote about Jaws is from a couple of weeks after it came out, I was skin diving near Newport Beach, and as we swam out from shore, the sea weed was swaying in the water, my friend and I both looked at each other at the same time and through our snorkels, we sang \\"Doo, doo, doo-doo\\" That day they caught a baby Great White between where we were and Catalina Island, the next day a world record Great White off of Catalina. It did keep us out of the water the rest of the week!<br /><br />So here's the deal, this is a scary movie, but don't look too close at the special effects, as they are pretty cheesy by today's standards, and on a side note, Myth Busters tried to re- create the Blow Up scene... Myth busted!
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|The tracklist on my car stereo moved silently from 12 back to 1, and I knew I had heard something extraordinary.  As others have stated, you can hear a youthful exhuberance in Donna Summer's voice on the \\"Crayons\\" cd that was lacking on previous one-off tracks (Power of Love, I Will Go With You, etc.) she had recorded.  She seems genuinely in control of the project this time as opposed to attempting yet another comeback.  In the process, the comeback is her richly deserved reward.  Regardless if you consider her just a \\"disco queen\\" (although she has a grammy for Rock performance by a female), the power and versatility of her voice cannot be denied when listening to \\"Crayons\\".    Stamp Your Feet - The cheerleader spelling is a bit over the top, but by the time you hit the chorus, you're singing along with this \\"perfect for summer\\" tune. 9/10    Mr. Music - Although some say the hiphop style is somewhat outdated, I beg to differ.  First of all, the song is very catchy (I love Music...I love it, I love it), and I don't need to be part of the East vs. West crews to appreciate a song that even pays tribute to Meredith Wilson's \\"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\\".  This time around, Donna's unsinkable. 8/10    Crayons - Reggae and Ziggy Marley?  Brilliant!  Take a walk on the wild side and pick up this cd.  8/10    The Queen is Back - Again, one critic stated the cd is devoid of catchy hooks, although I hear 3 distinctly infectious stanzas in this one song.  Overlapping them in the end is just icing on the cake.  Wow...she really is back!  10/10    Fame (The Game) - Challenging to try to sing along with the frenetic pace of the lyrics.  I can't help but think of Britney, Paris & Lindsay when I hear this awesome track.  10/10    Sand on My Feet - This is definitely hit worthy.  It shows the diverse nature of Donna's voice.  I hear it and I think of Shania Twain's \\"Forever and For Always\\".  Great love song.  8/10    Drivin' Down Brazil - Catchy...not my most favorite, but still very cool.  7/10    I'm A Fire - The teaser track that gave Donna a #1 dance track for each of the past 4 decades.  Smooth, slick, and oh so commercial.  Excellent.  9/10    Slide Over Backwards - What a bizarre song.  Donna's voice is wild on this one.  The first time I heard it, I was like \\"what the hell\\"?, but after a couple listens it's pretty cool actually too.  6/10    Science of Love - Single worthy again...Fun, electronic and upbeat (as is most of the cd), without being faddish.  9/10    Be Myself Again - Anyone who knows how Donna's image was formulated in the 70's and how she became the \\"queen of love\\" because of \\"Love To Love You, Baby\\" has to hear this song.  It shows the dramatic side of being caught up in an image where the reflection isn't always what's projected, and you lose part of yourself in the process.  Simply beautiful.  10/10    Bring Down The Reign - My least favorite on the cd, although it's okay.  Just tired of the children's choruses on Donna tunes.  Beautiful sentiment and Donna's donating proceeds to Darfur, but it's just okay for me.  6/10    It's Only Love - AWESOME  AWESOME AWESOME.  This is a substitute track for \\"Fame (The Game)\\" in some markets, but it needed to be on the cd as well.  It's amazing.  9/10    Overall, this is back to form (Bad Girls, The Wanderer) for someone who's voice and talent are so underrated by the public and by radio (play the songs already!).  Rock, Disco, Dance, Gospel, R&B, Soul, Pop...I ask you...what can't she sing?  10/10 overall for \\"Crayons\\"

0307120007|5.0|This book should be read to every new baby ... I've read it a million times for my own children ... and presented it to new parents. It is a book the baby will love through the years!!
B0014CQNTK|5.0|The soundtrack to this movie was enough to make me want to run screaming from the theater, but once the long introduction was finally over, I became charmed by the film despite my instant prejudice.   The script was so witty, sarcastic and intelligent, that I forgave it its musical selections.  A little.  I guess they added to the mood of the film in that the songs were kinda grungy and featured strung out teens doggedly singing without a shred of musical ability.  Despite it's musical failings, this is probably one of my favorite movies EVER.  I have rarely laughed so hard in my life.  I recomend this movie to anyone and everyone.
B00005JLD4|4.0|Based on true story.  Set in 1930's in western Australia.  Aboriginal children, fathered and abandoned by white workers, were pulled from the aboriginal mothers and herded into camps 1500 miles away - where they were forced to give up their native language, culture and customs.  Ultimately they are held in this camp until they were re-settled as cheap labor.    Molly Craig (14) and her 2 of her young cousins, Daisy and Gracie, aged 8 and 10, were three of these children.  They ran away from the camp to make their 1500 mile trek home on foot over a span of 9 weeks.  They were pursued by Aboriginal trackers hired by the Government along with the army and police.  The story shows the incredible determination and persistence of the girls to get back to their mothers in addition to the persistence of the Government to recapture them.    Terrific cinematography and casting.  Very moving story where I learned part of Australia's unflattering history...
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|How would the teens of Dawson's Creek or the recent Juno speak like if they were English in the year 1797?  Look no further than Pride and Prejudice, one of the greatest love stories ever told and the original template for essentially every modern chick-flick or romantic comedy to come henceforth.<br /><br />At first I thought the movie was rather talky and somewhat boring, but the more i watched and the more I paid attention, I started to realize that this is one of the most engaging and accurately lavish English period pieces I have ever seen before.<br /><br />But it is not for everyone.  Certainly notsomuch as Atonement is for more general audiences or more easily digestible.  This film requires a more expert level of movie watching/comprehension and a certain degree of literary aptitude.  It begs for, nay demands the viewers active participation, involvement, and a certain commitment of attention more novice pieces would dare not request.  And by literary aptitude I don't necessarily mean the source novel as much as I mean Shakespeare.  The characters relate and converse in a pseudo-Shakespearean manner minus the iambic pentameter.  If you cannot keep up with all of the double entendras, doublespeak, subliminal messages and the like you will likely have a difficult time appreciating the genius of this screenplay written by Deborah Moggach.<br /><br />The complicated relationships and plot are also like a Shakespearan comedy (all though at times feels like a tragedy) and it is very easy to get left behind if you are not of to task.  This is why I enjoyed the movie so much.  You need to pay full attention to fully appreciate this work of art.  Visually there were many hidden cues like actors' not-always-so-obvious facial expressions as well as unspoken hints from the brilliant, however also purposeful wardrobe and costume design.  It's very difficult to explain in a simple way, but I simply love this director's work; Joe Wright is stupid genius!<br /><br />What a guilty pleasure for a moviephille for me to watch.<br /><br />And let us not even mention the name Keira Knightley.  This is the film that finally put her on the map as a serious actress to be reckoned with and not just another pretty face.  She thoroughly shines throughout as the star and primary protagonist of the movie.<br /><br />Director Joe Wright's second motion picture 'Atonement' was extrmely good, a modern classic in its own right, but it was not exactly a happy story.  It did not make me smile inside as the subtle and not-so-subtle humor like P&P did.  This one was more a romp that leaves one giddy so giddyup!<br /><br />note:  This was my first treatment of P&P.  I never saw any other version or read the book, but now I have decided to gobble up all of Jane Austen's other famous works and find myself feverishly awaiting Joe Wright's forthcoming film 'The Soloist'<br /><br />My Addendum:<br />I have been perusing the 1 star reviews that are speckeled among the many praising and applauding reviews of this movie and I just wanted to say something to address those naysayers.  First of all, I think you all have lost much prospective and are waging your 1 star rating for hyperbolic effect.  And second, if all of you who loathed this adaptation were in charge of all other adaptations in Hollywood, movies would just plain suck and not really be viable or marketable at all.  Thank goodness this is not the state of things.  It is more palatable movies such as this that satisfy the masses that draw in new viewers to your precious A&E/BBC version or bring in new readers to the original novel.  Is that such a horrible thing?  I swear so many rabid Austen fans think P&P was written only for them and belongs to them and if it isn't the approved 1995 edition of the miniseries, well then thee be damned.  Chill out already and stop trying to ruin it for the rest of us.  You should all be thanking the director Joe Wright because thanks to him (eventually) more people in the world will get to know who the heck Colin Firth even is!
B0013KTGAG|4.0|It did a great job of bringing you into the story, had some amazing visuals and quite a few unexpected plot twists that kept me on the edge of my seat.  The odd mixing of campy horror and hard core sci-fi did feel a little out of place but overall I dug it.  Very good movie.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|It's hard to find a reason to buy this CD for a long time Beatles fan like me, who owns all their entire catalog. I admit that I would never buy such a compilation, but finally I did because I've found a reason: the remastered sound. The songs sounds better than ever and certainly the sound of this CD has no comparison with the released official albums. If Apple or EMI someday decide to update the sound of all Beatles CD's the way they did with this one, I would no doubt to replace mi collection.
0316067601|5.0|This book should be required reading for schools across our nation.  We should all share in the bravery, courage, compassion, dedication and  pride in and of our fighting forces.   This book made me laugh, cry, happy, sad, and everything else in between!  I could not put it down, and read it straight through.  I only wish I had heard about it earlier! All Americans should be made aware of what we are up against.  My husband went over during the first Gulf War, and recently survived cancer treatment--likely caused by chemicals/biologicals in Iraq!  All Americans should read this book - maybe then they could really and truly understand what our military and their families give up willingly for all of our freedoms.  To the author, and his team, words cannot express, so I'll end with a heartfelt thank you - our entire military are all true heros.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Love the songs on this CD.  I am hooked on \\"Everything\\" and I listen to it over and over.
B00005ATQD|5.0|I have to give this movie five stars because of the lovely Nicole Kidman.  But she's not the only gorgeous girl in the movie and there are none of those acursed artificial breast implants either.  Stanley Kubrick really gave us something to cherish as his final work.<br /><br />The movie starts out (and remains) strange and it has a sort of ghost like quality which is set around Christmas time.  It touches on both the positive and negative aspects of sexually related issues and contains a lot of symbolism.<br /><br />Alice has a few glasses of champagne at some rich guy's party which puts her more or less out of her mind and she starts talking in a trance like state and dancing with this guy who looks like Count Dracula.<br /><br />Alice gets stoned and tells Dr. Bill about a fantasy she had about making out with this guy who she instantly fell in love with at first sight.  I don't think this ever really happened but Dr. Bill thinks it may have and he starts visualizing these wonderful (but not to him) scenes in his mind.  This is what causes him to start looking for love in all the wrong places as he also wants to experience that instantaneous and magical attraction.<br /><br />I sort of relate personally to the Dr. Bill character (Cruise) although this may only be my imagination.  Still I don't think think people would disagree that the movie contains some sort of hidden and secret message.<br /><br />Dr. Bill and his wife Alice sometimes think about doing the wrong things but ultimately they are not truly evil people as most people aren't.<br /><br />However Dr. Bill injects himself into a situation where the people are truly evil.

B000R7HY0K|5.0|In Death Proof QT manages to stroke himself and all his glory nearly as much as he did with Kill Bill.  it's Trantino's party ahd he'll do whatever he damn well pleases.  Here he takes on his biggest challenge: an omage to his own directoral style.  Tarantion is forced to ask himself, \\"What would QT  do if he was tasked to do an ode to grindhouse cinema?\\"  i could just hear Robert Rodiguez's voice chanting in the background adding encouragement, \\"Go Quentin, it's your birthday, etc.\\"<br /><br />We get all the perks you might expect from such a diversion:<br /><br />-A nearly unhealthy dose  of Tarantinism filled dialouge<br />-Great muscle cars<br />-A funky soundtrack filled with many of the greatest songs many of us have never heard before<br />-Lots of girls you might not expect to be so attractive in that girl-next-door kind of way.<br /><br />QT delivers what he always does:  His finest.<br /><br />Oh, and I almost forgot;  He also squirts out some of the best stunt scenes ever in the post CGI era and one of the best car chases since Bullitt (1968).
B0012DIQ5U|1.0|After all the positive reviews and my wife away for a few days I thought I'd geek out on some animated sci-fi goodness but . . . yikes!  I couldn't tell what was going on about. . . 90% of the time.  The \\"animation\\" most of the time consisted of slightly panning stills where only the character's bottom lip would wiggle slightly. . .  Robot nurses with dental floss for uniforms?  Robots that act like little kids and get NO reaction from anyone with this behavior!?!  People putting \\"cyber\\" parts in their brain that can be hacked just by receiving a call phone call?  Did none of you watch this?  It was utter stupidity. . . Big thumbs down for me.
B0006J28KU|5.0|This is a great film. It's characters are rich, complex and dark. It's visuals are stunning and modern. And it has both Al Pacino and Robert De Niro churning out amazing performances. This is a crime epic that follows the lives of both the criminals and the cops. It relates the two sides and compares there moral codes, revealing their similarities. Heat is an amazingly complex character study. Every character is three dimensional and that makes the action that much more intense. Speaking of action Heat has several of the best action scenes on film including an amazing bank heist and shootout filmed in downtown L.A. This is a Michael Mann masterpiece I highly recommend it.

B00000251N|5.0|It's good to see the renewed interest in Neil Diamond's work.  Although most people know him via his hits during the 60s, 70s and early 80s, this album is completely different from most of his other recordings.      I heard this album the first time a few years after its release and despite a young age got hooked on it.  It has a majestic feel all over, as if it flew over the musical landscape of its period, and probably would do the same even if being released today.  One could claim that it gave signals of the new age sound that later developed.  In other words, it has aged remarkably well.    Anyone who has any of his compilations and actually listens to them should not let this Jonathan Livingston pass them by.  Even those who do not have any interest in Diamond's other work may enjoy this album.  It is timeless and a constant pleasure.

0143038419|1.0|This review should be zero stars.  I had such high hopes for this book, but I only finished it because it was our book club's selected reading.  The constant whining and crying (good gracious, in what country is she sobbing now?) was almost too much to bear.    Never have I read a story by such a self-centered, narcissistic author who genuinely believes her readers should have some sympathy for her.  I whole-heartedly agree with all of the other reviewers in their descriptions of the disaster that this book is.  Save your money and don't bother with this book.
B000UR9T7I|4.0|After two hugely successful films, \\"Spiderman\\" and \\"Spiderman 2\\" respectively, Sony Pictures `Spiderman' franchise was definitely at the top of its game entering into the third, and for the moment, the supposed final chapter in the `Spiderman' series, at least as far as stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst may be concerned (their contracts were only good for three movies). So, with the primary cast assembled once again, Sam Raimi back in the director's chair, and also serving as co-writer with his brother Ivan and acclaimed writer Alvin Sargent (\\"Spiderman 2\\"), the latest chapter for good ol' web head was shaping up to be just as epic, and no doubt visually amazing, as its predecessors. Throw in a few more villains than usual, Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), Venom (Topher Grace), and New Goblin (James Franco), to mess with Spidey's life and loves, along with a certain black space goo that will bring out the worst in Peter's psyche, and Spiderman may just be in for a bigger fight than even he can handle. Not to mention the fact that Peter Parker/Spiderman, and all those aforementioned talented people responsible for bringing the character to life, must face the daunting task of attempting to top the first 2 films; but hey, superheroes are used to the odds being stacked against them so this film may have ended up being just business as usual for Spidey, but only time would tell.    \\"Spiderman 3\\" begins with Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) becoming swept up in his own hype as the citizens of New York are embracing a sort of Spidey-mania craze. As happy as Peter Parker/Spiderman's life seems to be, events are being set into motion that will soon bring him down off of his high. Peter's girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is having difficulty finding success on Broadway, and with Peter's newfound arrogance, she is slowly beginning to get jealous of his rising popularity. Also, Peter's former best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), has embraced his father's dark waysand has become the New Goblin, and his only goal is to see Spiderman pay for his father's death. As if this old friend turned new villain, and the possibility of losing his longtime love wasn't enough to deal with, a new super-villain is created in the form of the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). To top things off a strange alien substance has landed on Earth, and has found a kind of kindred spirit in the newly arrogant Spiderman, and as it bonds to its new host, the alien symbiote begins to slowly corrupt Spidey's soul, until he no longer knows who he truly is any longer. This time the odds may just be too much for Spiderman to handle by himself.    If there is one thing that can be said about \\"Spiderman 3\\" that audiences and critics everywhere can agree on, it's the fact that this film is definitely the biggest in the franchise thus far. That aside, \\"Spiderman 3\\" found our hero not just in new territory by facing more than one villain in the film, but also finding himself disliked by many movie critics and audiences. Where the first two films were universally liked by everyone, this movie split audiences fairly even in their reactions to it. Many felt the story was far too bloated, with way too many new characters introduced, which resulted in uneven character development in some instances, giving the movie a disjointed feel that lacked the smooth flow of the previous two films and even made it a little difficult to follow. Another problem some audiences had was that the movie seemed to focus more on action than on the personal dramas being played out by the characters, not to mention the ending left people a little cold due to some corny dialogue between Peter and Harry, and a somewhat sappy and unbelievable resolution to the Sandman conflict. For those that enjoyed the movie, there were still some gripes that were shared with those that disliked it, but for the most part the gripes didn't seem to affect their view of the movie too much. I for one enjoyed \\"Spiderman 3\\", but found it to be the least enjoyable out of the series so far, still it's better than a lot of the action movies that Hollywood churns out. I agreed with some of the sentiments from those that hated the movie, but found some of their thoughts to be off in my opinion. Where I agree the most with those that disliked the film, is in the disappointing resolution to Sandman's conflict with Spiderman, especially in light of events that had occurred moments before between the two characters, but apparently Sam Raimi and his writers liked the resolution, though one does wonder why. Although, it did seem as if the writers were trying too hard to top themselves, which is a possible explanation for why this movie had so much going on, I must disagree with those who found the movie to be too hard to follow or lacked any sense of flow, apparently those audience members must not have been paying attention during the movie.    The cast for \\"Spiderman 3\\" continues the tradition of excellence that this series had set forth with the very first movie. Tobey Maguire once again portrays the dual persona of Peter Parker/Spiderman, and this time he gets to show off a new side to Peter that had previously remained untapped, which would be his darker side. This element to the character's story arc was on one hand one of the true highlights of the film, but on the other was one of the film's weak points. I enjoyed seeing an angrier, more aggressive Spiderman, and the black suit definitely looked sleek and cool; however, I grew tired of Peter's darker side being essentially an uber-nerd, granted this is most likely true to character, but a little less of this side could have been shown and I would have been much happier, I especially could have done with some editing during the sequence where Peter is checking out all of the ladies on the streets of New York (too much cheese for my taste). Kirsten Dunst looked much better as Mary Jane Watson in this film than she did in \\"Spiderman 2\\",I don't know what happened in the previous movie, but she looked way too pale and even a little unattractive, not to mention the redness in her hair didn't even come close to matching her color in the first film. Thankfully, the make-up and wardrobe department must have heard the complaints from moviegoers that felt the same way about her in \\"Spiderman 2\\", and appeared to work harder at matching the hair color from the first film, and actually applying make-up and putting her in clothes that were more stylish and attractive. I mean come on, this is a girl who is supposed to be an actress, yet she dressed in such an unattractive manner that I didn't like seeing her on screen that much, so it was a welcome adjustment in that respect. From a character standpoint, Mary Jane didn't seem to evolve much over the course of this film, her anger at Peter was understandable in certain instances, but in others seemed rather juvenile and out of character. James Franco seemed to really come into his own with Harry Osborn this time around, as he embraced the darker side of his character to become the New Goblin. Other returning favorites, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, and Rosemary Harris as Aunt May, were enjoyable as always, but I found myself wishing for a little bit more Jonah when this film was all said and done. Joining the cast was Thomas Haden Church (\\"Sideways\\") as the villainous Sandman, he definitely looked the part, but sadly he wasn't given as much to do as I would have hoped and his character felt a little underused in favor of giving more attention to the other villains in the story. TV star Topher Grace (\\"That 70's Show\\") was perfect as the smooth-talking and morally challenged, Eddie Brock, who begins to develop a hatred for Peter Parker and Spiderman, and eventually comes into contact with the very alien symbiote that is plaguing Peter to become one of comic book fans favorite Spiderman villains of all time, Venom. I enjoyed the addition of Venom as a villainfor Spidey, but I thought that he would have been better suited to be the only villain in the movie, rather than sharing the stage with two others, plus I wish they would have chosen to have Venom speak more in his monstrous form instead of having the symbiote pull back to show Topher's face a majority of the time... oh well, nothing's perfect I guess.    Another highlight for \\"Spiderman 3\\" and the previous two films as well, were the numerous visual effects employed throughout the course of the movie. The effects department was definitely at the top of their game for this movie, the fight scenes were visually stunning and exhilarating, moving at an almost break-neck speed. The CGI for Sandman and Venom was among some of the best I have ever seen captured on film, and you could definitely see that no expense was spared in bringing these popular characters to the screen, and audiences absolutely loved it, regardless of what their overall opinion on the movie may have been.    In the end, \\"Spiderman 3\\" was an entertaining installment in the franchise, and would be a fitting end to this hero's journey if that is what is decided. However, I must agree that the story did seem a bit bloated at times and some judicious editing could have been done to smooth things out a little more. Although there were times that I found myself wishing for things to have gone differently over the course of the film, overall I enjoyed the experience of watching this movie, and will continue to enjoy it time and time again.    \\"Spiderman 3\\" is rated PG-13 for mild language and violence.

B0002UOK04|5.0|This album is the definition of ''Epic'' in music. Every single song on this album is a masterpeice. Each song is filled with amazing, mind thrilling lyrics and  beautiful works of music. Jari Maenpaa has impressed me like ive never been impressed before. Weather it is Harsh vocals or Clean singing, Jari has all of the talent in the world to provide us with a mind blowing album. The way that the songs range in tempo such as in ''Beyond the Dark Sun'' to  a slower tempo in ''Death in the Healing'' shows me how diverse and original of a songwriter Jari is. I HIGHLY reccomend this album to anyone.
B00005JPNZ|1.0|What a disappointment!<br /><br />The first movie, \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" is just about perfect.  A terrific tale culled from Judeo-Christian mythology subverted by the core obsession of Hitler's occultic desperation.  Talk about good versus evil!  That was 27 years ago!<br /><br />But after a 19 year wait from the last Indiana  Jones movie and numerous official screenplays commissioned and then rejected by George Lucas, it is hard to believe that this is the absurd, overblown story that was finally agreed on by Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford. What happened to Frank Darabont's version?<br /><br />What \\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is really about is three old men looting their fans' wallets with a highly anticipated and  decidedly empty parody of the original entry.  Did anyone have his heart in this enterprise?  A better title would be \\"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of Your Wallet.\\"<br /><br />Shame.<br /><br />Nice atom bomb effect, though.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|After all the gritty, raw-edged tragedies I have seen this past few months, I did not expect to like George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg's latest installment to the iconic Indiana Jones series, \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\".<br /><br />But I did.<br /><br />Yes, the characters are older, but aren't we all?  Heck, my son wasn't even born when the first Indiana Jones adventure came out in 1981.  Harrison Ford's Indie sports a little grizzle around the muzzle, but he still snaps a mean whip, gets a lot of action dropping his trademark fedora and apparently can blow a mean horn as being a man few women forget.  Age seems to agree with him, however, he's wiser, a bit mellower--the cynicism so intrinsic to the earlier character toned down--and just as much of a klutz as he is an impulsive hero.  His moments with a certain reptilian creature sparked involuntary amusement in me--after all he is Indiana Jones, a cinematic icon, as familiar to me as Superman and Batman--so why wouldn't I instantly want to hunker down in the plush-ness of my movie theatre seat, wallow in popcorn and just enjoy?<br /><br />Likewise, the rest of Indie's band of adjuncts falls in line in a beloved formula again recognizable to the audience.  Shia La Bouef as Mutt Williams emulates a likeable sidekick--his fifties panache evident in his `Route 66' habit of combing his would-be greaser ducktail at the most unlikely times.  As the film's young beefcake (as his last name implies,) Shia unfortunately has some of the film's sillier interludes--his entrance on motorbike donned in Marlon Brando's \\"The Wild One\\" regalia, his acrobatic foray with a group of coiffed Amazonian monkeys and his exhibition of fencing skills while balancing precariously on racing jeeps may suspend belief, but only for a few seconds as the audience again gets a grip and realizes that Spielberg delivers exactly what is expected--family fun targeted to capture multi-generations.<br /><br />Karen Allen, as love interest Marion Ravenwood, impressed me the least--as the independent woman depicted in `Raiders', now seasoned and tempered by time and life she should have toyed with Indie a bit--more banter--more anger--more tension--she caved a little too fast for my sensibilities--she too should have had a little more fun with him.  What I did find admirable about Ms. Allen is her authenticity--yes, she is no longer the fresh cheeked ing&eacute;nue, but, thank heavens, she has not opted for a plastic Botoxed face and the other sickeningly vain accoutrements of pseudo-sophistication that so many older actresses seem to find necessary to compete in a marketplace obsessed with youth.  Refreshingly, Ms Allen revels in her crow's feet--her beaming smile a testament to real inner beauty.<br /><br />Cate Blanchard comes as close to embodying Natasha Fatale of Rocky & Bullwinkle fame as arch-villainess Irina Spalko as it gets--she's more cartoon than actual woman, playing campy with a capital \\"C\\"---but who cares?  Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?  These characters are supposed to be larger than life, like the serials from the 30s. Blanchard sure seems to be having a good time goose-stepping it up with a sword at her jumpsuit belt.  All chiseled cheekbones and manic eyes when she sites the answer to her heart's craving for power, she certainly doesn't seem to care if the audience laughs at her or not--she anticipates it--its all part of the caricature--putting the \\"E\\" into Evil.<br /><br />Bottom line?  \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" delivers pretty much what one would expect from an Indiana Jones installment.  Fun, campy, corny, chuck full of improbable stunts, raucous chases and a wild storyline that reaches resolution in just over two hours, this film oscillates with pure fun.  The intermingling of the Sci-Fi with the archaeological lends a dash of signature Lucas to an already appealing hero that is probably better known than Homer's Odysseus.

0060599847|5.0|I discovered Jack Canfield through the Chicken Soup for the Soul series.  I love reading but don't have time to read more than two books per month so I bought this audio book.  I love it!  Jack has an upbeat voice and a contagious positive attitude.  I listen to The Success Principles as I drive to work, and it fills me with energy and motivation.  The principles are simple to apply and touch many areas: goal setting, action planning, finance, and many more.  Listening to it on my way home also gives me time to relax and focus on myself.<br /><br />Jack talks about each principle in only 10 to 15 minutes so no matter what your commute is, you can listen to him and gain from it!  I have no problem stopping in the middle of a principle as my auto radio starts it back exactly where I stopped... very much like a book.<br /><br />I asked my daughter, 15, to listen to one of the principles with me, which talked about visualization.  It helped her through her tests :-)<br /><br />Congratulations Jack for your great work!  And I hope I can hear you in person one day when you come to France or Switzerland for a conference.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Excellent album. Impressed with Duffy's distinctive vocals, and her song writing. Really enjoying this album -- something where there is a good deal of thought and effort to create an artistic work rather than a few catchy songs with filler tunes. Best album I have heard for a long time. Makes me think a bit about Ricky Lee Jones in that the voice is distinctive and the singer is really contributing to the artistic process rather than being \\"produced\\". Five stars. My one complaint is the sound engineering has made the sound muddy. Perhaps this is because songs today are engineered with less dynamics so they sound good on iPods. However, this quality of artistry deserves better. Alternatively it may simply be poor engineering (lack of funds?) from the start. Duffy, if you read this, lets hope you demand \\"throw back dynamics\\" on your next album -- something where the background sounds and singers stand out, and your great voice is in front of it all. My hopes are, like Ricky Lee Jones, your next album maintains the artistry. Finally, being of Welsh decent I'm always happy that such a great musical culture continues to produce great talent. Maybe a Duffy/Bryn Terfel duet?? That's be too cool if someone could pull it off (artistically)!!<br /><br />Edit: Don't mean for my comments on sound quality to diminish my recommendation. In some ways this is the time we live in re: compressed sound on mastered recordings. Sad, but until consumers care, it will go on. Album is still very worth the purchase. Since buying an MP3 or AAC version will add additional compression, reason enough to buy the full CD.
078324228X|4.0|\\"Oh I'll always be the `Hurricane'\\", and a hurricane is beautiful.\\"   The Hurricane, starring Denzel Washington and directed by Norman Jewison, was released on March 16, 2000 in Hong Kong. The movie tells the story of Rubin `Hurricane' Carter, a world famous African-American boxer convicted for the murder of three whites in Patterson, New Jersey. The antagonist is Della Pesca, played by Dan Hedaya, a racist white detective out to get Rubin Carter.   During the summer of 1966, two black men entered a bar and murdered three white men. Rubin Carter and John Artis were arrested and convicted. After nineteen years in prison, Rubin Carter was freed by Judge Lee Sarokin under the ruling that \\"the prosecution had appealed to racism over reason\\" in 1985.   As a movie, The Hurricane is brilliant. It keeps the audience interested and builds empathy for Rubin Carter as the film progresses. The intensity increases at the right moments, such as when Carter calls the Canadians and tells them that he \\"can't do it anymore\\", and is ready to give up on his freedom. The acting is superb with Denzel Washing, the perfect choice for the role of Rubin Carter. He displays the character's emotions and dignity colorfully and effectively. One scene that will be etched forever in the audience's mind is the speech Carter gave the judge before the decision is made to free Carter. Although this speech was fictional, the words \\"Don't turn away from the truth. Don't turn away from your conscience. Please, don't ignore the law. No, embrace that higher principle for which the law was meant to serve: justice - that's all I ask, Your Honor - justice\\" sends shivers down the audience's spine. Another scene where Denzel Washington manages to show the dignity Carter held is when he refuses to take a shower in order to avoid wearing a prisoner's uniform. The movie is presented in such a way that the audience will always side with Rubin Carter.   As a docudrama, The Hurricane is lacking in historical evidence. There are many scenes in the movie that deviate from what actually happened. For example, in the movie, Officer Della Pesca arrests John Artis and Rubin Carter without extensive evidence right away. In reality, it was several months before they were arrested because the police were building a case. They found two bullet shells in Carter's car. Artis and Carter's alibis also didn't match up: Carter claimed that he was leaving his house at 10:00 pm while Artis said that he was arriving at Club La Petit with Carter at 10:00 pm.   Some evidence against Carter is completely left out of the movie, such as the fact that Carter failed a lie detector test during his first trial. The night before his second trial, Carter was given an offer: Take a second lie detector test, pass it, and the charges would be dropped. Carter refused, raising the question why, when he could have been freed easily. At the end of the film, Rubin Carter is exonerated, contrary to reality. The actual ruling was that \\"the prosecution erred in advancing a motive theory not supported by the evidence\\" (Capitalism Magazine p. 3). Furthermore, in the movie, Carter says that his first two trials had a jury of all whites. Yet, in reality, the jury of the second trial had two black people.   In the movie, Officer Della Pesca, real name Vincent DeSimone, is portrayed as a racist who is determined to put Carter in prison. In reality, Vincent DeSimone was the opposite of his portrayal in the film: he was religious and didn't swear. He was not a racist. DeSimone also died many years prior to the release of Rubin Carter, so the last scene in the movie where Della Pesca frowns is complete dramatic license.   In order to create the empathy felt for Carter in the movie, it is understandable for the filmmakers to write up scenes and alter the facts. The Hurricane sends a powerful message about racism and corruption in the American legal system, but does not completely qualify to be a docudrama. These fabrications detract from the true story, because they make the audience believe that Carter is innocent. When the audience hears the true story and all the lies by Carter, they will still believe that he is the innocent man of considerable dignity as portrayed in the movie. In docudramas, some amount of dramatic license must be taken, otherwise they become documentaries. In the case of The Hurricane however, there seems to have been too much dramatic license.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|Everyone has heard of Beatrix Potter--author of over twenty children's stories featuring the likes of tiny rabbits dressed in sweet blue waistcoats with brass buttons and fussy ducks bonneted in gingham and lace.  In \\"Miss Potter,\\" director Chris Noonan of talking pig, \\"Babe,\\" fame, does a fine job of recreating some of this quirky author's personal story featuring a charming romance that she had with her publisher, Norman Warne, and her apparent love of conservation as illustrated in the 4000 acres of Lake District property she left to Britain's National Trust.<br /><br />\\"Miss Potter,\\" played resiliently by the unflappable Renee Zellweger, sparkles as gleefully as a cheery-cheeked chipmunk.  Eccentric indeed, the script has her pegged as half marriage-eschewing suffragette and half talking fearlessly to her animal creations that double as her only friends in a turn-of-the-century world that did not look kindly on spinsters who wanted to make their own way in life.  In her mid-thirties, Miss Potter definitely epitomizes \\"over the hill'\\" as her parents all too fondly remind her.  Her decision to have her \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit,\\" published catapults the film's story into action, introducing Beatrix to Norman (a delightfully understated but earnest Ewan MacGregor still sounding wonderfully like a young Sir Alec Guiness), the Warne brother with little experience other than his family name in the matter of bringing the \\"Bunny Book\\" to print.  Together, they make quite the feisty team--she struggling to shrug off the role with which society and her parents encumber her, and he forging on to make big something his brothers deem a sentimental fluff piece in comparison to other offerings in their literary empire.<br /><br />Quite charmingly, they fall in love, amidst Noonan's whimsical animation of Beatrix's lovingly rendered characters.  Jemima Puddleduck mischievously bats her eyes and swishes her rear as Norman inspects her portrait.  Peter refuses to wear a blue ribbon while Beatrix daftly looks on, openly scolding her creations that accept Norman and his pledge of love with the same twinkling nonchalance of their creator.  Adding to the charm is Zellweger's natural exuberance and delightful surprise at Mr. Warne's attentions.  The dance scene between them and Beatrix's wonderfully imaginative depiction of Norman and his sister as they leave the Potter townhouse exemplifies the film's ability to enchant.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the remaining thirty minutes of the movie move in a completely different direction.  The whimsy still exists, however the whole conclusion seem a little hurried to me; Beatrix and Co. abandon London and take up a long desired residence in the Lake District.  In too many picture perfect scenes, we watch her take idyllic walks amongst vistas so green they appear almost photographed through a warming filter. Understandably, the story must wind down and we must see Potter as history records her, however, I think more could have been made of her single-mindedness with regard to her property acquisition and the manner in which she decided to end out her days.  The abrupt ending of the fairytale aspect of this biopic disappoints; I wanted more characters coming to life and mingling with the ordinary humans.<br /><br />Bottom line?  In the tradition of \\"Becoming Jane,\\" \\"Miss Potter\\" takes the usual cinematic liberties in relating the bittersweet story of yet another British author's rise to fame and fortune.  With warmth and whimsy, director Chris Noonan does this tale of Peter Rabbit's creator justice, interjecting the sweet with the sad along with some memorable performances by Emily Watson as Norman's sister, Millie, and Barbara Flynn and Bill Paterson as Beatrix's formidable parents.

B00003CXPD|5.0|I had the rare treat of seeing the reincarnation of the movie \\"Billy Elliot\\" as a musical in the falls of 2005 and 2006 in London's West End where it is a huge hit. On January 10, 2009, I saw the musical for the third time--this time in Manhattan where it was every bit as good as in London. For me it is one of the best works of the last decade. With a variety of musical styles by Elton John the stage show is a masterful production finally to be produced in the U.S. in the fall of 2008. The movie itself is a skillfully crafted work, highly original, affecting, and perfectly cast.<br />In Billy's small mining town in northern England in the anti-labor Thatcher era, the miners are on strike. There's a heavy, oppressive police presence. The police are as much symbolic and iconic as they are real, and act as a mute chorus to the action throughout the movie. In one scene Billy is walking with a girl, and as they stroll she lightly taps the successive shields held by a line of silent, unmoving cops; the police are robotic, mechanistic, inhuman but menacing presences.<br />Billy has the audacity to prefer ballet classes to the manly boxing classes his striking father is paying fifty p for him to attend. Jamie Bell as eleven year-old Billy is a superb dancer, who is given masculine, very original pieces to interpret. His acting is equally brilliant. The dance teacher played to the hilt by Julie Walters is a tour de force performance. There's sentimentality, but it's humanity that triumphs here.<br />This is a brilliant, highly innovative, pioneering film.  The ending with adult dancer Adam Cooper is truly memorable, a heart stopper for those familiar with Matthew Bourne's great work for male dancers.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not bad, but it doesn't live up to its brand.  The plot line is a bit out there and is certainly more reminiscent of Lucas's films than Spielberg's.  Several of Indiana Jones's trademark lines and behaviors are preserved, but the intensity of the film's action is much less than previous films.    The plot line is more \\"out there\\" than the previous three films.  There are several elements, such as gold being magnetic, that really pulled me out of the film and lessened the believability of the whole story.  Perhaps, the biggest inadequacy in the film is that the importance of the Crystal Skull is insufficiently explained.    Harrison Ford does a commendable job reprising the role of an older Jones.  Shia LaBeouf does a fair job, but this is far from his best performance.    I would not hesitate to recommend Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but it is not in the same league as the first three.
B000000OAL|3.0|Certainly not as polished as we would later come to expect from Queen albums, this is a fairly solid debut. Obviously, Freddie had a strong voice from the start, and that unmistakable tone of Brian May's guitar is certainly in evidence. The main draw here is, of course, \\"Keep Yourself Alive.\\" There are other good early songs here as well, such as \\"Doing Alright,\\" \\"Liar,\\" and \\"Great King Rat.\\" Their material and execution would certainly get stronger and continue to evolve, but this is certainly not a bad first album by any means. It's just a little rougher around the edges than later releases.
0316067601|4.0|I don't read \\"war stories\\". I am after all a woman - who doesn't live in the military world, or with family and friends who are serving.  My idea of a war story is [[ASIN:1594481776 The Kite Runner (Riverhead Essential Editions)]] or [[ASIN:0802143415 Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of How the Wildest Man in Congress and a Rogue CIA Agent Changed the History of Our Times]]. The stories of the machinations and impact around the war, not of those fighting it in the trenches. On top of that in political circles, my die-hard republican acquantances call me \\"flaming liberal\\", my die-hard liberal acquaintances call me \\"ultra-conservative\\" (I think that makes me moderate).<br /><br />And still --- And still, I feel this is a story that will appeal to everyone - if they read it through. Yes, as others point out Marcus is an over-the-top, unabashed patriot with hyperbole equally promoting patriotism, the SEALs superiority and vilifying the humanitarian constraints placed on them and that damned liberal media. This level of \\"greatest, best, worst, and most evil\\" would make even Trump, the master of hyperbole, blush. (And for the first half of the book - will undoubtedly annoy dedicated liberals - and have ultra-conservatives yell ooh-raa! (sp?)<br /><br />But... But, this is authentically who this man is. What after all would you expect from a SEAL? What more could you want from a SEAL sent to do things none of the rest of us would want to do (or for some, at least would refuse to do).<br /><br />And underneath all of that hyperbole - is really a psychological story of a man whose identity is patriotism, discipline and obeying his leader and is now burdened with unimaginable guilt of choices.  Whether he's a hero or not - is best left to each reader. But, this is a riveting story of survival, heart breaking circumstances, ingenuity, dedication and the pain and disillusionment even the most dedicated military folks that serve us can face.<br /><br />I challenge every other woman and \\"non-war story\\" person to read it - and look beyond the war story - to the true story that lies beneath, and not be touched or at least experience a new perspective. Along the way, you won't be dissappointed by what a fast-paced thriller this ultimately becomes - or what you learn about the true trenches of Afghanistan.story\\" person to read it - and look beyond the war story - to the true story that lies beneath, and not be touched or at least experience a new perspective.

B00030DEQE|5.0|I recently upgraded my multi-computer, multi-platform system from 10/100 to 10/100/1000 and needed new ethernet card for all of my computers. I found on Amazon the Intel PWLA8391GT PRO/1000 GT PCI Network Adapter. I was happy because I know intel products usually work out-of-the-box for any os system.  When I got the product I found not only the ethernet cards but driver cds in addition. I slipped each card into my computers and as I thought no problems.  No need for the provided cds either,  Windows Vista easily downloaded drivers and I was on the net in minutes.  Also my Linux boxes had no problems with drivers.  All machines where up an running without a hitch. Great product!

B000000OAA|5.0|I know I may be going out on a limb here, but for my money this is the single best studio album this band ever did. And yes, that includes \\"A Night at the Opera.\\" The production, the overall sound and cohesion, and of course the songs, all come together on this one. There are so many styles here it's truly mind-boggling, but somehow it works. The glam-rock opener \\"Brighton Rock\\" leads into the campy majesty of \\"Killer Queen.\\" \\"Now I'm Here\\" is another rocker and a concert favorite. \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" is fast and furious, so much so that it was a natural for Metallica to cover years later. \\"Flick of the Wrist\\" is an absolutely acidic kiss-off to a crooked former manager. \\"Bring Back That Leroy Brown\\" may make you feel you're sitting in a speakeasy on a Saturday night, while \\"Dear Friends\\" is a short and sweet tearjerker. Even Roger Taylor -- notorious for penning the weakest songs on Queen albums -- hits the mark with \\"Tenement Funster.\\" If you're looking for everything this band was capable of on a single disc, look no further. Highly recommended.
0312379293|4.0|This is a wonderful Archer fantasy - with great sweeps of plotting twists and turns.  Archer actually spent time in the prison to which his character Danny is sent - even keeping a diary as another of his leading characters does (See: [[ASIN:0330418599 A Prison Diary]]). He spent time in the courts he described and lived much of the accomplishments of both the protagonists and antagonists of the book. This gives the book a wonderful underlying core of reality - even when the delightful plot line stretches to the incredible.<br /><br />With a cast of characters you can't help but root for and against, great court scenes, banter and insights into the british court system and ever-so-secretive world of Swiss bankers - it's just plain a great read I didn't want to put down.<br /><br />I would have given it 5-stars, but then it still didn't live up to my favorite of his [[ASIN:0061092037 The Fourth Estate]].  Also, new readers of Archer should be forewarned - he does like detail.  But the details are important to his stories - and told in a capturing way.

B000000OE7|3.0|As one reviewer noted, this CD seems to be getting the \\"sympathy vote\\" from many Queen fanatics. While it is not up to the standards of Mercury's final recordings with Queen on \\"Innuendo,\\" this posthumous release does have its moments. \\"It's a Beautiful Day\\" is a lovely opener -- very simple and life-affirming. \\"Let Me Live\\" and \\"Mother Love\\" are both strong. \\"A Winter's Tale\\" is another gem, with Freddie's voice adding layers of emotion to a fairly simple lyric. What drags this down a bit is the heavy use of synths, and the re-recording of previously released material. Also, there are no out-and-out rockers here, no attempts to explore different styles (a hallmark of the band). Had Freddie stayed around a while longer, this most certainly have been a stronger, more focused album. Not bad certainly, but it definitely feels half-finished. I would recommend it only for the true Queen fanatic.

Been around the country just to see those beautiful blue eyes in person.  Can someone, ANYONE explain to me what the h*ll is going on with this cd?!  Did someone else record it and unlawfully attach her name?!  There are very few artists who venture backwards, namely the queen.  Way back when she was dubbed \\"Minnie Mouse On Helium\\", but this is \\"Minnie Mouse On Crack\\".  Liked  \\"Four Minutes\\" and the last 2 tracks FINALLY shows signs of something resembling her normally high level of writing/production.  Even the artistic production value of this cd, including the cheesy booklet inside was far from her usual high standards.  Was this an intentional slam to Warner?  Is she having a pre-50 midlife crisis?  Is she drinking some of that ocean water commuting back & forth?  WHAT IS GOING ON?!!!!

B00005JPNZ|4.0|Well it's not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Last Crusade, but Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull is still better then The Temple of Doom and will stand proud with its predecessors as a solid action flick living up to an American icon. This long awaited final chapter to the story of treasure hunter Harry \\"Indiana\\" Jones Jr. may not live up to the greatness which were the first and third entries, but don't let a simple comparison ruin the fun of this fourth movie; on its own merits it still stands well enough on its own two feet, even if it isn't a masterpiece.<br /><br />The film starts off with a convoy of troops driving down a large road in Nevada while a gang of kids trail behind. The convoy pulls into a military base which is closed for a military test, but little do the guards know that these are actually Soviet KGB agents come to steal the treasures of some old military warehouse, the same one we saw the Ark go into at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Gone are the Nazis and biblical artifacts, here come the Russians and the cold war. One of the things I found very entertaining about this film was the harkening back to the 50's, the cold war red scares, the double agents, the talks of aliens and such, very much like the old films from that time. It really brings to light that this is a different time period then the previous films, this is the beginning of the cold war, and darn it we're going to have some cold war fun. From jet engines, to demonstrators marching down the street with signs saying \\"better dead then red,\\" this movie really pokes fun at all the scares and worries of that time period.

Fortunately Ford doesn't have to do all the work in this film, he has some help from Mutt, a new character who ------------ oh, sorry about that, I forgot, you all don't like spoilers. Okay, fine.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure they wrote his part into the film not because it would make it more interesting (although it does) or that it would deepen the plot (but it still does), I have the sneaky suspicion that he was put in to take the strain off of Fords back. Well no problem because Shia LaBeouf can pull off the action hero pretty well. I've never liked him very much, but here his performance was right on Q, giving us a LOT of comic relief and a healthy dose of action. Oh yeah, the action; well its solid. Three words for you buddy, REALLY BIG ANTS!!! Remember the scene in Raiders where that Nazi got chopped up in the airplane blades? Well this scene is a combination of that and that one scene in the first Mummy movie where the guy got eaten by bugs, only it's a Soviet getting killed and their in the Amazon, not Egypt. From Ford jumping back and forth on moving cars, to LaBeouf showing off his best Tarzan impersonation, the action leaves little to be desired.<br /><br />So how about negatives? Well, as I said, it's strange, maybe a little too strange for its own good. Why not stick to what we know? I hear Lucas wanted to do something even stranger then this but Spielberg and Ford had to talked him out of it, and at this point I'm really glad they did because there is no telling what he would have done had no one gad been there to knock some sense into him.

0143143492|2.0|People do become spiritually liberated. I have met such people as best I can tell and encountered charlatans, too. There are many, also, who achieve some relief from suffering by encapsulating that suffering in a well-defended belief system. It is my impression that such is the case with Mr. Tolle. Tolle's flat emotional delivery of the audiobook further suggests that he has encapsulated rather than resolved his inner struggles (this is known as \\"spiritual bypass\\"). In contrast, the liberated and advanced people I encountered were not afraid to have a personality but came across as lively and vibrant.     When I started listening, I was at first pleased that someone was explaining the distortions of ego in simple language. But I found myself with the growing impression that Tolle demonizes the ego and the thinking mind and thus creates a false enemy within. I don't want to demonize him, however. He offers many useful insights. Chief among them, he suggests many ways to recognize the illusion of identifying with one's thoughts and feelings and thus not being fully present. But there are important errors in this book, and its stance overall seems distorted. I came across several statements he made authoritatively that are untrue. Here are two of them.     The most important error is Tolle's statement that one cannot prepare for awakening, which can only be realized as an act of Grace. Yes, sometimes awakening seems to emerge from Grace. But such a statement unnecessarily quashes hope. Consider Jesus' admonition to \\"knock, and the door shall be opened.\\" Also, consider the detailed instructions in meditative traditions about how to build concentration and insight (in Buddhism, shamata and vipasyana), as well as what issues to contemplate to realize the immanent divinity in all of us (see the Tibetan Buddhist Lojong or mind-training slogans).     Although much of Tolle's book comes from the Buddhist tradition, he gets his history wrong. He sees the Buddha as the first toachieve full awakening 2600 years ago. However, Buddhism was a response to the ancient wisdom teachings of India that go back at least 7000 years. A review of those ancient teachings (which are called Sanatana Dharma) reveals that its seers were obviously liberated in a similar way to the Buddha. That is the historical and archeological record, but one can't thus conclude that people didn't fully awaken before that time.     Tolle's and other New Age teachings typically lack the depth and safeguards of mature spiritual traditions that have an extensive scriptural basis, well-developed practices, and which all require a qualified teacher to help the aspirant achieve that which cannot be captured in words. If Tolle relied on such a teacher and tradition, he would not make such errors.     I am told that the Catholic tradition embodies such teaching in the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius Loyola. These require an experienced confessor. Tibetan Buddhism is beautifully explained by many. A good place to start is the two-CD set by H. H. Dalai Lama 14th, Tenzin Gyatso, on The Four Noble Truths. You will find there a subtlety of understanding and an admonition that moksha or liberation is developed through long, patient, and determined practice. Meditation with the help of an advanced teacher, a qualified lama, is essential in that tradition -- and I can tell you from experience this is effective beyond what one could imagine. In the Kundalini Yoga tradition, Layayoga by Goswami is a definitive source book for readers with the patience for a detailed explanation by someone who obviously knew what he was writing about. Here, too, one gets an outline of what may be required, extracted from 280 scriptural sources. But there's no replacement for an adept yogi who is connected with a living, oral lineage guiding one's practices. If you are fortunate enough to find such a teacher, you are carefully assessed before being guided in practice. Then the results are dramatic and unmistakable, and one finds oneself not at the peak, but at the foot of the mountain of the spiritual journey.     If you are interested in Tolle's book, then you are already spiritually curious. You can set foot on the path of return. To do so, find a tradition that speaks truth to you, that produces spiritually advanced people who are kind, have integrity, are not on some power trip, that don't require all of your money or claim that no other tradition can lead you home. Find a tradition that does not make you discard your own sense of truth to adopt its beliefs. Spiritual truth holds up to the test of lived experience. Work directly with an advanced practitioner after you have carefully examined and tested whether you can deeply trust them. Anyway, you must ultimately walk your own path with the teacher's help. Find a tradition that points out the opportunities for realization in everyday life, and that has a well-developed scriptural base. The scriptures are a safeguard against the kinds of errors found in Tolle's book. Lived experience and scientific findings are safeguards against culturally-bound dogma. Scriptures of spiritual depth also contain profound meaning that can only be hinted at in words and may only be realized through lived experience. The teacher's role is to safely guide you in having such experiences yourself.
0321525655|5.0|Having grown up in Japanese culture, I find it very interesting to view the subject matter from a cultural or spiritual framework such as zen.     I'm also impressed by how well Garr Reynolds treated hard topics like wabi, sabi and shibumi.    A must-read for anyone trying to improve communication skills!
B000YRY8BG|5.0|I got this DVD on a Satuday evening and thought I'd watch the first of the six episodes. Four hours later, I had to stop because I was sleepy but the next morning I immediately finished off the last two hours. This is a great mini series and I highly recommend it. The interplay between the press and the politicians seems realistic and the plot is pleasantly complicated. Don't count on doing something else while watching this -- it will take your full attention to follow the twists and turns of this brilliant movie. Bill Nighy, as the newspaper editor, steals every scene he's in and you'll also get a look at James McAvoy before he got more well-known for his performance in \\"Atonement\\". If you've seen the new version of this with Russell Crowe and Ben Affleck -- this one is more complex and interesting.

B000I0QM0E|2.0|First off this is a review of the product, not the film. The movie is one of me favorites. With that said here is why I gave the BD a bad rating. I have seen the original release of this Blu-Ray back before Paramount switched sides and if this is just a reissue of that product now that they have to make Blu-Rays again I would recommend getting the DVD. The HD film transfer was terrible. It was the same on the HD-DVD. The only upside to the HD-DVD version is that it at least had a form of HD audio (Dolby Digital Plus - which sounds way better than the original mix). The BD did not and I suspect this one will not either. You are better off getting the DVD and upconverting from that. I have Both HD-DVD and DVD versions (rented the original BD). Film quality on the upconverted DVD is exactly the same as both HD-DVD and Blu-Ray versions. The only thing different (and reason I own the HD) on the HD-DVD version is HD sound. The Blu-Ray has the same sound mix that was available on the DVD. High disappointment for BD owners. Blu-Ray doesn't require HD sound unfortunately - the same thing happened on Michael Clayton (TrueHD on HD-DVD and nothing for BD). If you have a HD-DVD player and you want the HD sound (you must have a HD receiver to get this benefit) I recommend that version otherwise save your money for a different BD release that deserves you patronage. If this is a cleaned up version feel free to let me know, but since there is nothing that says \\"Remastered,\\" as The Fifth Element had, I will assume you haven't seen Pirates of the Caribbean, Cars, Casino Royal, National Treasure or the many other stellar BD releases or you just need to get your eyes checked if you give this Blu-Ray a great review. Hope this helps with your shopping.<br /><br />Edit-Turns out this is just a reissue of the same BD that was originally released back when Blu-Ray launched. No improvements what so ever. Bad HD transfer and no HD sound. If the HD-DVD didn't have Dolby Digital Plus I would have never gotten it on HD-DVD and the lack of an HD sound format on the Blu-Ray makes purchasing this item absolutely pointless, since the DVD upconverted looks exactly the same as the HD transfer.<br /><br />Great movie. Bad product.gotten it on HD-DVD and the lack of an HD sound format on the Blu-Ray makes purchasing this item absolutely pointless, since the DVD upconverted looks exactly the same as the HD transfer.

B000ZN802W|1.0|Although I was not familiar with the story, I was REALLY wanting to see this movie.  However, the story never lived up to my anticipation.  Try as it does to present meaning to the tragic upper middle class American society that Sean Penn loves to hate, the movie comes off as an attempt to portray a spoiled, self-centered \\"victim\\" as a liberating messiah.  In the film everything he touches is turned to gold.  But yet, he remains a unfulfilled, self-absorbed uber-brat.  Yeah, we all hate our parents at time throughout our lives, I get it.  But to this extent?      The message of the movie is simply this:  focus all attention of your life on your own fulfillment (or lack of).  In the end, this will somehow give you a satisfying, albeit, unplanned death.  But the soundtrack was good. Save your money on this one.  Better yet, try to find Farley Mowat's Never Cry Wolf.

B000XA5K48|5.0|Almost every low review written about \\"Shoot 'Em UP\\" is from a person who COMPLETELY missed the point. Anyone who watches this movie needs to understand that this movie is a \\"S A T I R E\\" !!!!!!*    This is one of the funniest satires I have ever seen. Hands down.    \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" does not have in depth characters, it IS SUPPOSED TO BE misogynistic, and if you try to take it seriously for one second..... you're going to hate it. Watch this film when you need a good laugh. The dialog is hysterical. Every scene from start to finish is completely \\"Over the Top\\", but still executed with big budget precision. The acting is absolutely dead on perfect. I think it was marketed very badly, and THAT'S why it did poorly at the box office.    Watch this movie when you need a good laugh, you won't regret it.      *(With appreciation to T. Lamar Terrell for correcting my original mis-classification of this film as a spoof)
0439813786|5.0|Brian Selznick has a great imagination!  It's cool how Hugo fixes wind-up toys and clockworks.  It is exciting when Hugo rescues the mechanical man and fixes his parts with parts from wind-up toys that he stole from the toy booth in the train station.  It's cool how Hugo has his own secret hiding place to live in the train station.  Another character that I like is Etienne because he can do a magic trick of taking a ball out of his eye socket, where his eye had been.  His eye is covered by an eye patch.  It's amazing to see the picture that the mechanical man draws.  I also like how Brian Selznick uses half pictures and half words.  It's really creative.  Some of the pictures look like photographs and some are really good drawings.  I recommend this book to anybody who has a good imagination.
0618680004|5.0|Some may criticize Dawkins for his acid sense of humor and almost religious zeal. The book is a very easy read and the author's ideas are very well organized and logical. Most criticism against religion is done with basis on literature and facts. Some reviewers criticize the author for not being a theologist but I don't think that this would make a big difference since what Dawkins discuss is really philosophy (he does have a PhD). I particularly like the chapter on the consequences of religions on children and the fact that he uses scientific data to support his hypotheses. Not that one or two experiments define the truth, but any well designed experiment will be a better evidence than a thousand words. How many experiments do religious people have in support of what they say?     This is not a book to convince pious people to become atheist (which may not be a feasible task). Nevertheless this is a great read for people with an open mind about religions and atheism or for atheists. If you liked the other books by the same author I am sure you will like this one. If you already have a set opinion on the topic and a closed mind about it, just don't bother expending the money.
0739366408|5.0|This is what I'd call a seminal work of Zombie literature but it is far more than that. It is a wonderful book - period. Why? Well, it takes an old premise (Zombies trying to wipe out humans) and puts a whole new spin on it.<br /><br />I'm not even a huge fan of the horror genre but that makes no difference. When a writer creates a book that actually has readers being able to  believe that Zombies could take over the world, overthrow governments, etc....well, that writer has a special talent. Brooks is that writer and World War Z is a \\"must read\\" because of that.<br /><br />If you need ONE reason to read this, here it is: you'll be forced to think about the strengths and weaknesses of humanity, even more than you may already have done.<br /><br />The plot? Well, it is no secret that this book is told by survivors of a Zombie attack but HOW they get to that point - and what they go through along the way, including personal challenges and adversity, serve as both inspiration and caution for readers.<br /><br />Another point worth making: the author ties this into history, past and present. I have a soft spot for books that do that well, help us imagine how we can prevent potentially apocalyptic events from happening. This book could actually do that, could be that life-changing for some people. I hope it is.<br /><br />So, yeah, on the surface it may seem to be a book about people trying to avoid being killed by Zombies. But below the story, are other, darker themes. What are people capable of doing when truly tested? What flaws come out? Can we come together and fight evil or unforeseen emergencies?<br /><br />In case all of the above sounds all too SERIOUS for some readers, let me also make a case for some of the other details in this book. Ever wonder about the lifestyle of Zombies, those of you who've seen enough B movies to get a sense of Zombie stereotypes and habits? Well, this book delves into those questions, too. You'll actually be engaged by these details.<br /><br />So, to sum it up: A book which focuses on Zombies trying to wipe out humans. A book which may compel readers to think about their own humanity and potential for courage in the face of adversity. A book which also educates readers about history, past, present and future (although some of that education is left up to the interpretation of the reader).<br /><br />If that isn't enough to get you to read Word War Z, then get the audiotape version. [[ASIN:0307346617 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]] With people like Alan Alda and other major stars reading from the book,it might be a good alternative. I've got both versions and am buying another copy of each. Literature like this deserves to be shared!n Zombies trying to wipe out humans.

B000VAQX0A|5.0|Ultra Magnus obviously knows nothing about Mobile Fidelity or fine recordings in general. The sound is superb and Rush definitely got their cut from the licensing process that MoFi goes through. What an ignoramus!!
B0014I4KIK|4.0|While I like the CD as a whole, I was a little disappointed.  Her PR made its sound like the CD would be more Mercy and Warwick Avenue-type songs.  Most of the tracks have a rather spartan feel to them (maybe that was the producer's intentions?), but Duffy's voice carries the songs through.
B000002KDX|5.0|I got the vinyl of this one years ago and never thought as time went on that this one would stand the test of time but it did! When \\"Horse With No Name\\" came out I really thought it was another Neil Young follow-up to \\"Heart Of Gold\\". Well, they had a few singles off this album, another being \\"I Need You\\" and had a gold album. The CD is great even today and highly recommend it as well as seeing them \\"Live\\" which I did a few years back. visit my website \\"Judemac Forever\\" google it and say \\"Hi\\". One other side note, the songs pulled off this one for the America Greatest Hits collection in the 1970's were remixed by George Martin of Beatles fame.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|This movie is one of the funniest movies I ever seen. With my personality, You probably wouldn't expect me to like this movie(If you no me). This is a classic I would not mind watching over and over again. I just finish catching it on TV. It was in the middle of the movie, I was bummed! LOL  So I decided to come here and see if I could find it. While it was on my mind.    I'm a 32 year old woman with tons of hobbies and work in my life. When I want to watch a classic funny movie, this is the one to watch!!!
B00000DGRX|5.0|I always thought the original album was far too short on vinyl. I even have the quad version of the album but this expanded version is the ticket. Don't waste your time getting the original version and get this one, you won't be sorry. Anyway, most reviewers have already said pretty much what I would have said so what are you waiting for? If you like this one, get the rest of their catalog. Also stop by my small website, google \\"judemac Forever\\" and say hello.
B000GFLKF8|3.0|The 3-star reviews have it right for me.  Short summary: fascinating bank heist with some unusual and very clever twists, Denzel is terrific, Jodie Foster's role is unnecessary, Christopher Plummer is oddly one-dimensional, Willem Dafoe is strong but in a small role, a couple of the bonus deleted scenes shouldn't have been deleted, and the plot holes are indeed several and large.  Suggest renting rather than purchase; it is good to watch once if you're a Denzel fan as I am, but know that you will most likely not repeat the experience.

0739316478|4.0|I bought this unabridged version of the CD read by Michael Beck for a long car trip, and wasn't disappointed.  I really enjoyed Michael Beck as a reader.  I've listened to many books on tape, and I've actually gone looking for other books he's read because he does it so well.  (I've listened to other readers, and there's definitely a skill involved there.)    First, if you're looking for the courtroom drama/action, you won't find it here.  I do feel I could figure out how to change my identity <g> and that part was really interesting an entertaining.  Second, I would suggest that maybe the abridged version would have been a bit easier to handle.  All the learning of the Italian, exercise drills, etc, while probably natural  when actually reading a book, just really slowed the whole process down in audio.  I kept wanting to get on with the story since I'm listening to it to take my mind off tedious travel, and instead I'm getting tedious Italian lessons.     Grisham has a writing style that's enjoyable, but I was hoping for something really suspenseful.  The beginning was great, the middle slow and the end felt a little too convenient.  Not as good as his other books, but he took me to someplace other than boring highway, so 4 stars from me.
B000VSBX34|5.0|I loved the Beatles movies since it was the days before TV videos.  Growing up as a Beatles fan back in the 60's my friends and I would sit at the movie theater all day and still would not get enough of The Fab 4.  This movie is abit corny by todays standards but if you love The Beatles and thier music you love this one.  The scenery as they travel around the world when filming is great.
B000001ELP|5.0|This is the KISS album I cannot live without. I use it for inspirational/ motivational music to get my day started. \\"I\\" jumps. The whole album has kind of a medieval feel- reminds me of knights and chivalry. With so much music available from other artists that makes the listener feel angry or encourages values that degrade women, this album is the counterpoint. The lyrics foster hope and a sense that we all have a purpose and a duty to each other and ourselves to be the best we can be.<br />The songs are strange and somewhat dis-jointed. There may have been plans for the songs to follow a storyline, but it never really materialized. Don't get me wrong... the songs are complete. It is just not the normal fare we get from KISS, where love-making or love-lost is often the point.<br />Just so you know... I have loved KISS from the mid- seventies, owned all of the albums at one time or another, been present at fourteen concerts. If I have a favorite band, KISS is the one.<br />Favorite tracks in no particular order: I, Under the Rose, The Oath, A World without Heroes, Dark Light, Only You.<br />I wish the album had been a bigger success, but history rates it a dud. Just goes to show that bands get paralyzed into a genre that the fans will not let them leave. It's too bad, too, because I think this album shows more of the personality of the artists than any other album.

1416914293|5.0|I was very surprised by the amount of one, two or even three star reviews for this book because I actually enjoyed it. It wasn't as exciting as the first book in the series: City of Bones but it was still enjoyable enough to be given five stars.<br /><br />On Clary's next adventure there is even more conflicts going on in her life: She is still falling for Jace, who she believes to be her brother and Simon, her best friend is falling for her.

B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I have to admit I was intrigued when I found out Donna was coming out with a new album.  I've always liked her as a recording artist.  She was the backbone of Disco, which was my era - I enjoyed her music through all her major albums for Casablanca [75-80].  It was always Donna, Giorgio Moroder, Pete Belotte and Harold Faltermeyer that were coming up with the freshest grooves and beats, and crossing genres as well.<br /><br />I loved her work during the Geffen years, where she seemed to pull away from the usual formula of her recordings.  Ditto for her two albums for Atlantic; \\"Another Place And Time\\" and \\"Mistaken Identity\\".  She was never scared to explore new musical horizons whether the albums were considered successes or not, which I admired.  Anyone can do what their label tells them and put out the same crap and shite over and over again.<br /><br />But you could always tell that Donna followed the beat of her own drummer.  I think in her heart, she wanted every album to be a success, but Donna was never one to rest on her laurels and wandered around so many different styles - each new album was refreshing.  [Case in point - 1981's \\"I'm A Rainbow\\" that Geffen Records refused to release, 1982's Quincy Jones produced \\"Donna Summer\\" and 1987's All Systems Go produced by Harold Faltermeyer].  I remember hearing \\"This Time I Know It's For Real\\" for the first time and thinking Wow, Donna's back in the house!<br /><br />This time around, she was signed by Burgandy - which is a Sony imprint and who also recently signed Ms. Chaka after she left Warner Bros., and did an album for Princes NPG records [as well as a couple of indies].<br /><br />The sound and tone of the album leans very heavy on bass.  A lot of the highs are mixed down and not very bright.  Another thing is the drums tracks are mixed way down.  You FEEL the beat rather than hear the beat.  As a fan of big, chunky beefy drums, this was a bit awkward at first for me.<br /><br />But then there are THE SONGS:<br /><br />The songs are EXCELLENT!  The first single 'Stamp Your Feet' sounds like typical radio play - it's fresh and should do well for her.  The other song that caught my attention was 'I'm A Fire' - which will burn down the clubs.  I listened to this cut while driving on the freeway and thought, once again, - wow - Donna's in the house again!  I can see this song becoming a very strong club staple.<br /><br />The songs that resonated the most for me outside of I'm A Fire are \\"Sand On My Feet\\", \\"Driving Down Brazil\\", \\"Slide Over Backwards\\" where she sings in this incredibly raw 'backwoods, old New Orleans' type of voice which sounds just great.  Also loved \\"Science Of Love\\".  \\"Be Myself Again\\" is a very touching and sensitively performed song.  You can tell by listening it is very heartfelt.  \\"The Queen Is Back\\" is a funny tune and she's having fun poking fun at herself which was great and provided me with a chuckle while driving and listening to it.  I recall listening to one of the songs while driving and she asks 'do you feel it'?  And I replied, out loud - yes Ma'am, I most certainly do.<br /><br />Not only did she have a hand in composing almost all of the tunes on the album, but her voice is in GREAT shape.  I've read a few reviews here that mentioned her vocals are processed a bit too much.  Donna doesn't need vocal processing at all, but it is a fact of the times - on most ALL commerical records - the vocals use extensive processing.  It is a production style that is very popular.  Some need it - some don't - but most use it anyway.  The processing, be that with digital reverb, digital delay, and/or vocoders - I can say that her vocals are processed a LOT LESS than other artist's commercial recordings of late, and she doesn't use any pitch perfectors either - she doesn't need em folks.<br /><br />She, in a word, SOUNDS GREAT.  I would have to say that the production style of the record took me a bit of time to get used to, but people need to know thatthis is a GREAT album and to give it a shot!  Definitely worth the wait.<br /><br />It's great to have you back Ms. Summer - I hope Crayons opens up many avenues of options for you to explore on your next record.  Please don't make us wait this long for the next one though...<br /><br />PEACE-he wait.      It's great to have you back Ms. Summer - I hope Crayons opens up many avenues of options for you to explore on your next record.  Please don't make us wait this long for the next one though...

B0014VPFTA|1.0|First of all, I should mention that I don't actually have this album, but instead I went out and bought the original release the day that it came out. Now here's a re-release to include the song \\"Say\\".  So, I say, way to go to John Mayer, for being one of those artists who irritates fans by pulling stunts like this. Perhaps if it is released on another album with new material I would buy it. Anyway, about the rest of the album, it's okay, but I think \\"room for squares\\" and \\"heavier things\\" stayed in my cd player a lot longer than this one.
B0013527I4|5.0|The producers of DVDs really should show on the box whether the DVD is closed captioned for the hearing impaired, and whether it has captions in other languages.  The first Muppet DVD captioned dialogue but alas, not the songs.  The second and third are closed captioned.  This is incredibly important for the deaf and hearing impaired.  I erroneously posted here that the DVD was not captioned because there was no symbol of it on the box.  My son checked it out and indeed it is fully captioned!!  Perhaps Amazon would be so kind as to add CC somewhere in its listing of this product. As Fozzy Bear might say, \\"Zowie!\\"
B00005JPO1|5.0|We went to the midnight showing of CRYSTAL SKULL when it was released. Now, I am a fan from way back (I was 12 when the first one came out) and it's hard not to have huge expectations. My wife is from an entirely different generation and went in with no agenda at all. She loved it from start to finish while I couldn't fairly judge it because I was too busy waiting for it to go south. I slept on it and then we went back the next day and saw it again. Here's the deal... RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was a great film, nearly impossible to top. Interestingly enough, I thoroughly enjoyed the seond movie, TEMPLE OF DOOM, just as much (I was 15 and still full of imagination at that point.) By the time THE LAST CRUSADE rolled around, I was 20 years old and much less able to see things with child-like wonder. The third film wasn't as \\"magical\\" to me when I saw it in theaters. Recently, I rewatched all 3 and found that I loved them all- for very different reasons. RAIDERS will always be a great adventure film- lightning in a bottle. The other 2 are great adventures. The common thread is Indy- and if you love him, you love the films... all 4 of them. The second time I saw CRYSTAL SKULL, I didn't compare it to anything that came before. After all, it's an entirely different pop culture throwback- while the first 3 are take-offs on the movie serials of the 1930s and 1940s, the new one is a representation of the sci-fi B movies of the 1950s and, as such, it works perfectly. There are certainly a couple of moments where you shake your head (Lucas' tribute to TARZAN) but then you notice that the 8-year-olds in the audience are loving those parts. Harrison Ford turns in a virtuoso performance. He has refined Indy's character to reflect all the previous experiences we have witnessed. Indy has become like his own father in many ways (wise, experienced, confident and calm) and learned from his father's failings as well (when dealing with the younger Mutt, he is understanding, attentive and \\"cool.\\") Mutt's character is a welcome addition as is the return of Marion Ravenwood- Shia LaBoeuf and Karen Allen are both truly excellent. The supporting cast turn in solid performances as well. There are touches of humor and mystery throughout and the motorcycle chase and the grave-yard scene are on par with any of the action sequences from the first 3 films. All-in-all it was great to see old friends again and, for a little over 2 hours, to be 12-years-old again!
B00011KHTM|2.0|I use this cable to connect my Macbook to a 22\\" Viewsonic LCD as a desktop replacement.  It has been shorting every other day since i bought it.  So every other AM I fiddle with it for about 15 minutes to get it signal the proper resolution to the monitor.  Shame on me for putting up with it, but from what I read it's a common quality control problem with this cable - so shame on Apple.  If the cable cost more than $20 you would see more bad reviews, but at $19 I figure people just suck it up and buy another one.
1400063515|2.0|Taleb is an almost unbearalbe mix of arrogant and lazy.  His ideas could be boiled down to about 10 pages, but he insists on rambling anecdotes to make his point.  For someone claiming to rise above the rest of humanity with his visionary approach to history, his use of anecdotes as evidence is comical.  Less comical but more serious is his wholesale invention of fictional anecdotes to support his theories.  I want a refund.
B0018QCXGY|4.0|If you are a gamer you probably have played a FPS (first person shooter) where all you see is what your character sees, and that is how cloverfield is shot,through the eyes of these people running away from the monster, it is a great thrill to see it through their eyes and i hope more movies are shot like this in the future. The only problem i had with it though were the first 20 minutes, too much talking.      I recomend this movie
B000V6I7WG|5.0|Oldboy is an extremely bizarre, fast-paced thriller that will leave you asking questions till the very end.  Some may be offended by its over-the-top violence but they can't really appreciate the film for what it is: a masterpiece.  Everything about this movie is exceptionally well done, and it is now being picked up by Spielberg who is remaking it with Will Smith to star.  If you don't like reading subtitles you can still enjoy this movie, because the english dub is one of the best I have ever heard.  This movie is a must see for anyone wanting to see a highly original film, and aren't offended easily by movies with a hard-R rating.<br /><br />Laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone
0783231032|3.0|this movie was okay, it get funny twoards the end of the movie, but it does have good actors in it.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|I have enjoyed this album a lot.  A new favorite for me!
B000N3AWDE|2.0|I'm not carzy about this CD. I have some previous Dion CDs in french, and they are all great, but ths one... not. She shouts too much, the music composition lacks of talent. Dommage
B00005JPLW|1.0|In this cross between a Harlequin romance novel and Mein Kampf, desperate  overactors dress up in leather thongs to shed the blood of nonwhites in slow motion - all for the sake of \\"liberty\\".      The Spartan queen actually says \\"freedom isn't free\\".  And then she has some apple pie.  (OK, I made that last part up - but it wouldn't have been out of place).     If you like homoerotic schmalz, pretentious narration and unfettered  sentimentalism, this is the movie for you!
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Madonna...  Always surprising with something new. This is a very nice cd, although I prefer it's predecesor. I specially like the third song. I'm not carzy for her pics, the light is too harsh on her and she's not 20, 30 or 40 anymore... although she looks great for her age. With a better lighting whe'd look much better.
B0014KD46W|5.0|I have been a fan of Steve Winwood since the 60's when I followed his career with The Spencer Davis Group, Traffic and Blind Faith.  The changes reflect his creativity, his musicianship, his artistry.    This CD is incredible.  There are elements of jazz, blues, and a little pop. I enjoy every song, and each one is a positive experience.  The lyrics are thought provoking, and the music is soothing and moving.  I am glad that I have this recording in my collection.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|When I saw Diana Damrau performing the Queen of The Night, I was breathless!!! I first saw her through you-tube, so I decided to buy this dvd. It's a pitty that they decided to publich on hd dvd instead of  bluray...
B000YDOOUK|5.0|Airbourne is absolutely awesome.  Hard rock at its best.  Yes, there is the AC-DC influence but these guys rock.  Buy it you won't be disappointed.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|this  series is absolutely breathtaling, amazing. You have to see it. The wuality of the images is unsurpassed.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Watched this movie after my parents got it for me on video for the 60th anniversary edition. It has always been my favorite Disney movie and now I share it with my nieces. I was probably 3 when I first saw it so ignore those people who say kids won't like it I loved it. Probably shouldn't let kids see the last one til they're older though as it is rather scary. My nieces love the fairies and unicorns.
B00139XZF4|5.0|I loved this movie, the photography quality is amazing, I just hope there will be a sequel, I heard they didn't have much success in the US, only in Europe.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|An excellent film, The Good Shepherd, brings to the screen the events and people that brought about the establishment of the Central Intelligence Agency.    The film follows the life and career of Edward Wilson as he plays his role in laying the foundation for one of the best intelligence agencies ever to be set up.   Matt Damon, Robert De Niro, Alec Baldwin, Angelina Jolie, Michael Gambon, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!   The acting, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful and along with the mystery that accompanies this film will keep you on your toes throughout the entire 168 minutes.  In short, The Good Shepherd is a movie definitely worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|It's an amazing love story, when I knew it was out on blu-ray I just had to have it. I loved it, although there's not a big difference from the regular dvd. The movie is amazing.
0307265730|5.0|I have been a fan of Jhumpa Lahiri ever since I read her first book. This one, a collection of several short stories, is one of her best creations. Her detailed expressive style, fluid language and diverse topics make this book unputdownable. I recommend this book to everyone is looking for beautiful contemporary fiction.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Ths is absolutely the best James Bond movie ever made. Normally I don't like action movies, but this one is so good. I also think Daniel Craig is the best modern James Bond. What I also like about this movie is that htey don't relly so much on gadgets, but in physical force, witt.
B00152VWKO|4.0|I purchased my copy on sale, the original cost is $3.00 more than the normal non-eco friendly CD with the plastic case. I was dissapointed that it did not have the liner notes and it seems to be just a CD in box...no thrills. Looking back if this was not on sale for $3.00 cheaper than the normal non-eco friendly CD I would have been very disappointed.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|Wonderful singers. Specially Rolando Villazon you cry of joy after listening to his interpretation of Una Furtiva Lagrima, he had a standing ovation...
0446402389|5.0|Excellent story and insight into Stalin era Russia. One of the best reads I've ever experienced. Can't wait for his 2nd book.
B000UNYK76|4.0|I like this more every time I watch it. I only wish there were more songs on it. The music is great, the footage with band members talking and checking out Italy is great.
B000Z6MIQS|4.0|I still think their best work is the first album, but I do enjoy what they put out.  I've listened to the album multiple times and it gets better each time.  Can't wait for the next one.
0316067601|2.0|YES! THE EVIL LIBERAL MEDIA! The war is being mis-managed NOT by the commander in chief, his Nixon-era appointees or the military high command BUT BY THE LIBERAL MEDIA! according to this insipid instant cliche of a soldier's memoir. THE LIBERAL MEDIA IS TO BLAME FOR THE FAILURE OF HIS MISSION... not the mistakes he made that an illiterate third worlder would know better than to make.     This book is slightly improved when the narrative expands to describe his experiences with the local villagers of the high Afghan mountains, but never sufficiently to make up for the self serving moronic republican fox-news drivel that he has been brain-washed with (and proceeds to drown us in). He needed the professional writer to co-write this bragadocious monstrosity because his political statements betray that he is dumber than a box of rocks.    He may be a hero, but reading his story makes you equally as embarrassed for him as it makes you proud of him.
0800141849|5.0|Jeff Bridges and \\"Babs, Dahling!\\" combine efforts to spark an excellent look into modern romance from an academic perspective.  The two Columbia professors meet through a personal ad, written by a sexually jilted Bridges and answered by lonely Streisand's manipulative sister, after floundering through unsatisfactory relationships that left them both wanting more, much more.  How do you find and maintain a lasting substantive love in a world that is aflame with \\"silly romantic notions\\"? Great supporting performances are turned in by Lauren Bacall(Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), George Siegel, Lucy Avery, and Pierce Brosnan.  Marvin Hamlisch also walks away from the Oscars with Best Song.  Last, but far from least, it is always a delight to watch one of Bab's directed productions in which she also acts, admire her beauty accented by her remarkable nose :-), and also hear Barbra vocalize on the soundtrack.  Buy the DVD and, like me, watch it over and over and over again!
B000WTLDPU|5.0|Finally, a group of hollywood's elite make a truly wonderful movie!  Whether the delightfully evil Michelle Pfeiffer or shockingly effeminate Robert DeNiro, the characters are light, the storyline fun, with just enough twists to keep children and adults alike interested.  We watched it with 4 generations, and everyone loved it - most wanted to see it again!  Great stuff!
B000002GBD|1.0|My apologies to Rolling Stone Record Guide.  RSRG aptly termed this band's offerings as dog food, an obvious reference to the title of this album.  This is dreadful music.  The big hit from this album, \\"Love Hurts\\", is musically marginal at best, and that is the song's strong point.  Featuring trite lyrics (are we really supposed to take lyrics like \\"love is like a flame that burns you when it's hot\\" seriously?) and one of the worst vocal performances in rock history (possibly the worst until Axl Rose of Guns n' Roses started destroying such classics as Van Morrison's \\"Wild Nights\\") one would have to be pretty brave to want to look past this song into the rest of the album's offerings. If you want to listen to a GOOD song named \\"Love Hurts\\", listen to the Everly Brothers.  The rest of the album really does not get much better either.  The title track, which still gets occasional airplay, is marginally less offensive than \\"Love Hurts\\", and might have even made it as a hard rock classic if it had been performed better.  As bad as these two hits are, just imagine what the filler sounds like!  Lacking anything resembling the poetic vision of Doors or the strong songwriting and musicianship of Led Zeppelin, this album (and this band) should appeal to people who enjoy poor to mediocre things in life.  If you like hard rock and have any musical sensibility at all, look elsewhere.  Even bands like Foreigner and Triumph have these guys beat hands down.
B0013FBS20|2.0|Apparently high-dollar special effects and a heretofore unknown superhuman quality given to the infected humans is supposed to be enough to make a blockbuster.  I like Will Smith in almost anything, and while I applaud loudly the special effects, the story is lost most of the time, convoluted and disjointed all the time, and only slightly related to the original.  The modified story eliminates nearly every small ray of hope, substituting seemingly unending darkness and obscuring some of the best subtexts of the original.  Don't waste your time and money on this version; get \\"The Omega Man\\" with Charlton Heston instead.
B00139B39E|3.0|I am a long time Dream Theater fan who began to lose interest in the band with Six Degrees, since at that point it seemed like they were making long songs just to be long, and it was more about instrumental wizardry than songwriting.<br /><br />Recently, I have rarely been listening to the band - but I picked this up since I wanted to see how these songs stood up now, many years later.<br /><br />First, this set does contain almost all of their great songs (note, nothing from Systematic Chaos or When Dream and Day Unite - I assume rights/permissions issues , or from any of their many live albums).<br /><br />If you have heard much from the band, then this is a decent introduction. However, I don't like the separation of the 'dark' (heavier) and 'light' (the less heavy) - makes the 'light' side difficult to get through.<br /><br />Portnoy does hint that there should have been a third side - the epic side - and I agree. At they very least, they should have found space for their best epic - A Change of Seasons. other songs missing are Surrounded, 6:00, Space Dye Vest, Burning My Soul, among others. They could have found space, Disc 2 is about 50 minutes, so there was space left over for additional songs.<br /><br />So, in the end, a decent set, but mainly for new or 'lapsed' fans like me.

0425220931|5.0|Victor Wooten's superb showmanship has always impressed those fortunate enough to see him perform. His recordings entertain and inspire, and a conversation with him will give you new perspectives on unexpected subjects.  Now he's written a book that shares some of his unique insights on music and life. It's easy to read even if you are not a musician, and everyone can find something in it that speaks to them.
B00005KIVN|3.0|Tango Lesson  Is only for tangueros - it illustrates a one woman obsession  with the dance.  Hence it's quite limited and you must  be very interested in Tango/Milonga to get anything from it.
B00005JPNY|4.0|I can understand why many people were upset by this movie. I am a big fan of the His Dark Materials books. Yes, the movie moves through all the events of the book too quickly. Yes, the Svalbard and Bolvangar sequences were switched in favor of a battle sequence at Bolvangar ending the film, and the devastating and awe-inspiring climax of the book wasn't included. However, it was intended to be included and New Line cut the movie horribly, trying to create a fast-paced kid-friendly movie with an uplifting ending. The movie is, however, very well-and-lovingly made, and very well acted. The bonus materials on this two-disc set show the most honest and interesting behind-the-scenes materials I have ever seen, showing how closely Philip Pullman worked with the cast and crew on this film and how much thought and attention to detail went into every aspect of it to make a lovely interpretation of Pullman's universe. I highly recommend that fans of His Dark Materials give this film a second chance and watch this movie as a separate entity from the books, and I also firmly believe that any fan of the books who watches these bonus materials will find a whole new appreciation for this film.
B00127RAJY|4.0|[[ASIN:B00127RAJY Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred]]  this is one great DVD---some base ability is needed even to start the beginner level though!!!! yes, Jillian will make you work although the first and last 4 minutes are warmup/cooldown; so only 22 minutes, but all work!!!  Made it a 4 star because you can't skip through the intro or change from 1 level to next workout level easily.
0321544080|5.0|From its description, I expected a \\"how-to\\" book. It isn't. Rather, it is a book filled with truly excellent photographs with a bit of personal story for each, many of which are interesting, and just a couple of hints about capturing shots like those on the pages.<br /><br />  The truth is that most of us will never have the opportunity to get shots like these; at the top of a New York skyscraper, dangling from a helicopter 500 feet about the well-known Hollywood sign in Los Angeles, photographing prima ballerinas and telling them to take off their shoes.<br /><br />  One revealing tidbit of just how different Joe McNally is different from me (and probably you) is the contents of his camera bag. Well, actually bags: three of them. Three Nikon bodies, eleven Nikon lenses, five Nikon SB-800 speedlights - and a lot more. And, of course, a lot of the shots are lit with truly serious lighting, the kind of units that cost thousands of dollars or rent for hundreds of dollars a day. like Joe's Avenger 12 x 12 foot Butterfly Foldaway Frame.<br /><br />  So what do we have here?<br /><br />  A book of great photographs, some interesting stories on how they came to be and some hints and tips.<br /><br />  It is more than enough, frankly.<br /><br />  For example, Joe tells of an experience in Star City, the Russian space training facility. He gets on a zero-gravity training plane by bribing someone with $7,500, talks about retching 50 times as the plane dives to acheive zero Gs, gives a one sentence of how he made the shot on the facing page which, frankly, is breathtaking.<br /><br />  No, I will never be able to duplicate Joe's experience, but I am sure glad to that Joe McNally has shared some insights into his life with the rest of us.<br /><br />  All told, this is really more or less a coffee table photo book with a lot of personal stories. Great photography, great stories and more than a few useful tips.<br /><br />Jerry
0375842209|5.0|This is a wonderful novel that draws in the reader, and creates a brillant world around them. The main character is a little girl dealing with the horrors of World War II, where her parents are gone, and she is alone. She steals books, despite being unable to read. The story is a great look at World War II, and people's ways of dealing with the horrors where they were. It was also brillantly written from Death's point of view, which I found to be wonderfully done. Overall, I really enjoyed this novel, and found it be very interesting, and wonderfully written.     I highly recomend this book for anyone who loves to read!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is an outstanding portrayal of our nation's birth. You get a sense of what it must have been like during this period in history. It may be slow at times but deliberately so in my opinion; so the viewer can digest how these men and at least one woman (Abigail Adams) debated the issues -- going to war for freedom or staying true to the king.  And after the war, how this country was going to move forward and if it would move forward at all.     The dialog may be boring to some, but it gave me chills at times.  In France as Adams, Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin debate what kind of government they envision for their new country.  And Washington's inaugural, partly computer generated, yes, but nonetheless moving as Washington, speaking softly and barely audible, is shown as a bit shy about taking this new office; one of the many nuances that make these men come alive.

7119005901|5.0|I'll be perfectly honest: I've never been one to actually sit down and read a book unless it's been marked required reading. In fact, my only fantastic literary claim up to this point was conquering the Harry Potter series. Then, I picked up these volumes. I was absolutely enthralled.<br /><br />I picked up this book because I'm a big fan of the Dynasty Warriors series. In fact, I just recently discovered that the games themselves were based entirely off of this collection. From then on, I had a blast both playing through the games and reading the books, trying to pick out scenarios and information the game had changed (or in some instances, just completely left out). In the process, I learned something new about ancient Chinese culture and managed to have a fantastic time doing so.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. And as many others have said, do NOT buy the abridged version. Spend a little extra and get the four volume set. You'll get a lot more out of the reading.
B000ZPPS0W|2.0|The product consists of a book and two DVDs.  The book contains some interesting factual information and some great photos of the guys in the band.  The DVDs, however, leave a lot to be desired.  The greatest portion of the DVDs is devoted to interviews with unknown eccentric individuals only peripherally associated with Led Zeppelin.  The opinions of these people do not provide new information or insight about the band and the music.  The one exception is the guitar player from a Led Zeppelin cover band who sits down with an electric guitar and explains how Jimmy Page plays some of his riffs.  There are a few interviews with members of the band, many of which are older radio interviews.  Some are hard to hear and have subtitles.  The interviews overlay still photos and occasional short bits of video footage of the band.  As the DVDs roll on, the viewer sees the same stills and video bits repeated over and over again, ad nauseum.  There are exerpts of Led Zeppelin songs in the background, but no extensive concert footage.  Overall, this boils down to a lame documentary of Led Zeppelin.
B0010X745K|4.0|This was one of the better horror movies I've seen in a while.  Good characters, suspense, great monsters.  Until the ending.  I don't want to give anything away, but I thought the ending really sucked & made no sense at all.  But even given that, it was still worth the money & a good watch.
B00023B1LC|5.0|2002's \\"The Bourne Identity\\" is an absolutely thrilling (if loose) adaption of Robert Ludlum's 1980 spy novel.  Its cinematic success has launched two equally thrilling sequels to date, featuring Matt Damon as former CIA assassin Jason Bourne.<br /><br />A young man in a wet suit, with two bullet holes in his back, is rescued by the crew of a fishing boat in the Mediterranean Sea.  The young man recovers aboard the vessel, but has no memory of who he is or how he came to be in the water.  His only clue is the number of a Swiss bank account implanted in a metal tube in his hip.<br /><br />The man travels to Zurich and reaches the bank.  His account number provides him access to a safety deposit box, filled with a variety of foreign currencies, a small pile of passports, and a handgun.  The top passport is an American one, in the name of Jason Bourne, with an address in Paris.  The young man goes to the American Embassy in Zurich, where the staff unexpectedly tries to apprehend him and the young man unexpectedly displays astonishing fighting skills in escaping the Embassy.<br /><br />Outside the Embassy, Bourne bribes a rootless young German female named Marie (played with subtle depth by Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris.  Along the way, the two will bond over the mystery of Bourne's identity.  The mystery will deepen in Paris as Bourne realized he is the target of a murderous agency effort to clean up a mistake and as he realizes that keeping Marie alive is now a personal misssion.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Identity\\" features fast-moving, almost breathless action, lots of spy high-tech and technique, and enough convoluted mystery for at least three movies (and counting).  Matt Damon nicely underplays Bourne as a confused but driven man, aware that the clock is ticking in a game he doesn't fully understand.  The movie narrative proceeds on parallel tracks, as Bourne flees across France, while his nominal CIA boss (played with understated urgency by Chris Cooper) and another CIA chieftain (played with sweaty near-panic by Brian Cox) throw both CIA operatives and law enforcement in his path.  Clive Owen has a nice cameo as another CIA assassin; Julia Stiles is introduced in her recurring role as a Paris operative.  The climax of the movie is Bourne's dramatic entrance into a CIA safe house in Paris, there to learn the truth about his identity.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Identity\\" is very highly recommended as the thrilling introduction to the Bourne series.  The Extended Edition features a new beginning and ending to the movie designed to the events of 9/11, which somewhat pre-empted the Cold War context of the movie.  This DVD version also features some nice extras on the making of the movie.ith sweaty near-panic by Brian Cox) throw both CIA operatives and law enforcement in his path.

B0014Z4ON4|5.0|Temple of Doom in many ways is the BEST Indiana Jones film for several reasons. It's nonstop fun and action like the others, but the fictional Thugee villains are a better alternative to the Nazis (who are also reprised pedantically in the Last Crusade) - people affected by Nazi Germany in real life may have a hard time sitting through films that feature them - though negatively and ultimately foiled. Mola Ram is the darkest, most powerful villain of all three films, and the concept of the stones is total fiction, which allows for believable and limitless possibilties in storytelling. The Ark and the Grail, though taken from real life religions, are still fictitious artifacts (Religious people can argue until they're blue in the face) but there must be care in Hollywood handling people's hallowed beliefs, as not to offend. You don't have that handicap with a fictitous Indian Cult. Also, Indy is not acting in his own interest for fame and fortune, but is helping a poor village and saving hundreds of children. That's Superman with a fedora and a whip. Plus, TOD has the best bugs, the best sets, and the bridge scene!!! C'mon!!! The chemistry between Indy and Shorty is great, and Willy wasn't a love interest at all, more of a female sidekick with a hint of romance, but she was never written as a replacement for Marion. Temple of Doom is better than you think. Watch it again. Soon, Kali Ma will rule the world!!!
B00005JPNZ|5.0|\\"Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: In 1957, Indiana Jones is thrust back in action, venturing into the jungles of South America in a race against Soviet agents to find the mystical Crystal Skull. The cast led by Harrison Ford (returning in his signature role as Indiana Jones) is excellent! The directing by Steven Spielberg (who also directed the first 3 Indiana Jones films (1981, 1984, 1989) is excellent! The story (which is based on characters by George Lucas & Philip Kaufman) by Lucas (who also wrote the stories and screenplays to the \\"Star Wars\\" series and \\"Indiana Jones\\" movies) & Jeff Nathanson (who also wrote the screenplay to \\"Catch Me If You Can\\" (2002) & \\"The Terminal\\" (2004) and the screenplay by David Koepp (who also wrote the screenplay to \\"War Of The Worlds\\" (2005), \\"Spider-Man\\" (2002), \\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\" (1997), & \\"Jurassic Park\\" (1993) is excellent! The music by John Williams (who also did the music to all 3 Indiana Jones movies and many of Spielberg's other movies) is excellent! The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski (who has done the cinematography to Spielberg's films since \\"Schindler's List\\" (1993) is excellent! The film editing by Michael Kahn (who also did the film editing to all 3 Indiana Jones movies and many of Spielberg's other movies) is excellent! The casting by Debra Zane (who also did the casting to \\"War Of The Worlds\\", \\"The Terminal\\", & \\"Catch Me If You Can\\") is excellent! The production design by Guy Hendrix Dyas (who also did the production design to \\"X2\\" (2003) & \\"Superman Returns\\" (2006) is excellent! The art direction by Luke Freeborn (who also did the art direction to the upcoming \\"Star Trek\\" (2009), Lawrence A. Hubbs (who also did the art direction to \\"Superman Returns\\"), Mark W. Mansbridge, Lauren E. Polizzi (who also did the art direction to \\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\"), & Troy Sizemore (who also did the art direction to the upcoming \\"Terminator 4\\" (2009) is excellent! The set decoration by Larry Dias (who also did the set decoration to \\"Transformers\\" (2007) & Alyssa Winter is excellent! The costume design by Mary Zophres (who also did the costume design to \\"Catch Me If You Can\\" & \\"The Terminal\\") is excellent! This is an excellent return after 19 years of absence. Ford is back and still in great shape to play Indy. This is just as great as the last 2 Indiana Jones films in the franchise. This is also one of the best films of the summer so far.
6304169558|4.0|*************SPOILER*************    First I will say, I own this movie, and I enjoy this movie. I will also so say that I am truly intrigued by the power, beauty and unpredictable wonder of natures most dangerous natural disaster. Although I enjoyed this movie for the sheer purpose of entertainment, I can certainly understand why tornado fans found this movie to be annoying, farfetched and unrealistic.     The predictable: You know from the first 15 minutes of the movie that Helen Hunts chaser team, armed with the \\"Human Barometer\\", the beat up cars and the outdated equipment would come out on top. You know from the start that Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton would kiss and make up, literally. Jamie Gertz. Her true purpose in this movie was to be someone the audience could relate to. She asked the questions that an audience who doesn't know much about tornadoes would ask. She cried and screamed and showed fear of tornadoes instead of excitement like our main characters. She also filled the holes on the back story, by asking more questions: \\"Who's that guy?\\" or \\"Is this your attempt to get Billy back?\\".    The unexpected: The final duo between the rival gangs. Too bad it didn't add anything to the plot.    The unnecessary: The rival gang really didn't add anything to the movie.  They didn't make for competition, suspense, twist, anything. The trip to the aunts house to eat up all her food, still don't know that point, except maybe for the mini \\"moment in science\\" scene at the table where they tell the audience (Jaime Gertz, and all of us at home that may not know) about different tornado intensity, and how only one of the members have lived through an F5 tornado...ooooooh NOW we understand Helen Hunt's drive. The flying cow (it was just one...he did a double orbit).    The potentially annoying:     1. The cliché that the best place to be to chase 6 tornadoes in one day is Oklahoma and Kansas. In fact, you have enough time to get ahead of the super cell to a descending tornado, no matter where you are in these two states.     2. How Bill and Helen Hunt managed to literally come face to face with a tornado, I mean right in the PATH of a twister, not once, not twice, but THREE times and come out with minor bumps and bruises. First time, they hid under a bridge (big tornado safety no no) to escape the winds of the storm...when we all know that the wind is the least of anyone's concern in a tornado, it's the DEBRIS that is the number one killer....The second time, tornados strong enough to spin their car and send a cow orbiting around them, but leaves them safely on the ground and does NO DAMAGE to the car...and the third time...the dangerously F Tornado, the big finale, JUST ripped apart the barn they crouched in, but left them safe and sound, they were even able to open their eyes and look into the heavens...never once did they get clunked in the head with a wooden beam. Never mind the fact that once the tornado \\"tossed\\" the debris into the path of our heroes, it never moved it again, with the exception of the tree trunk that was sent in a perfect line to blow up the truck.    3. The hail. Nothing more than buckets of ice cubes tossed into the path of our main characters. A real hail storm is just that, a storm and the balls of ice fall at dangerous speeds with enough potential dent the hood of your car and break out a windshield or at least CRACK it...especially if you are really close to a tornado, which on every instance, they were within a 1/2 mile of the twister.     4. How Bill Paxton can look at the updraft of a tornado, and predict where it was going. He could pick up dust from the ground and let it blow from his hand, and know what longitude and latitude the next storm would hit.     5. How the tornado always managed to dissipate right after the Helen and Bill encounter...maybe THEY are the secret to stopping the dangerous storm...after all, Bill \\"The Extreme\\" Paxton got his nude body close enough to a storm to chuck a bottleof whisky in it and that stopped it from touching the ground....**TORNADO FACT** A tornado is not a cloud. It is a column of rotating air. They kick up a cloud of dirt and debris from the air and ground giving the appearance of being a cloud.      Final Thought: This is the kind of movie where, if you have knowledge about tornadoes, you have to absolutely let go of that knowledge to sit back and enjoy this movie. Although this movie is based on a real phenomenon, it really plays on the myths and fears that the average person has about tornadoes, and that's what made this movie successful. I enjoyed the action and the destruction. The plot, although predictable, still kept me engaged until the next tornado scene, and there were many in this film. Hollywood creates movies for entertainment. This movie was entertaining, to say the least. But if you are looking for a documentary of tornadoes, and the lives of real storm chasers, this may not be the movie for you.
B000HEYVD6|5.0|Extraordinary plot throughout the book. Just when I thought I figured a few things out the author threw me a fastball and I was reading late into the night to try and guess again. I just ordered another of his novels. Hope he does not stop writing any time soon.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this because I was getting bored with my normal exercise routine.  I haven't watched \\"The Biggest Loser\\" (we're overseas and don't get American TV), so I had no idea who she was.  I read the reviews and people said she pushes you.  Man, does she ever!  I thought I was in average shape and conditioning - always room for improvement, but I could hold my own.  The Level 1 workout just about did me in!  I thought I could progress through the three levels within about 4 weeks or so.  I'm on Week 3 and just got to Level 2 (and I'm going to be there for a while before I feel like I'm doing it well enough to progress!).    Some reviews said it's high impact, but I wouldn't say it's too bad.  She relies on exercises like jumping jacks, high knees, butt kicks, etc for cardio.  There are a lot of squats and lunges, but she does provide a modified version if your knees bother you (mine do).  Have a couple different hand weights available, too.  Some exercises I can do with my regular weights, but others are new to me, so I needed to go down a mass.    Overall, this workout has done more for my body structure than any other workout I've done.  I still don't have the body I want, but if I stick with this, it will sure get a lot better!
0545003873|5.0|As I am specifically reviewing the audiobook, I won't bore you with too much detail about the story itself, which has already been reviewed extensively by a number of fine reviewers (and therefore it would be almost redundant at this point to describe it in detail here.) I'll just recap briefly -- \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" is an amazingly rich story of an orphan, an automaton, and the rediscovered life of a man who created great works. It is a tale of mystery and suspense set against a rich historical background.<br /><br />Given the fact that this book relies in large part on a series of moving pictures to tell its story (pictures so rich and wonderful that the book earned a Caldecott Award), you might be wondering just how such a tale could be converted into an audiobook format. One important component would necessarily be a great narrator, provided in the form of Jeff Woodman, who has won multiple awards for his work and also starred in productions off-Broadway. The other necessary component would be to provide something as unique as that which the book offers. That is done, in this case, by converting the mini-movies into detailed soundscapes, creating the effect of a \\"silent\\" film. Whereas the book relies on its images to help your imagination soar, the audiobook provides scenes created by sound, aiding the text and your imagination to set the scene.<br /><br />The bonus DVD provided with this audiobook adds greatly to the experience by providing four things -- an exclusive 30 minute interview hosted by author Brian Selznick, a series of mini-movies from the book (again narrated by Selznick), a gallery of artwork from the book and a poem deleted from the book. The interview is very insightful and provides much background on the characters and settings, as well as a look at many of the elements that went into the conception and creation of the book.<br /><br />If you enjoyed \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" as a book, then the audiobook comes highly recommended. Sit down, listen up, and again prepare to be amazed!up, and again prepare to be amazed!

0321525655|5.0|When it comes to PowerPoint presentations I've always been guilty of simply grabbing a standard template and pouring in my bullets.  I never gave much thought to aesthetics, which is why most of my slides look awful compared to the ones in Presentation Zen by Garr Reynolds.<br /><br />I can see why this book sells so extremely well.  It's a beautiful work and features all sorts of great, visual examples to help drive home the author's points.  Here are just a few of the great lessons I learned from reading this book:<br /><br />Don't jump right into the slideware tool...lay out your thoughts using pencil and paper first.  Better yet, do it with pencil and PostIt Notes.  This seemed so backwards to me at first.  After all, I've got the computer so why not use it from the start?  After reading what the author had to say about this though I can see I'd greatly benefit from this initial step.<br /><br />How many times have you been asked, \\"how many slides will you have in your deck?\\"  I get hit with that every time I make a presentation.  I love this excerpt from the book: The number of slides is not the point.  If your presentation is successful, the audience will have no idea how many slides you used, nor will they care.  Obviously you can take this to both extremes, but the point is we should be less focused on the number of slides.<br /><br />How about these two questions that probably don't get enough serious consideration early on: What's your point?  Why does it matter?  Again, I frequently get too hung up on what I want to say and not so much on what I think the audience wants to hear about.  I'm scheduled to make a presentation to a group of grad students in a few weeks and I'm starting to realize I don't know enough about their interests, goals from the session, etc., to properly frame my talk.<br /><br />Don't force your logo onto every slide.  Wow, that one won't go over well with our corporate communication team, but, it makes a ton of sense.  As I think back about all the presentations I've sat through, there seemed to be a direct correlation between the degree of boredom and the number of times the speaker's corporate logo appeared.  Seriously, if you look through this book you'll see templates are for losers.  The most effective slides have few words/numbers and use an attractive graphic to help reinforce the point.<br /><br />Look at each slide as a 3x3 grid and focus graphical elements more in the outer portions of the grid or on the intersection points of the vertical/horizontal lines.  This one really becomes clear when you see it in action.  The book features several wonderful examples that show how this sort of off-center balance is highly effective (and similar to the effect used in photography).<br /><br />Speaking of images, the book features a list of some of the better stock photo sites.  The author's favorite is iStockphoto but I prefer a free alternative called Stock.xchng (also included in the author's list).through, there seemed to be a direct correlation between the degree of boredom and the number of times the speaker's corporate logo appeared.

0452289963|4.0|I fully get what the author is trying to say, but when reading this book I'm having to re-read sentences over and over to grasp what he's saying.  I'm not stupid, but the words that are used are not for the average person.  This is not an easy read, it's very deep.  I'm now going to have to look up the word \\"Iconoclastic\\".  This word is found on page 16. This word means, of characteristic of iconoclasm.  What is \\"Iconoclasm\\"?  It's the attitudes or behavior of an iconoclast.  What is \\"Iconoclast\\"?  It's one who attacks conventional or cherished beliefs and institutions as being false or harmful.  But then on page 35 the author goes on about the word \\"identification\\" stating that this word is derived from the latin word \\"idem\\" meaning \\"same\\".  I sure wish the author would have explained \\"Iconoclastic\\", because I knew the word indentification.  On the back cover of this book it states that Eckhart Tolle is a contemporary spiritual teacher who travels extensively taking his message throughout the world.  I would hope in his next book he can simplify so the whole world can fully grasp it.  I believe his message is VERY important, but you can tend to lose some of the meaning with all his big words.  I'm sure he's a very smart man, but my advice for the author would be to get your word out more clearly, \\"Simplify\\".  I hope there can be more peace, respect and less egotistical people in the world.  I do hope EVERYONE would read this book in hopes of grasping as much as this author is trying to relay.  I would also hope that every parent of a youth athlete read this for the benefit of youth sports.  Parent's egos are crazed in this area.  How can there be peace in the world when people within a small city treat others, especially at the expense of children, so badly because they want their child to be a starter and/or best friends with the coach's kid, or to stand out as the best player. Or a  parent's main reason for coaching team is to make sure his/her kid makes a High School team.  This is small bananas compared with the rest of the world's problems, and in the end of your child's youth sports career what friends do you really have left to respect you?  What child's ego have they crushed through this process too?  This is just an example of egotism that I hear and see everyday.  Respectfully,  A Mom in Oregon
B000YABYLA|3.0|First off, the acting in this movie was great, I was very impressed with the characters and how realistic they personailities were.  However, the life changing events deplicted in the movie were just a bit too casual in reactions.  Pregnancy and growing up with that reality and the society's response was not as realistic as the movie deplicted.  I actually had to break this show up into two parts because it was just difficult to watch.  I don't plan to add this to my library.  I do look forward to watching Ellen Page continue her acting career.
0061120073|5.0|I just bought this for a young lady I know who is graduating High School.  I read it at that age as well, and it is the perfect tale for a young woman on the verge of adulthood as it moves from the children to the young, and eventually middle-aged adults as it tells the multi-generational tale of the Nolan family. Heartbreaking and heartwarming without ever delving into sentimentality and highly, highly reccomended.
0440236738|3.0|\\"GFG\\" is a fast paced novel with lots of twist and turns that keep going til the end of the book, perhaps a few too many of them than what was necessary to keep this one interesting. Its not a terrible novel, but with what i believe to be the wimpiest main character ive ever read in a book, it just reminded me of those really lame lifetime movies on the cable networks. For awhile there I kept thinking the main guy was a woman, for the over the top sensibilities and just plain wussiness that just seem to ooze from this character.  Im used to reading bout guys like \\"Mitch Rapp\\" or \\"Gabriel Allon\\" so this was a major adjustment to a guy who likes \\"ahem\\" the male characters to be more like \\"ahem again\\" men.   Not a bad novel, but not all that great either and wont make it to my personal \\"gotta keep this one\\" shelf.  Like I said, it would make for a typical lifetime movie, not much more.

0060899220|5.0|I read this book long before it had hit the better sellers list and he had launched himself into as he would describe \\"the evil\\" of reality tv fame. (In fact, this was the book that did that for him).  Every once in awhile now, I go back to revisit it.<br /><br />Behind the ever-so dry and lambistic humor which makes him such fun to read are a few pearls of wisdom worth taking from someone who is willing to eat & drink pretty much anything imaginable in the world for the sake of a good epicurean story.<br /><br />But, it's the common sense of it all - that moves me most - and which I quote most frequently to friends even now: Don't order the fish - when it's obvious they're trying to clear it out before it goes bad!, Sunday Brunch - think Mom trying to figure out what to do with all her leftovers (oh, and again, avoid the fish). You probably don't want to ask for to many adjustments to your food at a fine dining establishment (at that point you need to worry more about what the chef is doing to the food than the wait team!) And finally, if you didn't catch this from Top Chef -Chefs have HUGE egos (and Bourdain demonstrates it well) - the best consider themselves tough gladiators of the kitchen - not the great artist you've envisioned.<br /><br />Definitely a great read for anyone who likes to dine out on a regular basis!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I experienced some hesitation ordering this product after reading reviews about the packaging.  I was concerned about scratching discs as other reviewers mentioned.  I finally decided to order the set, and if the packaging looked like scratches would be a problem, I would just replace the inside folders with better disc holders.    I've found that the package is perfectly fine.  I can see how you might scratch the discs if you handle them roughly and use a lot of pressure when handling the disc and the folder, as there is a lip at the top of each pocket.  However, if you handle them carefully and tip the disc slightly when removing and replacing it, which seems to me like the easiest way to get your fingers on the edge of the disc anyway, there's no issue.  I appreciate how little space this takes up in comparison to other series.    My only complaint about the set is that the information of what's on each DVD is in a seperate booklet instead of on each season's folder.  I would prefer to have that at my fingers when I am looking at the DVDs so I can find the episode I'm looking for more easily.  But that's a minor complaint that wouldn't stop me from ordering the set.      We love this box set and series and are enjoying having our own West Wing marathons commercial-free.  It's interesting to view the plot lines again and with a new perspective from today's current events.

B0013527I4|4.0|Growing up Muppet-style wasn't a choice, it was mandatory! From corny jokes and wild band members (Animal was my favorite), to grumpy old men booing in the balcony and listening to singing, dancing, and the acting talent of the day, The Muppet Show still holds nostalgic sway for those of us who grew up watching Jim Henson's puppeted cadre. Season three started off with a bang as singer Rita Coolridge graced the show with her amazing voice and actor Kris Kristofferson decided to rough-up a few of the cast. The show really got blazing, though, during episode four when Gilda Radner took a liking to Kermit, much to the chagrin (and karate chop) of Miss Piggy. But the Muppet brigade took a stunning jolt in episode seven when Alice Cooper was the guest star. Playing with the Muppet band, Alice took the show to a whole new level, showing U.S. audiences that puppets can be topical (and controversial?). It was then that The Muppet Show really started to take wing. Actors, musicians, and many other Hollywood talents began showing up in season three. From the voluptuous Rachel Welch and exceptionally talented Harry Bellafonte, to muscle man Sly Stallone and blonde bombshell Cheryl Ladd, the show gained notoriety from new quarters.<br /><br />The amazing thing about The Muppet Show is that kids and adults can both enjoy it, but on totally different levels. Kids will probably like the physical comedy (watching Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker blow up the lab, or having a dog operate in an episode of Animal Hospital, \\"A show that has gone to the dogs.\\") while adults will be amazed at the interspecies attractions between the likes of Kermit and Miss Piggy, or Gonzo (whatever he is) and his chickens (note the plural there; was he a polygamist?)<br /><br />No mention of The Muppet Show would be complete without noting the supporting cast. Two favorites tend to be Waldorf and Statler, the old hecklers that are perched in the balcony and heave insults and boos at the cast. My other personal favorite is Sam the Eagle (so overly-pompous).<br /><br />Digitally remastered just like seasons one and two, the sound and visual qualities on most HD TVs is quite nice but still iffy in places. If you don't have an HDTV, you'll probably still enjoy it, but I'd recommend seeing it in all its digitally intended glory.<br /><br />This latest release has some interesting packaging that I should mention. The cover-image of Fozzie actually has a soft texture that resembles his fur. Animal packaging? And there are some cool extra features, too:<br /><br />\\"Muppets on Puppets\\" is a sixty-minute feature. Hosted by Jim Henson, it looks at the early formation of the Muppets.

0792163710|5.0|The film opens with the Grand Tetons in the background and Shane (Alan Ladd) riding up to a farmer (Van Heflin as Joe Starrett) working outside his home and asking permission to cross his land. The farmer's young son is playing with a gun and the noise causes Shane to react strongly. We can see that in his world he is used to watching his backside. As Shane is leaving, a group of open range ranchers ride up to intimidate Starrett and his wife (Jean Arthur as Marion Starrett) with whom they have an ongoing battle in the valley. Shane returns and with his gun and presence resolves the situation. He ends up staying and working for Starrett as a hired hand. We become more involved in the ongoing war between the community of farmers who have settled here and the ranchers who want them off the land. On the surface, it seems a classic good versus evil battle. Shane and his white hat against the hired gun of the ranchers(Jack Palance as Jack Wilson) in his black hat. But there is a lot more going on than that at different levels. Who is Shane? Where did he come from? Will the subtle but obvious chemistry between him and Marion develop into anything? How will this dispute be settled when the law \\"is three days away\\" from this remote little town with a saloon, general store, hotel and cemetery stuck in the middle of nowhere? These are people who have left everything behind (somewhere) to begin a new life, a harsh, difficult life. Sociological studies have shown that those who became 'pioneers' were often people on the fringes of society - loners, criminals, etc., people who didn't want or need the law to solve their problems. More often that not, the 'gun' became the law and those most skilled in the use of the gun were the winners. More than just a good vs. evil western, this is an entertaining look at the settling of the western frontier and the people who were involved. [...]

0452289963|1.0|As a few others have stated, I had such high hopes for this book.  I assumed with the tenacity that Oprah is pushing this book it would be so great.  Also, the title \\"A New Earth\\" has such a lovely ring to it, a title filled with hope and promise.  That is what I thought, but I was so wrong.  Please, please, please don't waste your time, money, or energy on this false and misleading teaching.    As a small disclaimer, I never in my life thought I might write a review that would cause others to perceive me as \\"one of those crazy Christians,\\" but that might happen now.  Please bear with me and hear me out.    I started to have unsettled feelings toward this book immediately upon reading it.  However, I told myself, \\"Give it more time.\\"  Even though I am very secure in my beliefs and faith, I am a life-long student to personal growth and do have a very open mind.  I love learning new things and new perspectives, but this book actually started to make me feel physically ill.  I mean truly nausiated, which has never happened before though reading.  I have to admit that I wasn't able to finish it.    In what I read, Tolle's position is that God isn't a real being, but rather a state of consciousness that we are all a part of.  Consequently, everyone is God.  He wants readers to believe that any belief system regarding anything is okay as long as it makes the individual feel good.  He quotes Christ completely out of context and does the thing where he says, \\"Christ said ..., but what he meant was ...\\"  What concerns me most is how many people will be led in the opposite direction of real truth because of the hype and Oprah's emphatic endorsement.    A fellow reviewer says: \\"Max Lucado (he is senior pastor at Oak Hills Church in San Antonio) did a sermon just this last weekend, April 20, 2008, about false teachers. Here are a few excerpts: \\"Take heed that no one deceives you. Many will come deceiving and many will be deceived. You've probably noticed that churches are Petridishes for self-serving egomaniacs who masquerade as ministers of the Gospel [and other non-Gospel teachings]. They boast of insider information with 'God led me to say to you' and 'Heaven [or the Universe] had told me to say.' They position themselves as religious gurus, code breakers, or members of an inner circle [as per Gnosticism].\\" Lucado then described a man in Puerto Rico who claims to be Christ incarnate as well as this book, Oprah and Eckhard Tolle's A New Earth, and continued with, \\"Don't be enamored by large crowds, great television productions, good looks. Stick stubbornly to the question: are these people pointing people to Jesus [as a role model] or pointing people to themselves. If they're pointing people to themselves, get out while you still can!\\"     This is so true, especially here!    There are people searching and searching for truth and meaning to their lives.  They have questions, and desires for more.  They are trying to find answers and in this book Tolle actually promises that through the process of reading the book that the answers WILL come.  Tolle paints a picture that Christ had some decent things to say, but that people didn't really understand what he meant and that the Christian movement was blown completely out of proportion and here we have an organized religion thousands of years later with no merit (because of course God isn't real, because he's God, and you're God, and we're all God with an unchecked ego).  People are going to swallow this garbage like candy because it lets them feel good about believing in anything.  I could also see how it would calm potential internal stuggles with questions like, \\"Do I really need to know Jesus to go to heaven?\\" or \\"Should I be seeking God?\\"  Or people who are anti-Christian or anti-religion in generally (not just Christianity) because they've had horrible life experiences, or because so-called Christians gave them a terrible impression of God, Jesus-followers, Christians, religious peoples, and faith.  Not to mention kind-hearted individuals who have never heard anything really of Christ and only know His name as a figure in ancient history.    What I would love for people to know is that regardless of what you believe or what you've experienced, God loves you more than any person in this world ever could multiplied by a million.  There is true acceptace and purpose through Christ.  He desires intimacy with you above all else and in truly seeking Him, none of this other stuff really matters.  There is true freedom though God, Christ, and the Spirit; freedom that Eckhart Tolle would like to believe he is experiencing but never will as long as he seeks his own glorification and the desire to be super-enlightened and highly intelligent.    Many people, I'm sure Tolle included, see people of religious faith as weak.  We just take life one punch after another and call it God's will.  This is not true, and that perspective isn't freedom either.  Freedom is knowing who God is and who he created you to be while growing and changing to embracing those truths.  There is evil in the world that influences us and talks trash to our subconscious all day long.  The Enemy is the great deceiver, the great mimicker who likes to make us feel guilty or inadequate, who tells us we'll never reach our potential, but builds us up and causes false delight when we're doing or saying something that fulfills our egos.  Eckhart Tolle cannot lead you to any pearl of wisdom that will awaken your life purpose; all you need to do is ask God to reveal it to you.  Just keeping asking until He does, and He will.    Aside from all that, Tolle's writing style is a lot of fluff.  Aside from the Christian persepective, it difficult to extract what all the words mean.  It's not a writing style that is reader-friendly.  It's like Tolle likes to hear himself \\"sound\\" intelligent on paper.  You know the type.    In all, save yourself the trouble and lies and don't buy into the hype, regardlessof what Oprah says.
0375842381|4.0|No point in reviewing the individual books because they don't make sense alone - they are three episodes of a single story. Read \\"Northern Lights\\" (or, as I did first, see the approximately corresponding film \\"The Golden Compass\\") alone, and one is confronted with an odd children's adventure yarn, admittedly rather darker and more sinister in the book than in the watered-down film. However, one (this one anyway) was still tempted to paraphrase Randy Newman:<br /><br />O, who would think a girl and bear<br />Could be well accepted everywhere?<br />It's just amazing how fair<br />People can be!<br /><br />\\"Northern Lights\\" is actually a bit of a bore, and one is tempted to scream \\"GET ON WITH IT!\\" every few pages. However, it is an essential set-up for what follows. \\"The Subtle Knife\\" is a marvellous bit of compulsive page-turning writing as three parallel worlds come into collision and the anti-religious overtones of the trilogy, at which \\"Northern Lights\\" only vaguely hints, come more sharply into focus. The character of Will, the boy from our world, with destiny thrust upon him, is especially appealing.<br /><br />\\"The Amber Spyglass\\", fattest of the three, starts off slowly, but stick with it, because it becomes ever more interesting and fascinating. One (this one anyway) is lost in admiration of Mr. Pullman's prodigious imagination in weaving together all the various and varied elements of this amazing tale. In some cases, the imagination is, to me, just too prodigious, with the creation of wheeled creatures, appealing though they are. However, you will enjoy the ride. The bittersweet ending is especially effective.<br /><br />And the anti-religious message that seems to have upset some people? \\"The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all,\\" states one of Mr. Pullman's heroines. And devout Christians will undoubtedly bridle at his picture of \\"The Authority\\" and indeed his whole take on theology, on which he has partially based his fantasy, with many Biblical ideas (the Garden of Eden) and figures (Enoch) playing a part. However, as I understand it, this God bears little or no resemblance to the God of the Bible, whom Christians worship, and if He does, they should be very worried indeed. And, hey, Christianity has been around for 2000 years now. It should be grown up and able to stand up for itself - and be both ready and able to take a bit of honest examination. Has the faith for which many were prepared to perish in the arenas of Rome with such courage come to the point where a kids' book is a threat? If it has, it's not much of a faith. As for its potential for subverting children, it seems to me to be about as subversive as Harry Potter - and does it not represent a golden opportunity for Christian parents to expound the difference?en of Eden) and figures (Enoch) playing a part.

B000YABYLA|2.0|You have got to be kidding me? What a pathetic comment on Hollywood that this movie could be nominated for Best Picture and Best Actress.<br /><br />The movie was as average as it gets. If the DVD had been defective half-way through I would not have cared one iota. The only redeeming quality was Jason Bateman's performance...and the last 20 minutes of the movie which had some poignancy.<br /><br />Ellen Page is nothing but sarcasm until those last 20 minutes. Sarcasm is not a difficult role to play people! Close your eyes and tell me that she does not sound exactly like Jeanine Garofalo. She is a Jeanine Garofalo protege, I'm telling you. Her character is so unbelievable...and not one adult in the entire movie ever tells her to shut her flipping mouth and act respectful? It's just not believable.<br /><br />And to top it all off, the soundtrack has to be the worst in the history of film. I'm embarrassed for Hollywood over these nominations for this picture.
1401300529|3.0|David Halberstam's untimely death in 2007 puts a deeper weight on this, his last book published later that year, than it really should have to bear. \\"The Coldest Winter\\" is uneven work, both riveting and rambling.<br /><br />Emboldened by a desire to emulate his hero Stalin and aggressively enlarge his communist state, North Korean strongman Kim Il Sung in June 1950 sent his army across the 38th Parallel, a somewhat arbitrary dividing line that separated North Korea from South Korea, backed by the United States. Soon the two Koreas were almost completely united under Kim's firm hand. But then the United States struck back, and the first shooting phase of the Cold War, perhaps its bloodiest in terms of sheer concentration of time, was underway.<br /><br />\\"A shrimp is crushed in the battle of the whales,\\" said South Korea's president, Syngman Rhee, quoting a Korean proverb. Rhee was a big part of the problem in Korea, though, as were a number of other leaders on both sides of the 38th Parallel.<br /><br />Halberstam's book is more about those failures of leadership than the war itself. Most especially, it is an indictment of U.S. commander Douglas MacArthur, a revered figure of his time who Halberstam portrays as stubborn, egomaniacal, and self-distancing.<br /><br />I think Halberstam makes his points very well, better than Halberstam himself apparently believed, as he keeps making them again and again, beating them into the ground like tent poles. It's not enough to say MacArthur didn't spend one night in Korea during the war; it must be repeated twice.<br /><br />If he isn't rounding on MacArthur, Halberstam is holding up for ridicule some other figure of less renown, like Ned Almond, a corps commander and MacArthur's bulldog lackey who dismissed the possibility the Chinese might enter the war well after his troops were already fighting them.<br /><br />That Halberstam's book is readable is without doubt. The first 40 pages, detailing the surprise Chinese assault on U.S. positions, offers the kind of first-person reportage that Halberstam did like no one else. It's a bit disappointing, if necessary, to have to pull away from that to a grander overview of the root causes behind the war. Yet Halberstam gets lost in the brambles with too much backstory.<br /><br />One might expect to get to Inchon, MacArthur's tide-turning invasion against the North, by page 200 in a 650-page book. Instead, one reads there about the 1948 presidential run of Tom Dewey. He actually only devotes a couple of paragraphs to Inchon itself, and only a few pages to the dramatic rollback of North Korea which followed, there mostly to slam MacArthur for pushing on north past the 38th Parallel.<br /><br />The book concludes with MacArthur's dismissal in April, 1951, two more years of Korean conflict left to run. Halberstam assures us we aren't missing much: \\"In the end, there would be no great victory for anyone, only some kind of mutually unsatisfactory compromise.\\"<br /><br />Yet this book seems an unsatisfactory compromise, too. Halberstam may skirt a lot of the more successful battles for the U.S. side, but what he does present in the way of soldiers' stories brings this war to one in a way no writer of his stature had done before. The gritty battles around the Twin Tunnels, for example, of beating off decimating human wave attacks by digging deep and standing firm, forced from me a reckoning of this war's uniqueness and sacrifice both painful and exhilarating.<br /><br />Halberstam's feeling and ability to communicate that human element is \\"Coldest Winter's\\" greatest asset, something you have ample opportunity to notice when he's off on another geopolitical tangent.on reportage that Halberstam did like no one else.

0143036556|3.0|I absolutely loved GGS and highly respect Dr. Diamond as a professor, a writer, and a scientist.  However, this book failed to thrill me in the way GGS did.  Its wandering, highly anecdotal and verbally confounding chapters left out more detail than they were intended to include and lose the reader in twisted rhetoric and \\"smart\\" sounding verbage that really, to the trained scientific eye, is incredibly frustrating and tedious.  Dr. Diamond picked some of the most fascinating societies to explore, and gives the reader an intro to each, but I think with some revisions and editing to his journal-like writing style, at least twice as much information could have been included, much in the way GGS was incredible dense, but equally informative.  I hate to say it, but I really was at times bored with this book, and wish I hadn't bought it new.  GGS remains on my top shelf, where I can access it almost daily, but this one I have a feeling will end up as either kindling or a gift to a less critical friend...
0441172717|5.0|People had been recommending this book to me for years.  I had avoided it, convinced it could never stack up to my first epic love, Lord of the Rings.  I'd seen bits and pieces of the Dune film here and there on cable, and wasn't impressed.  I spotted it in paperback last month at a garage sale for $0.25, finally caved and decided to just read it.      I so regret the wasted years!  I was engrossed from the first page.  Frank Herbert created an amazing and rich universe, complex enough to satisfy this Tolkien fanatic.  Plenty of reviews offer synopsis; I will just suggest giving it a chance.  I'll be reading the others in the series, and I'll surely be revisiting Book 1 in the future.
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|I couldn't find a Meaningful Title for this review but I don't think Antonioni would mind.  I loved his Italian trilogy in black and white (La Notte, L'Aventurra and L'Eclisse ) (excuse probable faulty spelling)and stood in line to see Blow Up when it hit New York in the 60's.  Wow...Antonioni in English and in color!  I loved it but I hadn't a clue about what it meant.  To me it was surface, color, style and glamour.  I was young and arty and impressionable.      Now I'm seeing it again and, of course, the stuff that made it so cool back then--sex, drugs and rock and roll--are funny and quaint.  But the film is still so good.  I still don't worry my head about what it means--like a Matisse--I personally just enjoy it.  I take it in and it feels good and it affects me.  Later, I may have some insight about its meaning.  It is so good that it has to have something besides surface beauty.      Antonioni had his finger on the happening scene at the time.  It was a time of huge cultural change and one can read lots of books about what that meant.  He just went there and shot this.  It's a snap shot, maybe, of a moment in time--a very nice snap shot.  People can look at it, at their leisure, maybe and figure out what it means to them.      I think A. is an artist who escapes being overly arty.  Yes, the mimes were annoying but that's because we've seen them copied over and over since then--at the time they were fresh and had some sort of meaning--oops--there's that word again--meaning.      I didn't like it as much as the 3 Italian black and whites but I think I liked it better than Zabriskie Point.  Maybe he knew his own culture best.      I do remember that, after this film hit, you couldn't walk around New York without some young guy photographing you.  I remember falling asleep on the grass in Central Park, only to wake up, finding a guy's lens right  about six inches from my face.  The David Hemmings character who was supposed to be shallow bred a whole generation of wannabe sexy guy photographers.

0446691437|5.0|I had a good time reading the pages of this book and found myself laughing out loud, and enjoying how Steven Pressfield shares how to break through the blocks and win our inner creative battles. He explains in great detail how resistance works in life and can sabotage us from pursuing our dreams (big and small). He explains where procrastination comes from and the many faces it can take on so one can tackle it and stop it from ruling our lives.<br />While reading, I thought that a great follow up to this book is [[ASIN:1888043040 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation]] by Ariel and Shya Kane because their book presents 3 principles of Transformation that have supported me in shifting that very resistance Steven describes. After reading the Kane's books, (the other two are [[ASIN:1888043148 How To Create a Magical Relationship]] and [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]]), all aspects of my life have transformed and the pursuing of my dreams happens effortlessly and organically.<br />I strongly recommend these books to anyone who wants to unlock their true potential and live the life of their dreams.
B000M06K5C|5.0|Now, I loved Silent Alarm as much as anybody else.  Bloc Party became one of my very favorite new bands after listening to that album.  The sparse, spiky guitars, persistent drumming, and melodic vocals made for a brilliant album that hearkened back to the punk and post-punk movements of the 70s and 80s.  A Weekend In The City, Bloc Party's follow-up, is a very different animal altogether.  The guitar sound is roughly the same, but the vocals have a softer, almost blurry quality to them, the drums might as well have been drum machines (but they are still amazing), and the song content is darker and more melancholy.  If Silent Alarm was the Saturday night out on the city, A Weekend In The City is the hang over of the Sunday morning...blurry, atmospheric, abashed, and slightly angry.  And it works very well.    \\"Song For Clay\\" starts out the album with a simple vocal and guitar melody that turns into pounding drums and clashing guitars, but it's not quite as explosive as the rockers on Silent Alarm, it still sounds vulnerable.  \\"Hunting For Witches\\" is a description of how the media has used \\"fear to keep us all in place\\", employing electronic-sounding guitars to fill as a symbol of modern paranoia, truly a standout track.  \\"Waiting For the 7.18\\" is one of my personal favorites, with a somber melody dissolving into blissful noise pop behind the refrain \\"Let's drive to Brighton on the weekend.\\"  \\"The Prayer\\" is a slightly weird track, with synth and drums backing the harsh, abrasive verse, and a sweet little guitar melody serving as the backdrop for a chorus that contrasts well with the verse.  \\"Uniform\\" is a song about the conformity of teens,  with soft guitar becoming a riveting guitar solo.  \\"On\\" provides a drug ballad, with gorgeous, melancholic lyrics such as \\"Drunken 'I love you's at the top of the world...and when it runs out, we buy more, a flatness so bleak, I've been bitten by a vampire\\".  \\"Where Is Home?\\" is similar to \\"Prayer\\" in song structure, and is oneof the weaker tracks on the LP.  It is quite possibly the angriest song on A Weekend In The City, but instead of angsty lyrics, it is a resigned anger about racial injustice.  \\"Kreuzberg\\" is an underrated song detailing the love the narrator wishes he could find after so many one-night stands.  It is a perfect example of the vulnerability that wasn't present on their previous effort.  \\"I Still Remember\\" is a radio-friendly single concerning an attraction between two schoolboys.  \\"Sunday\\" is a very atmospheric song that lifts off the ground on its fragile melody.  \\"SRXT\\" is a perfect closer to the album, a sad ballad about suicide.    One thing I mentioned a lot in the review was the word \\"melody\\", and it is appropriate, as the melody is pushed to the forefront more so than in Silent Alarm.  Kele Okereke's lyrics serve perfectly to describe a vulnerable, confused young man in the middle of a city with nowhere to turn, surrounded by hypocrisy, corruption, and depression.  It's a much darker album, lyrically, but it's a beautiful darkness, with the lyrics serving as a perfect counterpoint to the musicality of the album.  There have been a lot of negative reviews for this album, but personally, I feel it is just as strong as Silent Alarm, but it needs a lot more time to grow on you.  But what really makes it so appealing is that Bloc Party did not give us more of the same, but took their music in a new and beautiful direction.  I can't wait to hear what comes next.

Definitely recommend this book.
B00139W3NE|1.0|I cannot believe the hype about this movie. I admit, I was wary about the  movie because if the author and the anti-Christian reviews.  But after seeing this film, I think the real horror is that children may die from being bored to death.  Where was the plot?  My husband and I laughed at the ridiculous plot, weak character development, and the 80's-looking special effects.  I expected beautiful special effects because of the trailer on TV and the other reviews, however, the effects for laughable.  If you want a good laugh, grab a glass of wine and watch this ridiculous tale.  If you are looking for a movie with a plot, search elsewhere.  If you are a parent worried about the anti-Christian author - don't worry about this movie.  Most likely, your children will search elsewhere for entertainment.
B00005JPNZ|1.0|Let me start of by saying that I am a HUGE Indiana Jones fan, so, needless to say, when they announced a fourth one, I FLIPPED OUT!  Of course, the movie was a disappointment, even with my low expectations (Yes, even though I couldn'twait to see it, my expectations were low).      One thing that I did not like about this film was about how often the famous whip was used. It was hardly used after the noteworthy first scene.  Also, there is no love-hate relationship! How can it be Indiana Jones and NOT have a love-hate relationship.  I also found the ending of the movie pretty senseless.  It cuts from a shot of Indy, Mutt, and Marion overlooking the newly flooded and destroyed temple to a wedding back in the States.  My advice: After they escape the temple with the aliens, leave the theater.      Something else that I gfound plain stupid was that Indiana Jones survived a nuclear blast by hiding in a partly lead refrdgerator!  Another major mistake in the film, and it was probably the worst, was, well, let's put it this way: UFOs and aliens do NOT belong in an Indiana Jones film!!!    Also, the plot was sort of confusing, and it gave you hardly any time to rest once it got started.  Finally, the skull itself seemes to be weightless.  It was supposed to be made out of pure crystal, yet it gets literally tossed around like it's a plastic skull with syran wrap crinkled up inside it (It looked like it, and I can almost gaurntee that that was what the makers of the film made it out of).    I must give the makers their props, however, for not putting in too much CGI for this day and age, and I found the part where a snake was used as a rope to be funy, though I found it hard to believe it was a rat snake and that it would not have torn in half.    Overall, this was an embrassment to the Indiana Jones triology.  I, as a dedicated fan, am ashamed to call this an Indiana Jones film.
B000UNYJXQ|3.0|This is Michael Moore's least entertaining documentary, but it is maybe his most important one so far. Anyone who has spent time with Moore's documentaries and heard the critics will realize in Sicko than the detractors have been semi-right all along, because when it comes to propaganda, Sicko maybe his most half-truths laden work to date... but he does do it well.<br /><br />With this ambulance it is impossible for the neigh Sayers to claim that Moore is balanced or impartial. Moore can take a topic like America's failing healthcare system and then push it so that Cuba is helping 911 rescue workers get medical care. Of course it is all mountains of misinformation built on hills of truth and we know that Cubans aren't getting what those 911 rescue workers got, so why do we watch him? Moore raises questions and does it in a way that makes his points interesting. If the same points were made in any other way it would scarcely raise an eyebrow, but Moore is capable of making something important that gets under our skin. He makes us think, and makes good arguments, even if it does mean we have to bare the hyper velocity spin, and does it go around and around at times.<br /><br />Sicko does make an important case. Capitalism at its most selfish kills. This is undeniable. The problem is has Moore sold America on a socialized healthcare system? The truth is that he does make a good case for it and seems to indicate that politicians took some nice pay checks not to endorse it. Sicko is absolutely fascinating stuff but Moore does test our gullibility.
B0014127BO|5.0|I just picked this up and love it.

B00139W3NE|3.0|The Golden Compass (TGC) starts off very quickly, getting into the story and action right away as mysterious 'dust' seems to threaten the tension between a community of scientists and clergy in a distant world where the inhabitants' souls take the form of animals that they walk with. Children are going missing and the young Lyra Belacqua is given a mysterious compass that may have the power to open the doorway to other worlds and collapse the power of the Magesterium.<br /><br />For all intents and purposes the film is one big build up to Lyra meeting the bear Iorek Byrnison for a big bear fight. After that it quickly goes downhill, leaves the question of what `dust' is open and ends abruptly with a `to be continued...'<br /><br />TGC does look really good and a lot of effort has gone into giving it high production values, however fans of the Dark Materials books are likely to sneer rather than reveal in it and for all its interesting moments there are an equal amount of dull ones. None the less it is worth watching but everyone ends up with the feeling that they should be turning pages instead of watching frames per second instead.

0778321606|3.0|Two-time cancer survivor Lydia decides that she is going to live life to the fullest (well, we'll see about that) and open up a yarn & knitting shop in Seattle. Through her shop & the beginning knitting class she offers she makes friends & we see the lives of four very different women - who aren't really all that different in the end.    My initial thoughts while reading it were as follows:    (around page 114) - This book as quite a few thoroughly unlikeable characters, but I feel myself drawn to read on. Maybe I'm hoping they will realize the error of their ways and repent by the end of the novel?    (around page 247) - I don't really like the way the narratorial voice switches from first-person POV for Lydia's chapters to third-person POV for the other three main characters. Also, Lydia doesn't quite like to stay speaking in the past tense. It bothers me, and makes me think Ms. Macomber's editor could have done a better job.    My thoughts now that I've finished it:    Yes, it has some trite moments, and the writing style bothers me at points, but I'll be reading the next book in the series, and I think I'll give her Cedar Cove series a try, as well. Perhaps even her romances. Knowing that Debbie Macomber is a romance writer, I knew that there were going to be happy endings pretty much all 'round - and I wasn't disappointed. Everyone (except one character) ends up happy. The one thing that bothered me was Alix's transformation from semi-punk girl to \\"pretty\\" girl in order to be happy. Yes, the young man she ends up with liked her before the transformation, but it bothered me that Macomber felt the need to physically transform Alix before giving her the happy ending. What's wrong with a punk/goth girl being happy?    Overall, this book is a feel-good read for knitters and non-knitters alike. Knitters will understand the friendship that knitting provides, and non-knitters will still like the story following the four women. If you don't mind semi-predictable happy endings, go for this book - I mean it!
B000P0I4O4|3.0|The Contract is a well done enough drama that attempts to be a bit more than what it is. That said, it is clearly Morgan Freeman who carries the weight of this otherwise forgettable movie on his shoulders as a hitman with a heart-as long as it's not you who happens to be the target of his latest contract. John Cusak as the middling dad forced into a bad situation has to overcome some implausibly bad odds at times as he outwits Freeman's cohorts and another assassin intent on killing Freeman (it will come as no surprise as to who hired this cheeseball). There are plenty of moments where the characters get to know each other that Freeman plays beautifully. The actor playing Cusak's son offers no chops whatsoever as a teen troubled with the usual vice of pot smoking and he delivers lines more mechanically than the robot on Lost in Space. He is a complete waste as is much of the writing for his character. The backdrop of the film, the wonderful wooded vistas provide visual fodder and were clearly the director's main interest. If you like Morgan Freeman and John Cusak, The Contract is a likable enough film, but is littered with many issues that are difficult to overcome even if you are a veteran watcher of such movies. 3 stars...barely

Fourteen years after Body Snatchers: the invasion continues, an under-appreciated nicely executed sci-fi thriller, we are now subjected to a new tale of a spore threat that spreads by way of a virus. This time, the nasty business of having to deal with the disposal of useless shells of humans after pod conversion, is completely unnecessary. The virus simply merges with human DNA and the alien consciousness takes control of the host body as they sleep. The spreading of the virus is accomplished through a mucous spit spray, the movie's main downfall as this type of transmission has been done countless times before in different sci fi vehicles. Since we miss out on the special effect heavy scenes of transformation that populate previous pod propulsion, There is plenty of time for suspense laden scenes filled with the dread and impending doom as the takeover of humanity seems unstoppable. Nicole Kidman and the boy playing her son are absolutely terrific and believable as they try to resist the onslaught. They outwit the zombie-esque populous at every turn in subtle and not so subtle ways. Now for the bad: Daniel Craig is horrendous as Kidman's love interest. He displays less humanity before conversion and more emotion afterward. A complete disparity when the rest of the cast largely compliments the decent (tough dumbed down)script. With the focal point of the movie being the quick takeover of humanity, the science equation suffers enormously as there is little sense of the slow building progress and understanding of the alien presence that we experienced in the previous pod adventures. Instead, we have quick explanations that only seem to be a way to provide a brief break from the suspenseful scenes. I enjoy these types of movies when they provide a plausible chain of events around the learning of how the alien pathology works and the steps we need to take to stop it. The Invasion fails here considerably, and therefore gets a lower rating because of it. There are several political allegories that seem forced rather than a subtle side benefit as in previous films as well, adding to discomfort. So, the moral is, if you want a decent thriller to get your heart racing, it's here in The Invasion, but if what you're really looking for is an intelligent sci fi vehicle that truly delivers the goods, it may be better for you to see the other Invasions of the pod people. 3 stars
B000T9OP7G|5.0|If you haven't seen this show yet, you really should buy this dvd set and watch it with out distractions.  It not only rejuvenates the Terminator movies, but it amplifies them with deeper plot material, great acting, and incredible action right from the start!  This show is flat out AWESOME!!! A must see, and I was so glad to hear recently that Fox is renewing the show for another season.  FOX Executives, are you listening to the millions out there supporting this show and giving you millions in dollars??? You will be making a killing on this short episode dvd set, so keep the show going, and reap the rewards!!!  Quite simply, the best show on tv today!    P.S. The viewers also get a TOTALLY HOT TERMINATOR BABE!!!
B00026WU7I|5.0|Every time I hear Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts -- as I did just now on the bike on a perfect NYC Memorial Day along the Hudson River (as it happens in the version by Mary Lou's Cadillac, but that's another story) -- I think it obviates the need to ever read a history of the American West.  OK, that's a little overstatement, but, hey, we live in the Age of Hyperbole.      And that's just one of ten cuts on this album, each one of that caliber.  I think an argument could be made that Blood marks Dylan moving from chronicler of his life and times to chronicler of American life and times, as he has become definitively with his last three albums.    In any event, this is a must for every music collection.
0618680004|1.0|Scientists say that we use our senses and perceptions to gather objective evidence that leads by valid logical deductive inference to the scientifically reproducible discovery that an idea that something exists is true and that is how verification is achieved. What happens if there is a failure to achieve verification because of an absence of evidence that leads by valid logical deductive inference to the scientifically reproducible discovery that the idea that something exists is true? Some like Richard Dawkins maintain that in the absence of evidence and until proven otherwise the rational default position is a belief in non-existence. The meaning of the word rational is logical, sane, and or consistent with or based on reason. The meaning of the word default is to fail to do something that is required. The something that is required by scientists is the verification of the truth of the idea that something exists.<br /><br />Certainly this provides a way of dealing with those who make wild claims such as: There is an alien spaceship buried fifty miles beneath Manhattan; George W. Bush is the reincarnation of Julius Caesar; and or Elvis's ghost is living on Pluto. Maybe a better way of dealing with such claims is to ask: Have you ever actually used your senses and perceptions to gather objective evidence that leads by valid logical deductive inference to the scientifically reproducible discovery that the claim you are making is true? If the person making the wild claim replies no; then respond: If you can not say that you have used your senses and perceptions to gather objective evidence that leads by valid logical deductive inference to the scientifically reproducible discovery that your claim is true then your claim is a myth. If your claim is a myth, then it is a lie for you to claim that this myth is truth. This is a round about way of calling the person making the wild claim a liar; because it is a lie to claim that myth is truth.<br /><br />The problem with the taking such a default position and applying it to a belief in the existence of divine eternal parts of existence that I call soul and spirit is the results produced; are not a definite conclusion; and are not valid. When an argument uses valid logical deductive inferences to arrive at a conclusion, then all other possible conclusions are systematically eliminated as possibilities leaving only one definite conclusion. The conclusion that divine eternal parts of existence that I call soul and spirit do not exist is one definite conclusion. Therefore this one definite conclusion must be based on an argument that uses valid logical deductive inferences to eliminate all other possibilities. The absence of evidence is not the proof of absence and therefore does not lead by valid logical deductive inference to the scientifically reproducible discovery that soul and spirit do not exist. The assertion that in the absence of evidence and until proven otherwise the rational default position is a belief in the non-existence of soul and spirit leads to an arbitrary choice of one conclusion over all other possible conclusions.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is: The presence of the universe is presence of evidence. The presence of evidence in the form of the universe leads by logical valid inductive inference; both to the conclusion that soul and spirit exist; and to the conclusion that soul and spirit do not exist. I simply do not have enough evidence to determine at this time if either of these two conclusions is correct. Both ideas are myths because both ideas are the result of conclusions reached by use of inductive reasoning. The logical meaning of the word valid is: Containing premises that lead by logical valid inference to a conclusion. The presence of evidence in the form of the universe provides premises that lead by logical valid inductive inference; both to the conclusion that soul and spirit exist; and to the conclusion that soul and spirit do not exist. Therefore both conclusions follow from arguments are that logically valid; because both arguments are built using valid inductive reasoning. Both conclusions are valid possibilities.<br /><br />Therefore the possible follow up assertion that in the presence of evidence in the form of the universe and until proven otherwise the rational default position is a belief in the non-existence of soul and spirit leads to an arbitrary choice of one myth over an infinite, number, diversity and variety of myths made possible by the mystery of existence and only limited by our creative abilities and powers of imagination. Therefore the choice of the myth of the non-existence of soul and spirit as a default position is arbitrary. If the choice of the myth of the non-existence of soul and spirit as a default position is arbitrary, then I should not settle for the myth of non-existence of soul and spirit as my default position. If the choice of default position is arbitrary, then I should not settle for anything less than the myth of the existence of soul and spirit as my default position.<br /><br />Another meaning of the word valid is: producing desired results. The idea; that in the presence of evidence in the form of the universe and until proven otherwise; the default position is a belief in the non-existence of soul and spirit; produces pessimistic thoughts, beliefs and expectations about existence. The idea; that in the presence of evidence in the form of the universe and until proven otherwise; the default position is a belief in the existence of soul and spirit; produces optimistic thoughts, beliefs and expectations about existence. In light of scientific research that seems to affirm the theory that our optimistic thoughts, beliefs, and expectations about existence have a positive influence on our health; pessimistic thoughts, beliefs and expectations about existence; that follow from a belief in the non-existence of soul and spirit produce undesirable results; and therefore equate with an invalid choice of default position. Given that our various health behaviors, our immune functions, and our biochemical functions are believed by scientists to be improved by our optimistic thoughts, beliefs, and expectations about existence in ways that make our bodies more resistant to illness and better able to recover from existing disease; optimistic thoughts, beliefs and expectations about existence; that follow from a belief in the existence of soul and spirit; produce desirable result; and therefore equate with a valid choice of default position.<br /><br />If the choice of default position is arbitrary, then there is no reason to settle for simply choosing a belief in a myth that produces optimistic thoughts, beliefs and expectations about existence; such as those; that follow from the myth that divine eternal soul and spirit exist. If the choice of default position is arbitrary; and it is; then I choose as my default position a belief in the one myth that enables me to have the most optimistic thoughts, beliefs and expectations about existence. In presence of evidence in the form of the universe, and until proven otherwise, I choose as my default position a belief in the one myth that enables me to have the highest esteem of existence. Even if doing so causes me to create a model of existence that is not in accord with actuality, at least I might have a happier and perhaps healthier life. Why be a pessi-mystic? Why not be an opti-mystic?<br /><br />His book may be painstaking well written and documented.

B0017U7PT6|1.0|I went go see this movie thinking it would be a wild action ride of a movie like the preview made it out to be.  I was wrong big time it was very slow and drawn out throughout most of the movie.  Also I know it is  a movie but it was just so historically innacurate.  They had domesticated horses which weren't around until 4000 BC.  The only animals domesticated back then were Dogs, Sheeps, and Goats. They also used hancuffs which werent invented until at least 1 A.D. if not later.  The story is also riduculous. So I am just giving you a warning I never received this movie stinks. Spend your money on something better like Cloverfield or Charlie Wilson's War.
B0013NAP2G|1.0|I've seen this DVD and nearly fell asleep! I couldn't believe how lifeless her show was! She didn't do anything but wobble around on high heels! No wonder she didn't sell out all her shows! ...and she is SO FAT! I HIGHLY recommend Madonna's Confessions tour DVD!!....THAT WAS A GOOD SHOW!!!
B0000E6I1J|5.0|\\"Concert For George\\" is the epitomy of how an artist tribute should be executed. This all-star bow to George Harrison captures his very essence. Apart from timeless music, one quickly notices the sterling arrangements, performances and quality of presentation. The DVD is a technical marvel and<br /> could have easily been a 3 disc set had they decided to include \\"Crackerbox Palace\\", \\"This Song\\", \\"Blow Away\\", \\"Cheer Down\\", \\"When We Was Fab\\" and more of George's Beatle songs. I'd  gladly pay another $20.00  for an expanded set!
0060764899|5.0|There are a very few treasures in this world that never lose their magic. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is one of them. It has been almost twenty years since I first read this book, and I still get goose bumps. It's not one of the deepest or most poetic pieces of literature, but it is truly one of the most magical. \\"Magical\\" is really the word to describe this enchanting novel. It's very, very simplistic as it works its powers on the child imagination. A wardrobe that is a door into a magic realm that needs to be saved from eternal winter. Even after many readings and many years, I still feel the beauty and the darkness of the book. I still get a little freaked out by the paranoia of the trees listening in. And I still feel the incredible power and joy of the melting snows. C.S. Lewis' masterpiece is deceptively simple. He takes the ordinary and turns it into pure magic. He plays with the child's imagination. He creates darkness in simplicity. The simplicity is enchanting rather than dull. The characters are fantastic and utterly charmingly enchanting, from the brat and betrayer Edmund (my favorite) to the kind goodness of Lucy to the sympathetic and conflicted Mr. Tumnus the faun to the frightening and awe-inspiring Aslan and the White Witch. The simple and allegorical story of saving Narnia through sacrifice and redemption isn't really the point. The point is the magic of it all. One of my all time favorite books. One of the books that formed my imagination and my brain. Grade: A+
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Released in '77 `Star Wars' was the movie that launched the George Lucas Dynasty and mega merchandising empire, the film that gave us; The Force, Jedi Knights and light sabers. For those additions into the sci-fi lexicon I say, \\"Thank-you George Lucas.\\" Let me also say that I was not then or now one of those avid lovers of the `Star Wars' films. The only aspect of the storyline that really captured my interest was the Jedi Knights with their mystical connection to \\"The Force' and the extraordinary powers that come by utilizing it.<br /><br />Looking at the original version now 31 years later it appears obviously dated (as would be expected) and a little overly comedic for my personal tastes. However with or without my consent the legacy of this film cannot be denied. The iconic images of Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo, the John Williams soundtrack and much of the dialogue and robotic sound effects have become so imbeded in our consciousness that they instill comfort and assurance when viewed or heard. That alone makes this film worthy of a -5 Star- rating.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|I understand what the filmmakers were trying to do here, but it was already done in the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  All CLOVERFIELD does is take the \\"found\\" amateur video to a high tech level, with some impressive visual results, but not enough investment on the viewers behalf. Whereas one could almost believe the mythology of BLAIR WITCH as something that might have really happened, we all know the major event that is depicted in CLOVERFIELD never happened and it was only a movie.  So, why not make it a movie. The shaky hand-held camera is highly distracting for the most part (do not see this movie in a theater if you are susceptible to motion sickness!) and does not allow for the full enjoyment of the special effects. In one of the special features on the disc, one of the film-makers notes the enduring status of the Godzilla monster in Japan and suggests that Americans need their own monster hero.  I submit that Clover is not it based on this movie.  Unlike Godzilla of the Japanese films, the character and origins of Clover is not established enough to make it notable. Perhaps this can be done in another Clover movie, or better yet a remake of this one without the visually annoying hand-held cameras.  By the way, speaking of the special features, the documentaries are fairly interesting so don't forget to watch them if you watch the movie-- they will add to your appreciation of what the film-makers did do with CLOVERFIELD.
B00151HZME|4.0|A great effort and probably a more authentic take on the '80's sound than say The Killers.  I love the screeching My Bloody Valentine synth on \\"Kim & Jessie\\", but the recording is seriously compromised by some very lousy drumming.  Get a drum machine if you can't find someone who can play.

B000002MIF|2.0|I bought this album a year ago instead of 'Meat Is Murder', because I had heard 'How Soon Is Now' on the radio and I figured I should get the original album that it was released on rather than 'Meat Is Murder'. I was wrong. Although there are some witty lyrics and tricks of the tongue found here, very few of the tracks vary at all from one consistant vein of music, the same guitar riffs, the same vocal 'ah-ha-ha's. The album is very boring, I won't lie. I tried listening to it about a dozen times and every time I thought 'when will this side end?'. Now, I'm not completely putting down The Smiths. Get 'Meat Is Murder' if you like 'How Soon Is Now'. It blows this compilation out of the water. This compilation of B sides and outtakes of the first album should've stayed in the archives.
1582701709|3.0|I was intrigued by the book and the movie, but found myself wanting to know more about how to really apply this in my life. I think the movie in particular did a great job at bringing this information to the masses in an especially unique way- but it kind of left me hanging as to what to do next.   I finally found the answer to that question in Jack Canfield's new book on the Law of Attraction- [[ASIN:0757306586 Jack Canfield's Key to Living the Law of Attraction: A Simple Guide to Creating the Life of Your Dreams]]it picks up where the Secret left off and shows me how to really apply this principle in all areas of my life. Ultimately, I suggest Jacks LOA book as a primer and a companion to the Secret dvd so that you have the information and the action steps for really living this way!
B001714PTS|5.0|As Sweeney Todd is my favorite musical, it is thus one of 2 of my favorite movies. If blood and music is your thing, then this film is for you perfectly done by Johnny Depp and Tim Burton. I was tickled pink as soon as I heard the film was announced. Johnny Depp was cast before anyone had heard him sing, but I knew it would work out. There were many uncertainties since it is one of the most difficult musicals on broadway. For me, the film is better than the musical because it is different but the musical itself stays the same. This is what REALLY got me into musicals. The fact that it is so is what makes it genius. With the Steelbook version, you not only get the first DVD with one special feature, but you also get a whole bunch of other goodies on the second one about how they made the film. Including stuff with Stephen Sondheim, it also talks about the legend of Sweeney Todd and how they made the gallons of blood and most of the other things in the film. As for the casting, it is flawless. Johnny Depp's portrayal is creepy and saddening at the same time. You learn of the pain he endured when his past was ripped apart and his singing is done well with a perfect British dialect. Helena Bonham Carter is not the best singer in the movie, but she is good enough to be the second lead role, in fact she is great. The film is detailed from the opening credits to the very tragic end. Sweeney's thirst for revenge increased as time went by and it changed many things about everybody. Alan Rickman, as always is a total delight and is a good duet with Johnny Depp. The lyrics in the songs carry the story and tell you what the characters are thinking so pay attention, because they have some truth in them. Don't expect a happy musical here, but do expect a phenomenal experience. How I love this film so much!! You're in for a fan-bloody-tastic time with the amazing music. Hope this helped.
0757307272|5.0|This is yet another great tool for teens from Jack Canfield...<br />Let's give them ALL the tools and inspiration we can to achieve success in life. I also recommend his latest book on the Law of Attraction [[ASIN:0757306586 Jack Canfield's Key to Living the Law of Attraction: A Simple Guide to Creating the Life of Your Dreams]] for teenagers- After reading it myself I bought it as a gift for several teens as well. Both of these are written on a level that speaks to all ages!<br />Thanks Jack!

B0012K1ILW|3.0|In 200? Erykah surprised/shocked a few people with the release of `Love Of My Life' a duet with Common dedicated to hip-hop (she even raps on the video). This was a little bit unusual for the lady who had built a reputation as the neo-soul queen. Truthfully that track should not have been so surprising as the 1st single to her previous album sampled none other than Dr Dre (Xplosive from 2001).  It was therefore not such a huge shock when I learned that the 1st single to her new album was produced by 9th Wonder (great video). What did shock me however was how far she takes the hip-hop influence in her album.<br /><br />Most soul singers would have gone with Will.I.Am, Wyclef Jean, Kanye West or even The Neptunes (see Estelle) to create a radio ready but hip-hop sound. Ms Badu goes underground (in an attempt to channel the late great J Dilla) choosing Madlib (MF Doom), 9th Wonder (Little Brother) and chief contributors Sa-Ra Creative Partners.<br /><br />The result is a disjointed effort which at first listen sounds like a mixtape styled blending of rhymes over beats. The production tends to be the dominant presence in this album when it was her voice (and skilled penmanship) that fuelled her past albums. Erykah herself also strays from her mainstay of melodies that accentuate her voice and opts for chants that are delivered in a rap like fashion, `The Cell'. As if taking a queue from collaborator Georgia Ann Muldrow she even distorts/contorts her voice to create an instrument sounds on `The Cell', `Twinkle' and `Master Teacher'.<br /><br />Only in the final quarter of the album does Erykah return to the style that she is best known for. `That Hump' and `Telephone' leave you wishing that the album could continue for another 30 minutes.<br /><br />After several listens however you as you begin to grasp the politically charged lyrics and you grow accustomed to the musical stylings of Sa-Ra the album starts to grow on you. And while it is far from my favourite Erykah CD it does have a place in my collection; next to J Dilla's \\"Donuts\\", filed under the section WAY AHEAD OF ITS TIMEction; next to J Dilla's \\"Donuts\\", filed under the section WAY AHEAD OF ITS TIME
B00005JPNZ|5.0|Just what I said, a fun movie, one that I would see again.  And for all of the people who seem to say that this movie is not realistic, my question for them is which one of them is?  Indy would be dead 100 times over and that's just for starters.  Take it for what it is, summer entertainment, and you won't be upset.
B00104QSOM|5.0|This long film (by today's standards) is riveting at all times, thanks to the vision and control of Paul Thomas Anderson. It's been said that Daniel Day-Lewis only re-channelled his performance as Bill the Butcher (Gangs of New York), but here he's in almost every scene, and the performance is as complete as it can get; the nastiest performance to win an Oscar since Hannibal Lechter or Aileen Wuornos.  He deserved the Oscar. I longed for some information regarding Mr. Plainview's previous history, and the appearance of Kevin J. Dillon as his step-brother was a great sub-plot. It's the only time Plainview showed any concern for anyone but himself. None of it turns out good. Rehashing the plot wouldn't make sense, but this is a finely crafted film, rich in detail and excellent cinematography. I also enjoyed Paul Dano (L.I.E.; Little Miss Sunshine), who showed range of character throughout. One argument is that the 2-disc DVD is inadequate, regarding Disc 2, and that is correct. Most interviews are repetitive, and it included some old documentary footage of the importance of oil...duh...?! Anyway, it's a worthy film. Check it out!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Now, is it just me or does anyone else hear that \\"STAND BY ME\\" bass-line in the beginning of MERCY? It sounded so similar that I could have been fooled into thinking that MERCY took samples from that Ben E. King's classic or MERCY was a cover of that hit.

B000002GK1|4.0|First came out in 1991, looks to be Soundgarden's third record. Believe I caught them on this very tour as support band for Skid Row. Talk about an odd match. Their first CD with bassist Ben Sheppard. Even though I followed Soundgarden through out their entire existence, I hate to admit that I rarely pull out their music anymore to play at random. Tracks I'll always prefer off of 'Badmotorfinger' are the one-time Mtv late night favorite \\"Rusty Cage\\", \\"Outshined\\", the over-played \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\", \\"Searching With My Good Eye Closed\\" and \\"New Damage\\". Know I probably need to dig up my copy of their 'Ultramega OK' disc - that was my favorite Soundgarden title. A true grunge classic.
1904920233|5.0|While Wagamama restaraunts are mostly known to those who have been to London, this cookbook is made for an American audience.  They include cup and spoon measures, say shrimp instead of prawns, cillantro not corriander, snow peas not mange tout.  However, the DVD that comes with it is of minimal use if you have any experience with stir-fry and they use British words.  A great book for anyone wanting some slightly westernized Asian dishes, as well as those anglophiles longing for London. (Note: Not all the menu dishes are included.  My favorite, chicken katsu curry is not in the book).
B00003CXCW|5.0|I just watched \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" for the first time.  I absolutley loved it.  I usually stay away from \\"black and white\\" movies, considering they are not from my generation.  The only other old movies I've seen are \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", and parts of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\".  This one interested me because I work in the entertainment industry and I like movies about Hollywood.  \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" puts new movies to shame.  The acting and writing back then were so different.  This film was written so perfectly and beautifully. The scenes with Gloria Swanson were just what I like, bizarre and surreal.  The characters were unforgetable, especially Gloria Swanson.  She is my new hero, I absolutley loved her, she's my new favourite diva extrodinaire.  I loved this movie so much I stopped it half way through so I can watch the rest of it when I buy it.  It's on my new all time favourite films.
0007152590|5.0|This is among the best books that I have read on building loving male-female relationships. I gained valuable insights about men and women and this helped me to understand my moods and actions and those of my wife. I could clearly see myself being vividly described by the author. I can plainly make out where I need to change to become an understanding and caring husband without being as I always tended to be \\"Mr Fix-It\\" when my wife talks about problems or issues bothering her.<br /><br />I now appreciate the value of cherishing my wife to motivate her. I no longer get surprised when I hear women expressing their feelings through various superlatives, metaphors and generalizations. I now know that men and women communicate differently; they love, think, feel and perceive things differently as though they are from different planets. The book provides useful and helpful problem solving techniques that have greatly helped me in my relationships with women.<br /><br />I would like to thank John Gray for helping me to learn that my differences with my wife are normal and that the difficulties we have often experienced in our relationships have also been experienced by other couples and that these differences, when understood, help to cement strong and lasting relationships.<br /><br />I, therefore, highly recommend this classic which highlight strategies for reducing tensions in relationships and strengthening love through recognizing differences between men and women.
B00005ASGG|5.0|I remember seeing this when it came out, and haven't seen it in its entirety since.  It really brought me back to that time, when there were so many Westerns yet so few memorable ones.  This one really sticks in the mind, not only for the acting, but for the situation and its ideals.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart arrives as a young man determined to make his mark, but is brutalized by Lee Marvin.  He is rescued by a local heavy, a cynical but just John Wayne, who takes him to \\"his girl\\", the wonderfully subtle and beautiful actress Vera Miles.  I just loved these male characters, who are drawn together yet are also competitors, almost alternative futures of the West.  Wayne preaches armed resistance, Stewart a legal/political  one.  In a way, they trade places, as the West is won, generating a myth.  It is truly masterful and spellbinding, even moving.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  My kids will love this ancient film as sharing with us oldies.
B0006L89N8|5.0|This is among the best books that I have read on building loving male-female relationships. I gained valuable insights about men and women and this helped me to understand my moods and actions and those of my wife. I could clearly see myself being vividly described by the author. I can plainly make out where I need to change to become an understanding and caring husband without being as I always tended to be \\"Mr Fix-It\\" when my wife talks about problems or issues bothering her.<br /><br />I now appreciate the value of cherishing my wife to motivate her. I no longer get surprised when I hear women expressing their feelings through various superlatives, metaphors and generalizations. I now know that men and women communicate differently; they love, think, feel and perceive things differently as though they are from different planets. The book provides useful and helpful problem solving techniques that have greatly helped me in my relationships with women.<br /><br />I would like to thank John Gray for helping me to learn that my differences with my wife are normal and that the difficulties we have often experienced in our relationships have also been experienced by other couples and that these differences, when understood, help to cement strong and lasting relationships.<br /><br />I, therefore, highly recommend this classic which highlight strategies for reducing tensions in relationships and strengthening love through recognizing differences between men and women.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I love this CD! It's one of those that you can push play and just let it run all the way through. She's got a great voice and the CD is a nice mix of upbeat, bluesy, and mellow songs. A definite must-have if you like trying out new music.

B00005JPUN|5.0|_The Invasion_ (2007) is a modernized and updated film version of the classic 1954 science fiction novel by Jack Finney _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_, starring Nicole Kidman as Dr. Carol Bennell, a feminized version of the main character in Finney's novel.  Finney's novel has been previously adapted to film on several occasions and each time has attempted to make a comment on the given era (e.g. commenting on the communist menace, etc.); however, this version has been compared unfavorably to those other adaptations.  Nevertheless, I feel that this version has something worthwhile to say despite itself.  The film shows what happens when an extra-terrestrial disease invades the earth and turns the people of earth into emotionless zombies.  Nicole Kidman who is a divorced psychiatrist living in Washington, D.C. in the movie (perhaps a jab at Scientologist ex-husband Tom Cruise here!) must unravel the situation as she encounters patients who claim that certain of their relatives or associates are behaving oddly or are not themselves.  Together with her son (who turns out to be immune to the disease), Kidman must fend off the entire city, including her boyfriend who eventually succumbs to the disease.  As the film unravels the atmosphere of paranoia builds and Kidman who eventually becomes infected herself must keep awake, else she too will become an emotionless and mindless zombie.  In order to better blend in with the rest of the populace, Kidman adopts a posture of stoicism, thus suppressing all true emotion.  The atmosphere of parnaoia builds and at times one wonders whether the whole thing is rather not a schizophrenic delusion.  Ultimately there is a confrontation between the people as they now are and Kidman and her son.  Kidman must choose between the invading alien presence and her former life and here the movie has a comment to make.  While the invaders offer a more peaceful world, they ultimately have no room for her son among them (he being immune to the disease).  Thus, we see how in any collective there is always one who stands out and how such a person has no room in the collective.  So while the collective may be more \\"peaceful\\" in a sense, it also is crippling to the superior man or the one who stands out.  In this case, Kidman makes the right choice and ultimately restores the world to the way it was before.  Thus, her son is saved from the alien menace.
B000JLTR8G|5.0|I am really puzzled as to how i could have possibly overlooked such a classic movie all these years. After a long time, i have seen a movie that has really overwhelmed me like this one.<br /><br />The Yakuza tells the story of Harry Kilmer (Robert Mitchum) a PI, who goes to Tokyo to get back his friend Tanner's daughter from the Yakuza. The Yakuza had kidnapped the girl as a part of a financial deal gone wrong between Tanner and Tono Toshiro, one of the Yakuza oyabun(boss)<br />To do so, Harry instills the help of Tanaka Ken (played by the amazing Ken Takakura) , an ex-Yakuza, whose sister Eiko is loved by Harry, but due to certain circumstances Eiko cannot reciprocate his love to Harry and does not agree to marry him. The rest of the story involves a very heart wrenching plot twist and an ending that will leave you in tears. It explores in great detail, the interpretation of giri, what it means to the Japanese and what it should mean to people in general about a person making good on his debts.<br /><br />Whatever happened to movie making like this, i sometimes wonder. The fight/ sword action sequences are so believable and realistic, not this idiotic flying across the room and slashing a 100 villains etc..<br />I believe the best aspects of this movie are the unspoken emotions and facial expressions among the actors (Robert Mitchum, Ken Takakura) who deliver amazing performances, very well directed by Sydney Pollack.<br /><br />In my opinion, this movie should be added to your collection, as it is in mine. It is that good.<br /><br />Some of my fav scenes are<br />1. The opening scene, where the Yakuza Kato bends down and delivers his introduction to Tono and tells him, his position is higher, so Kato will to deliver his introduction first.<br /><br />2. The last scene, i cannot go into the details as it would be a potential spolier, but it really moved me to tears.
B000000WZ4|5.0|What can I say about Ultra that hasn't been said before? First off, just that DM recorded this album was an achievement in itself. I remember when I bought it back in 97 I was highly pessimistic that it wouldn't live up to past classics due to their recent problems and the departure of Alan Wilder (who I still miss!). Boy, was I wrong!    This album is simply stunning and I rate it as my third favorite DM album behind Black Celebration and Violator. I think Martin's writing here was really inspired from all of the stuff that was pulling the band apart. The opener Barrel of a Gun was like it was almost written for Dave as we know was still having drug issues. The other songs are just as strong if not stronger. It's No Good is probably in my top three favorite DM songs of all time and Home is arguably the greatest song that Martin has ever sung (right up there with Somebody).    Other standouts include Sister of Night and Useless. But the closer Insight is just about perfect. I love the ending as Martin sings a wonderful backing vocal. To date the band has never sung this live but i sure wish they would. It's very inspiring. And as the song says \\"you gotta give love.\\"
B000002KFJ|4.0|Black Sabbath's sixth studio album peaked at #28 which was the worst showing by the group. The album is better than that, in fact, Sabotage compares very well to their first five albums. It would be their next two albums, Technical Ecstasy & Never Say Die!, where the overall quality of the albums would take a nosedive.     \\"Am I Going Insane (Radio)\\" was the one that got the most airplay, it was certainly created to be radio-friendly, but, along with \\"The Writ\\", they are the weakest songs on the album. I didn't say they were bad songs, they're just not the same quality as the other songs on the album. \\"Hole in the Sky\\" was one of the best songs that Sabbath recorded. The short outro \\"Don't Start (Too Late)\\" follows, it's short at 49 seconds & it's good for what it is but I'm not sure what the point of it is. \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" is another very good song. \\"Megalomania\\" is the centerpiece of the album, it takes about three minutes to get to its dynamic sections but it's worth the wait. \\"Thrill of It All\\" is another good song that's followed by the instrumental \\"Supertzar\\". Some think this is the weakest song on Sabotage but the faux voice effects is one of its most unique aspects, particularly for Sabbath.    Eight songs on the album & not a one of them are bad. Tony Iommi once again comes equipped with an album full of guitar riffs. But Sabotage marked the end of the beginning of the Ozzy era of Black Sabbath. Their next two albums would be subpar efforts with an unhappy Ozzy making unhappy noises. Though Sabbath has never died (kind of like rock 'n' roll) they've never completely recovered from the departure of Ozzy. And to be honest about it, when Ozzy quit he took the heart of Sabbath with him.
B0010YSD7M|2.0|I am a fan of the series - I've seen every episode at least twice. I also liked the last two or three seasons. So I was very disappointed when this movie turned out to be quite boring. That is mostly due to the bad script and bad action sequences.
B000002GQE|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! On the heels of the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's came the Moody Blues Days of Future Passed. Days of Future of Passed hasn't aged quite as well as Sgt. Pepper's but this album had a concept that tied together much better than the other. Released in 1967 Days of Future Passed was the third Moody Blues studio album. This album had a new lineup that featured Justin Hayward (Lead guitar, vocals) & John Lodge (bass, vocals). Gone was Denny Laine who later be Paul McCartney & Wings rhythm guitarist. Another interesting fact about this album was it peaked at #3 on the charts in 1972, five years after it was originally released! The new & more talented version of the Moody Blues was ready to take off.    Two singles were released from the album; \\"Tuesday Afternoon (Forever Afternoon)\\" climbed to #24 on the charts in 1968. The most famous single \\"Nights in White Satin\\" went to #2 on the charts in 1972. It was belatedly released, the story behind it being a very interesting one. As legend would have it (I'm not able to actually verify this tale) a DJ located somewhere in the Northwest of the U.S.A. was working the night shift, he wanted to take an extended break (can you guess why?), so he checked his playlists to find the song that had the longest time length, he found \\"Nights in White Satin\\", supposedly a B-side at that time, & put it on. If we believe this tale then it's obvious that the song spread over the airwaves like a wildfire out of control until the label was forced to release it as an A-side & you know the rest of the story.    Actually only about half of the album is the Moody Blues. The other half belongs to the London Festival Orchestra which was an orchestra in name only, it didn't actually exist except for the recording of this album. Conductor/Arranger Peter Knight was the man behind this part of the album. Decca records actually wanted the Moodys to record Dvorak's \\"New World Symphony\\" in order to showcase the new sound technology they had developed. Of course, we know that didn't happen. The Moody Blues put their concept together & with the help of Peter Knight they would complete it. Knight was responsible for the orchestral sections, in most cases he scored the Moodys songs into orchestral arrangemnets using them os intros, outros & bridges between the songs. When Decca records got the finished product they didn't know what to do with it; it wasn't quite classical music nor was it quite pop music. They released it anyway (thank you) & though it didn't quite catch on initially, it would do so later.    The  songs \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" & \\"Nights in White Satin\\" are now considered classic & are the best on this album. They've dated better than the rest of the album because their music & arrangements are timeless; they're just as good now as they were back then. \\"Nights in White Satin\\" I would consider one of Rock's Top 100 songs. It's unfortunate that the rest of the album is more of a sign of the times, psychedelic & hippie-oriented lyrics being the cause. The rest of the proper Moody Blues songs are merely average. The marriage of rock to an orchestra was a good one though, in that sense, this a groundbreaking album. It deserves its recognition & status.     The additions of Hayward & Lodge improved the Moody Blues immensely, they went from being an ordinary R&B group to one of the leading psychedelic/pop bands in the world. None of these musicians (Justin Hayward, John Lodge, Mike Pinder, Ray Thomas, Graeme Edge) will ever be considered among the best at their respective instruments but, very much like the Beatles, the sum was greater than the parts.
B000007UZ8|4.0|First off, this review is based off the original, US/UK release. I haven't heard the bonus tracks, though I'd love to, but I want to rewrite my review and this is the first edition other than the regular one I saw. So... yeah.<br />Anyway, for the longest time I didn't like this very much. but I listened to it again recently, and something really clicked. It's not like it's a mind-blowing release like OK Computer or Kid A, but it is a pretty good album. Very solid, well-crafted alternative rock. Derivative? Oh, sure. Thom Yorke sounds exactly like Bono circa Boy, and most of it is nothing Nirvana or R.E.M. hadn't done better. Despite all that, it's just a flat-out good album with four exceptional songs.<br />\\"Creep\\" is, of course, one of them. I think it's still Radiohead's highest-charting hit, and while it sort of has a stigma attached to it among \\"hip\\" Radiohead fans, I think it's a solid self-loathing rock song with an innate sense of dynamics. Rather lame chorus aside, \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" is more or less as good, a bass-heavy, anti-establishment rocker with searing guitars and sneering vocals. \\"Stop Whispering\\" jangles like R.E.M. and has a great soaring chorus hook to make up for the lack of activity in the verses. And \\"Blow Out\\" is a spare, jazzy closer that gives way to nihilistic rock - a bit of individualism even during this early period.<br />The rest? Well, it's just good, that's all. The best of what's left is probably either \\"Ripcord\\" or \\"Vegetable\\", for no other reason that both songs groove along nicely and are guaranteed to leave you tapping your mouse. I get them mixed up, because they're quite similar, but I believe that \\"Ripcord\\" has an acoustic based track with occasional electric guitars blasting over it. I like it when bands do that. \\"You\\", \\"Prove Yourself\\" and \\"I Can't\\" are pretty catchy, and \\"Thinking About You\\" is a nice folksy diversion. Really, \\"Lurgee\\" and \\"How Do You?\\" are the two weakest songs on the album, but neither are bad. \\"Lurgee\\" is inoffensive, and \\"How Do You?\\" has a cool three-guitar buildup and an even cooler freaky guitar ending.<br />So it's good and solid. Not their best, but nobody said it had to be.noffensive, and \\"How Do You?\\" has a cool three-guitar buildup and an even cooler freaky guitar ending.  So it's good and solid.

0920236162|5.0|this is a fun and clever feminist take on the traditional fairy tale! while some have criticized the ending (elizabeth turns down ronald and goes off on her own), i think this is unfounded. princess elizabeth is very young, so the fact that she does not end up with ronald does not suggest to me that she ends up alone forever! while elizabeth does call ronald a \\"bum\\" at the end of the book which may be offensive to some parents, to me this seemed more like a comment on his character & lack of appreciation than gratuitous name-calling. i particularly like the fact that elizabeth outsmarts the dragon rather than harming or killing it. i have given this book to my nieces who love it.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|According to a NY Times article on 5/26/08, Warners is concerned at the soft sales of their movie \\"I Am Legend.\\" Warners might want to consider the fact that it is a rather average movie of little staying power. It did well in theaters, but few movie-goers would, I think, ever want to visit it a second time. That tacky, pseudo-happy ending (which totally subverted the wonderfully poetic meaning of the title in the original novel)is a primary reason for the film's lack of impact. Smith too is average: that seems to be a reason for his appeal, and I predict it will be a reason that he too will eventually lack staying power. The much-touted special effects are OK but not all that much better Science Fiction Channel.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|Somehow, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson can never get it right, and when he's combined with producer Scott Rudin (\\"The Addams Family Values\\"), the result is profoundly worse. Anderson's fetishist tendencies tend to prevent him from any real human understanding (call it \\"Quentin Tarantino Disease\\"). In this movie about an ambitious oil wildcatter, the audience is never given a reason to care about the main character, Daniel Plainview (histrionically played by Daniel Day-hyphenation), or to understand the roots of his unbridled ambition. He is evil, and so what? That he is contrasted with an equally unlikable evangelical preacher is totally without dramatic effect. If the oilman character is intended to be emblematic of mindless, ruthless capitalism, then \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is yet another boring morality play. Why not turn the same lens to Hollywood, where soulless accountants (Scott Rudin) produce \\"art\\" by investing in bankable comic book characters and movies by Anderson, whose deeply flawed works inevitably look cartoonish?

B00005BJC7|3.0|This album holds the dubious honor of being, other than their various EP's, the worst Radiohead release thus far. Of course, \\"worst Radiohead release\\" is a relative term, since they're my favorite band other than the Beatles, and most of their records are at least well-crafted and filled with mainly good songs (Pablo Honey, Hail to the Thief) if not brilliant (The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, In Rainbows). But this... this is a weird, confusing mess. Two of these songs are certainly among the best the group ever did - up there with the \\"Paranoid Android\\"'s, \\"Optimistic\\"'s, and \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\"' of Radiohead's world. Another four aren't as good, but are still great. And then the remaining five suck ruthlessly.<br />Good first. \\"Pyramid Song\\" just might be the best song in Radiohead's history, a spooky combination of simple piano, nightmarish synths, sound effects such as what sounds like an air-raid siren going off underwater and lingering vocals. Plus it has the best video the group ever did, so that's cool. \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" is great as well. It's blues-techno, with a fine riff and a driving beat behind it. I also quite enjoy \\"You and Whose Army?\\", which is at once defiant and defeated. But Thom's vocals are mixed so high they bleed through. Too high, in other words. And I like Thom's vocals, too. \\"Knives Out\\" isn't spectacular, but Thom's weird vocal twisting makes it good. \\"Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box\\" is simply a good techno song. Again, nothing to wet your pants over, but solid. And the drunken horn section on \\"Life in a Glasshouse\\" is so funny that I have to give it my endorsement.<br />So now... the noble failures, or else the just plain failures. I have to complement the group for creativity and ambition and on and on, but that doesn't make \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\" or \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" any better. In fact, \\"Pulk/Pull\\" might be the worst song Radiohead has done to date, though Hail to the Thief's \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" is terrible as well. \\"Dollars and Cents\\" sounds like it wants to be \\"Pyramid Song, pt. 2\\" with its crazy nightmare sound effects and strings (Yeah, there were strings in \\"Pyramid Song\\", but there's so much other cool stuff in \\"Pyramid Song\\" I forgot to mention them), but without all the awesomeness of \\"Pyramid Song\\" it's just a disjointed mess of crazy sound effects and strings. Woo-frickin'-hoo. \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\" is awful, as well. They took \\"Morning Bell\\" (one of the best songs off Kid A) and essentially screwed it up. Cool 5/4 beats? Gone. Catchy bass line? Gone. Awesome creepy seagull screech effects? Gone. In its place? An annoying bell that chimes every other beat and a celestial choir pad. The only good part is Thom's falsetto leaps during the chorus, but I can hear those on the original \\"Morning Bell\\". I'll stick to that, if you don't mind. Lastly, \\"Hunting Bears\\" is just boring. It's a moody guitar solo, and it's half the length of the similar \\"Treefingers\\" and still manages to be half as interesting. Boo. To make things even worse, \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\", \\"Dollars and Cents\\", \\"Hunting Bears\\" and \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" are lined up one after another during the record's second half (or side, as I stubbornly refer to them as), so it's by far the worst stretch of music in Radiohead history (in ANYONE'S history, for that matter). If this was released in 1971 instead of 2001, and I was alive back in 1971, I'd probably have a worn-out first side of this album and a second side that was close to pristine - \\"close to\\" because \\"Life in a Glasshouse\\" still does rule.<br />I wish I knew what to make of this, but that's sadly not the case.

B0018QCXGY|1.0|and is hired to film Cloverfield. In all seriousness, I understand the director wanting to record how he feels someone would react to a crisis while attempting to capture it all on the film, but he really should have assumed that this person, although probably slightly inebriated, could use the zoom button on the camcorder. To say this film was extremely hard to watch and, in a theater setting, nauseating is quite an understatement. I give it one star, instead of a zero, because it actually had a very promising story line and could very well have been a very good sci-fi movie given another director.
B000AAF1U4|4.0|Let me first admit: In general and principle, I hate Disney movies.<br /><br />There, I said it. I know as American consumers, we consider that blasphemy against the capitalist God that Disney is. They usually destroy any fairy tales they do get ahold of (The Little Princess in original form is NOT<br />a happy story with saccharin musical numbers), and in those cases, I would recommend avoiding them like the plague...or American Idol.<br /><br />So why am I writing this? Because sometimes, one in a so often, Disney gets their act together. The original Fantasia is easily one of the most amazing cinematic accomplishments of the early 20th century. They are a huge influence on the Japanese manga scene (you can go straight to Osamu Tezuka's \\"Astro Boy\\" for that\\". However, after Disney died, quality dropped off.<br /><br />They got a shot in the arm of invigoration with their deal in the 1990's with Pixar, and most of us know that story. However, they also ended up producing two films that were a bit outside their safety zone that were, in my view, surprisingly fresh: Lilo and Stitch and The Emperor's New Groove.<br /><br />With The Emperor's New Groove, Disney seemed to be completely hands off on the project. Besides the opening Tom Jones piece (which, by the way, is lounge-erific), there are no singing and dance numbers. I normally hate David Spade, but he's okay here. He does his \\"snotty little punk\\" act here of course, but the character calls for it, making him bearable. John Goodman as Pacha is an excellent foil, an average joe swept up into extraordinary situation, and Goodman's deadpan works great off Spade (see<br />\\"the waterfall scene\\" for an excellent example). Eartha Kitt plays a great villain here, Yzma, often made fun of for being \\"very, very, very old\\" and also has a wonderful wicked deadpan that works. However, the character that steals this movie, hands down, is Kronk, Yzma's manservant (played brilliantly by Patrick Warburton). I was out of breath laughing so hard at this character. He plays a dolt...who has a penchant for cooking and talking to squirrels. He is the icing on the cake of a script that is somewhat Monty Python-esque in it's absurdist humor, which had me hooked.<br /><br />I haven't seen either of the special editions, and normally I'm not a huge fan of the behind the scenes stuff unless it's a completely overwhelming film (think Lord of the Rings or Star Wars). However, if you are into absurdist humor from an unlikely source, I would recommend checking it out.plays a dolt...who has a penchant for cooking and talking to squirrels.

B0010YSD7M|3.0|Like most Stargate crap I could have written better if they just gave me a general plot line to follow.  Despite the poor writing and lack of engrossing plot twists, it was a predictable yet good movie.  Stargate usually delivers that average quality that gets a viewer to come back for 10 years strait.  Good job overall.

B000003N7F|5.0|I know that everyone has, at one point or another, opened a review with the words \\"arguably the greatest album ever\\" or \\"It changed my life\\" or something similar. I will be no different. This is certainly the best John Coltrane album, though there are plenty of competitors, and it might be the best jazz album ever. I'll stop short of \\"best album\\", because it would be impossible for me to go that far. In a way, it also changed my life, or at least the way I thought about music. Before I bought it, my musical tastes were mostly confined to classic rock. After I bought it, and the only reason I did was because I enjoyed the Greatest Hits album of his I owned (which at the time was one of my four or five jazz albums), it opened my mind to all kinds of music. Soon not just jazz but funk, R&B, blues alternative rock, and some reggae caught my attention, and began to assimilate themselves into my daily listening diet, so to speak. It is more or less solely responsible for making me realize just how much there is to music. More than the DJ's at your local classic rock station want you to believe, that's for sure.<br />So, how about the music? That's a good question. Like most of Trane's other dates recorded after he signed with Atlantic and began to make some of the best music known to mankind, the band is a quartet, this time consisting of Trane on tenor and soprano saxes plus McCoy Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on bass, and Elvin Jones on drums, a group better known as the \\"classic quartet\\". A little note on Tyner: he's a brilliant pianist, at least as good as Trane's previous cohort Tommy Flanagan, and maybe even better. It's a four-part suite devoted to God, and it's a gripping, emotional work of art.<br />The album grips you right from the first part, subtitled \\"Acknowledgment\\", where Trane unleashes a cascading sax solo. When this ends, Garrison states the brilliantly simple theme, and Trane forgets all about convention and swoops right in on a solo.

The title is also chanted almost religiously near the end. This blends seamlessly into \\"Resolution\\", which is brilliant as well. Trane's interest in Indian culture and religion is made rather obvious by the piece's melody, and McCoy Tyner's piano solo is even more impressive than Trane's, which is really saying something quite impressive.

That is, he ignores all conventions of melody, and just plays the meter of the poem, offering a preview of where his music was about to  go.

B0013FXWU6|5.0|Almost invariably, movies that garner a lot of hype get very polarized reviews; the same applies to this movie, as evidenced by it's rough inverse bell curve of ratings (a greater proportion of extremely bad or good ratings than middling ones than most movies usually receive).  Oftentimes, the much-hyped movies often deserve a lower rating than the hype merits.  However, this is not the case with \\"There Will Be Blood\\".     This film really does live up to the hype, and in some ways exceeds it.  I was astonished that there were so many 1- and 2- (and even 3) star ratings.  Many of the lower ratings complained that the plot was choppy, and that the main character was essentially bad the whole way through, and didn't change his nasty ways.  Others complained that the story was too moralistic (railing against the evil capitalist), or that it was incomprehensible.  It is none of those things, however.    Not all characters, even protagonists, are supposed to come to a change-of-heart, or even a shocking self-realization that they are bad and that their ways have hurt others.  In real life (as is so beautifully portrayed in this film), people don't always find the error of their ways.  However, Daniel Plainview does have inner struggles (contrary to the opinion of some reviewers) in trying to reconcile his actions and their effects on his own life, the life of his son, and his relationship with his son, even if they aren't a large focus of the film or are not loudly and colorfully proclaimed.  Ultimately, Daniel Plainview chooses (if that is the proper word), at the end of his struggle, to entirely shut himself off from others and from having any close or meaningful personal relationships; but this doesn't mean that the struggle wasn't there.      Furthermore, this film is not too choppy or abstract.  It follows through an all the main themes and problems of the film and the characters and comes to a satisfactory conclusion for each (whether good or bad for the charactersin question, or whether a traditional or non-traditional conclusion, is irrelevant).  This is *not* an art film or some random abstraction piece made by an artsy, purposively (or even unconsciously) abstruse screenwriter or director.  To say so implies that you have never seen a truly abstruse or incomprehensible film, such as the barely comprehensible (but interesting, yet in my opinion lesser) film \\"Pi\\".    \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is one of the finest works of cinema an American has put out in years, and while it is not the Second Coming of Christ for cinema, it certainly ranks as a pretty darn holy event.
0688156819|5.0|There isn't a whole lot to not like about this book.  While it is short, sometimes brevity is key to good storytelling.  Tim Burton's little comic strip style book perfectly captures readers with it's dark wit and laughable illustrations.  While this is and never could be considered good literature by any stretch of the imagination, it is never-the-less an entertaining read with a cast of colorless characters (most of the illustrations are in black in white) that will make you laugh out loud.  Any fan of Tim Burton or dark humor will enjoy this quick read!
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|The first time I heard this album, I was disappointed with it.<br /><br />The reason I thought this was more likely the main reason most people were surprised by this album: it's very different. I really wanted the old Portishead, the creepy noir soundscapes wafting in your head and the air like incense smoke.<br /><br />Then I realised: as a fellow musician, would I want to produce music from the same stencil over and over again? No, I would want to break that form, challenge myself and those who listen to my work. I had a new template to listen to the new album with.<br /><br />So I did it again...and the brilliance came through.<br /><br />If you're expecting the smokiness of \\"Roads\\" or \\"All Mine\\", you're not going to get it here. What you are getting here is an album moving away from samples and exchanging them for more unorthodox arrangements (the toms on \\"Silence\\", ukelele on \\"Deep Water\\", keyboard arpeggios on \\"The Rip\\"), but this works due to the talents of instrumentalists Geoff Barrow (also considered the architect of the band) and Adrian Utley (who finally gets his props as a third band member, not sideman as the contract they had through Dummy and their self-titled album stated).<br /><br />Is there an element of mystery here like the original albums? Most definitely. These songs still exist in a unique Portishead universe, swirling, drifting, quiet in nature. There are some differences that are also welcome. Beth Gibbon's vocals aren't as distorted as the first two albums, which is a step in a new and better direction for her (also, check out \\"Out of Season\\", her solo album). The instrumentation, as I mentioned before, makes a big difference on this album. I read an article where Barrow and Utley said that they were going into the making of this album staying away from the original Portishead cliches, and they did. \\"Silence\\" has quite an energy, almost rocking. \\"Hunter\\" uses chimes and an almost early sixities approach in ballad making. \\"The Rip\\" may be my favorite. For the first 2 minutes, it's just Gibbons, a guitar, and a theremin-like hum. Then, her voice is looped and a keyboard takes over the arpeggio the guitar was playing. There is also a video up for it, which I highly recommend. \\"We Carry On\\" seems to go on a small riff on what sounds like a harmonium, but it works well. \\"Machine Gun\\" uses drum pads with cold sounding industrial samples, but it carries the song like a march while Gibbon's vocals drift around it.<br /><br />The only problem I've with the album are the last three songs.I am having difficulty being captivated by them, but it just may take some time, or more listens like the second time through did for me. If you like Portishead, buy this album. It may be a challenge at first, but give it several listens and try expecting something new about the songs. I find after a while, this album gives both the first and second a run for their money.t's just Gibbons, a guitar, and a theremin-like hum.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|This is the ultimate collection for the Blade Runner fan...  All 5 versions of the film, all presented in 1080p (though not all restored to the same standard: \\"The Final Cut\\" is stunning while the \\"Work Print\\" looks like, well, a work in progress.)  Plus, some 8 hours of special features in SD (480i/p.)  The collection is presented on 3 Blu-Ray discs (discs 1, 3, & 5) containing the feature films and 2 DVDs (discs 2 & 4) containing most of the special features.  Each version of the films contains a brief introduction by Ridley Scott explaining it's significance.  Any fan of the film will get many hours of entertainment from this collection, as well as the priveledge of experiencing one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time in a whole new way.  For the price, this can't be beat.
0199267170|1.0|Lack of glossary or footnotes, as well as scant (one-page) introduction to each play make this compilation more suited to the Shakespeare veteran than to the casual or even novice reader. I regret not checking out The Pelican Complete Shakespeare before buying this.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this DVD because even though I work out every day for a little over an hour, it was more like zoning-out.  That having been said, even for a more Intermediate-Advanced exerciser like myself, it is VERY high impact.  If you're nursing some injuries, even old ones, this may not be for you.  I know that after jumping up-and-down for 20 minutes straight my ancient hip injury started to bother me again.  Truthfully, I will probably only do this workout when I don't have time for a trip to the gym.  But I find her encouraging remarks and approach to exercise useful and will apply it to my regular workout.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|I had no inkling that this film would be as outstanding as it was. I figured it was just another pop release along the lines of the lackluster \\"We Own the Night.\\" I was totally wrong though and could not stop watching once it started. I'd put it right up there with The Departed, but below masterpieces such as The Godfather and Goodfellas. No matter where you place it, American Gangster touches on a seldom discussed topic in the history of crime and is riveting. If you haven't seen Across 110th Street it really adds to this film's appeal. Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe were magnificent and I was pleased to see Chiwetel Ejiofor in the cast. I loved \\"Dirty Pretty Things\\" and he gave an amazing performance as Okwe. Josh Brolin's Detective Trupo was haunting. I know, of course, of his dad and step-mom but was not familiar with him beforehand. Overall, American Gangster is a must see.
B000002KHH|4.0|This album was played at almost all (of a certain kind of) parties when I was in high-school. The shear power is what is noteworthy on this album. Legend has it that it was made by a bunch of working class kids from Birmingham that didn't know any better. It isn't sophisticated, but is powerful, with a drummer that was rumored to strike through the skins of the drums he hit them so hard, and some great guitar solo's as well as the Oz himself. Included is the Heavy Metal song so good it even made it to AM pop radio when it came out, \\"Iron Man\\", but it is just one of a whole album full of great songs. If I was still of that age and culture, I would rate this a full five stars, but I am kind of old to listen to much BS these days.<br /><br />So here's the deal, if you want a great example of Hard Rock of the 70's this is a great place to look.
0575079797|5.0|A very good start.  I was sucked in and swept away from the beginning, which is what I am always looking for in a good book.  Some of the most interesting and well written characters that I've read in a long time. Great dialog, good descriptions, understated humor.  At places, Abercrombie writes with very sophisticated wit that makes me smile to myself.    The main (editorial) review on the amazon page made a little too much of there being a lot of torture and violence -- it certainly didn't feel that way to me....  You are, however, constantly being reminded of past violence, since one character was horribly hurt and disfigured and crippled by torture.  And so you feel it every time the character appears.  He has to cope with it every moment of his life, and you, the reader have to as well.  It was something that I've never read before and has stuck with me well after I have finished the book.     One thing is missing, however.....  A map of the world would have been useful.  At several points, I was tempted to sketch one out myself -- just to position myself and figure out the lay of the land....    I have just started #2 and love, love, love the feeling of discovering a new voice with unread books in my future.    As other people have noted -- Abercrombie is similar to Songs of Ice and Fire (though on a smaller scale).  I would also place these books alongside Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series and Jaqueline Carey's Kushiel books.  This is not to say that Abercrombie copies or anything like that --- just that The Blade Itself resonates with me like those of the authors I just mentioned.

B0010V4TZU|5.0|I don't consciously try to follow new music but am luckily sometimes accidentally exposed to it. That's what happened with Vampire Weekend. I was at the gym and heard \\"A-Punk\\" which I liked immediately. I went up to the counter and looked at the Sirius station. I wrote down the name of the band and downloaded the CD after seeing a few of their videos online. Overall, I'm extremely impressed. The album glides euphorically and features some truly beautiful highlights. My favorite songs are the aforementioned \\"A-Punk\\" along with \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" and \\"Walcott.\\" The latter includes what I believe are mandolins and the sound is exquisite. This release has far more highs than lows. It's a consistent, strong album and I eagerly await their future work.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|John Adams is a curmudgeon whom U.S. history has rarely given its due. Adams was present and active in all the major episodes of early America and was as hard a worker as any, save Alexander Hamilton. I was not hugely impressed with [[ASIN:141657588X John Adams]], but as an HBO miniseries it does just fine. The historical skeleton is accurate, however some hard-headed history buffs will decry the dramatization. Of course, HBO always intended to present John Adams as entertainment, it is not a documentary and ought not be treated as such.<br /><br />The tone of the film is dark, Adams has a habit of taking everything a bit too seriously. The wardrobe of the period is limited to various shades or brown, black, gray and white. Though there are seven parts to the series, only a single episode is devoted to the Adams presidency. The miniseries is at its very best in the final episode, when a series of tragedies befalls Adams.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti does a phenomenal job representing the personality of the second U.S. president. Laura Linney plays his wife Abigail and Tom Wilkinson has moments of greatness as Benjamin Franklin. All three won Emmys, and the series itself set a record for the most awards in a single year. Though the series pacing dragged at times, it is worth watching if for no other reason than to understand that the founders of this nation were not the God-men history has created, but rather just men.
0446402389|5.0|I read the reviews and went to the bookstore to see if I'd like it. There were some style comments that concerned me in some of the reviews. I sat down and read 169 pages at the store. This is a great action mystery. There are acouple of suspend belief moments towards the middle to make the plot work --but if you like Russia, mysteries, and action this book is the real deal. Well written with lots of drive to the conclusion. Highly recommended.
1594200823|5.0|This easy to read book says it all. Having worked in agriculture for over 30 years I thought that I knew a great deal about the subject matter. But this exceptionally well written treat opened up new areas for me. I loved taking a rest and reading it.
B000SXOGW2|5.0|I admit that I apprehensively purchased this cd, not expecting much more than a BITW wannabe. Was I ever wrong. This album is a union of tremendous music and intellectual art. The poetry of Roger and musicianship of the boys blended together seamlessly. The sound effects, classical and WW2 inspired music are mixed in a delicious drink for the senses; as good as any Floyd album. EVER. Much more coherent than The Wall. Blasphemy, you say. Beter music than DSOTM? Yes. A+
B00005JO9J|5.0|This show is one of my favorite TV shows, and I only started watching it in the last week! It has such a great story line and wonderful characters. I have spent my fair share of time in hospitals, and it is so cool to see a TV show that can be so entertaining and yet fairly accurate at the same time. I was disappointed that there were only 9 episodes to the first season, but they are so wonderful that it makes up for it! Anyone who enjoys an intellectual and serious TV show will love Grey's Anatomy.
0143038419|5.0|I think this book makes a good read for anyone trying to understand spirituality. I especially liked the portion about her stay in the Ashram. I have been trying meditation for sometime now and can relate back to her experience of having constant background thoughts. Also I have been in silence retreats during which I have experienced stillness the author writes about. All, in all a good read. Thanks.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|The title of my rating says it all. What a waste of a good story line. What was the director thinking. The hand held shake an rattle of the cinematography made us all dizzy. It could have been a great movie but it wasn't due to very very poor camera use. Skip this one, or watch it in strobe motion if you have that feature, otherwise take lots of dramamine and have a vomit bucket near by. Ug, this is useless director and producer effort.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|As a fifty-something, I have been a lover of great music for a while.I lived and loved as a part of the disco generation.I closed down many a club nite out dancing to \\"Last Dance\\". \\"Bad Girls\\" with it's infectious beat streamed from my boombox. Fade to black.  Donna Summers(circa 2008) hasn't lost a thing. Like most of us fifty-something,there's a little more of her to love.She is still as vibrant and beautiful as ever.Her voice is flawless. She is a testament to careful living.  This cd is unbelievable. Somebody help me because I can't stop listening to it! Mr.Music is my least favorite and I give it a 9 out of 10.As other reviewers have said, it is an eclectic grouping of melodies.\\" I'm a fire\\" is the \\"Bad Girls\\"of 2008.It is a club burner! This album appeals across generational,cultural and sexual lines. It is the best cd of 2008,bar none.Hey, I'm saying this and the year isn't half over.This album is a reflection of  the wonderful caring, person Donna Summers has always been.  With all the crap out here labeling itself as music,shouldn't a truly phenomenal album be singled out. This is that album! I hope this is a commercial and critical success for Donna and her collaboraters. BUY THIS CD NOW!!!
B0018CWEYY|4.0|I loved this season and cannot wait to buy it.  However, I just have to say that I think it is absolutely ridiculous that season 4 has about 12 less episodes than the other seasons due to the writer's stike, but it still costs the same amount.  Does anyone else think that is a total rip-off!
B000Y7U98C|3.0|Summary:    An entertaining pop-sci-fi story with a touch of horror is benefitted by great production quality including sound, music, and graphics.  While the story is really interesting, it's heavily damaged by it's lack of realism.      Why I love this movie:    1. Story:  Very entertaining pop-sci-fi story.  The backstory to this movie is a really interesting near-apocalyptic sci-fi story.  The present story through the movie however has a more pop feel, dealing with issues like human relations and reactions to space travel and a dire mission.  There's a touch of horror thrown in there too.  The combinations of sci-fi and horror is very entertaining.    2. Sublime:  \\"Sublime\\" is a term for the feeling of combined amazement and fear experienced when humankind contrasts it's strength to the might of nature.  One example would be experiencing a ferocious waterfall first-hand.  The artistic message in this movie very much captures this feeling towards our own Sun.  Very cool.    3. Sounds:  Realistic.  Sound effects and ambience match the movie action well.    4. Music:  Fits the themes in the movie well, only adding to the movie's strength.    5. Graphics:  Great and realistic!  Parallels the best graphical animation out there today - movies like Transformers.  Though there isn't a whole lot of graphical animation, what there is is very well done and very realistic.      Why I hate this movie:    1. Realism:    (1a) In terms of present physics theories, this movie is absolutely impossible.  But, this doesn't matter too much.  I expected fiction.    (1b) What I cared more about was the behavior of the characters.  They act like they're on MTV's \\"Real World,\\" not like they're actual scientists who went to college.  Once you understand the premise of the movie, it just becomes ridiculous why these characters were chosen for their job.  (1c) There is a moment where the technology in the movie is lacking something VERY obvious to prevent what happens in the movie.  Dumb.2. Confusing:  In core plot moments I was thoroughly confused.  This is due largely to poor directing.  I had to have it explained to me by someone who watched it multiple times.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|CLOVERFIELD is one of those movies you think could become a cult smash or a video store reliable; it is not one of those that will quietly fade away.  You probably know the conceit of the movie-- a \\"goodbye reel\\" shot for a farewell party becomes a documentary on New York suffering a genuine Godzilla event. It keeps everything grounded and ground-level, in the very best sense, as the small (and dwindling) group of characters struggle not to beat the monster but simply to survive.  On the big screen, the action is vertiginous (my friend had to leave after about 20 minutes, because the videocam shooting technique was making her queasy). This is less pronounced on the video, though, which is a good thing.  There are lots of surprises and shocks, but keep your eye out for two small bits in particular-- the shot at Coney Island at the very end, and a vocal bit after the credits stop rolling.  CLOVERFIELD is likely to spawn a number of lesser imitations but this one is a keeper.

1582701709|5.0|I thought The Secret was excellent. However, it did not explain why individuals were unable to successfully accomplish their goals other than stating that they focused on what they did not want. I partially agree, but there is a DVD that explains why people sabotage their success. It is titled Change Your Thinking, Change Your Life. It explains how the physical body can sabotage your success and how the hemisperes of the brain participate in this sabotage. I believe The Secret and Change Your Thinking, Change Your Life will give you a more complete understanding about the sabotage phenomenon.
B00123AYNM|5.0|...but so glad I made it! This album is wonderful! A lucky chance happening of hearing \\"blackest eyes\\" on a cable music station hooked me in. I had to find this song and own it, and I found an entire album of music that speaks to me.     I find each and every song great in it;'s own way, and each being very diverse from one another. I am a huge fan of what I call \\"haunting, etheral rock\\" and this album fits that sound that I love.     For anyone who is a fan of music in the style of Pink Floyd, an alterative rock style with a sound all it's own, then take a listen to this album!!!
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|Hearing Donna Summer's name will evoke recognition of songs such as '70s disco classics \\"Bad Girls\\" and \\"Last Dance,\\" and, to a lesser extent, genre- and decade-transcending hits such as \\"She Works Hard for the Money\\" and \\"This Time I Know It's for Real.\\" Additionally, the Queen of Disco will instantly be respected for her contributions to dance music, but rarely for any other efforts outside of her '70s stardom. That may change with her attempt at the contemporary, Crayons.    For her first studio album since the 1991's Mistaken Identity, Summer treks into territory unexpected of her, yet embraces modern electronica elements that are her bread and butter, for a compilation that could easily see its singles play next to many of today's top hits. \\"Stamp Your Feet,\\" the opening track, appropriately fuses trance-y atmospherics with drumline-driven chanting into a party-starter that can't decide if it should be played in a hip-hop or dance club, but never has indecisiveness been such ear candy.    \\"Mr. Music\\" is a modern version of Indeep's \\"Last Night A DJ Saved My Life,\\" only this time around Summer personifies and celebrates her love for music rather than thanking the man who spins it. The set's title track features a guest appearance by Ziggy Marley and displays a hybrid reggae/club record that hasn't been heard since Max-A-Million's hits, \\"Fat Boy\\" and \\"Sexual Healing.\\" The G-funk-like piano and bass line on \\"The Queen is Back\\" may confuse listeners as to whether or not Dr. Dre had a hand in its production, but the anthemic cut reminds listeners of Summer's longevity and her importance in the industry with evidence that none of Dre's proteges can yet boast.    The ubiquitous T-Pain -- surprisingly -- does not make an appearance on the album, but a sound-alike makes his ever-present voice effects heard on \\"Science of Love,\\" a track that convincingly dips into Summer's rock side. Somewhat melodically similar to Janet Jackson's \\"Rock with U\\" yet full of acoustics, \\"I'm a Fire,\\" the album's lead single, showcases the more powerhouse side of Summer's vocals that are making the circuit-friendly track a hit in clubs around the world. Replacing synthesizers for acoustics, \\"Sands on My Feet\\" is Summer's somewhat raspy contribution to the \\"urban guitar\\" jams that have filled airwaves recently in the form of Chris Brown's \\"With You\\" and Beyonce's \\"Irreplaceable.\\"    Summer gets real country on \\"Slide Over Backwards,\\" another raspy-voiced cut that would effortlessly win over Macy Gray. For an empowerment ballad, look no further than \\"Be Myself Again,\\" in which she opens up to the vulnerabilities of being liked as someone else, rather than being hated as herself.    Summer has indeed added some new hues to her repertoire and the result is a disc of unexpected treats. Though there are some moments where it's hard to buy Summer getting contemporary with her material, there are many more in which the uninitiated could easily confuse her with her competition on the radio -- most of whom were probably born after Summer was crowned the Queen of Disco.

B0019UGYK0|5.0|This is a new Deluxe Edition of Cool Hand Luke, with new special features.  There will be a making-of featurette called \\"A Natural-Born World-Shaker: Making Cool Hand Luke,\\" which the press release describes as \\"an in-depth look at the creation of an uncompromising classic.\\"  There will also be an audio commentary with Paul Newman biographer Eric Lax, and the theatrical trailer.  Only the theatrical trailer and some text production notes are on the old DVD.  There will also be a Blu-ray version.<br /><br />Cool Hand Luke is the story of a man (Newman) who, by a minor offense combined with stubborn if at times casually guided will, gets himself into increasingly deep trouble in a tough Southern prison.  It's played as part comedy, part gritty drama.  Luke's cool, fearless, devil-may-care attitude and escapades make him an icon among his fellow prisoners, until he is brought to abject desperation, ultimately rising again and falling to become a legend.<br /><br />The film is famous for a hard-boiled egg eating contest and, especially, a quote that has entered the pantheon of movie quotes: \\"What we have here is a failure to communicate.\\"  The title character's nickname comes from another quote, made after he bluffs to win at poker: \\"sometimes nothin' can be a real cool hand,\\" a quote that has ironic punch in the context of the movie as a whole.  Newman was nominated for an Oscar, and George Kennedy won one for his supporting role.  Strother Martin is unforgettable as the twisted prison captain.<br /><br />I enjoy this movie, but I've never completely loved it the way many do.  Parts of it never seemed quite real to me (not \\"uncompromising\\" either), not with the truthful feel the similarly themed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has, for example.  But it is a classic, with memorable characters, scenes, and storyline.  I'd probably give it four or four and a half stars, but I'll round up for the new special features, which I look forward to.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition is [[ASIN:B0017TYPIG here]].

Even kids who don't enjoy reading will enjoy this book.    The humor is a bit edgy for my 3rd Graders and would probably be a little more appropriate for 4th and above. There is a lot of sarcasm that would be missed by a struggling reader, but I am sure they would still enjoy the loose story.
0446677450|5.0|I really enjoyed the book \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\".  It was a new way of looking at money for me.  This book narrated by Robert Kiyosaki tells the story of Robert's real father and his best friends dad.   His real dad, \\"poor dad\\", worked for his money, while his \\"rich dad\\" had his money work for him.    Kiyosaki explains even a person with a lot of money in the bank can be poor, though they have financial wealth in the bank, they are still poor mentally as now they are afraid they are going to lose all their money.    I loved that Kiyosaki says  \\"It's not what you make, it's what you keep\\"  If you make $100K and spend $125k you are poor.  \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" teaches you to act like, be like and think like a Rich person instead of a poor person.    Another transformational book I really enjoyed was [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]]  by Ariel & Shya Kane. It is a book of short stories that are inspirational.
B00005NTJK|5.0|While I believe that 'Benefit' IS the best of all Jethro Tull albums, it is extremely misleading to shoppers looking for positive reviews and suggestions of what to buy to call it a HEAVY METAL album or JETHRO TULL a HEAVY METAL band.    The band's roots were in BLUES and they were initially a Blues/Rock band. 'Benefit' itself is a transitional album. It is a brilliant mix of blues, rock and some folk and even jazz influences that would become more important for the band, particularly after 'Aqualung'. But it is NOT, in any way, HEAVY METAL.    If you are looking for a top-quality album, certainly one that belongs in anyone's collection, check this out. If you are only looking for an addition to a Heavy Metal collection---don't bother.
B000P0J074|5.0|Beetlejuice is coming back to DVD in a newly remastered 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, in both standard definition and Blu-ray, on September 16th, 2008.  The extras announced so far are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series (\\"Skeletons in the Closet,\\" \\"Spooky Boo-tique,\\" \\"A-Ha!\\"), and for the Blu-ray version an exclusive CD soundtrack sampler.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but don't count on it.  The new Blu-ray will be 1080p video, but the specs for the sound haven't been announced.<br /><br />Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's \\"Banana Boat Song\\" (\\"Day-O\\"), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />If you don't have the old, not-so-great DVD, the new release might be worth waiting for.  Amazon has a page to pre-order the new standard DVD [[ASIN:B001AGXEAG here]].  The Blu-ray version has a pre-order page [[ASIN:B001AGXEA6 here]].
B0013KTGAG|4.0|Visual effects were pretty well crafted. This movie did not have the usual \\"big name\\" actors (big deal). So if you are one of those losers who are looking for overpaid actors or some deeper meaning of life to be revealed through a sci fi movie then don't watch it. Or if you are the type who will over analyze a movie instead of accepting it for what it is (A MOVIE...... NOT THE PATH TO INTELLECTUAL EUPHORIA) then find something else to watch. If your desire is a simple enjoyable movie with decent effects and a plot twist here and there, then its worth the 1 hour and 48 minutes.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|Yes, ladies and gentlemen.  The infamous film, Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom, has been reissued by Criterion in a special 2 disc edition.  Criterion initally put out this DVD when they were still doing laserdiscs and DVD simaltaneously (its DVD spine number was 17), and the original DVD was pretty much barebones and not a particularly good transfer of the film (on either the laserdisc version or the DVD version).  Now it's being released in a deluxe edition.  What about the film itself?  Is it worth picking up?  Is it truly disturbing?  Is it a work of art?  Yes, yes, and yes.<br /><br />Pasolini made this film in 1975 right after his \\"trilogy of life\\" films, which included The Decameron, The Cantebury Tales, and Arabian Nights (aka Thousand and One Nights).  Those films were very joyful and playful, and did quite well at the box office.  Pasolini went into a deep depression afterwards, feeling that all his films were bogus and compromised, and set out to make a film, as he called it, \\"undigestable\\".  Salo was that film.<br /><br />It is based on the Marquis de Sade's book, which was written in 1789 but not published until 1935.  De Sade's book, while interesting at first, soon becomes boring and repetitive, outlining one sexual abberation after another.  It's not erotic, in fact, it's quite disgusting, as most of the sexual behavior concentrates on coprophilia.  Pasolini's film is much better than the novel, as Pasolini had much more to say with his film.  He changed the original setting from 18th century France to the last days of Mussolini's government, which had set up shop in Salo, an actual province in Italy.  Four fascists round up 8 teenage boys and 8 teenage girls, haul them off to a secluded villa, and degrade them and themselves for the duration.  Pasolini here used the novel as a exploration of consumer culture, fascism, communism, perversion, torture (many of the scenes in this film have an eerie similarity to the Abu Ghrab prison photos taken a few years ago), and absolute power.  Pasolini had said \\"he wanted to make a film without hope\\", and he did.  Pasolini expounded upon de Sade's ideas and made a startling film, one that has immense power, even today.  Pasolini was murdered shortly after completing this film in murky and still controversial circumstances, and somehow, that contributes to the bleakness and opppressiveness of the film.<br /><br />The film is as cruel, nasty, controversial, and bleak as you've heard.  It totally lives up to its reputation.  It has graphic scene of sexuality (despite abundant nudity, the film isn't erotic at all, but cold and numb), torture (the final third is entitled the circle of blood), and coprophilia (the middle third is entitled the circle of s***).  But it isn't an exploitation film at all.  It was made with the best crew in Italy at the time.  The film was shot by Tonino Delli Colli, who shot Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns.  It was produced by Alberto Grimaldi, who also produced Leone's spaghetti westerns and Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris.  Ennio Morricone scored it, Danilo Donati did the costumes, and Nino Bargali edited it.  It was a legitamite production, and there was quite a lot of press surrounding it at the time of its release, as Pasolini was a huge name in Italy and international cinema at the time.  Finding the film in its uncut form has been notoriously difficult over the years.  It's been banned in many countries (it's still banned in Australia today), and even the DVD editions aren't complete.  The original Criterion version and this version have omitted a scene where one of the fascists reads a poem from Gottfried Benn, which was included in the British Film Institute version.  This 25 second scene has been posted on Criterion's website, and having seen it, it doesn't really add anything to the film.  For all intended purposes, the version we have here is Pasolini's final cut.<br /><br />I saw this recently in an extraordinarily sharp print in NYC, and the patrons in the theater didn't say a word.  Some left. Most of them stayed, and were truly stunned afterwards.  Some tried to laugh this film off at the beginning; by the end of the film, they weren't laughing.  They couldn't.  This film was made in 1975, and it still has the power to shake you to the core.<br /><br />The DVD transfer is superb.  It's as good as the print I saw at the IFC Theater.  The extras are quite extraordinary, especially the documentary Salo: Yesterday and Today.  It includes actual footage of Pasolini shooting the final scenes of the film (the torture scenes), and it's actually very difficult to watch this behind the scenes footage.  Even though one may think it gives you a sense of relief that \\"it was all a movie\\", it doesn't.  The footage (which is in grainy black and white, 16mm footage) has a power all its own.  There is another documentary called Fade to Black in which Bernardo Bertolucci and Catherine Breillat talk about Salo.  Bertolucci's thoughts on the film are particularly striking and poignant, as he was great friends with Pasolini as well as an artistic colloborator.  The DVD box has one of the most chilling covers in Criterion history, including a sinister close up on the inside, which is astonishingly creepy.  It also contains a 90 page booklet with fascinating essays by the great, brilliant filmmaker Catherine Breillat (who thinks Salo is a masterpiece) and Gary Indiana (who wrote a very well known book about the film).  The only thing about this DVD edition that I object to is the fact that Criterion did not include John Powers's excellent essay on the film, which was printed on the laserdisc edition of the film.  He said two things about this masterwork that are brilliantly insightful...<br /><br />\\"It's the cruelest, most obscene, and most intellectually toxic work ever made by a major director.  Once seen, it is forever remembered.\\"<br /><br />\\"At a time when movies are routinely called \\"shocking\\" and \\"contro-<br />versial\\", Salo not only lives up to these words but makes them feel childishly inadequate\\".<br /><br />It is one of the most disturbing films ever made, on line with Cannibal Holocaust, Ichi the Killer, In a Glass Cage, and Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.

0786838655|5.0|This is totally the best book ever. Beautifully written, deep, thoughtful, I can't think of all the words to describe it. Good for the entire family. If you like this book (which EVERYBODY should) read the next books in the series (these are in order): The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, and The Battle of the Labyrinth. There's going to be five books total. As much as I love Harry Potter books, Rick Riordan's current four beat J.K. Rowling's seven any day!
1594200106|5.0|Ruiz Zafon's novel tells the story of Daniel Sempere who grows up in post-Civil War Barcelona.  The city is scarred by the war (bullet holes still mark building facades), and the lives of everyone in the city are affected by what took place during the Spanish Civil War (1936-39).  Reading this novel, one can easily look at one side of it and think of it solely as the story of Daniel searching for information about Julian Carax, the author of a mysterious novel.  However, as I read this book I saw a deeper significance and made another connection.<br /><br />Ruiz Zafon published this novel in 2001, at a time when Spaniards were looking back at their own past and breaking the \\"pact of silence\\" that was made during the transition to democracy in the 70s.  It was a huge bestseller in Spain (and, interestingly, in Germany), as it told the story of the modern Spanish experience since the end of the Civil War.  It is an allegory for all that has happened since 1936, and the characters represent different segments of the Spanish population.<br /><br />Think of Daniel as the modern Spaniard, who is searching for meaning in the past and for an understanding of that past.  Think of Mr. Sempere and Nuria Monfort as the generation of Spaniards that remembers the Civil War and its effects and who wants to forget.  Think of Fumero and Fermin as the opposing sides during the Civil War--each responsible for atrocities.  Think of Clara as the political parties that promised change and help but gave none.  And most importantly, think of Julian Carax as Spain itself, scarred and devastated, and desperate to eliminate himself from history by destroying any evidence that he existed.<br /><br />Barcelona itself is a character in the story--an angry, hurt and brooding woman (as Ruiz Zafon describes it), but one that watches over Daniel in his quest for truth and understanding.  Consider also Ruiz Zafon's use of light and dark imagery.  Here he takes a cue from Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" and reverses the roles of black and white.  The darkest places are the safest, while white and light represent betrayal and danger.  (An interesting note: Julian Carax's cat is named Kurtz, the name of the doomed capitain in \\"Heart of Darkness\\").<br /><br />These are just some thoughts that have come my way as a student of Spanish and modern Spanish history.  If you have read this book, read it again or flip through it again and consider the possibility of it being an allegory, and perhaps you'll notice something interesting.  If you have not read the book, keep an open mind to both aspects of the story: the effect of Julian's book on Daniel's life, and the broader associations with Spain's recent past.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy it, and I would love to read your comments!  This is just a theory I've come up with, so I'm totally open to opinions and feedback.roles of black and white.

B00005JPO1|5.0|Like the other great classic heroes of the 80's, Indiana Jones makes an awesome comeback! I thought the movie was really good and had the classic look of the 1950's! It was cool that the Ark from the original had a brief appearance! It was also awesome to see Marion from 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK' back and helping Indy against Russians who are after the Crystal Skull. Shia LaBeouf does an awesome job as a greaser named Mutt Williams who is Marion's son that helps Indy on his journey too. There are some jokes about Indy's age throughout the film which is pretty funny! If you are a big INDIANA JONES fan, then you'll love INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL!!!!<br /><br />P.S. I hope they do make Indy 5!
6305308659|5.0|1998's Pleasantville is a charmingly executed parable about introducing change to a closed society, and the ripple effect that even the smallest changes can produce. Siblings David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) are polar opposites; nerdy David is obsessed with the ficticious 1950s sitcom Pleasantville (an homage to Leave It To Beaver and other picture-perfect small-screen families), while Jennifer hangs out with the fast crowd, smoking and snaring potential dates.<br /><br />After a mysterious TV repairman (Don Knotts) gives the two a remote, they're transported into the black-and-white, picture-perfect town of Pleasantville, where the basketball team makes perfect baskets every shot and a nutritious dinner is always on the table (thanks, mom!). Horrified, the two at first try to desperately find a way back. David has the advantage of being intimately familiar with the Pleasantville universe, and tries to steer Jennifer away from any seismic outbursts that would be out of place in placid Pleasantville, such as swearing, smoking, and heaven forbid, s-e-x. Jennifer has her own agenda, though, and Lovers Lane soon becomes more than just a place to stargaze and hold hands. With each change comes the slow but sure colorization: first bubblegum turns pink, then the more \\"adventurous\\" teens end up in color.<br /><br />David and Jennifer's \\"parents,\\" George (William H. Macy) and Betty (Joan Allen) Parker, are stamped straight out of 1950s legend; George begins every evening by announcing \\"honey, I'm home!\\" and Betty's always on call to whip up massive breakfasts or hors d'oeuvres. David, now \\"Bud,\\" works in the burger joint owned by Bill (Jeff Daniels), who's paralyzed by indecision and any break in routine. But a funny thing happens; the once-wild Jennifer slowly becomes more scholarly and more and more like her TV counterpart than her former \\"bad girl\\" self, while once-timid David learns to stand up for himself and to fight for what he believes in.<br /><br />In Pleasantville, the old guard is threatened by all of the changes: the once-empty books in the library are filled, Bill realizes his life's dream of becoming a painter, using every shade under the sun, rockabilly and rock and roll are heard...resulting in violence and trials that parallel McCarthyism. Betty and other wives begin to yearn for a fulfilling life outside of the home, leaving their husbands hungry and confused.<br /><br />Although the visual metaphors are heavy-handed at times, Pleasantville does an admirable job at capturing the balance between modern uncertainties (at school, the teens are given sobering statistics about AIDS, global warming, and underemployment) and our rose-tinted nostalgia for the past. The visual design deserves special mention, and the classic soundtrack is loaded with gems by Pat Boone, Miles Davis, Etta James, Elvis and Buddy Holly. Pleasantville was nominated for two dozen awards, and it's easy to see why. A delightful film for the entire family.le, the old guard is threatened by all of the changes: the once-empty books in the library are filled, Bill realizes his life's dream of becoming a painter, using every shade under the sun, rockabilly and rock and roll are heard...resulting in violence and trials that parallel McCarthyism.

0385512058|5.0|This is one of the few books I've read that actually contains advice and tips that I use every day. I once heard \\"Never Eat Alone\\" referred to as \\"How To Win Friends And Influence People\\", but updated for the 21st century. I'd say that's pretty accurate. Here are some of the things I liked about it.    *Keith Focuses on the mindset behind building relationships before he gets into the how-to. Namely, that you should focus your relationship building on helping other people succeed, instead of seeing them as stepping stones in your own success. AFTER you've helped other people get what they want, they'll be more open to helping you.    *He explains who the \\"Connectors\\" are, and the immense value that they can have to you in building your social network.    *He gives examples of things you can do to get close to powerful figures and how you can leverage their knowlede, expertise and contacts to help support you in your cause, while you support them in theirs.    Like some of the other reviewers, I found the constant references to Ferazzi-Greenlight a little annoying, but you know what? For the immense practical value and usability of the information Keith Ferazzi shares in this book (if you actually apply it), I think a little..okay, a LOT of self-promotion is overlook-able, lol.

0143038583|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read lately.  Somewhere between an expose, history lesson, and memoir, the book provokes many thoughts as to where his past and future meals come from and their effects on the world.

Particularly pertinent at this time of increased ethanol production and consumption, that section is equally informative in explaining how we are awash in a big government subsidized tidal wave of corn.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|OMG I love this movie. It's one of my very favorite movies with one of my very favorite movie actors. Mr. Johnny Depp. Even though the movie has a stellar cast and even though it has a great story that's very funny and entertaining and even though Johnny Depp was the star of it, I never knew of this movie until very recently. Isn't that something.     \\"Cry-Baby\\" was directed by g-a-y-as-a-goose director John Waters. John Waters' a genius because he knows how to mix just the right amount of satire, comedy, music and dramatics in each of his movies. IMHO \\"Cry-Baby\\" is his very best.     This is the main cast:   Johnny Depp ~ the coolest guy in the entire universe ~ Cry-Baby Walker   Amy Locane ~ otherwise known as Sandy Louise Harling to only her closest friends ~ Allison Vernon-Williams   Ms. Polly Bergen ~ Granny Vernon-Williams   Susan Tyrrell ~ Ramona Rickettes   Kim McGuire ~ Hatchet-Face   Ricki Lake ~ Pepper Walker   Traci Lords ~ Wanda Woodward     Johnny Depp was so adorable as Cry-Baby. He was like Jimmy Dean, Marlon Brando, Jason Priestley, Luke Perry and Jake Hanson all rolled up into a nice little package. I loved his character because as soon as you think he was serious all of a sudden he acted totally screwballish. And, that's how the entire movie was.     Generally, I do not watch musicals, but the songs in this were very good. My favorite was the last song that Cry-Baby \\"sang.\\" He had his guitar and looked just like Ricky Nelson. So cute. The style of singing reminded me of something I'd hear at a Joe's Crab Shack. It was fast and fun and didn't have much rhyme or reason.     There were also so many funny parts. Ramona Rickettes (Pepper & Cry-Baby's granny) was just too much. She remined me of one of those old biker-babes who are just in this life to have a good time. Maybe that's because that's exactly what/who she was? Ricki Lake was hilarious. She looked like an elephant in a black leather coat who was in her 10th trimester. (Incidentally, isn't the name Pepper so laughable? It so sounds like a dog's name.) I also loved Hatchet-Face because she had a face that could bring a smile to anyone (picture a cross between Bea Arthur, Cyndi Lauper & Cindy Brady.) And I really liked the part with Traci Lords hitching a ride; and all of a sudden that weirdo from the beach pulls up.     Amy Locane was perfectly cast as the sweet and timid Allison. Wasn't she so incredibly attracted to Cry-Baby Walker? (Well, you know what they say, it's that forbidden fruit that tastes the sweetest.) The makeover that Pepper & Wanda gave her was sorta lame though. I pictured her in something much more far-out; like a pair of those \\"hysterectomy pants\\" that Ramona Rickettes had on.     I also really enjoyed Ms. Polly Bergen (who's in one of my favorite movies from the 60's, \\"The Caretakers.\\") Her facial expressions and mannerisms were totally conducive to the prudish granny that she was playing. And it was so funny because all of a sudden she was for the Drapes. I didn't understand exactly how or why that sudden transformation occurred but with all screwballs the basic plot doesn't need to be understood.     My favorite part was when Cry-Baby and Allison kissed. To borrow the words of the brilliant businesswoman, Paris Hilton: that's hot. Johnny Depp's tongue looked absolutely delicious. And, you know what they say about cry babies with big tongues. I also liked how Cry-Baby's pants (conveniently) fell down as he was escaping from jail and his shirt also tore open to reveal Johnny's hot bod.     I really don't think Cry-Baby was anywhere close to being as evil as he tried to make others believe. He was just a misunderstood boy. He was just like Dorothy

B0014Z4ON4|4.0|The second instalment of the original 80's Indiana Jones trilogy returns with much of the bang an whollop of it's predecessor, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. The superb opening, a musical number \\"Anything Goes\\" in the Shanghi club Obi-Wan is a great way to roll the opening credits and it leads into a spectacular set-piece, involving Chinese gang lords, a ditzy 30's night club dancer (Kate Capshaw) and some valuable ancestral \\"treasure.\\"    All this sets us up for a thrilling ride that sees Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) make his way to India, with two tag along helpers, his whip and trusty fedora to aid a village who has suffered at the hands of an infamous cult, bent on mining the area for the sacred and powerful Shankara stones.    Along the way, there are numerous dangers the protagonists must face (none of which I'll reveal here!), in a series of wonderful action packed set-pieces.    I must say though, I'm at a loss as to why people count this as the worst film in the original Indy trilogy. While it certainly is not as good as the incredible 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', it's absolutely light years ahead of the incredibly stupid and tired 'Last Crusade'.    This film does do away with some of the more light hearted moments from \\"Raiders\\" and the jaw-droppingly stupid attempts at humour in 'Last Crusade' and is certainly a darker film, but to me that's a good thing. There's nothing wrong with a little injection of seriousness into a rip-roaring adventure movie. In fact, as I age, I appreciate the film more and more, while subsequently feeling more and more distance from the third film in the series.     Apart from the abandonment of over the top stupid humour, gone also are the nazi badguys from 'Raiders' to be replaced by the Thuggee cult. A fictitious version of an actual 18th / 19th Century Indian cult, also called Thuggee, who practiced robbery and murder of travellers during the Raj.    The Thuggees here, of course, are as about as realistic as the portrayal of theGermans in 'Raiders' and 'Last Crusade' or the Russians in 'Crystal Skull' and serve only as a foil for Jones. But they do it well and their leader \\"Mola Ram\\" is menacingly played by Amrish Lal Puri and is the best of the Indy bad guys.    I understand that some people may not like the darker tone of the piece, but there's nothing here that is \\"disturbing\\" or \\"horrific\\" as some people have suggested, in fact, I'd say the ending of 'Raiders' is far more \\"disturbing\\" than anything on show in 'Temple of Doom'. In anyway I find it remarkable that anyone (adult or child) could be \\"disturbed\\" by an Indiana Jones movie. I first saw this when I was 10 and loved every second of it.     'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' is a fitting sequel to the brilliant 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', it retains the fantastic set pieces, violence, magic, incredible stunts, wit and charm that the first movie had, with some good performances from the people concerned and adds a few new things into the mix as well.    Unmissable for fans of the first film and for fans of cinema in general.

B00006ZXSK|1.0|This movie is not even close to the original Cinderella. Being rife with with feminism, Utopianism, class struggle and even some situational ethics, I felt that I was being given a political lecture rather than being entertained.   Cinderella, in this version, rescued the prince and herself, certainly a departure from the origninal story. The prince was uncertain if he wanted to marry Cinderella because of her class.  The gypsy-robbers were portrayed as being honorable while the prince apologized for his lack of honor.  The scenery was pretty at times, but overall it looked low-budget, especially the scenes from the ball.  The characters were miscast and boring except for Angelica Huston who played the role of the stepmother well. I don't know how this movie got 5 stars as it has virtually no redeeming features.

B000YAA68C|3.0|I love Gerard Butler, and can't stand Hilary Swank. So when I became interested in the plot of the movie, I made the mistake I always seem to make (basically insuring I will hate the film). I went to the library and got the book. The book was phenomenal. I read it in one sitting. I laughed. I cried. I loved it. But I couldn't picture Kathy Bates as the mother of Holly. Nor could I understand how good the film could be without Holly's brothers, or father. If you enjoy the film, please, please read the book. You may appreciate the story much more fully if you do. The story is a beautiful story. One of a fairytale love few ever find but that all (men and women both) would love to experience.

0743298039|3.0|Diane Setterfield's first novel is an uneven, but still worthy, tale.  I haven't read too much 'gothic' fiction, although I enjoyed the frequently-mentioned 'Jane Eyre' and 'Rebecca', and the similarities to those stories probably made feel more comfortable with this one.  The premise, setting, and atmosphere are all good, but, despite some fleeting moments of strong characterization and 'spookiness', the book falls short of the classic, 'rave review' status some here have given it.  Like most of the 3-star reviewers, I had some problems warming up to  many of the characters. The deliberately vague time period, and the characters' overly formal, 'stuffy' attitudes and stilted dialogue, hark back to nineteenth-century novels, but it seems jarring to think that this book could take place in more or less 'modern' times. I see the setting as somewhere in the early 50s, but I doubt it could be much later than that.  I agree that it's a bit misleading to consider this a 'mystery' story, though it's not advertised as such anywhere on the cover or in the reviews inside the book. As a 'gothic drama', it's entertaining enough, but both Margaret and Diane could use a good editor!   The story is slow-moving in more than a few places, although, in my opinion, it comes nowhere close to the dry, overwrought, pretentious and coma-inducing prose of 'Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell', which more than a few unfavorable reviews have mentioned as a comparison.  The issue of 'twin-ness' is not explored as thoroughly as I thought it might be, and I agree with the reviewer who said that 'twins' are used as a sort of Hitchcock-esque 'McGuffin' for the purposes of the plot. Neither Vida's nor Margaret's 'twin' issues are resolved as well as they might have been.  Setterfield's biggest problem may have been that she crowded too much activity among too many interesting characters, many of whom probably could have carried their own stories, rather than being supporting players here. Isabelle, Charlie, and Aurelius are particularly intriguing, but I felt more could have been done with them, and less with the 'tricks and twists'.  Considering this is a first novel for Setterfield, I'll give her something of a benefit of a doubt, and give this book a better rating than I might have if it had come from an established writer. I wouldn't rule out reading another of Setterfield's books. Since she seems interested in contemporary as well as 'gothic'/historical fiction, maybe she could do more with a different setting, and a less derivative story.

B000E41MRC|4.0|This is one of the true masterpieces of propaganda and an outstanding example of cinematic manipulation.  Leni Reifenstahl created a truly impressive record of the Nazi Party Congress in 1934 and preserved it for the world to watch for generations to come.  It is fascinating to note, with the benefit of hindsight, how much is left unsaid but lurks menacingly below the surface.  But what is said is rather mundane and adheres to the party line, which makes modern audiences wonder what all the cheering and \\"seig heils\\" were about.  The film is subtitled so you can read all the words of the speeches and you may be surprised by how lame they sound today. It is with a knowledge of history that one can take this all in and appreciate what a tremendous sales job this film did for Adolph Hitler and his government.  This edition of the film helps you out with an historical commentary track which will help people, especially younger audiences, understand why what they are watching had such a tremendous impact.  It is fun to watch Reifenstahl's cameras rolling to capture every angle of the impressive procedures...the Nazi's were masters at staging massive events.  Look for the camera mounted on a flag pole in the stadium and moving up and down to capture the scope of the ceremonies.  Some of the speeches were staged for the camera and you can sometimes pick out where the material was intercut.  Propaganda is rarily so effective and this masterwork is well worth watching if you are a student of history and the terrible period of World War II.  I know that a warning to take this entire production and its moving images in context is not necessary but it is wise to keep in mind while you watch this film that this was a dangerous government building its power.  These days we are used to a mass media assault by politicians but this was very new in 1934.  Well worth watching, it also created and refined a standard for filming live events of this type.  Reifenstahl spent the rest of her life being praised for her dramatic technique and apologizing for this work.  She did several other films for the Nazi Party including the wonderful \\"Olympia\\", which contains somewhat less propaganda because the Americans won so many gold medals.r life being praised for her dramatic technique and apologizing for this work.

B00005JPNZ|4.0|After twenty seven years since the Raiders of the Last Ark introduced the  archeologist and adventurer Henry \\"Indiana\\" Jones who divides his time between teaching the University students in a quiet auditorium and saving the world in the incredible dangerous and breathtaking adventures, and after nineteen years since his quest for Holy Grail in the Last Crusade, Indiana Jones is back - with his fedora, leather jacket, whip, grin, fear for snakes, and the new big adventure, spectacular, fast-paced, silly, funny, and  jaw-dropping at the same time. Believe it or not, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) is the first IJ movie that I've seen at the theater. They were not released in the former USSR (that's probably why, Spielberg and Lucas made their bad guys Russians this time:)) and I saw the trilogy first in the end of the 1980s when the videotapes became available. The new movie is full of adventures, has not one but three fallings down of waterfalls and the huge attacking red ants. As in all Indy movies, there is a long and spectacular signature chase sequence, this time a multi-vehicle chase through the jungle with the heroes jumping on the full speed from one car to another, two characters engaged in the sword fight standing on the parallel moving jeeps, the Crystal Scull of the title falling back and forth from the good guys to the bad ones. The \\"baddest guy\\" here is the girl played by Cate Blanchette wearing the uniform not unlike Dr. Evil's and the black wig a-la Louise Brooks of \\"Pandora's Box\\" or Uma Thurman of \\"Pulp Fiction\\". She plays a Russian villainess, Dr. Irina Spalko, the lead researcher of psychic phenomenon and the supernatural.  Blanchette is as good as ever proving that she can play successfully any role, including the one that requires a lot of physical actions. The fourth movie takes place in the different time than the first three, and it is set against the realities of the 50s: the beginning of cold war, the double agents, the talks about UFOs and aliens. One of the scenes, as remarkable as it is memorable, depicts a ground-level nuclear test in Nevada on the picturesque town that was built only to be destroyed after the drop of atomic bomb.<br /><br />The movie is beautiful - no surprise here, Janusz Kaminski, usual Spielberg's \\"partner in crime\\" was DOP for it. I just realized that it was the first Indiana Jones movie for Kaminski - the first three were shot by David Slocombe. I liked the story and the acting by Ford. At 65, he is perhaps one of very few actors who could bring back to life beloved character and the years would not have power over him. I like a lot John Hurt as Professor 'Ox' Oxley - equally comical and moving as the scientist who was able to talk to the mysterious Crystal Skull and who kept the keys to its secrets. I am always glad to see Ray Winstone and Jim Broadbent on the screen. No matter what nay-sayers think of it, I like the latest Indiana Jones movie and I was glad to see that \\"for an old guy\\", Dr. Jones is still good in a fight.the talks about UFOs and aliens.

B000B8L6LI|5.0|I've owned the Lansky system for almost 20 years and they perform perfectly and enable me to get fantastically sharp knives every time with a modicum of elbow grease but without any actual skill.  Lansky's system is a brilliant arrangement of a knife clamp with sets of holes that ensure consistent grinding angle for the stones that have long steel guides.  This solves the problem of how to hold the stone to the knife at a consistent angle.  Using stones to sharpen your knives gives you total control and allows you to achieve the finest edge (much finer than using a chef's choice, motorized bench grinder (which can overheat the blade ruining the temper), or any of those ceramic wheel/rod dohickeys).  The available angle choices are 17 degrees (for Asian knives), 20 and 25 (for Western knives) and 30 degrees (for hatchets).  Lansky offers various different stones (from natural Arkansas stones, to diamond abrasive).  This particular set includes 3 synthetic stones - coarse, medium, and fine.  The stones are of good quality.  The fine is fine enough to get your blades shaving sharp.  The coarse one cuts quickly, but will be the first stone to wear out.  They also give you a bottle of sharpening oil to help carry away the metal shavings to keep the stones cutting.  I don't like using oil so I keep a wet paper towel handy when sharpening and wipe the metal off the stones and blade periodically while sharpening that that works fine for me.<br /><br />To use the Lansky the process is simple - clamp the blade into the clamp - then scrub the blade against the stone with a consistent angle until you feel a burr (a thin raised seam) along the edge. The burr is your cue to flip the blade over and do the other side. When you get burr on the other side, move onto the next stone. By the time you get to the final fine grade polishing stone and get burr on the last side, then flip and give slight touch with the stone on the other side (to remove the burr but not raise another one) and you'll find your knife is literally shaving sharp (will cut the hairs off your arm).<br /><br />Is Lansky the perfect sharpening system?  For medium and small knives it probably is.  Knives over 6\\"-7\\" long, however, require you to sharpen 1/2 the knife and then move the clamp and sharpen the other half because the edge angle changes too much if you attempt to sharpen too far from the guide hole.  The stones themselves are pretty small (about as wide as your middle finger and as long as your hand) so it can take a long time to do a big knife.  I can do a 5\\" utility knife in about 5-10 minutes, but an 8\\" Chef's knife can take more than double that - which starts to become a bit of a big project.  If you do a lot of big knives you'll probably want to spring for an Edge Pro Apex (same mechanical concept, bigger size for much much more money).  If you only periodically sharpen then this can be lived with.  You shouldn't sharpen your knives more than once or twice a year (or they wear out too quickly) since sharpening removes metal.  You should use a honing steel frequently in between sharpenings to keep your knives sharp.<br /><br />Lansky's system is the best way for normal regular people (non fanatics) to sharpen their knives.  It's pretty easy, fun, satisfying, and extremely effective.find your knife is literally shaving sharp (will cut the hairs off your arm).    Is Lansky the perfect sharpening system?

I don't like unknown, vague endings.  There were some interesting ideas and two plot twists, but I didn't enjoy the book enough to recommend it.  I wanted it to be over.  The author spends a lot of time describing flowers and details.

This book gives you the realistic version of Stalinist Russia. Citizens can be sent to Gulags or the Lubayanka for expressing  pro western saying,possessing western books, or disloyalty toward the Soviet Union.    The hero in this book is Leo Demidov. He works for MGB the state security force. He is a true believer in the Soviet style. He lives in comfort and his parents live in comfort because of his position. There is  a serial killer on the loose in Russia. His victims are children. Their stomachs are removed and their mouths are filled with dirt. The state  refuses to acknowledge the existance of a serial killer in their country.  Leo tries to investigate the killer but is demoted from MGB and transferred to another posting. He still tries to investigate the killer and is arrested. After a stunning escape he continues to pursue the serial killer. He discovers a deep dark secret and the identity of the killer is shocking.     This is an outstanding book that you should take time to read. Its is  definitely a winner.

Though the book deals with some advanced topics, the way the material is presented makes it easier to get into your brain.    My suggestion is to pick up one of these books in a book store, skim through it to get the idea of where they're coming from, then buy the book from Amazon. (It's cheaper.)    They use  a lot of graphic characters, conversations amongst characters, crossword puzzles, etc.   It's not just a text book but a way to learn new  technical material.

B000002JSP|5.0|English hard rockers Led Zeppelin released their eighth and final studio album In Through the Out Door in August of 1979.<br />The album was the band's first album in over THREE YEARS (which, by 1979 standards, was a long wait) since the March, 1976 release of the chart-topping Presence.<br />Alot happened in the three years, disco became huge whilst punk and new wave were happening underground and arena rock and hard rock/metal bands like KISS, Foreigner, Styx and Ted Nugent were keeping rock alive in the mainstream here in the States. In Zeppelin land, tragedies struck in 1977. First, manager Peter Grant was going through a divorce. Guitarist Jimmy Page began having drug problems. Then in July, Grant, drummer John Bonham and two other members of Zep's entourage were arrested for beating a security officer. Then, lead singer Robert Plant's young son Karac had died suddenly from a stomach infection therefore curtailing Zep's US tour.<br />The band went into an uncertain period where Page and Bonham were dealing with demons and Plant was still grieving whilst bass player John Paul Jones (who was unscathed in the disasters) retired to his family. Then, the band went to Sweden in November, 1978 to start work on ITTOD which would be the last album Zep would release as an active band. For the album, a revitalized Plant (whom was about to become a dad again as son Logan would be born during ITTOD's mixing sessions in January of 1979) and Jones were the album's musical forces while Page did co-write many of the songs and produced the album despite his heroin troubles and Bonham played well considering his alcohol intake. Would this album be another Zep classic or would it be a dud, read on and find out (as I did when I first got this album on cassette in November of 1985 when I was 9).<br />All of the tracks were penned by Page/Plant/Jones except as noted.<br />The opening \\"In The Evening\\" is a killer opener. Droning synthesizers, violin bowed guitars and tympani's start this track. After the intro, it becomes a classic rocker, featuring some fine guitar work by Page and Bonzo's killer drumming. Next is \\"South Bound Suarez\\", a bluesy shuffle rocker with some great piano work from Jonesy. Next is the album's US Top 30 hit \\"Fool In The Rain\\". This track got the most airplay on rock radio when released and the band used Caribbean flavorings in this track's middle section to a great extent. The first side ended with the English doing a classic original hoedown track called \\"Hot Dog\\" written by Page and Plant. Page's country-ish picking riff and Plant's Elvis-type vocal delivery make this track a standout.<br />The album's second side kicked off with the almost 11 minute epic Carouselambra. Jonesy's synthesizer intro morphs into a fall out rocker with some great guitar playing by Pagey (he used his Gibson doubleneck on this track). The track rocks out then slows a bit then picks up the pace and the song is just stellar. The next track is \\"All My Love\\" (written by Jones and Plant). Plant wrote the song after his first son Karac's death and was a great tribute to him. Jonesy's keyboards on the track were superb and Page's guitar work here is beautiful. The closing \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" is a great album closer. The synthesizer intro is beautiful before turning into a classic blues featuring great bluesy vocals from Plant, and some marvelous interplay between the bass guitar and drums. Page's guitar solo is blues at its finest. The song ends with some passioned singing and screaming from Plant and the crescendo to the end was amazing.<br />When ITTOD was finally released (with a paper bag concealing one of the six different album sleeves), disco was on its way out and New Wave went back underground (for awhile) as the album became the first album in history for a ROCK BAND to debut at #1 on Billboard's Album Charts in late August of 1979 and stayed for eight weeks and sold a stellar 3 million copies in its first five days according to Atlantic Records (the band's US distributor).

B000063Y8F|2.0|This product is BEAUTIFUL and well-designed.  Unfortunately, the cool tension feature that keeps the handles closed broke within 3 uses.  Then, less than 2 months later, the whole thing just snapped and bent into a completely unusable shape while routinely pressing garlic!  I'm so so disappointed!!  I have contacted Amazon customer support and will see how they respond to this issue.  I read p curran's review before I purchased but thought that he/she was in the minority and just been sent a lemon.  Apparently, they make plenty of lemons to go around!

B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zeppelin's sixth album Physical Graffiti was released in February of 1975(coincidentally the same month my older brother was born).<br />By 1975, Led Zeppelin was the biggest rock band in the world only rivaled by The Who, The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd.<br />After the Houses of the Holy tour ended in 1973, Led Zeppelin formed their own record label Swan Song in conjunction with Atlantic Records and took a break.<br />In 1974, lead singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bass player/keyboard player John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham returned to Headley Grange (where Led Zeppelin III and IV were recorded) and began work on Physical Graffiti which was comprised of freshly new written material plus outtakes from their previous five albums. Would the result be a masterpiece or a waste, read ahead and find out (as I did when I first got the album on cassette tape on January 9, 1986 and eventually acquired the remastered CD).<br />We begin with the classic rocker \\"Custard Pie\\" which wasn't an ode to pastry baking but you get the picture. Page's riff here just kicked *ss and Plant sings about seducing a woman while getting her away from her folks. Next is another great rocker \\"The Rover\\". The track was a holdover from the Houses of the Holy sessions but a great song. Page and Bonham are on fire here. Plant's vocals on this track are superb. We then come to the longest song in the Zep repertoire called \\"In My Time Of Dying\\". The epic was inspired from a Bob Dylan song of the same name. The piece is led by some excellent slide guitar from Pagey with Plant's aching vocals, Jonesy's hypnotic bass and Bonzo's maniacal drumming.<br />The second side of the album kicks off with \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" which was an outtake from the album of the same name. This track is an upbeat pop influenced rocker that features some superb playing by the band. The album's only US Top 40 hit \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" (penned by Jones/Plant/Page) is next and is a funky number that sounds reminiscent to The Crunge from 1973's Houses Of The Holy as well as Stevie Wonder's classic Superstition. Jonesy's clavinet and Page's riff drives the track. The last song on the first disc and the second side of the original album is the eight and a half minute piece \\"Kashmir\\". This piece has a guitar riff that sounds Middle Eastern as it was written by Page/Plant/Bonham. Page's guitar work meshes perfectly with Bonham's heavy handed drumming to create the perfect atmosphere for the lyrics, which detail Page and Plant's travels to Morocco. This is one of rock's greatest epics. What Puff Daddy did to this track in 1998 was blasphemy to the enth degree.<br />The album's second disc and third side opens with the atmospheric Page/Jones/Plant epic \\"In The Light\\" which features superb keyboard work from Jonesy, guitar work from Page and vocals from Percy. The Led Zeppelin III outtake \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\" is next and a great simple instrumental which was used in the Zep movie The Song Remains the Same a year after the track was released. Next is another Zeppelin III outtake \\"Down By The Seaside\\" which is upbeat and great use of electric piano and Leslie speaker drenched electric guitar. The third side ends with \\"Ten Years Gone\\" which is a bluesy reflection on life and mortality and a great piece.<br />The album's fourth side opens with a Zeppelin IV outtake \\"Night Flight\\" which is stripped own Zeppelin with just drums, bass, vocals and guitar plus an overdubbed organ part. This song has lyrics to it. Next is the Page/Plant rocker \\"The Wanton Song\\" which is another great Zeppelin rockerabout a rather bedeviling woman with Plant singing in a phased voice with excellent guitar work by Page. Next is a cover of the Ritchie Valens classic \\"Ooh My Head\\" dubbed \\"Boogie With Stu\\" which was a jam between Zeppelin and Rolling Stones' unofficial sixth member Ian Stewart (the \\"Stu\\" in the title). Next is another Houses of the Holy outtake \\"Black Country Woman\\" which is an acoustic number andfeatures great harmonica work by Plant. We end the album with the rocker \\"Sick Again\\" which is a sign of things to come with the hard rockers they would record on their next album, 1976's Presence. Page's riff and Plant's lyrics are on fire here. Pagey uses great regular lead work and slide work on this track.<br />Physical Graffiti became Led Zeppelin's fourth US chart topper hitting #1 on the Billboard album chart after its release and to date has sold an astonishing 17 million copies in the US alone.<br />The remastering on this CD is astonishing!<br />RECOMMENDED!ica work by Plant.

1423101464|5.0|This is book four of the Percy Jackson series, with only one more installment to come.  Readers from around ten years old will be thrilled by the adventures of the teenaged hero who just happens to be the son of Poseidon, God of the Sea, and all his friends, most of whom are the children of the Olympians from Greek Mythology.<br /><br />In my opinion, it would be better if you read the series in order, and the three previous books are:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0786838655 The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 1)]]<br />[[ASIN:0786856866 The Sea of Monsters (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 2)]]<br />[[ASIN:1423101480 The Titan's Curse (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 3)]]<br /><br />In \\"The Battle of the Labyrinth\\", Percy and three friends set off on a quest through the treacherous labyrinth, in search of the inventor Daedalus, hoping that he will help them to defeat the army being assembled by Luke, son of Hermes.  The thing is - Luke is just the messenger, and the evil he's about to unleash can bring down Olympus itself.<br /><br />Although still clueless about girls and relationships, Percy starts developing and unleashing his powers, and surprises even himself when he attempts to repeat Hercules' great stable cleansing project.  Other demi-gods also come into their own in book four, and a mortal girl proves to be just the ticket, and in the nick of time too.  In a related sub-story, the search for Pan reaches an exhilarating climax.<br /><br />Packed with monsters of all persuasions, gods and demi-gods, rescues, battles and side trips to Alcatraz and Mount St. Helens, this is by far the most exciting book of the series so far.<br /><br />Amazingly imaginative, thrilling and funny, this series by Rick Riordan continues to be a front runner in children's fiction, and I recommend it without reservation.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, May 25, 2008
B000002JSJ|5.0|English hard rock legends Led Zeppelin's seventh studio album Presence was released in March of 1976.<br />Presence is the band's most overlooked album, languishing in the monstrous shadow of its SIX predecessors (their 1969 self titled debut to 1975's Physical Graffiti) and to a lesser degree 1979's In Through the Out Door as far as sales stats go but this album saw Zeppelin rock out like not ever before nor since.<br />The Presence album is mostly remembered in the band's history for the circumstances in which it was recorded, in double-quick time as lead singer Robert Plant still had his leg in a cast after being involved in a near-fatal car accident in Greece with his wife and children in August, 1975 (this was the first of several tragedies that would mark the end for the group). The short span of time it took to record Presence (three weeks (which many bands like The Rolling Stones at the time would use to record one track)) doesn't show as Plant, guitarist/producer Jimmy Page, bass player John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham perform like men literally set on fire on this great album, as I found out when I first got this album on cassette in November of 1985 from my mother (may she Rest In Peace).<br />The 10-minute plus opening \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" is one of the best songs the band ever recorded with a myriad of Page guitar overdubs and solos plus Robert's vocals all being superb despite the fact he recorded every vocal track on this album in a wheelchair and Bonzo playing his drums like a crazed madman firing a machine gun and Jonesy's 8-stringed bass guitar work sounding like a herd of elephants were unleashed. \\"For Your Life\\" follows and is a great rocker about the evils of drugs with Pagey doing a superb Fender Stratocaster solo (the first of two tracks on the album where he used a Strat the other being Hots On For Nowhere). The funky rocker \\"Royal Orleans\\" closes the first half about a humorous tale about the band's misadventures of touring in New Orleans.<br />The second half kicks off with the album's other classic \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" which was an old Blind Willie Johnson blues regenerated with heavy guitars by Page and manic drumming by Bonzo plus phased vocals and killer harmonica solo from Plant and monstrous bass work from Jonesy. The Top 40 hit \\"Candy Store Rock\\" follows and is a great song with an Elvis Presley vibe to Plant's vocal though many don't like it for reasons I fail to see (in fact, this is the only track with some rhythm acoustic guitar added as an overdub which you can clearly hear on the remaster). The song \\"Hot's On For Nowhere\\" follows and is a great shuffle and was, I believe, the only Zep song to utter an obscenity on the track and was the second track where Pagey used a Strat for the solo (the rest of the album he used his famous Gibson Les Paul). The closing nine plus minute bluesy epic \\"Tea For One\\" closes this album on a bluesy, somber note and seems like a part two of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" after staring out drum beat wise for a few seconds like a \\"Kashmir\\" sequel but Robert's voice was not in screaming mode this time around (unlike Since I've Been Loving You) and this song is a classic Zep blues track.<br />The Presence album upon its release was another hit for the band hitting #1 in no time flat here in the US and was the band's first Platinum seller (eventually 3 million copies sold in the US total) here in the US although many fairweather fans and critics loathe this album for reasons I don't understand but I LOVE IT!!!!<br />Highly recommended!The second half kicks off with the album's other classic \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" which was an old Blind Willie Johnson blues regenerated with heavy guitars by Page and manic drumming by Bonzo plus phased vocals and killer harmonica solo from Plant and monstrous bass work from Jonesy.

B0012X6FT4|5.0|Elvis Costello's second album, \\"This Year's Model\\" has received the re-release treatment before, most recently in 2001, but this truly must be regarded as the ultimate 30th anniversary deluxe reissue treatment.<br /><br />CD1 (23 tracks, 70 min.) first brings the original album, and what a delight it remains 30 years later. It almost sounds like a greatest hits album in and of its own, with classics like \\"Pump It Up\\", \\"(I Don't Wanna Go to) Chelsea\\" and \\"Radio Radio\\", but the non-single tracks just sounds as good in retrospect (such as \\"No Action\\", \\"You Belong To Me\\", etc.). There are 10 bonus tracks, including delightful b-sides like \\"Big Tears\\", \\"Crawling to the USA\\" and \\"Tiny Steps\\". Several other tracks are repeats from the 2001 re-release, including the delightful alternate version of \\"Chelsea\\".<br /><br />CD2 (17 tracks; 63 min.) brings the complete show of the band at Washington's Warner Theatre, and what an absolute delight that is. This was recorded in February 1978, a couple of months before \\"This Year's Model\\" was released, and the set mixes then-old (from \\"My Aim Is True\\") and then-unheard (from the upcoming album) tracks, and it is just fabulous. Costello and his band are at their absolute best throughout. The highlight for me is the expanded (6 min.) version of \\"Watching the Detectives\\" but there isn't a single weak moment on here, and any serious music fan will want to have this, both for the quality of the concert and for its historical value. Not to be missed.
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|Bluray TV shows are a bargain compared to movies for price. This can be proven with some basic grade school math. The average new release movie on Bluray costs from $20 to $25 and runs around 120 minutes. This season of Lost had 14 episodes including the finale which will be a double episode. Each episode is about 42 minutes without ads. This gives a total of 588 minutes. Divide by 120 minutes and that equals the length of 5 movies. The price currently listed for this pre-release is $66. That gives a result of $13 per 120 minutes. That is less than any new Bluray movie. That just goes to show that season 3 was really a bargain at 23 episodes and around the same price. This took less than a minute to calculate. The shortened season has a high price only when compared to a full season and not compared to the average 2 hour movie on Bluray.
B000H5TVO4|5.0|By the time that Roxette's career blossomed, I'd largely lost interest in contemporary pop music beyond following artists that I was already familiar with, such as Madonna. I occasionally discovered other artists that I liked but mostly I ignored the pop music scene. Eventually persuaded to give Roxette a chance, I decided not to bother initially because I didn't want to pay the full price, but I seized the opportunity to buy this compilation when it was offered in a sale at a tempting price. Their sound is basically melodic pop/rock with an eighties/nineties edge.<br /><br />Comprising Per Gessle and Marie Fredriksson, Roxette's main period of commercial success ran from 1986 to 1994. During that period, four of their singles (The look, Listen to your heart, It must have been love, Joyride) made the very top of the American pop charts with two others (Fading like a flower, Dangerous) just missing the top spot, peaking at number two. Their British hit record was less spectacular, with five singles making the top ten, the most successful (It must have been love) peaking at number three first time around, later making the the top ten again when re-issued following its use in a TV commercial. Of the six major American hits, it's worth noting that one of them (Listen to your heart) was initially only a very minor hit. Re-issued as a double A-side with Dangerous (another of those big American hits) following the British success of It must have been love, it made the UK top ten, but as I wasn't paying attention, I don't know which side was the most popular. Another of those big American hits, Fading like a flower, just failed to make the UK top ten. Almost unreal (from the soundtrack of Super Mario Bros) also made the UK top ten, while three other songs (Wish I could fly, How do you do, Sleeping in my car) made the UK top ten in the nineties.<br /><br />Two songs recorded especially for this compilation (One wish, Reveal), both of which later became successful as singles around Europe, start and end this wonderful compilation that shows why Roxette were so popular.start and end this wonderful compilation that shows why Roxette were so popular.

B00009ATIX|5.0|Solaris has become stuck in my sub-conscience more than any other movie I have ever seen. When I first saw it in the theatre, I left a little bewildered, not quite sure what to think. I did know on some level though that it would always be with me. I have since seen Solaris many, many times and am still no clearer on what the \\"message\\" is. I know there are several obvious explanations as discussed in other reviews here, but there is more to it. Something about the experience taps into a basic human truth that we have not begun to realize. Beyond the dialogue and story are the images and sounds. Everything about Solaris is subtle, including the way it works it's way into your mind. I am not trying to sound pretentious. If that were the case I would offer explanations, and I have none. I completely understand why this film gets so many negative reviews. I do however feel sorry for those who can not allow themselves to be hypnotised by this film as I am. The acting is good and the diologue is fine, but that is not the point. The planet and music are the main characters. And let me just say as a former music major in college I feel at least a little bit qualified to say that the soundtrack by Cliff Martinez is an absolute friggin' MASTERPEICE. This is the greatest original score in film history. No other score in any film is so completely integrated into the experience as this one. Solaris would not exist without Cliff Martinez. The only thing I am sure of is that for some reason I feel a great sense of comfort at the end when Rhea says \\"we don't have to think like that anymore\\"
B000000OAN|5.0|When I first heard this album in a friend's car several years ago I knew I had to get it! Lively, tongue-in-cheek capering by a group that had so much to offer. Freddie Mercury's early death was a tragedy! At least we have this to remember just how versatile he was!
0743244257|3.0|I loved White Noise and Great Jones Street, so I expected to enjoy Cosmopolis.  Although it had some moments of brilliance, the protagonist of this work lacked authenticity, thus the work as a whole failed to capture my interest.

It is full of history (the interesting parts), insight, and practicality. I have enjoyed every word.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|This landmark November 1974 is equally a grand moment in the band's career and what also seemed to be a high-octane coda.<br /><br />Recorded in July and August, Robert Fripp disbanded the group in late-September, which meant the album was issued without an accompanying tour. Though supplemented with a number of musicians - Mel Collins (soprano sax), Ian McDonald (alto sax), Robin Miller (oboe), Mark Charig (cornet), David Cross (violin) - this is Fripp's venue, as he masterfully weaves guitar dubs throughout the compositions.<br /><br />The title track contains one of the greatest guitar solos from a recording studio, with Fripp taking his playing to incredible heights. Starless is arguably the finest track recorded by the group up to this point and remains a crowning achievement in a vast catalog of quality work.<br /><br />With John Wetton (bass, vocals) and Bill Bruford (drums, percussion) delivering in wickedly wonderful fashion, the album defies time, while re-defining the power trio concept.
B000VECAC6|4.0|Monty Python's most coherent film \\"Life of Brian\\" tells the story of Brian who just happens to be born next door to Christ. The parallel follows him his whole life as he is mistaken for the Messiah throughout his life. A very funny parody of the hypocrisy that often exists within religion, politics with a great interlude that pokes fun at \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Life of Brian\\" faced a lot of controversey before it was even released. The Pythons lost their funding from EMI and they faced the Coalition of Light a Christian group in the UK that attacked the film.<br /><br />Ironically, the Pythons DON'T lampoon JC as when they went back to the Bible to prepare the screenplay they realized he had terrific things to say. It was the follow thorugh that kind of sucked. Luckily, George Harrison stepped in and took out a second on several of his mansions to get the film made.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray looks extremely good. Does it look as great as a contemporary film? No but the film was shot on a low budget (around $4 million)but looks more expensive because the Pythons took advantage of the standing sets for other biblical epics. Although Terry Jones' direction is more pedestrian looking than Terry Gilliam (who does art direction, animation and appears in multiple roles here)he handles the characters and comedy extremely well.<br /><br />We get a 30 minute documentary on the making of the film with current interviews from the surviving Pythons (Graham Chapman who played Brian died of cancer over a decade ago), the current leader of th Coalition of Lights, critics and those associated with the production. It's a terrific documentary looking at the film's reception and even has clips from Tom Snyder's show where they appeared defending their work and a UK show where they did a showdown with a pair of religious leaders who attacked the film.<br /><br />There will always be those who don't \\"get\\" the film either because it's not to their taste or because they have religious objections (although I've found that usually those that do object for the second reason haven't seen the film or miss the fact that it is a satire of the politics and distortion of religious beliefs and not because it satires Christ--it doesn't--although it does satirize how we can often distort what we hear..as in the line \\"blessed are the cheesemakers\\" heard by one person because they are standing too far away from Christ when he gives his sermon on the mount to hear him and being razzed).

B0000DBJDM|5.0|One evening in 1973 I was watching reruns of 'Night Gallery' on my 10 inch black and white TV and I began flipping channels during the commercial to see what else was on.  On PBS I couldn't believe what I was seeing, PINK FLOYD!  I looked at the TV Guide and saw it Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii.  Needless to say, I did not go back to my other show and I looked in vain for years for a repeat of the show.  Well, now it is on DVD in color on my big screen TV and is an instant nostalgia device.  One thing I don't understand though is why everyone complains about the director's cut.  I agree that it isn't necessary since it detracts from the power of the original which launches right into the music without the 'fan club sentimentalities' and dressings of the director's cut.  But BOTH VERSIONS are on the disk, so watch the ORIGINAL CONCERT MOVIE first if you just want the simple truth and later watch the DIRECTOR'S CUT if you want more, but please don't whine.

This is the first U2 album I listened to and I have to say that it's a great album from beginning to finish.  The highlight is clearly the hit \\"Vertigo.\\"  My favorite songs are \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" and \\"Love And Peace Or Else.\\"  Why does this album have such a bad rating?  It's one of 2004's best albums in my opinion.  If you're new to U2 or an old fan check this album out.  It's worth it!
B000HEWEE4|2.0|OK, you may or may not like this film. You might be one of the ones who fell in love with this movie.    But does it worth 5 stars??? How come, as of May 26, 2008, 158 people out of 289 rated this movie 5 stars? This makes me ask 2 questions: 1) Seriously, if you think this movie is a 5 star  film, then how many stars would you give to the classics?? 1000 stars?? 2) Is not there any single thing to criticize in this film? Is it that impeccable? If so, then how come this film was not nominated for the Oscars? I am not fond of Oscars, but anyway, the 158 people out of 289 out there, your perspective is surely disparate than the Academy.    As to my perspective, IMHO, this was a typical Hollywood movie that was produced, what I call, \\"just to be produced\\", no more than that. The main aim of these type of films is to help you spend a pleasant time. In that respect this film is similar to a previous film called \\"Serendipity\\", for instance. But unlike that movie, it has some metaphysical stuff in it, which did not make any sense. Plus it was extremely boring and unnecessarily long.    Nonetheless I gave 2 stars because it was exciting in the beginning, made me curious about what will happen next. And it was not amongst the movies I watched that deserve 1 star.    The very reason I wrote this review was to stress the unnecessary ratings/stars given to the movies. This movie deserves neither 5 stars nor 1 star. This is a type of movie that needs to be rated between 2-4 stars, and my rating goes to 2 stars and I would not recommend anyone.

076790592X|5.0|An unforgettable and inspirational read for a lazy afternoon, once you start - hard to stop reading until you finish it - an inspiring true story about Mitch Albom and his old college professor, Morrie Schwartz who is dying of ALS disease. On Fourteen Tuesdays they discuss life, its meanings, and what is important about living and dying. As the disease progresses, Morrie begins to look at life uniquely and shares with Mitch that the thing he's learning most because of having this disease is \\"...how to give out love, and to let it come in.\\" Each week they discuss profound things that are yet so simple. They discuss the world, regrets, death, family, emotions, the fear of aging, forgiveness...and goodbye. Thru dying, Morrie teaches Mitch how to live.     This book is an absolute treasure and should be read by Everybody!! It teaches things that most people already know, but for some reason do not put into practice in everyday life. This book teaches us to cherish everyone and everything, love and compassion for others is such an important part of life.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This was an excellent production giving insight into the stark conditions faced by the people of this place and era. It also shows how one person can make a difference, especially when he/she is willing to learn from mistakes while not abandoning his/her principles. Margaret and Thornton are both masters at jumping to conclusions. Margaret is able to bring the mill workers and Master Thornton together for the betterment of both. Don't fail to watch the deleted extended proposal scene. It would have been far better to retain it in its entirety. The shortened version seems rather disjointed. However, it doesn't take away from the over all enjoyment. Romance and history join to make a very entertaining production. Well worth the time!

0061537934|2.0|I was excited when I saw the cover--a picture of a dog, the book being the story of a dog told from the dog's perspective. But the book was a disappointment. The story seems to be more about the humans than the dog. I only made it through about 10 chapters, and I skipped a lot of paragraphs, such as passages where the owner was giving the dog a play by play of a minor league NASCAR race.     Another problem is the book gets off on the wrong foot early--the dog's calculated behavior at the beginning (sorry for being vague, I'm trying to avoid spoilers) requires too much suspension of disbelief and creates a negative mood.    Edit: I went back and gave it another chance. It still isn't great but maybe it should be 2.5-3 stars instead. It's still too much about the humans and too little about the dog, but the ending was better than I expected.
B001675YQ6|5.0|This movie is fabulous! Cute romantic comedy that is not beyond making fun of itself.  The cast is great but the scene stealer is Catherine Tate who plays Tallulah. For me this is a \\"Must see\\"!
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|First of all if you didn't know this movie was shakey before you saw it, you are an idiot.  This movie had one of the largest viral marketing campaigns ever.  Secondly, I have seen this movie several times, including the theater (which it was awesome at), and have not once gotten sick or even close to feeling like I was going to be sick.  For one, it's only about an hour long.  Have you not watched home movies that were that shakey for an hour???  Yes, it's kinda dumb the guy would be carrying around a camera during all this, but if he didn't guess what???  There's no movie.  I thought it was creative, and a dang good entertaining monster movie.  You can't help but get some chills when the monster first attacks and you see the statue of liberty's head going rolling down the street.  I'm really surprised at all the bad reviews this movie is getting on amazon.  I guess we just need another romantic comedy.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|Ok watched this today and I am an Amazing spiderman fan from way and know all the characters and the timelines.    The good, pretty good job of trying to fit all those characters into one movie and bring us up to date. Best special effects out of all 3 and did not seem to have the number of visual errors the other 2 had. Kirsten Dunst still makes a great Mary Jane and best character acting to date is Rosemary Harris as May Parker with Jk Simmons as J.Jonah Hameson second.    Bruce Campbell in the restaraunt bit, best cameo of all 3 Spiderman Movies for him.    Thought all the actors did a pretty good job all came off as believable.    Could have been done better. The directing on Toby Maguire as Peter Parker, lines were dilvered great as spiderman, always seems a little off as Peter Parker.    The bad:     Spiderman still has no Webshooters, He's a genius and created is own webmaking fluid, This should have stayed in since the beginning.    The whole \\"Bad\\" Peter Parker/Spiderman bit went on way too long don't know if they just needed filler space or what. Could have cut that down to 30 seconds. It was just dumb.    Time line is ..WAYYY out of whack. Actual readers of the comics will vouch for this. It was a little hard buying the Sandman story line the way it was presented in the movie. Granted .Sandman was tough to fit his story into one movie.    and Yes I know all the characters, so following the storyline was not that hard, but most people do not. Lose one villian this move probably ends up being a winner.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|\\"Sicko\\" is a brilliant and powerful film. Exceptional for a documentary on a painful topic, \\"Sicko\\" is also a joy to watch. Michael Moore's mastery delivers laugh-out-loud funny scenes, and, then, with the whiplash tension of a rapid car chase, it wrenches tears from the viewer's eyes. Master magician that he is, Moore educates even while he entertains. You'll know more about the American health care system after watching this movie than after reading many a newspaper article.<br /><br />So far so good. The problem is that, as ever, Moore is selective in his truth telling. Moore compares America's monstrous and demonstrably murderous health care system to better systems in Canada, England, France, Cuba, and Norway. Moore is correct, and statistics back him up - if you compare statistics in industrialized countries on infant mortality, life expectancy, and level of health, by all important measures, Americans suffer from an abysmal health care system.<br /><br />The problem is this. Not only conservatives, whom Moore rightly blames, are responsible for America's mess; Limousine Liberals like Moore himself are *also* responsible.<br /><br />It is acceptable to promote an idea of national identity in Cuba, France, and Norway. If you feel that your next door neighbor is like you, and if you feel that you and your next door neighbor are part of the same team, you are more likely to pay into a health care system that protects your next door neighbor. Limousine Liberals helped to destroy America's sense of national identity, and the sense that all Americans are on the same team. Multiculturalism, hyphenated identities, and \\"hate America\\" ideology, combined with American individualism, atomized Americans. Sadly, Michael Moore is now supporting for president the poster child of hate America first ideology - Barack Obama, of Never-been-proud-of-America / God-d--n-America / black-supremacy fame. Limousine Liberalism drove Americans apart from Americans, and that is a big reason we don't have national health care.<br /><br />Another key factor Moore never so much mentions, an omission so egregious it weakens his entire thesis, is the impact of the welfare state on African American families and employment, and on all Americans' understanding of national health care.<br /><br />There are many thinkers, including African American ones (read, for example, Walter E. Williams), who insist that welfare destroyed the black family and work ethic. Illegitimacy among African Americans skyrocketed with the introduction of welfare, and employment plummeted. Americans are wary of big government programs exactly because of what happened with welfare. Moore may not like this fact, but if he wants to be successful in making the case for national health care - and I hope he is - he has to be part of increasing a sense of national identity that Americans can be proud of and feel invested in, and he has to explain how national health care will avoid the pitfalls of the welfare state.al health care.

After listening to the whole CD, I like other pieces from the work even more (Guinevere, Lady Of The Lake).  Though the Moog (Mellotron?) makes it sound a little dated, it's still very listenable, and it'll be nice to play on a rainy afternoon.  Though Wakeman was a member of Yes, I think this is going into the CD rack next to the Moody Blues' Days of Future Passed.

0783232039|5.0|A word of advice, if you're looking for special features, this DVD doesn't have much...but the film itself is RAD! Bride of Chucky is the return of the killer doll, and this film throws a lot of twists at the audience. It incorporates a lot of different genres in one, including: thriller, horror, and romantic comedy aspects.     Directed by Ronny Yu (Who also did Freddy Vs. Jason), BOC has a very graphic novel feel to it, and maintains a creepy atmosphere throughout the film. While the acting could use some help, the characters somehow hold up (the whole \\"I'm gonna vaporize you\\" scene is hilariously bad though).     Overall, watch this DVD for the film and not the extras. There is a behind the scenes part, but it's not all that great. If you're a Chucky fan, this is definitely for you!
B00005JPNZ|5.0|totally fun nostalgia. the entire cast is great, and what works best is that Spielberg takes elements from all 3 films, plus, the topic he knows the best- sci-fi, and adds it all together into a terrific action adventure. a fun film all around. and a...(read more)s a plus, Ford and Allen still have that spark from years ago!
0670018651|2.0|I am fascinated by scent, and was looking forward to this book. But it seemed to be just a blog of personal choices. The focus was definitely on the \\"artistic\\", unusual or skillfully crafted perfumes.     Almost none of the highly recommended fragrances \\"move\\" me, and it was hard to catch onto their passions. I appreciate that they have strong views, but we are so far appart, it's was like reading reviews of Avant Garde films, when I just want help deciding on which Blockbuster movie to see tonight. And there wasn't quite enough behind the scenes info to make it interesting for that dimension of the perfumes profiled.    Not for me.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|This film was clearly, from the outset, a conceptual mess.  The objective was clearly to smash together as many Beatles tunes as possible into one story, injecting plot devices as seemingly dictated by the most overly literal readings of Beatle lyrics.  The resulting effect is something like a cross-breeding of American Idol with a tacky off-Broadway musical, with a snippet of \\"Grease IV\\" (if such a wretched thing existed) thrown in.<br /><br />The objective of overcoming the audience with Beatles references overtakes everything else.  As a result, there is no depth or complexity to any of the characters, and all of the issues and scenes that are deemed emblematic of the 1960s are paraded past in their most superficial, stereotypical forms.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the violence that this does isn't only to history: the Beatles canon also suffers, with characters such as \\"Prudence,\\" \\"Jude,\\" \\"Sadie\\" and \\"Lucy\\" being reduced to 1960s archetypes, drained of whatever color the imagination invests in them in their original song contexts.<br /><br />The film lurches from one eye-rolling moment to the next: An Uncle Sam poster mouths \\"I Want You\\" in what feels almost like a parody of bad Broadway; a crowd totes the Statue of Liberty, singing \\"She's So Heavy,\\" (Get it??!) and Eddie Izzard presents Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite in a style that evokes no one so much as Austin Powers.  Prudence sings a wretchedly maudlin \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" at an absurdly choreagraphed football practice.  \\"Let it Be\\" is bludgeoned to death in a shrieking parody of gospel. It's often hard to tell whether any of it is supposed to be taken seriously, or whether it's an exercise in trying to achieve Ed Wood \\"so-bad-it's-good\\" status.<br /><br />One ironic consequence of all of this is to remind one of what it was that made the Beatles so great.  The Beatles were never syrupy, mawkish, over-emoting.  There's no Mariah-Carey-meets-Whitney-Houston song-pulverizing in their recordings.  There's a strong sense of self-awareness, often a wink and a nod, throughout. Even the loveliest and most emotional tunes, like \\"Julia,\\" aren't overdone.<br /><br />For the true fan of the Beatles, this movie is a nightmare: many of us would have enjoyed daring, creative covers of Beatle tunes.  But instead they all get the American Idol treatment here; emotion and performance are exaggerated in the worst, self-indulgent ways.  I found myself eventually fast-forwarding through the song performances, they were all so horrendously over-the-top.  And given that the plot was absurdly hackneyed and contorted on the songs' behalf to begin with -- that doesn't leave much of a film.<br /><br />There is one exception: the performance of \\"Because\\" is genuinely beautiful.  Perhaps this is because it's faithfully done in three-part harmony, with no soloist being given free rein to destroy it. (Bono's \\"I am the Walrus\\" is done wryly enough to be tolerable also.)<br /><br />All in all, a painfully horrific experience.  It's clearly a 1-star film, although I will admit I started to revel a bit in the awfulness of it after a while.  My poor wife wasn't able to do this, having fled the room in terror after a mere half an hour (I was able to reassuringly report to her  that it got only negligibly better afterwards.)areness, often a wink and a nod, throughout.

Couldn't take advantage of the wide-screen feature but perhaps I'll upgrade systems in the future and enjoy the full effect.

B0010X745K|2.0|There should have been another line from one of the soldiers about 40 - 50 minutes into The Mist:  \\"These may very well be the stupidest people on the planet... maybe we should just shoot them.\\" Ok, so I stole that line from the hilarious \\"Ruthless People.\\" Still, it would have made the only truly sensible line in the movie.<br /><br />Through out this movie the characters do things or fail to do things that no one in their right mind would or would not do in a crisis situation.  Plus you get the Bible thumping zealot who shows up in just about every Stephen King adaptation movie these days and it is really getting rather tiresome, even if you don't like religious zealots.  Enough!  There are many situations that are just downright stupid and I'll point a couple of them out:<br /><br />1.  Going to the pharmacy next door to get pain killers for a guy who has been injured and is in terrible pain.  Knowing that everyone who steps foot outside the door and into the mist ends up dying violently, why would at least 1/2 dozen people go to get the drugs when, at most it might take two heros for this mission?<br /><br />2.  When the star and starlet decide it's time to go, there's eight people who go out into the mist to get into our hero's SUV.  Of course half of these people don't make it.  Um... if YOU or I were leading this courageously stupid group of people, would it not make more sense for 1 or 2 people to make a run for the truck and then drive it right up to the doors to collect the others? I mean, what father in his right mind would risk his 8 year old son so recklessly when the kid could simply wait inside for the truck to pull up? Ridiculous.<br /><br />The Mist is one of my all-time favorite short stories. If memory serves me correctly (it's been at least 20 years since I read it), the mist is never explained and that's part of the story's magic.  In the movie, we get the tired old \\"the military was messing with stuff it had no business messing with\\" explanation. Why was there a need to explain it?<br /><br />The acting was good, the effects were pretty good, especially the flying creatures being torched in the store.  Then again, wouldn't YOU or I have had the common sense to have a fire extinguisher handy so as not to burn down our shelter?  These are really STUPID characters.<br /><br />When the bag boy is being pulled off the loading dock by the tentacles, wouldn't it have made since to simply lower the loading dock door, thereby severing the tentacles? Wouldn't YOU or I have at least TRIED that approach?  More stupidity.  These folks don't deserve to survive in a survival of the fittest world.  Makes one wonder how they managed to stay alive throughout life.<br /><br />The logical arguments with the attorney are just lame. No one would be THAT stupid after being shown that tentacle with all the teeth.<br /><br />The irony in the ending just seemed like the screen play writer was trying way to hard too do something shocking.

032147404X|5.0|This is probably the best how-to photography book I've ever read. This covers only a few topics that general consumers are interested most. This book is very easy to read. This is a vertical dissect of the interested areas. Instructions are very clear and precise. This helps you to the take reasonably good (if not professional) looking pictures very quickly. From there, you would have enough skills to expand your horizon. Enjoy!

B0006J28L4|3.0|I am a huge fan of the book, but the movie has so many flaws that it left me hungry for a better film.  The good:  The acting by Denzel Washington is great.  He brings life to a man that most of us knew only as an angry man.  His smile and spirit (and almost dead on physical similarity to Malcolm) brought so much to humanize him.  Spike Lee couldn't have cast the main role any better and he was responsible for writing a great likable living Malcolm.  It was also nice to see Ernest Thomas aka Roger from the TV show \\"What's Happening\\" ('hey hey hey Raj!\\").  The bad is that several of the other actors were not nearly as good.  Al Freeman Jr. was terrible as Elijah Muhammad and it bordered on comical how clunky.  Nothing was clunkier than the music that was chosen for the movie.  It really pulled you out of the scene, especially the music during the Mecca visit.  It sounds like a song from a 1970s bad documentary.  The scene with Malcolm and his wife discussing their personal lives was destroyed by the terrible music.    One highlight was Lee's choice to use Ozzie Davis' voice for the eulogy.  Since he wrote and delivered it at the actual funeral, it was a brilliant move to have it recreated by him for the film.    I am not a huge fan of Spike Lee's work, but this movie is epic and he did an amazing job of condensing a great book.  The life of Malcolm X was perfect for a movie.  It really is a life in 3 acts, and the third act has the rewards of his life before, but also the penalty of his previous life, which he can't escape.  Sadly there were parts that were missing including the debt he owed his Aunt.  She was pivotal in the book, and even one scene with her would have helped explain where he got the money to go to Mecca.    The picture of the DVD is great, but the sound is just average with some of the dialog mixed very low.  The 2 disk set has a great deal of extras that make it worth it.  The deleted scenes were wisely left out of the original movie.  Nice to seethem (love DVDs for this!) but Lee was very smart to not include most of them.  The hunger scene was great, but didn't fit in the movie.  I do wished he would have included the scene about the white girl who wanted to help, but was not given the opportunity.  Lee filmed a follow up scene that redeemed Malcolm, but for some reason didn't include it.  The omission of this one scene left me frustrated because it really showed how his humanity had changed after his trip to Mecca.  He finally embraced a new self and Denzel played it so well.  Luckily it is one of the deleted scenes so enjoy it.    Overall, I wish he had spent another 20 dollars on the soundtrack.  He might have gotten something that wasn't so distracting and it would have made the movie much stronger.  The music fights the moods so many times it really reminds you that you are watching a movie.  Much of it sounds like temp music that he just slapped in there regardless of how it affected the emotion of the scene.
1577314808|1.0|I'm sorry, but this book is terrible.  I wish I hadn't wasted my hard-earned money on it.  I fought to just get through it so that I could write this review in good faith of having read the entire book.<br /><br />My major problem with this book is Eckhart Tolle's writing style.  It's obnoxious and condescending.  If you believe yourself to be even remotely intelligent, you'll likely be offended by his writing style in this book.  Not only that, but he jumps around so much and repeats and re-repeats himself that it's actually confusing, along with being dull and repetitive.  In my opinion, this book was crafted by taking most of it's ideas from Zen Buddhism and turning them into pop-psychology love-yourself nonsense with some buzzwords thrown in.  A reader would be much better served by buying an introductory book to Zen Buddhism.<br /><br />Of note, I also found his description of women during their \\"menses\\" extremely offensive, and his attempt to sound non-homophobic after repeated references to the \\"completeness\\" of the man-woman relationship came off as completely insincere.  If Oprah feels this nonsense helps her, that's wonderful, but it certainly only left me with an empty feeling in my wallet.

B0013D8LOU|1.0|I finally got around to renting this movie and was seriously disappointed.<br />The story was mediocre.<br />The costumes were excellent.<br />The singing was at best amateurish. When is Hollywood going to get it thru their head that a musical requires people who can sing. If these voices had been in the Broadway version they would have been laughed off the stage.<br />Worst of all, the sound mix was terrible. The orchestration was so loud that better than 70% of the movies lyrics and dialog were unintelligible. I spent most of the movie trying to guess what they were saying or singing.<br />Most of the people that wrote good reviews of this product are sheep that are continuing to mouth the praises of the Broadway version. I bet they never even heard the DVD version.<br />Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.

0307387178|4.0|Into the Wild was our May book club selection, and I put off reading it until a few days before our meeting. Thinking it was a \\"guy book,\\" I didn't even bother buying my own copy. That was a mistake, for once I began reading my borrowed book, I was entranced. Krakauer's writing style was captivating and managed to hold my attention from page one. Not only do we learn about Chris McCandless (a.k.a. Alexander Supertramp) and his family, but we learn about Krakauer's experiences, meet some fascinating folks who befriended Chris, and discover much about the geography and nature of various parts of the United States.<br /><br />Yes, the writing itself was great. It's the story of Chris McCandless, however, that haunts me. How could someone with such promise act so foolishly? I can well understand the inner voice to \\"Go west, young man,\\" but to travel into the Alaskan wilderness without compass or adequate provisions is utter folly. And this was a intelligent young man, a recent college graduate who had been raised with advantages unknown to many.<br /><br />Chris was, like most of us, a bundle of contradictions. He was idealistic and gave all of his remaining college fund to an organization to feed the hungry; yet he sponged off of many of the people who befriended him. He was angry with his parents for living a lie, but he couldn't see that without his parents he wouldn't have had the resources that allowed him to finish Emory. He's perturbed at their treatment of him, but he treats them even more abominably by not even letting them know he's alive. Yes, he had \\"issues,\\" but don't most people? Was he too fragile to handle them? If he had survived the wilderness, would he have returned to West Virginia with a softened heart and a more mature attitude?<br /><br />Was he just a narcissist? Was he another affluent, sheltered, idealistic young man angry with society? Was he a typical young person in search of adventure? Did he feel any guilt at all about capturing the hearts of those he met when he bid them adieu?<br /><br />I have my own copy of Into the Wild now. It's a great story about an intense, idealistic, determined young man who died in a deserted bus after eating a poisonous plant. While the reader will learn a great deal about nature, geography, and \\"adventure,\\" he or she will also be forced to look at the psychological questions that Chris and his choices evoke.n he bid them adieu?

I knew by watching the previews that it was going to be shot that way so why so why are so many whiny about the camera? I was so into the movie I really didn't pay attention to the handheld camera thing. It seems that people hate this movie for the wrong reasons. That's all on that but anyway    I thought this movie was different and made me really think what if?

Then I realized it was necessary in order  to get my mind in the correct mind-set. From then on I couldn't put the book down, wanting to see what new thoughts would come next.

It's unpredictable and it's one of those films that make you jump because you realize it actually is possible for something like this to happen, though you may not fully realize that until after the movie ends.<br /><br />It's not very likely in real life for a bunch of people to get stranded at a motel with an insane murderer, but stick with the movie and you'll find out in the end how and why that happened.<br /><br />I can't say more without spoilers, and this one shouldn't be spoiled.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|Well first let me say I love Quinton(though not as much as my bro BLACKSHERE) But the man has talent and love the 70's(YEEEEEES) So I was<br />doing happy dances(I WAS) while the GRIND HOUSE credits were coming up<br />and than the movie starts<br /><br />We have a car full of women talking about really nothing and I mean nothing!<br />40 min go by of this before the movie starts for me.  First I am a Kurt<br />Russell fan and a known truth he was married to a second cousin of mine<br />the actress SEASON HUBLEY(your bro Clint really is Denny Hubley...SHHH!)<br />and though I never met her members of my family have and also Kurt.<br />Anyway back to the movie Kurt is a stunt driver who is MEGLOMANIA<br />in the head and loves to release his sexual urges by meeting his victims<br />hearing them talk and than ripping them apart with his car.  Fantastic<br />story had the man Quinton stayed with that and not his BORRRRRzzzING<br />script with the girls.  BLACKSHERE Bro I was looking at my watch from time to time...SCARY to do that in a QUINT PIC.  Anyway the effects<br />are great and the ending surprising so 3 stars.  This is however the worst Tarantino picture I have seen.  Still the worst Tarantino is far better than the multi-million dollar films HOLLYWOOD puts out.  See this<br />YES!!!  Buy this NO!!!!!!  Again Quint has a lot A LOT of talent and<br />still believe he can produce gold like he has in the past.  What I would<br />like from THE PIMP DADDY is a HORROR film from him....A REAL HORROR<br />film not a DUSK TILL DAWN(don't get me wrong it was good) BUT A REAL<br />HORROR FILM.  That would be SWEEEEEET.  Oh again back to DEATH PROOF<br />here is the movie in a nut shell- girls yapping-YAP-YAP-YAP-YAP-YAP<br />YAP-YAP-FEET-YAP-YAP-YAP-FEET-YAP-YAP-YAP-VERY COOL DEATH SCENE-MORE<br />YAPPING-YAP-YAP-YAP-FEET-FEET-YAP-FEET-VERY COOL ENDING the end
B0013FDM7E|4.0|I continue to be surprised at Will Smith's acting ability. This isn't exactly a remake of the two prior films loosely based on the same topic, and Will Smith did an excellent job in his role.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />There are no \\"vampires\\" in the movie. There are no \\"zombies.\\" The agressive creatures are mutated and hairless, but still retain intelligence, and don't hunt people to bite their necks and drink their blood. They're methodical and simply sensitive to light.<br /><br />The venue is NYC, as always, and that's disappointing. Horror/sci-fi movies make it seem that nothing catastrophic could ever happen elsewhere.<br /><br />I teared up when Will Smith had to kill his dog, his only friend and companion. At the time, as far as he knew, he and his dog were the only non-violent creatures that existed.<br /><br />The part about the lady who showed up and said God had told her where to go was just absolutely silly. They could have put a much better spin on why she was going where she was going.<br /><br />Sounds like I didn't like the movie, but I really did. There were a lot of other realistically unbelievable aspects (like the fact that humans typically become psychotic without other human contact over long periods of time), but the movie was well worth watching, beyond the crazy, non-sci-fi aspects of it.
B00000F169|5.0|Who says you have to have a big budget to make a very funny 70's Sci-Fi movie spoof.  The instrument panel on the spacecraft was egg cartons with lighting underneath.  I have not seen many films before or since where the space alien is an oversized beach ball.  And, as a surfer, I loved the ending. But I'm not telling.  If you want to know how it ends, buy the DVD.<br /><br />This would be a cult classic even if it had not been done by John Carpenter. Brian Narelle is now an Emmy award winning television writer and an illustrator/cartoonist.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This movie was so bad that's it's hard to find much to say about it, other than that it's worse than Blair Witch. It may be artsy in some peoples' minds to film movies of people filming movies with a camcorder, but that was already badly done in Blair Witch, and it's even more badly done in this one (believe it).<br /><br />The acting was less than awful, but the plot and storyline were boring and unbelievable even within the genre. The movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Why in a country the size of the US, do monsters always attack NY? Why do they never attack places like Idaho? Hasn't the filmmaking industry put NY through enough? Why doesn't the guy doing the filming put down the camera and help his friends? Why doesn't the battery in the camera die? What brand of camera is this? I need one of them. Why do bridges never get destroyed by monsters when no one is on them? Why do historic monuments always get destroyed? Do aliens and monsters really prefer those over all the rundown buildings, even in NY?<br /><br />The Blair Witch Project at least had an interesting plot even if the movie itself was bad. There is nothing redeeming in Cloverfield. It's one of those movies that don't just leave you wondering if you can get your money back, but instead wondering if you can receive punitive damages for the nausea and the time you wasted watching it.<br /><br />According to Amazon, people who bought this movie also bought The Mist. If you like to be scared, get that one instead. It was brilliant, horrifying, and very disturbing.
0143038419|2.0|First off, Elizabeth Gilbert is obviously a gifted author and a genius with words.  I give her praise for her wit and charm.    Courageous?  Please.  I like many know the pain of divorce. Probably many of you reading this do as well.  No paid year off to find myself here.  Back to work, and the support of friends, family, and my church. It is a shame so many of us know the ritual.    You want to know courage after divorce?  There are nine fabulous divorced moms in my church group.  They face raising their kids, losing their homes, and getting back to work to make ends meet. I have seen their tears and heard their stories.  These women are heroes. No paid break for them. No book advances, no movies, no appearances on Oprah here people.      And I am reminded this Memorial Day of the husbands and wives who wait years for their loved one to come home from military service.  And for some that day will never come.    I understand that Ms. Gilbert may also pen a book on marriage.  What a joke. She cheated on number one (funny how she sneaks that into the text with a subtle mention of when she is in David's apartment). She took her hot older Brazilian lover Felipe (Jose), and evidently married him later to work around some immigration issues.  So what is marriage to her?    Jose, watch out man. Think about 15 years from now... Liz around 50, you coming up on 70... The charmed life of Oprah and NYT Best Seller Lists and Hollywood a memory...     You want to know something about marriage?  Ask that quiet old married couple that has seen 40+ years together of job changes, sickness, maybe kids, deaths, graduations, good times, bad times, and everything in between.     A fun little book to read, but take it with a grain of salt... a nice escape from reality.
B0000844I8|4.0|The film was a smash hit world wide and spawned such television shows as Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Infiniti.    A team of scientists and soldiers travel to another galaxy to explore its link to ancient earth. Once there they find it under the rule of an alien creature claiming itself to be the egyptian god Ra. This does not go well with the team and they begin a campaign to show the alien for the false god it is and destroy his loyal army. The film has a great story and nicely melds itself into egyptian lore.    DVD Notes  The current version of \\"The Ultimate Edition\\" is the theatrical cut with a mini-documentary.  The re-release of the \\"Special Edition\\" also containes the theatrical cut of the film.    I suggest finding the original 03' release that containes the director's cut as well and a 23-minutes feature. it can be found in the \\"Collectible\\" section of used sellers.
1400063515|4.0|I thought this book was a really interesting read, but it wasn't one where you can easily see how to apply what you read.<br /><br />For instance, the author does a great job of demonstrating how random life can be...for example, the stories about the true risks of a Las Vegas casino and the work habits of Onassis were really entertaining and made the point about black swans...but knowing that life is random doesn't really lend itself to knowing how to live in a random world.<br /><br />The book can get a bit long-winded at times, but it's still well worth reading, especially if you're looking for something to expand your mind vs looking to make specific life changes.
B0007939NO|5.0|This is a wonderful tale of a little town in Scotland that was placed under a magical spell - it only comes to life one day every 100 years.  That way, it stays safe and protected from the rest of the world....the only problem is, no one can ever leave.  But that doesn't stop people from coming in - and when Gene Kelly arrives, you get lots of great dancing and great songs.  An all-around beautiful love story that spans ages and ages!
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Although it's pretty much a given that there is violence in this film, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" actually starts off pretty innocently. Yet, the entire film eventually skyrockets with shocking twists that are amazingly accurate depictions of mining life.<br /><br />\\"There Will Be Blood\\" is set in the early 1900s, with Daniel Plainview, a prospector who hits paydirt with his first oil platform. Soon enough, he builds an oil derrick, and eventually builds a strong company. After one of his workers dies, he adopts the man's son.<br /><br />Daniel becomes a big oil tycoon, and begins to build up an empire with the help of a man named Paul Sunday. Paul informs him of the oil below the surface of Signal Hill, California. Daniel builds a stable oil company, after paying Paul's brother, Eli, for his church.<br /><br />Then things go wrong. Daniel's son, H.W., is left deaf after an oil derrick explosion. Daniel also meets a strange man who says that he is Daniel's brother. And, of course, Eli keeps asking for more money. And what happened to H.W's mother?<br /><br />There are many strange conspiracies left unsaid in the artsy film \\"There Will Be Blood.\\" Daniel Day-Lewis pulls off a great performance as an oil tycoon, caught in the empty mining community in which he earns most of the profits.<br /><br />Strangely enough, Day-Lewis has no wife. In fact, there are hardly any females to be seen in the movie, leading to unusual socio-sexual changes within his life. In particular, he befriends a man who identifies himself as Daniel's brother. The man is pretty much Day-Lewis's only close friend for part of the series, because of his lack of interest in women, presumably caused by his hatred of his mother. Because of the forbidden homosexual tone which this film takes later, tensions rise quickly between the two.<br /><br />He also has problems with Eli, a preacher in the town, and his family. Daniel has to pay Eli to keep his claim to the oil well. However, Day-Lewis hardly gives a hoot for Eli's religious services, which leads to a fanatical transformation.<br /><br />Paul Dano pulls off a stunning performance as Eli, the evangelical preacher. Ignored by the miners, he decides to attract the attention of the rest of the town through his sensational sermons. Daniel watches the sermons with scorn, but hardly realizes that his ignorance has led to Dano's erratic behavior.<br /><br />The ending, however, is an awesome array of excellent back talking between Dano and Day-Lewis. And while I never imagined that these characters would make such creative use of bowling balls and bowling pins, I enjoyed watching how overly fanatical the two tycoons were.<br /><br />This is a crazy film where nothing ever ends happy. This is a film about greed, but this is also a historically accurate depiction of early California life. Although we may see it as the most fantastic and devilish film of the year, it is also an extremely brilliant character study of the western mining community, with a lop-sided men-to-women population.

B000VNMMR0|4.0|It's a given in this kind of film that the bad guys will miss 2,000 shots with a submachine gun, while the hero kills three of their guys with but two bullets from his handgun. Live Free or Die Hard squeezes every bit of believability out of any number of those scenarios, but who really cares? This film isn't meant to be judged as to whether or not it \\"feels realistic.\\" As Willis's McClane would say - \\"Screw realism! I'm in it to win it!\\"<br /><br />So, what started as a series about a normal guy trying to save his family from a small hostage situation has turned into story about an indestructible superhero who is unstoppable. He is unkillible. He doesn't need to eat, or sleep, or even go to the bathroom.<br /><br />Frank McClane has become the terminator, dude, and the bad guys better watch their back.<br /><br />Frank's characters can never be allowed to work alone, as his alphamale energy would eventually send off a ray that will kill every other person except Robert DeNiro. So, they team him with a comic fool, in this case, the funny and charming Justin Long, who is the perfect beta man counterpart for the Willisater.<br /><br />Also along for the ride is Frank's lovely daughter Rudy, who proves to be  a nicer, prettier terminator. Like father, like daughter. Run, Justin.<br /><br />Now, once you accept the preposterousness of much of what's happening, you can just enjoy it as good fun. There are spectacular set pieces, including one involving a truck, a jet fighter and a collapsing overpass.  Just keeping track of the various elements must have been exhausting!<br /><br />Soon, they'll be able to make everything look real in the movies, although not the two Kung-Fu fighers Willis had to handle.  They were flipping, floating and repelling off floors like characters out of the Matrix.  Just one more heave dose of unreality to bring down the scene.<br /><br />Still, the show holds together. Willis and Long keep the franchise feeling fresh - I certainly hope Long gets to do more like this now that he's the \\"Apple Guy.\\" Turn off your mind and turn on your adrenaline receptors and get ready for the ride of your life..\\" Turn off your mind and turn on your adrenaline receptors and get ready for the ride of your life.

B000002AVF|3.0|Very good CD but I prefer the dance versions of Mariah music better.  Sometimes her albums are a bit slow and I wish she would pick up the pace a bit.  She is capable.  I know she can do it.  Anyway, Mariah is pretty awesome...I love her!!!!!
0393312836|5.0|Great book, a little hard to read a first because of the slanguage.  But you will get used to it and it will be easier to read.  I did not see the movie until I finished the book and the book is better, of course!!  A classic!!!
0793563836|5.0|This book includes 143 jam-packed pages and two CD's into a great package for the self-taught and beginning-to-intermediate players taking lessons.  The book takes a well-rounded approach to bass playing, giving attention to essential scales, triads, ergonomic issues, and several styles.  The book also touches on specialized techniques such as hammer ons and pop-and-snap.<br /><br />Using this method at a slow and studied pace will equip the muscially-inclined bass player to hold their own in most pop-music settings.  If you want to be the next Jaco Pastorius, however, the journey only begins here.

B000F4RHB6|5.0|This is an excellent album. Every song is a favorite. I can't reccomend this album enough.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|After a decade, Portishead sounds more down to earth then the previous albums. It still has the absolute unique sound of Portishead, but a liitle more mature and less intimate.   The vocals of Beth Gibbons,remain stunning and esoteric, just beautiful.     Conclusion: it's somewhat different and modernized, yet still a little piece of art.
B00005JPFH|3.0|Any follow up to Spiderman 2 was going to be a little bit of a letdown, but this one tried to cram to much in at once. After all the build up to Harry vs. Peter, I think they did that story a disservice by not having it be the focus of the film. I also think they did a disservice to the Venom character by cramming him into an already loaded film.
0374105235|5.0|A Long Way Gone, a Sarah Crichton Book published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, is a gut wrenching memoir of a child soldier, caught in the violence of Sierra Leone's civil war in 1992.  Author Ishmael Beah's personal experiences in this conflict, coupled with his ability to tell his story with great insight and emotion, will capture most readers from the very first paragraph.    Even the book's title has interesting multiple meanings.  The child Ishmael is a long way gone from home and all that is familiar; a long way gone from normal civilized behavior as part of the drug and violence induced madness of army life and a long way gone from where he ended as a soldier and penned this book.     Stripped of his family, home and friends by the ever encroaching war, Ishmael struggles to escape and survive the war that eventually draws him into its web spun with threads of fear, violence, death, and destruction.  Once trapped, he embraces the insanity of drugs and the unchecked cruelty that stokes the war's fires.     The book is not a detailed chronology, but a dramatic and perceptive retrospective of events through the lens of a child, explaining how that child can be transformed into a blood thirsty soldier intent on killing for killing's sake.  Beah is able to weave touching moments and memories throughout the violence that both help and hinder Ishmael's ability to withstand the mental anguish that war inflicts.  Beah relates the dramatically harrowing story of being swept up into the raging civil war with raw emotion, but in an emotionally detached style that evokes the psychological detachment needed to be a child, especially a child soldier, able to survive the experience.  Proving himself to be a masterful storyteller, Beah`s book is filled with tales, fables, adventures, insights and dialogue both frightening and tender.    The author's ability to look back at his life reflectively with an understanding sadness of what he was forced to do in order to live and survive makes this book a compelling read.  Beah takes great care in painting the picture of innocence lost, day by day and piece by piece to the death, devastation and terror of war. He states, \\"These days I live in three worlds: my dreams, and the experiences of my new life, which trigger memories from the past.\\"    Beah is able to convey that the love of family, the value of friendship and the resilience of human spirit can transcend and survive the unimaginable chaos and fear that war brings in its wake. However, he takes great care to demonstrate that chance plays a large role in determining who and what survives.    This book is highly recommended reading, even for the younger reader, as the story possesses some great lessons of value.  Although some might feel that this book is too bloody, vivid and real for the younger reader, those twelve and older should be able to handle the material.   At least they aren't facing the dilemma that young boys of twelve faced in Sierra Leone in the Nineteen-Nineties:  to run for your life, to fight to stay alive or to die simply because you were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
B000QFAJ7S|1.0|I have never seen American Idol, but I enjoyed Kelly's first few songs on the radio. Her second album was excellent. This one was horrible and I have returned it.
B0016B6ZKG|2.0|In all fairness, my vote falls on the preliminary side since I've only purchased the more popular songs from the album as far as itunes ratings go.  (Stamp Your Feet, Mr. Music, I'm a Fire, Drivin' Down Brazil)  I've always been a huge Donna Summer fan, and it's dissapointing to have to give a negative review.  I know Donna Summer is not Madonna nor Mariah Carey, but this is what her new album might be compared to.  Summer has and will always have the ability to pull out dancefloor music as the way Madonna and others are doing it now, but Crayons is just not up to snuff.  Maybe it's not even the intention of the album, but try listening to Crayons after listening and visualizing what the hip dancefloor scene looks like cranked with Hard Candy songs.  Just not going to cut it and in all honesty, it's not the singer, maybe the help.

B000GH3CVQ|5.0|Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are a dynamic duo.  This is hauntingly beautiful and energizing music.  Definitely see the movie \\"Once\\" as well.  This CD shares three songs with the soundtrack to the movie and the other pieces are in the same vein.  It's genuine, gutsy music with awesome harmonies and real lyrics.  It makes you glad to have ears.
B000957O82|5.0|Hilarious movie that my husband and I enjoy watching together.  One of the few romantic comedies that is not filled with language and sexuality.  We received this DVD promptly, and in excellent condition.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|I have been patiently waiting for the coming of a new album. So when I heard that they had just finished cutting their third album, I jumped to buy it. As always a really great listen, nothing noticeably different. Still mellow and unique. If you are a die-hard trip-hop fan, this is a must for your collection. :)
B001A5HBAG|5.0|I found Mad Men to be a very interesting show. I was a child in the time frame this show is set and I really enjoy the flashbacks of how society was back then. Lots of smoking and drinking and there's obviously no concern for second hand smoke affecting the kids - even smoking in the doctors exam room! Cleverly written and lots of plot possibilities that are setup for season two.

0143036556|3.0|Diamond's books are always filled with interesting facts and thought provoking theories about ancient societies. But while I enjoy reading his books, I find his conclusions are often undeveloped.    Although Diamond makes an effort to distance himself from environmental determinism, his writings can often be classified as just that. A typical example can be found in the last chapter, when he notes that the countries with the greatest environmental problems are the same countries with the greatest political problems, concluding that lack of environmental awareness leads to social upheaval. But when evaluating any correlation, the researcher must be aware of directionality (does A cause B or does B cause A?) and a potential third variable (are A and B caused by C?). Only one explanation is considered.    More generally speaking, Diamond seems to pick and choose his examples to fit his theories. I find it very suspicious that in a book that examines the failures of past societies, he neglects to include the ancient Romans!     I'm also annoyed that with such a voluminous collection of statistics, he never uses footnotes. When an author makes the claim that we must solve all of 12 environmental problems within the next 50 years or the world will be doomed to some level of disaster, I want ample citations. I recommend any of Diamond's readers to take a look at Bjorn Lomborg's, \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist,\\" and see how a researcher should cite his sources. (And, interestingly, how much more optimistic Lomborg is about the state of the world.)
B0013FDM7E|3.0|Remake of the classic Omega man. Although the special effects were great no real improvement on the original. Worth watching and holds true to the original story.

0446677450|2.0|I found this book very negative and not helpful. He talks about how going to school and working hard being a waste of time. What about those people who enjoy the possibility of a career and being a master in their field? Yes, many of us want to be rich, but please do not bash those who went to school and are very proud of their accomplishments. The author's dad was a teacher, a very honored career, yet he bashes his real dad constantly through the book. I had a migraine half way through the book and could not finish it.

B000UBMWG4|4.0|I have always been fond of Harrison Ford and his films, but this film is hard to sum up, It has so many intriging aspects like genetic engineering, what murder is vs. \\"retirement\\", overpopulation, etc. However, it lacks character development, and fails to display the replicants as Brutal, but rather as misled, abandonned beings. You actually start to feel sorry for them on a number of occasions, further strengthening the argument of why Genetic cybord/android  clones with emotions is dangerous and wrong. I only hope they come out with sequels based on the books. If they were to do that then this movie could easily become one of the greatest movies of all time. it is kinda like star wars without the empire strikes back, and return of the jedi by itself its a good film but with other films building on its foundation it would be phenomenal.
B0015519VS|4.0|Overall, this was a good project. The music is catchy. It's funny...when \\"Love In This Club\\" came out I didn't like it at all. Like most songs these days it grew on me. I really loved the remix when it was released on the radio about a month ago. And I'm not even a big fan of bouncy Beyonce or Lil Wayne! The only song I didn't particularly care for was \\"What's a Man to Do.\\" The music got annoying after a few seconds.   Anyways, I cannot wait to purchase my copy today. Definitely well worth the four-year wait after Confessions. But just asking, is Apple/iTunes the only place where I can purchase the deluxe edition of this CD?
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This was one of the best pieces of history I have seen in a very long time.  Many of the blues players interviewed will not be with us much longer, and Mr. Shepherd captured true living history.  It is not necessary to be into the blues music to appreciate this DVD and CD.  It is America at it's finest moments and some embarassing moments.
0143038583|5.0|I stumbled upon this book on accident and am glad to have found it.  Pollan is an amazing writer. This book was very easy to read and provided much needed information about the treatment of animals and how other food is processed, without being preachy. This book has made me think twice before putting food into my shopping cart. Insightful, informative,and his tidbits of humor keep the pages light when need be.

From everything I read and heard from others, I figured it had a good shot at appealing to my inner hopeless romantic and went into my first viewing with an open mind and a hopeful heart.<br /><br />I was let down, big time.  There's nothing remarkable about this movie at all.  It's Hallmark movie of the week stuff from start to finish.  The only thing in it that escapes pure banality is the pure saccharine of the relationship between the older leads, played by Gena Rowlands and James Garner.  I admit, I got a lump in my throat watching them together, especially in their final scenes.  However, the story is extremely lopsided, because the younger version of these characters, played by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling, have no chemistry at all.  If it weren't for the dedication of Rowlands and Garner, I never would have believed in this couple's so-called great love story at all.<br /><br />And really, what's so great about this story?  A poor boy lays eyes on a rich girl (how original) and pesters her to go out with him.  They dance in the middle of a street.  Suddenly they're in love???  Unfortunately, I couldn't buy it.  I expected more from a talented actor like Gosling, but he seems completely unable to make this mediocre material work.  Even Joan Allen can't manage to rise above this pablum.  Meanwhile, this movie is supposed to take place in the South, but not a single actor manages to speak with a convincing southern accent.  Some, like \\"Entourage's\\" Kevin Connolly, don't even bother to try.  There isn't a single scene he appears in where he sounds like anything other than the New Yorker that he is.<br /><br />The whole film is sloppy, poorly cast and useless -- aside from the compelling romance between the two elderly people, there is nothing here worth passing on, or recommending.  The extras are nothing special either, although seeing Rachel McAdams in a screen test makes you wonder how awful the other nine actresses who reportedly tried out must have been for her to win this role.  And hilariously, in the editor's commentary over the deleted scenes, he points it out when scenes were deleted in part due to bad acting.  He's more diplomatic that that, of course -- he'll say something like, \\"Not the strongest performance\\" -- but the meaning is obvious.  Let's face it: when even the editor thinks the acting stinks, there's a serious problem.  The casting director for this film ought to be fired.<br /><br />So -- one star for Rowlands and for Garner, and zero stars for the rest of this worthless mess.ing Rachel McAdams in a screen test makes you wonder how awful the other nine actresses who reportedly tried out must have been for her to win this role.

B000OVLBGC|4.0|In Cold War East Germany, a Stasi spy, who at first glance appears to be lacking in humanity, listens in on the lives of playwright Georg Dreyman and his girlfriend, Christa, in an attempt to expose Dreyman as a subversive. In the process, however, the spy finds himself becoming more and more involved in the lives of Georg and Christa.    For the most part, I agree with what other reviewers have said about \\"The Lives of Others\\". Yes, this is a well made film that makes you truly understand what life was like in Cold War East Germany and I was fascinated by the character of Captain Weisler (Ulrich Muhe), the spy who listens in on \\"the lives of others\\". Watching Weisler's humanity bloom over the course of the film is a testament to how well this film is directed and to what a great actor Muhe is. However, for me, this film was let down by the fact that, even after 2 hours, I just didn't feel anything for Georg and Christa and didn't care whether they lived or died. I think this is in part due to the nature of the film. This is a film about voyeurism, and voyeurism is all about watching rather than participating. At the end of the film, I felt like I had watched Georg and Christa, but I didn't feel like I was a part of their lives. Then again, this feeling made me feel like I was in the same place as Capt. Weisler and I understood him all the more because of it.     Overall, this is not my favourite foreign language film of all time, nor is it the best that I have see - I'm not sure if I would have given it the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar if it was up to me. Nevertheless, it is an excellent film and worth watching at least once.

B0000041DZ|3.0|Brendel plays as though the period movement never existed. He plays like he played in the 1960s, insisting that Beethoven MUST have a slow movement in each and every sonata. Take opus 10 #2 in F, specifically the Allegretto movement. Brendel crucufies this movement by playing it dead slowly. Yet Beethoven clearly had in mind a spritely dance-style movement -- otherwise, why mark it \\"Allegretto\\"? But Brendel, self-indulgently, knows better than Beethoven. My own current favorite for the sonatas as a whole is Seymour Lipkin, who at least is able to differentiate between tempi. Kovacevich is also very good. Brendel certainly brings great focus to the music, but sadly he is misguided and, one has to say, blissfully(?) ignorant.

0393327655|4.0|The issues and questions raised by Harris in this excellent book are significant and need to be studied with an open mind and in a spirit of dialogue. Defensiveness and outrage has too frequently been the response from religious readers who find his book disturbing because his arguments are so cogent, urgent and deeply challenging.<br /><br />Disturbing as many religious readers may find Harris's book, it is a book that they need to read over and over again for the following reasons: Believers accept religious beliefs with little question or thought, many religious beliefs are abusive, and God is more often than not depicted in sacred texts as a temperamental, genocidal tyrant. Harris does a first class job of documenting his points from Jewish and Christian scriptures, the Qur'an and Hindu scriptures. Religious beliefs are not beyond the scope of rational discourse, in spite of the fact that many liberals and conservatives seem to believe that they are. Whenever religious leaders make statements like \\"if God does not exist, there is no basis for moral or ethical standards,\\" a claim that is easily refuted, they only prove the point.<br /><br />Harris has other points to make about religion in general and monotheism in particular that religious people need to pay very close attention to. Monotheism, by definition, sets up angry disagreements between people that often end in violence that is sanctioned by sacred texts and promoted by religious and political leaders. To prove his point, Harris makes reference to over one thousand references in Jewish and Christian scriptures that promote religiously sanctioned violence. People who are not associated with our God are called infidels, unbelievers who can be and are frequently killed. Blaise Pascal said way back in the Seventeenth Century that \\"Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction.\\" Sadly this is still all too true, and is all too often promoted by religious and political leaders who appear happy to lead their followers and citizens into the violence of war. And with the weapons available today, this is more dangerous than it has been for a very, very long time.<br /><br />Religious beliefs must be subjected to the same rigorous scrutiny as any other beliefs, and if they make no sense or are abusive, they need to be changed or eliminated. If they make sense, then believers need to show how they make sense, how they are helpful and useful, and how are they practiced.<br /><br />On the subject of deity, Harris sees the concept as unnecessary, and I agree with him, at least insofar as that concept has been defined and described in much of scripture. As he so aptly puts it on page 226 in the paperback edition of his book, \\"we know enough at this moment to say that the God of Abraham is not only unworthy of the immensity of creation; he is unworthy even of man.\\" As blasphemous as this may sound to most religious believers, the statement is true. Think about it, a person described in the terms used to describe God in Jewish scripture, and in the Book of Revelation in Christian scripture would likely be adjudicated as a violent psychopath and jailed or committed to a hospital for the criminally insane.<br /><br />Sam Harris is a very lucid and compassionate man.

B000MGBRHC|5.0|Get down on your hands and knees and pray to the Gods of Metal, Hank Williams, Johnny Cash and hair pomade.  Welcome to the world of Volbeat . Their latest release \\"Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil\\"  is one of those cds that has you feeling baptized by a new sound. As the best thing to come out of Denmark since Hamlet, Volbeat formed in 2001 yet their echo is far more mature on this release than their \\"age\\" would have you thinking.<br /><br />Topping the Danish album charts as the first metal album/ best- selling album, Volbeat `s \\"Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil \\" somehow manages to combine Rockabilly and Metal in such a way that you wonder why it hasn't been done all along.  While the band is as tight as they come, lead singer, Michael Poulsen, has an atypical and astonishing signature tonal quality to his vocals that is a faultless and impeccable instrument for well crafted lyrics and the banjo meets Beelzebub sound that flows through the entire cd. Jon Larsen - Drums, Anders Kjølholm - Bass and Thomas Bredahl on Guitar provide an Anthrax/Metallica barrage of resonance that grabs you from the gut and never sets you free for 11 tracks.<br /><br />And that's ok. You won't want to be released in any case.<br />Finally, \\"Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil\\" is a tour de force that very well may find its place in the Metal Hall of Fame.<br />Johnny Cash and Layne Staley must be proud.<br /><br />Kim<br />[...]

080701429X|5.0|Title says it all. The second half of the book has some really great tips & tricks for life. You shouldn't skip the first half of the book since it ties into and validates the teachings in the second half of the book.     Sometimes the writing is a bit awkward and verbose (he does speak in technical terms at times), but go slow and really try to understand what he's saying. The book is a really quick read, but again take your time!     For a while I really didn't understand this quote from the author: \\"Live as if you were living a second time, and as though you had acted wrongly the first time.\\" But, after taking some time to think about it (like the time you need to read the book), it truly hit home what this quote means.     I'd recommend this book to anyone!

076790592X|5.0|The phrase \\"live every day like it's your last\\" is one that has been recited and repeated for generations; but how many people fully understand its meaning? I myself have to admit that prior to reading Mitch Albom's Tuesdays with Morrie, I was misinterpreting the famous line. Living like it's your last day doesn't mean traveling to some foreign country to skydive for the first time, or embarking on a scuba-diving trip to meet your fear of sharks face to face; what it does mean, as told in Tuesdays with Morrie, is to let go of regrets, to open up your heart to love, and to value relationships above all.     Tuesdays with Morrie is a memoir narrated by Mitch Albom, who in the opening chapters of the book is a materialistic work-a-holic who neglects to contact his favorite college professor (Morrie Schwartz) for sixteen years. It is not until he stumbles upon a \\"Nightline\\" special covering his old professor that Mitch remembers his broken promise. While watching \\"Nightline,\\" he learns that Morrie has been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease and does not have long to live. From this moment on, Mitch decides to fly to Morrie's home every Tuesday to talk with him. These meetings become the pair's final \\"class\\", and grant Mitch the opportunity to rediscover life. While Morrie's road to death is tragic, his acceptance of death and his teachings generate a strong sense of optimism, as he teaches Mitch the true meanings of love, forgiveness, aging, and--in the end--life.      Although he takes a simple, straight-forward approach, Albom's delivery of the story is sentimental and sophisticated. Tuesdays with Morrie is truly a life-changing story that will teach you about the precious gifts of life and how to avoid missing out on them.
B0012GVKW8|1.0|Do not under any circumstances purchase this blu-ray DVD.  Decorum prevents me from using certain unsavory verbage to accurately describe this item but I will try all the same.  Let me put it this way: If you accidentally dropped this DVD on your lawn, flowers would grow there because this DVD is crap.    Let's just put aside the fact that Fox opted not to include any of the extras from the regular DVD release from a few years ago.  Knowing this going in, I bought it anyway thinking that the superior video and audio quality alone would justify the purchase.  Nope.  The picture is appalingly bad.  Fox didn't even bother to clean the print up for the transfer, so all the dust particles and artifacts from the print can now be seen in High Def.  Bravo, Fox.    What's more, Fox is commanding top dollar for this P.O.S.  Suggested retail price is $29.95, a price range reserved for the higher end blu-ray DVD's with superior quality and gobs of extras.  It's barely worth $9.99 and that's being generous.    Avoid this one like the plague.  If someone gives you this DVD, use it as a coaster because it isn't good for much else.  Maybe target practice.  Don't buy COMMANDO either, that one sucks too.     If Fox messes up FIGHT CLUB this badly, I will be royally pissed.  Right now I'm just annoyed.  You are on probabtion, Fox.  Get on the ball or get out of the game.

B0002IQEHI|4.0|Cary Grant has to be the quintessential Hitchcock male (if Grace Kelly is his blonde)!  So suave and charismatic, he is just splendid as the playboy who is mistaken for a government agent.  This mistaken identity (a favorite plot point for Hitch) leads Cary Grant on a cross country journey that culminates in one of the most unforgettable cinematic scenes at Mt. Rushmore.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint is splendid as the double agent helping and bumbling Grant along the way.<br /><br />This is a truly great film: filled with comedy and mayhem, as well as murder and political intrigue.  Anyone could fall in love with this movie.

B0013D8LOU|4.0|Moving a musical from Broadway to the silver screen is not a simple thing. The abhorrent musical [[ASIN:B000E1YVZU Rent]] is a prime example. Although Rent had its place on stage, it suffered with its transition to film due to a shoddy script and even shoddier sets and acting. And although SWEENEY TODD has a similar history, it holds up much better.<br /><br />The first successful element of Sweeney Todd is that it has some really fine actors attached to it, as well as director Tim Burton ([[ASIN:B000C3L27U Corpse Bride]]), the master of dark themes. Not surprising to any, Mr. Burton has brought along Johnny Depp ([[ASIN:B000BB1MI2 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]) whom Mr. Burton has apparently set up as his muse. Since 1990, the two have been practically inseparable, and this has turned out to be advantageous to movie audiences. They work very well together and know each others ins-and-outs. Sweeney Todd also benefitted from the dastardly work of Alan Rickman ([[ASIN:B000W7414C Harry Potter]]) as the devilishly evil Judge Turpin. Rickman has been a favorite of mine since 1988 when he starred alongside Bruce Willis in the first [[ASIN:B000W4HIX6 Die Hard]] film. Another surprising bonus was that of Timothy Spall ([[ASIN:B0011U52EC Enchanted]]) who plays Beadle, the twisted sidekick to Judge Turpin. Although Mr. Spall can't sing very well, he did act the part of Beadle with exceptional creepiness. Then we come to Mr. Burton's other muse, his wife, Helena Bonham Carter ([[ASIN:B000CZ0PT4 Wallace & Gromit - The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]) who plays the female lead of Ms. Lovett. Mrs. Carter is to be commended for her singing abilities, and she apparently took this film very seriously, going so far as to take a barrage of singing and voice lessons in preparation. The sad part about her role is that I found her singing better than her acting. I could easily have seen someone with more acting and singing abilities in her role (for instance Renee Zellweger). But I must give credit where it is due, and I found her acting portions acceptable if a bit flat.<br /><br />The second success is obvious: the music. Stephen Sondheim's score really reached down and pulled this film up a notch. I particularly enjoyed the music and lyrics during the song \\"A Little Priest\\" in which Sweeney Todd (Depp) and Mrs. Lovett (Carter) look out over the London streets and sing about what certain businessmen or people taste like. I found this to be a good section of the film because it incorporated solid acting, a great song, and some darn funny lines/chorus', something not easily achieved in cinema nowadays.<br /><br />The third success is both a positive and a possible negative: the bloodshed. Similar to a Frank Miller graphic, Sweeney Todd is shown in a black-and-white, sepia-toned fashion while the blood of Sweeney's victims is given the royal red treatment (and there's plenty a-gushin' on-screen, too). Although this adds a flare of color to an otherwise dingy look, it also went a bit over-the-top on several occasions. I have to note here, too, the sickening `thud' sound that the bodies make when they are disposed of down Sweeney Toddy's chute and onto the hard cobbles below. This might turn many viewers off so just beware.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier, Mr. Burton is well-known for his dark themes, and I dare say that this is probably the darkest of them all. But the infusion of some much needed comedy helps this one go down a tad easier. Kind of like eating one of Mrs. Lovett's pies and then drinking a nice ale after.<br /><br />Bon app&eacute;tit!redit where it is due, and I found her acting portions acceptable if a bit flat.

B000MXPE88|4.0|Interesting, if disquieting, view of the kind of organization apparently necessary to a nation to stay afloat in today's world:  Situation ethics; disposable loyalties; diverse and highly sophisticated technological tools; unswerving but troubling idealisms; personal costs to participants in anguish and guilt; incremental compromises of original principles; patriotic ruthlessness....  Our eventual realization that both our friends and our enemies have similar organizations, for similar reasons, creates in us, the viewers, a more-in-sadness-than-in-anger awareness that parallel organizations have probably always existed and, of necessity, probably always will.  The film's dialogue is often muffled, oblique, and hard to understand---in keeping with its atmosphere of secrecy---but the viewer thereby tends to lose the detail thread of what's going on at the  moment.  A film to watch several times, but not one where the viewer ends up envying the participants' lives.

0743289692|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali's 'Infidel' evokes comparison with 'The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man', each an eloquent and painful story of a soul yearning to be free, striving to overcome the crushing oppression of totalitarian religion. Hirsi Ali was born into the clan-based culture of 1969 Somalia, a culture that values family and clan honor above all else, in which a daughter is esteemed for her submission to her father, as is a wife to her husband. The theme of submission runs deep in this book. (The word 'Islam' means 'submission'). The ideal woman is one who negates herself for the benefit of others, who passively accepts life inside the 'mental cage' as Hirsi Ali calls it. The brutal and traumatic violence that enforces this culture is described graphically: battered wives, young girls 'sewn shut', rape, 'honor' killings of unmarried women who become pregnant. And, as Hirsi Ali, points out, the tragedy is not limited to the female half of the population: women living in fear of violence in this life as well as of Islam's Hell in the next raise stunted children. But Hirsi Ali was able to survive and eventually flourish in the Netherlands. She gained Dutch citizenship and took up the cause of the rights of Muslim women as a member of parliament. But speaking the truth has cost her dearly: estrangement from her family, and the murder of her friend and collaborator Theo van Gogh, the Dutch filmmaker with whom she made a film about women and Islam. Her book, though, isn't angry. She simply wants others in the Muslim world to search for the truth, recognize it when they find it, and then speak it without fear.
B001E75QGG|1.0|We are now in the 21st Century! Isn't it about time Hollywood puts racist, 19th Century \\"dumb savage\\" stereotypes into the dustbin of history? Why are we still exposed to this kind of crap? It's sickening to pick `on the most vulnerable people in the world. From the Amazon tribes deep inside the rain forest, to the Mbuti (formerly called \\"Pygmies\\") who reside in the vast Ituri located in the Congo, to the aboriginal inhabitants of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands - tribal people are quite real, and they have rich cultures with incredible wisdom & survival skills.<br /><br />They also own, collectively, very valuable land and other natural resources! Something huge transnational corporations and various occupying governments covet to this very day! Even more unbelievable, in this modern day and age, \\"Survival International estimates there are around 100 UNCONTACTED tribes in the world, of which more than half are in the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon.\\" Uncontacted means these tribal people have NEVER been face-to-face with a so-called \\"civilized\\" Western Man or Women, like you, or me!<br /><br />In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the tribal people are obviously guarding their own territory. It's obvious to all concerned, that it's a sacred location! And, it's so ironic! I can only imagine how the Civilized American Citizen would be portrayed if he was attempting to protect New York's Saint Patrick's Cathedral, or the Lincoln Memorial from the intrusion of grave robbers (thieves), like Indiana Jones, or a heavily armed foreign mercenary force out to do no good. He would be portrayed as heroic! But when a tribal person (Red, Yellow, Brown or Black) tries to do the same exact thing, he's an inept, scary buffoon!<br /><br />Unfortunately, these perverted Hollywood stereotypes are the only contact many people have with tribal people. To help change that perception, I highly recommend two international, non-profit organizations: Cultural Survival in the United States & Survival International in the United Kingdom. It's about time the American public no longer tolerates this disgusting form of racism!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00007J71S Cultural Survival Quarterly]] and [[ASIN:B002OTD59S Ishi, the Last Yahi]] and [[ASIN:0199795355 The Rights of Indians and Tribes]]nited States & Survival International in the United Kingdom.

B00005JPS7|5.0|Although not as well known as other Marvel Comic icons as Spiderman or X Men, this film adaptation of Iron Man works due to the sure hand of director Jon Favreau (Swingers, Elf) who cleverly mixes action, drama, humor, and a totally winning performance by comeback actor, Robert Downey Jr.  In terms of a first film showing a superhero's origin, it is the one of the best to date.    Billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is a weapons manufacturer whose cavalier attitude and playboy appetite are matched only by his sheer genius in technology.  On a tour of his weaponry in Afghanistan, he is wounded in the heart by shrapnel and captured by rebels who order him to build a super weapon of mass destruction.  With the help of another civilian, Stark changes up and instead builds a powerful suit of high tech armor that sustains his weak heart and enables his escape but not without a price.  Guilt ridden and traumatized by his experiences, Stark has a literal change of heart and alters the militaristic direction of his company much to the chagrin of his elder partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).  A couple of friends, his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and military liaison, Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), stick loyally by Stark's side despite his earlier predilections.  Intent on improving and perfecting his Iron Man suit, Stark experiments with its design and takes dangerous risks.  His mission is to utilize his Iron Man technology to fight the evil in the world, starting first in Afghanistan.  When the truth comes out about what Stark Industries is really doing with weapons sales, it leads to a deeper conspiracy and a battle of titans as Iron Man meets an old foe.      Buffed and in terrific physical condition, Downey is quite convincing as the prodigy whose initial devil-may-care attitude must undergo a transformation.  (It is not without irony that the role and the person should merge in light of Downey's real life, personal setbacks.)  The movie rests on his shoulders, and he makes the most of his role.  Bridges is great at playing a businessman with a sinister agenda.  Paltrow strikes sparks with Downey and you yearn for more scenes with the two of them.  The same goes for Howard as Stark's best friend.  What is a little hard to swallow is how Pepper and Rhodes could put up with such a pompous persona in the early goings.      Favreau has an amusing bit part as an assistant to Stark.  Further, the robotic voice that assists Stark in his technological work is actor Paul Bettany!  And yes, Stan (the man) Lee, one of the comic book creators, has a fleeting cameo.     The scenes, which show Stark developing his updated Iron Man suit and test-driving it, are realistic and at times amusing.  The Iron Man suit 2.0 is a marvel of construction and is the coolest thing imaginable. There is no way that this concept of a hero could have been rendered as convincingly even a few years ago.  My how movie magic has caught up with these stories finally and done them justice.   It is clever how the film incorporates the original Iron Man design (which brings to mind a sort of poor man's version of Robocop) and progresses through its more modernized version.  Pure fans of the original comic (including myself) are thrilled at the reverence paid to the classic beginnings.      There is an aerial battle between American fighter jets and Iron Man that is a lot of fun.  The special effects, while being among the most realistic and cleverly used in any action film, are well integrated with the strong narrative.  Despite the eye candy, you get the feeling that the filmmakers never lose sight of what the story is about and how to stay focused on the characters.  The pacing is excellent.    In terms of subplots, the Afghan conflict hits close to home with the current war in Iraq.  Also, the secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. gets an introduction as support for Stark and figures to have a bigger role in future Marvel movies; don't forget to stay until the credits are done for a bonus.  The film has an edge about it in dialogue and theme, and is better for it especially in the final scene, which is surprising and has implications for future adventures.     I would put this film on par with Batman Begins and Spiderman, not bad company.  While not as emotionally stirring as the best moments of X Men United or Spiderman 2, this is only the first of what likely will be a long running franchise.  If the sequel can maintain the same quality as this effort, we could be in for the best superhero movie yet!  And lest there be any doubt about Favreau's ability to take on comic heroes, don't worry; he understands what they mean and how to do them justice.  He `get's it'!
B000VRNCGQ|5.0|This is one of the greatest rock recordings of all time.  I know it, critics know it, history has proven it.  Listen to it and you will know it, too.  As for the person who agrees with Clapton that Ginger Baker is the best drummer of all time, sorry.  Baker is good, not great.  Clapton said that in agreement with Baker (who does have the greatest ego of all time), because he was working with him at the time.  Anyone who seriously thinks Baker is the best has apparently never heard Buddy Rich, Keith Moon, Ray Fean, or at least a hundred others.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|The question that begs to be asked is if the latest installment of Indiana Jones is any good? The answer is yes, and one needn't fret over another letdown like The Phantom Menace, which undermined the original Star Wars trilogy.  Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, far from perfect, gets the job done and carries on its tradition of high adventure in satisfying fashion.       In 1957 Nevada, mysterious soldiers persuade Dr. Henry `Indiana' Jones Jr. (Harrison Ford) to locate an important crate amidst a large warehouse of X-Files type of treasures.  A ruthless Russian, Irinia Spalko (Cate Blanchett), leads her troops in an obsessive search for a mythic, crystal skull of unknown origin that may have potential psychic powers if it is joined with other skulls hidden in a lost city in the South American jungle.  Meanwhile at his college, Professor Jones meets young `Mutt' Williams (Shia LaBeouf) who needs Indy's help to rescue his mentor, Dr. Oxley, and his mom, Marion.  It seems they, too, have been hunting for the skull.  Pursued by Russian agents, Indiana and Mutt attempt to rescue their comrades while discovering clues about the crystal skull.  During the journey, certain truths emerge, and Indy must confront his past and a former love.  As Irina closes in, who will survive when the enigmatic skulls are reunited and unleash their hidden, unworldly power?    The screenplay by David Koepp cobbles previous stories and ideas from a battery of writers.  While it has more heart than any Lara Croft film by far, one wishes that original writer, Lawrence Kasdan, had a final rewrite to punch up the emotional content to compliment the action.  I do like, however, that they tease you with the possibility that Mutt may or may not be Indy's son and if Indy will `get the girl'.  Bravo to the filmmakers for confronting these issues head on by story's end.      Harrison Ford may be 65 years of age, but he looks great and does most of his own stunts! (To put things in perspective, John Wayne was 62 in True Grit and Cary Grant was 59 in Charade.) Shia LaBeouf is more than able as his new sidekick with a greased comb and an attitude, and Karen Allen is most welcome as Marion, able to take charge and hold her own.  Cate Blanchett is appropriately sinister and alluring as the deadly Irina.  Unfortunately other talents are not well developed, leaving in its lurch, John Hurt as Oxley, Jim Broadbent as a college dean, and Ray Winstone as an older sidekick with his own agenda.    While Raiders of the Lost Ark had countless, memorable action scenes, this film has a few of its own.  There are the usual barrage of bloodless shootouts, fistfights, and bits of customary nastiness with bugs, snakes and skeletons not to mention the exciting climax where you just know the greedy, evil commies will get theirs.  Naturally, some of the scenes strain credibility in being quite implausible and unrealistic (as in plunging from a waterfall or two or three), but it is all in good fun. The hair raising escapes are like a well oiled machine particularly in an exhilarating but impossible chase in the jungle as major characters leap among three, count `em three moving vehicles!  And if it feels like parts of the story seem familiar, keep in mind that the filmmakers are paying homage to the Saturday morning serials of their youth.  Other referenced movies come to mind like Forbidden Planet and Journey to the Center of the Earth.      Production values are top notch. Veteran composer John Williams rekindles the musical cues, and Michael Kahn's editing pushes the limits of nail biting suspense.  A couple scenes look a little sloppy and don't come off as well as they should, and although there are some slow spots with confusing dialogue and murky exposition, there is always a marvelously choreographed action scene waiting around the corner.  For example, the opening sequence is vintage Indiana Jones as Spielberg builds up a grand entrance for his star and puts him in immediate peril.  Later, there is an anxious moment when Jones is about to be caught in an atomic blast and must use his wits to survive.  What has always made the character so likeable is that he is fallible.  Even Indy's mistakes and hiccups can be humorous and exciting, as evidenced in a sinking pit where he must come to grips with a childhood fear.     Lucas and Spielberg proved that lightning could strike three times in a row in the 1980's (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, and The Last Crusade), and now they have done it a fourth time.  I put this film on par with the later chapters.  Viewers who keep in mind how the 1950's timeline lends itself to more science fiction elements, will understand that, while every Indy saga ends with a supernatural event, this one is grounded in the `watch the skies' frame of mind.  It is this conceit that may throw off a few fans of the older films.      The door is left open for more adventures, but the film does wrap things in a neat bow. You wish that they would just leave well enough alone and gracefully end on a high note. Indeed, the last, parting shots are terrific for fans.  As with the previous chapters, this film is likely to improve with repeated viewings.  I seem to recall liking the first one and then savoring it considerably more over time.  Indiana Jones ages like fine wine.  Drink up.
0810994739|3.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid is not a diary but, in fact, a journal or \\"novel in cartoons.\\" It covers one school year in the life of a geeky middle-school-aged boy named Greg, especially antics involving his equally unpopular friend, Rowley. The book is unique in format, but filled with Captain Underpants-like humor in its anecdotes about things the (mostly unsuccessful) quest for cool at school, friendship, and family. Certain parts, notably a standardized thank you note and an attempt at setting up a haunted house, were entertaining, but parents of younger readers might not be thrilled with bullying as a recurring theme and a handful of inappropriate words like \\"jerk,\\" \\"sissy,\\" \\"moron,\\" and \\"dork,\\" which make the nine to twelve year old recommended reading level seem appropriate. And although my favorite nine-year-old bookworm raced through it (and the sequel) and then started in on the first one again after requesting two milk bottles filled with sand and a stick, I was never able to muster more than a smile during the time (less than an hour) it took to get through it. From this reader's (adult) perspective, it's overrated, but to each his own. Similar: Dav Pilkey's Captain Underpants series. For adults: Dave Sedaris' Me Talk Pretty One Day. Better: The Dangerous Book for Boys by Hal Iggulden.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|I am angry about people giving this CD more than one star, because it doesn't even deserve one star.  The many good reviews gave me the dumb idea to buy the CD.  Obviously, most of your reviewers don't have very discriminating tastes in music.  After all these years, and having JT, Timbaland, and Kanye, she couldn't do better than this?  Next time I buy a CD, I am going to be sure to sample it first.  Ashlee Simpson or some other pop tart could put out a better dance CD than this.

B0015519VS|5.0|After a four year hiatus, Usher returns with one of the best mainstream R&B CD's of the year. Just as Usher as grown and changed as a man so has his music, which is a great thing in my opinion. Stand out tracks on the CD for me were Love You Gently,Something Special, Prayer For You and the title track. The not so great one for me is Moving Mountians which is one of the worst songs he's ever recorded. My detatiled review can be found below.    1. Intro - This is a basic Usher intro where he sets up the vibe of the album.  2. Love In This Club featuring Young Jeezy - Unless you've been living under a rock you've heard this song.      3. This Ain't Sex - Another one of my personal favorite tracks. Even though it's a throwback to his My Way days, it has a Michael Jackson Rock With You type feel as it's just a feel good track about dancing.    4. Trading Places - (written by The- Dream and produced by Tricky Stewart): A hot slow jam similar to Can You Handle It. This is one of personal favorite tracks as it shows Usher's fully matured tenor.  5. Moving Mountains - The second single still confuses me every time I hear it. The Dream gives me his first disappointment as a writer and Tricky Stewart gives us a mediocre beat. I think this is one of the worst songs Usher has ever recorded.  6. What's Your Name featuring will.i.am - This is an ok track, however it sounds better suited for Craig David. Will I Am gives a catchy beat as always but the vocals aren't really special.     7. Prayer For You Interlude - With the impending birth of my own son, I can really identify with Usher and there's nothing stronger than the bond between a father and son.       8. Something Special - This song reminds of walking in the park with my wife and making our way to a picnic. It has a laid back summer feel to it and reminds of a seventies Stevie Wonder.  9. Love You Gently - Now this is the Usher I like to hear. Love You Gently is easily on par with Nice & Slow, Twork It Out and Can U HandleIt as Usher's throwback to Bobby Brown's Roni & Rock Witcha. I can easily see this being his \\"concert song\\" when he tours.  10. Best Thing featuring Jay Z - Nothing too special a standard my girl left me track and I want her back. Usher doesn't over sing on this track or under sing and I highly doubt it'll be a single even with the stamp of the Jigga man. It doesn't really go with the Vibe of the new CD and would have fared better on his previous CD.  11. Before I Met You - This is an ok song, nothing to special and Usher kind of under sings it. Basically he's talking about how his life has changed since he met his current girlfriend and he refuses to go back to his old ways.      12. His Mistakes a.k.a. I Can't Win- (Produced by Stargate & written by Ne-Yo) - This can basically be described as Can't Help But Wait Part 2. Usher's strong vocals make the song work; however with the riffs being similar to the Trey Songz hit it's nothing really impressive.     13. Appetite - Appetite is kind if the red headed step child to Before I Met You. Even though he's a happily married man and in love he's still a man who loves the ladies.    14. What's A Man To Do - This song has some truth to it and Usher's vocals make it work since the beat isn't to promising. Usher is one of the few singers who can sing anything and he'll sound good as he does with this song. This is another song that would have gone better on the Confessions CD.      15. Lifetime - Usher's little brother J-Lack continues to show he's a wonder kid when it comes to making beats and this is a nice mid tempo ballad.     16. Love In This Club Part II featuring Beyoncé & Lil Wayne - A great remix tops the original and Love In The Part II does just that. Truth be told Usher should have released this version as the lead single instead.  17. Here I Stand - Just like Can U Help Me, Separated and Burn before it, Here I Stand is Usher's big ballad on the CD. Here I Stand may upset some female fans as it's a testament to his love for his wife but it's one of my favorite songs on the CD and Usher has never sounded so strong vocally.  18. Will Work For Love (Produced by J.R.Rotem) - Usher easily sings this feel good track and while the chorus can get annoying this songs seems better suited for Akon.   Usher recorded upwards of sixty songs for the CD and some of the tracks such as The Realest feat. Jermaine Dupri, Lights Camera Action feat. Nelly, and At The Time featuring T-Pain were cut and remain unheard. However the tracks mentioned below can be found on the web, import versions of the CD and mixtaspes.    CUT TRACKS & Bonus Tracks  Flash - (Produced by The Neptune's) - A horrid sounding track from the once reliable Neptune's which didn't make the album. The Neptune's and Usher had amazing chemistry on his 8701 CD, however they strike out this time.  Echo -This is one of the best tracks from Bryan Michael Cox that was cut. The song reminds me of Alexander O Neal's Hearsay.    Play Me - (Produced by the Avilla Brothers) - This is a winner that won't be on the initial release of the album, however it's rumored to be on the re-release. The Avilla Brothers who produced That's What's It Made For, from the Confessions CD, give Usher another winner in this track. I don't know how it would fare in the states but in the UK (where I used to DJ) I could easily see the Brits liking this track with its techno driven beat.    Dat Girl Right There - (produced by Rich Harrison) - The third time isn't the charm for Luda and Usher on this track. This song seems better suited for Day26 or Omarion as Usher vocals are to strong for this track and Luda's verse is second rate at best. The beat from Rich Harrison is also a huge disappointment as he's known for Go Go styled drum beats.    Just Like Me -  Another song that doesn't really go with the grown man vibe Usher was going for on This CD. It's basically talking about how Usher and his girl are both doing dirt and I'm happy it didn't make the finalcut.    Forever Young - This is a longer version of the intro.    Revolver - No thoughts really on this song it's just another song.    All in all a fine album and this is easily one of the best mainstream R&B albums along with Mariah Carey's E=MC2 to be released in 2008. Usher has once again claimed his throne as one of the kings of modern R&B and shows he's not ready to give up the throne yet.

From 8701 to Confessions and now Usher has shown more growth with a wonderful CD that will no doubt be a classic.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|Truth be told, the latest Indiana Jones installment, nineteen years after the last, is fine, rollicking popcorn entertainment and not nearly the major disappointment some critics would lead you to believe. It may not compete with [[ASIN:B00005JPS7 Iron Man]] in terms of story freshness or [[ASIN:B000UR9T8C Spider-Man 3]] for state-of-the-art CGI effects, but I never felt producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg had much more on their combined minds than updating the outrageous derring-do of the Saturday afternoon matinee serials of the 1930's and 40's. With the predominant use of traditional stunt work and pyrotechnics, the 2008 film represents old-fashioned escapism at its purest and falters only when the convoluted plot gets in the way, which is quite often, especially in the exposition-heavy first half. Fortunately, the veteran hands keep the high-spirited adventure afloat over its 123-minute running time, even though it never quite achieves the breathlessly excitement of the original [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Raiders of the Lost Ark]], an inevitable fate for all the sequels.<br /><br />Written by David Koepp ([[ASIN:B00003CXAT Jurassic Park]]), the overcrowded story is set at the height of the Cold War in 1957, as the aging Jones finds himself captured by a group of Russian soldiers in legendary Area 51 out in the Nevada desert. Headed by Colonel Irina Spalko, a severely mannered doctor with psychic abilities, they force him to find a crate with the remains of an extraterrestrial inside (shades of [[ASIN:B000A2IPP0 E.T.]]). This leads to a terrifically energetic warehouse fight sequence that quickly reassures us that the filmmakers have not forgotten what the chief lure of the series is. Jones next manages to escape a nuclear test blast through creative means, at which point the movie calms down with the professor back at Marshall College. Forced to leave the university due to an FBI investigation, Jones meets a young motorcycle greaser named \\"Mutt\\" Williams, who tells him that his old colleague Harold Oxley is lost in the Peruvian jungle looking for the mysterious crystal skull.<br /><br />Once in Peru in the film's last hour, the action brings all the characters together, including Spalko and her soldiers, on a maddening chase for not only the skull but the secret temple from which it came. In the middle of the morass is Jones' old love and Mutt's mother, the still-feisty Marion Ravenwood. There's a wildly enjoyable chase scene on the edge of a steep cliff that has everything thrown in - a rapid-fire machine gun on a turret, fanciful swordplay, wine-swinging, aggressive howler monkeys, and an army of man-eating red ants. The last scenes bring the science fiction aspect into focus with Spielberg in familiar territory, and I have to admit that a lot of the climactic excitement is undercut by too many characters that are relatively incidental to the action at hand. Throughout the film, you'll see winking tributes to Lucas' [[ASIN:078322737X American Graffiti]] and Spielberg's [[ASIN:B00006ADD4 Close Encounters of the Third Kind]].<br /><br />At 65, Harrison Ford wears his age well, meeting the physical demands of the role head-on, and what comes across is a smart actor who innately understands the mythic qualities of his character while having fun with the outlandish situations he faces in quick succession. It's great to see Karen Allen, still with her wide, infectious smile, come back as Marion, but other than a few toss-off lines and her character's gutsy driving skills, she is given little to do this time. An actress as vibrant as Allen should be used for more than nostalgic purposes. As Spalko with her harsh Louise Brooks-style bob and using a bit of the Dietrich accent she used in [[ASIN:B000OY8NBK The Good German]], Cate Blanchett is obviously having a good time playing a military dominatrix with equal parts Garbo in [[ASIN:B0009S4IJW Ninotchka]] and Natasha Fatale, Boris' taller half. My only complaint is that thefilmmakers don't make Spalko evil enough to be truly as menacing as Blanchett could be.<br /><br />As the obvious successor to the series, Shia LeBeouf plays the cocksure \\"Mutt\\" as a young Brando wannabe (circa [[ASIN:0767818172 The Wild One]]), but he lacks the genuine swagger and dangerous edge to make the character more than a plot device to attract younger viewers. Ray Winstone as the loyalty-shifting Mac, John Hurt as Oxley, and Jim Broadbent as Jones' fellow academic all play their smaller roles with their usual &eacute;lan, although I wish each one was given more opportunity to shine here. On the upside, John Williams' heroic music score is intact, and cinematographer Janusz Kami&ntilde;ski does a nice job succeeding Douglas Slocombe in picking up on the look of the previous films. The movie is just a little too busy to be a complete home run for the series, but it should satisfy long-time fans who have clamored for Indy's return. Judged from that perspective, it succeeds.palko evil enough to be truly as menacing as Blanchett could be.
