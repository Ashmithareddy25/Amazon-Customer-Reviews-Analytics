B008FYZIVY|5.0|I had missed the first three seasons and wanted to get caught up before season 4 starts. I immediately got so caught up in it that I watched it every minute I had available. I ordered season 3 as well. In retrospect, I should have ordered all three seasons together. Special note to men: My husband (a sports &#34;jock&#34;) did not like watching it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Best book ever I thought it had a lot of action u should read it its amazing<br />Love it yes
0374531269|4.0|Great great book. Easy to read but not so easy to imagine. Great work and very emotional. I definitely recommend.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I would recommend this game because I like games that challenge your mind and this one is challenging but enjoyable to play.
B00847KFDS|5.0|The song selection was great and the performers that John selected were great except for one. I am just not a Kid Rock fan and when Born on the Bayou plays I usually just skip it. If you are a KR fan, though, I imagine you would love it.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|How can you complain? I can select the news sources I want and they're available when I want it. It's no wonder papers and magazines are having problems.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Great insight into the life of probably America's greatest inventor.  A worthy read.  This is easy reading and at a good price.
B00AA0U05A|2.0|I was very disappointed in this production.<br />I had expected great stuff after watching her on a TV morning show.<br />I would not recommend this item.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|As a former fighter pilot who wanted a watch with that military issue look, this is it. Since its an automatic you have to deal with it stopping if not wearing it all the time but that's a minor nuisance. A heck of a watch for the price.
B0019M06JS|4.0|I found this cd to be different and relaxing.<br />We play it while entertaining folks for an outdoor dinner.<br />Her voice is nice to relax to with with a glass of wine and good company.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Very interesting movie. Although, knowing there is a book out there, I'm thinking it wasn't as detailed and in depth as it could have been. However, knowing that movies can't really add up to a book it was very nicely put together.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|It is what it is.  A re-write.  Having said that it is the best re-write I have ever seen.  I grew up on the original Star Trek series.  So this storyline has always been my favorite.  Now there are some issues with believability both in the story and the science.  It is not perfect as a movie.  Of course, neither was the original tv series.  I do have a real ratings scale of 10 that I use for advising someone of whether the movie is worth it or not.  I give this movie a 9.  It is possible to enjoy this movie if not a fan and if a fan, is a must on putting it in one's movie library.
057506885X|5.0|A true must read but whatever you do get the hard bound copy because the illistrations are so much a part of the story.
B0026S93C0|3.0|The actresses were very talented in their dancing but the story jumped around quite a bit it was a slow to involve movie
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable solved my charging issues. I am now able to charge my kindle quickly and use it more often.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I really enjoy the story line wasnt so keen on the way it ended , was left abit in the air one can only sumise how their lives would have turned out , but enjoy all the twists....
B005PK57IK|5.0|I really like this show. I think it is a balanced show with a bunch of different characters. And I am from the upper Midwest which makes it even more appealing to me.
B00BD62X14|5.0|This album is on my top by Crala Bruni, First heard of it on Sunday Morning on CBS. I play this over and over while cleaning the house, The sound is great on a Bowes CD player very loud. Love it
140006922X|5.0|This was a very informative and interesting book. It is not in the same league as S. G. F. Brandon's &#34;Jesus and the Zealots&#34;, but it is an easier read and has a wealth of references to further sources of information..
B006VRDZ44|5.0|The writing is superb, better almost than Mad Men, and the acting is terrific. The set design, attention to detail and recreation of prohibition era New York, Atlantic City and Chicago is amazing. The characters take a bit to warm up to, but they are wonderfully complex, compelling and interesting.
0812982622|5.0|This is  a gem of a book.  I just did not want it to end, the writing is perfect. The characters are so real and the information about North Korea is amazing.  I wish there were more books like it. I loved it!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was a great book, she grabs you into the book with all the suspense, action, and details. Susan Collins did a great book
B007I6GCT2|5.0|10/10 for this movie.<br />The product looks brand new and it was at a good price for a 3-Disc Digital Copy.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app is awesome! I got it when it was the free app of the day.Totally worth the money though.You can pick multiple colored papers including designs.Paint, crayons, markers, colored pincels, stickers, and stamps.It looks really realistic too.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Not much to say, it's a good movie with a good plot.  Mission Impossible is a great series and this follows suit.
B005XQLBU4|2.0|Just another game to waste time with, the graphics are ok but the story is very thin<br />This game will not keep me interested for long
B008469DGY|5.0|I got this game on as the free app of the day, and I am really impressed. The game is simple yet addictive, and has great engineering. Works great on my Samsung galaxy s3.
1423136802|5.0|My 8 year old was having problems engaging with books, but since he got these books he is carrying the box with all of them around and telling me all about every chapter, his siblings are eager to read them as well. For me this was a hit, I my read them myself.<br /><br />My kids are 8 and 9
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I love this movie! A great heart-warming tale about family and learning to accept your loved ones. Lots of imagination and creativity. A great story with so much heart! I would (and do) recommend this movie to everyone. It really is my favorite movie!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love that this movie is child appropriate and promotes good family values and fatherhood. At the same time, it's charmingly funny in it's special sinister way. I don't know anyone who doesn't like Dispicable Me and I can't wait to catch the sequel.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|The story is a bit dark, but given today's headlines; very possible.  The voice of a five year old as narrator was fascinating.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the story line and actors. We watch this over and over. Love the sets too. This is a good drama.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Didn't work well at all, it kept freezing which then required me to have to restart my Kindle Fire, I uninstalled it.
B004M1MHMM|5.0|I bought this to finally transfer my last remaining vinyl albums to iTunes.  I did not find that the supplied software was very good at all. So, I used a program I already own.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|The animals and flowers in this set are super cute.  My kids love them and play with them often. Great buy.
B007NZQU72|4.0|This is a great book to read for sensitive people to understand themselves.  Well, at least the first couple chapters.  Then it gets all smaltzy and rewords the same ideas.<br /><br />Still, worth reading for the sensitive person.
B007SGM084|5.0|Friends recommended these books to me. They said they had a difficult time putting it down. I am glad I waited till my vacation to read. Eccentric and sensual.
B000ICZD4I|4.0|I love this movie. I've watched it so many times, but I never get tired of the great acting by Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates. Having been raised in the South, I understand the culture and customs. This movie is a classic.
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|I saw this tour in the day and the live concert discs are what I bought it for.<br />I vividly remember Allman shouting 1-2-3-4 and Wasted Words. Now that's hitting the note, that's rock and roll!<br />Perfectly captured for my money.<br />Outtakes are interesting and the original album sounds great.<br />Other reviewers have expressed pretty much else I would say.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Absolutely a must see for any fan of rock and roll or the recording industry. Dave Grohl's personal involvement in the story is the icing on the cake.  Beautifully done.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I may not be well read but I read a lot. The Fault in Our Stars is the best literature I have had the pleasure of taking in.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed the book... it is a fast read.  I particularly enjoyed the author's point of view, based on his training as a medical doctor.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|How can one not enjoy a Ken Follett book?  I didn't realize he had written this altho I was familiar with the title.  Amazon can be assured I  will purchase anything at all if Follett is the author.
B00DX88GWU|5.0|This is a fantastic live release that any fan of Kreator should absolutely have.  It<br />has a total of 24 songs spanning all eras of the band's career, which should immediately<br />grab the interest of anyone who listens to these guys.  What makes it an automatic<br />purchase is the SOUND.  Man, do these old thrashers know how to get it done, or what?  If<br />you need proof, listen to the back-to-back assault of \\"Endless Pain\\" and \\"Pleasure to Kill\\",<br />then try to tell me I'm wrong.  Mille and company are so freakin' tight, and really don't sound<br />any different from their early days other than the increased diversity worked into their<br />mid-career material, not to mention the incredible mastery of songwriting they've accomplished<br />in their recent years.  The newest album, \\"Phantom Antichrist\\", gets special emphasis here since<br />they were touring for it at the time of the recording, which is just fine, as that album shows<br />incredible maturity and focus on dynamics within songs.  The production on the CD is just as great<br />as the track list.  You really couldn't ask for a much more clear and powerful sound on a live<br />album.  While it would make better sense to get the DVD version that also has the two CD's,<br />this would be a good option if you don't need to see the show since it's priced lower.  Whichever<br />version you're looking at, if you like Kreator, you need to get one of them.  Very, very<br />recommended.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I did like the character James so I kept on reading to see how his life panned out. I started the book twice. It is a slow read with a very satisfying ending. I found the child cruelty scenes from the orphanage overdone. I enjoyed the touches oh humor.
B00DGL3IKY|5.0|All the material that comes with this DVD set is listed in Amazon's description, so there's<br />no need to repeat all that here.  The deal with \\"Dying Alive \\" is that it's a fantastic live<br />release that any fan of Kreator should absolutely have.  It has a total of 24 songs spanning all<br />eras of the band's career, which should immediately grab the interest of anyone who listens to these<br />guys.  What makes it an automatic purchase is the SOUND.  Man, do these old thrashers know how to<br />get it done, or what?

The production on the DVD and CD's  is just as great as the track list.  You really couldn't<br />ask for a much more clear and powerful sound on a live release.  If you don't need to see the show,<br />there's also a 2-CD version that's a bit lower priced.  Whichever version you're looking at, if you like<br />Kreator, you need to get one of them.  Very, very recommended.
B004GNYGTI|5.0|I already said I loved it.  I already said I loved it.  I already said I loved it.  I already said I loved it.<br /><br />I am angered that you make me fill this crap out to tell you I already loved it after I already told you I loved it.  I will never communicate with you again.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|It was actually a bit boring. To different from the series. I enjoyed the series much more. Look forward to season two.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Staying connected on a busy life is empowering. Great topic choices as well. Being able to search for information quickly in the palm of my hand is a reward in itself. A great app to have
B000AP04FG|4.0|Very fun and entertaining, what else to ask,  it's the movie stars amongst many other good ones, cool and fun scenario!
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|I think its bad because as I'm reading the comments it say crashes shutting down on their devices why should I get this if it does this comment sense
B0049MAXQG|5.0|Spooky, good vs evil..  This is the kind of movie that messes with your head. Love it!  Kept me up at night.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Classic, beautiful, natural and raw rock n roll recordings from the man in the picture. Very enjoyable and profound pieces from 1969 to 1971. The crude recording of those tunes combined with the strong stories and lyrics make them quite powerful because they impregnate the emotion with a scent such that hits you strong to the heart. Maybee that is why this songs here are more vivid recordings and better than the original Sel Portrait album, because they are more naturally etched. I mean, the impact of the emotion conveyed in every song here is a thrill reflected, and that is art of music. The day I bought it on the store last week, the cashier asked me, \\"are you a bootleg collector?\\" And I very humbly replied, \\"no, I just enjoy the music\\". Maybee a lot of people are collecting this tapes witch is good. But I suggest you listen because Bob Dylan is like a gift from God to us. To remind us the beauty behind every present moment in this world many times harsh to us. In Another Self Portrait, Bob gives life and a new meaning to these songs. Tomorrow there is a \\"New Morning\\" awaiting for you full of songs of yesterday to help you get past through the day. Great songs...
B009MJUB7W|3.0|I love Schleich toys - they are sturdy and the detail in them is wonderful. But....this panther is so small!! From the picture I was envisioning something larger - I guess I need to pay more attention to the measurements listed. My grandson loves panthers and I thought this would be a good addition to his play animals but it's much smaller than his other animals.<br />I'll keep it but will continue to look for animals that are a little bigger.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Okay. The headline is cheesy. This film is not.<br />It's two films in one: a respectful & insightful retrospective of the original Sound City, harking back to a place & time (1970s) in the valley North of L.A. and Hollywood. Then using a behind-the-scenes approach to making new music, we see an album of new songs with collaborating artists & technicians & the central 'piece' of the film, a unique sound board, the Neve.<br />Throughout, we are treated to a delicacy in music film, a thread of a story, that includes insights woven into a contextual weave where music is constantly, reverentially at the epicenter.<br />The various persons who contributed and made the difference, past and present. Not without some pains and pangs of emotion. ... it captures the collaboration of equipment, the arc of technological innovations & adoption of such ... it relishes the usually unseen contributions giving honor and respect to those often neglected or forgotten ... it highlights the creative process.<br />Several key artists in bringing together some very good original music in the new studio with the old Neve board that played such a critical role in the former.<br />It genuinely captures what was going on in rock 'n' roll at that time, through to the present day 2012 - the surge of creativity playing (against) with the commercial drivers of the times.<br />You'll want to read the credits and purchase the album.<br />What ultimately comes across is a very human depiction. We get to see these artists at work and how they operate. Surprisingly effective is the combination with Paul McCartney, just as one example, Characterized by this exchange as the tune comes together by virtue of the easy interplay of musicians, the producer(s), and their various roles in bringing it together.<br />Dave Grohl: It should always be this easy!<br />Paul McCartney: Yup! It usually is.<br />What ultimately comes across to the view (listener) is the joy of the music.<br />Dave Grohl starts early inthe film by revealing his way at creating the song: get the drum line down, and then build from there. By the end his journey discovering the story of this documentary seems to come through what he's learned and enjoyed through the collaborations with other solid artists. Rare is a documentary that demonstrates an open mind to its topic where we get to stretch and grow along with its filmmakers. A treat.<br />Thank you Dave Grohl for reaching us through this multi-generational love song for music!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|More please!  I LOVE these books! I want more please and soon! Sylvia Day is amazing! I read the 3 books in just a few days....I am addicted and I need more! 10 stars still aren't enough!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Since our family has only owned Apple products and we have such an appreciation for the products' design and capabilities, I wanted to read this book.  I am so glad I did.  Steve Jobs is one of those people who will never come again.  I have such respect for him because his products are perfect.  Made in America and have such high quality.  Thank you for telling us how great he was.  B  Nelson
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a good Sci Fi/Western series to watch.  Very original show that I would recommend to anyone to watch for the fun of it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I love this book, not just for the excitement of the sexual spiciness, but the leaving you on edge with not knowing what will happen next.  I am truly enjoying this and looking forward to book # 3.<br />Yes, I highly recommend this book.<br />Good read.
B0055V6EZE|1.0|bought this with his other c.d. expecting smooth jazz, got something very depressing in more ways than one. I mean it.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This movie hits well above it's class, and is much better than the campy 'one-building siege' premise suggests. As an action movie it delves into issues of poverty, corruption, and powerlessness, while offering a well-pace balance of suspense and brutality. I went into movies like Pacific Rim and the Lone Ranger, really wanting to like them, but ended up disappointed. Dredd was a great surprise and a very solid action movie.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|Good book but I had it figured out about the women but not the FBI agent. Enjoyed the story .
0307913090|5.0|I started as a fan of the HBO TV series and figured I would start listening to the books in audio form to get the full fan experience. I liked going into this book having an idea of what the characters looked like. It made it easier for me to picture the world as described. Roy Dotrice does an excellent job with voicing each character. If anyone is intimidated to read 800 + pages, the audiobook is the way to go. I feel I know each person a little bit better because the producers can't fit everything from the book into the show. I'm going to start A Clash Of Kings immediately. I can't wait to hear more.
B007XIO9TU|5.0|JOHNNY WINTER LIVE FROM JAPAN (DVD)<br />©Marc Wickert [...]<br /><br />What an incredibly powerful performance from this legendary bluesman and his rock-solid accompanying band.  BAM!  If you only ever purchase one music DVD this is the one to buy.<br /><br />The show kicks off Chicago-blues style with an intro by the pedigree Johnny Winter Band, with highly-respected guitarist Paul Nelson grabbing some solo neck before Johnny shuffles onstage, offloading pure R'n'B (rhythm and blues - not that latest crap) licks from his Erlewine Laser guitar, a brand he's been using since 1984.  He's sporting one of his traditional Texan cowboy hats and sits upfront like Merlin whipping up a tempest.  Johnny Winter must be the most powerful man on the planet!<br /><br />This is a trip - a ride down the Blues Highway - as Winter and his rockin' cohorts head for the Crossroads of 61 and 49 whilst summoning up the spirits of such masters as Muddy, Robert and Elmore.<br /><br />Freddie King's Hideaway rolls out next and the band are as tight as a fish's ...  Johnny introduces the group's rhythm section: Vito Liuzzi on Pearl drums and vocals, and Scott Spray on Yamaha bass.  Both members of the `Blues Beret Special Forces' provide tasty solo teasers before general play resumes.  It's probably around now that the younger ones in the audience ask, \\"Hey Dad, what are those cables doing coming out of their guitars?\\"<br /><br />Winter's solos have always been uniquely melodic and thought out: He doesn't just dispatch a load of scales or boring notes, but takes his listeners on an exciting journey each time.  Johnny also mixes in tribute riffs, such as Jimi Hendrix's Third Stone From The Sun, Jack Bruce's Sunshine Of Your Love, and even a bit of Peter Gunn.<br /><br />Johnny Winter's career started when he was knee high to a Beaumont grasshopper, practising after school on his guitar for six to eight hours a night, always employing the thumb-picking style he picked up from bluegrass performer Merle Travis.<br /><br />Sugar Coated Love (not mentioned on the track listings), and She Likes To Boogie Real Low immediately follow.  There are no pauses in this delivery - the band delivers a shock-awe blasting, not letting the stunned audience recover from this staggering assault.  This is a hard-working band and it's impossible to stop your feet tapping along.<br /><br />They rip into Good Morning Little School Girl, a song Johnny did on his debut Johnny Winter album.  Then there's the Got My Mojo Working tribute to Muddy Waters, a man Winter played and produced for on four of his albums - three becoming Grammy winners.<br /><br />Johnny's solos are so slick, it's no wonder Jimi loved to jam with him, sometimes strapping on a bass to let Winter have some neck!  Paul Nelson lays down great accompanying lead; Vito Liuzzi machineguns the skins and provides backing vocals; whilst Scott Spray bends his bass strings, adds vocals (without a mic) and practises his dance steps.<br /><br />These guys are smokin' and there's no way Johnny's going to let the crowd, who have been rocking on their feet since the intro, sit down.  So they tear into Chuck Berry's Johnny B. Goode, a tune from Second Winter.<br /><br />It's not until Ray Charles's Black Jack that Johnny eases off the throttle for some slow blues, and yet the Tokyo audience remains on their feet and amped to the eyeballs. What an incredible impact the Johnny Winter Band is having!<br /><br />Tore Down - Vito gives Winter's vocal chords a rest and somehow the song seems to take on a Carl Perkins twist.  Not sure if it's the All Tore Down tune from the Still Alive and Well album - only the titles sound similar, but it's a lot of fun anyway.<br /><br />Johnny gets back vocal duties for Lone Wolf (from I'm A Bluesman), which runs right into Don't Take Advantage Of Me (from Guitar Slinger), with the song grinding into the Stone's Gimme Shelter. OMG - these guys are brilliant!  It feels like they've been playing together since 1066; everything just flows.<br /><br />It was important that Johnny blast back with so much pure, crisp guitar work on this DVD after the video Johnny Winter Live In Times Square was released years ago, contrary to Winter's wishes.  This `Guitar Slinger' is truly one of the greatest axe grinders of all time.  His poor ranking on Rolling Stone's top 100 is far more of an embarrassment to the magazine than it is to Johnny Winter.<br /><br />Bony Moronie (off Saints and Sinners) rolls out next.  It's like the truck Dean Moriarty hitched a ride on in Kerouac's On The Road: There are no stops!  For Womack and Womack's It's All Over Now, the Stone's working is adopted, but with a bit more grunt.  Finally, Winter spots an aglu and the band comes up for air.<br /><br />The audience demands an encore and the band are happy to please.<br /><br />Johnny Winter makes a bold statement here - not only is he Still Alive And Well, but he's cooler than ever.  It's appropriate that the born-again bluesman close the show with his '64 Firebird Gibson, having resurrected his career from the flames just like the Phoenix.  A lot of credit here goes to executive producer Paul Nelson who has done so much to help Winter get back on the horse and accompanies Johnny on lead and rhythm in a fashion Keith Richards refers to as \\"guitar weaving\\".<br /><br />Winter always plays slide on one of his Firebirds.  He first heard the slide guitar being played on the radio by Muddy Waters and tried running all sorts of household items up and down his guitar strings, attempting to capture that same sound, before buying 12 feet of plumber's pipe and sawing a piece off it each time a `slide' wore out.  Wonder how much of the pipe is left?<br /><br />Johnny and the band hammer home Robert Johnson/Elmore James's Dust My Broom and Bob Dylan's Highway 61 with unrelenting power and passion.  What a way to close a show.  Long live the King of slide guitar! We've just been transported down the lengthof the Blues Highway.<br />In 1969, Johnny Winter conducted the Progressive Blues Experiment - now he's back with the stunning results.<br /><br />Johnny Winter Live From Japan is a Mind-Blowing DVD.  It would be nice to see the `Guitar Slinger' and this same band return with a follow-up DVD comprising all Johnny Winter compositions: \\"I'm Yours, I'm Hers; White Line Blues, Mean Town Blues; Rock And Roll...<br /><br />For more on Johnny Winter [...]<br /><br />For Mary Lou Sullivan's Johnny Winter autobiography, Raisin' Cain [[ASIN:0879309733 Raisin Cain Raucous Johnny Winter]]
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This can is great and especially when your bored and you need something to do, and great to compete with your friends.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|...my opinion is definitely biased because of the way the movie portrays residents of South Carolina, specifically Gatlin. Having grown in S.C. I can honestly say these were some of the worst portrayals of Southern accents I've ever experienced. If it were only the accents that would be easy enough to handle, but the movie went out of its way to show residents of the small S.C. town as not only accepting of book banning but actively embracing it.<br /><br />The chemistry between the two leads as tragically fated soul-mates was solid enough. Emmy Rossum brought real panache to her role as a villainess. The film was partially successful in trying to impart enough back-story so the audience can keep up without losing them in all of the exposition. The result was a film that felt less like the first installment of a series than an incomplete story that left the audience with too many unanswered questions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best  you can get coins and buy character without paying real money best game in the world I recommend this game to everybody and every age
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  Although it contains violence and graphic descriptions of slavery, it also celebrates human connections.  I had difficulty putting it down once I started reading.
B004ISVH7U|5.0|Fantastic look at a legendary duo, really is one for the personal collection. If you know a fan then i highly recommend you get your hands on a copy
B003YNFYCO|2.0|Yes, a great collection of songs but not great versions.  Just plain vanilla, no heart, versions.  Good price though and a pretty comprehensive disc.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love to look for objects and solved puzzles pipe and pictures are every interesting<br /><br />This is my favorite and fun game
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game makes you think about what the words are. You really have to look close at the pictures to get it
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is Avery beautiful and brilliant book about making good art.<br /><br />You can read it simply as a fantasy too.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this as we have always had an appreciation of British period pieces but this one was very well done indeed. Lots of lovely dresses, lots of cads, knaves, and babes.  What's not to like.  Think people that have a little bit of background on British history of the period would get even more out of it but not at all necessary.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I found Feast for Crows so boring that I barely finished it.  Most of the great characters are not featured.  Instead, a lot of the plot deals with Cersei who I find annoying (seriously, just bump her off already! : )).<br /><br />Dance with Dragons hits the ground running and each chapter has been exciting.  I'm glad I stuck with it, because this book has rekindled my interest in the series.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Was told by my guy that I had to read it and was so glad he recommended it. Flying through book two. Definitely recommended for those who love well written fantasy novels. All thumbs and big toes up! :)
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Some of finest actors of our time combine for a symphony of an emotional ride...absolutely flawless and like a beautiful score the memory will stay with you
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|What a GREAT CD!! Producer Rick Ruben has inspired Ozzy, Toni and Geezer to create a MASTERPIECE in my opinion. Ozzy said that this was going to be the most important album (CD) of his career and I think this CD lives up to that statement (aside from Diary of a Madman). One thing that I noticed is that some of the songs sound like they were written to be sung by Dio or in the style that Dio would have sung them. It's a GREAT CD, buy it, if your a Ozzy or Sabbath fan you wont be disappointed.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A good, entertaining story. It's not the best Gaiman, but it still is a beautifully written fairy tale that will provide a couple hour  of entertainment!
0770435726|5.0|Good mystery and great descriptions of European cities.  Smartly and well written...a page turner.  Enjoyable summer read.  Actually anytime, winter, summer or fall.
0385523394|5.0|I binge-watched the Netflix series and had to have more. A friend told me about the book and I couldn't put it down. Although very different from the series, the book is a story well told. It was fresh and honest. The characters weren't as well developed as the series, but the author spent a lot of time on \\"daily life\\". Interesting!
B008469DGY|3.0|I wish this game were really golf,  but all you are doing is getting points for driving accuracy.  Hopefully this will be expanded in future revisions.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|Every tune on the album was the kind of music that I want to hear. However I prefer music with no lyrics at all.
B00640UICA|4.0|A free game from Amazon which is fairly simple to play but has progressively more difficult levels. The cute little creatures have one of more hands, and frowns turn to smiles when you link the hands. Game over when there are no free hands. I like the non-violent aspect of it. Not as challenging as Mah Jong  however.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|pretty good.  not great.  graphics are good. smooth graphics.  good game play.  slow ros level up.  they want you to buy tokens.  so..... no great
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very entertaining and effortless reading very interesting setting makes me want t o watch t he movie again and again
B005IY3CMQ|5.0|Es un gran trabajo de remezcla del &aacute;lbum original The King Of Limbs, es para o&iacute;rlo con el volumen al 100.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Love this show. It is super fun! It's great to be able to watch all of the episodes at once.
B005WGIJNC|5.0|It took some time and work to assemble but my son loved the toys and plays with them regularly.  He is a fan.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|A different take on the life and motivations of Jesus but in the end really just  opininon<br />Arthur tries hard to be objective, but his  disallusionment with christianity comes through
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so addicting...and since they're always adding seasonal rooms, there's always a room to play! Caller's voices kinda get annoying. But,  it doesn't take long to get hooked :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It was easy to install and operates effortlessly. The fact that it is portable means I can take it anywhere and plug it in and go. The only problem was setting chromecast for all my gmail accounts. This wasn't explained and it took me awhile to figure out I had to go to the Chrome store for each account and add the Chromecast Extension for each user.<br /><br />Now my big question is where is the Coupon for my 3-months free Netflix. It didn't come with the device and I can't find any way to get the coupon. Google states that you need to get the coupon from the retailer you purchased the device from. That's you AMAZON.<br /><br />Now where is my coupon.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So far the walking dead has left me wanting more. Great to watch a zombie show with some character.  I don't know if the thrill is the zombies or survival. I guess both.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works for everything I needed it for...couldn't ask for anything more in a calculator. I have it on my dash board
B008602KQI|5.0|This was a good movie with pretty decent acting and story line. I have not read the book yet but I have been told that the book is much better.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Over all its a fun game .....would like it better if we could get more gold coins without waiting for scratch offs and leveling up...can't afford to throw money away on a game.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Thank goodness for Kindle, because I can catch up on all 4 previous seasons. WOW!!! Violent, but written and acted masterfully.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|gave it 4 stars...because it was too addictive for me, did not want to put it down....also couldn't get anyone to help on road blocks
B002H3T3TM|2.0|Buble is undeniably an incredible singer on recordings and live.  But, as for this video, I will concur with the many reviews that all the interviews interspersed ruins the video.  He's also not shy about cursing.  He got so bad, I just turned if off, and wouldn't show it to the family.  The video should be rated for this.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I don't know why more Americans don't support this artist.  Brings back memories of the 60's and 70's.  Sex, drugs, rock & roll.....
B001W6RRFM|4.0|The author is clearly intelligent on the topic of the English language. His snarky and clever delivery made a normally boring topic somewhat interesting and even quite humorous.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|I am NOT a fan of cage fighting, can't stomach it, but the well acted multi-layed story ,makes for a moving emotional entertainment experience.
B004JZBGWI|2.0|There's another free and much better/easier Notes app available online, who in their right mind would waste their time on this one?
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I love this book because of the funny things you put in here it is soooo funny.  Love this book
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|some parts are too 'perfect' but such a good looking cast and the witty reparte is fun to watch. i looked forward to the twists and turns all the time!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I Was Really surprised that this book would be so interesting and I will most likely read it over again. So descriptive and imaginative worth buying. I LOVED IT!!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|The price and quality were a perfect match for me.  While I would have preferred to be able to stand my 80-200 or 24-70 on it's end and not on it's side, both fit nicely on their sides.  The padding is decent enough for the price and being able to adjust the size of the storage areas with the velcro tabs is a big help.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Having been raised with a fundamentalist's view of Jesus, I've wondered since I was a child why people relate to the Bible. I certainly never did, but I did relate to this book. The big take-aways: Jesus was a Zionist and the New Testaments view of what constitutes Christianity are not the words of Jesus but the words of Paul, a man who never even met Jesus. Finally, the New Testament makes sense to me. Pick up Elaine Pagels \\"Revelations\\" to complete the concept.<br />I've seen many many negative reviews of this book to the effect that since the author is Muslim, he's biased and is not qualified to write about or has an agenda against Jesus. Does this mean that a christian author would be unbiased? I don't think so. I'd also like to add that so many negative reviews by \\"Christians\\" make this book appear even more appealing. Keep it up.
B000002H2H|5.0|I loved this cd since metallica first came out. I received the cd that I ordered and it played like brand new
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />\\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" is an entertaining update of the classic fairy tale in which a Medieval lad by the name of Jack (Nicholas Hoult) acquires a handful of magic beans that sprout into massive stalks, leading him to a race of giants that live in the clouds.<br /><br />Directed by Bryan Singer, the movie boasts a likable cast (Eleanor Tomlinson, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, Ian McShane), spectacular production design and special effects, and an action-packed screenplay that doesn't forget to take time out for a little humor and romance along the way.<br /><br />You won't remember a thing about it five minutes after it's over, but it should keep you entertained for the duration.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|It was an emotional movie.  Sometimes a storm re-enactment can be so unrealistic looking...this one was great- very realistic.  Great ending.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Wonderful use of the Homes stories but brought up to date by this great series and wonderful stars. Loved Season 2 as well
B00DPKQ60A|3.0|The vocals are 5 star of course but i think a few more big Mariah Carey type ballads would have made me this cd a 5. The four songs i like the most are The Way, Baby I, Tattoo song, and the duet ballad is the best ones! I ended up buying this full cd today after listening to it a couple more times but still think most of the songs could have been better. I can see it grows on you after a few more spins.
B000W1YYEK|4.0|Simply stated - a classic Canadian rock album! As with so many Rush songs/albums - not stellar vocals - but more than made up for with incredible lyrics, drumming, guitar/music arrangements.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Loved this book, bummed that I have to wait until January to start part two.  But, then, January is a dark, cold month in the Midwest, so at least I'll have something to look forward to.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Just incredible.... everything has been said.<br />Gripping, crazy, real-life insanity.<br />We are truely the product of our decision making.<br />The hype is deserved.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband, a real country music lover, but I find I enjoy it as much as he does. Both the vocals by Vince Gill and the steel guitar playing of Paul Franklin are lovely! My husband especially loves 'old time country', and this CD is an update on so many of the old classics. A must have for real country music lovers.
B00B9366VO|5.0|If you like watching musicians interact and you want to taste a bit of history, this is a must see. Bought the soundtrack right after watching the movie and will watch the movie again.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Love. Love. Love.  This show is the bomb. The story of Marilyn is very well told. The cast is beyond great. I cannot  wait to finish season 1 and start season 2. Love Kathryn McPhee. She makes the whole show. My new addiction.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Better than any calculator I have used (with the possible exception noted below) since the hand-held of many years ago that saved each entry so that you could go back to any of them, make change(s) and thereby affect the result, like a spreadsheet that could only be looked at, not saved. This one shows only the very last calculation entered and its result, which would be helpful if you wanted to do it over, but so long as Moffsoft FreeCalc on the old XP is still around, it is probably a more useful near miss, because you can save or print the entire string of calculations and keystroke them into a real spreadsheet if need be.
B00ECU2SGS|1.0|How did this movie ever get so many good reviews. It was horrible! It seemed to start out semi-interesting, but then fell flat. So boring I actually fell asleep halfway through it. It has star power but that's about it. What a disappointment!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|My whole family is enjoying creating their favorite Ironman suit and playing this game.  It is easy enough to navigate that my 5 yr old can play easily.
1451695187|5.0|If we could all believe like this what a wonderful world it would be. It is a choice. For me a happy one.
1442352604|5.0|I received this audio book today.Excellent condition,very well packed,and rapid turn around with ordering from Amazon.com.It is in perfect condition,and Philippa Gregory is a master at weaving these historical novels.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|A real treasure trove of great songs from the 60s. Many of the songs are seldom played even on Golden Oldie stations but that doesn't mean that they're not worth listening to.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Love it. Especially Track 16. Oh yeah. ..and six 6, 14...shoot the whole thing's been on repeat in my car since I got it..
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Very good movie, full cast of players. It's a must have. If you miss this don't wait any longer.  I hear part 2 is even better.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I may have a quirky sense of humour, but from the moment the opening to the closing of this brilliantly cast and superbly written comedy, I was laughing and having a great time. It ought to be in the collection of everyone who enjoys a terrific laugh.
B009CGGHL4|4.0|It opens too slow so I took off a star.  Then it gets much better, at the end I like the movie.
B00005RHGL|5.0|A friend recommended that we watch this movie and she was absolutely correct.  It's fantastic.  I read some reviews first that weren't too complimentary but I've learned that I'm not necessarily looking for the same things in a movie that a critic's looking for.<br /><br />The plot and the cast were excellent, especially Kurt Russell & Val Kilmer.  Killmer was especially good as Doc Holliday.  We've already watched this movie twice & I suspect we'll be watching it many more times.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old who is crazy about airplanes loves it. With a little practice he has learned to do most of the activities by himself. The only thing he hasn't been able to do so far is the maze but I'm hopeful he'll understand that soon. In the number/letter matching game where you have to drop the passengers at the correct gate, I do wish they would say out loud what the number or letter is so he would learn to identify them but he has no problem matching the shapes.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was Amazing!! Words can not describe how good this book was!! I would for sure recommended this book
B0000640VO|5.0|If you're ever in need of a movie to life the spirits, this is the one. Though it starts out a bit tragically, it ends on a beautiful note of love and happiness.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|good interesting and free!!! the only problem  is you need to purchase crystals in order to get past certain  stages
B000ID37RM|5.0|Even if you are not a fan of old school b&w, you will still love this classic film.  This is a Top 50 on anyones list.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Finally this small unit has completed it's job.  It is great when a sharp knife is needed in an emergency.  I have used this product a long,long time ago, and this unit almost matches the previous sharpner.  My only complaint is that this sharpner is not made in the USA like the previous sharpner.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I don't know where all the negativity is coming from, unless it's just because Cruise is in it. The movie was entertaining, visually beautiful, and tugged at the heart strings a bit. Overall, what more could you ask for? If you're too brainy to enjoy this film, then you ought to be brainy enough to know you should be looking elsewhere to entertain yourself.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It's an okay book, but not particularly special in the way that the first Hunger Games book was.<br />It wraps up the story and characters, but, well...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love the app. Very realistic. Best game I've played in awhile. I recommend this to any one who likes horses.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|this isa maervelous series.  now I have the full set.  I cant wait for season four.  one of the best on TV
0525953728|3.0|This book is ok and a quick read.  It gives a little background on Navy Seals and some of the rigors of their selection processes.  The story about killing Osama Bin-Laden was a very small part of the book.  I would suggest you go to the 60 Minutes promo for the book as it tells all in a few minutes.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Just as fantastic as they were when I saw them 10 years before AND 10 years before that.  The concert was fantastic and the recording was as great.
B009KUWWW0|5.0|love it could not put it down hope there will be more can't wait  hope Ken right a sequel to this one.<br />read Pillars of earth first
B004J713JW|5.0|My mother is a big Billy Joel fan (I am as well,) and this made a perfect Mother's Day gift.  She really loved it.
B0025KVLS8|1.0|Shame on me for ignoring the 19 (1) comments and being swayed by the 259 (5) comments.  I am totally nonplussed how 259 reviewers could give this product a 5 rating.  Please consider another source if you expect to listed to the nostalgic Beatles songs listed in the Amazon product description.  This is not a true audio CD or at least it does not perform like one.  Grassroots Books should have included appropriate caveats regarding this type CD media.  Other than that I agree with most of the negative reviews already posted for Grassroots CDs.
B0042QNP2S|5.0|My son fell I love with this back-loader, best one of his five other garbage trucks which included a front and a side-loader.  Also the biggest, this truck is made with sturdy plastic and durable moving parts.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The last scene after all the credits was so funny! I loved it! Best Super Hero movie I've seen! So love Ironman!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Puts a great edge on steak knives quicker and easier than anything I've  ever used.Be careful when you check the edge!
B004XWLIJS|5.0|Unpredictable ending...which is what i really like in a movie. Jason Statham is wonderful as always even though his role in this movie has a bit of a twist.
B00821OX98|5.0|Has all the hallmarks of a compelling story with a riveting plot, suspense, deep characters and makes you rethink what 'reality' really is as it pertains to the future course for humanity.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great writing, acting and story lines. The ensemble is one of the most talented groups of people on TV. Their relationships and inter-play are dramatic, intense and usually have enough humor to keep things from being melodramatic.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This product is great for download any video from youtube, at any quality (as long the video allow). Great for keep your favorites videos in your smart device.
B006Y9DY8Q|5.0|I accidentally dropped RedLine into my garbage disposal, I was very upset, then I realized that this is a digital copy and I was able to piece the packets back to together to form the movie again. Another victory for digital content.
B000BB96LW|5.0|It was AWSOME (: got it on time & there was nothing wrong with it except the fact that it wasnt new but otherwise it was a great buy!
B0036S4B6M|2.0|The first fifty pages were pretty interesting and after that the book got more and MORE ... AND ... MORE ...... DULL.  I, like many others, made the mistake of watching the series first (which I absolutely loved).  I couldn't wait to read the \\"unedited\\" version of the crazy cast of characters that the show is teeming with ... that was a huge disappointment ... very little of what is in the show can be found in this book.  What I expected to be a thoughtful, funny, and inspiring memoir turned out to be vapid, shallow, and horribly redundant.  I would like to give it one star, but one star is like leaving a penny at a restaurant, the absolute awfulness of it should be shouting from each page.  I did say that there were some decent pages in the beginning ...<br /><br />I will amend my above statement, I am glad that I watched the show first.  Had I read the book first, the show would have never made it across my tv.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|what i like most about this movie is the play on perception.  the  whole movie is about this one guy and how he looks at the world.  but this knockout model of an Angel falls into his life and gives him another way to look at things.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|The cast was fabulous (Leonardo did not disappoint) in this remake. Set details were amazing. The movie had an incredible soundtrack!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a very different puzzle that kept my attention.  I liked that it was different from the norm. The only fault is that there are only ten levels.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am going to re-watch it again!  Love the characters, love the way its written but wow what a season!  Cannot wait until the next one starts!
B00CZAYL76|5.0|They rock out just as hard ad the others. I love the live version best. If I I had to do it I all over again I would pay for next day shipping.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I down loaded this thinking that it had some helpful hints on the levels.... Well, YouTube has the same information that this one has and I can get to it faster.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|What a fabulous film, nothing like I thought it would be.  Great story, great characters and wonderful special effects.  The extras on the Making Of PI are definably worth a view.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|Fav movie. I love it so much ! Just got done watching it actually. It's pretty trippy but I love the Beatles and so it great
B0073V7YTY|4.0|Neat App. Do not know how accurate it is. Just wanted to see what noise levels are for my ATV.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Can't put down forever on it...downside is waiting on energy! Some of the pics are incredibly hard to find and it gets tedious!
1595141715|3.0|These are the last words from a suicide victim.  I found it sad, discouraging, and depressing.  If I had realized I was reading a book written for Young Adults, I would not have bought it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It left you hanging but, a real good book. Excited about the next one! Please post the date of the next Crossfire Book.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|The writing and acting is very high quality. Battlestar Galactica is the best television series I've seen and I am a huge fan of Star Trek Next Generation.
B000641Z90|4.0|Long long time ago, I watched him perfect drum play on DVD at CES Vegas.<br />This time I find that DVD.<br />Very happy.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|Soooooo many songs that are new to me.  Love listening to these.  Great buy and would recommend them. This is a complete set of their songs through the years.
0399243860|5.0|I came across this book at our local bookstore and fell in love with it. I started using it in my preschool class, and now it's the kids' most favorite book! We start with a color on the top and then go through the pictures down below to find the one that matches asking the same question for each picture, \\"Is the lemon red? Noooooooo!\\" We do this until we match the right picture with the right color, and the kids ages 18 months to 3 years eat it right up. They love it!! I was surprised by some of the not-so-favorable reviews of this book...it's a HUGE favorite around my house and in my class!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the writer's style by alternating the chapters with the main characters. The first 2/3 of the book was a real page-turner for me.  To say anymore would require a serious spoiler alert.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This book is crazy ridiculous. The end of it is dumb. Don't even try to read the third one. It's not even hot, it's boring and less believable than any J.Lo movie I've ever seen.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|Best of the 3 seasons!  Many of the best episodes were incorporated herein.  Everyone should view it.  Enjoy and think.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Like seriously. Why did you write this one EL James. So boring. So stupid. None of it makes sense. I don't get it.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Somewhat hard to watch especially since I had a relative caught in the Tsunami but it seemed very real.  Actors did an excellent job!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I luv my little pony I watched every single ep i like apple jack and i like there new moive
B002B3D2TU|5.0|Helps me think while studying. My wife plays it for her students. She says that it helps with their creativity.
140006922X|5.0|I loved the book, Reza Aslan did research which gave a more thorough look into the life of Jesus and a greater understanding of who he was.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I just love when a book is so exciting you can't wait to sit down and read more.  Gillian Flynn writes magnificently.  Her descriptions are so vivid and believable, the story seems so real.  And when, half-way through the book, the big surprise occurs, it is totally unexpected.  I was so amazed by the incredible writing in this book, that I immediately downloaded two of her others.  And, so far, I have not been disappointed.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This alarm clock is really useful it is totally worth getting it it has good tunes and always wakes you up on time this is a great app!!
B002S8AGZG|5.0|This movie is a must have for anybody. It's adorable and full of cute comedy. I absolutely love Heath Ledger and this is a great movie with him in it :) Win win.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My daughter loves the Austin & Ally show so I bought her this CD. She loves listening to it and dancing around her room.
B003Y5H57E|4.0|I have been looking for movies to add to my chick flick collection and this one was a perfect addition!
0743581490|4.0|Good plot, good acting.  Will watch this movie again.  Love the narrative in the background of the main character.  It gives you a first hand view into his life.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and all its wonder! It is a must read for all ages. Do yourself a favor... your welcome:)
B00932A4XE|5.0|Brought back memories, very funny movie.  It was very true to life will watch this movie again.  My husband enjoyed it too.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this bingo game..it's lots of fun, free and it is one of the few that lets you convert tickets to coins so you can stay in the game ,stocked with power ups and keys. It also has free daily tournament which I never miss...
B005C8ENI0|5.0|It left you guessing, the acting was good and the plot was really good.  I would watch this movie again
0446310786|5.0|Once you read through the first few pages of exposition, buckle your belt.<br /><br />I had read this book in high school and remember enjoying it very much. I bought it for my 16 year old cousin to read and so I decided to buy a copy for myself to see what I had gotten her into. (Maybe it wasn't as good as I remembered?)<br /><br />I was wrong. This book is as great as I remembered. No, it was BETTER than I remembered. As an adult you have a whole new perspective and it  makes the book that much better. The lessons it teaches are still relevant today and the characters you meet feel like real people.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this book... Just buy it.. Read it... Share it... It's an amazing piece of literature.
B004XUMMFE|3.0|Star Trek was once described by Gene Roddenberry as &#34;wagon trains in outer space.&#34; Joss Whedon, creator of Firefly must have liked that comment and decided to make it more of the focus of his show, a space-horse opera, if you will. The idea is outrageous enough to work on its own merits, but the execution is another matter. While the acting is excellent, the plots are too heavy handed and simplistic. If they'd aimed for slightly more complex story lines and dialogue, this show might still be running, today instead of being cancelled before the first season ended.
B0000025ZF|5.0|I am so glad i found amazon.com. I looked for over 20 years for this cd. I had it once before and now thanks to you I got it back. Thank you so much. Wade
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Quite a lot of laugh out loud moments in this book. It's the story of a socially awkward high functioning 'aspie' coming out on top against the odds.<br /><br />I always enjoy talking to people with Asperger's syndrome for their unique take on the world. It's part of my work as a psych nurse. While I acknowledge that the main character, Don, is a bit of a sterotypical autistic savant, the author seems to have taken pains to show him as a good guy. Simson acknowledges some of the loneliness and isolation the protagonist deals with as part of his very peculiar parameters for existing. But he demonstrates just how much thought our hero puts into his social relationships.<br /><br />Great read. One sitting, about 4 hours in all.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|As a long term fan of Jack Reacher, I was looking forward to the first film of the series. Tom Cruise was not even in the first 50 actors I would have chosen in the title role. After seeing the film, I have no reason to change my opinion. Technically, the film was very well done; the action was suitably drenched in testosterone and the plot line was reasonably  developed. However, I could not get beyond the miscasting. I certainly hope this error will be rectified in future film treatments.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Awesome story, keeps the reader wanting more. Can't wait to read the rest. Best value I have ever come across.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|This is one of the finest movies made.  Both a biting insightful satire, and a warning of how things can seem sensible each step of the way and result in madness.<br /><br />It is filled with great actors who are masterfully directed by Stanly Kubrick.<br /><br />For modern audiences the special effects are cheesy.  Sometimes the acting is too, but that is done with a purpose.<br /><br />It won't have the relevancy for those who didn't live in those days just after the Cuban missile crisis or the days of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD, never has something been so appropriately named by its initials).  Still all the other aspects of modern strife will ring true for modern audiences.  So this movie from a half century ago ages very well indeed.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, watch it. You won't regret it.<br /><br />For another view of those times The Bedford Incident from 1965 with Sidney Portier and Richard Widmark is also worth viewing.  It isn't nearly as entertaining as this satirical Dr. Strangelove however.
0517053616|5.0|I love leather bound books, especially when i can get them for a great price like this. I honestly have not read this yet, but it looks great out on the shelf.
B000004286|5.0|When I have a busy and stressful day looming ahead of me, I play this soundtrack while I am getting ready to face the day.  By the time I am ready.......I am NOW ready to conquer the day!  Powerful!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|My kids love this game.  Even the 5 year old is better at it than I am, and I'm a video freak!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This product was a steal at the sale price, it is very lightweight and provides protection for your screen as well as a stand for your reader
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! The ONLY bad thing about it is that it is NOT AVAILABLE on my windows 8 phone! The apps available for it are not even close to being able to do the things this app can.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|The best singing group of all time...love their music...never tire listening to them....love love love love love them...next to Elvis!
B004XANKVO|5.0|This backpack has made my life much easier with respect to the size and portability that it offers. The space is incredible and the compartments are ideal for whenever you need to carry a large load and trust me, as a college student carrying 300+ page books to school and your classrooms are located on a hill, this bag does its job!
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|The movie is good on my computer but I thought I would be able to transfer it to my galaxy tablet.so I could watch it on the go. I could not .
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Once I start playing this game, I can't stop for hours. It's completely addicting! It's definitely a new spin on a classic.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is a refreshing program for American TV. The writing is truly genius. I enjoy the mix of drama with humor, as well as the historical aspect. When I watch I feel like I'm back in that time period. The acting is top notch! I'm bummed the hiatus is so long - waiting for another season is painful!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I would say that 'Battery HD' is a very good app I love how you can choose the Colorado that you want your battery to be and I like how it tells you what percent it is at and I just really like this app so anyone who reads this should definitely buy this app and its also ... FREE !! everybody loves free right lol but yep.
B005QBBCMI|4.0|A great look into the soul of addiction and desperation.  Seen it several times now.  Cage and Shue are great in this flick.  Highly recommended.
630542845X|5.0|Great movie.  I seem to repurchase every few years... and here we are again.  Put it in, relax, kick back, enjoy.
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|For awhile now I had heard friends talking about Downton Abbey.  Finally this summer, while back in the US from overseas, I was able to watch all three seasons.  I absolutely LOVE this show!!!  Needless to say, I own all 3 seasons and can't wait for Season Four!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|There was a time when I couldn't a YouTube video of hot girls washing cars from my bedroom to the tv in the living room to interrupt my gay male roommate and his boyfriend's movie night woot warning.  But now I can.  Thanks, Chromecast!<br /><br />(There are a lot of glitches with this, you can send video except through YouTube.<br /> Netflix doesn't yet work. You can send up a tab in Google Chrome too. Once the software is out of Beta, is gonna be slick.)<br /><br />Worth the low price tag.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have read all of Grisham's work and this book did not let me down. Will continue to read John Grisham.
098357670X|5.0|Love it!  My very first caricature job was with Mr. Richmond back in 1993.  All the basics that he trained us in at the amusement park are in this book plus more.  Truly one of the best tutorials when it comes to caricaturing that I have come across!  Definitely a need for anyone who wishes to draw caricatures!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Without spoiling the ending, which I didn't like, I thought this was one of the best episodes of this season.  Will really miss Matthew, wish they didn't kill him off.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a very refreshing take on the sci-fi survivalist tale.  Well written with engrossing characters, and a real page turner. You won't find better value for your money than this book. I can't wait to read more of Mr. Howey's work!
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|Not a huge step up from the first. Better concept, bad execution. Not enough Storm Shadow and Snake-eyes. Bruce needs to go.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|The Tudors is a fun 'frolic' of a show. Twists/turns all following mostly historically recorded events.... Mostly. They do take some creative license
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Picked this up on the suggestion of the Sword & Laser podcast and was not disappointed. I read it over a week of travel and really enjoyed it.
B000JCSPG0|4.0|It's okay, but it's the Stargate series that was really a great show.  This just sets the stage for something far better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really good fun, played with my son who really liked it. The puzzles are not too hard but we need more levels!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book - oh man this book!  So touching.  I laughed and cried.  I love books that can do that - mix up my very emotion.  I'd definitely recommend this book.  I liked the relationship between Hazel and Gus and I hope their infinities meet again (I know it's fictional but I can still hope).  The compassion and care from parents, the truth surrounding death and how everyone comes to wish you well at first diagnosis and then nothing else until after death.  How those who truly care suffer in the process of watching the dying.  And as morbid as it sounds its not such a depressing book.  And I hope we can all leave a scar.  I found so many quotes in this book that touched me deeply.  Bravo Mr Green, bravo.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was so good! I read a lot and so many books end predictably. This is the first time, since reading My Sister's Keeper (Jodi Picoult), that I just didn't see it coming. There were no lulls in the story, and although I wasn't always sure I wanted to root for the kid, it was an amazingly enjoyable read. At points I wished the narration switched to the mother's point of view - but mostly just out of curiosity. I think I have found my next favorite author.
B001EBWING|5.0|Even despite the subtle racism (expected for the times) I love this movie....complex, beautifully filmed. And the story line is phenomenal. Of all of the movies I have seen this is still in my top five of all time.
B0052REQLK|5.0|Certainly a new perspective, and brought up points I never thought about.  It was also really nice to reaffirm some of my own self revelations.<br /><br />I think it was a great read and every twenty something year old should read it, too.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very interesting game. Keeps your interest and time flys.<br />Has given me no problems and is FREE what more could one ask for?
B0070UFMOW|5.0|First you need to decide if you have a use for this. I do. I mix music on my PC and switch back and forth between headphones and 5.1 surround speakers while doing so. Unfortunately, in this day and age of high powered gaming rigs, PC makers have gone cheap in the headphone output department by using weak amps and terrible DACs. So for me, being able to crank up the volume and get clean, virtually uncolored DAC output to my headphones is important.<br /><br />This works great with any PC or laptop and the better quality of your headphones the better it works.<br /><br />It will work to amplify output from phones and tablets but it will NOT do any DAC functions when connected via 3.5mm stereo jack. For the DAC to work it must be connected via USB or SP/DIF.<br /><br />If any of my review makes no sense to you then you probably don't need this. For those who grok what a DAC/amp is for this is a sweet little unit for the price. The only one I've ever heard personally that sounded better was a Schiitz vacuum tube amp paired with a Schiitz DAC. Combined they were 10 times the price of the FIIO. They were not 10 times better to my ears. Your mileage may vary.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Place shapes us. It defines our boundaries and sometimes forces us to push beyond them. Hosseini recreates the places that shape and define in rich, vivid detail. He lovingly shares the legends that transform his characters into timeless figures in ageless struggles to belong, know, and love. The Kite Runner was a beautiful book about fathers and sons, sin and redemption, and war-torn regions. A Thousand Splendid Suns was an equally beautiful tale about mothers and daughters, identity and liberty in war-torn regions. And the Mountains Echoed is all that the first two novels explored in prose that has become richer and more felicitous. Read all of Hosseini's books; you will enjoy each one, and the third will transport you to other places, universal and poignant.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Fits my wife's Nexus 10 tablet perfectly and seems to charge somewhat faster than the Mini-USB port. She has a habit of setting the tablet down at awkward angles or nodding off holding it which is what prompted me to buy the POGO cable in the first place. I've seen the tablet lying at weird angles causing undue strain and stress when plugged in the normal way. With this cable, if she gets things sideways without realizing it the POGO just pops off. No harm done. No damage to cable or port. Cable arrived very quickly.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Wow, what a great, refreshing and new NIN experience. All the tracks are awesome sounding (aside from Everything, I haven't warmed up to that one yet).<br /><br />Highly recommend giving it a go. If you're a hardcore old style NIN fan, be sure to listen to it with an open mind and realize that Trent Reznor is in a much happier, brighter stage of his life and he writes and produces what he is feeling at the time. It's beautiful for that aspect alone!<br /><br />Favorite song... definitely Various Methods of Escape. Wow, such emotion in that particular song especially. I'm blown away and hope that this song is performed in the upcoming tour lineup. &#60;3
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I was upset that after having it for a few days it would not open but I was able to fix this problem and now I use it to take notes on everything. It made shopping with my kindle easier.
B005KXU83G|5.0|The perfect live album very good song selection and just a great feel through out the entire album! You cant go wrong with nine Tonight!
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I'd give it 100 stars if I could.  They don't make them like this anymore.  Goonies never say die!  Boom!
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|It looked computerized.<br />Nick and Daisy were not portrayed convincingly. It was as if they were reading their lines.<br />Leo did a nice job.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a Fun game that makes u think and time flies while you are playing. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained.
B003Y5USF0|4.0|It's an enjoyable film for some light entertainment....not too thoughtprovoking, but certainly not drivel. Don't know why more words should BE REQUIRED than a person has to say for a review.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I have loved using this on my Kindle Fire and would recommend this app to anyone that is looking for a basic calculator.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great book, I've read all the books in a week! A must read for everyone...trust me you will enjoy them!
B006LSZECO|4.0|85% of this book was a page turner. The end was sub-par. Felt like the writer tried to quickly wrap up the story.
B00CWVGNS8|4.0|Yes, I liked the movie a lot. It was inspiring and made me feel good about the world around me.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smart, witty...love how the characters play off each other.  Definately is worth a weekend marathon.  I immediately started season two!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I'm a casual but long-time gamer.  Jetpack is, in my humble opinion, one of the best games ever made: clever, amusing, addictive, challenging but not too, fun, well thought out, well done, flawless play.  I'd be interested to see what else you can do Halfbrick.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|What can I say.  It's a lot of fun trying to beat your last score.  I now have over 518,000.  Hope to improve on it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Lots of fun and fun and fun and Jennifer Lawrence is sexy. I love her. Definitely. Oh yeah
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great series..once you start you wont want to put it down!!! I bought the first and then continued to the next ones. Great reading!
B00E978FGQ|4.0|Now You See Me is a entertaining movie and you really wont see the plot twist coming at the end. I enjoy it when I can rent a movie not expecting much from it and end up pleasantly surprised. My only issue with the movie, and one that didn't really detract from my fun in watching it, is that the magic tricks became so detailed that this movie started to enter the land of science fiction. I don't care how good a magician is there was no way some of the things in the movie would ever happen, and I was almost expecting to see a time traveler from the future responsible for giving them the ability to do some of the fantastical things that I saw. This was just a fun, if sometimes unbelievable, movie to watch with a good cast, and I definitely recommend it to those looking for something fun to rent on Amazon.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was so great! Loved the characters! I read this one in less than a week!! I didn't want it to end!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|The graphics are great, controls are fun and my 3 year old loves it.  I'm sure much older kids or adults would enjoy it as well.  Simple, no rules and a great just for fun game.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|I bought this for our grandchildren to watch when they come over to our house; they really enjoyed it, and so did I. I found it very creative and fun. It may be just a little scary for very young kids.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I didn't think it could get any better, but it was and I keep getting pushed closer to the edge of my seat.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I have read all of the Jo Nesbo books that have been available in this series.  This was the most recent one that I have read, and apparently was the first Harry Hole book.  The writing has evolved and improved over the course of the books, but does anything really good ever last for poor Harry???????
B007IQX9ZW|4.0|It will make you uncomfortable until the very end, but in a way that reminds you that we are all human. We all struggle and stumble. It just takes some of us a little longer to pick ourselves up at times.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|A fairly fun older kids flic, but a wee bit tedious on the over emphasis of crappy dad, dejected lad thing.  I didn't like him fighting that bull at the beginning, and yes, I know it's a movie.  I'd give it a 3.5, but rounded up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the minions have very small brains but have enough intelligence as to when they must fear and run for their lives and when to run for a simple chase.
B008469DGY|1.0|Superb graphics. Simply beautiful. But I don't like all the ads that are clustered around the greens. The ads ruin the whole experience.<br /><br />It's almost like putting billboards up in a national park. Yuck.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is so much fun. I never thought it would be so addicting. its so  funny and laugh out loud funny when the bombs explode.
B00C1C123E|2.0|This is the one Jurassic park movie everyone forgets as it was a horrible movie. Once this started I remembered why I did not recall this movie. Horrible acting and awful special effects
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game but I wish they would make Chicago with a person that looks a little like the character on Miami but black
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Had a lot of fun with this game. Good story line. Relaxing game without it feeling like a dumbed down.
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|I loved playing this game on the computer then they had the app available on the Kindle app store it's really smooth on my normal Kindle Fire so I recommended it to people who know about online pool games.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too hard or too easy. Enjoyed playing and look forward to more levels and maybe a seasons issue like 100 floors although this was easier. my only complaint was that it did not save your progress on a floor if you left in the middle.
B004I744AS|5.0|The word dictionary really helps. If they're are words I don't know, I can always count on the free dictionary
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|With the details of the book, I expected a more detailed resolution<br />Still worth reading the trilogy.  Decent story well done
B008JF8O9M|5.0|It has greatly increased my tablet capabilities.  You will need to purchase the Pro Version which is three (3) less expensive than other competing printing apps!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Starts out a little slow, but once it gets going it's non-stop :) Love the cast!  They have great chemistry.  Can't wait for RED 2!
B005ISQ7JM|2.0|It was a free book and thus I don't want to be too critical, however, I wouldn't recommend reading it either. Better information and content can be found on the web by simply entering HTML into your favorite search engine.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Very quick read. It has been years since I have read a Grisham novel and am reminded of how good he is.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|An adult version of glee but much better!  The music is terrific and we were hooked on the story line.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I don't even need to say anything. Just read it yourself. It's just so.. real in a sense- is an amazing experience.
B005J29HD0|4.0|Really enjoyed the recordings, as they veer from silly, to gorgeous, to wistful, to melancholy. Having said that, the vinyl pressings seem to suffer from a lot of defects. Obviously, this isn't amazons fault, and they took care of the problem, but buyer beware, would be my advice.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is easy to play-----it's BINGO after all. But the addition of winning prizes and different rooms and slots makes it a lot of fun.  You can also chat and trade items to finish rooms which in turn earns more credits.  Just love it.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Give McConaughey some darn awards already.  Fantastic performance! The costar kid was great as well. Definitely watch this with a bit of bourbon in hand.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very credible and inspiring.  The ending is wonderful and prompts one to never doubt the presence of heaven.  Dr. Alexander is a real blessing to all of us.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Really enjoy this version of this game. Loads fast and easy to view with good size and clearly  marked tiles.
B00BB8UJKG|1.0|Last clue for me:  the downstreaming failed with about 15 minutes left in the movie, and I realized that I was grateful!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Tough to watch and doesn't follow the book too closely.  Again, I don't like having to write 20 characters to submit a review.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|It's an interesting and funny tv series and I hope it can produce more seasons. It's like a scientific story happened in old times.
B0084670FU|3.0|Requires attention to follow the plot. Not a film to pass the time. To a certain extent, it helps to describe the mentality in that part of the world.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down once I started reading it! I can't wait to continue the trilogy and watch the movie!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Great acting, directing, moral to the story and ending. It's great to have loved and lost<br />but if it doesn't work out, move on.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|One of my fave albums from the boys. So happy that he music has evolved into something bigger n better. So much maturity in the lyrics whilst remaining true to the backstreet boys!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like to play this game a lot my little brother plays too! and we have fun playing it during cheese time
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I really like this book..it keeps me wanting to read on and on! It's very touching and I just really like it.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|smart, sexy, and back stabbing. story lines are intriguing and they keep you wondering which way it will end. my favorite show.
B00E1LAS42|5.0|Favorite movie of the summer! Amazing cast and performances. As well as sound track. Absolutely great movie and if you haven't seen it youre missing out!
0786891416|5.0|If you love the TV show Castle you will absolutely love this book. Couldnt put it down. Characters are just like they are in the show. Witty, funny, just perfect
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Having to buy toooo many pearls stinks.<br />However, I sit and play for hours.  It's all my daughters fault, she downloaded it 'for me'. JOY!!
B001XULSG6|4.0|Really great story. I thought there was a kind of Prime Directive meets Individualism that played out via Zephram Cochran. Interesting, esp in the shadow of Borg presence.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Great... if you're twelve.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|This was a great movie.  Lots of action. Was surprised I liked it.  Arnold delivers again! A great movie for the whole family.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have a hard time sleeping but this app I got on my kindle fire really works it even has special features for if you use headphones.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Start with season 1; this is excellent programming for the whole family. I can't wait for season 4 to begin next year!
B004U7JYXS|5.0|Great price compared to local retail, quality of resulting pictures suggest it is fresh and has been stored properly.  Used it with a Fujifilm Instax Mini 50S camera, and an Instax mini filmback on my Lomo LCA+ with great results for both. Of course, there is the inherent limitation that the actual images on the prints generated are only 46mm X 62mm in size, but if you are looking at this review, you probably already know that.
B0096HIEE2|2.0|I only bought it because i wanted to see Channing Tatum. Other than that, this movie was horrible. The ending was the worst. It didnt even have an ending. Dont waste your money. Unless you really want to see Channing dance.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A fantasy story that the wife and I just loved.  Seems to have religious overtones, but not a 100% which religion.  Clean exciting and a thought provoking film ...
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The movie seemed a little long, a little slow at times and a little hard to follow at times.  My grandkids of 12 and 11 really liked it but Jack Reacher and other movies with Tom Cruise are much better. It was an okay movie but a little less than what I expected.
B000FC1192|5.0|Discovering Neil Gaiman's books has been good for me. Just the right interlude from reality or maybe into reality that I needed.
B006LSZECO|3.0|weakest ending to any book I have ever read.  The story was good but the ending was beyond anti-climatic and disappointing.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Both entertaining and educational. Film shows how the music business has changed. Fun scenes of Paul McCartney and other greats, too.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Everyone should see this.  Fracking is going on all across the country. It will make you decide not to sit back and be complacent.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|I love Julie Andrews and the whole cast! The music is just wonderful! This is definitely one you will always remember.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Lincoln said military glory is a rainbow in blood and I see his point, yet at some point<br />one must wonder if evil must be confronted even if one is physically and even mentally<br />weaker than the evil.  There is no Starfleet and our wars are petty wars over wealth<br />and the right to take from the weak. Still, one has to wonder what role a life of duty,<br />honor and courage has to offer.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Awesome show, not only entertaining but lots to learn as well. A must watch for anyone with a passion for the law (even if mainly for entertainment)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just loved Season 3 of Downton Abbey.  The end was very sad, so I can't wait to see Season 4.  I love the clothes and the way of life in England way back then.  Thank you for 3 free seasons with my Prime membership.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|Run away now!  Don't download!  This is a waste of your time.  You cannot steam TV live at all.  Very dissapointed in this app.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Excellent read and amazing story, I enjoyed it so much that I'm downloading his other books now.  Can't recommend highly enough.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is an excellent little product for the price.  It does a really good job of playing YouTube videos I've picked from my phone.  It has a little more trouble streaming videos from my laptops chrome browser.  I wasn't able to get a good picture from the ABC website or hulu.com.  The videos weren't synced with the sound and would stop and start a lot.  I've just decided to use it only from the dedicated apps from now on to prevent further frustration on my part.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|I thought the movie had an interesting look and feel to it right from the beginning and it involved me right away. The acting of Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman was absolutely amazing. They both gave powerful performances and looked sincere and genuine at every moment. I think the live singing made the film much better than most musicals and (hopefully) set a new standard.  I loved the quality and naturalness of the sound.<br /><br />I'm generally not a big fan of this sort of epic-level drama, but the actors pulled off the dramatic ending well, and I found it very moving. I think this movie, overall, is precedent setting and an artistic success.
B001AT4Y84|5.0|If you liked the first Terminators,  you will also enjoy this story.  Lots of action and classic Terminator acting.  Fun for myself and my 13 year old son.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Ready to get on with the second book right away.<br />Hope the rest of the series is just as good!
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I loved, loved the pride series. REad them all. I always want more. Wouldn't mind one more book about them
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I recently discovered this show and I love it! I love all the story lines! BBC always has great shows!
B004ADF7RO|5.0|The goodies is a great classic movie that lives on. The characters are memorable and the movie is great for audiences young or old. A feel good adventure movie.
0857208748|5.0|Have enjoyed all of the Mitch Rapp novels written by Vince Flynn...am so sadden by the death of Mr Flynn and will miss the further adventures of his creation of Mitch Rapp, super CIA hero.
1931559317|5.0|Along with my Norton's Star Atlas, the Pocket Sky Atlas never leaves the vicinity of my 'scope unless it's to plop it on my desk and plan out an observing session. Of great value is the spiral binding, allowing easy, non-spine-breaking layout. With white background, it is easily visible under red filter observing lights, big enough to see by most eyes, yet small enough for portability when having to march a distance for telescope set up. In that case, the Norton's stays in the truck. A great companion for any other star atlas of even computer atlas.
1455526959|5.0|I have been a great fan of Harry Bosch in the Michael Connelly novels. Was not disappointed in this latest in the series.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I was never able to see it during broadcast times.  It was great seeing it without commercials and all in one long weekend!!!
B00005N6KG|2.0|The head band snapped the first day I used it. Cheaply made for the high amount I paid. I do not recommend!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever I got it right away for free .<br />I would do anything to get this game up and running if the game shut down.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Four books into this epic I find myself thinking at times why I vested my time and effort.  This series contains so many characters one would need a spreadsheet to keep track of them.  Also, the author spends too much time with providing intricate details of things that bear no great significance to the story.  The reason why I just purchased book five and will most likely purchase every other book thereafter is because of the main group of characters that I have fallen in love with.  Hopefully book five is a better read.
0880796863|5.0|This tarot set is beautiful! The illustrations are perfect, the book however is little hard to read. I love the ancient, earthly feel of these cards even before they are charged and blessed. After charging and blessing however, they are perfectly balanced with an antique, earthly feel. I would definitely order from this seller again, the packaging was perfect and the cards came undamaged.
B005XUC398|3.0|I felt the dialog and acting were great but the story was lacking ...and the ending ..was boring .....like wait did it just end ..is that all ?
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is part of a trilogy and keeps a person on the edge of his seat....intriging. You have to go on to the next chapter...very difficult to stop.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|Stars Dance is her best CD so far... it is upbeat and perfect for working out and/or dancing. Great lyrics, beats, and voice.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Loe it - love it - love it.  Took no more than 5 minutes to get it working.  I am very pleased with it.  Did I say I loved it ?
B001ANSSDC|4.0|USUALLY THE MOVIE ISNT AS GOOD  THIS TIME IT ISMOVIE SHOWED THE ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE COUPLE  LOVED THE DANCING  MUSIC LINGERS IN YOUR HEAD
B003G4W49C|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. Kept my interest, taught or reminded one of good principles to shape your life by, doing your best always and never giving up, keeping your eye on the prize, etc., you get the picture. I plan on reading more of Orson Scott Card's books. Can't wait until my grandsons get a little older, I think they'll like this one.
B0012GMUPO|1.0|Yes this is what happens when Desmond Child is coupled with Alice what we all get is this hair metal 'opus'. Crappy lyrics, songs that have never ending bon jovi-esque choruses ('bed of nails' anyone? yuck) and not too mention the music; all pointless emotionless guitar solos and the synth sounds are some of the worst I've ever heard, has anyone noticed that synthesizers somehow sounded better in the 70's?    Alice seems content to snarl through the whole thing too, not once does he go out of that range gone are the days when he emoted.    Just for context I like everything Alice did up until Dada, this and to a lesser extent hey stoopid are the absolute nadir of Alice's catologue. It's no wonder that none of this s*** crops up in Alice's setlists anymore except poison.    Also please stop saying this is heavy metal, hair metal is some trashy ball-less hybrid at best.    If it's some consolation things get better after trash and stoopid in fact skip these two and go straight to last temptation.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|You need to get more than one, because it becomes such a favorite. Our grandson loves his monkey. Before he could grasp, he could still pull it into him because of the attached toy. We have twin grandchildren, boy and girl. One is not into pacifiers, and her Wabbanub was never a hit, but the other had more trouble calming, and this helped him keep his needed soother in his mouth.
B00003CXCD|4.0|The dvd came fast.  I love the old shows and especially ones with<br />Audrey Hepburn in them....I'm a fan<br />It was in great condition
B0053O89KG|5.0|I have watched all 4 seasons many times on DVD. Have favorites in all of them. This season has the fun, the funny, and the dramatic. Also love the bloopers in the Special Features section!!
0143124544|3.0|This book came in a timely manner but I've just started reading it<br />It was recommended by a friend and took her advice and got it
B003TH2G4Y|5.0|I really enjoy these kinds of movies.  Just the adventure.  Just the fun of it all.  Good vs evil.  The good guys will eventually win.
B00005JKNC|5.0|That is cute & romantic movie with a crazy actor Jim Carrey...!! We like it & it is good condition DVD.. Thank you & have a good day!!
B004V9MU86|5.0|A well written book.  It was clever and easier to read the harsh reality of the Nazi war seen through a young girls eyes.  We could see how hard it was for her and those around her.  Sometimes there were very endearing moments which was a pleasure to read.<br />Even when you have nothing you can still brighten a child's heart.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Although it doesn't have enough of the villains that were in the movie, it is well thought out for an endless-runner type game. ISO-8 could be cheaper, though.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|when you use more than one bingo card it's hard to see and at the end of the bingo it doesn't give you enough time to mark that last number before it ends.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I am listening to this CD at least twice a day...............Guitar heaven. I really enjoy the mixture of styles that is on this CD. I consider<br />&#34;When my train pulls in&#34; as containing some of the greatest guitar riffs ever recorded. I especially love &#34;Please come home&#34; it also contains some awesome guitar work.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|This was a refreshingly different movie than the usual blockbusters that played during the summer. If you like plot twists and turns and a great wtf? at the end this movie has it all.
B005DESVPO|5.0|Awesome stuff....................these guys are very enjoyable to listen to. Hendrix and Taj Mahal rolled into one. I am considering traveling just to see another one of the guitar greats in person.
0321334876|4.0|Very useful book. It has a precise, smart and elegant way to explain concepts.<br />Depending on your knowledge of C++ it may appear confusing sometimes.
B009GFEOY8|1.0|in the old Polaroid camera, thought I was going to impress the kids w/ a find from the closet......don't waste your money
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|When this book started I wasn't sure where it was gong to go.  I've read all of the books in this series and clearly things were coming to a head for Kaleb but I never anticipated how.  This book was the culmination of the world building of the past books and it was excellent.  The writing was stellar.  Ms. Singh crafted her story, wove as a fine tapestry, never giving away too much and always keep her reader engaged.  The story got better with every turn of the page.  It was suspenseful, dramatic, romantic, and dynamic.  By far the best in the series.  This book was more than worth the read, it was worth savoring.<br /><br />Nook Pages: 368
B003R0MEZ4|4.0|I have enjoyed watching this show since its first showing.  If you like FBI profiling then you will like this series.  It is too bad that the first FBI profiling show, The Profiler, was discontinued.  That show was very good also.
0062059963|4.0|For me, The Selection and The Elite are like the trashy tv of books. There's not a whole ton of quality, but you get sucked in and can't look away. You get a sick sense of satisfaction after reading it. You feel a little bit guilty after reading it, but you so enjoy it. I have no qualms about admitting how much I enjoy these books. They're dramatic and frothy and suck away hours of your life before you know it. There is little better than spending the night curled up reading a book like The Elite, in my opinion.<br /><br />The Elite picks up very quickly after the end of The Selection. America is still vacillating between Maxon and Aspen, and for much of the book I was so frustrated with her, because I just KNEW exactly who she should pick. The great thing is, though, there are events in The Elite than make you question your opinion over and over again. One moment I was happy and the next I was angry. I honestly got as confused as American in who to pick.<br /><br />At the same time, there's a raising of the stakes. No spoilers, but America is under pressure to make her decision for more than one reason. The rebels are getting restless, though no one can really tell why. There's still little plot, just the Selection going on with things happening all around. That being said, there's some game-changing events.<br /><br />Without including spoilers, which I know you don't want if you want to read this book, it's hard to review in much detail. But I can say, I enjoyed The Elite quite a bit more than The Selection. There are some great twists and turns and you are kept on the edge of your seat throughout. If taken for the light fare it is, The Elite is great fun to read and if you loved the first book, you'll love The Elite even more!
B0058YPILY|4.0|I have enjoyed watching this show since its first showing.  If you like FBI profiling then you will like this series.  It is too bad that the first FBI profiling show, The Profiler, was discontinued.  That show was very good also.
B00CE0ZY46|5.0|I have a 5 year old boy who is very sensitive to any kind of simulated violence. Even animated violence can be too much for him. Shaun is great because it's done in the wonderful stylings of &#34;Wallace and Grommitt&#34; in the way of the Claymation. It is a very good cartoon for those kids who love humor and excitement without the tense scenes.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD3 AM3+ i use this motherboard with Fx8320 cpu and Cooler Master GeminII M4 these parts work really well
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Very easy to follow - not confusing like some opera's;  My kids 12 & 18yrs old both loved it and watch it over and over.  A beautiful and tragic love story and the music stays in your head.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This book is a wonderful book for young children.  Lots of events happen in the book.  Lots of fun for everyone.
1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson did a fine job writing about Steve Jobs. Such an interesting book! When you begin to read, you won't want to put the book down!
0142501123|5.0|Cute book and lots of fun.  My grandson loves the rhymes and story line.  Will be a cute book to read and take to school for Halloween time.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|While  Kindle for Android was a useful addition to my tab, I could not access my personal documents, those that I had on my Kindle itself, with the app. So I see it as good, and useful, but not as good as it might be. As a student I carry my laptop or tab with me at times when I would not carry my Kindle. As I send my notes to my Kindle as PDFs I find this facility very helpful. Not being able to access this material on the Android app means that i must either carry hard copy notes or bring along the Kindle itself.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I LOVED IT, CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE TO COME OUT I AM HANGING ON THE EDGE AND SO EXCITED
B00CH26TL8|3.0|its too glitchy.  it freezes and shoots randomly, etc etc.  i uninstalled it the same day because i knew i wouldn't want to play again.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Something to do when your bored. Sometimes it can be tricky finding what they want on such a small screen, by you make due. Every time you go back to the same room they move the pieces on you.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|so useful, it keeps all my lists and notes organized on my kindle and i can email them to myself or other people.  only problem is that i can't connect it to my email or google account to sync with my phone.

B00DIMXTBO|5.0|\\"Outin\\" by Brandt Legg is the second in his inner Movement trilogy and I can't wait for the third one. This is another fascinating blend of sci-fi/fantasy novel.<br />We pick up where the first book ended. Can Nate defeat the most powerful government and military the world has ever known with peace and love?<br /><br /> The portal opened onto the dark beach and Wandus greeted Nate and in his wonderful voice the reader can really hear his words of wisdom. \\"You have journeyed long since we last met, my friend. To death and back, to love and betrayal, anger and elation, peaceful victory and violent defeat... yes, you are old in your eyes now.\\" I feel old. I'm lost and confused.\\" He smiled. That is when the greatest treasures are closest.\\" Like many of the mystics who are wise and grand in this book, Wandus is a favorite of mine.<br /><br />Legg is so imaginative and the windows into other dimensions are exciting and filled with so many creative futures and many things can go wrong. There are many great characters that are fully developed, whether loved or hated, they all compliment each other. Each alternate future holds keys to solving who is Lightyear?  I hope many readers of all ages will read this story with many encouraging messages that are throughout both books. Begin with Book 1 \\"Outview\\" it sets the stage. I can't wait for book three as an old favorite enters again. Yay Rose!<br /><br />I received this copy for an honest review and as with the first book I loved it! 5 stars and impatiently waiting for Book 3
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely love this show.  It really pulls you in.  Love the characters and the stories.  Great show to watch. Waiting eagerly for season 4.
B00DYZ2YVG|5.0|With Daniel as our hero in this zombie story, what could possibly go wrong. For starters, his son has died and then his wife, where else would a guy turn? The bottle, this can't be good when there are zombies after you. He does manage to find his strength and do what he needs to do to save the people around him.<br />The characters are all well developed and I came to like many of them, Daniel being my favorite I was shocked and stunned at the end, hoping it wasn't true but it was realistic.<br /><br />I think this is a great take on the zombie revolution that has taken over the world and a great read with a lot of action in between the pages of a love story and un unsung hero.<br /><br />I received this copy for an honest review from the author and I give it 5 zombie stars.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I didn't have a urge to watch this movie even with all the hype and reviews, I sat down and watched it on a rainy day and I'm glad I did, completely different then what I though it would be like from the previews. Great movie.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|There are so many people that use the excuse that they did something wrong because of the way they were brought up, or because of the abuse they suffered as a child.  I was one of those kids that was abused, but I (like Matilda) grew up okay in in spite of it.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I recomand this prodect to anyone it is so cute i got it for my nephew and i wasnt sure he'd like it since he only likes the chupon the hospital gave him and rejects all other but i decided to get it anyway and he loved it XD (chupon means pacifer in spanish)
B002SHD9E2|5.0|My daughter has said for many years that this is one of the best operas she's ever seen & she is right.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|The story is still valid.  Kids are still the same and act bad to each other, yet under it all, they are all the same.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I,ALWAYS check the weather before getting out and also i,look three different places,Alabama where my daughter live,Pennsylvania,my son and Puerto Rico my family.,and always know how they are.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Make sure you have enough HDMI available inputs on your TV.  Understand the applications for this product are limited right now but will grow in the future.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|In all my days of reading books I have never felt so captivated. The trilogy sucked me into a completely different world. I connected with all the characters and it felt as if I was really in the book. I highly recommended this book for every YA reader. I must say the beginnings may be slow but it gets amazing! Don't give up on reading this book if you feel like throwing it at the wall or having a sense of boredom. I also wish I could've read Alex's perspective of the story. In the end I was fully pleased and wanting more. It also left me a bittersweet heartache. Lauren Oliver's writing is fantastic. I hope the trilogy will have the same affect on you.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. It had the right amount of difficultly. I enjoyed how it started easy to get you used to it then it increased in difficultly as you leveled up.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I always loved playing solitary but never ever had the chance of winning like I do in this game! I love this game.<br />Ellenjohnson06@yahoo.com
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I just love the game its fun the only problem I have is you have to wait so long for free tokens to play
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this movie. It really showed different phases of life. It was extremely entertaining even for the adult audience. If ever anyone wants a good movie to watch I will have to recommend this one.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|one of my favorites. Reminded me of the old king stuff special circumstances create opportunities for the character in his book.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie from the beginning and continue to love it. I even named my current cat Simba. Well recommended
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|If you like supernatural creatures, Victorians, and strong women you will love these books. All five are equally entertaining and readable.
B0000714BP|5.0|Always loved this film and wanted for my collection.  Amazon.com offered for fair price and great service.  Film arrived earlier than quoted delivery time & date.  Overall very satisfied with product and surprised by Amazon.Com's great customer service.  Thank you.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|It won't be winning any awards, but it was a lot of fun to watch. I need five more words.
B00AK77WPE|4.0|Great DVD concert. Do wish, the cd wouldve contained all the songs from the DVD. Only 3 songs were not on the cd,  but they're classics.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|What can I say!  I love James Rollins writing of the Sigma Force novels.  His unique twist and turns along with the strange science that he incorporates into every book makes these a great read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a good game if you love horses and it feels like you really have an horse to take care of, the game do not freeze or turn off !!!
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I have a bathroom light that my kids can't reach to turn on. So we got this to light up the bathroom at night. I love the motion censor. It works great. It lights up the bathroom enough for them to use it and head back to bed. My only issue with it was the strip that attaches to the wall didn't hold the light up. The light ended up falling off the wall and into the toilet. Even after my kid flushed it it still worked. We just put a command strip in it and it has stayed up for over two months now.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|I expect I will, once I've played it, feel like giving the recording a 4-5 star rating, but at the moment I'm still trying to arrange the tracks in sequence, having just used the Amazon Cloud Player to download them to my computer (the physical CD is still on its way in the mail).<br /><br />For reasons I cannot imagine, the track numbers do not display in the Cloud Player, but it has clearly placed the Finale first (its title contains the word \\"Finale\\"), and plays it first when I ask it to play the album.  Since the titles alone, without track numbers, don't give me any clues, I had to search out the directory where the download landed to see if I could straighten this out.  (I could also have gone to the \\"sales\\" web page where the samples are listed in correct sequence.)<br /><br />I find that the whole album has downloaded WITH the correct track numbers on the file names, BUT EACH ONE has \\"01\\" appended in front of the actual track number; I gather the Cloud Player thus has no way to put them in order, it thinks they're all \\"01.\\"  So, you do get the download along with the physical CD, but prepare to have to deal with unpredictable Cloud Player track numbers.  With an album that has a storyline, not a good situation.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The only thing I did not like or would have expected to be better is the way it gets hot for couple of hours usage making me think how long the device will last if regularly used for longer hours.
B008476HBM|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect but found this book very enjoyable and readable. It's a lovely story of love and family, and changed misconceptions. I am sure there are much more erudite reviews than mine but I quite enjoyed this story.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can't get enough of DA..... Wonderful Season.... sad, romantic, serious, funny,  Every emotion is felt with this yr.... LOVE IT
B0035JNTA6|1.0|it was funny in the beginning, but the slapstick and lack of intelligence got old fast. Even the 15 year said it was &#34;weird&#34;.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I am not familier with sharping devices or even stones on how to do. So I bought this to learn with along with some cheap knifes. Looks good feels sturdy, it is small so you really have to pay attention (as you would anyway) to what you were doing.. I think for the price and what you get for a beginer, its a great item.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|the story line was hard to get into. I found that it did not keep my attention until I was almost finished
140006922X|5.0|Fascinating book. Aslan put twenty years of research into Zealot. Finally someone has made some sense of the man Jesus and how a religion was built around him. It was interesting enough that I may read it again.
B00B0HXC4I|3.0|Took a gamble based on some reviews I read. Not big on this genre of metal, but some of the songs are melodic. TI prefer the newer album.
B0026KX5PO|5.0|Really surprisingly bizarre and entertaining. Matt Damon was incredible. I'd definitely recommend highly, for adults - very engaging and entertaining throughout.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is SO addictive. Good thing I have to work every day or I would be stuck on it all the time. :) Just wish you didn't have to pay actual money for stuff. They should make it where you earn it all. Very fun though.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|The Marware case was more than I expected!  I thought I was just getting a cover for my new Kindle but it is good looking, not bulky and easy to use!  I highly recommend it!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Superb.  Quick read,  I felt part of the book as I read it. If you're a fan of great storytelling read this book
1439102813|5.0|Highly recommend this book for anyone with a family member suffering from this terrible disease. It's fiction, but written by a professor of neurology, so it's based on fact and her experience in seeing it firsthand. Alice is a combination of the patients she's seen over the years.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a novel worth savoring.  I read it in a couple days, and it was fun to get lost in.  Mr. Landay makes it easy to insert yourself into his characters thoughts and live with them, and you really don't want to at times.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great ebook reader for your android device when your Kindle is at home. Works perfectly and updates itself with each improvement. I highly recommend this.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|This is not a light hearted laugh out loud fluffy comedy.  It is a thought provoking look at people who have to deal with mental &#34;diagnoses&#34;.<br /><br />Watch it and plan to go eat dinner afterwards for discussion!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Many sounds to send you into a peaceful sleep or mediation. Nice program with many features and adjustments. I recommend this program to anyone that likes to relax and sleep peacefully.
B00EEXST2K|3.0|This movie was not as good that I thought it would be. Chloe  was a much better movie.<br />thank you
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I would recommend this book to you, spoiler alert Percy Jackson almost falls into tartarus  and then the next book look interesting.
B000I3PERS|4.0|I've seen this movie several times.  It has always been one of my favorites.  The movie was not choppy .  All in all great presentation.
B009AMAGQM|3.0|Just very interesting.  My daughter seemed to like it, but she a teen into all the vampire, werewolf and witches stuff.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Love this movie.  Great follow up to the first remake.  Chris Pine and Zach Quinto are perfect as Kirk and Spock.  Can't wait for the next one!
B005LAIH2C|3.0|It was a good movie overall...just lots of blood and guts.  If you have a weak stomach, try to avoid it.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|A very well written and researched book. It's sort of Laura Hillerbrand meets Robert Ludlum. There's moments that read like great literature and there's less serious parts that feel like movie scenes. A strange hybrid but very entertaining and I for one am hooked on the series. Looking forward to Operation Parsifal!
B005LAII44|3.0|WHY DID THEY HAVE TO KILL DUKE!!!  Over-all it was a good movie,  guess I was expecting more.  And the punchlines are weak.  Bring back the original cast.
B00CEF014E|5.0|This book is a mind-bender! I want to go to Rainbow and spend time with Clive Cole, Zoe Barnes, Dana and the creepy guy who lives in the walls. Read this book - it will mess you up. I loved it. Great stuff.
B0018AOA0C|5.0|My favorite Kyuss album.<br /> Their 3rd album released in '94.<br /> there's so much talent going into this recording. It's just one of those perfect moments where the right people all met at the right time and place,and for one brief shining moment there was Kyuss.
B00795P4EG|5.0|It is easy to use and has easy to understand directions.  It does a great  job of removing unwanted objects in a picture.
B00BCOGM78|4.0|Clutch is one of my all time favorites, with that being said I'm not as fond of this offering as I am with most all of their others.<br /> although the sound quality is good the song writing seems thrown together and smacks of company band.<br /> I am happy for clutch to put out any album and there are good songs on here,with mr freedom being my fav track.<br /> I know Clutch is very busy as they never seem to stop touring, but I for one would be happy to see them take a few months off and put out a more thoughtful and wonderfully strange Clutch album.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I got this usb cable along with the plug that has the amazon logo on it. Don't know if there is a difference if you connect the cable to a different plug piece. But since the combo charges my devices really fast there is no need to find out.. Its definitely a 'worth it' buy
B0018B1OG4|5.0|for the discerning rock lover who's not down with radio music.<br /> this album passes the acid test and then some.<br /> Kyuss was ahead of their time with everything from writing to production.<br /> These old albums satisfy the part of you that's looking for something original and different,except that it leaves you wanting more Kyuss.
B003K15IF8|5.0|John Williams writes one of the few novels of the last 50 years that digs into the realities of Everyman's life with nary a gimmick nor a weird turn of events. Stoner's story unfolds through the 3rd person's voice. And what a voice it is--a writer who makes extraordinary events of an ordinary man wrestling ordinary events, a most ordinary Everyman. There are no cliffhanger moments & yet Williams moves us through Professor Stoner's life without wasting a word. I read it in two sittings because I couldn't put it down. Anyone who aspires to authorship should delve into John Williams's stuff.
B0013AWVQW|5.0|A dynasty within themselves, dating back to '85 with 10 albums under their belt(the latest in '09).<br /> it's only about rock&roll no politics no sex no religion...just let me ask you, how loud is your stereo?
B00ESY77LO|1.0|I couldn't wait for it to end! Thought it would be better from the trailers. Would find anything else to watch, like the grass growing.
B00598Y414|5.0|all Maiden is created equally...<br /> But, this album stands apart as the sound quality of this live recording is phenomenal as well well as their flawless performance at long beach CA in '85.<br /> Maiden still teaches us that anyone can go into a studio and sound like whatever they want but playing it live in front of countless thousands and nailing it through the heart is what real talent and musicianship is all about!
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Huge die hard fan..... Not this one! Was very disappointed in the direction they decided to take this movie, felt like it just got right into it and never explained any thing along the way
B0051YDTKS|5.0|Need I say more?...RANDY!<br /> ThoughBlizz is over 30 years old now,it still remains relevant and carries as much(if not more) impact than it did in 1980.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|Not all blu rays actually have good high definition quality but this one looks fantastic on a big screen.<br />And we love this movie--Never give up, Never Surrender!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved it. Great romance novel. I read it in one day! Totally worth a read... Walking disaster is great too!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I am a fan of the original series, all those in between, and the movies.  This movie was probably 4th from the top of my Star Trek movie list.  My least favorite Star Trek movies were ST 5 and the latest new cast knockoff of ST 2.  Robbing lines and plot from another Star Trek movie just makes it cheap.  This movie was both original and pretty good.
B0019LZV4E|4.0|if you like Depp and musicals you will love this ... it is just dirty and gritty enough to bring it back from being funny
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Love love love this book... Ifemelu's experience was so relatable to me. I couldn't put this down. Thanks Chimamanda for recounting our story. The African immigrant story so eloquently
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Not much play value here. I can't see why anyone would buy extra coins, which seems to be the only reason for this games existence.
B0078XHAB4|4.0|A nice little book with 2 tragedies and how they are handled. A bit long for my taste, but fine anyway.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Its a great album from start to end. If you are a fan of Stone Sour's older stuff, I highly advise getting this CD!
B004EWFV9K|5.0|I just love the way Mankell makes the Kurt Wallander come alive. He is not glamorous, he is just a flawed human being, but a &#34;good guy&#34; at the same time. I am unbelievably sad that this was his last book! But, of course, it could not last forever. I would have liked a happiet ending, but I suppose that is unrealistic!
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Love this movie! So beautiful and the message is one I fully support!  Great for all ages - my 3 year old loved it!
B004LWZW4W|4.0|By far the best since the original! I loved it and recommend it for all animal lovers.  Mankind deserves exactly what he gets in this movie.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Like any interesting book, particularly those that involve some form of adventure, this can keep you reading when you should be sleeping, working, eating, washing the baby, etc.<br />McDougall did a good job entertaining and his editors did a pretty good job preventing him from carry things to far off in various directions.  I appreciate that he was not a major character in his book, but that he was were he needed to be to make it come to life.<br />There's definitely one standout chapter that could be debatable as far as evolution/design/creation theory, but is still quite interesting.  (I would be interested to read input from creation/design perspective- in either camp we at some point had to outrun danger and run down food, so the 'born to run' theory still works)<br />This book definitely inspired me; making me want to run more than my normal 6-10 miles, regardless of weather and terrain, and at the same time, sip Tecate and devour homemade Mexican food.<br />I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in running, sports, adventure, endurance and the human body, and really just enjoying life in general.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved the book one and book two of the century trilogy, both are fantastic. I just couldn’t stop reading them.<br />I always enjoy Ken Follett Books, and I read most of them.<br />Nevertheless for me the best ones are the ones from the century trilogy.<br />This book is well written, has a great story and I learn a lot about history.<br />Thank you for this great book. I’m looking forward for the third book.
1444737112|5.0|This was the most delightful and inspiring book I have read in a long, long time. And what made it even better is that it<br />is a true story. It just touched my heart. I couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end........absolutely wonderful!!
B00B9366VO|5.0|This is a really well done movie. For musicians, you'll just love it. For music fans, you'll probably love it, too. I think it's interesting for everyone. The music is great, the mix is fantastic - it sounds REALLY good. The story sounds like it would be pretty boring. A movie about a recording studio, actually, more accurately, it's about a mixing console. But add in all the interesting side-stories, the things that rock and roll dreams are made of, and you've got a really good movie.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|WE love them and recommend them to everyone, they are very funny, especially the owner of the farm. Looking forward to the next seasons.
034580404X|5.0|This is a must read for over 21. Really good plot., keeps you reading to get to the end faster!!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Nothing to dislike. The acting, writing, directing and set/scenery are hands down perfect. Not your mom's cop show.... Not to be missed.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|Best movie ever. Was insitant and the quality was great. I would reccomend this movie to all families and children.
B000053W01|5.0|Returns me to my youth, lol.  I love listening to this music, I could listen to it over and over and over, but then my husband would got nuts without his music!  She died way to young, that is for a fact.  But then again, we really did not understand or have a strong hold on her illness at that time, perhaps we could have caught it sooner, or had more information on the signs if we did.  At least we have her music to remember her by. and that's as best a memorial as I can think of for such a fine lady.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Disregard the reviews that are critical because it has ads.  There are no ads in the game, only a splash screen that shows other available games.  Just click Play and you are on your way to the best Mahjong game ever published.  Awesome graphics and music plus 3 different ways to play.  It doesn't get any better than this.
B00AB0NTTI|5.0|I watch this movie probably once a year because it makes me laugh everytime. it is a great spoof and the cast makes it better.
B000025RX4|5.0|I've had an almost life-long admiration for Johnny Winter.  Had this on vinyl and just wore it out.  Replaced it with the CD
B008OOYALE|4.0|I just wish all the apple perks of this game were available for the kindle...otherwise I would have given 5 stars
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Bingo Blitz really is fun except when the free space power ups rip me off by landing on the called numbers which happens all the time. grrrrrrr
1594746036|5.0|One of the first books in a long time that I have asked everyone if they have read it!!  HIGHLY recommend!!  Very visual!  Can't wait for the movie!!
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|More information on levels would be more appreciate. But in general is a challenging game that defy gravity in the virtual world of your phone.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|beautifully written, the story intertwines the lives of very interesting characters. As I have with his first 2 novels, I enjoyed this book from cover to cover.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is great for me and my kids it is also great for on the go it is amazing
B007FXLWKW|5.0|it was adorable.  i always watch it with the kids when they are bored. i highly recommend it for the young and the old
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|it was a good movie worth watching and great songs worth hearing i would definately suggest buying this movie for your family
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|loved this more than the wizard of oz.  it was a great story!  the china doll was so adorable.  i want a doll like her!  all of the characters were great.  i think i liked it more than the kids.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I like it. Im never bored while playiny this. Its my favoritr game jn thr world. Very mysterious. I like passcodes and junk like thar
B003DNN0L2|2.0|my 4 year old's attention was not held by this film.  maybe a boy would like it more.  it had its moments but overall, it wasn't that great.  i appreciated it more as an adult
B00005JN0T|2.0|Out of boredom on a long flight, I watched \\"I, Robot\\" - the Will Smith version. This is one of the worst movies I have seen, on many levels. The plot promotes a fear of technologies that could never be developed by 2035, and would not work like this in any case.  Will Smith's part is an anti-robot bigot (as in the hate and paranoia kind). The lead female was smart and strong at the beginning, but gradually reverted to a dummy who was mostly around to get saved. The Chicago where this takes place bears no resemblance to today's Chicago, so we should perhaps assume that between now and 2035, Chicago will be bulldozed and rebuilt with ugly modern skyscrapers.<br /><br />Worst of all, they set it up for a sequel. Yuck-o! I wouldn't waste my time, even on an airplane.  Not after this mess.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|GREAT COVER FOR MY KINDLE.  EAST TO  CARY IN MY PURSE. OR EVEN WITHOUT A PURSE.  IT IS SO  EASY TO HANDLE THE KINDLE.  THANKYOU
B004SIIBGU|3.0|clean interface that looks good but I can't find my saved searches. Pretty nice to monitor the things I want to track though.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|One of Jane eyre's last novels has been cast beautifully. The characters are so believable that I get sucked into their world every time!Must watch for a romantic die-hard
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is highly addictive. I wasn't sure that I was going to like it but after half way through season one I was hooked.  I can't wait until season 4.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I love this movie.  It is a great family movie that makes me feel like a kid again. Love watching it over and over!
B002PZJOCS|2.0|still waiting for the mentalist to come down from the amazon cloud now 30 minutes later.  Amazon wouldn't update the address on my cards, then when the purchase went through, my tv is stuck.  Great job guys, now falling asleep.  I think I will stick with netflix for now.
B001B67VR2|4.0|It makes a nice addition to my shuffle play of a few hundred of songs, was a good buy for the special price.
B00CL151G4|5.0|We missed seeing the pilot episode when it was first shown. This set of DVD's includes the pilot and other interesting episodes. Each episode is as fresh and new as when we first watched them during the season. Well worth having our own set.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|I thought it was different and fairly refreshing.  The music is soothing to me, but would be nice if there were more variety in style.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Unless you use your KindleFire like you use your iphone don't bother. This app with just annoy you otherwise. At least it did me.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|It's an interesting time period so I was excited to start the series.  The characters are growing on me, at least most of them.  Love the mother!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Okay this is the 3rd book of the Mortal Instruments series and it was great!!! I love the world Cassandra Clare creates!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It's adorable.  Kids and adults will enjoy!  I watched it alone and wished my husband or kids would have been able to enjoy it with me.  I'll watch it again with them!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I impulsively downloaded it thinking it was something else. But its a game and I didn't need or want another game so I deleted it.
B00DF92E7U|3.0|Nothing impressive, few older redone songs by Stills, good guitar work by Kenny Waybe Shepherd but overall slightly disappointed.<br />With the combination of the two artists, whom I both like, I expected far more.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The 2nd book of the Mortal Instruments series was simply amazing. I couldn't put it down! I was completely sucked in and finished the book in under a week!
B00874T02K|5.0|Great application only down side is not giving any variance to types of pushups. Other than that it is amazing.
B00A757EFW|4.0|If you're getting fed up with Angry Birds, and looking for something nestalgic this is it. Its great for passing the time.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|U should git this app because it is interesting and fun and cool I am surprise that people don't like this app
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I remember looking through the books at Target and thinking I'd like to read this book about 2 yrs ago. But when I noticed that a movie was coming out based on it I quickly ordered the book for my KindleFire and started reading it. It was GREAT! I mean I read the book in a week! I'm usually a slow reader, reading only at night before bed, but I couldn't put this ebook down! I was sucked into the world Cassandra Clare created and in all my nerdiness found myself wanting her world to be my reality! I<br /><br />***Friendly note of advice though (about movie adaptation):<br />If you're planning on watching the movie you'll be very disappointed. I know I was. The movie cuts out some of the most interesting parts of the book! :( I would be more than happy if production companies would stay true to the books! I mean I don't care if the movie is three hours long as its good and I don't feel like I wasted the money. For example LOTR or HP: The movies were long but stayed very true to the books and I left the theater feeling satisfied and looking forward to the next movies. For me this movie was a complete let down.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|It was funny and worth the money and give stars. I recommend it. I'll definitely buy more and finish the series
B009WO7NQO|5.0|WARNING!! This game can be very addictive. Its just so freaking fun and the birds adapted to look like beloved Star Wars characters with Jedi like powers fighting against Darth Vader and his cohorts is just too funny. I downloaded the game for me and ended up in a &#34;war&#34; over possession for my KindleFire with my husband! Its a game for all ages and I haven't met one person who doesn't love it!
B008469DGY|5.0|Learn back spin early and curve. Closer to hole you use it better it works. I really enjoyed this game and graphics a great too!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Well done. And an ending I didn't expect but won't soon forget. Can't wait to see what the next book has in store!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I have enjoyed hidden object games but the games by Nevosoft are sophisticated and enjoyable.<br />Thanks and keep producing the series! PS The dragon puzzle 17-3 was hard but rewarding.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|A wonderful, heartwarming story about a bond between a man and a cat, but not overly sweet.  I read it in one sitting.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|My husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed watching all of these again, in order and at our leisure.  The quality of the HD is amazing, the acting superb, the stories compelling.  Thanks for another one, J.J. Abrams!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Even if I´m no longer in my teen years I absolutely love the book. It was a book after realy, realy long time, that I just cannot put away even if it was 2 a.m. in the morning :D<br /><br />Funny thing is, that I started with The Mortal Instruments series only after I was in the cinema to see the first movie. But I think it helped a little bit, because the way Jamie C.B. play Jace´s character is unbelievable and I can acctualy picture him as Jace as I´m reading next books in the series.<br /><br />So as I see it, I won´t be able to sleep properly in next few days :D
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I got this game not knowing what to expect, but had a blast!! The game was frustrating at times, but was worth sticking with it!!  The directions could have explained what to do better, but the game was easy enough to figure out. Awesome!!
0375826742|5.0|a book for my mom in law she enjoyed and for the price now that was awesome will b ordering from u again
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I'm a huge mlp fan and this is much better than I expected. Great Job Gameloft. GET THIS GAME NOW!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this Rio angry birds....addicting and oh sooooo fun !! keeps me totally entertained , love the sounds the birds make...
B000HL2J0G|3.0|Used to view this program years ago and thought the gadgetry was fantastic and really enjoyed watching, but now with all the modern movies surpassing anything MacGyver used to do it is just a journey down memory lane.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|was so addicted every free moment was spent watching this show. now just waiting for season 5 to be on prime!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series and can't wait for Season 4 to be available. Not happy with my favorite characters getting killed off the series though.
B00CZAYOWI|5.0|I agree with Josh's review in that Electric was the weaker link between Love and Sonic Temple albums. Peace continues the signature hypnotic guitar rhythms found on Love, but with more evolved hard rock touches. \\" Love Removal Machine \\" and \\" Wild Flower \\" sound liked improved songs- much more catchier. Hints of Fire Woman in the Zap City intro. I respect the band's decision for a cleaner sound but wished Peace was the choice in 1986/87. This is the album that should have been released.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was great.  It isn't your typical love story, it has so many other factors and story lines along with it.  It is sort of like a mystery as well.  Already on book 2.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Bought this for our Grandson, and he enjoyed it as much as we did. Great feel good movie, and suitable for all ages.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Makes the current Hostess closing and twinkie shortage a bit too real.  Woody is straight-up funny and makes the movie for me.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|I have most of the solo albums from both Trucks and Tedeschi - I like Tedeschi's better than a lot of the Derek Trucks albums (I was not a big fan of his world music mixed with blues).  This album is just great, it is so easily listenable, the songs do not require you to study them to appreciate the musicianship like a lot of Derek's albums.  The bigger band fills out the sound so well that it really sets a great stage for Susan's vocals.  The sound is much richer than her solo albums.  Compared to Revelator this album is just better - better songs, better production, and it just sounds to me like it was recorded by a really tight band having a lot of fun.  I like most of the songs, but from me the stand out is All That I Need - just awesome.  If you like blues fronted by a soulful female voice and backed by great slide guitar, horns, and an awesome rhythm section then this album is for you.
1844137872|5.0|Great collection of Banksy's work with some stories of his intertwined.  I love how his work makes you think with the satirical political pieces.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I loved the HP series (I read them to my children as they were growing up).  It is THE most fun I've ever had reading a story.  So, when JK Rowling had another literary offering, I wanted to read it.  I was looking forward to finding out what she would write for adults.<br /><br />TCV was well written, naturally.  Character development was great, but SO diverse in such a short period of time that I was left confused. Despite being an avid reader my whole life, I found myself really struggling to keep all of these characters straight (wait...WHO is that again?...that sort of thing).<br /><br />And I think this was my biggest disappointment.  It was so hard to figure out who was who that I didn't *care* about ANY of these characters until the book was nearly over (I was, literally, 65% finished with the book before I finally had a grasp on character identities).  I've always felt that Rowling blows many other authors out of the water with her talent for character development...it's kind of my favorite thing about her writing.  As such, I kept really trying to get a firm grasp on the characters from TCV.  There were a couple of characters whom I really cared about by the end of the story, but by then...for at least one of them...it was too late.  I never really got to enjoy them *during* the story.<br /><br />And....I *hate* to say it...but when it was all said and done...I found the story to be, overall, pretty boring.<br /><br />I still love Rowling as a writer.  I just didn't connect much with this particular story.
0399159347|4.0|I thought this was a good book - at the end of each chapter, I didn't want to stop reading.  There are some nice twists in the book to keep you interested.  Perfect for summer reading!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|the game gives you a feeling that your in ww 2. Its got some good sound effects and good smoke effects.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|Always reluctant to spend money on a game without testing it first but a few trusted people told me it reminded them of Diablo and I was sold. I have probably played 100 + hours on my Fire HD with about 20 shutdowns, so not completely unreasonable just annoying as they seem to come when I am close to beating someone.
1451695195|3.0|Book was ok - but delved mostly into the medical journey rather than spiritually of what happened to the author with his near death experience.  Guess this would be expected from a neurosurgeon author.  Worth reading.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|It was wonderful to watch even with children present! I found the movie as interesting as the original one and is instantly one of my faves!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It's a Kinda realistic game not as much as I liked to see but far more realistic than be1-3 or cod 1-5<br />Anyway still good game
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|This season kept me on the edge of my seat in every episode. I think I watched the whole season in less than a week.
B006LSZECO|4.0|While some friends suggested that the ending left them wanting more, I felt it teed up a sequel nicely. I thought the character development was outstanding, and I really didn't know who did what until towards the end. It kept me coming back and longing to turn the page. In a sick way, I found her romantic gesture very alluring, and I borrowed the scavenger hunt concept for a recent anniversary with my wife (she hasn't read it yet). Highly recommend and I hope Flynn follows up.
1451626096|4.0|Philippa Gregory headed into more familiar territory in this latest book.  It serves as a bridge to fill the gap between the Plantagenets and her beloved Tudor Court novels.  It tells the story of Princess Elizabeth, heir to the line of York, and queen of the new conquering king Henry VII.  She is a fascinating character in history: the only queen to be daughter, sister, niece, wife, and mother of kings.  She was a peace offering to gain the support of Henry Tudor against her usurping uncle, and to bind the houses of Lancaster and York together and end the War of the Roses.<br /><br />Once again, Gregory breathes life into a well-known historical figure, shedding light on her probable inner thoughts and conflict.  After all, this was the girl who enjoyed such favour in her uncle's court, now forced to marry her enemy, and to stand by him against conspirators from her own family.  The author does a fantastic job developing this tension, never flinching away from the raw feeling and delicately drawing the reader along with Elizabeth in her transformation from York to Tudor.<br /><br />I loved the book, as always, and I can't wait to read more, and I hear there's another book in the works, based on Elizabeth's cousin Margaret Pole.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|We use it all the time when traveling on the motorcycle.  I don't have a smartphone so my kindle does the job for me.
B00AKKS278|5.0|This was my first dive into the genre of \\"self help\\" books but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I look forward to starting my new routine tomorrow morning.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is like reading a book, taking a worldwide trip/cruise, watching a cooking show, at a runway show, peeking a beautiful people, and most of all a fantasy taken from you creative mind down on virtual paper.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|It was a great read! It was hard to put it down. I look forward to reading the other PRIDE books.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|love another way to listen to my music without having to use the dreaded ITunes, and that's such a relief
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Do you like pirates? Do you like treasure? Do you like adventure? Do you like pirates? You might like this book. It is a good tale but is not riveted with fast pace action. There is tension. There is danger. There are pirates. It is a quick read for a classic with simple language that will take your imagination to exotic and fun locations. And there are pirates.
B00138H0H4|5.0|This sounds like the chick from Concrete Blonde, Johnette Napolitano, but it's NOT.  It's Brandi Carlile, who has that same squeak in her voice when she belts it out that I sooo wish I could imitate.  But not luck.  LOVE this song!
B000GCFBQU|5.0|It's with remarkable emotion and grief,  that I leave these last pages of writings by Elizabeth Sprout. She managed to bring me from laughter to tears, anguish to relief, depth of emotion to redemption of heart, all in one quick read of Abide with Me.  Thank you Elizabeth.  Your book brought a healing and new understanding to my soul.
B00AYB0YFQ|3.0|Stupid wacky fun that spoofs scream, know what you did last summer, and teen films. Crude humor all throughout! Yeah!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It was an interesting book, but not as good as The Kite Runner. Very sad story  to read.I am glad I read it.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I like 10 out of the 12 songs here so that's a great thing. I like the singles \\"The Way\\" and \\"Baby I\\" as well as many other tracks like \\"Honeymoon Avenue\\" (my absolute favorite track; I gush over this one EVERY TIME), \\"Right There\\", \\"Tattooed Heart\\", \\"Lovin' It\\", \\"Daydreamin'\\", \\"You'll Never Know\\" and \\"Almost Is Never Enough\\". \\"Popular Song\\" with Mika is alright but it doesn't really fit with the album's sound. Mika also sounds a little insane in the chorus. o_o I would have preferred another big ballad in its place (this album doesn't seem to have enough of them!). \\"Piano\\" is really cute (after it grew on me) and although it feels out of place musically \\"Better Left Unsaid\\" is solid pop.<br /><br />I can see her having at least 2 more hits from this album. Vocally she is on point. Lots of belting and whistle register notes that break through the ceiling. Production is almost always perfect too. In the end this is a very, VERY good Pop/R&B album. I can't say I'm disappointed. Before the album came out I was absolutely obsessed with \\"Baby I\\" and have played it around 100x since I found out about it. That song is kinda wearing on me now but that's OK. The album is still pretty good.<br /><br />P.S. I wish a final studio version of \\"Boyfriend Material\\" would have made the album. That's like her most chipper song to date in the vein of what \\"Piano\\" brings mood-wise.<br /><br />4.6 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Honeymoon Avenue\\"<br />\\"You'll Never Know\\"<br />\\"Lovin' It\\"<br />\\"The Way\\" &<br />\\"Piano\\"
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Maybe I'm too old, but it seemed to far fetched for me, I know that the author is a children's writer and maybe it seemed too much k like a child's book than an adult's.
B00CO4KGYA|1.0|Waste of time and a waste of money. This app would be okay for 5 yr olds however its too violent for them
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I loved the part when she put the flowers around Rue and looked at the camera. Awesome yeah yes yes
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Vanessa Diffenbaugh tells the story of a child of the foster-care system in California. She is abused by foster parents and, as a result, self - destructs  in life because she has no trust of others and no self-esteem.  This destruction continues through an appalling list of self-imposed hardships. Amazingly her unlikely knowledge of the Victorian symbology of flowers helps her build a successful business and everyone ends up happily ever after.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Not really built for machetes, for knives and pocket multitools is ok. For traveling is ok because the ligth weigth.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is the beginning book to the hunger games trilogy.  The movies all take elements from the book, so if you want more detail than what is offered in the movie, consult the book.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a good hidden object game but I'm not sure if I understand all of the undertones yet. It's definitely different from the other hidden object games I've played up until now.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|It's so much fun and I love not having to be on a timer. It's really relaxing to play and I can stop at any time and just pick it up later right where I left off.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is very Interesting.  It is good for  traveller in the plane.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />No more comment.
0061729078|5.0|I love how much certain writers can get into detail ! About his life through this experience, a bit hard to read but it is totally worth it.
B00479SVBU|4.0|have no real issue with this product.  you do have to remember to remove it before you start your vehicle though, or you will blow a fuse.  it even comes with an extra fuse, so be mindful that you have to remember!
B008469DGY|1.0|The game is very boring. Even for free I don't know how this is rated so high. Game looks good but the controls feel off. Uninstalled
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game is very fun and exciting! I would give this game 5 stars but it constantly times out which is irritating but other than that the game is very addicting. there is always something to do.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|This is the 'real' nine inch nails, folks. This album could easily have been released after 'the fragile' and it would have been a perfect follow-up. Only now after a decade plus since the height of NIN mania, it sounds more modern and mature, like a grown up 'fragile'. You can even hear many of the same unique sounds and instruments, but used in a different context, amidst head-bobbing beats.<br /><br />The album sizzles out of the gate and then settles in to a seriously enchanting second half. It gives you everything: the hits, the noise, and the uncertain.<br /><br />Quite frankly, Hesitation Marks is the mature nin comeback album I have been waiting for. It will cement trent reznor's legacy as a legitimate rock icon forever. This album bridges the quality work from the 90's to now, correcting some of the misdirection of recent years. And what is exciting to me is that people really seem to care. To those who are looking for a rehash of broken or downward spiral, we already have those records. Life is supposed to be about evolving...<br /><br />Welcome back, nine inch nails!! You 'came back haunted' and I'm so proud to be a nin fan...
140006922X|1.0|S-o-o-o, you want to learn about Jesus, the man; & you wind up going to an ex-Christian/ follower of Islam, a belief system who denies the Diety of Jesus, & however this works, believes if faithful to allah, when one dies there will be a bevy of beautiful babes, as in harum scarum (thanks to Elvis, I suppose) awaiting thee, to orgy with. Funny, Islam doesn't dote much on what awaits the female sector of our population; hope there's no lesbian hanky-panky going on here, oh, but, that's right, I forgot... in Islam, women don't count. Back to Reza (I refuse to acknowledge him as 'Aslan', out of respect to C.S. Lewis), his tiresome logic makes for an excellent candidate choice in regards to 1st Corinthians 2:14-16: 'But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one. For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.' Reza is destined to fall on his face, as does the so-called 'Jesus Siminar' & various other heretics who attempt to 'reason out' God's Word, which boldly declares It is written & inspired by the Holy Spirit of God & MUST be spiritually discerned. I dipped in around the center of this man's tripe, & there he was berating the inspiring Apostle Paul, no less... doubting his apostleship (he only wrote about two-thirds of the New Testament, thru inspiration of the Holy Spirit of course). For a start therein, the contradiction Reza comes to accuse Paul of is executed all over the place in Reza's own scribble. He refers to Paul as on an 'entirely self-ascribed mission to the gentiles', after recounting 'Jesus chose Paul before he was born, called by Jesus into apostleship while still in his mother's womb (Galatians 1:15)... doesn't sound self-ascribed in my Book. Then Reza claims Paul contradicts Jesus by saying 'everyonewho calls upon the Name of the Lord, will be saved'(Romans 10:13), when Jesus proclaims in Matthews' Gospel,'Not everyone who says to me 'Lord,Lord' shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven (Matthew 7:21) O-o-o-o-h!... I'm aware of several 6-year olds that can decipher that in Romans the Holy Spirit is regarding those who do so sincerely, & in Matthew, the Holy Spirit is regarding those who address Jesus' Lordship insincerely (as Reza attempts w/ this book, although oddly enough he lets it slide in this instance, regarding Jesus' Lordship, in order to get in the 'licks' on Paul). Reza doesn't refer much to the Scripture in Peter's final analysis of writings when in wisdom he suggests we 'go to Paul'(Second Peter 3:15, 16), for Peter well knew that the Apostle Paul had it going on. This Reza-farce is just common, garden-variety, heretical blasphemous, pagan rubbish, destined for the garbage bin of 'Jesus siminar' & other base heretics denying the Sovereign Diety of Christ Jesus... satanic ploy intended to stupify its reader~ Larry Changes  (Note: If truly interested in serious works on the humanity of Jesus, these are highly suggested to be rewarding: Exploring the Gospel of Luke/ John Phillips Commentary * The Hidden Years at Nazareth/ G. Campbell Morgan * The Jesus I Never Knew/ Philip Yancey * The Mind of Jesus/ William Barclay * The Crises of the Christ/ G. Campbell Morgan)
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I'm a huge Dave Grohl fan so I was pretty much destined to like this, and wasn't disappointed.  That said, this film was so much more than Mr. Grohl and Nirvana.  The music emerging from that grungy, smelly studio was phenomenal and the history behind it all is fascinating.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book puts the life of Jesus in historical perspective.  I learned things I had never heard before.  Zealot reads like a novel.
0783229526|1.0|This was a hot mess. Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors, but he really stunk in this role and he wasn't the only one that stunk. The whole movie was terrible and bored me to pieces. Summary.....just a really bad quality movie with lots of hype IMO.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|This is one of those great bands that everyone should hear. It is the best new &#34;supergroup&#34; since Chickenfoot. Everyone needs to hear this CD.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love everything Michael Connelly writes and this one keeps you guessing until the end.  Harry Bosch as the main character truly lives his beliefs. His compassion is felt by the reader and you just keep cheering for him!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I have this app on my iphone too. is amazing how you can keep up to date reading about the things you care about.<br />Soo easy to use. kudos for flipboard.<br />GY
B00004YRQA|5.0|This memory card was so much cheaper (even with very low cost shipping & handling) than buying a new one from a store, and just as good!
B007AL48UK|2.0|Nothing different or exciting. Same old same old. Ok for free. Already deleted it .Don't bother with it. Not a fan.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The story line is really engaging and full of humour.  The location shooting in a retirement home is quite good.  The jump from one scene to another is not always seamless and is not a natural flow.
B0053O8AQE|4.0|Enjoyed the first season of this show a lot and bought it for my bestie as a present! Laughs continue!
B0073L91MW|3.0|He was the best part of this movie. Good representation of what our Men & Women in Uniform sacrifice for us both then & now.
B00136NUG6|5.0|Oldies but goodies, classic Earth, Wind, and Fire. Takes you back a ways and offers a different, enjoyable listening experience. I would recommend this CD for anyone looking a collection of their greatest hits, they are all there.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Sometimes you get the feeling that you are going thru this life by yourself and no one gets it. Nice to know...Someone gets it. Kinda funny it's a Cat. James Done Good work here...
B008469DGY|3.0|It is a nice game at first and a bit addictive. However, as many already pointed out, no course play and it gets boring very fast. As a free app of the day, it is a nice game. Paying for it, even 99&cent; is not worth it in my honest opinion.
1595827684|5.0|I'm glad I finally got around to buying this book. Mass Effect basically brought back my love of video games a few years ago. I've been hooked and buying up all the merchandise I could ever since. The universe that these guys at Bioware were able to dream up is phenomenal. The amount of detail is great and if you enjoy just admiring the views in the games as much as the gameplay itself then this is something you will enjoy. The book itself is great quality and printed on nice paper to really bring out more of the clarity in the images. It's great seeing some of the early concept art for characters and seeing what some of them could've been. The book spans the entire trilogy which is nice seeing how certain art evolved. Ultimately what they decided on is perfect in my eyes making each race and planet/homeworld seem unique in their own way. Speaking as a fan of the games, I can't wait to see where Mass Effect goes from here and of course to see more of the incredibly detailed art that inspires it. The next iteration of this book should be just as great.
B00DB31Y3U|2.0|Was a nice game at the beginning, but then gets boring after a while. Overall, can get some good play out of it, but be prepared to get bored soon.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|love,love,loved it!, just as good as the old school one, but better, if you have not seen this movie yu should.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|After seeing the T.V series and loving it I purchased the box set. However the books were very thick and the print was small. As I now need reading glasses at the ripe old age of 44 I re purchased the books for my Kindle Paperwhite. Now I enjoy them in a light weight, easy to read format. GR Martin is a master story teller and I am enjoying his series very much. I read a little every night before bed. he will keep me entertained for the next few months easily.
0425263924|5.0|I loved this book and the ones before it but I wish it would have not been a cliff hanger!
B0063IH60K|4.0|A fun game that everyone can love. The only problem was when changing the background it sticks and does not respond. However it never stops me from having fun
B0039O8AQK|1.0|I'm trying to think of something good about this movie, but I'm drawing a blank.<br />Perhaps one reason is that the video STOPPED playing... with 20 minutes left remaining!!!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The book thief is a dramatic and compelling novel that is a must read for any high schooler or up.
0345529057|5.0|I'm Trapped in the books right now. I have never read this often! The twists and suspense keeps me locked into the book. And with the TV show to go along with it, this series is a must have.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|i got it a little earlier then the free version and it cost 1.99 dollars and i kind of think its a ripoff cause i come and see that its free and i want my money back so i can get the free now
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|I know its not perfect, but it is a fun game. the guessing at how an balls angle will hit, doesnt always work as it would in the real world...but its still fun to try and get as many targets as you can in one shot.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Me and the grandkids have lots of fun with it.It a good game for a little competition we see who can clear the fast .We love it
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|A great addition to the genera. Don't expect Oscar winning performances...but if you like zombie movies you'll love this one.
B001QMCJ1Y|5.0|This is one of the most heartfelt stories that could be told and it's true.  Just have plenty of Kleenex's handy when watching it. I cried for pure joy.  Wish there were more stories like this instead of the trash that comes out of Hollywood now.
B00377V6J2|5.0|Saw this on PBS and had to have it. Really a great session with two legendary blues greats. Random selection of songs is pleasing. Not the same old songs rehashed. Extended solos really rock.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It's quite cute. Simple enough for younger kids, my niece likes the &quot;lil mini ponies&quot;. Is a little easy to navigate away from, but not difficult to get back. It is amusing for adults to play with the kids.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I love this version of Phantom.  Gerard  Butler was awesome in his part.<br />The music was beautiful and the wardrobe amazing.
B00005U122|5.0|Loved it nearly 3 hours of music. Excellent. Great guitar work by a group of very talented musicians. Would highly recommend.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One thing that history teaches us is that change is most often initiated by the women of the world.  This was a one of the underlying themes of Season 3 and many of the situations were laugh out loud funny.  Highly recommended.
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|I thought they played to many of their new numbers, but they are a very good group. I loved their original record.
B00D3J2QKW|4.0|The word 'focus' can be described in many ways, but I believe that the best description is this: 'Focus on One Course Until Success'<br /><br />Thats very much what this book is about and so much more. I really enjoyed this book, its easy to read, filled with practical examples as well as real life examples that people can relate to.<br /><br />The book is split into 3 parts:<br />1) The Lies - they mislead and derail us (debunking the myths around success)<br />2) The Truth - the simple path to productivity (making the reader understand about the importance of focus)<br />3) Extraordinary results - unlocking the possibilities with you (applying the knowledge gained from the book and giving you the tools to apply it to your life)<br /><br />For me, I love reading and I find that not every book is life changing, but not every book should be because then no book would be. You get different things from different books and each time you read you can see things from a different perspective.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the ONE Thing to read - took me 2 days, about 3 hrs all up
B008AIGWVA|5.0|5 star rating  Great game get it best of all talking Ben is free love science so the chemistry set is a big thumbs up
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Boring<br /><br />The shockers in the narrative are expected and there are way too many moments in the film trying to convince us that Tom Cruise is the hot charismatic leading man he once was. I like Tom Cruise and Tom Cruise movies, but this movie just started to feel embarrassing. Shirtless shower scenes, young woman half his age luring him into swimming pools with cheesy music ques as they whisper sweet nothings to each other. What was the point of this movie again?<br /><br />If you've seen a science fiction movie in the last 25 years, I promise you that you've already seen a better version of this movie.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|The advice given was also relevant to any other type of promotion, be it business or job searching.  Very relevant to today's social media.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Cute little game to keep your mind occupied for times when you are board, takes u a min to get into the game but when u get use to it you will like it, fun fun fun lol
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I WANTED to be able to access the Holy Bible NASB version on my Kindle fire HD on a daily basis.  New American Standard Version is my choice of bible versions.  I would recommend this product to anyone!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A very easy to read book. The examples and stories in it are inspiring and help to underline the practical aspect to the experiments. Most of the experiments turned out well for me. The beans haven't sprouted at all so maybe they are the wrong sort of beans or it's the wrong time of year or maybe it's a bad batch. I think that some things might take a lot longer than 48 or 72 hours to manifest and it might also depend upon fate to some degree. However all in all having done nearly all of the experiments, it has convinced me that there is something to the idea that thoughts are very powerful. And that the law of attraction works. It all makes a lot more sense when you carry out the experiements and get results. Recommended for anyone who is the slightest bit doubtful about the law of attraction. It has convinced me.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|I enjoy this movie because it is a movie that the whole family can enjoy with out any foul language.
B00BDAP66E|3.0|I don't know what this is all about but I guess I will learn as time goes on. Thank you
B008D36INE|3.0|I didn't finish the movie.  It was very depressing.  I wouldn't recommend it even though I like the actors in it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Great!! It took a little time to get used to it but now I love it! I would recommend it to everyone!~!~!!!
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I found this novel to be very slow.  I had to force myself to finish it.  I was at 80% read and was still waiting for something to happen.  I was thinking \\"when is whatever is supposed to happen going to happen?\\".
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It took a little time to get used to it but now I love it! I would recommend it to everyone!~!~!!!
B004WR125O|4.0|Works just like it should.  Better than having to run CAT6 over to the unit.  They should include it with the new receiver.
1594200106|5.0|Zafon weaves a tale that ropes you in from the first sentence to the last.  It is a story of many twists and turns and equally as many characters, all of whom are well rounded and interesting.  Moreover, for all lovers of books and reading, Zafron gives us insight into what connection we have with our books and the important role it plays with our lives.  This book has it all, mystery, intrigue, romance and tragedy and all created by a writer possessed of a rare and inspired talent.  It is guaranteed to send you back to the bookstore for the second and third installments of The Cemetery of Forgotten  Books series.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Sorry to say it, but this was the worst Reacher book I have read. There was no life in the book. Everything was repeated to death. It was almost as if Lee Childs had lost interest in Reacher.<br /><br />I have seen this sudden difference in the books of other authors, for example George RR Martin, and also James Patterson. I do hope this isn't a sign of an author that's out of ideas, or bored. Maybe the book was ghost written.<br /><br />I have always loved the Reacher books. I always loved the style of writing and the detail. But please. There is a limit to detail! This book had detail for detail's sake. Just to buy a shirt we had to get a description of the outside of the shirt shop, a description of the inside of the shirt shop, a description of the seller of the shirt, and a description - of course - of the shirt itself. So there's a pile of pages gone. And so it went. It is way below the standard of the earlier ones.<br /><br />Reacher seems to spend most of the book chasing around in a car, hundreds of miles here then hundreds of miles there. Every little exit is described, the road is constantly described, the speed is constantly described, the dark, the trees, the rain; it goes on and on. The only thing that wasn't clear was the plot, but to be honest by half way I'd lost the will to live.<br /><br />Such a shame.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|The best basic book on money I have ever found. Bought this copy so I had one on the Kindle.
B00E97AZZK|5.0|This movie was just too good, it reminded my of the \\"Oceans\\" moves but with a magic twist! I would definitely recommend this to any one who likes a movie with an unexpected ending!
B00A285OOW|5.0|Another great book, love this history.  Gregory makes it come alive.  You feel as if you are there living it.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|In the tradition of other Star Trek series, it is a wonderful addition to my collection.  I would recommend it.
B008469DGY|5.0|Never thought I'd find a golf game with better physics, let alone a game in general with better physics. But this one definitely takes the cake for the best one!
B002VUFKG6|5.0|At the ten-year mark of my own marriage, this was a fine read for the case to be married and a reminder about why I am married, why I so desired marriage in the first place. It was a celebration, for me, of the union I entered into ten years ago, the joys and trials we've faced so far and what more we have to look forward to from here on out. A great look at marriage throughout history and in other cultures as well.
0547260695|5.0|I got this one for a baby shower. Everyone loves this book. It has amazing details and very well made.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is one of the best games I gave on my Kindle it is so fun and the accessories you can get for your shark are so cute! I am definitely addicted to it :D
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I was hooked from the beginning since it started with a Black American lawyer in jail. Grisham created a tale which included the murder of a Federal Judge, the F B I, prisoners, other lawyers and  judges, and a plot with so many twists and turns that I had to keep reading to see where the next turn would take me.  After trips to Florida, Jamaca, and Antigua, in cars and jets, the light dawned on me -- this was a very different face of the American Judicial system. A cleverly created fictional story of a very different view of law and a very different lawyer!  I would love to see a sequel to this book!
B0081336FO|5.0|This English and modern version is a great version of this age old characters.  One might think we've got enough versions of these stories but these are unique, clever and true to the original theme
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|This is movie that is impossible to hate because it hits hard and close to home for so many high school students in today's society.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|So far it's a pretty decent game to play. I haven't had to spend any money to play it and I actually have friends from my Facebook page. So far so good.
B0058BI896|4.0|Its funny. Its got some great actors and actress in it. I don't see how someone could hate this TV show.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|They just don't make them like this anymore. Hollywood at its very finest. Definitely in my top ten of all time.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|This is a classic. You absolutely can't hate this movie. Its Johnny Depp and Mia Wasikowska. It is impossible to hate this movie.
193700788X|4.0|Was this a great book? No.  Have any of the Sookie Stackhouse books been a literary masterpiece? Definitely not.<br />But all the books were fun to read, and so was this one.  The story had some goofy plot lines but that's par for the course in this series.<br />Maybe I was less disappointed than the average reader b/c I borrowed the book from the library after seeing the awful reviews, but I know I still would have enjoyed reading Dead Ever After even if I'd bought the hardcover and I'm still planning to buy the paper back when it comes out.<br />So read up friends. You know you want to know what happens!<br />p.s. I think Sookie ended up with the only one she should have been with all along.  Eric-schmeric.  :)
B001N4RORE|5.0|Meryl Streep. That's all that needs to be said about this movie. You can't hate this movie at all because of her.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great for a quick and easy way to kill the time. Puzzles are not really easy to do, they are not for children.
B001BR3P0S|4.0|It has a cool plot line, but I don't think that this would happen in detention. Most schools have detention supervised at all times. There is always a teacher in the room, so this would never happen.
B00000ADG2|5.0|You hear this one and you know she basically *was* the Fugees.  Lots of songs coming straight from the heart as well as being incredible tracks.  She's an A-list singer and rapper.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|This is a classic movie and it is Tom Hanks. He in unbelievable in this movie. There is no way to hate this movie.
B0000024K1|5.0|I was in high school when this came out and I listened to it religiously.  I can still listen to this one.  Political consciousness, Chuck D. has my favorite voice in hip hop, social awareness, PE was trying to DO something with their music.  If you've ever wondered who that nut Flava Flav is, here's how he got his start.
B0000CF35G|5.0|I  bought this album for my son and he absolutely loves it. He has the CD as well but plays the vinyl more.
B0000029GA|5.0|Most hip hop I've grown out of, but the beats and lyricism of Illmatic I can listen to intro to end.  If you're building a library, this is a must have.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Confusing at times but otherwise very good reading. Not the ending I was expecting but an even better one. Well done
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It's a lot more interesting than regular Mahjong.  The tiles change and the higher you get the more challenging it gets.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|The movie, Katy Perry: Part of me, helped me to know more what Katy Perry is all about. Very inspirational!
B007FKI9G0|5.0|This ensemble works seamlessly together, even though a lot of it is improv. Love the tunes and the premise. It really hits home if you're a musician.
B00821OX98|5.0|My husband and I both love this show.  We not longer have cable and just started watching it on Amazon
B005MLOKXA|5.0|My husband has been a fan of this series for years,  but  I was put off by the premise of a docile , faithful wife standing by her cheating husband to keep his political career intact.  Since summer is a slow time for good television programming I started watching season one and can't stop!  The main character, Alicia, is a strong talented lawyer, and this show is brilliantly written.  The marital dynamics between her and her husband make for a good sideline story, but the court cases are what keeps me captivated.  If you were a fan of shows like The Practice or LA Law (I realize I am showing my age with these comparisons) then this is the series for you!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I can't even say how many times I've watched it since it came out. It is fantastic. Very excited to see more.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Decent science fiction film. Tom Cruise is *not bad*.  The rest of the cast is pretty good. Plot wise it was interesting.<br /><br />My only gripe is that Nikolaj Coster Waldau aka The Kingslayer wasn't in more scenes.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Good mix of classic A7X and homage to old school metal paying respect to the genre, borrowing sounds from the greats.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Baz Luhrmann is an absolute genius.<br /><br />I saw the movie just hours after finishing the book, and I will say that it is honestly an acceptable replacement for the book. I do not think there was anything that Fitzgerald wanted readers to get out of the book that was not portrayed in the movie. That is not to say that you shouldn't read the book, but if you don't, you will not be missing anything important.<br /><br />The cast was perfect. They simply could not have done any better, and neither could anyone else have. Especially Carrey Mulligan, as Daisy. Her and DiCaprio BOTH deserve TWO Oscars, and possibly a few dozen gourmet cakes, for their performances.<br /><br />Luhrmann's trademark visual decadence was perfect for this story. I honestly don't think that the surrealistic luxury of Gatsby's parties could have been adequately achieved in the past, without the aid of 21st century picture enhancement and special effects capabilities, and I don't think anyone else could use those capabilities as masterfully and tastefully as Luhrmann does.<br /><br />I've heard many negative comments about the modern music, but I think that it was a brilliant decision, and that F Scott Fitzgerald would have agreed with it wholeheartedly. It helped US to connect to the story more. Using music that WE hear at big parties, rather than appealing to us with nostalgia by using 1920's Jazz music.<br /><br />And with that, I will now proceed to buy this perfect movie.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|I am a MINI owner and this edged out &#34;The Borrowers&#34; by a skosh for those of us who like to see Coopers in movies. The whole movie was full of excitement and action. I liked it!
B00B9366VO|4.0|I honestly didn't know what the movie was about.  Being a kid from the 90's, I saw Dave Grohl and I clicked it on.  I have to agree with some other reviews in that I was captivated for the first hour, but after that, I realized that it wasn't about sound city itself but the sound board.  The second part wasn't bad but it could have ended at any moment and you would not have missed anything.  But being a kid from the 90's..............it did have Dave Grohl.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|I'm using this app on my Kindle Fire and it works great. Provides the info I need and is easy to use.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I'm impressed with the work of  Reza, I wish we could have more objective writers like him instead of all this fanatical biased books, loved it. His exposition on historical Jewish Jesus, instead of the overexposed religious Jesus is amazing. I wish you Reza could break down the old testament for us too. That would be great. thanks Reza<br /><br />Mathew 13:57 No one is prophet in their own land&#34;
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Wanted this movie to watch with my kids, because it was one of my favorites growing up. Of course they thought some of the special effects was a little cheesy, but what do expect from kids these days. Overall we all enjoyed it very much.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|If you like puzzles this is the game for you. Really fun to play and a lot of mysteries to solve
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Well written book and very creative in connecting flower names with peoples personalities.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone including book clubs.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have a Roku Box and if it had a YouTube channel, I wouldn't need the Chromecast. I'm sure there will be more versatility with the Chromecast later but for my purposes, I will only use it for viewing YouTube. I only use the TV for viewing movies and hopefully images. For regular computer usage, I prefer the monitor and keyboard process. The rest is hoopla for me and not as efficient.  I can see possibly why there is no YouTube channel on Roku....otherwise, the Chromecast wouldn't be as popular. I say, get a Roku Box and if you really want YouTube, also get the Chromecast. You may need an HDMI Multi input switch box if you don't have enough HDMI inputs on you're TV.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this book, but found I liked it.  It dragged a little in places, but overall I thought it was a good read.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Too much party and not enough story line. Too hard to follow. I dont really recommend it to my friends.
1936608898|5.0|Read this book if you want to be free from your food cravings and addictions, if you want to end the cycle of indulgence followed by guilt and physical crashing, or if you want to understand WHY it happens. Try it! It's only 30 days. (Until you feel so great that it just becomes your new lifestyle!)<br />But most of all, do it so it becomes the norm and me and my friends that do this are no longer the \\"weirdos\\". Because we couldn't go back to eating food-like products nor foods with no brakes...we just feel too good to damage ourselves like that anymore. (And we're lookin mighty fine too.)
B005OCFGTO|5.0|First time watching the rest of the Harry Potter movies. I only seemed to ever watch the first movie over and over BUT I will say, I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the movies as well. I would definitely recommend them to others as well as navigate them to Amazon for a great deal.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Awesome! I'm addicted to the series! I'm currently on the second book and I can't get it read fast enough!
B00821OX98|5.0|Great acting. Great plot. Watched four episodes straight. I may rent other seasons. Highly  recommended. If it was not the scary aliens faces even my kids could watch. It is violent but not gory.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|Interesting look at sound recording from the 70's to early 90's.  Would have liked more music performances, but that would have made the movie too long for viewers.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|The game could be fun if there were instructions.  I found myself just clicking around the screen until something opened.  Played it once and then deleted it.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I sang along...  She is so &#34;real&#34; when she's on stage, and she sounds amazing, even when she thinks she's made a mistake.  You can't help but love Adele, and this setting and crowd are so perfect.  I'm glad they caught it all on DVD for us to enjoy for years and years.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|Cute somewhat fun game. Atleast at first. Gets old quick. This is the most simple button masher there is. Changing outfits is about the only thing you can play for. Free app of the day worth it especially for kids. Would not pay for this game.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|I love the orchestration for thus soundtrack. The horns are wonderfully heavy and rich and it makes me wanna jump in a jager and go fishing. =) Love thus soundtrack. Thumbs up!
014241543X|5.0|This is the first book I have read that Gayle has written. Loved the story and how it was played out.  Great story fell in love with the characters and looking forward to book 2. If you are looking for something to read this series is it.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|love using this app. just be sure to keep power on. It downloaded with ease and has a few features that also allow for you to enjoy the features!!  Great for travel also.
B007AL48UK|4.0|The game is fun however I just noticed that when the message pops up that there are no more moves available and gives the option to rearrange the tiles to complete, the clock is still running. I will give 5 stars if you change this. Otherwise, a wonderful classic with cute summer designs
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I find myself wanting to have lived in Downton Abbey!!  The characters have become my imaginary family.  Cannot wait for new episodes to see what kinds of situations they get themselves into.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Play everyday.....love each room, challenges r a bit annoying but fun....Yes am addicted to this game....slot rooms r a bit complicated on winning but I jus spin for fun....it need more shadow cards...hate naked cards...more htg shadows...that's the negative part about bingo blitz...other wise it fun n u get to meet nice ppl...
B00DU74U74|2.0|A teen love story that was poorly directed.  Pretty boring.  Ronan was the only thing that saved this from being 1 star.
B00C2FFJFM|4.0|Selena Gomez, a rising actress and music artist, has created a fresh name for herself with the help of her new album Stars Dance. These fun and confident tracks hint at Selena's celebrity personality--ringing in two songs about her long-awaited 21st birthday and recent break-up with Pop artist sensation Justin Bieber. Stars Dance could not be more appropriate for Selena's current transition from Disney Channel stardom to her recent participation in Harmony Korine's film, Spring Breakers, which acquired an \\"R\\" rating. Each song tests the A-list star's talent in unique and interesting ways.<br /><br />Selena's beautiful baby-face and down-to-earth persona lured preteens all over the world into purchasing her songs, watching her show and maybe even buying her clothes.(Did I mention she has a clothing line?) Once the artist added sultry music videos complete with slightly revealing clothing and sexy dance moves, she got the preteen and post-teen boys under her sweet spell.<br /><br />Her previous hit, \\"Love Song\\", earned her thousands of plays on radio waves all over the country. The song's creative and magical music video earned even more views on YouTube. However, it was not until \\"Come & Get It\\", her first single from Stars Dance, hit iTunes that she earned a spot at the very top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.<br /><br />The heavy beats and Arabic-inspired melodies in \\"Come & Get It\\" are sure to have you bopping your head once the chorus reaches your ears. The song relates to another genre of music: dubstep. The first few seconds of the song will have you swaying your hips to the sound of (in dubstep terms) the \\"drop.\\"<br /><br />Several of Selena's songs like \\"Slow Down\\" and \\"Nobody Does It Like You\\" also feature this increasingly popular musical mannerism. The artist even coined the term \\"baby dubstep\\" for this occurrence in her music. Furthermore, whether you're listening to \\"Forget Forever\\" or \\"Love Will Remember\\", every single track on this album will be stuckin your head all day.<br /><br />Each song is pleasingly distinctive, subconsciously telling the listener how much work the artist spent into developing Stars Dance. Gomez proves she is not skittish when it comes to trying something new. \\"B.E.A.T.\\", according to Selena, was inspired by fellow musical artist, Dev, and provides a dance-worthy, electronic musicality. \\"Birthday\\" includes a certain repeated noise of a song, often used in hip-hop, similar to a female moaning. Though this is typically found in explicit tracks, this sound is done in almost a classy fashion. Without a doubt, Gomez does well to create appropriate music for her age and fans.<br /><br />Though she has flawlessly performed many difficult musical tasks with Stars Dance, the singer could improve her music with less Auto-Tune. In \\"Nobody Does It Like You\\", this audio processor is used frequently, diminishing Selena's singing credit. Singers should use their real voice in their music.<br /><br />If you enjoy Stars Dance, you might also enjoy music by Dev, The Cataracts, Miley Cyrus, or Britney Spears. All feature similar music paces and Auto-Tuned voices. If you liked the \\"dubstep\\" feel to the music, I would highly suggest listening to Skrillex, Zedd, or Nero.
B00C04H2VO|3.0|I stick the bases on the instrument board in the car and put the toys on the bases. They will drop off as the car move around.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Good game fun to play and easy to play wish u didn't need face book to play needs free play
B005CRY2O6|3.0|I ignored the comments about ingredients being difficult to find because I live in Toronto, a large, very culturally diverse city and have access to numerous and various ethnic grocery stores. I bought the e-version of the book and returned it within a day once I saw some of the ingredients. I think I drew the line at quail eggs. Yes, the book is beautifully done and the recipes are exotic, and no, I would never make any of them because of the ingredients and the work involved.
B0076NAVNA|5.0|What a pleasant surprise and an exquisite collector's item. This disc sensations awakened a lot of rhythm, strength, tenderness and all kinds of colors
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I thought I would love the movie because I love TomCruise and Morgan Freeman.  I found it to be confusing and poorly scripted.
B00BVYLBP2|1.0|I was never able to download the app so I could watch it.  It kept saying something about the http proxy.  When I checked mine, it was just as required (think it was supposed to be off & it was).  Does it not work on IPads?  I'm really interested, but don't know what to do.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It is the best book I have ever read, even better than the movie.I loved this book more that any other book in the world
B0087ITBPC|4.0|It was a good movie to watch if you hda ovr baring jewiis mother. The realtionship of mother and son was great. I enjoyed teh film very much.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|OK, so it isnt likely that someone with no degree and no license to practice law would ever get to be a star in a premiere lawfirm that hires only Harvard grads.  I love that this series, though about lawyers, tries occasionally to be about doing the right thing.  The characters varied and fun.  The women are strong and intelligent and funny and WELL DRESSED!  Gina Torres is an amazing gem.  I have always thought her to be one of the most strikingly beautiful women I've seen and this show sets her off like a platinum setting.  The character of Litt was so obnoxious I could hardly watch when he was involved in a scene, but the character deepens throughout the show and now thanks to Rick Hoffman's great performances, he is one of my favorites.  The show swings the focus from one character group to another so the characters all get a chance to star.  Very very nice, fun entertainment.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The Orphan Master's Son has graphic horrors but also a well structured narrative. It is not chronological because the main character is left in the dark as is the reader as to why things happen and what will happen. It makes for surreal reading but appropriate to the subject matter of a survivor in N. Korea. The ending is particularly effective in its nonlinear progression for the point it is making. At the end we DO care about our hero as he has demonstrated finally the extent of his caring for other people.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Nice game. I like the challenges and the fact that they change scenery every month. I recommend it to anyone
B00BB8Q13A|3.0|The casting is great, the costumes and sets are great, but the plot is iffy, contrived, and hard to believe. I kept watching, hoping it would get better, but it didn't.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Briefly looked at this ap...need to look more in detail but initially thought it was good.  Graphics look good..Generally OK
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Very easy  to  install and set up.This app has numerous settings and having your favorite song awaken you is wonderful.
B002MCYWHG|4.0|Hi all,<br /><br />took me a while to find a carrier that would work with my electric bike... this one easily mounts to the front stem and below the bike seat.  Works great.<br /><br />Ps, my daughter is 4 and it still works for her (although we adjusted the straps a little bit by putting a buckle on the harness).  She is currently in a growing spurt though so I'm not sure how much longer our carefree rides together will last :/  Wish they made one a little bit bigger for the 4-5 group.  Guess its time she gets her own wheels but its been so nice having her close on the bike.
B0016JBCJW|3.0|This movie wad okay - JUST okay. It was mildly amusing in a few places, but not what I would have expected. Actually, I thought it was kind of mean and juvenile in places, I don't think it was a waste of my money to see it, but I won't see it again.
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book was a quick easy read. The program is amazing. I just started my 2nd consecutive 30. I feel great.
1476715904|5.0|Slammed is one of the best teenage/young adult drama series available. It is emotional, thoughtful, and well-written. You will FEEL what the author is writing. The tragedy and the comedy are surprisingly vivid.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn's third novel, Gone Girl, is an exquisitely twisted dissection of marriage, love, the malleability of identity, and the scourge of the media as it seeks to fuel a 24-hour news cycle. Flynn's structure and pacing are nothing short of genius as she parcels out the bits and pieces of the lives of her husband and wife protagonists through alternating first person chapters. Her prose is beyond perfection and magnificently displays the characters' personalities, pulling the reader into their relationship with all its ups and downs. There are turns in this novel that, to reveal here, would be absolutely criminal. Bottom line: Read This Book.
B004N6369Y|3.0|H eloise has had an unusual childhood growing up at the Vendome.  She knows the value of helping others and brings joy to them in her escapades. It is interesting to see all of her accomplishments under the staffs tutelage and formal education and the progress her<br />Relationships.
B004SIP9VA|4.0|If you like dancing and like the actors I think you can enjoy this movie. It does not have much action involved and is a little slow paced though. It is funny.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I love period fiction.  I loved all the characters and how they dealt with changing times.  Their relationships were wonderful.  I would love to live in a community like that.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I love dexter. This season was so good! major plot twist! i definitely recommend it to other buyers! yea. it's awesome
B003Z49LYO|4.0|but sad.  She never seemed to get a break.  It must be where Lemony S. got his inspiration.  The acting and filming was wonderful.  I really loved Tess and my heart broke every time hers did.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Great game. Kills time and is very addicting!! Save the dollars for the more expensive dinos. T. rex is the best..
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I always find myself thinking \\"what if\\"  What if I wasn't depressed? What if I never fell in love with him? Bla bla bla. Thing is, EVERYONE thinks that sometimes. This book really is unbelievable.  It tells the story of few characters and how their personal lives had impact each other's lives without knowing it. Liane, the author did an amazing job of character development, building emotions, and description. I really did not want this book to end. Thing is, it didn't' end because the epilogue answers the \\"what if\\" question leaving readers to imagine the outcome of the characters lives long after completing the novel.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is good clean television.  I love this family and household.  Season 3 was an intense season to watch!!  I highly recommend!!
B007P3TMW2|5.0|A wonderfully crafted story, a real tear jerker, imagine yourself as a 12-year old losing one of your parents (and one upon whom your beliefs are based), excellent acting. I would highly recommend this film to anyone for its insight of one of the saddest days in recent United States of America's history.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|Movie is a great story of people who love and love their music!!!!!  I think that it is a must see!!!!
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|This is a classic.  If you read the book , you know this is it.  They are all amazing.  I love this movie.
B008I34Y6W|4.0|This is one of my favorite line-ups every and this nband kills it live. On Ruth, On Ruth, Thats Ruth
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|I watched about 15 minutes worth.  That's all I could stand.  These are great actors...the acting was soooooo bad, I was embarrassed for them.  The hair and dresses were great, but not enough to make me keep watching.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|I found it intriguing, suspencful and enjoyable. I was always ready for the next chapter.  It is an excellent series.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book is fabulous. I never knew what went on between Tesla and that snake, T. Edison! This could have been a different world if Tesla have bee allowed to go forth with more of his ideas, inventions and discoveries.
B00AW57L96|4.0|I enjoyed the setting. Modern Australia and working out what the secret was, although I didn't guess what it would be.
B00785P2QC|5.0|V good had no problems with this app highly recommend it especially good at passing time also u keep getting money when u are sleeping or when game off
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love this game, I have the original and love this one the same. I would suggest that if you like gun simulators you will love this one.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Nifty writing, good plots, fine acting.  The best part is that the writers seem to &#34;get it&#34; to make each story fascinating yet satisfying.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Like others, I find the constant &quot;rate this game&quot; interruption annoying. Might I suggest that along with the &quot;now/not now/maybe later&quot; adding &quot;Don't ask again&quot; as a choice? That way I have the option (especially after 1 rate.) If it is possible to know the device that bought an app, one would think it would be the same with rating that app.<br />  Now for the rating:<br />I've got quite a few (+) games. Lot of them for g kids. There aren't many I myself play on a regular basis. This one is one of the few I can say I'm addicted to. It's challenging and you have to plan your next move carefully. Finding the gems can take some time. I can't always remember which blocks I've already hit.<br />  Challenges and puzzles tend to be my thing &amp; this is both. I give it 5 *****'s.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|A good solid story line, great characters, and full of intrigue. I look forward to each episode. &#34;Three more words required&#34; : )
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is the best game for kindle fire.But the computer version is better!I would give the computer version 6 stars out of 5!!! LOL
B009AY04A8|3.0|Love hidden object games, but this one has too much dialogue and crappy searches; one minute you're searching based on the name of the item, next game, you're searching based on a silhouette picture of the item.  Like I said, glad it was free.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I found myself liking the first two books better than this one. The ending I think could have been better.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Awesome game just takes patience.....or money to play when you are out of energy. Would love if you didn't have to wait on time to play or use my own money.
147673786X|5.0|McKinsey consultants, in becoming an indispensable part of government and corporate decision making at the highest levels, have helped invent what we think of as American capitalism and spread it to every corner of the world, according to Duff McDonald in this book. At the same time, McKinsey has been implicated in a striking list of failures.<br /><br />The book describes how James McKinsey, an accounting lecturer, wrote an influential book on budgeting for corporations and then started up business in the mid 1920s as James O McKinsey & Company, Accountants and Management Engineers. He soon developed a General Survey Outline as a system for understanding all aspects of a company including finances, organisation and competitive positioning.<br /><br />The firm subsequently grew to a position of great influence with its distinctive values and operational methods. A downturn in the 1970s led to a focus on systematic knowledge building. In the 1990s when Rajat Gupta (subsequently convicted of insider trading) was managing director, the firm focused more on money than on its core values, according to the author, but subsequent managing directors have brought a return to the core values.<br /><br />A very significant percentage of the largest companies and governments in the world use the services of McKinsey and pay very handsomely for the privilege. The question which the book raises is whether the services provided are worth the cost, and the author's answer is a qualified yes. Some companies seem to have received very bad advice, and other companies seem to have been paying fees for too long a period of time, but on the whole McKinsey's clients seem to have benefited.<br /><br />While the book provides interesting perspectives on the history and business of one management consulting firm, it also provides some valuable lessons for anyone involved in the management of other types of professional services firms.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I enjoy the storyline-cheesy humorous but entertaining.  The mini games are better than on other hidden object games. The scenes are beautifully done too. I also like the collections- it gives you opportunity to earn things and take the story forward. There are more choices in this game than others too.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Wonderful clock, looks great, works well each time. Has several cool themes, needs a few more alarm clocks. Just be sure to keep plugged in, or you'll waste the battery.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It ended so sadly but left our whole family wanting so much more. January seems so far away, can't wait.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This was a great story by her. This is the first book of hers that I have read and will read many more.
B006LSZECO|4.0|At times I couldn't stop reading.  I didn't especially like the ending. Still liked the book, thinking of a better ending.
B008469DGY|4.0|Only thing I wish would be added was either different holes for each course or an actual mode to play a round of golf.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|on time and in good  work good  and i will like more  to see like that  think you  very much
B005FISBV2|3.0|I feel this Season 6 was just mailed in. The religious overtones were predictable. But I would still get if you are into Dexter. But the weakest of all 8 Seasons
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Lee Child's book, The Affair, is a good read. As a reader this books makes one hope this kind of thing doesn't really happen.
B003L77GRY|5.0|While Season 1 and Season 4 are excellent, I think Season 5 was really underrated. The group of killers were a great angle.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|British high-brow dramas and usually not my thing . . . but after so many recommendations and hearing so many praises about this show, I gave it a try and lo, and behold, it truly is excellent.  Well acted, intriguing, well written - you get drawn in by these characters and their lifestyles - so unlike ours today.  And Maggie Smith steals nearly every scene she is in.  Well done, Downton!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Love this game! I am always up late playing it;-) My husband gets mad when I'm so tired in the morning from playing this game all night:-/ Totally recommend it!!
0756404746|3.0|Rothfuss wrote a wonderful, imaginative, world but there were two prominent, annoying, problems. First, he tends to over write on tangents that don't add nearly as much to the plot as the time devoted would suggest. It gets to the point that you forget what the plot is. Second, I have never, in my life, read a published book with such a Gary Stu of a protagonist. Kvothe is so perfect that it becomes difficult not to roll your eyes at times. Ever character, every plot point, is there purely to show how fantastic, perfect, and incomparably talented this man is. He has no real flaws. There is not a task he cannot accomplish if he wants it. This is particularly notable when it comes to Kvothe's age. Clearly, Rothfuss wants to make him young just to make his accomplishments all the more fantastic, but he also wants him to be able to experience adult situations. No matter how precocious a child is, he's still a child, and Rothfuss writes him like a fully mature adult. He doesn't think, act or sound like a teenage boy.<br /><br />All this said, the story is good. Sometimes, I had to just stop because the perfection of Kvothe was too much, but I always came back. I will finish the trilogy, because Rothfuss is a good story teller, but he needs a long lesson in characterization. He would do well to check out George R. R. Martin's books as a truly spectacular example of how to write well rounded, imperfect, characters.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I loved everything about Quartet.  The acting was superb, of course.  I loved the  idea of a home for retired opera singers and musicians.  The aging process spares no one!  It was delightful to see the drama of old rivalries, loves,  and, friendships,

B008478VE8|2.0|The first 50 pages or so of the Ray Comfort version were printed on toilet paper. Just avoid it and you should be fine. Shame on Amazon for peddling that junk even if it is free.
B005544TRQ|4.0|We randomly came across this show and right away, loved the sarcasm and characters.  My only complaint is that the show is kind of redundant. Each episode has a similar story line.  My husband is still hooked though, so I'm sure we'll continue to watch the remaining seasons.
B0092S4WLY|2.0|THIS GAME IS NOT A GAME.....THERE ARE NO &#34;HINTS&#34;<br />YOU JUST PUNCH AND PUNCH AND HOPE FOR THE  BEST!<br />VER Y.......VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!!!  NOT FOR ME!!!!<br />I THINK........ITS'S FOR  PEOPLE THAT KNOW SCIENCE!!!

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Hi I'm a 12 year old girl . I really enjoyed this book it was fun and a good family book. To all you parents out there take my advice this is not a night time book. Have fun reading this book to kids or kids themselves.<br />From the  the 12 year old reader
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book was really good except the ending was, eh. The build up was great but the ending was just slammed together in the epilogue.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|Another great hidden object game by this company, I have all 6 hidden objects games.  I await anxiously each month for their new one. It is one of the best games out there and believe me I have tried a lot of them. Keep them coming please. Play them over and over and never get bored.
0553328255|5.0|There you have it. The Complete Sherlock Holmes at a reasonable price. A classic for a good read :) 5 STARS!
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|This book does a great job telling an entertaining fictional story that has a lot of very real IT problems and situations in it.  The story weaves in a lot concepts and ideas from other popular books on IT, lean, process improvement, etc.  I only wish the book did a better job tying all of the concepts together to conclude the story.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is the best one volume treatment of the subject that i've read.  In describing many other religious and social figures who were active during Jesus' time, it puts Jesus' life and message in the historical context in which it belongs.  The book is by no means a religious tract.  It will appeal to those interested in the historical enviornment in which Jesus operated.
B001JI72AI|5.0|It was great to watch this movie again with my kids. Now they are old enough to appreciate it. They also got a kick out of the comment on &#34;a computer being able to fit in a single room&#34; :)

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Had recorded it on DVR, and have watched it countless times. Wanted DVD for my permanent library. Whole cast exceptional.
B00274EYKY|5.0|Rarely does an actor actually BECOME the role they are playing, but in The Wrestler, Mickey Rourke completely OWNS this character!!! One of the best films ever with Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood also delivering knockout performances! If you haven't yet seen this movie, do yourself a favor and get it immediately. You will not be disappointed.
B00007L4OM|5.0|Have been a Jean Reno fan since The Professional. This one is such a delightful, improbable story, and i watch it whenever I need a good laugh.
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|Wall-E is a timeless movie that really resonates with young children and adults. There are messages for everyone to take away and to learn from. I would highly recommend this movie for a family movie night.
B000FBJHT4|1.0|This guy sucks you in with the intro and the first chapter, and then it becomes wooo-wooo!  Total idiocy.  Don't let yourself be fooled into wasting money on this illiterate and dumb book.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and I have thoroughly enjoyed watching it on my Kindle Fire Tablet.  I had to be at the hospital visiting a patient daily and it was wonderful to be able to watch this series while I was there.  Excited for the next season and sad about how the 3rd season ended.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Without a doubt the greatest SciFi flick ever made.  Great acting, great directing, great art!<br />There are few movies which I want to see again.<br />So I bought this one.<br />And I watched it again.<br />And again.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Was a good movie if you go into it understanding its classic action flick. I enjoyed the first Dredd just as much.
0887431453|5.0|My 4 year old son enjoyed working in his workbook every day several times a day. Many activities to keep him busy. He has learned so much in a short amount of time using this workbook. He is way ahead of the game. I would definitely recommend this workbook.
B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|Excellent album. From start to finish. I love Trent's voice. Can't wait to see him in concert again. To the newer generation , this is how it's done.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Very good/vivid landscape shots. Good story line with a happy (and weird) ending. It is worth watching if you like futuristic, sci-fi movies.
B00991TCOG|5.0|ive watched her utube vids and I just had to buy a CD. her music is AWSOME! 5 stars.... id give 10 stars if I could!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it and being able to play with family and friends.  Great new levels too. Lots of fun all the time
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Hard to find a show on TV with any intelligence behind it anymore.  This one is enjoyable. The two main characters work well off each other.  I hope it continues to be successful.  Hard to find this if you miss an episode.  Great for Amazon to have it online.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I learned so much. I am so reassured. Written by a caring and compassionate expert on a subject often avoided
B00008BXJJ|5.0|Came in excellent condition and unwrapped.. Great buy i enjoy the live versions of the songs and like that it had all the songs that i like
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is challenging yet relaxing. The music is soothing, but it would be nice to be able to change the music to other relaxing songs. Good game.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|It was an okay game but obviously designed to make you spend real money to get anywhere. I decided to uninstall it but then everytime I would go online it would start to redownload itself without asking. Okay so look developers, what I was trying to tell you by deleting this game is that I DO NOT WANT IT ON MY KINDLE anymore, sorry if that wasn't clear. Also I only have so much data I can use every month and you're wasting it with this BS.

B004GJYR7I|4.0|Still simply, outrageous and funny.  Two of the finest of American actors forever forged their futures playing far from character.  Katherine Hepburn and Archibald &#34;Cary Grant&#34; Leach remain forever remarkable.  This is a truly odd and funny view of a silly situation that brings nothing but laughter to its viewers - It will continue for decades to come.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|This a very fun game, and they add new stuff still the time. I don't like the changes they made with this last upgrade, especially the way they doubled the price of power-ups.

B0098G7AWS|5.0|Titanic's biggest flaw is that it is too big. Too big, too popular, too famous, and too profitable. The hype, the hate, and the endless parodies have made us lose sight of what was, at that time, the greatest motion picture spectacle on earth.<br />Flaws aside (and there are plenty), Titanic remains one of the most affecting blockbusters of all time. A touching love story merges almost seamlessly with awe-inspiring spectacle and heartrending action. The human drama of Spielberg merges with [[ASIN:B0037NVM2C James Cameron]]'s own unsurpassed action and suspense (Aliens? Most action-packed movie of all time.) to create a half oldschool, half newschool epic.<br /><br />This is one of those movies, like Shakespeare in Love, that get's a lot of bad hype BECAUSE it was hyped to the moon. Come back, I urge you, with an open mind, and you will find that the CGI is still amazing, the climax is still heartrendingly horrific, and Jack and Rose's (arguably the most famous duo in movie history) starcrossed romance is still affecting, and -- oh, is that a tear in my eye? Of course not, because real men don't cry in Titanic. It is scientifically proven that women are 97.77% more likely to cry during Titanic. And you can quote me on that.<br /><br />Castwise, [[ASIN:B000OLRH10 Leo DiCaprio]] bears the brunt of the criticism, because, let's face it: he's a little annoying, and it would still be a couple years before DiCaprio matured into the brilliant star of Blood Diamond and The Departed. [[ASIN:B001VEE5KK Kate Winslet]] fares better as Rose (it's impossible not to feel sympathetic towards her when she's swimming around with an axe in subzero waters), but it is the supporting cast -- Billy Zane, Kathy Baker, Bill Paxton, and Bernard Hill in a stunning performance as Captain Edward Smith -- that really impress.<br /><br />Admittedly, the first half of the film is thin. Something about a submarine, and a bit of social drama, some love story and suspense thrown in for good measure (Because we all know how the story will end, right?)...I guess this is the &#34;melodrama&#34; part of Titanic, and this is done oldschool style. Still, a leetle slow. But's when we reach night time on the 4th day of HMS Titanic's maiden voyage, that TITANIC transforms from a sentimental sweet social drama/romance to an absolutely brutal and heartrending spectacle of horrific action. The sinking scene will still put you on edge and send shivers up your spine. The unthinkable tragedy of the event combined with the human element makes one of the most poignant climaxes in blockbuster history. The CGI supplements the sets and amazing acting, and, if you don't feel even an invisible tear in that horrific scene where everybody drowns in their rooms...then, well, you don't have a heart.<br /><br />The story is _absolutely_ predictable, and Titanic almost flaunts this. Cameron uses every trope and trick in the business to wring emotion from us, ranging from the sentimental, to the sweet, to the cliche&eacute;d. But unlike any other film of the sinking of HMS Titanic, TITANIC is the only one to mix social commentary and emotion, as well the world's greatest, most terrifying sinking ship scene ever filmed. The result? We feel terribly sorry for the people on that boat.<br /><br />CONS: Corny, predictable, hasn't 100% stood the test of time, &#34;I'm king of the world!&#34; is worst line EVER, ending is somewhat sentimental.<br />PROS: Spectacle, romance, great acting, something for men AND women, action, drama, melodrama, scope...what MORE could you ask for in a blockbuster?<br /><br />In conclusion, Titanic has not fully stood the test of time, and many of us are forgetting how damn impressive it actually was back in 1997. This is a huge crowd-pleaser, as evinced by it's 2 billion dollar payoff, as well as a critic pleaser, as shown by it's impossible 11 Oscars! Overrated? Yes. A hugely affecting blockbuster of heart and drama, touching and melodramatic, yet terrifying and gutwrenching and brimming with impressive spectacle? Yes, yes, and yes.<br /><br />Titanic is truly a TITAN of a film. 4.5 stars.ing and brimming with impressive spectacle? Yes, yes, and yes.<br /><br />Titanic is truly a TITAN of a film. 4.5 stars.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|It is a great show. Action packed and brotherly love. It relates to events that is stated in the bible.
B007CLSE8K|2.0|Before watching The Three Musketeers, I asked myself how it could be rated so bad. Sure, critics are never partial to these sorts of movies, but I had hopes that it would be an action-packed, fun, crowd-pleasing adventure with some good acting. After all the cast was amazing. Excluding Logan Lerman, who has all the skill and acting range of a small pebble, the cast had the excellent Matthew Macfayden, the icy-cool Luke Evans, the electrifying Mads Mikkelsen (coolest European actor ever!), the peerless Christoph Waltz, and the flamboyant Orlando Bloom. You couldn't go wrong with that A-list. Or so I told myself, because, evidently, you COULD.<br /><br />So I give you My Reasons Why The Three Musketeers (2011) Sucks:<br /><br />1. The Cast: What -- it's greatest advantage is also it's greatest downfall? Pretty much. Let's start with Logan Lerman, in the most miscast role of all time since Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader. Lerman can't act. Sometimes he chooses roles that fit him better (Percy Jackson), but his roles so far are mediocre at best, and this is a phenomenally bad role (I have hope for him, though, in the future). Nobody attempts even the faintest shadow of an accent, French or British, speaking instead in whatever accent they deem easiest. Matthew Macfayden is a phenomenal actor, but he comes off here as just silly, and Ray Stevenson is turned into a stupidly strong fighting machine. Luke Evans is the ONE good thing about this movie, I swear, as he manages to keep his dignity about him AND be cool at the same time. Bloom and Waltz chew up the scenery with their OTT roles, but neither actor is showing off their true range. Mikkelsen is usually the coolest actor onscreen, but is reduced here to a mere caricature. Milla Jovovich becomes a juvenile sex symbol, and Juno Temple is miscast. I could go on and on...<br /><br />2. The screenplay is ABSOLUTELY atrocious: The dialogue is abysmally bad, filled with uber cheesy oneliners and modern slang that sounds absolutely foreign in the mouths of such fine actors (you actually begin to feel sorry for Macfayden). You can have Daniel Day-Lewis and Bobby de Niro in your movies, but if you give them bad lines....they will still sound bad.<br /><br />3. The CGI: this is some of the worst CGI I have ever seen in a mainstream blockbuster. It is painfully obvious and terribly out of place. Be prepared to grimace, groan, and be shocked at just...really poor computer generated imagery. The slo-mo, the airships, the cityscapes...it's all really bad.<br /><br />4. All that steampunk nonsense. Airships, wires that act like lasers, hidden crypts, modern technology, and all that stupid stuff about Da Vinci designing all these fantastical machines....oh, and one more: AIRSHIPS. In the early 1800's. Because that's so stupid we need to say it again.<br /><br />5. Distance yourself in EVERY way possible from the original book. Take the most beloved work of French literature ever (aside from Les Miserables), with peerless action, humour, and characters. Then tear that down piece by piece, substitute with your own terrible plot, and garnish with slapstick. Enjoy.<br /><br />6. Shoot for mediocrity. To this day, there has still never been a film adaptation of Dumas's Three Musketeers that has fully satisified me. The finest one to date is the Michael York 1973 version, starring Oliver Reed, Charlton Heston, Faye Dunaway, and Michael York as D'Artagnan. The 1993 version with Chris O'Donnel, Kiefer Sutherland, and Tim Curry is silly but loads of guilty fun. The Three Musketeers (2011) has no wish to set itself above or apart any from the previous film versions. That's why it sucks.<br /><br />PROS: Luke Evans?...uhh, costumes?....uhh...<br /><br />What more can I say? This is a pretty bad movie, not even worth watching to entertain you for 1 and a half hours. Watch one of the older versions, read the awesome book, but stay away, because this is not worth watching. 2 rapiers out of 5.solutely foreign in the mouths of such fine actors (you actually begin to feel sorry for Macfayden).

B009EHDU7U|5.0|The story which should have seemed ridiculous became reality. The absurdity of the characters somehow became real.<br />You just needed to keep reading and reading to find how it would all end.

B0081336FO|5.0|This is much better compared to the US version of Elementary.  Both in modern times, but Sherlock allows you to be in his mind, and go on a rendezvous of a mysterious life and times of the great detective.  I couldn't stop until I finish the whole season!

B000P0J0A6|3.0|I absolutely loved this movie when it came out! I even got gizmo for myself!! The movie was christmastime and I was a kid who loved the magic of Christmas. The movie was magical,whimsical my own fantasy world. The transformed gremlins horrified me and but I did get the adult ways they were acting.. Partying getting into mayhem ! I found it funny. I didn't see it as dark comedy just the way the movie was! As an adult the magic was gone! It wasn't creepy ,funny whimsical,stripe was obviously the leader they said it enough plus he was the only one with hair! Duh! I forgot the main characters were adults! Very young adults but still adults. I must have paused the movie 7 times and even walk out to the store during it! I didn't hear the sad story that kate  told( a lot of stuff was going on that even the characters seemed annoyed like get on with it)when I was young! How could anyone not like Christmas? Now as an adult I have plenty of reasons why Christmas is a time I dread! Obviously the movie was well written the stars were perfect and the town adorable but that's it! Please don't think I hate the picture I may try to see it again with a child to see the magic in their eyes! And we will watch it around Christmas! I may feel a bit different!! I almost always give movies a second try!!! Enjoy! Especially if its your first time or you are a child of any age!!!!

B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I really love this app, but I have a some complaints. One not having more layers, I have a Kindle Fire HD 7in and it maxes out on 4 layers it would be nice to have a unlimited amount. My second complaint is that every now a then the app will shut down on its own, it seems to happen more when I import a picture and play with it on the app. My final complaint would have to be not having some type of manual, for those who are new at the app, something with more detail of what everything is and what they do and maybe some ideas on different ways to use them.<br /><br />If you can please do a update that would be great.<br /><br />Thanks.

0316228583|3.0|I gave up on this book twice before starting over and finally finishing it. In the first 300 pages or thereabouts, the characters seemed to me to be unrelievedly and unrealistically bleak, as though the author herself was mistaking poverty and meanness for authenticity, like her adolescent character Fats Wall. The omniscient framework that let the reader into every character's head showed only the worst of each person: fear, pettiness, and selfishness, with the only pleasures coming from sticking a pin in someone else. The offscreen Barry Fairbrother was apparently the only decent person in town, although even he was a bit of a jerk in the first couple of pages before he died and created the casual vacancy.<br /><br />To my surprise, somewhere in the last 200 pages I found myself drawn in to the plot, caring about some of the characters, and interested in how the others ended up. It was as if over the course of the novel I first got to know each character only down to the shallow depth that a cynical teenager might see in an adult (phony surface with vanity and ignorance underneath), but ultimately I got to know them as actual human beings I could understand and even cry over.<br /><br />I have a feeling that if I reread the first 300 pages I would see the comic side, knowing the characters as I do now. Maybe I'll do that someday but for now I feel I've spent enough time with the residents of Pagford.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time.  It kept my interest and made me want to stay up late to find out what happens next and figure out how all of the stories weave together.  Be assured, that in the end you are still guessing! Love this!
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Nicholas Parks has done it again.  Great story with mystery , love , danger and the beautiful town of Southport, NC.<br />Julianne Hough is just right for this part and she did a great job.  The supporting cast was just the right mix of interesting characters.<br />I would like to see it again to see all the twists and turns that pull you in and keep your attention.<br />We were so impressed with Southport, we are going there this year for a short stay.<br />This is a wonderful Saturday night, relaxing at home movie to watch with your love one.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|They really have no reason to move around. There is no tension. There is little impelling the story to go to the next scene. AND the whole thing is pretty racist. Avon Barksdale (The Wire fans will know) is just dragged around like meat. No lines? Why it he there except to embody the criminal element as a black dude. Lame movie. Worse than even the original which was B-movie bad.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Heart breaking and uplifting.  A great roller coaster with an outstanding message.  Script, plot, depth and fair acting kept us glued to the screen and left us cheering.
B003ZA0BCY|5.0|This movie never gets any recognition. It is absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. Brenden Frasier is hilarious!! Also check out Bedazzled. That one might be funnier!
B009NY43NY|3.0|Sookie Stackhouse has an interesting life.  She possessed probably the last cluviel dor.  A Fae construction with the power to grant its holder any wish.  She used it to bring a friend, Sam, back from the dead.  Her vampire husband Eric would have liked her to use it to get him out of a spot of trouble.  Now Sam is avoiding her.  Her vampire husband is dumping her to marry a vampire queen, and she has been charged with murder.  Sookie will soon learn just how many friends she really has.  It will be harder to learn who her enemies are.  Bullets, blood, and death will be involved.  I found the novel a quick read and a fitting ending to the series.
B008602KQI|4.0|Movies rarely live up to the books that they derive from, but this one leaves little out. I thought they did an excellent job of conveying the horror of the situation and look forward to the new movie coming out soon.
1892005034|5.0|This is the basic text of nvc and is the place to start in exploring this life-changing practice. I recommend What We Say Matters as a companion book which illustrates how useful nvc can be in daily life.
1451613512|4.0|Not an easy read but flows well.  This is not a book for those who only want the good news about  our country but when you lay the misadventures in our distant and recent past the conclusions are sound.  It is unfortunate the US is not always the shining castle on the hill.  The same approach would come to the same conclusion about any major power, warts and all.  Tells  it like it. Oliver Stone has a reputation for doing that and his coauthor is a sound historian.  Sometimes the truth hurts just
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The plot was just silly. The story took too long to develop and when the &#34;ahhh ha&#34; moment is finally revealed, it is a big disappointment.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Funniest movie I've seen in a long time... hilarious movie for young adults great funny story line i recommend it
B00EV4EUT8|5.0|In this day and age when civil rights (equal rights) are still being battled in the courtrooms (even 237 years later after the Bill of Rights and Constitution was signed) with issues like Gay Marriage and Women's Rights (which are still forcing people to fight for their own personal freedoms and choices because of archaic minded judges, courtrooms, bible beaters or just plain ignorant and intolerant people who think they are better then anyone else), this movie, \\"The Butler\\" shines through a dark page in America's long history to remind all of us that our justice system is very slow to operate, even more slower to learn and - to this day, does not still embrace equal or civil rights of all Americans equally.<br /><br />Director Lee Daniel's (Precious, The Paperboy) did three amazing things; One, he used writer/actor Danny Strong's (The Hunger Games: Mockingjay  1 & 2) masterful screenplay adaption of an original news article of \\"A Butler Well Served by This Election\\" written by Wil Haygood.  Two, he assembled the most brilliant, talented, enlightened and heartwarming cast of `Hollywood Gold' he could find. And three, directed the film, cast, crew and story with such subtly of warmth, compassion and bitter reality of what was the highs and lows of the Negro segregation issues were and then became over a 70 year time period from the streets of America to the inside view from the White House itself.<br /><br />I'm only going to highlight the most stunning performances of this over 30 membered star-studded cast, although there wasn't a single bad performance by anyone in this film. Forest Whitacker (Platoon, The Last King of Scotland) plays the leading role Cecil Gaines, as the butler who served in the White House for over 60 years. His passion and dilemmas with the oppression of the Negro race has seen many supporters and non-supporters both in the nation's streets and in office as our presidents. Some were sympathetic to him like James Marsden (X-Men, Hairspray) playing John F. Kenny and other were not as accepting like Alan Rickman (Harry Potter, Die Hard) playing Ronald Reagan.<br /><br />Oprah Winfrey (The Color Purple) choses her roles based on the quality of the character and she hit a `gold mine' with Gloria Gaines, Cecil's wife and mother of two very different children heading in two very different directions in a time when a nation did not respect their own citizens based on the color of their skins. Oprah's passion for her two children, Earl Gaines played brilliantly by David Banner (The Ropes, street Kings) and Charlie Gaines played so sympathetically by Elijah Kelly (Hairspray, Dirty Sexy Money) was so compassionate you completely understand this mothers concerns and fears and her eventually downfall with alcohol. Yet, her love overcomes all.<br /><br />Cuba Gooding, Jr. (Jerry McGuire, As Good As It Gets) plays a new best friend to Forest in the White House and does a heartfelt amazing realization of what Cecil has to deal with at home and in the Oval Office.<br /><br />The presidents were amazingly portrayed by Robin Williams (Good Morning Vietnam, Good Will Hunting) as Dwight D. Eisenhower, John Cusak (2012, Being John Malkovich) as Richard M. Nixon, Liev Schrieber as Lyndon B. Johnson and other White House icons like Minka Kelly (500 Days Of Summer, Just Go With It) as Jacqueline Kenny, Nelson Ellis (True Blood, The Inside)as Martin Luther King, Vanessa Redgrave (Howard's end, Mission: Impossile)as slave owner Annabeth Westfall, Mariah Carey (Precious) as family friend Hattie Pearl and Jane Fonda (The China Syndrome, On Golden Pond) as Nancy Reagan. They all looked, acted and even sounded exactly like what you would expect them to. It was amazing.<br /><br />This film should not only be nominated, but as far as all the films out there so far this year, it should win all the awards in all the categories it could possibly  be nominated for/in; Including Cinematography by Andrew Dunn (Hitch, Crazy Stupid Love), Costume Design by Ruth E. Carter (Serenity, Malcolm X), musical score by Rodrigo Leao (Ecuador) and the entire make-up department for the film for the wonderful transformations of some of our favorite actors into real historical figures of the past.<br /><br />Take the entire family for a strong, emotionally riveting historical journey through American history of the Negro (Afro American) struggle to attain their supposedly \\"God-Given rights\\" as citizens of this nation. You will laugh, you will be angered, you will be disgusted, you will be shocked, you will be ashamed and you will cry - both happy tears and sad tears.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I have tried dieting several times over the past 20 years.  Some diets are successful (e.g., Atkins, Weight Watchers) but unsustainable for me. Wheat Belly not only prescribes a workable diet, it also provides an easy-to-understand rationale for the diet.  Most importantly, it works!  I've lost ten ponds in six weeks without suffering: no hunger pangs because I am not eating foods that cause an insulin spike.<br /><br />The true test will be one year from now: did I lose all the weight I wanted to shed and was I able to keep it off?  I think the answer will be positive since cutting out wheat-based products has not been terribly difficult to understand or to implement.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|The feel is fine and I like the layout, which is more like the Xbox, but it doesn't seem to work wirelessly and that's a big selling point.  So I have to drag a wire across the living room to get it to work at all.<br /><br />Bummer
B004EF65QA|5.0|Loved it. North and South was a book club selection but I got to see the film in advance of reading the book.  I still have the book and plan to read it, but I enjoyed the story on film so much.  Perfect rendering of the time, with good actors in each part.

B00BEIYMTW|2.0|Always having been a fan of Disney animated films since I was a child, most of the modern films have set a standard in comedy, characters and above all, story. Even the musicals and the music `within' type films are usually charming, entertaining and often enduring in a way. \\"Planes\\" takes a more than slight turn in the opposite direction.<br /><br />The film took a long time to get the characters interesting enough for me to care about them. The story of the underdog and his triumph, not anything new, became extremely predictable in this film. It wasn't until about ¾'s the way I felt slight emotion for the underdog and his friends and the real adventure began.<br /><br />Directed by Klay Hall (Tinkerbell and the Lost Treasure) and written by Jeffrey M Howard (Tinkerbell, Pixie Hollow Games) from a story from the original genius that made Pixar famous, John Lasseter (Toy Story, Wall*E), \\"PLANES opens in a nose dive of a really long drawn out exposition of the underdog Dusty Crophopper voiced by Dane Cook (Mr. Brokks, Dan In Real Life).<br /><br />Some of the talent includes, the mentor of the film is voiced by Stacey Keach (American History X, The Bourne Legacy) as Skipper. Brad Garrett (Everyone Loves Raymond, Finding Nemo) voices Chug, the longtime companion of Dusty. Teri Hatcher (Lois & Clark, Desperate Housewives) voices Dottie who eventually becomes the love interest in a very unusual twist. Julia Louis-Dreyfus (A Bug's Life, Seinfeld) plays Rochelle and actual female baddie - who turns her heart by the end.<br /><br />By the way, this is supposed to be an almost crossover world as seen in the Cars movies, but it doesn't have the charm and power of keeping you attention in the beginning. I will admit, the last 20 minutes was touch and heartwarming - but again, it took over an hour to get to that point. Kids were wrestles in the theatre and the adults were walking out - too bad too - the best things were at the end of the film.<br /><br />Young, young kids should love the color and landscapes, but unfortunately older kids and adult won't find anything interesting until the film is almost over. To me this is a DVD/Blu-Ray rental type of film. I can only think that Disney is not thoroughly reading the scripts these days, the quality of story and character is dropping. I wonder what would Walt say about this!uld love the color and landscapes, but unfortunately older kids and adult won't find anything interesting until the film is almost over.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love the idea of being able to go to Facebook no matter where I am. Recommend to anyone wanting to check out Facebook.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Well done, plenty of great CGI, excellent plot twist to set up the ending.  Worth renting for an evening or weekend.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not my favorite book but fast paced and an okay summer read. Not sure what all the hullabaloo was for. Just an average book
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We have enjoyed watching the going-ons at Downton Abbey very much, and wonder where we will find the patience to wait until January 2014 for Season 4! Excellent story line and excellent actors.
0547884591|4.0|My friends told me I was stupid buying a cook book....<br />But, they quickly changed their tune !<br />Awesome book!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show was much more interesting and easy to follow than I originally expected.  It was sad, funny, intriguing all wrapped into one show.  Definitely a must watch!
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game is great. Helps pass the time and also has great puzzles to work with.Keeps you entertained. Try it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The dialogue is entertaining and sophisticated, the humor keeps it light, while the subject matter can be serious. This isn't your run-of-the-mill legal series.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|A thoroughly delightful British comedy with an enjoyable ending. Dustin Hoffman has done well in directing this little gem. Maggie Smith provides an insightful performance of one moved bv age beyond prime years. Well worth watching.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|This product was a discounted key.  I believe the normal price is like $10-15.  I was very happy with the results.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game my son loves it! Fun for children .<br />Fun free &amp; easy! My child loves horses so this is very entertaining to him-
B008LSVLVA|5.0|I must for Porcupine Tree fans. If u like this, check out Steve Hackett of original Genesis He has great live album
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you liked the movies you will like this game. From a Vector battle ,to selling cokies against Mina,to facing the big and mighty El Machio, it is truly addicting
B002APU580|5.0|This is my favorite version of this movie. Nothing can compete with the book, but this is really enjoyable and has great casting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book melted my Ipad, lol.  It's a good series.  Read it for yourself.  Do not go by what others or the media says.  Read it for yourself.  I hope the movie is just as good.  Hope it's not watered down too much.
B004SDEP38|5.0|This product was is exactly as it is described.  It performs fine and doesn't require any special knowledge.  Great deal.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I downloaded this app for free because it was the free app of the day! And it is sooooooo fun didn't cost me anything but I would buy it if it was not free! Keeps you entertained for HOURS!
B009X01ELC|5.0|I love the rotation of this case. I put in the portrait (vertical) position when I am eating and reading a book. It is like having a book on a book stand but a little better because it does not take up as much space as an actual book.<br /><br />Then it can rotate to the landscape (horizontal) position to do things that require that position. Then I can leave setting on the table while I am doing something else at the same time.<br /><br />Then it will rotate to let you charge it and keep the cover closed (I use this position the least of them all).<br /><br />It also has a elastic and case material strap for holding onto the case while carrying it around.<br /><br />The Kindle is very secure because it snaps into a holder.  It has an elastic strap that keeps the case open or closed.<br /><br />I also like the auto turn on when the case is opened.<br /><br />I would recommend this case to anyone. But especially, to those that would like to set their Kindle on a flat surface and use the portrait position.<br /><br />I have really enjoy this case.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I think it is great because you recieve quickly,i stay in touch with friends as far as Tennessee ,and it is easy to read the messages,the font is regular
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this version of AB.  It's super-fun to release the captive birds.  The squealing monkeys are even more maddening than smirking pigs!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow,it's hard to believe that sequel could be as good as or better than the first novel.  Sylvia Day has done it again!
B009AMANBA|2.0|Movie  was  good.  Great  Historical  Event in  visual form:  I  learned  something  from  actually  'seeing'  it,  not  just  reading  a history book.
B00B7ERH04|2.0|Am I the only one who thinks it's queer that the camera is upside down? Not my kind of camera definitely my last choice!
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Buddy Guy is one of my favorite performers.  This pair of CD's did not disappoint.  Still got it after all these years!
B00APKIN1I|5.0|This was a fun cd with many different artists.  Dave Grohl is on top of his game.  I love the cut with Stevie Nicks.  Good CD with a different feel from just a single artist recording.
B009JZWO3I|3.0|The character's are very one dimensional. Not a whole lot of surprises.<br />I am upset that the 4th season must be paid to watch.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|My 13 year old son was thrilled. We made in read all the books before he saw the movies, and he was grateful we did! He really enjoyed all the movies, noticed a few slight differences to the books, but overall enjoyed it more having read all the books first.
B008220C38|5.0|This is my  second  version  I own:  Love  Keira  in  this  movie.  So  had  to  get the  movie  even though I'm  so  familiar  with  this  story ... of  course  I read the  book  also!
B0019IIPXQ|4.0|Pitch Black introduces you to Riddick in a scary action packed science fiction story where the characters are on another planet. Riddick is definitely a bad guy, but he is also the hero and much about him is a mystery. The aliens are vicious and scary! I've seen it before and I still like it after watching it again.
B003DWC6IQ|5.0|This book is next best thing to the Count of Monte Cristo - I loved it. It is a book I will go back to again and again.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|I think Cory Taylor has one of the best voices out there right now.  These cd's, House of Bones parts 1 & 2,  did not disappoint.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this is such a fun app to completely butcher peoples hair! I especially like making lookalikes of characters! even though I'm almost fifteen, I freaking love this!
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|Vince Gill and Paul Franklin do a wonderful job on this tribute album to Haggard and Owens. I love it.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|Another epic that had to be added to the movie collection. Great story, great visuals. Case, dvd, packaging all arrived in great shape.
B000F8O35U|5.0|It was a gift for a child that was well received.  Animated musical with limited scary images makes children and parents happy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should get this app because there is a lot of land to build and destroying creeper and zombies is so much fun.  I wish they will lower the price but BUY THIS APP!!!!!
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Once again these CD's, House of Gold and Bones Parts 1 and 2, did not disappoint.  I like anything Corey Taylor does.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good story.  Entertaining.  I had to get past Tom Cruise as I think he always gives good effort but almost all his characters seem on the flat side of 3 dimensional.  But overall, good flick.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Took a little while to figure out what to do since there are no instructions. Once I got going it was pretty easy to find the clues and \\"escape\\". Ten levels were not enough.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Awful movie...just awful. Awful script, miscast actors...everything about it was wrong. The book itself wasn't great but it least it was enjoyable.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great show.  It's addicting.  Can't stop watching The Good Wife.  I highly recommend watching; this coming from a person who doesn't watch a lot of television.  Can't wait for season 5.
B0035LGXXO|5.0|Over the years I have encountered people from all walks of life & all sides of the track who have mentioned or referenced this movie in a conversation. When I would tell them, \\"I've never seen it.\\" I was immediately met with disbelief and an immediate instruction, \\"Oh GOD! You have got to see it! It's one of my favorite movies of all time.\\" Naturally I was very curious to find out what I'd been missing all these years.<br />I began watching and was sucked into a story about the biggest, baddest gangsta in NY \\"Cyrus\\" calling a meeting of ALL the gangs of NYC together. But instead of the intended uniting off everybody, the meeting disolves into chaos when someone in the crowd shoots & kills Cyrus in mid speech. The actual shooter points the finger at another gang, The Warriors, in an effort to shift blame off of himself and everybody believes him. So their is a bounty announced on the warriors' heads & every single gang in NYC is out to find and hurt them dead or alive. The movie details the fraut adventure The Warriors must face to make it back to their turf in Coney Island-while obviously having to passing thru all the other gang's territory. Can You Dig It?!<br />The clothing and gang names are awesome and entertaining. I think it is set in 1979 NYC- the movie is SO BAD that it's SO GOOD. U too will reference the movie and the dialogue after you have it loaded into your memory bank. It's immediatetly entertaining, gives u some laughs (although it's doubtful that it was the original intention of the director) & it's a great little time capsule. Definitely a great source for Halloween costume ideas.<br />Can You Dig It!!!
B002KEDQJQ|5.0|good it was a great flick very intense and good story loved watching it , it was great very good
B0025WX2YW|4.0|I loved this series. Very interesting even though a historical. I watched it in one sitting. That's how interesting I found the series
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Do you love this book?<br />I do Augustus<br />I do<br /><br />This book the most hilarious book I have ever read my copy is filled with highlighted quotes that I find enjoyable or just important points in the story I highly recommend this book
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It took me awhile to get through the last level but it was fun.  I thought that I would prefer hints but when I finally beat the last level without using a hint I felt like I had accomplished something.  I am waiting for the next levels
B00DU74U74|2.0|Cant really say much more. I was persuaded to watch this by my good lady wife...basically its 90 minutes of my life I wont get back. Bad acting, plot, special effects. I went off to watch Sponge Bob with the kids in the end..
B0011EU0NG|4.0|Geeat film for children. Dick Van Dyke?Fuggetaboutit. Classic family entertainment.  Fun for the whole family. Takes you back to a time when rated G wasn't uncool
193700788X|5.0|I loved the ending, even though I am aware that others panned it.<br />Sam is a good fit for Sookie, as I could never see her turning vamp.<br />I thought it was going to be the final book in the series, but I learned<br />later that there will be one more - looking forward to that!
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Great series. I loved, loved this series. It is very interesting. The characters and story, though historical is captivating. The acting was great
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I love this show--love the way they shot the scenes, LOVE the acting, plot, scripts... Very well done series, love the BBC!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Would have rated it 4 1/2 stars....<br /><br />Action packed film that didn't seem like over 2 hours.  Loved seeing the characters when they were young.
B00DCP0082|2.0|I want to start off by saying that the two disc set is definitely worth the price.  The 'RE KILL' bonus disc is a must for old school Annihilator fans.  While I will never be a big fan of Dave Padden's vocals, the new re recorded versions of classics such as \\"Alice In Hell,\\" \\"Stonewall,\\" and \\"Never, Never land,\\" are beefed up with a excellent production and performance, I even find Padden's vocals more than tolerable on these re recordings.  If this set was sold as just 'Re Kill,' I would have bought it for the price.<br /><br />Now onto 'Feast,' as mentioned in another review, this isn't Annihilator's best album.  If your a fan of Annihilator, it is mostly if not entirely because of Jeff Water's ability to bring the riff.  Jeff once again writes some amazing riffs, riffs that will have you throwing the horns and yelling \\"hell yeah.\\" Unfortunately, Jeff lost his sewing kit, because this album is put together horrendously.  Other than the first two tracks, which are sure to be fan favorites, this album falls apart, riff by riff.  The songs greatly lack continuity, this lack of continuity will make long term Annihilator fans banging there head not in a metal induced frenzy, but rather out of frustration.  I will say that nearly all the songs have some good sections, but when combined with the not so good sections, the song is flat lined.  Me personally, I don't get tracks like \\"No Surrender,\\" \\"Perfect Angel Eyes,\\" or \\"Wrapped,\\" with their strange song structures and riff / melody selections.  I also don't get Jeff's decision to once again have Danko Jones sing a track (\\"Wrapped\\") on this album.  The only thing that Jeff accomplished with this decision, is that Danko's lackluster vocals distract the listener from the fact that they are listening to a Annihilator album.  Other than the first two tracks and a solid production, there isn't much here for Annihilator fans to sink their teeth into.  Lastly, Padden once again came to the 'Feast' empty handed and chokes on a lackluster performance.  'Feast' is only about a 1.7 for me folks.
B008469DGY|3.0|It's a fancy Paper Toss. Simple as that. Don't buy it. Seriously. Don't buy it. Also, its golf without golfing.
159420411X|4.0|The author applies science to predictions.  Some of the explanations are<br />a little hard to follow. because I am not very interested in sports. However, it would be easy to look up a specific prediction<br />if you were developing a rationale.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|The data provided is quite limited and I prefer the AccuWeather app.  I purchased this app with complimentary Amazon coins but I would not spend $1.99 real money for it.
B009CF3P7E|5.0|If your a fan of the original television show or even a newcomer to the franchise, this film is very entertaining.  From the beginning to the end was intrigued and impressed!
0316228583|5.0|This book was a page turner and the details of everyday life, especially for the impoverished was so accurate.<br />Hope Ms Rowling will write more of this genre.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best shows on television.  Can't wait to see the rest of Season 3, and looking forward to season 4.
0307474259|4.0|Good information I wish we all had.  It is too bad we have to learn fat causes when we had the answer earlier this century.
125000098X|5.0|Can't wait for the next one in the series.Amazxing wrighter. He has the ability to make you keep turning the pages. What a gift.
B008MM9630|5.0|Love the graphics. The ideas and concepts are VERY cute and wonderful! Love the random emotions your Faery Character does/makes!! :D
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I enjoyed playing what I did get to play. Not sure if it was long enough to buy full game. Will have to think on it.
B000FVE3BG|4.0|I am new to collecting watches but absolutely love this Invicta (my first of this brand). I also have a Rolex, a Bulova, a Citizen, and an Armitron. This watch did not dissapoint me compared to my others.<br /><br />The color scheme is very nice with the deep blue and brass. It looks like one of the Rolex Yachtmasters.<br /><br />The only complaint I have at all is the 1/10 second chronograph is a tiny bit lopsided looking when it spins around. However this is nothing a jeweler couldnt fix for $25.... or someone with steady hands and some watch tools.<br /><br />The price was great for the quality.
B001JI5DRC|1.0|I applied a code to download this movie that I got from universal. The code was good and applied to my account.<br />I then did the 1 click to buy the movie and it still charged me for the movie and removed  my free code
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a cool game it makes you really think of all the spots to look and had to use math to figure out parts
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have deliberately slowed down my reading as the author sped up time in the novel.  I always love Hosseini's books and this one is just as good.  Wonderfully descriptive, moving, beautifully written; a great story.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a pretty useful app. It helps me know when I need to turn my device off and charge it. The notifications are AMAZING.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Its a really fun game once you get the hang of it. Would like to have more energy to play longer. G5 always has great games to choose from.
B00AG297GK|4.0|Pretty funny movie.  You either hate him or you love him.  My son and I cracked up at several scenes.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|This is the first time that I have seen the very first episode.  Now I understand why it is entitled Grey's Anatomy.  The sound and the quality of the picture was excellent.<br /><br />I am an  Health Educator and Health Advocate, and though I know that not all of the aspects of this show are 100% accurate, I still enjoy it and the characters.
0399255370|5.0|Hilarious!!  In my families nightly rotation.  My son quotes the crayon to friends at school and makes everyone laugh.  Best kid book 2013
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing bingo blitz! Easy to learn and lots of fun! There's different rooms to play in! And slots too!
B00ESY77LO|4.0|Great movie, I was really suprised by it! Loved the new music with the old style of clothing and cars. Would definitely recomend this movie!
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Another great Cd from 5FDP.  Same great sound as usual and lyrics to get you pumped up for anything.  Keep up the good work guys.
B00199B2Z8|5.0|This book is very well written. I actually laughed out loud at some of his descriptions. Bill Bryson is a wonderful writer
B004GUSG4M|5.0|A well crafted, good read from start to finish. At one point I thought I had it figured out, but no, I was totally wrong.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I've played this game on ninjakiwi on the computer, but the kindle version works great and then I can play while lounging around. Nothing but positive things to say about BTD5. Lots of great tracks and towers with upgrades- easy, medium, hard difficulties. Plenty of ways to mix up the game to always keep it interesting.
0345803485|1.0|With all the hype and fuss that surrounded it I had to read it for myself. This book is drivel, derivative, poorly executed and it's original source seeps out of every page; i.e. a Twilight fanfiction website.<br />I can see why immature pubescent girls may enjoy this rubbish in the same way they enjoy the Twilight books and films but why does it appeal to anyone over the age of 13?<br />What makes it worse for me is that if a man had written this book he would have been accused of misogyny and hung, drawn and quartered in Trafalgar Square by every right minded woman.<br />Since when did abusive, controlling behaviour become sexy?<br />As a piece of erotic fiction it just doesn't work. There is barely a plot, the dialogue is clunky and is ridden with so many cliches I had to shower many many times to get rid of the stench.<br />I watched an interview with the writer who proudly stated that her book was being read by people who don't normally read books. She said this with a sense of pride. Possibly that is because it reads like it is written by someone who doesn't read books. In fact it reads like someone whose main source of reading material is celebrity magazines and their ilk.<br />The book does have one redeeming feature; it can be recycled into something worthwhile and helpful.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I got this for my Grandson on my Kindle Fire, and he wanted to play it all day, and would have had If I  didn't make him take a break..
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|I've got to admit that after listening to it the first time I thought for sure they lost their edge but, after listening to it several times over the last week I'm really starting to like it.  It has more of a Metallica feel to it for sure compared to their older stuff but, I really like Metallica too.  I'm glad their continuing to put out great music and it's refreshing to hear a different sound.  Can't wait to see them Live next month!!!
B004UPANAI|5.0|I'm a very late viewer of the XMen movies.  I purchased a DVD not long ago that had the first three movies.  I watched all of them in one sitting.  Then I had to ask a coworker what the other movies were.  And as she was telling me, I was simultaneously ordering the other two.  I have watched this and now I know how they got started.  I'm now hooked!!!  I recommend the whole collection.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|What a medley of stars who bring their wit and gregariousnes to the screen in this shoot-um-up spy story. The goods guys are kinda bad guys, but then again they are out to stop even badder guys. The interaction between the actors on the screen is wonderful. A great fun night movie for your friends. There is mystery, suspense and romance, every thing to help you enjoy the action.
B0083Q4NCO|5.0|I saved a lot of money on one of my son's summer reading book. The book was in perfect condition for a used book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Haven't had it long, but so far this game is really fun! No problem loading or using the app, and its a good time killer.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|It has a good premIse, but the execution was slow, and the ending left me disappointed. It seemed as though the director got caught up in the story but forgot that it had to end, so threw together an ending that left pretty much every question I had unanswered. Okay as a DVD, glad I didn't pay to see it in theaters.
B00E0ZEDI6|5.0|Without a doubt, I've actually became a fan.  The beat, the lyrics, the voices.....<br />Then when you factor in not having to worry about the language, they're perfect
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|it flowed, wasn't too long, had decent effects.  No complaints on the acting, its DREDD done right.  I would recommend it!
B0008ENICU|5.0|I also bought the new version with Meg Ryan...  But this timeless classic is a wonderful addition to my vid. library... you'll laugh , and you'll cheer
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game makes you think and rethink your strategy as you progress.  I have finished all of the easy one's ha!  Now I am on normal.  It took me 11/2 hours for the rose in level three.  Do not under estimate this incredible complicated logic game.  I hope when I finish the next 100, there will be another colored Crosssme ii our there.  You won't be disappointed if you like a challenge.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|My wife is hooked on Mahjong. Myself those tiles drive me crazy.  But she loves this app she can play on her Kindle HD.
0786168765|5.0|Sent this audio book to an old friend, who is losing her eyesight, and loves books about India.<br />She says she thinks it will take her the rest of her life to listen to this epic, but when she curls up in her favorite chair, puts her feet up, it's the highlight of her day.
0316228532|4.0|I felt like a resident in the small town of Pagford, England. I<br />had a little trouble with some of the UK words and expressions that<br />were unfamiliar to me, but all in all it was well written, and lots of fun.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Based on a true story. This move has a unique story line. Good acting in a challenging environment. If you like a good story of humanity then try this one. Yes there is nudity and sex in this movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter was playing game on her iPad and as I like logic puzzles I decided to download it to my kindle. Big mistake! Very addictive, housework ignored, dinner not cooked. Great game and it was free!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This one of the best tv series I have watched.  Well acted, a great story line, funny at times and even cheeky in one episode. I like good BELIEVABLE science fiction and this fits the bill. Who wouldn't love the idea of alternate universe. Good stuff, addictive and totally smart viewing.
B008469DGY|4.0|This game isn't golf. Its more of a driving range game. Basically golf bullseye. The one perk I will give this game. The graphics are really good. Just wish it was an actual golf game with courses.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Bought this after sending back another product from some other company. This is amazing, slim, light enough and no need to carry any extra cords.<br /><br />And the best part is that it charges my S2 (1650 mAh) approx. 2.5-3 times.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|What a great CD of BLACKBERRY SMOKE !!!  I've played it over & over .... really a fan of their music !!!!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|The production design is old school western but the story, acting, and sound track is all modern. Good original story with a twist at the end.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|We love this show! It is by turns gripping, funny, tense, witty, and always entertaining. The chemistry between the characters is fantastic and makes you want to know what is going to happen next.
B003B02O0U|4.0|Typical of John Grisham, this story keeps you turning the pages in well written english, with believable characters. If you like thrillers you will love this!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this series and frankly miss the characters now that I'm done reading the 3 books.  I thought this was written extremely well from a woman's perspective.  Loved the interaction of Ana, her subconscious and her inner goddess.  I can't wait for EL James next book.  Sign me up!
B00CWV8X04|3.0|Good plot and development...ending could have had more details.  The romance should have had more scenes as that would have completed the story line.
B002FQOI0A|4.0|I often enjoy trying books that are deemed to be excellent young people's reading (Boy in the Striped Pajamas, Book Thief.) This is not deep emotionally but it is a delightful read. Sweet story, well-driven plot, good characters. Liked it.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Look, don't watch this movie especially if you are approaching 40. Story is bad as well as the acting. Having turned 40 recently this is not what you want to watch.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|One very quickly notices that the author has an axe to grind and the book is not as objective as advertised.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Flynn writes well, defining characters and creating a very good plot that keeps you wondering what comes next. No to crazy about the ending; see if you like it, you'll have a good time on the road. I'm going to try her first book next. She's definitely worth looking at further.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Terrific!  Season 3 continues to be as good as seasons 1 and 2.  Can't wait to watch 4 and 5.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|As all social networking sites this one does not disappoint. It's Twitter; what more is there to say really. LoL
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Kinda sorta wondered about the characters but honestly the writing is so circular and repetitive and the characters are such emotional wrecks who cannot seem to get out of their own way, but then the plot and good writing is not what is selling these books.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This is an amazingly true story about how we got some of the folks out of the iranian embassy when it was over run by violent students during the revolution.
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|Decent product.  However, I discovered that you must have the built-in micro-USB cable plugged back into the other side for the other USB port to charge.  I was hoping that I could charge 2 devices at once with this using the built-in micro-USB cable and the USB port with another cable simultaneously, but this is not the case.  Aside from this, great product.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I play this game every day. It's challenging yet fast paced. I find this game very relaxing and play it before going to bed.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a great way to exercise your hand-eye coordination.  There is a timed version of the game or you can just play it for enjoyment without that pressure on yourself!!  Lots of fun!
B00CH26TL8|3.0|For something to waist time, it's an ok game but there are many others much more fun than this game. Of this type of game; however it's a good time.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|great scifi flic, best one of 2013... and who doesn't love a show with Morgan Freeman in it?  That guy could read a phone book and make it interesting.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|Interesting movie.  Great effects with a &#34;didn't see that coming&#34; at the end.  Perhaps a little cheesy in some spots but overall well worth it.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I'm not able to use it because I don't have computer connection to by my bed.It would be handy otherwise
B0064MPXFA|4.0|First two seasons were good.  Not sure the third will hold up.  Was wondering how long she would hold out.
B008469DGY|5.0|This is a very fun golf game very fun for me and the kids. Great control with just the Flick of a finger. Don't hesitate to get this game cannot wait to play it on my Kindle as well.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I've been a Yahoo mail girl since they began in the nineties. I also have gmail and outlook accounts, however my Yahoo mail account is my favorite.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|It was not what I expected... I wouldn't recommend it or watch it again.  I expected more music than there was.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Captivating.<br /><br />better than the movie. It fleshes out the characters much more than the movie.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the rest of the trilogy!
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|Good movie. Family friendly and especially entertaining to children. Creative music and interesting story plot and finding the truth about yourself.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a Kindle, and now also a Samsung Galaxy Note!  Kindle for Android is easy, fun and as yet I have not been dissapointed!!!  And yes, I get all my books that were for the Kindle now sent to my Samsung with no extra cost (well I paid for them of course for my Kindle).  It is just all around good.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app puts me to sleep every night. I love all the different options so its not the same every time
B00BRPDO14|4.0|If you like Jose Rodriguez, then you've probably already bought this album. This has his trademark mumble tenor backed by his compelling rhythmic guitar strumming, but now with a band to give even more texture and depth to the sound. This is less Nick Drake than his solo work, and more Arcade Fire. The songs are driven, addictive, and a little haunting. I only wish the album was longer.
B005VOXPO8|5.0|I took my kids to the zoo and told them to each pick an animal they wanted to buy.  I would then talk to the cashier to have them sent to our house.  This elephant cost me $7.96 on Amazon with free shipping when it was $14.99 at the zoo.  I also think my kids were more excited to receive it in the mail then had we just brought it home that day.
B008J34466|5.0|I have a few songs I love, the rest...uuugh, not so much.. But ok cd if you like all of Pink's songs.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|It's awesome to get these four movies in a single Blu-Ray set, but beware!  The versions of the movies on these Blu-Rays appear to be the theatrical cuts, not the Director's Cuts (which I already owned on DVD and was planning on replacing with this set).  The additional and extended scenes do appear to be included on the discs as extras, though.
B00BFBSV72|4.0|My boys ages 8 and 5 love this game.  I also love this game, not exactly like the old school Sonic, but close enough!
B000JMKRKC|3.0|it was an interesting story. very complex. things tat happened in the book were more than I expected. you will have to read it to understand.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This novel was utterly incredible.  It was sometimes so intense that I would stop reading it in a moment but still have my mind in Wuthering Heights, as if every aspect from the novel had just crawled out into my life.  There is a lot of violence in this work, however, and sometimes you are overwhelmed by it.  Also, the language of Nelly, the housekeeper, seems a little unrealistic as her voice as a narrator is very eloquent and overpowering.  The novel can be confusing because it starts when most of the action has already occurred...sometimes it is hard to keep up.  However, if you are savvy enough to be able to keep up with the different times and generations the plot throws at you, the reading will be very fruitful and enlightening.  Wuthering Heights is by far one of the best novels I have ever encountered.
1616550414|2.0|the art in the book was pretty good, but really focuses on the most recent Zelda game, skyward sword.<br />it had next to nothing for Majora's Mask, Link to the Past, and Link's Awakening.<br />I almost feel like I could've done an internet search and compiled my own gallery of artwork from the different guides and scans from manuals and been more complete. I bought it for $20 and is nice to look through, but I felt disappointed when lots of my favorite art pieces from official Nintendo literature were missing once I got to the end.<br /><br />Maybe they should not have named it \\"Historia\\" when it focuses on the last game.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I have loved nearly each song on this cd.. I would love to see them live, looking forward to hearing more from this band.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is still very addictive. LOVE IT.  I play it on my kindle while waiting for Dr appointments. It is quite and doesn't bother anyone.
B009WUBERW|4.0|I didn't expect a lot from the sequel except some fun and was very pleasantly surprised! A lot more humor, a lot more action (didn't think that was possible!), and more action legends! It won't win any oscars but if you want a movie to enjoy with your lady, snacks, and cold drinks? This is a hit!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Nice looking on the night stand and very handy for travel. It's best to keep it plugged in when possible to keep from draining the battery fairly quickly.
B00991TCOG|5.0|If you like Lindsey Stirling or violins, this is a great buy. Very talented artist and the violin is all Lindsey.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Each episode makes you want to watch the one coming next!  great entertainment without violence and nasty words! Be sure to watch.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I Love this CD and the price was very good.  I will be buying more cd's in the future for sure.
B00957T6X6|1.0|You look at the press reviews and all the great reviews from people who bought this set and you expect a quality read. J.R.R. Tolkien, indeed! I wonder who paid them to say that because I seriously doubt they're ever read a Tolkien book.<br /><br />When I read, I expect to find a plot and an end goal. Somehow those have gotten lost in the quest to see how many gratuitous sex scenes it will take to drive up the word count to acceptable levels for fantasy novels. More time is spent on those sex scenes that anything else.<br /><br />I've read better at 1/4 the price. Unfortunately because I was stupid and bought the boxed Kindle set I can't return the unread portions.<br /><br />The worst part of it is, I can usually struggle the worst prose even if, at the end, I still absolutely hate it.<br /><br />No wonder the youth of this country lacks reading skills. There's nothing worth reading anymore. Instead, they're fed tripe as if it is filet mignon.
B009M8TA20|5.0|I am going to the Ireland V Sweden World Cup qualifier in the Aviva Stadium tomorrow, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic is playing.<br />Yesterday afternoon I bought his book and read all 332 pages in one sitting, finishing at 5 a.m.<br />I like sports biographies.  I really liked this one.  The English translation is excellent.<br />There are good insights into the major European club managers and players.  It took 14 hours to read. I need to sleep.<br />Thanks Zlatan.  Well done.  You get to keep the biography match ball.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|The most mature film of Sacha Baron Cohen. Well done, especially the caricature of Geddafi-Saddam style dictatorship. Still some scenes are over the top, like the jokes with the beheaded head of the blackman or when the doppelganger addresses the UN making a mes with the urine...<br />I am glad that after Bruno he recovered with this nice production.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was behind with watching this series. I was only able to find season 3 here. I was a surprise from the beginning to the end. The storyline and the acting is amazing. I can't wait for season 4.
B004FEJ3VY|3.0|I gave this to a child who was turning 7.  He is a very bright young boy.  Does great in school, speaks two languages and builds many beautiful Lego creations.  His parents said he liked Transformers.  When I visited the other day I asked how he liked it and to show me how it worked.  He said he liked it but he had not been able to change it because it was to hard.  I gave it to him over a month ago.  His mother showed me the instructions and she and I tried and sat there laughing because we couldn't get past instruction number 3.  I'm 62 and she is 32.  There were many more than 3 instructions.<br />His mother told me that another friend had this toy and the mother was always the one to do the transformation.<br /><br />This was incorrectly marked for 5+.
B008469DGY|5.0|I like the concept. its pretty fun, I just downloaded and the tutorial is short and sweet. u can pretty much dive right in. awards are cool...
B0001CCXZW|4.0|Excelent quality of the image and nice presentation, but the boxes where the DVDs came were poorly glued. Apart of that it was perfect.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I had to watch this film for class and write a paper on it. This is not something I would have watched myself, but it was good, very informative, and eye opening.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|Works great for playing music from my phone (Droid Razr Maxx) into an iPod docking station.  Great price, very quick shipping.  Very satisfied customer.
B000W91RUG|5.0|What I expected, arrived on time and my sister was very happy when she recived them for her birthday this year.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|I like this show, clean the whole family can watch this show.  I like how they bring in stores from all fairy tales and intertwine them.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I love this app but I wish u can get more rare fish I can plant slot of mystery seeds and I get a couple.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It doesn't waste battery and spent have to be on to work like the other ones tht I've tried I LOVE IT!!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|I've never read the books but I really enjoyed the storyline. This story inspired me to actually go and READ the trilogy now when before I had no intentions on reading it.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|I enjoy watching action movies. 24 gives me the action I'm looking for, but puts it in little chunks that I can watch for hours upon hours. Or just one 40 min episode.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|A nice light read which takes you from the Cote d´Azur to the States and keeps you guessing until the very last moment.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I chose this game, because it reminded me of playing Mario Bros on Nintendo. I feel frustrated on getting to the next level. I don't play it too often.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Overall we liked the idea of this movie but it was a little lacking in the plot and had lots of holes.
1416575464|2.0|I order this book used and it was listed in good condition.  To me that means some writing perhaps, folded pages relatively clean.  This book was dirty and ripped 40% up the spine.  It should have been listed as fair at best and priced accordingly.  Rubbish.
B0018PJEYY|1.0|In my universe, I would bring charges of \\"depraved indifference to human suffering\\" against the good folks that remastered this album. Having listened to the original LP countless times in my youth, I am infinitely familiar with every note and effect on it. When I started playing the remastered mp3s I very nearly collapsed in a fit of apoplexy. Surely I was in a terrible dream! Someone must be playing an evil trick on me! But no. Dizzy and sweating, I skipped from track to track and fell ever further into despair. I wanted to pull my teeth out. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING! WHO ALLOWED THEM TO DO THIS! Okay, enough of the purple prose. You get the idea. The remastered album sucks beyond description. Save your money. More importantly, save your soul. If you haven't already listened to it - don't. And if you have heard it and actually think you like it, go to confession and beg for absolution. God might forgive you, but it's a stretch. FULL DISCLOSURE: This is the first review of any kind that I have ever posted to the web. That's a good measure of just how upset I was. I'm okay now. If you read this far, I thank you, Bob Pennico (aka Stu Webster), former DJ.
B00DM12WO6|5.0|Just like Claire of the Moon, Elena Undone always makes me feel better.  So grateful for it.  I liked it so much that after watching it more than 30 times I bought it.  Nicole Conn is a great writer she knows how to bring the anticipation to an amazing level and can bring heartbreak and heart healing to her characters that leave me feeling like I made friends.  To me when a writer can make her characters be more like friends to her readers it's always a five star rating.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|Wanting to refresh my memory I got this book again and am very glad I did. A book that simply does not go out of fashion.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|I chose this game also because it was similar to the Mario Bros on Nintendo. I like going to different levels, but I do get frustrated when I can't figure out where to go next.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Good look back at some great music.  An incredible amount of some of the best music of the day.  Well worth listening and watching.  I bought the album.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is pretty fun. It passes the time and keeps you entertained if you have nothing else to do.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|After paying for this I figured I would be add free! Wrong,  in app adds for the other apps from this company are quite annoying. The app itself was clean and efficient like the stock alarm. Enjoyed the lockscreen digital blue clock. Removed thou due to ads . Would reinstall if ads are removed.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy set up. Works great. Worth more than the price. I recommend this to anyone who'd rather watch the TV screen than the computer screen.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I couldn't help myself, loved this series. You feel a bit compelled to continue due to the plot twists and characters. Looking color ward to the next book!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Really good story with a \\"love really does mean something\\" motif. Well cast, and good development. Think I'll watch it again right now! Love McConaughey's rugged good looks!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Still the best weather app out there! I still like it because it continues to do what it's designed for. Now there are some extras that just make it more fun. Not just something for the weather geek.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|I picked up an episode here and there and was thrilled to death that Amazon had the full seasons up. The characters are great and the twists to the stories reminds me of a legal based &#34;House&#34;. I highly recommend this to anyone.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|its fast.fun.but WAY too easy if your looking for a fun game to do while waiting or killing time but its toatly fun I would recommended this game
B005HED11Y|5.0|Loved it in my youth now my son is discovering it thanks to Amazon prime. Thank you for making it available
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book! MIND TOTALLY BLOWN! I did enjoy the great majority of it, except for the ending.  Bought the rest of her books and halfway through the next.
B009YG2ND8|1.0|FF3 is a well balanced game with solid combat and inventory systems. I've got no complaints about the game's mechanics. As one of, if not the most expensive titles available for the Kindle, this rpg needs something more than a balanced system; it needs a compelling story that keeps you wanting to come back for more and interesting, well developed characters you care about. This game has neither. The story is the stereotypical warriors if light claptrap that might have sold titles in the early 90s but is now so done to death as to actually be worse than nothing. The characters are, if it's possible, more bland than the story. I quit playing about halfway through because I couldn't be bothered to care any more. It would have been a lousy title at $5. At 3 times the price, it's 3 times the ripoff.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Great classic rock style album, very talent musicians that clearly have an excellent synergy between them.  Amazing vocals and catchy lyrics!  Congrats to Mike Portnoy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|there have even been a few duh moments. I. get a kick out of it. it is a fun way to pass the time
B0097EWK3A|3.0|I thought the game was fun, but too much back and forth throughout the challenge to make it great.  Could have spent more thought on making it more thought provoking.
B008220BLG|5.0|I saw this in the movie theater and I just had to buy it. I'm not normally into zombie movies but this was hilarious.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I read the book and now have watched the movie with Amazon Prime's video streaming in HD. It is a good movie, in that, it seemed to follow the book.
B002O2THRO|4.0|I did not like the tragic part of the movie, after all the hardship just to get the girl he end dead.
B008JFUO4U|1.0|It was too hard for me to follow; I don't know what I expected but I did not get it
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|I got to watch this with my dad and since hes not fond of videogames, i thought he would only watch the first 20 minutes of it..<br />We ended up watching the whole thing and was asking all these questions about whats going on and why whats happening. I think hes a fan now ^^
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Once you start playing this you will be hooked on trying to escape.  It is a fun game but challenging enough to keep you coming back for more and more. I will admit that I have been stuck a couple of times..  Makes you remember things and have fun.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Somehow I never heard about this movie until long after it was released and that saddens me. This is honestly one of my favorite movies. Its hilarious and has an awesome cast. Don't try to make it into your normal spy movie though.
0143120530|4.0|I bought &#34;Moonwalking with Einstein&#34; because I thought it would help me improve my memory.  It did not.  The most help in that arena was the following tip in the epilogue:  &#34;With focus, motivation, and above all, time, the mind can be trained to do extraordinary things.”  Nevertheless, the book was very interesting and worth reading.  It mostly covers the US and international memory championships and the extraordinary feats of memory achieved by the participants.  It also includes numerous interesting tidbits about the human mind and memory.
B0059DQHHI|4.0|I like the substance of the movie, strong story, intriguing, a lot of emotional elements.<br />This story has a lot of forgiveness and unfogettable moments, it makes you cry.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|There is fact based dialog as well as fiction...Great viewing for all the family..Be sure to have plenty of popcorn...
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Probably the  best Hitchcock film that I have ever seen  this is a  must see movie for classic  movie buffs
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you love Fifty Shades you will like this book. No red room but still just as hot. A guaranteed good read!
B005S9ELVC|5.0|I love this movie. I don't normally like Ryan Gosling that much but he's awesome in this movie. Actually the entire cast is awesome and it really transports you back to the time it was happening. I love the complexities of the characters and how much time they spent getting the costumes right.
B0011Z5IUK|5.0|Shows the range of Led Zeppelin's capabilities and influences better than LZ 1.I think it's the example of the growth of their repertoire all the way through Physical Graffiti.
B001BANK32|5.0|You must read The Shining to really appreciate the intricacies of the plot and the true &#34;STORY&#34; King put down to paper. Kubric's movie version does not touch the horror King wrote about this haunted hotel. Read the novel and try to forget the movie and you will truly appreciate the master of horror stories tale of seclusion and madness
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is a great charging case. Protects, charges, and extends the charge.<br />I only wish all headsets offered this type of charging case!
B001MTENOC|5.0|If your open minded, this book can really give you some insight into another realm of thinking about our afterlife. It's not filled with medical or scientific jargan. My wife was worried about that before reading, she made it through just fine. Good read overall.
1400082773|4.0|Good read. inspiring story weather you like Obama or not.. he is not my favorite right now but, I still like the book.
B0051XJ9YE|5.0|Great price for a hard to find &#34;bad guy&#34; car as my son requested. He loved this little guy and plays with him all the time
0425252868|5.0|My husband loved this book. We had heard about it from a friend and I ordered it for him to read
1451695195|3.0|It was an interesting read given the perspective from a neurosurgeon point of view, however I expected more.  The book was as described, my beef is with the info in the book.
B00D41H2PS|4.0|Very Enjoyable and engaging. Challenging enough to keep you moving but not so challenging that you give up. Fun game!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I watched this while on a flight. It was a good storyline & Matthew McConaughey was awesome. Not so sure what all the fuss about for Reese Witherspoon as her role was rather small in this one.<br />I would recommend this one.
0316017922|5.0|Book came on time and in a good condition. I loved reading this book! Author is a genius. It is about factors of success in America.Such an eye opener.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Purchased this because it was cheaper than renting when it first came out. like all the HP movies, it was good
0307476073|3.0|Too much foul language in the first 3 chapters.<br /><br />The first part of the book spent too much time on just chatter instead of getting down to the real subject<br />of the book.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My nephew will love this for his birthday.  The packaging the DVDs re is is perfect.  Quality was as I expected.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|Music was funny having modern music mixed with a 50s style movie. Could have expanded on the book background info more.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|For the most part I enjoyed the movie as a whole, but Oblivian began with a very slow build up to the action.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|My 15 year old son loved this series.  He watched it twice and cannot believe it the series was cancelled.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|i knew going into this album, i would NOT be disappointed. and i was more than blown away by this album. (again, its a habit saying \\"album\\"). i have every edition. from the \\"Hail To The King Limited Treasure Chest\\" to the \\"Deluxe\\" and the \\"Original\\". why? because i could and i wanted to see all of the extras and hear the \\"Lighter\\" song (St. James) to the tribute of Jimmy \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan who also called himself \\"Fiction\\". look, they have grown up with every album from \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\" to this more than beautifully rock filled jam. there is NOT bad song on this album. and who cares about the hair that M. Shadows grew out???!!! i remember when i told (still to me) an awesome friend \\"watch, after \\"Nightmare\\", M. Shadows will grow out his hair\\" and he did! HAIR has NOTHING to do with MUSIC. but, if you pay attention, his hair was always different. from shaved to the skin to short hair, from the beginning - he had purple bangs. anyways, this album showcases maturity, growth, but yet still has that Rock N Roll and head banging sides. but still, i can clench my fists to some tunes - \\"Shepherd of Fire\\", \\"Planets\\" \\"Doing Time\\" and sit back, relax and say \\"wow, how beautiful that song is\\" - \\"Crimson Day and even parts of \\"Heretic\\". i cant wait till Oct. 19 here in Dallas, Texas!!! people have asked me - \\"what is your favorite song, album, etc from Avenged Sevenfold?\\" my answer? \\"all of them\\". they all (songs) - \\"each one holds a part of my heart\\". am i obsessive about A7X??? NO. again, NO. they are just one of the FEW bands that touches my heart. not only that, THEY hold and treat their fans like they are a part of their family. in my opinion Arin Ilejay has earned his stripes and of course i didnt get all worried. the band wouldnt have hired him, if he couldnt keep up and didnt have a particular attitude. im curious what Beast & The Harlot, Seize The Day (which saved my life) and other classics will sound like when Arin hits the sticks. BUT, if all they playis the singles and just the album is fine with me. the change already happened and honestly, in my opinion, from the singles with Arin to a whole album, you can tell he is one killer drummer. he has even went on record and said, \\" i dont want to replace The Rev or try to sound like him\\", that took guts and earned another stripe of welcoming him to the A7X family.
