B009I2UH2W|5.0|Bought this with the hopes it would work with an Otter Box Defender case, none of the previous reviews state it and the tip does look \\"fatter\\" than the apple charging cable. wanted to let everyone know it fits just fine.
B005IEF27O|5.0|I was originially skeptical of Jay Lane but he relieved all doubt on Naugahyde and seeing Primus at MOOGfest.<br />PRIMUSSUCKS!

B009FZFONO|5.0|This season really blew my mind in terms of action and character. The Governor was superb and Rick's development as a leader and a father was great. Can't wait for more!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|As a 23-year-old post-grad, I honestly didn't think this movie would have a lot to offer. I was wrong! Might just be a child at heart, but I loved the story, the characters, and the animation. Probably won't be the last time I watch it.
1780721676|5.0|I am enjoying the book as much as the diet!  Easy to follow with alot of humor and great information!
B005K17RU0|2.0|Different on the 9 inch and 7 inch.  Maybe an update.  More like a downgrade.  Whoever did this should be canned.  Now I need to find another weather app.  Don't waste your money.  You will get the same from the free app.
B0006MT314|4.0|Gave it to a friend. We listened to it and tried to remember which episodes went with each songs. Great collection of one tree hill songs.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Thirty Seconds to Mars is my favorite band. This album had a little bit of everything sound wise. I have all three of their albums and can't wait for the fourth which is coming out on May 21, 2013.  If you like Thirty Seconds to Mars music get it. It rocks.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|I've always loved Van Morrison but haven't bought any of his CD's before, so the Greatist Hits was perfect. It has all his great songs on it.

B00BGIC3T6|5.0|This movie had me laughing all night.  If your married with kids and thirty something and you have a sense of humor. This is perfect. The cast is fantastic!!! And it's so true it's scary!!! :)

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I saw this film at a theater on the big screen. I went alone and found myself emotionally overwhelmed. Sitting alone I cried for the fallen angel, Fantine played by Anne Hathaway. As I watched I found myself identifying with her character and her character's suffering, disappointment and despair. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean found the essence of his character whether he was hating, stealing or later kind and charitable. His emotion was always right there and I didn't have to guess at what he was feeling as Valjean at any time during the film. Russell Crowe, on the other hand, played the part just as he played Gladiator. He was Russell Crowe singing. I was taken with Amanda Siefried as Cosette. Her performance showed a depth of emotion that I haven't seen in her before. Her flute-like voice was perfect and totally complemented the company of stronger voices that could have overwhelmed but didn't. Eddie Redmayne as Marius was a wonderful surprise. I saw him in Elizabeth the Golden Years as the assassin and while he was convincing in that role he was exceptional as Marius. His performance could be light and sweet or painfully sad and suffering as required. His was a performance that sent me into tears. The young men of the Revolution were wonderful. Not one slacked off because they were in a chorus. Each stood out as his own memorable person. There's nothing to say about the young boy who played Gavroche. He took the street urchin role to a whole new level and never missed a beat. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonhomme Carter were perfect as innkeeper and wife. The customers of the inn (the dissolutes) were truly gross, but that was the point. This film is even more amazing when you realize the actors were singing their roles in real time. I've watched this film at least ten times since it was delivered and it didn't lose any impact going from the big screen to my old 32 inch 17 year-old Sony. I still cry.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel-Day Lewis WAS as you would imagine President Lincoln to be!  Spielburg presented the times in the light of how they really were.  It was a wonderful history lesson to the young and reminder of what we had learned about our country's beginning to our older generation.
0061950726|4.0|\\"Orphan Train\\" alternates between Molly's current day story and Vivian's tale which begins in the 1920's.  Kline interweaves their adventures back and forth in time.  Both of them have lost their families in tragic situations.  Both are orphans who struggle to find a place in the world.  Eventually they meet and help one another heal despite the 70 plus age gap.<br /><br />I was afraid this book would have some harrowing incidents and it does but Kline backs away from the full horror of many of them which is a blessing but also a somewhat of a disservice.  The Orphan Trains from the beginning of the 20th century were devised as a way to find kids homes but also as a way for farmers and other business owners to find unpaid workers.  It was before laws protected workers and children from exploitation.  Of course some of the kids hit the lottery and found wonderful lives but that was mostly the infants.  Vivian was 9 when she boarded the train.  Her experiences weren't quite so idyllic.  Molly is caught in the current day foster care system gong from family to family.  Vivian and Molly share a sense of being lost and feeling unloved and exploited.  They're too frequently in physical danger as well but they're both survivors.  Kline's ending is sentimental but extremely satisfying and the interaction between a 90 year old and a 17 year old was heartwarming.  If you can get past the sentimentality you'll enjoy \\"Orphan Train\\".  This history is fascinating.<br /><br />This review is based on an e-galley provided by the publisher.
B003L77GRO|5.0|This is one of the coolest shows... I started watching it and just got hooked from season 1 so started getting all the seasons.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm not a zombie fan, but I got sucked into this store. Gore and more gore, could have done with less than that but I couldn't stop watching it.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Sade is an exceptional artist, and we are very lucky that she came out of retirement to make music again and share this live concert performance.  Her band is first-rate and the dvd production values are exceptional.  I highly recommend the it to anyone that appreciates soulful and beautiful music, sung from the heart.  Sade's artistry is timeless.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I have two sons, ages 6 and 8. Downloaded this for the 6yr old and he can't stop playing the game. Now the 8yr old wants it on his android tablet too.  No more fighting, horseplay, or bickering...because they both are entertained, albeit in moderation, of course, with the Jurassic Park Builder.
B006N9XHLQ|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />I had heard so many amazing things about Josh Lanyon's Adrien English series, that I had to give it a try. It was my second foray into M/M Romance and I have to say I loved it!<br /><br />First and foremost this series is a mystery series that just happens to have a homosexual hero. It is in no way an erotica series, though it does have its very smexing steamy moments.<br /><br />Josh Lanyon's writing is superb, I could not put these books down. I read all five books in about 3 days, I didn't do anything else because I did not want to leave Adrien's world for even a minute.<br /><br />Adrien is a great leading man and a very interesting character. He owns a bookstore specialized in mystery books and he is also a published writer. He has written a novel about a gay theater actor at Shakespearean times that is also a sleuth.<br /><br />In each book Adrien finds himself in midst of a a different murder mystery and that can be quite tiring, but Lanyon's ability to make fun of this situation within the book and making Adrien not take himself to seriously is fantastic. The adventures and plots of these novels are great and fast-paced.<br /><br />The romance in the series has some ups and downs the main object of affection for Adrien is Jake, a gay cop that is extremely closeted. Adrien and Jake go through so much together and apart, that i could not help but cry my heart out.<br /><br />The series ended with Book 5 and I LOVED the conclusion, though I would definitely like to have read more. The end was quite satisfying and just leaves you with a very pleasant and warm feeling.<br /><br />Mystery novels are usually not my thing, unless they have some paranormal element involved lol. However i do recommend this series for any mystery fan out there.<br /><br />Originally Posted at Welcome to Larissa's Bookish Life {larissaslife DOT com}
B003QSMCKO|5.0|I really love the story and the animation in this movie. I hadn't seen it for many years and just decided to watch it again. Well done.
B003O86FMW|5.0|*Might contain minor spoilers if you haven't read The Hunger Games!<br /><br />After hearing so much about this series and the cliffhangers it has, I am really happy that i bought both this and The Hunger Games at the same time.  I read them back to back and now I'm just dying for the third and last installment of this amazing trilogy.<br /><br />Catching Fire starts off a couple months after the events in The Hunger Games and only we learn what happened in this period through flashbacks. I found that was a great way to fill the void and keep the story moving forward faster.<br /><br />Katniss won the games and now needs to deal with the consequences of her actions in the arena and keep up with the persona she created. The Capitol is not happy with her, they believe that her actions have made her the face of a new rebellion and they cannot let that happen.<br /><br />Just like the last book, this one does not stop for a second. So much action and one surprise after the other that I could not put it down. I read this book in just a few hours and I just wanted to keep going.<br /><br />After wining the games Katniss believes she is safe from the dreadful yearly drawing, however the capitol throws a curve ball at her. This year Hunger Games will be a sort of All-Star affair, where they draw the participants only from the ones that have survived the games before. Since Katniss is the only girl to ever win the games in District 12, she is going back to the arena.<br /><br />That was such a twist that i could nor help but cry. This book is full of heart rending moments, action and much more surprises that will keep you on the edge of your sit. The cliff hanger at the end is a killer and August 24th can't come soon enough!<br /><br />Originally Posted at Welcome to Larissa's Bookish Life {larissaslife DOT com}
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Just what I wanted. Very helpful to have so I can keep track of my battery. glad I downloaded it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had heard so much about this book that I just had to get it. I bought this one and the second one in the trilogy, Catching Fire, at the same time and read them both is a little more than a day =)<br /><br />The Hunger Games gives us a look in a possible future of the society and world we live in today. We follow Katniss about a century after environmental catastrophes have changed the face of North America and the former United States is now Panem, a nation divided into 12 districts and a Capitol.<br /><br />Katniss lives in district 12 and has been taking care of her mother and little sister since her father died years ago. Living in poverty, Katniss relies on unconventional methods to feed her family with the the help of her best friend Gale.<br /><br />74 years before the Districts rebelled against The Capitol and lost. As a lesson to its citizens The Capitol holds The Hunger Games every year. The Hunger Games are a reality show where 2 children of each district enter an arena and the last one left alive will be set for life. Yes, you read that right, the last one left alive! They have to kill each other!<br /><br />I have to say I was pleasantly surprise by how amazing this book is. Suzanne has created such a believable world and characters that is just so easy to get lost in their lives. It is shocking and disturbing to realize how credible is this tragic future created by her. How easy it is to believe that our utter disregard for the Earth can lead us to such a life and our society's love for reality TV and obsession  with perfection can lead us to a society as such described in The Capitol, where people look like freaks by over using plastic surgery.<br /><br />I fell completely in love with Katniss. She is such a great heroine and you can't help but root for her every step of the way. Her love and devotion for her sister is heart breaking and seeing her putting herself on the line so that her little sister doesn't have to go the brutal Games is an inspiration.<br /><br />I was utterly disturbed by this future world. The idea that watching kids killing each other is entertainment disgusted me. This book brought me to tears so many times. It is impossible to read it and not commit yourself to it completely!<br /><br />There is also romance in this book and what every fan of this series is going to ask is which Team are on? Team Peeta or Team Gale?<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a must read for any YA lover out there. Its fun, emotional, entertaining, politically engaged, disturbing, action packed, it has got it all. I did not put down this book for a second! If you haven't read The Hunger Games, what are you waiting for?<br /><br />Originally Posted at Welcome to Larissa's Bookish Life {larissaslife DOT com}tion.<br /><br />I was utterly disturbed by this future world.

B0037472NY|5.0|Bosch is the very definition of true grit and wanting to catch the bad guy, no matter what. He doesn't care about his reputation or people's personal opinions of him he only cares about catching the bad guys and ensuring that fewer people are hurt and that generally the population of Los Angeles feels safer with him guarding the streets and clearing them of the depraved.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have read quite a few of Nelson DeMille's books and I would have to say that this book is not as interesting or cleaver as some of his other books.  You might want to read it to get a view of life in Yeman, as it goes into great detail about Yeman.
1593272790|4.0|I'm not disappointed with the book, but please keep in mind, this is an idea book only, not a step by step instruction guide.<br /><br />You'll need to use your powers of observation to figure out which parts are needed and how to put the item together.  If you prefer to be led by the hand when putting together a LEGO model, then skip this book, otherwise it is worth the money.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|A very cool show.  Excellent story line and well written.  And you gotta love Daryl's bike! Andrew Lincoln plays the lead character so well.  Going from rational to the brink of madness and getting pulled back to rational.
B004H4XLRE|4.0|Great product and easy to use for little hands and fun for parents too. Our 2 1/2 year old can move the levers and launch the cars by himself. There are flags and car numbers above each slot in the case to indicate which race car should be in each area.  Helps with numbers and flags/countries for each of the race cars as well. Small and light enough that even with 10 cars it's easy for young ones to carry. Best for use on hard surface/wood floors, but works on carpet as well. There are two launchers - 5 cars at a time on the left and right side of the case. It can be played with two people (one launch button for each set of 5) or your child can launch all 10 at the same time by themselves. Good for enhancing coordination and organization skills as well colors and numbers - which car is the 1st, 2nd ... 10th. Great price and easy fun.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Following in the footsteps of the season one set, HBO delivers another perfect blu-ray box set. This blu-ray set is a must for any serious game of thrones fan. The quality here is top notch on both video and audio, one of the best blu-ray experiences I've had so far. Loaded with special features, and includes even more extras than season 1 offered. This set includes a DVD set, digital copies and more. I got this at a great preorder price of 35$ at the time, although I see it has gone up since then. It is still worth the price for what you receive. Can't wait until Season 3 is on bluray as well.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This show has me hooked from the first shot to the last of each episode.  The main characters are incredibly complex and the show explores the concept of evil on many levels.  The scary part?  Thinking that the plotline could actually happen in our society.
0486278077|5.0|I like to read classics every now and then.  The ones from the Victorian era tend to bog me down with their loquacious descriptions and fluff.  I digress, but my favorite book of all time remains Don Quixote, because though it was written in the 1600's, it reads like it was written last year.  But back to Dorian Gray.  While portions of this book slogged along in typical Victorian style, overall it was excellent.<br /><br />What really struck me about the book is how much the central theme of vanity, beauty, and the shallow pursuit of pleasure at all costs is paralleled in our current society.  Dorian Gray is horrified at the notion that he will age while the gorgeous portrait of him will stay perfect.  Meanwhile, his close friend waxes on an on about how youth and beauty are the only true virtues in life.  Sounds like about 90% of the people in our entertainment industry.  I got the sense much of this book is satire, and as such found it pretty amusing.  And like all the classics that have lasted the test of time, The Picture of Dorian Grey is infinitely deeper in it's message than most popular fiction you'll find.<br /><br />The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fairly quick read for this era, and I found the ending entirely satisfying.  I'd recommend reading it, and maybe have your teenagers read it too.
6304698623|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a 9 year old girl and she was ecstatic!! Great for young girls.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I became interested in Imagine Dragons after hearing their single, &#34;It's Time,&#34; and decided to try out their whole album--totally worth it!  The other songs are also great.  I'd recommend getting the deluxe version, since it contains two additional tracks (&#34;Working Man&#34; and &#34;Fallen&#34;), both of which are just as enjoyable as the rest of the album.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|On the kindle fire hd you will have to uninstall the old version to get the update to install.  Goto more, applications and then installed applications and choose uninstall.  Fore some reason the update wont work so you have to do it this way.  Your settings will remain intact when you do it.
B002ZG98G4|4.0|I would recommend this movie.  Rachel McAdams is as wonderful as ever, and her character in this film has an especially fun/quirky personality.  Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton also do a great job.  There's fun music, an inspiring storyline, and plenty of humor....my kind of movie!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Definitely a page turner. Really fun, quick read. Great for young adults & teens - or anyone who liked the davinci code.
B004QIG7CW|3.0|While this movie was fairly enjoyable, I felt a little silly after buying it.  I had read reviews by adults saying they liked it just as much as their kids, or by college-age reviewers who also really enjoyed the movie, so I took the leap and purchased it.  It was fun, but not THAT fun, and definitely predictable and kid-oriented.  The two best songs are Determinate and She's So Gone--I'd recommend just watching those clips from the movie on youtube, unless you're getting this for your school-age kids (ages 10-16ish), who would probably would enjoy the movie enough to warrant renting or buying the film.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This book is more than a hiking book.  It's about facing your demons, fears and grief...to be lost and searching to find yourself and peace.  I found it an enchanting read....both humorous, touching, hopeful and nerve wracking.  Great adventure, great people met along the way..all entwined with both lovely and painful memories of her life.  You can't help but to cheer the author on...to lend her your encouragement to keep going.  Enjoy!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie is a good example of the human spirit triumphing over all odds and the value of being kind. There is a surprise twist to the ending that I really liked. I would recommend this movie to anyone.

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The story line is great and the characters work well together.  I love how they interact with each other.  Can wait for season two.

B005LAII80|5.0|...but like many things that seem simple on the surface, there is more lurking beneath.<br /><br />Dredd this time around is much more closely aligned with the comic. Not a remake but a re-imagining, Dredd captures the greatness of 80's action movies while retaining relevance to current events. Science fiction serves to reflect modern times through a warped mirror and Dredd does so with brilliance.<br /><br />The camera-work is outstanding, maintaining a gritty over-the-shoulder view during certain shootouts, while never taking itself too seriously. The acting is solid and the plotting tense. The characters feel human and we see through their facades to the weariness and fear beneath.<br /><br />Excellent film shot in sane 3D. Well worth the time for fans of the genre.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I had viewed the first two seasons of the show & fell in love with it. Could not view this past season, so ordered the DVD. It was wonderful, as I had expected. Can`t wait for next season.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Characters are bright and full.  It feels like I know them and miss them when the episode is over..A must see....
B000002LEM|2.0|only one good song &#34;finish what you started&#34;...rest is junk rock!! Haggar does well but song quality is very poor!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like this game I liked playing the real game(the one in gas stations) but I never won with that one I win with this one you almost win
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|This show was a VERY pleasant surprise. I wish I would have given the time to watch it back when it was on air, so they could have possibly made more episodes. It draws heavily from the first 2 movies which is great. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the show. Summer Glau is a great and very talented actress and she pulled off Cameron great!!! The cast was wonderful and the story was fantastically written. Great stuff!!!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Awesome movie as expected......great story and very good acting on by all involved.  And hey....its Batman so watch it anyways.
B00AF46Q5Y|5.0|My husband and I have read all Jeffrey Archer and so glad for his new series. Can't wait to continue the saga.

B002RXHW6S|5.0|This was a purchase for our church daycare. It's easy to set up, easy to store, and the kids love it.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I was going back and forth between this one and the i7 version for an upgrade to my gaming rig.  I ended up going with this one based off of the fact it was cheaper and I'm not planning on needing the hyper threading that comes with the i7.  All I can say is WOW what an upgrade from the old Q6600 quad core I had.  Before I was using a lot of my CPU and not under heavy load I am only using at most 50% of any core at any given time, mostly averaging 30%-40% use.  Applications that use to take several seconds to open or load are now instantaneous.  Overall I'm very happy with this processor so if you are looking to upgrade a gaming rig you can't go wrong with this thing.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Awesome album.  A really talented American Idol artist.  Philip Phillips shows real talent and is a real musician.  I love how his sound is similar to Dave Matthews.
B004BFPDQQ|5.0|Love the CD's!!  I love Eric Clapton and these CD's satisfied were great the BluRay was awesome - made my day!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Awesome album.  I love the band sound and the musicality!  A really good purchase and a great listen.  Really recommend this.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this series I can't put into words ... I've read it 3 times and it never gets old ..along with the Crossfire novels this series is one of the best erotic love stories ... Lets just say I wouldn't read this book if I didn't have a boyfriend laying around after I was finished with a chapter !!
0875428940|5.0|I consider the Robin Wood Tarot deck to be one of my 2 go-to decks in my collection.  I collect the other decks for their art, but Robin Wood's easy to interpret images make the readings I do pop and stay in my client's mind.
0007447868|5.0|I have no clue why this book is getting bad reviews.  It's awesome, and I find it to be on par with the first three.  The stories are all tying themselves together and it's enjoyable.  At least to me, but to each their own I suppose.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I'm almost done with this book and will finish it to the end.  For me, that means it was enjoyable or I wouldn't make it to the end.  I recommend this book.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|SO, where do I begin?  What are Uglies?  They are normal people... what????  Yes normal people are considered uglies until they have an operation when they turn 16 that turns them all beautiful.  They are warded off to live with other uglies until the operation and then once the operation hits they move to New Pretty Town and party all the time.<br /><br />Tally is the heroine whom the story revolves around and she is an ugly almost 16.  She befriends Shay who tells her of a place where you don't have to be beautiful, you can stay ugly.  Tally wants to have the operation and go see her old best friend Peris and party until sunrise.  She does NOT want to be ugly.  She and Shay pull pranks and become fast friends.  Shay tells her of the Smoke where the \\"rebel\\" people live.  These are just normal uglies who did not have the operation.  Tally can't imagine anything as awful as this so she lets Shay go on her own...<br /><br />Too bad she didn't realize the consequences of letting Shay go to the Smoke and staying behind so she can become Pretty.  All I will say is that her punishment for not giving up Shay is an ugly one.<br /><br />I wont give anything away, it's definitely a new spin on a typical Dystopian novel.  The world that Scott Westerfeld has built between the New Pretty Town, The Smoke, Ugly City, Special Circumstances, The Rusties, all of the inventions we use today and the new ones of the future is absolutely stunning.  I can imagine this in a film with beautiful cinematography.  There's a huge twist at the end which makes me desperate to see what happens in book 2 Pretties.  Definitely a well thought out book and concept with a great spin that will leave your imagination to go run wild!

Nebraska was the BEST filmed, written, and acted SHOWDOWN (in every sense, especially in the Old Western Classic Gunfight sense) I've ever seen. TENSE, BABY. And include the EXCELLENT MUSIC (The Regulator.... by Clutch) and you have a CLASSIC.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My DVD arrived within the specified time.  I needn't have worried, it was compatible with Australia region.  Downton Abbey is a fantastic series and I have bought all 3 from Amazon.  Fingers crossed for a 4th series.
0061474355|5.0|WOW! I've seen the books in this trilogy at the used book store. I've picked them up many times... and set them back down. Then I read (and loved) Garth Nix's Confusion of Princes so I decided to check these out.<br /><br />Sabriel is an epic high fantasy, set in a world that is literally on the borders. The story revolves around the border between life and death. Sabriel is a necromancer, but not just any necromancer. She and her father, Abhorsen, are sworn to bind the death in Death. They often have to travel into Death themselves to do this. The story is set on another important border - between a realm of magic and that of ordinary (1920's ish) society. Both borders have been in a perpetual state of unrest for the last 20 years. The Dead aren't staying dead and scary Free Magics are creeping across The Wall into the rest of the world. Now Sabriel's father is trapped in death... or actually dead? She must find him and save the kingdom from a terrible enemy set on releasing all of the Dead and taking power for himself.<br /><br />Sure. This sounds like your typical high fantasy, girl-on-a-quest-to-save-the-world novel. I thought so too. But Garth Nix weaves a story like no other. The setting is both beautiful and eerie. The magic is simple, but powerful. And the villains are really really scary. Sabriel is a hero worth believing in. She never whines or hands over the reigns to her male companion. Garth Nix knows how to write strong female protagonists. Count this book a new favorite.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I picked up this book after seeing the movie. Frankly I didn't expect much. However this book changed me although some parts can appear tedious it is a masterpiece.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I'm the kind of person who keeps detailed notes on everything.Virtual notebooks take up less space and are harder to lose and I love the choice of different covers as I am also a color coder,lol
B003JTHXOK|4.0|At first I didn't get into it, but I kept reading. I'm so glad I did ,this book was amazing and the movie was really good too, even though there was some differences.
B000V8A31C|5.0|This album is just incredible!  I bought it a few years ago and haven't stop listening to it since.  I strongly recommend it!
B0086700CM|5.0|Ok so temple run is way to addicting to me I played for 2days in a row it is not healthy at all but I still play it just not so many days please don't make it the same mistake I did but I have to admit it is definitely a five star game great job temple run creators you really did get one of the best games in the world keep making new ones
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|My family loves all of Tolkiens movies. We couldn't wait for this one to come out and the countdown has started for part 2.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I find this game fun and enjoyable. I like that's it's not super hard but still requires quick thinking. My 4 year-old loves to play. I recommend this if u are looking for an all ages game.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Read the first 4 in the bundle and I bought this after I finished<br /><br />SOS, because it ties in very well with FFC which by itself makes for a less interesting read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so awesome I just want to play it all the time.If you liked temple run you are going to love this game.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Well it's good but not as good as minecraft pocket edition. It's pretty much the same as temple run two
B007REV4YI|5.0|If you are like me you will enjoy this movie. I have never found a 007 movie that I didn't enjoy... Daniel Craig makes a great James Bond, of course I think all of the &#34;James Bond's&#34; were great... but that's just me.<br /><br />Have you ever (during a really intense scene) said to yourself, I wish it would slow down just a bit? Well, I thing this 007 movie does just that, slow down just a bit. But as every Bond movie has done before this one, been better than the one preceding, this 007 is no different. They keep getting better and better.<br /><br />If you're not a fan of MI6, well... this Movie will make you one. You have to see it in Blu-ray, wow!
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|Very political, but I still could not put it down. I was glad that justice ruled finally in the end
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|What a letdown, and thank goodness I did not go to the theater to see this movie. I am an avid reader of the times of the Presidency of Lincoln.  Basically this is all about slavery and nothing else.  Very little about the war and the pain of the war.  Very little about Lincoln, only about the passing of the 13th Amendment. Another movie for black America, yet it is unusual that no one realizes that it was Republican that sacrificed for the freedom of slavery.  You can see the Democrats would dead set against the freedom of slaves.  But I guess the viewer will never get that message.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Democrats have done everything to destroy the Black family, if you know anything about history.  Many make comparison to Obama to be like Lincoln.  Yet Lincoln did everything in his power to keep the country together, and Obama does everything he came to bring it down.  Lincoln was a man of vision and strength and I guess the movie did show that, well a very small part of it.  Any commander fells pain for the loss of his men.  I can see in the movie the pain in Lincoln in the loss of so many people.  It is interesting how many a President without military experience have put so many men in harms way.  If Lincoln had any real previous military experience, he might have been able to see a good military commander and not put so many bad commanders in power that killed so many troops on both sides.  It took years for Lincoln to pick Grant, because he won so many battle.  Grant was a man of vision in battle.<br /><br />The only part of the movie that moved me was the ending where there was a re-creation of the ending of the surrender of Lee.<br /><br />Spielberg picked the wrong book, I have no idea the message he was conveying.  It was lost on me.
B00A429YF6|5.0|This was my first time seeing the movie.  I've heard about the movie before & visited the Bagdad Cafe a few times on our way to Laughlin. Our most recent visit, I ate a delicious burger, fries & a pretty decent cup of coffee. It was cold & windy that day. We talked w/the very interesting & friendly locals of the area, owner/staff as well. Very cool people. Anyway, I bought the movie prior to our trip to the desert. We stayed in Ludlow at the Ludlow Motel & that evening I watched the movie. Great movie, especially since I know the history of that area. You have have to go there, the Bagdad Cafe. Friendly people, interesting characters & even the dogs are friendly ... it was like a perfect movie set w/o the movie stuff!
0596806027|1.0|I know html and xhtml, yet I was looking for construction of development with the new tags.  I wanted to see how they use the new structure tags and nothing is explained except for how to use javascript with html5.  The box only discussed how javascript is used with the new media capability.<br /><br />This book is crap, I found a css3 book with a much better explanation and using the new structure tags, i.e <nav>, <section>.  Thank God I got coffee cup software, at least that has showed me examples.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|its a good app to have I'm always using it for math and other stuff ! I like cuz its easy to use
B00AFROVQC|1.0|One of the worst books I have ever read, or maybe I should say, started to read. I managed to make it through 9 chapters, hoping that it would get better, that with so many good reviews it just had to get better... Wrong! It's like the author had a checklist of every fantasy fiction cliché, that they just ticked off as quick as they could . No character development, blatantly obvious what comes next etc etc.<br />Young boy wants glory, discovers magic, becomes hero, meets hot princess, they fall in love.. This is fairly standard plot lines in so many books, but most of them at least make the hero &#34;work for it&#34;, with this book everything falls into his lap like some teenage boy's wet dream.<br />So many seriously corny lines it is just cringeworthy. I could go on for pages about how badly this book should be avoided, save yourself the pain and embarrassment...
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Loved the movie. I streamed it via ROKU, and the quality and sound was stunning. I would watch it again.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This has great idea, but the limited revives stinks. Overall,this games is very,very, very, very, very, very, cool<br />Also a great concept
1423101499|4.0|I bought this book as a gift and the little boy really enjoyed this book! I would definitely consider buying more within the series!
B0009A40ES|5.0|This movie is a wonderful satire on consumer excess, and the illusion of &#34;having it all&#34;.  I can't wait to read the book.  Christian Bale is chillingly terrifying in the lead role.  Superb acting!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. it had a great story line and had funny parts too. I would recommend this movie. G
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a really fun game, so fun that I think that ipad owners should check the app store and try to find it. I have owned it for less than half an hour and I've already unlocked the second chapter.<br /><br />Freddie age 6
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the greatest game in the world because you get hover boards and it is just the coolest game i have ever played
0061743526|5.0|I loaned my copy of To Kill a Mockingbird to a friends several years ago, and she lost it. It is my favorite book of all time. I have been looking for a hardback version for years. Great price too!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This game is a definite improvement on Pandemic, the flash game. The best concept is already pretty solid, and this version executes some stuff well.<br /><br />Perhaps my biggest problem is that, although the game looks like it presents you with a diversity of strategies, it seems to me that this is really a game about timing and tempo. You have to use all three types of mutations, transmissions, abilities, and symptoms. You pretty much have to grab the drug resistance mutation, as well as the research slowing one. Plus, there are specific symptoms that are pretty much strictly better than the rest, and there aren't as many different progressions you can use. The gene customization helps somewhat in letting you craft strategies, but there are a few genes that are pretty busted, the devolving bonus one at lower difficulties and the symptom cost capping one at higher difficulties.<br /><br />The real complexity of the game is not in what you choose to grab, but when. If you stay low for too long, that is, just focus on transmissions, you can be too broke to get lethal enough when they get wise. But if you up the severity too much too early, you just get squashed. The random in game events and the random mutations are really what make the gameplay different from game to game, especially on brutal. I liked the different types of plagues, though some of them were kind of boring.<br /><br />The zombie add-on is the most complex and interesting part, I think. Beating it on brutal requires a very precise timing and sequence of mutations.<br /><br />All in all, the game does have depth, but sometimes it felt like I was playing just to unlock everything, not because it was always that fun. Personally, I think the game developers need to put more effort into allowing different strategies, because I felt railroaded in playing this game a lot.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I like the game it has good concept art and just enough puzzles to get your brain working. Others are saying it didn't say you had to pay but it does, SO QUIT YOUR COMPLAINING!!!!!!!!
B004UNX1LS|2.0|As several others have mentioned, this crashes a lot on my kindle hd, though not while I'm actually watching the video, just when I'm searching. It's good when it works, the ads aren't that annoying.
B008VBYN80|5.0|In order to reap the benefits of &quot;free&quot; games such as these, you must be patient. I haven't spent a cent on this particular game yet. And as of today I am level 34. Can I move as quickly as others? No, but that's because I am doing this the &quot;free&quot; way. I assure you, you can enjoy this game IF you can manage to take a deep breath. Be Calm and Game On.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|interesting story. interesting way of telling that story. it made me feel convicted to be more forgiving. form your own opinion.
B004L03B3S|5.0|This is a story about two brothers who have loved each other since childhood...and who's relationship continues to grow...as they become adults.  This is not a story for kids as it deals with the feelings the two boys share together...both as kids and young adults.  The subject matter may be a bit controversial but the story line is powerful....and the actiing is so good from all the principal characters...that one doesn't see the negative aspects of the relationship...one only sees two brothers who care for and love each other.  At one point, they are separated as the younger brother goes away but upon return, they are reunited and one feels they will never again separate from each other.  This is an excellent movie...well done...well acted.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|Paired this APU with MSI FM2-A75MA-E35 motherboard and G.SKILL 8GB of DDR3 F3-12800CL9D-8GBSR2.<br /><br />What you getting is not a super computer but a budget computer that is suitable for typical workstation and HTPC.<br /><br />This computer is connected to two monitors, one 19' LCD via VGA and a 39' LCD television via HDMI.  The APU is able support dual monitors configuration with no issue.
6305897786|5.0|This is an excellent movie...with fine perfomances by the entire cast.  Great plot...it will keep you interested from start to finish. The movie is about the search for a book that the devil himself wrote...where only 3 copies are known to be in existence.  Johnny Depp is awesome in a role he tackles so well. He's hired to track down the books...and the characters he has to deal with along the way...form the bulk of the storyline.  Highly recommended!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|It's eBay and it works as it should on my Kindle. Not much more to say about it. It's AWESOME!!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Great book with the perfect ending. If you've read the other 2, you won't be disappointed with how this one turns out
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love The Big Bang Theory. It is honestly one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. Humorous and witty. 5 Stars for sure!
B009NYF2ES|5.0|Amazing improvement over the older DVD release. If you love the film you can't do better than this. You won't be sorry.
0425238091|3.0|I'm in the minority. The book has sold hugely. I understand the crisis in health care and am very concerned about it. I am for a single payer plan.  If I were an intern, resident, I might find the book amusing. As a patient, and a recent one at that, in addition to now being older, I found it disturbing.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|They still make beautiful music. They really deserve all the 5 stars. Will recommend it to the younger generation to listen to how true songs are composed.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I had some trouble navigating but overall it's okay.  Actually saved a picture, but I am not exactly sure what I did.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I gave the Walking Dead 5 stars because there is absolutely no reason for a lessor rating! Seriously one of the best out there anywhere! Good Job AMC!
B0063M22QO|2.0|I purchased Mahjong for my Kindle Fire and really do not like it.  The tiles are too small and the patterns very complicated for the size of the tiles.  There is no way to enlarge them.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|We all loved this movie, from ages 5 to 43.  It was fun to watch and with a touch of adventure and a bit of wonder thrown in in to make you think.
B0063GORYU|4.0|The game plays just like the computer edition.  Easy to use.  Wish I could enlarge the cards.  Good distraction at times.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great way to waste time. Fun and challenging. very addictive. A lot like bejeweled, no need to purchase at any point in gsmeplay.
B00632HWOG|4.0|The mail is listed with the first part of the message.  Attachments like photos are easy to open and download.
B004JMZPJG|4.0|Normally, I take my ThinkTank Urban Disguise 60 V2.0 when I go away on business because it can hold my SLR, a bunch of lenses, some paperwork and my laptop, but when I go away for pleasure I really don't need much more than my SLR with 17-50mm lens, spare battery, charger and a few SD cards.<br /><br />This case securely fit my Sony A57 with Tamron SP 17-50mm lens, ThinkTank Camera Strap and 2 packets of silica desiccant in the main compartment. I was able to fit a cushy SanDisk SD card wallet (1.5&#34; x 1.5&#34;) with 2 spare SD cards in their plastic case in the zippered pocket located inside the case on the flap. The one outside zippered compartment housed my spare battery and charger and the other was home to some Zeiss lens wipes and spare lens caps.<br /><br />I believe this case will do a very good job protecting your gear from the occasional bumps of everyday life, but I am not sure it would keep anything from breaking if the case were to fall off your shoulder and land on concrete or other hard surface. There just isn't that much padding on the bottom.<br /><br />Overall, this case is perfect when you don't want to lug all your gear.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Easy to follow your friends on the go.  The Kindle Fire screen makes it much more enjoyable than on the iphone.
B000067QMD|5.0|I have three Avent bottles but sealing discs didn't come with them.  These are great and serve my needs well to be able to have a bottle that will travel well.
B007BZM3HK|4.0|Call Me Maybe:  Its a song, I liked it so I bought it.  It downloaded fine. What more can I say???
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|The new album for Spock's Beard surely delivers.  Stepping up to the plate as Spock's new lead singer is Ted Leonard (Enchant, Xen, Thought Chamber, Affector) and this might cause some concern for fans as Ted's voice is totally different than Neal's and Nick's.  But, from what I've heard and I've listened to it already several times (as I had pre-ordered it from their website and it arrived way before the scheduled release date) this album definitely rocks.  While it might change direction to a degreee I might say this is one of their best releases to date.  While I still consider 'V' their best release overall I believe Ted does justice to the songs and each song is well thought out and delivered.  One long song on the album, 'Waiting For Me' clocking in at around 12 minutes, but nothing here on this release as a multiple part song.  Ted throws in a little spirtiual influence with the first track 'Hiding Out' and the band redoes his track 'Submerged' from his 2007 solo release.  Overall, if you love Spock's Beard, but love Ted's voice from listening to Enchant you will not be disappointed here.  Great album for 2013 and well worth the wait.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it I wish that I could save episodes for a while season and then watch them all at once.I just don't have the patience. It's something my son and I can agree on any day of the week
B00BGI08GG|5.0|Ive always been a green arrow fan and I was totally excited when the show came out, its been amazing, though I hope the price comes down when the dvds come out, 60 is pretty high!
B0059XTUEK|5.0|I loved the story and Michelle Williams is spectacular. I am very critical of actresses who portray Marilyn and Williams does such a great job that you almost forget it's not really Marilyn.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I was ready to give this four stars and recommend it to all my friends, but I was so disappointed by the ending.  It was a huge anticlimax that was neither here nor there.  Very disappointing.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Slow read but very much worth sticking with it til the end. I would definitely recommend it as a good book club read and also to friends and family.
1401937268|5.0|i used the rider tarot but i always thought that was a very negative cards, i found the angel tarot cards (i work with angels and i love doreen virtue) and im not regret, actually i use this one more often than the rider tarot. i highly recomend this deck.
B0002ZMIU8|5.0|Damn I love this movie.  It has a million quotable lines and yeah it's immature as hell that's what makes it awesome because it's immature in a really clever way.  Bonus points for referring to Beyonce as &#34;the one from Destiny's Child with the big thighs.&#34;
B006WQLH7G|1.0|it started out great but then started blocking web sites like wikipedia saying it had 'malicious content'. same of other web sites and no way of disabling it.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This was good to watch to be reminded just how easy we Americans have it.  Yes this took place back during WWII but even then we Americans had it so easy compared to Europe.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game ever created to me I love this game o wish the challenges were more words .... I loved the Easter egg hunt it was lovely
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An excellent book which I can recommend without reservation. If you have a heart and understand just how ruthless life can often be, you will be enthralled by this tale. Love and sacrifice, terror and despair, all endured in a game of horror which is devised to shatter everything that is good in the human spirit. However, the Game planners forgot one simple fact. Tools which are designed to destroy, can also be used to temper steel.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This is a great follow up to  the Pillars of the Earth.  I was unaware that there was a sequel until I saw it on Amazon.  It's a lengthy book but just my cup of tea
B00C4QVQV0|5.0|This show has great action without sacrificing well developed characters and a increasingly great script.  This show has an brilliant human element to it that is unparalleled.  If you do not watch this show, you should seriously consider all choices you have made in your life to decide whether or not you are who you think you are.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I found myself at times sad & other times chuckling at the characters.  Good read .<br />The book describes how Catholic orphanages operated into the 1990's
B0009P5YXO|5.0|It still works well, and it has the bells and whistles compared to a simpler model we bought from a local store.
B004BSFC6Y|2.0|The socks don't have any elasticity in them... at all.  So when she kicks her feet they just fly off her feet.  Also, the rattle noise could be louder to get baby's attention a little better.  Wish I hadn't bought them.
B003TNM2K6|5.0|This is an intense movie. I could see people upset at the ending - but this is a stephen king movie!
B004BSFC46|3.0|They fit my daughters wrists great, and they are super cute.  But they are not very loud!  They function more as funny bracelets than wrist rattles.
B006QS0PF0|5.0|Wonderful book by a wonderful person! Couldn't put this book down! Would love for Portia to write more! Inspiration for not giving up!
B0013TTLDE|3.0|I generally liked the book as a period piece, but thought the plot was contrived and I did not feel for the characters, especially Hannah.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I play this game with my two year old grandson,  he loves when they build their houses. would like to have a variety of boards.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|Real Rock n' Roll Band !!<br />40 years together and still making good music, love this new album , stop readin' this and buy your copy!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Amazing that even after more than 40 years there is still music from the master that hasn't been released yet. Great cd, love it from beginning till end.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Good movie, however, I am used to James Bond having all these gadgets, cars, etc. that make the film exciting.  It had a tracking device... big deal, so does my cell phone.  Rather slow film at times and not the best of James Bond.<br /><br />On another note, I had the film stop and start three times.  Each time the words kept going but the film stopped.  Amazon made this right with me so no complaints.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|awesome movies, I had been meaning to find a box set of them so when I got an email about this set on sale I jumped on it.  works great still love the movies
B009X01C64|5.0|It is really versatile in the positions you can turn it. Pretty much whichever way you want, it can do. Great for laying in bed and it comfortably sits on your chest while reading or watching shows.
B008P9M614|5.0|i had a couple of the seasons by themselves, but i got this on sale.  so much cheaper this way and takes up less room on my movie shelf.
0743270754|5.0|After seeing 'Lincoln&#34;  I wanted the book it was based on.<br /><br />Movies hit the high points and I wanted to learn more.  I am working my way through the book in anticipation of a trip to  Gettysburg.
B00164EAC8|4.0|it's insane how much picture difference there is between vhs and bluray.  but of course since there is no more vcr in my house gotta replace all the vhs tapes.
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|Sacrifice is truly a great piece of music by one of the greatest metal bands<br />ever. Thanks guys for all the goodness.......<br /><br />  Im one of the biggest Saxon fans on the planet. I love everything that they have ever done everything ! and I have them all. I love the fullness of this band and there arent many dual guitar bands that do it the way these guys have. They feature two of the best ever in the business. While Saxon maybe pushed and had a hard time with Call To Arms, they have more than made up for it with Sacrifice !<br /><br />  I wondered if Saxon would ever put out a new album again. Im really thankfull that they did and they put this kind of power and goodness into it. Saxon in my opinion have never gotten the kind of respect that they truly deserve, given I know that there are diehard fans just like me out there who believes that they have carried the banner for 80s old school metal for all these years.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|I got it at a great price, worked out well because I was replacing my DVD copies with Bluray so that my nephew could have the DVD.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|I mean it's like the most fun game ever, but I have a problem. It only gives you like 30 seconds to race and you keep having to get time things but sometimes there not always around so buoyant play the rest of the game I really wish it would give you endless time.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Great Game For A Quick Mind Break.Amazing Graphics And replay ability. I Would Recommend This game For All Ages. Kids And Adults Can Compete For The High Score
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I ordered this movie because it is one of my absolute favorites. It arrived right on time, intact, and the disc was good. No scratches or marks of any kind!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|A must-see for any age, this has to be one of the best animated films ever made. Alec Baldwin as Santa is an added bonus.
B008MM9630|3.0|keeps restarting. but very fun. easy game with easy quests. and no nieghbors to depend on. please fix bug very annoying
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This is another good CD. Anything done by Josh Groban is very enjoyable. The sound of his voice is soothing.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Enjoyed the whole thing. Read the book first and liked both a lot. Pattinson and Ricci were great too. Totally recommend.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|The season has been entertaining. The creators have good imaginations to be able to come up with such a variety of story lines.
B007REV4YI|1.0|This brand new disc came in a Blu-ray package, but the inside is just a DVD+Digital Copy. There is no Blu-ray disc inside.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great show for all ages, we watched it as a family and all have enjoyed it. Kids are all teens or older
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I can only say this product does give a great indication as to how much battery life is left on my kindle.
1616550414|5.0|Guys, this book is really amazing. All the images, all the texts, all the content. I love it. Perfect and nothing more.
B004GYY714|5.0|I like a lot of AM Radio.  This helps me do just that.  It is a great program.  Simple and easy to use.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|I liked it because I'm a cat lover. If you are a cat lover like me, I would recommend it to you.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|this is a fun bingo game. it is a great time killer. i didn't think it was going to be this much fun.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|I am be a bit bias because Killswitch Engage is my favorite band, but this album is awesome. I am not much on reviews but I will do the best I can. I love the extreme heavy songs on the albums, especially the opening track \\"the hell in me\\". When I listen to this album, I hear classic KSE from the howard era (before the 2nd self titled album) and hear classic KSE from the original Jesse era. So fans of both vocalist will love this album. The one thing that that stood out was the instrumental work on this album. They had amazing guitar with GUITAR SOLOS and had unheard drum beats.<br /><br />If I had to pick my 4 favorite tracks, they are \\"The Hell In Me\\", \\"The Call\\", \\"Beyond The Flames\\" and \\"A Tribute To The Fallen\\"
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This charger does exactly what it is supposed to. It looks sleek and charges my tablet in half the time as the factory issued charger whether I am playing on it or not. It is sleek looking and not something that I am ashamed to have in my home. I would recommend this product for anyone owning a kindle fire that wants the great preformance in half the time.
B007X2JV0S|5.0|If getting the soundtracks just to listen to certain familiar tunes, then the first series may be preferable. However, if you are listening to the albums from start to finish, the second (this one) is much smoother in transitions and more engaging and dynamic in its sentiment.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|It was a good read, for my second time reading. I read it as a senior in high school, there were alot of things I forgot.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Awesome story, great movie.  This movie is about more than just chasing a big wave.  Frosty teaches important life lessons and helps a young man grow into an adult.
B000003TAR|5.0|Nirvana was too over hyped about Nevermind for In Utero to get much recognition but it deserves that and more for its darker and more thoughtful tone.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|Top Gun is party of movie history, its a film you know the quotes, the characters, the music (which is just Danger Zone and Take My Breath Away).  I have never seen the entire film just bits and pieces and over the years such as the bar scene, the volleyball scene, the shirtless arguments between Kilmer and Cruise.  I must say I was critical of this film before every watching it thinking it was some ridiculous movie from the 80's.  We received this as a wedding gift and it was also the first film we watched on our 3D TV.  I was truly entertained, the 3D effects look terrific.  The plane scenes looked great however what really worked with the 3D was that the scenes with just the actors were not jarring in 3D, the effects didn't distract me from the performance of the actors.  I highly recommend this film, even without the 3D effects it would still be a highly entertaining film.  The whole cast does a wonderful job, Tom Cruise was really charismatic back in the day. Great lines, great scenes and good music, even though it basically goes back and forth between two songs.  The only complaint I have against the film is the third act seems like it was thrown together, the ending is just too quick.  Graduate from Top Gun, within five minutes they are off on their first mission.  Maybe it was getting to long and they had to make some drastic cuts.  Overall, fantastic film, I highly recommend the 3D version, either way you watch it, its an extremely entertaining film.

B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Argo begins with a comic-book style sequence imparting the basics of modern Iranian history.  I was pretty impressed, because if there is one thing I've learned from FLCL, comic-book style sequences are hard to animate.<br /><br />The Argo leaps into a riveting sequence, when a mob of students breaks into the US Embassy in Tehran - and six employees in a side building manage to escape the hostage situation.  They find refuge with the Canadian ambassador and the CIA decides extracting them isn't a priority.  Then the situation changes.  And no one has a clue how to get them out.  Their best idea?  Create a fake movie and say the six are a film crew scouting locations.<br /><br />Argo does a good job of keeping the tension high, but not so high that the movie is a pain to watch.  There are spots to breathe.  Even before Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) goes to Hollywood, there's humor in the scene where the State Department presents their ideas for extraction to the CIA.  But the majority of the humor does come from the Hollywood scenes.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed how Argo used period music.  Films set in the seventies tend to go for the same songs.  It's a storytelling crutch nowadays.  Those recognizable bits of classic rock are there, but they tend to punctuate a scene instead of playing out over an action montage.  Late in the movie one song is allowed to play on, and I'm not sure whether I like it or not.  The song is perfect for the scene, but the lyrics are so on the nose that it's hard not to feel like you're being nudged with the clue hammer.<br /><br />I find the real story behind Argo fascinating.  I knew about the Iranian Hostage Crisis from school - and my mom from being alive in 1979 - but I'd never heard about the six.  I enjoyed reading up on the situation and finding out what was real and what was invented to make the movie more dramatic.  Honestly, I think the movie could've dialed back on the invention a hair and been even better.  Many of the added bits stuck out as artificial, messing with the movie's realistic tone.<br /><br />I liked Argo because it's a fascinating story and it was told with style, humor, and urgency.  I can't say whether it deserved to win the statue since I haven't seen many of its competitors yet, but I don't think it's a film someone would regret watching.  And it's kind of sad that the Argo cover film was never to be because it sounds like something I would love.bits stuck out as artificial, messing with the movie's realistic tone.<br /><br />I liked Argo because it's a fascinating story and it was told with style, humor, and urgency.

I love the show, and think that it is one of the most interesting in terms of story telling and flow in terms of tv shows that are on today. It takes the tales we all know and love and puts them together for a wild ride. I give season 2 five stars.

B003UBTX7C|4.0|I have read all of David Baldacci's Oliver Stone series.  Hell's Corner had more twists and turns than the others but I thought it was just a little too long and convoluted.  I was getting nervous because, at one time in the plot, I thought the Camel Club would be no more.  I was glad to see that this was not the case.

1416596585|4.0|If you're even the least bit interested in Google, this book is a must read. It highlights how Google works, what it thinks, why it's changing, how it will continue to change, and most importantly, how it hopes to maintain its soul. This book has everything you need to know about Google from a brief background of its founders to an extensive overview of all of its offerings. Some of the service and product descriptions can get a little technical, but for the most part, the author does a good job of keeping the book interesting by peppering each chapter with anecdotes from Googlers inside and outside of the organization. This book gives you an insider perspective on the organization and its founders. It's absolutely fascinating to see how Google has grown from a graduate school dissertation into one of the most successful companies of all time.

B00AGKH7K0|3.0|The man's been around awhile. I do like his voice and it's loosened up a bit with age, sort of how Joe Cocker's voice has done. I didn't give this a very high rating beacuse I don't care much for the lyrics on the disc. Seemed like his voice was wasted somehow on the songs he chose. He can sing a ballad better than most and can really sing the blues. I wish he'd done more of that on this CD.

I made myself a flow chart of who was  who and who lived where but it was still beyond cumbersome to keep track of them.  I would have enjoyed this soooo much more with fewer characters and logistics that were easier to follow.

1612680011|5.0|In his book, Robert Kiyosaki outlines a paradigm that I believe the bulk of us fall within, which is the mindset of working hard to get a good paying job. He offers a different way to direct our efforts in order to benefit us the most. He tells the story of 2 dads he had as a child: one who was highly educated and had a good secure job, and another who was less formally educated, but later became a very wealthy man.<br /><br />Kiyosaki talks about the biggest lessons he learned from his rich dad and how they opposed the things he was being taught from his educated dad. At the heart of the 6 lessons he reviews is the lesson that our minds and our time are the greatest assets given to us, and most people waste their talents working for companies with great benefits for the sake of \\"security.\\" They feel undervalued and their highly specialized skills have limited their options. They create a lifestyle that makes them even more dependent on their paychecks, full of a large mortgage and payments for new cars. Their lifestyles lock them into even less options and they become slaves to their work, always chasing the illusion of a pay raise or a big break that will solve their financial problems.<br /><br />What Kiyosaki is suggesting is to change our paradigm and realize that freedom comes from building wealth and not being afraid to take risks. He talks about thinking logically instead of reacting emotionally and to become financially educated so we are not stuck in a helpless situation years later when our \\"secure\\" job eventually fails us and leaves us with debt. I highly recommend this book to any who would like to avoid the rat race and put your money to work for you, rather then slaving you life away for an employer because you have no more freedom.

0385535147|1.0|This is one of those books where the narrative goes on and on without giving you much of any idea what is actually taking place --- and then tells the story at the end of the book. Just read the end of the book where he finally tells you what is going on and save yourself a great deal of time.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The writing for this show in the second half of season 4 is suburb, and when it's only really good, the casting of these endearing, quirky, intoxicatingly hot characters sends it consistently over the top. Also, how can you not love a show who's creators actually LISTEN to fan feedback -- thanks for killing off Kalinda's husband!
0385536828|2.0|I really wanted to like this book.  I've thoroughly enjoyed Ian McEwan's work in the past, but in Sweet Tooth, he overstretched.  The main character is not a believable young woman.  While I understand the psychology McEwan is pulling from to write her, I've never met a young woman (nor experienced it myself) who thinks the way he's written her.  I pushed through to the end, and I'm glad I did, but I would have been better off not starting this book in the first place.  I don't understand why this has gotten the acclaim it has received.  Unless you are a diehard fan, pass this one up.
0307277887|4.0|**CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS**<br />  I am an avid reader, to say the least. After becoming a Dexter series fan, I decided to purchase the entire series of books. I figured, of course, that they would be even better than the show, as books almost without exception always are. However, for the third time in my life so far, I am now able to say that I actually prefer the show (or movie, as it's usually a movie) over the book. The only other two examples I have of this phenomenon are the movies and books I, Robot and I Am Legend. Those books sucked.<br />  In the case of Darkly Dreaming Dexter, I found most of the entire book entralling, just as I did the series. And then, I realized I was almost at the end of the book, and he had not yet encountered his brother, and that a few other very important events from the show's first season hadn't happened and had no time in which to happen. I was almost finished. Suddenly, in the last four or five pages, all of these things seem to happen suddenly, and they all fell together horribly in this dissappointing, completely illogical way which made absolutely no sense. I did not expect the book to be exactly like the show, of course, that would be boring. However, I also didn't expect LaGuerta to at the end of the very first installment of this series IMMEDIATELY already suspect Dexter of being a killer, and yet let him randomly wander off so that they could \\"split up\\" to find the serial killer that she half thought was Dexter, anyway. I didn't expect Dexter to come SO CLOSE to MURDERING his own sister, who was completely conscious the whole time, and begging him not to, as he alternated between seemingly talking to himself (which was him talking to Harry, his dead foster father), and his biological serial killer brother who had placed her there for Dexter to kill her in the first place, and was coaxing him into following through and stabbing her. Then, I didn't expect Dexter to suddenly, with no explained reason, decide not to kill her at the last possible second, to have his brother simply say \\"I'm disappointed in you\\" and murder LaGuerta in front of Deborah, and then have Dexter assist him in his escape, before apparently then releasing his cop foster sister. The book ends with LaGuerta's funeral, and absolutely no explaination of why Deborah isn't, apparently, all that pissed off about her brother nearly killing her, and then helping his biological serial killer brother, whom abducted her in the first place and tried to have Dexter murder her, escape. She doesn't turn her brother in, and yet earlier that very same day, before her traumatizing abduction, Deb had told Dexter that if she found out he was the one on some video camera footage she had found at a crime scene (it was actually Dexter's brother, who was unknown to him at the time), and thereby a suspect in these murders, she would, herself, have to turn him in, no matter how much she loved him and that he was the only family she had left. And so, afterward, the reader is left just guessing, apparently, as I am about a quarter into the second book, and still the only shred of explaination involving Deb's attitude or even reference of any kind to the absurd ending to the previous book is that Deb is \\"trying to forgive\\" Dexter. Okkkaaaay....yeah, I would totally not, at the very least, want my brother locked up in a mental institution if he held a knife over my body while I was strapped to a table and nearly brought it down upon me several times while I begged him not to. I would feel completely safe with him...Don't get me wrong. I understand love. Completely. Loyalty. I do. I understand everything about the way that the Debarah of the TV series reacted upon learning of her brother's passtime of being a serial killer in season 6 and 7. However, it took a LOT for that response to come about and we just were not ready for it in this first book. We have no knowledge at all of what is making her not turn him in, and also not be TERRIFIED ofhim! In the show, Dexter shows season after season that he WOULD NEVER harm his sister, allow harm to come upon her, or even harm an innocent person. He is a completely different Dexter in the books, and so far, I don't really like him very much!<br />  Don't get me wrong, I'm not returning the rest of the books. In their own way they are still great, and I have to know everything there is to know about Dexter in every form available to me. I am just saying that I'm a little disappointed, so far.him!

B0038P59A0|4.0|I didn't have that high of an expectation going into this. Robert Downey Jr as Sherlock Holmes?? If you are a huge fan of the novels or the BBC modern day adaption be warned this is a a re-imagination of the character.  Does that make it bad, no, it's a movie for fun and entertainment and on that point it definitely scores.  Downey Jr, as Sherlock is like a feisty super gifted little super hero with a snarky attitude, as I saw it.  Throw in the special effects, lots of action and humor and you have a fun movie for an evening.  I enjoyed this version for what it was, an action romp that kept you entertained for a couple of hours and I am looking forward to watching the sequel, which I imagine is the best compliment you can give a movie.
B000G8NXYG|4.0|Classic film, great restoration, good extras. All you'd want from The Criterion Collection. The pace of the film, however, won't be for everyone.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Fantastic!!!  I was and still am a big super hero fan, the Avengers, Spider Man, Batman you name it.  This was the perfect ending for a trilogy.  If you liked the first two you will definitely be pleased with this final film.  Will it be the last one? From what I have read, yes, and though part of me wishes it would go on I think ending the story now on a high is probably the right move.  Like all great classics there is a great beginning, middle and final conclusion that wraps everything up.  This movie did just that.  Now I need to get the trilogy in a nice boxed set for my collection. So in conclusion, if you like these kinds of movies and in particular Batman this will not disappoint, however, if you have not seen the first two yet you owe it to yourself to watch them in order first and then watch this one for maximum enjoyment.

B00BF123WG|4.0|While we though Zero Dark Thirty was good, Argo was a much better film.  ZDT is more of a documentary and it assumes you know what all the acronyms mean.  Perhaps because we knew the plot line so well from news and interviews the tension was lessened.

The dictionary was the only book on it due to me just finding it the other day. Hey did you know that opal means tears? Bet you didn't but that's okay cause you'll learn by reading this book. Well not really a book but a dictionary so… yeah thats basiclly it. Also I totally recommend using this as a reference while reading books. Like get one of those hard books that you could never really understand because of the big words or just plain old words you don't know. Well that's pretty much it enjoy reading  a dictionary.

B009M4KTEM|5.0|Jerry Garcia has been gone since 1995 but because of efforts like this, his music lives on for new generations to enjoy.  His work with the Grateful Dead remains wondrous.  Ask yourself -- is it bleugrass, jazz, blues, country?  Can't anwer, can you?  But this collection transcends his work with the Dead and features Dylan songs he loved so, some standards, some traditional stuff, all musically mastered exquisitely.  Garcia is to American music what people like Woody Guthrie and Stephen Foster were in their generations.

They are not specific of one discipline, but may be understood by anyone.  I read the book too quickly!  I have to read it again to absolve the wealth of information that it has.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in making our world a better place to live, regardless of the discipline or profession that they practice.  I will certainly recommend this to my university students.
B000003337|5.0|Great glance into the past, more so if you know the history. Cant figure out why these guys couldnt get signed at the time. Good stuff...and Amazon wasted no time getting it to me...thanks
B000VDUWMC|4.0|This book gives a cogent overview of the author's ideas concerning human societies and the spread of &#34;civilization&#34; into new areas. It ties together many different historical trends in a way that is helpful and understandable.
0345803485|4.0|This was a very good book, though not for the faint of heart.  The racy sexual language and situations were a bit much, and not needed to make for good reading.  I prefer some things left to the imagination.  It should be sold at adult book stores where people who enjoy that sort of language and dom/sub lifestyle can enjoy it.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I've been a Civil War and film buff all my life and having read hundreds of books on the war I felt while watching this movie that I was peering into a time window.  The sets, costumes, dialect, etc, were simply stunning as were the actors.  The best film I've seen in years.
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|The book is filled with mystery and charm.<br /><br />The movie is a neurological attack on the mind.<br /><br />It must have 1000s of cuts... hordes and hordes and hordes of ugly little beings that never stop coming and have no frightening qualities... because the script is dull and the acting worse. At least the Ring movies had some strong personalities... even they by the mid part of the 2nd movie had become pretentious fantasy redundant boredom.<br /><br />Green Screen animation is WRECKING the movies.<br />No character subtly, no need to create script tension... lets just get to the 'effects!'<br /><br />An ugly boring... small... never ending troll car chase.<br />Don't!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Excellent read and made one wonder if the search for Osama would ever come to a conclusion. One young lady never gave up her search and if not for her we would still be searching for the terrorist responsible for 9/11. Hand salute to the Navy Seals who pulled this off with so many obstacles they were facing even with one of their own helicopters crashing at the site. Great read!
B000JLQSWE|4.0|I love this record for being a little album full of APP doing pop. When I heard it for the first time back in 1990, I thought it was great, specially \\"Sooner Or Later\\". Some friend of mine made me a copy and wrote incorrectly the track title, \\"The Same old **Sound**\\" so well, I did not what the song was about so no biggie (I didn't speak English at the time). Try mixing \\"Get Off\\" by Foxxy with \\"Hawkeye\\": You'll notice they have the same key and beat so you can do some damage at the dance floor with this record too. Maybe Mr. Parsons didn't like it because it was \\"forced\\" by the record label in order to produce more hits a-la \\"Eye In The Sky\\". Woolfson delivers but he's all over the album: \\"Sooner or Later\\", \\"Separate Lives\\", \\"Same Old Sun\\". I always considered Woolfson as my favorite APP vocalist and maybe one of the great voices in pop, so for me this was more than OK.<br /><br />I highly recommend it as a follow up to \\"Eye In The Sky\\", if you want to hear it for the first time.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This  is an awesome games! I died so many time just looking at the scenery. This is way better than the first one and it was  great!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You have to get this game. Temple Run 2 is 100% better then the last one. There are more features, like the mincart and zipline, you can get gems, and there are less characters to get. One teeny thing: the prices are high, but then...
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I absolutely adore this book. An escape like no other.  The writing is ethereal and captures the reader from the first page.  Great combination of lire with history.
B00993G41S|4.0|Traditional British comedy - great performance by Jamie Lee Curtis & John Cleese.<br />Shallow, naïve plot, but timing was good and I ended up rolling on the ground laughing out loud.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|the product actually showed up before the expected date...it was wrapped still and not even scuff on plastic wrap...It made an amazing Easter gift the young lady that received it was elated and so was i and i would gladly purchase from seller again
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game was a lot of fun to play and to top it all off, it was free too. Love it.Awesome<br />.
030758836X|2.0|Gone Girl, a story about a marriage gone horribly wrong, leaves no stone unturned when it comes to building up a living, breathing world and surprisingly well-fleshed out characters to occupy it.  The first part, arguably the best of the book, begins as a standard crime thriller when Amy Dunne, wife of aloof Nick Dunne, just up and disappears.  Foul play is suspected and the police quickly become involved.<br /><br />Where it goes from there, however, is a mess.  The story falters, quickly devolving into a descent into a cesspool of madness.  Part II still retains some of the suspense that you got in Part I, but by the time you've reached the third act, it just falls flat.  From there on out, I would advise anyone considering giving this a read that you do not expect anything great from the ending.<br /><br />The finale is nothing like what the book seemingly lead you to believe it was building towards.  Instead, you get an anticlimactic pile of bull**** that only ruins the time you've invested into the book.  2 stars for a great first act and an enjoyable second act, but the last act of the book just brings it down.  I have no desire to read any of Gillian Flynn's other work after this.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|Not a 'collector's set', but high quality Blu-ray disks and plenty of extras for those looking for a little more than just the movies.
B0063GORYU|3.0|There is not enough interesting play.  It is too easy to win each game.  More difficulty would be challenging to me.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love HBO series and couldn't wait to read the books.  Downloaded fast and easily to my tablet and smart phone.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Modern Combat 4 was attempted on Kindle fire and I must say \\"WOW\\" it does play well and the game-play is intense. I was concerned at first that this game being so big might not even load and work on the original kindle fire but I am amazed by the fact that not only it works it also plays rather nice. If you are into first person shooting games this will definitely fit the bill. The reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the rather long download times and load times I had to clean up and delete a lot of apps and games to make room for this game to install and load. Game otherwise is pretty good to play and visual effects, voice are excellent. My feedback would be make this game simpler for people who do not wish to play online and have that as additional 'optional' download for multi-player to make the game easy to load and install.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I purchased this movie for a friend and I loved the price and the fast shipping! I would recommend this to anyone looking for good movies at a great price.
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|If you shop a lot on Amazon and if you have a non-amazon Tablet device like [[ASIN:B007M50PTM Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch, Wi-Fi)]] you will find this app very useful. Searching for items and browsing using stock browser is a pain. But using this app navigation is a breeze it is easy to find items you are looking for and the presentation is excellent. I had wished that it would integrate Amazon Instant video for Prime subscribers but that seems like it is just a wishful thinking. Amazon does need to come up with Amazon Instant video app for other tablets and hand held devices on the market other than Kindle hardware that seem to integrate beautifully. Kindles being Android devices just like other Android based tablets there is no technical reason for Amazon Instant video not to work on those devices. It is merely a business decision as far as it seems. Please open it up for 'Prime members' with registered certified tablet devices on their account and you will see more prime membership activation for sure down the line as a lot of Android users love Amazon Prime instant video offerings just like me.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I would recommend this game to dragon lover's love this so much I cant tell you how great this game is
B00B780TAK|1.0|I eagerly anticipated watching the final episode of Downtown Abbey and as I settled in to watch, it wouldn't play.  Well, it played for the first 27 seconds, then said I needed to update my flashplayer. So, I did, just in case. Still the same thing. A waste of time and money.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I ended up purchasing the ad free version when it was on sale.  I use this for basic calculations and it does fine.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pe is awesome to play because it is not boring it is just awesome to play because you can craft and mine things like diamonds and gold it is awesome to create your designs.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Incredibly interesting for such a long (755 pages) volume.  A worthy book worth the time to read and savor.  Makes me want to learn more about the many people who influenced the length and outcome of The Civil War.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|WOW! The first half of the book was all ... erotic stories! But then, the rest of the book has a psychologic turn to it.  VERY GOOD!!!
B006362ZR6|5.0|I love the fray and this album just continues my enjoyment of them!<br /><br />When I listened to the album, I immediately had 2-3 songs I absolutely loved. Then, the more I listened to the album, the songs I start didn't notice at first became my personal favorites.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|SO GOOD! Better than the first one (as much erotic stories but more story around it). I'm in love with Grey!!!
B005LAII4E|4.0|So after liking the first GI Joe Movie, I was worried about the sequel as most of the critics panned it .. 30% rotton. But they said the same about the first one (Rise of Cobra). It's a direct sequel, so you have to see the first one to understand this film.<br />Now this is a fantasy action movie, so the story was completely implausible, and some characters were just thrown in there like they just needed a reason to sell more action figures. But I can't help but love the nostalgia of it all, as I had a good many of the original toys in the 80's. And, to my excellent surprise, it was good, and the adventure moved along well. It is very action packed with cutting-edge special effects. The movie kept my male/21st-century brain at attention. I was so engaged that I didn't even eat my overpriced concession snack. (The downside was that I couldn't find a good place to go to the bathroom).  So I must give it a healthy 4.0/5 stars. I'll definitely want to watch it again. But for a non-fan, you might hate it along with the critics. Final Say: If you saw the first GI Joe movie, and liked it, then you'll like this one too. I did.  ~Keep On
B0063IH60K|5.0|I PLAY WHILE WATCHING TV AT NIGHT. IT IS NOT STRESSFUL VERY RELAXING AND FUN. EASY TO PLAY AND UNDERSTAND. THANKS
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The author had a first hand account of what happened. He was there. Unlike reading a book written by a talking head from the media.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I am about 3/4 into it and am not sure how the story will end.  There are two more books in the series so will definitely download and read them.
B003UMW62A|5.0|I love this movie for good family entertainment.  Adam Sandler gives an outstanding performance.  My kids and I call this the bubble gum movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best game ever I bought this of of Amazon for my kindle  fire.it's the best game ever
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Good writing makes this show a must see.  I look forward to the next episode every week.  If you like horror shows this is for you.
1619695006|3.0|This is so NOT Harry Potter or really anything you want to get near your kids. Or read to them. Or expose them to. If my kid did the stuff the teens in this book I would have to lock him up. Great googley-moogley. What a sad and depressing (realistic for some) world these people in the book live in. Being a social worker myself, I was depressed with the lack of \\"pulling themselves up by the boot straps\\" anyone managed. This novel makes me want to go read Harry Potter to cheer myself a little bit. Or go drink some alcohol. Or hug a kitten.<br /><br />Eeek!<br /><br />Even through it's uber depressing, the book is a gritty, realistic of a small town in all its yucky glory.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|This was an enjoyable movie and I had a few good laughs, but as a follow up spin off to the absolutely hilarious Knocked Up, you just go in expecting a lot. It's a decent movie, but I wouldn't go far out of my way to watch it.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|This book took me by surprise, John Taylor was my first pop-star crush and 30 years later I still &#34;love&#34; him. But his book was not what I expected at all. It was SO personal, open and honest and it moved me, it actually made me feel bad for having posters of him on my walls. :-) I thought I would love reading about the &#34;Duran Duran fame&#34; bit but found that his struggle with alcohol, drugs, depression and the way out made him more real than the stories about the screaming girls. John Taylor as a real person is much better than John Taylor hunky pop-star and I am glad he shared his story with us all :-)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|even better when I could get it straight on my phone so that I can read it!  now I have to slow down on it so that when the 2nd movie comes in i'll know closer what's going on.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I really didn't know anything about this stylus when I purchased it but I knew if I didn't like it that Amazon would take it back with no hassle.  Now that I have it, I wouldn't give it up under any circumstance!  This is my favorite stylus out of many others that I have!  The three different size tips are so nice and really convenient, the smallest size is perfect to use with my iPhone!  I would highly recommend this to everyone as the best and most versatile stylus I've ever used !
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|You know it is not easy to find good and entertaining games. This is one of them. Very fun and entertaining but huge issue with controls such as you want to turn back instead it jumps right on the obstacles. I have Galaxy S3 so I don't think my phone has any problems with lag. So if I was the developer and continue on this journey I would pay little more attention to my work. But again it is a great game that's why I gave 4 stars.
0385343248|5.0|Possibly my all time favorite book. Never goes out of style. Great characters, intrigue, action and a wonderful love story.
B005NGKMOU|5.0|Another great western movie, that did not get much publicity. Strong storyline, with Sam Shepard giving a stellar performance. You won't be disappointed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great entertainment with high quality acting and twists in plots. It was better than watching most hollywood movies produced today
B007EECSFA|5.0|Really great read. Loved the story was unpredictable. One of a few books I would read again! I have been recommending this book to all of my friends.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|.Watch it over and over.When my son comes over we watch it again.I can't wait until the next movie.Hope they keep in going.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The story line is great, the ideas are original and intriguing.<br />Nine more words are required. Nine more words are
B001JIFYSA|5.0|LOVE ACTUALLY FEATURES MANY LOVE STORIES INTERTWINED.<br />VERY WELL WRITTEN FEATURING MANY STARS IN GREAT PERFORMANCES<br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND VIEWING THIS FILM
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book each time I read it. Travis.....he'll make you crazy mad one minute and SWOON the next! Very much looking forward to the follow-up releasing TWO HOURS FROM NOW!!!!!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Always like to try a new Maj Jong game. Seems like it will be fun. just started, it is not too challenging yet.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|First book I've read before the movie came out .  And it was amazing !!! Will recommend to family and friends
B005COO1X6|4.0|Stephen King knows how to write a good story.  I read this short story and wanted more when I finished the last page.
1401324517|5.0|Nadal is certainly one of the greatest tennis players in history. But more than that, he is a fantastic and dedicated athlete. This book shows a bit of this amazing dedication to the sport and commitment to victory. A great sportsmanship. It's a must read to all tennis lovers but also fantastic to anyone who enjoys sports and want/need some inspiration in commitment.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|My kids really enjoyed this movie. Would definately recommend for kids of all ages.  My teenage son even enjoyed watching.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is very good. I was a little concerned about where it was going then it twisted and captured my attention all over!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|The music is wonderful, but only the songs associated with the brothel or inn is not to my liking.  The one good thing is I am able to fast forward to skip a portion and still enjoy all the rest.
B0058YPGL6|4.0|Not a bad series. Very interesting take on the Werewolf phenomena. Definitely an MTV series, fits the older teen audience well.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|IF you are tired of the garbage hollywood puts out here is a great clean flix  for you Story line is great.
B00992CF6W|5.0|when is the next update man this is AWSOME man when is it it just need these thing<br />jungle<br />wolves<br />cats<br />cake<br />and mods<br />fish
B0047Y17P2|4.0|This book is a decent read for people who like following the very detailed legal debates and various schemes presented between processors and defence attorneys
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I bought this book after seeing the movie.  I typically read books before I watch movies, however, the movie compelled me to read the book.  The book was way better than the movie.  Of course there was more back story and more details which made the story even better.  All though this is not my favorite Nicholas Sparks book, it was a quick read and I enjoyed reading it.
B009AMANBA|1.0|I believe people like this movie for the wrong reasons -- the same reason they like Lincoln -- because they \\"should\\" -- because they think the war was about freeing the slaves. The truth is, Lincoln declared war on his own country over a tariff tax. The abolition of slavery came later, which is one of the few historical accuracies depicted in the film. Taking liberties with history would be fine if they were at least replaced with some drama. But what is most surprising is how Spielberg really missed the mark in so many ways.  The script is sluggish and one dimensional, the dialogue is dull and the behavior is anachronistic. There is a severe lack of sweep or epic nature that the subject matter demands. Battles scenes are described, not enacted. (As is his assassination).  It's simply a bad movie and bad history.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Argo is a great film, but a common issue with streaming video from Amazon is low picture quality and buffer.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I had seen this movie years ago, and remembered the impact it had. So when it came up again in my online searching for movies, I jumped at the chance to buy it. It is so well done. It is the dramatisation of William Wilberforce's struggle to outlaw slavery in Great Britain during the late 1700s.<br /><br />Ioan Gruffudd is excellent, as always. Frankly a pity he is not in more big blockbusters. Of course the supporting cast had a couple big names in Michael Gambon, Benedict Cumberbatch, Albert Finney, and Jeremy Swift, but Romola Garai really shined as Wilberforce's soulmate.<br /><br />This movie *will* make you cry, but it is a good sort of cry.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Reminded me of Breakfast Club.  Great characters and heartfelt story.  The ending was a surprise and done well.  A great film on a rainy day.
B008KYOCA2|2.0|I bought it, but I didn't like the way it was laid out, so I bought something else that works much better.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|this application is very helpful specially when you traveling the country in the winter. it is user friendly since we can managed it. I would recommend to anyone.-
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|So far so good. Runs smooth and is challenging. I keep improving my score so haven't gotten tired of it yet.
1609611543|3.0|I felt that this book was a little long winded on history of wheat in our diets and not enough on how to eliminate it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Excellent cast and script with superb sets and costuming. The last scene in the last episode is a real shocker! Like each episode, it teases one to want more.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|VERY easy to pick up using tutorial. I have only played about four levels so I only gave it a four star rating. I would rather wait until I played a while more, but they wanted a review. IF I find out this is a \\"money pit\\" I WILL come back and adjust my rating accordingly. If this game continues well, I will give it 5 stars.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The last episode of this season is even more surprising than the last one of the last season! Well developed story line.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game because I eat lots of fish and I grow my shark I also make baby sharks
044024613X|5.0|This is a novel that will most likely leave you a bit uneasy and thinking it certainly could happen anywhere. The questions for thought at the end really do give cause to think seriously about the story;lne and its characters.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|The author presents us with a series of challenges...a client you want to believe is innocent, and a very substantial case that offers a series of challenges for the defense attorney, Mickey Haller. One surprise follows another and, as one chapter leads to another, the book is increasingly difficult to set aside. I've enjoyed Michael Connelly's novels, but this one was particularly entertaining.
1416550542|5.0|I loved this book more than I expected. At first it was hard to get into it. But after I got a few chapters in I wanted to read to the end.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|the picture and sound were awsome<br />one of my favorite liza minnelli film.<br />the extras were great also.<br />i highly recommend it
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Does what it says. For the small price of two bucks the developers deserve a small fee for coming up with this app.
B009AMANH4|3.0|the film was ok but expected more to the film. what was there was good but expected so much more from steven spielberg<br />Daniel Day lewis was great as Lincoln so was Sally field as Mrs Lincoln but i wanted more of the story of Lincoln
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great basic calculator and best of all it's free.<br />Comes in handy when I need it and I seem to use it daily.
B008220C56|5.0|Keira Knightley was awsome as Anna<br />also the rest of the cast a interesting way of showing the  film and the sets were awsome
1250004217|3.0|My wife just finished reading it (in one day). When I asked her what she thought of it, she said that it was &#34;lackluster,&#34; &#34;hohum,&#34; and &#34;not worth the money.&#34; As soon as I get more info, I'll write more.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The Picture and sound subperb<br />the actors  were awsome especially Anne Hathaway<br />the scenery and sets were awsome a must buy dvd if you love the musical
B0086DBE62|5.0|We've been waiting for this ever since it came out. We loved the twisted very of the stale fairytale; it was fun and enthralling.<br />First, I loved that fact that the princess had not plucked her eyebrows. This may seem a bit shallow, but my girls have the same trait, and I've always worried that they would be ashamed of this. Having a very pretty girl who didn't slip into the Hollywood stereotype was gratifying.<br />Roberts was very fun and played the heavy very well. Hmmm... I wonder if she really is that way in real life :))<br />The only thing I regret is the fact that the monster (an unusual twist) was more handsome than the king.
B0064W667Y|5.0|This twisted vision of fairy tales is refreshing and authentic. It is beautifully illustrated and the stories are very entertaining. If you like comics/graphic novels, you can't miss this one. I also feel that &#34;Fables&#34; has influenced many thing that we see currently on movies and television, especially the TV Show &#34;Once Upon a Time&#34;.
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|Very good game the graphics seem to be quite good there's nothing wrong with the game itself just it needs more levels that are harder I had no problem beating the game in less than 20 minutes but over all the game is fun and I enjoy it
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I'm 13 and I am not a reader. I never read really. But I actually read this and loved it. Very good book.
B000WYF2FW|4.0|This album is way too long and even with the remixes it remains over-produced.  Even so it has almost all of George Harrison's best post-Beatle work.  It features George at the height of his song-writing ability.  It's well worth having for the individual tracks, even if the jam sessions at the end feel as though they'll never end.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A thrill-ride of a season!  There are the occasional episodes where it's a little slow, but they still set up the characters nicely.  I was definitely on the edge of my seat the whole season.
1416562605|5.0|I raced to finish this book because I had so much adrenaline from reading it. Then I bought it for someone else as a gift.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great fun with an intriguing storyline. The graphics are very well executed.The hog games are not too difficult and you can zoom in.
1476734941|5.0|The guidelines are easy to follow, the recipes tasty and uncomplicated.  More than anything, weighing the portions heightens awareness of caloric intake even on the off fasting days.  It boils down to some slight behavior modifications with measurable results.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider, it's fun and challenging. It's also a great way to<br />pass time while keeping the mind sharp!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This series is just so captivating -- from the setting to the story line to the actors and actresses - it is wonderful!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Pretty cool game and I got the moon Dragon it takes a lot of time to breed etc.  But it is an addictive and fun game.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|i'm a big  Tolkien fan perfect movie and i liked how they gave some backstory true to the books with frodos appearance, only thing wrong was the instant video freezing on the wii u, please fix that amazon!! but that's not the movies fault.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is awesome! The movie was good and so is the game it has cool powerups and graphics. Totally worth 99&cent; .
B009FZFONO|4.0|...not as good as season 2 i think, but still a great show yay murryl!! boo sword girl always causin' trouble!
0321811984|5.0|This is an inspiring book on presentation.  The presentation creation process and the powerpoint graphic creation approach suggested in this book help to create more interesting and more powerful presentation.  I adopted and modified many ideas from this book in my own presentations with great success for years.<br /><br />If you have been creating your presentation mainly by using the features of MS Powerpoint, I suggest you read this book and quickly.  It will definitely make your presentation more interesting and with more impact.<br /><br />Some readers are intimidated by Garr Reynolds approach because the graphic elements involved.  They look so polished, like something created by advertising companies.  The fact is once you understand the basic concepts behind the whole approach after reading the book, you will realize it is not that difficult to come up with suitable graphics.  Depending on the presentation subject matter, the graphics can be as simple as photos you have taken yourself.<br /><br />By following the presentation creation approach suggested by this book, there will be practically no chance that a presenter will read from the slides during the presentation because there are few words or no words in each slide. The powerpoint becomes a supporting tool than the star of the presentation.  The presenter will then have more chance to communicate and interact with the audience during the presentation.<br /><br />Once you understand the presentation concepts in this book, you will see how Steve Jobs had been using similar ideas in his presentations.<br /><br />If you need to make presentations, do yourself a favor, read this book today!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Can't imagine what praise I can add to the worldwide acceptance and accolades this video has already received. The story lines are so interesting as each and every character is 'fleshed out' with so many interesting twists and turns.  Great production and the scenes are so rich and beautiful.  Can't wait to receive the next set of DVDs.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Worth the time. Clever and well written. Also well thought out story line. Actually motivates me to resume my own writing.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's alright but is too hard to unlock the new people and gets a bit boring after a while but is good apart from that
B008M87GJK|5.0|Adjustable to one's taste and interests. Constantly updated. Gives one a quick overview of the day's news plus a reasonable number of feature articles.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is awesome. No matter what type of book you like, Greek gods and goddesses is fun and entertaining. My friends and I always find something to talk about with Rick Riordan books.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|What a great read! Can't wait to retrace some of Mr. Bryson's steps, and create some of our own. Delightful writing and wonderful imagery.
B003O86FMW|3.0|it's not as good as the first book but unlike it this ending has an opening for what sounds like a good next story. I LOVE EDMUND BRODERICK
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I took the time to read a good sampling of reviews from each star rating, from five to one.  I downloaded the app and immediately began using it on a constant basis.<br /><br />I must be missing something or it could be user problems on other systems because I have never experienced a hot Kindle, or depleted battery, I use my Kindle Fire HD all day and when I get home, I still have plenty of battery to watch a movie, or read magazines/books.<br /><br />Sorry, I just do not see the problems that others have had.<br /><br />In any case, I have had this app installed for the last 5 months and just love it, so much so I will be buying the Pro version when I am done here.  Being a Senior Software Engineer, I want to make sure to get these guys some money for their work on a great app.<br /><br />Good work!!!
B007N85POS|5.0|It a game and fun to play.  I enjoy it there really isn't much more to say about it - there
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A Game of Thrones is a must read!!!!!! Very very very good, and really well written. Give it a try!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is a great game to play. at first it looked like an ordinary app,then after witnessing it i wanted to play it on the spot.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Certainly one of my favorite shows. Very well written with top notch acting.  I am looking forward to seeing how they develop the M.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|hot trail I enjoy it kids enjoy it its fun lol work hard build benefit get rewarded fun fun fun
B0000001CT|5.0|I my opinion this is the next to best pressing you can purchase of this recording. The Classic Record recording is also great if you can find one that is not dished (warped). Tube Mastered by Steve Hoffman from the original master tapes. This recording is worth the the price of admission if you can afford it. The BEST pressing of this record is the Classic Records 45 speed Clarity Vinyl red box set. There are 4 LP's mastered at 45 speed pressed on the Clarity Virgin vinyl. IF you can find one and afford if this is the one to have. Actually any of the Classic records box sets is worth owning from a sonic perspective. I feel these records (if you can buy them at the right price) are well worth the investment as they will continue to grow in value.
B004PIOYIW|2.0|but I've seen it before and its a great movie so hopefully amazon will get this fixed as other movies had sound.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The characters are well developed and truly seem to reflect what was going on in each country during those awful days.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I must admit I haven't finished season 2 yet, but I am so in love with this series it's hard to go to work everyday knowing I could be home watching some more episodes!  Hmmmmm, maybe I'll call in sick tomorrow :)
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I absolutely love Josh Groban - I several of his CD's as well as 2 of his Concert DVD's which are my favorite.  I prefer to watch the performance,  AWESOME!!!!
0988262592|5.0|This book was picked on a whim (by me) for our IT Leadership Team Book Club.  We have gone through several titles with varying degrees of useful information, but I completely lucked out with this choice, as it highlights many of the things we are currently considering.  It was a GREAT read and I would highly recommend it!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book is a must read. It held me captive non stop. This book is very hard to put down. It is one of those books that you do not want to end.
034580404X|5.0|Not finished with the trilogy yet, but I am loving the books so far! Definitely going to share these books!!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is a good game to pass the time, however it can get a bit boring after a while and after you have used all your lives it is boring waiting for more. more. Overall I think it is a good game to get and after all it is free!
014241722X|5.0|Count on John Grisham to deliver a winner of a well written, readable young adult book. I highly recommend it.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|does not work on Samsung galaxy s2 and several calls to help - they know less than I (not much)
B0081SKYDG|5.0|This was a movie that was purchased for my son, and one that I have not watched. I can attest to the ease in which the ordering process takes place and my only wish is that we could have rented this movie as opposed to purchasing it. I am very happy with the vast selection of movies and television shows that Amazon offers. I have been a long time Netflix customer, streaming only, and their movie selection is not nearly as vast as that of Amazon. I am so happy with the movie/TV show selection that, in fact, I have become a prime member just for that reason. I wish that every movie and or television show was included in the prime membership but I understand the reasoning behind why Sarmar and some aren't and I am still happy to be a prime member.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Feeling the Oscar buzz, we rented this film. Loved it as a story... suspenseful, surprising, heartwarming, fun. This film shows the best in human kind. Oh, and the soundtrack is amazing. Wish so bad Rodriguez had been at my record store growing up.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you can stomach the dialouge, the action is great and the story is fairly original.  Tiresome characters seem to be eliminated in a timely fashion.
B00AHGSVKS|3.0|I didn't expect a whole lot from tis book given when it was written, but then I had just read the PERN series by McCaffrey, so I could see a big difference.  While Clark tells an interesting story, his characters are not well fleshed out, which means you can't identify with them and feel their ups and downs.  On the whole, the book was disappointing.
0345525558|5.0|I checked this book out from the library, but had to order my own copy so I could have access to it whenever I wished.  It is new, fresh, and unusual.  Original characters nicely drawn.  A wonderful reading experience.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it but if u get it on xbox than it will be worth it.northsparten add as a firend and I will show u a good world.I have big statcus(idk)of thebajencanatian tobucus deadox captainsparkels and antvenom.<br />Ps.help me build
B00A93ENX8|2.0|First, This is a rating of the sound quality of this release-not the music. I bought Counterparts on CD the day it came out in 1993 and loved it, It is one of Rush's better albums and certainly their best from the 90's. When I saw this was to be released on SACD I was very excited, But my excitement quickly turned to disappointment when I received my copy and put it in my Denon universal player and hit play. From the first few seconds of the opening track I knew something was up. I began jumping from track to track listening to only a few seconds of each before I fired up my CD copy in my CD changer to compare the sound, as I suspected there really wasn't much difference. The next day I sat down and listened to the whole SACD all the way through for a &#34;critical listen&#34;, when I was done I started the 20 year old CD copy again and it only took a few moments to confirm the lack of improvement in the SACD version. There is a &#34;difference&#34; between the two just not a real &#34;improvement&#34;, Kind of like the difference between listening to a cassette tape with Dolby-B Noise reduction on vs. off. There is a difference like lower tape noise but also duller highs, either way you are still listening to the same tape &#34;source&#34;, Thats what I feel like with this release, The background noise is reduced and the levels are lower and more &#34;controlled&#34; but it still sounds like the same 44.1/16 bit source ran through a filter or processor. There is no &#34;openness&#34;, &#34;wider sound-stage&#34; ,&#34; improved dynamics&#34; or &#34;3 dimensional sound&#34; that you would expect from SACD, DVD-A, or any other Hi-Res Source, it just sounds like a slightly cleaner CD. If you already own Counterparts on CD then stop right there no further action is needed, if you are looking to get a copy then just pick up the regular CD version or (Gulp, Dare I say it?) Download an Mp3 copy. Even a $10 Mp3 download would be money better spent than $25 for this SACD.It has been a long time since I felt this ripped off, This was my first and most likely my last purchase from &#34;Audio Fidelity&#34;. This disc is going on E-bay so I can at least recoup a couple of dollars I wasted on this &#34;sonic turd&#34;. I cannot stress this enough, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS SACD VERSION !!!
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Bond movies are always action-packed and fun to watch. This one is no different, is entertaining. Not life changing, just plain entertaining.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a great read but some of the grammar and the phrasing of the words were hard to understand. I found myself reading things more than one just so I could understand what was being said. Other than that, I thought it was a great story line but easy to guess what was going to happen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The update will include online multiplayer buckets redstone more settings texture packs new mobs new sky and much more! Cannot wait
B000SGSU58|5.0|Good book. But I don't like this required review business<br />The old Kindle archive at the end of a book was better.
0920668372|4.0|I was happy with the how fast it arrived, how well it was packaged. The book was in great shape. I was very happy.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|I had to see if their was something on the movie list for me than I found this movie. I would like to see a part two made because I think its the right time for such a story line. This movie shipped and arrived right away. Thanks for such great movies I know one day this will be considered a classic.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I need something for the times when I'm waiting for some one or something and need to pass the time. This game is great for that and really fun too.
030758836X|5.0|This melodramatic thriller has more twists and turns than a roller coaster, the fun ones, not the ones that make you sick.  Flynn allows the two main characters to be extremely flawed, but draws you so much into them that you find yourself alternately rooting for each in many occasions.  It's twisted, fun, dark and intimately horrifying.  We've all met people or couples that have the potential for this result, hopefully rarely to fruition. Some reviews I've read from other readers state that the ending was horrible.  I agree, but did you expect anything else?  The ending fits perfectly.
B008BIN9EW|3.0|its alright, but didn't care much for the game type. I probably played it for an hour then i stop.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|I just did not like the set-up on it figured it would be like regular slots but it is not
1451695195|2.0|I am in my 70's, and was very disturbed by this book, because it points<br />the way to a false god and may cause a lot of people to look in the wrong<br />places for &#34;salvation&#34;.  I have read accounts of peoples trips into eternity,<br />for many years, and I know that the Doctor was taken on trip, but I feel he<br />was greatly disceived.  The reason I am so sure is look where the Website<br />takes you to at the end of the book.<br />Believe me Heaven is Real, but so is Hell!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Very fun and makes you think. Love it!! I like looking for the hard and small things like a spoon
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can do so many things and it is the best game for kindle can't wait for the new update
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I just found this read to be the same old thing....white plantation owners raping their black slaves and the wives of the slave owners just being weak women.  It's the titillation of these issues, as written by the author, that I find disturbing.  Other then that -- it's a quick read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Absolutely spell binding, I found it so hard to put the book down. I can't wait to start the third book in this trilogy, it reminds me of the John Jake's saga starting with the, \\"Bastard\\"
0736041850|5.0|I love this book. My husband's friend let us borrow his before we bought this one. We bought it used but the book is practically new. I'm studying to become a trainer and nutritionist so this book is really helpful.
B006M6GPMS|3.0|Not for everyone's taste and today probably not on most people's radar but entertaining and worth listening to. Some tunes and lyrics quite unique, typically ageless for the good songs.
030758836X|3.0|Book was good but the ending was ridiculous.  Don't buy.  Get it from the library or a friend if you want to read it.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|What a great story and human!<br /><br />I watched it 4x with different friends and they all loved it too!<br /><br />Would be great as a gift too.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This is my favorite Nicholas Spark's book.  He is usually not my favorite author but this was the best one I have read.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|For late 60's - timeless music.<br /><br />A cross between Dylan, Feliciano, Reed and probably a lot more - but his own style!<br /><br />So good - get the movie too to go with it!
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I like Judd Apatow's movies, but this one was simply too long and was not funny.  Would not recommend, did not laugh once.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|the best puzzle game out of this type. a great time killer.  just a great all around game . all fun
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it. Having the Bible handy on my Kindle is very good for me. I appreciate this app! Thanks a million!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I have to give it two thumbs up for how imaginative it is. This is a truly genius movie and I will personally have it as an all time favorite in my collection!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Now this is the Depeche Mode that I fell in love with!!!  Great album! Sorry my review isn't very long at the moment, I'm going back to listen to it again (I may or may not be back with a more in depth review)....
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I really love how you can get into this movie! The characters are well done and the animation is amazing.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This will leave you wanting more and more. Can't wait for the movie to come out to fall in love with Jace and Clary all over again....
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is the next Twilight series.  Wonderful writing.  Keeps one's interest. I also read the follow-up book, Beautiful Darkness.  Both very good.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Love a book that keeps you on the edge. Can't put it down. Loved this book waiting to read book three.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|The CD is excellent.  Came to my house very quickly and the whole CD has a great grown up sound.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|I'm not usually a gore-watcher, nor am I usually able to tolerate suspense well. However, I watched the pilot episode on the recommendation of a friend and have been *absolutely* hooked ever since. The characters and screenplay are compelling; the direction, well-done; and the plots/devices, extremely creative. I think what enables me to tolerate it is the outlandishness of the imaginative situations that create the gore. Plus, the ongoing storyline/backstory is super-complex and extremely creative. I found I like to read plot summaries of the episode, too, actually before I watch an episode. Some might not like this, but it not only helps me tolerate the suspense (hey, you gotta know yourself), but helps me keep the characters straight, especially as the seasons progress.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|While different than the comics the characters and storyline keep me glued to the monitor. Watch this it is worth it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good fun easy and free. First thing I chose. Always keeps the family happy, and me. Nice to have option of winning deal for younger children
0452289963|5.0|I read this before his first book, The Power of Now but it doesn't matter. It's wonderful as is the Power of Now. It can change your life!
0385349831|5.0|Paulo Coelho always surprises me. When I thought everything was done, he comes up with a new idea and releases this incredible new book. Structured through questions, the book is magnificent. As other Coelho's books, it takes you to another world and the story surrounds you in a beautiful way. You can't stop reading and you see yourself immersed in a charming but deep history. I couldn't stop reading!
B009NPKTN6|2.0|The movie is mostly awful but Tom Cruise steals every single scene. He characterized a fallen rock star to a tee.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|the best game ever!!<br />love playing it every day. I think the upgrade is more clearer than it was.<br />AWESOME TIMES A MILLION!!!
0425252868|5.0|This is a great story. You also get a German prospective of the air war in Europe. The book is well written and a easy read. It was tough to put down.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I'm not a huge Bond fan, but I heard great things about this one. After watching it, I'm still not a huge Bond fan. Some of the action is fun, but this movie is way too long and predictable.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The graphics are great. Not a game you can just sit and play. If you wish not to pay for things it takes time.
B0027MJU00|4.0|So many twists, kept me guessing and I couldn't put it down!  Would make a GREAT movie!!!!! Gillian Flynn is an incredible writer!!
B003MC5N28|5.0|I read this when I was twelve. Reading it 13 years later it still gives me chills. Great book to this day.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Great movie it very emotional I cried plenty of times must see wonderful I love the main character and Emma Watson's character!
0767020308|5.0|I loved this portrayal of Emma.  I also have the copy with Gwyneth Paltrow which is excellent, but this one is more in detail.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game reminds me of the Atari games. Good for game for all ages. Easy controlling on kindle fire. way to go developers
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I love anything Jane Austen.  Storyline was excellent and so was the acting. Sorry it didn't have closed captioning otherwise was happy with purchase.
B004H6G0TI|3.0|don&#34;t care for the way it controls on kindle fire. Sorry no longer have game to keep working on it. personally not good at this kind of game
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|The action is great plus the way the whole movie was written was exceptional.  I didn't expect M to die, she is such a great actress.  I also like the new Q very much too, his timing is great in his responses.  The bad guy did a wonderful job in being bad.  The of course Daniel Craig is another fine job as Bond.
B000003S5G|2.0|Never thought I would have the chance to get this album on vinyl. The presentation is really OK, the pressing is on 180 gram vinyl...but unfortunately some of the tracks has those  annoying &#34;skips&#34;. Really disappointed with this purchase, is not easy to find albums like this on vinyl. However, great album.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I enjoy how they make this TV series into much more than killing zombies and how to survive.  The dialogue between the actors about what is right or wrong is well written.  Plus I must mention the acting is superb, the actors know their craft very well.  I also enjoy how the character of Darrell is being portrayed.  The whole show is very well done and kudos to everyone involved.
B001GJ2ZP2|1.0|I think that 'The Fame' is a GREAT album, but my complaint is focused on the manufacturing of the record. My expectations were really high for this version, I was surprised that this vinyl  was still available. However, 8 of 13 songs were damaged, they had a LOT of skips. I tried playing the record in 3 different turntables and cleaning the object, but the problem was still there.<br />It's a shame that this version of this great album was ruined like this...
0425263916|5.0|\\"Reflected in You\\" was amazing. I loved this book more than the first. Eva, Gideon and Cary will definitely leave you wanting more after you read this book. There are surprises you won't see coming and you will see just how far Gideon is willing to go to protect Eva. There will be parts that will make you smile, laugh, hot & bothered, sad, frustrated but it will be worth every feeling your feeling at that moment. I am happy that in the ending Eva grew a backbone. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series. Author Sylvia Day has just gained another fan. \\"Reflected in You\\" is a must read and I highly recommend this book to anyone 18+ looking for a good romance with a lot of drama.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very addictive and very fun. Love Sid an  what he  has to say during the level ups. Love this game!
1616550414|5.0|I LOVE this book. I waited about a year for it to come out in the states and Amazon sent me a copy as soon as it was available. I read the whole thing cover to cover in one sitting. Everything you have ever want to know about Zelda characters and and history and chock full of kick ass art!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This latest Lee Child/Jack Reacher novel at least answered some questions left cliff-hanging in the previous book, and it did have a convoluted plot twist that wasn't so mysterious that the typical Jack Reacher fan couldn't figure out before the end of the book.  Overall, the series is getting less and less intriguing, but still readable.<br /><br />O/T:  I might add that I ABHOR the recent collaboration (or whatever one cares to call it) with Diane Capri where that author borrows the Jack Reacher character to build a parallel plot line around.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I love this movie, however The picture quality was not good, I rented this on my wii, but also, even on my netbook the picture was not good
B0046ECFRM|4.0|That is a LOT to me.  If, at the end, I still love the main characters, it is a great thing.  A little 'expected' in terms of outcome, but I loved the sassiness.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|I love this movie. No loud bangs and blow ups! No drawn out speed chases. I am so tired of that genre of movies. If you want to enjoy a movie that has a story about life, without being over dramatized; you will really enjoy this movie.
B00BN4R7LC|3.0|I actually wanted to see this movie mainly for the cinematography; it used a new digital camera (Viper Filmstream) for the first time in a major movie and was able to capture the night scenes at a very low light level for dramatic effects. The scene where the coyote walks across the road is an example of something which would not ever be possible on film. Cool.<br /><br />As for the plot and story line, typical Hollywood dreck focussed on every director's most admired type of person - the highly professional killer. That's right, not Mother Theresa, but the highly professional killer. I have never liked Tom Cruise, who has the depth, imagination and sense of humor of a stone, but I suppose he plays a good h-p-k. Yawn.<br /><br />Towards the end of the movie there are the inevitable 'philosophy of life' musings where the director inserts 'deep self reflection' about the existential angst of the highly-professional-killer lifestyle. Quite laughable. Advice to Hollywood deep thinkers: Stick to the car chases!
B006OAB2XO|5.0|This album was all I had expected and then some! Grimes blends a beautiful mixture of unique power-pop vocals and melodic digital sounds, creating a spirit moving sonic experience for listeners. I highly recommend purchasing this album as I feel that it is one of the best records I have heard in the last 10 to 15 years!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its just like temple run just more colorful and fun. cooler people too. also subway suffers world tour is fun because the background changes every month.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I am addicted to Mahjong and always looking for a new app.  This one works very well, animations are great, games vary in degree of challenge, and it is easy to use.  Love this one.
B004G6TD66|5.0|I loved ELP in high school and college and even saw them live a couple of times.  While all are stand out artists in their respective areas Keith Emerson is an extraordinary keyboard musician; pretty amazing to this day to have a trio with no lead guitar (generally...Greg Lake is an excellent guitarists but generally played bass) which uses keyboards as the lead instrument!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I was having foot surgery and decided to buy this DVD to watch during my recovery.  Once I put in the first DVD, it became a Downton Abbey marathon.  I couldn't wait for the next installment.  This was an amazing production and although rather expensive, well worth the price.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Good old School game. Like the old Galaxia game.<br />Well made game, reminded me of games from my youth. z
B002DEI4NG|5.0|love the series wish it was still on television very entertaining. will order more of the series as i can afford it
B00846WWVM|4.0|Cool concept for a game.<br />You are required to put out fires by aiming the firehose.<br />Graphics are good and boards can be challenging.
1616550414|5.0|I saw this in the bookstore the other day and wow. It is very impressive, I want to get it for my boy who loves this series. It is a very large book, make room on your shelf for this one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best new zombie show/movie in years.  It's unbelievably tense, and has both character development and zombie carnage.  A must-see if you've ever been a zombie fan.
B00AUU2KI0|5.0|I loved Martel's incredible talent for description -- it makes the reader feel as if he/she is shipwrecked with Pi, and of course Richard Parker.
B00447G29S|5.0|I had the DVD 3D version of this film with the red and blue paper glasses and the 3D was horrible, unwatchable actually. I read reviews that the blu ray version was well done and purchased this to replace the DVD. It is very nice. The picture and sound quality are near perfect and it is a wonderful film.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great read! It put things in perspective for me. Chris is a true American hero! You should take the time to read this book.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|I didn't really have high expectations for this movie. But, it was a great movie. I really enjoyed it. Nice storyline, held my interest and was just the right length!
0812982622|2.0|Orphan Master's Son was the most depressing book I have ever read.  Although I got it for a book club read, I could not finish it because it made me feel just terrible.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|This was a nice story with a good lesson. I am not sure if it would hold the interest of a younger child but as an adult, I really liked it.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This digital download stopped working half way through the movie and kept saying: video unavailable.<br />There is no where on Amazon.com to report a problem or get your money back when there is an issue with a video playing.<br />I had great internet connection and tried on several different devices to continue watching it.<br />Now my 48 time period expired and I wasted money without getting to finish the movie.<br />Get this fixed and have an option to contact Amazon with issues regarding digital downloads!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I wouldn't agree that this was the funniest movie in years but it was watchable and did have funny moments. Glad I didn't pay to see it in theaters but not a bad movie to rent and watch at home.
B000093BDX|5.0|Very nice CD. There are alot of the Beach Boys hits on this disc from early to present. If you would like a nice selection of songs and are not looking to spend alot of money, this might be the CD for you.
B000BVMAJ2|3.0|There isn't much to this set. I got this for my son when he turned one. He likes the animals but there isn't much else to it. The blocks are still kind of small for him and he is 18 months old now. He definitely enjoys playing with his mega blocks more.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Important information for building relationships of any kind but especially applies to a happy successful marriage or loving nurturing relationship.
B00540G3G6|5.0|I was a little worried about the 3D quality of this movie. I read some of the reviews and decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. My husband and I both love the movie and the 3D was and picture quality in general was fabulous.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game! :) not light at all. I wish h the items were a little bit cheaper but other than that an awesome, fun, and overall entertaining game.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I wanted to read this before watching the movie and it was a good book. I enjoyed it and enjoyed the movie. The movie followed the storyline in the book very closely.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I actually hadn't seen this movie myself, but I knew all the songs in it from being a voice teacher. It is now one of my 3 year olds favourites!!! It is very cute!!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My husband loves this movie so I bought it for him for his birthday. We have a 3D TV so I purchased the 3D version. The 3D is nice and clear there was only one spot in the movie where I can recall it being a bit fuzzy. Plus this was just a really nice, cute movie. Highly recommend.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I used to love this movie when I was a 3 year old and had the tape and my Fischer Price tape recorder to play it on. I used to stand in front of my grandmothers picture window red curtains and sing along with every word. I got this for my 3 year old and she is now doing the same (plus not that it's on TV, she acts it out too)! Very fun to watch!! She loves it!
B003V1WTMM|5.0|This is the second Kate Morton book I have read and I admit that I am hooked. I read House at Riverton and loved it. These are simple stories with complex character that take you back to another time. I purchased the Secret Keeper after reading this and it is next in my queue. Would recommend any Kate Morton book!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Really enjoyed this fun app. Could have had more options to get more coins faster,but that's how they get the ads in
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Disney/Pixar creates another great movie. This was a very good movie. The perfect amount of laughs, action and life lessons. I really enjoyed it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book seemed really strange to me.  The characters were just weird.  The story was unbelieveable.  I kept hoping it would get better but even the ending left me really hanging in limbo.  I would not recommend this book.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|My wife and I love this show. Now, we bought this because our internet was down, but what I normally recommend is to watch these online for free on your laptop or run an HDMI cord from your computer to your TV. That way you can enjoy your favorite show on the big screen for free.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Mary Poppins is a classic.  I have it on VHS but ordered the DVD to give to my granddaughter for her birthday as she said she had never seen it.  The music, the story, the acting, the animation - it's all excellent.  The movie won all kinds of  awards. It is timeless and is just as enjoyable by the whole family today as it was when it was first released. I always felt that Dick Van Dyke should have won the Oscar for his role. He is amazing.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is a great series - Google it. The internet believes it to be good! It's even better in BluRay. It's like putting bacon on your bacon - or having HD bacon! Anyways, buy this, love this, and become a better person.<br /><br />Quality is awesome, audio is awesome, series is awesome.
0802473156|5.0|I asked my husband to do the love quiz and boy was it right on.  Unfortunately we are at an impass in our relationship and well.... anyway, the insights in this book are very revealing.

1476734941|5.0|I am entering my fourth week of following the FastDiet plan and I have to say that it works!  I have lost 8 lbs. &#34;effortlessly&#34;.  Before I started this &#34;diet&#34; (I really don't feel like I'm on a &#34;diet&#34; though) I ran it by my doctor at my annual visit.  Although she had reservations that a diet like this was not &#34;sustainable&#34; she approved it when she heard you can have 500 calories per day. I only find the time between dinner and bedtime difficult to get through.  The rest of the day is truly easy.  Like previous reviewers said, just a cup of tea or other non-calorie beverage puts the hunger pangs to rest.  As soon as the weather improves I'm going to add daily walking to my schedule and I anticipate even better results.  I would definitely recommend buying the book.  I found it motivating and inspiring.  I would NOT listen to those who think it's not necessary (unless you're a &#34;know it all&#34; who delights in blasting others.)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was full of suspense and romance. Its definitely one of my top favorites!!!! Great!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|ive seen my sister play draw something it kind of looks fun I'm not so sure I will try it.  &lt;3.  &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; I can make a guy ridind a skateboard ol-&lt; : see *******&#9733;
B00BESKTMG|1.0|It has a good concept, but Ja Rule's acting is so bad that it spoils the film. Also, hip hop and rapping background music totally takes you out of the experience of the film. The directing was also bad, even for a kung fu genre movie.  A different lead actor and better direction and get rid of the hip hop music and you have a reasonably good kung fu movie.
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|Thank you for the last memory with my Mom<br /> She passed away a few weeks after our last concert. Cleveland rocks.
1616550414|5.0|the book is excellent in many ways, from it's contents to it's workmanship. This book will tend to go at high values in market over the time, buy yours now before it become expensive.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|Need to be a hardcore Jimi fan to like it a lot.  Some great insights to work he never released.  Or maybe he never wanted it released.
B0058BI896|5.0|I am a sick, sick person.  I watched this entire season in one day.  Seriously.  I need help.  I'm not crazy, though.  Mother had me tested.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The pain of growing up is offset with the author's use of flowers and brings about a satisfying conclusion to the central character's life.  A thoroughly engaging novel.
0988936402|5.0|Throw together a not quite human Keeper in a place that is between here and there, in a time frame of yesterday and another day, include a race of Frons who are neither human nor animal, a cute little furry creature with large ears like a mouse, and stir in trouble in the forms of other worldly creatures, a few giants, eight worlds that are becoming more negative as time passes, and then Owen Sage, this young college Freshman, who is supposed to save this other world, and still attend college with his best friends, Dante and Anika.  Now you have a great mirror reflecting the colorful imagination of the author as he draws out this story for you.  This is good sci fi particularly appealing to the YA genre.  The typos, grammatical errors, and wrong words complained about in former reviews have been fixed through a concerted effort of a new publishing company.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Landay keeps the reader engaged with his storytelling.  The book is well written and the characters are engaging.  And of course the surprise at the end makes you nod your head with the outfcome.
B0039Q7QKE|3.0|I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and I've been a bit disappointed by the finish of  the badge. She was still happy, and it does look good if you don't look on the details, but one could tend to expect more from a licensed product.<br /><br />And I'm not convinced by the double pin attach. A brooch type attach would have looked better, have made it look a bit more &#34;real&#34; and be more secure if equipped with a security fastener. But I'm just nitpicking on this matter.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Not only did the plane crash, but the plot as well!  Denzel Washington is a fantastic actor but this storyline just didn't serve him well.  The plot was predictable and a disappointment!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Gripping plot and good actors! Would definitely recommend it. Other than that, I think the Academy award speaks for itself :)
B004JK61K0|3.0|I only downloaded this because Amazon's troubleshooter asked me to because I was having trouble setting up my email, it did not solve my problem and had to take other steps to solve the problem.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show is so much more than just killing zombies.  It gives a glimpse into how things will be when it all goes to Hell in a handbasket.  It is actually quite eye opening to the human condition and how we will either choose to be sheep or step out and fight against evil.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|It was much closer to the book. I was surprised by the portions they cut out, parts that pertain to the story line.
B003F3PMYI|4.0|I would buy this again. I've read it twice and find it so easy to breeze through I'm wondering what all I've learned. But it's staying with me and I'm considering buying it for co-workers. My husband is reading it this time around.
B002M9FWQE|5.0|I love all of the songs on this album. They can be happy or sad, but they're always enjoyable! I will always be buying Mika's music!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The quality of the DVD was great! And, of course the show is one of my favorites! Classy, fun, interesting and portrays how many lives were changed by World War I. The costumes and decor give much by way of historical interest.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|When I received the review request from St. Martin's Press, as I always do, I popped over to Goodreads and Amazon to read the synopsis and take a closer look at the author. Had I gone by the blurb on Goodreads (the one shown above), I may have passed this book up.  It was what I saw on Amazon that had me anxious to read Eleanor & Park:<br /><br />  Bono met his wife in high school, Park says.<br />  So did Jerry Lee Lewis, Eleanor answers.<br />  I'm not kidding, he says.<br />  You should be, she says, we're 16.<br />  What about Romeo and Juliet?<br />  Shallow, confused, then dead.<br />  I love you, Park says.<br />  Wherefore art thou, Eleanor answers.<br />  I'm not kidding, he says.<br />  You should be.<br />  Set over the course of one school year in 1986, this is the story of two star-crossed misfits--smart enough to know that first love almost never lasts, but brave and desperate enough to try. When Eleanor meets Park, you'll remember your own first love--and just how hard it pulled you under.<br /><br />It was the banter between these two that I found intriguing.  Plus, I am a product of the eighties...if I thought I could get away with it, I would probably still where my hair in some ridiculous angular cut.  Okay, not really but you will still find me lovingly listening to \\"new wave\\" music while I clean my house.  Anyway, what I'm saying is the book seamed like something I would like.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />This book is something that I loved.<br /><br />When I read on my Kindle, I highlight all the bits I want to remember for when I write my review.  There are usually a handful.  If you peak at my Eleanor & Park file there is yellow all over the place.  There is so much good stuff here, it has it all.<br /><br />Eleanor has a rough life and that is putting it mildly.  After a year of couch surfing she's brought back home to live with her mother, her four younger siblings and her creeper stepfather.  She has to share a room with all her brothers and sisters, there is no door on the bathroom, almost all of her possessions were thrown out while she was gone and her mother can't even remember to buy Eleanor her own toothbrush.  To say she is an awkward outcast with fluffy red hair and a ridiculous wardrobe would be an understatement.<br /><br />Park is the only (half) Asian kid in the area.  He's not sure where he fits in and no one else really seems to know either.  He's not a pariah at school but he is somewhat on the outskirts of the 'in crowd' and is careful to not be completely pushed to the outer limits.<br /><br />This unlikely pair is forced to sit together on the bus but don't talk or acknowledge each other for weeks. Yet a relationship, a bond, forms between them that is undeniable and utterly heart oozing sweet.  When they first interact and become more than two strangers simultaneously riding a bus, watch out because all the warm fuzzies will be spreading from your ears to your toes.  The first hand holding is to die for cute.<br /><br />  \\"Holding Eleanor's hand was like holding a butterfly. Or a heartbeat. Like holding something complete and completely alive.\\"<br /><br />  \\"If you've ever wondered what that feels like, it's a lot like melting - but more violent.\\"<br /><br />As the relationship develops, so do the insecurities that Eleanor and Park both harbor and so do the secrets of Eleanor's home life and struggle with girls at school.  It is the love that these two feel for each other that carry them through each day and living without each other becomes something of an impossibility.<br /><br />The exchanges between these two is nothing less than adorable and their inner monologues are even better.<br /><br />  \\"She sat completely still because she didn't have any other option. She tried to remember what kind of animals paralyzed their prey before they ate them... Maybe Park had paralyzed her with his ninja magic, his Vulcan handhold, and now he was going to eat her.  That would be awesome.\\"<br /><br />This started out as such a quirky and fun story, I often found myself giggling aloud.  As the story became more intimate and serious, it began to tug at my heart and with one absolute 'mom moment', I was reduced to tears.  Not something I do regularly with books.<br /><br />I won't lie and tell you this a super feel good HEA type of book.  It has many super feel good moments but the crux of the story is more profound and questions the power of love - what it makes you do - and what you are willing to give up to hold on to it.<br /><br />Now, I have recently berated a book for having an untidy ending.  Eleanor & Park's ending leaves a lot to the imagination as well. But, I think this ending works and I'll explain why.<br /><br />First, this is a standalone book. I have not invested hours upon hours developing deep emotions for the story, nor have I spent years waiting and wondering what is going to happen next and how it is going to end.  Second, these are teens experiencing their first love, the kind of love that your heart hurts when you are away from the person for an hour. The type of love that stays with you in your heart forever, even if the relationship itself doesn't last. When you're young you think everything will last forever and always be as perfect as it is now. It's not reality. Life gets in the way, growth gets in the way.  In my head, this ending was reminiscent of that sort of love and it was quite fitting.  Others may not agree.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a first love, somewhat coming of age type story or someone like me who loves the nostalgic feelings that can't help but surface when reading about young love in the age of your own teen years.me.\\"<br /><br />This started out as such a quirky and fun story, I often found myself giggling aloud.

Not really a con.<br /><br />--- Thoughts ---<br />* I've used this stuff for years and never had a reason not to use it.<br />* If you've had a laptop for a couple years and it's possible, consider replacing paste with this stuff. That old crusty hard cheap stuff won't last.
B006LSZECO|5.0|amazing, skilled character development<br />recommended to a friend who could not put this book down and neither could I<br />I love it when a read has no idea where the author is taking you
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|I watch lots of streaming movies, using Roku. Everything works great for movies, but I just tried to view the new James Bond movie, SkyFall, via Amazon, and it was delivered like a piece of crap. It pauses, stops, goes to blank screen, repeatedly.  It's not my internet connection...  I have ultra high speed internet. No bandwidth problem here. This never happens with any of the other streaming movie providers I use...  I guess I just wasted five bucks on a movie I really wanted to see.  Guess I will just restrict my movie viewing to the trusted and true &#34;cheaper&#34; providers.  Amazon sucks big time!  Don't waste your money.  I won't be using Amazon movie streaming again.  You would think they would have this figured out...but apparently not.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I read the John Carter books many years ago and loved them.  I was looking forward to the movie but it disappeared from the cinemas here in Australia before I got a chance to see it (I live 2 hours from another town with a cinema so that just sucks). I grabbed it as soon as it came out on DVD and LOVED it.  This movie not only met all my expectations, it exceeded them.  The actors were the characters and the images were better than I imagined them years before.  I so want to revisit Barsoom.  I had heard about the possibility of a sequel and if that happens I will definitely be getting to a cinema and laying my money down, probably several times, because this is a movie I really wanted to see on the big screen and a sequel would make my day and give me the chance to see John, Dejah and co up there in all their glory.  I can't recommend this movie highly enough and I am hoping that Disney notices how well they are doing and take us back to Barsoom. Please, pretty please!

B008J34466|5.0|Basically, if you're a P!nk fan, you'll enjoy this album.  Same great voice, similar format (a few catchy tunes, some sadder songs and ballads, a few real gems peppered in, etc.), and an album you can listen to start to finish.  My personal favorite songs on the album are \\"The Great Escape\\" and \\"Beam Me Up\\", but there are several others that are great, as well.

I enjoyed the characters, the writing, the twists, but how on earth could police not look into a locked freezer in a victim's cabin. They dragged the lake, but didn't open a door?  What???  So, ten years later our hero discovers a body of a missing policeman.  No, No, No.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|An amazing true story that will inspire you to live your life just a bit better, if you can. I grew up in the 50's and remember those feelings that the author explains about &#34;the enemy&#34; -- Germans, all of them, not discriminating between Nazis and people who had a higher calling and didn't cave in to the evil. To read this book was to learn how limited my exposure to some of the history of WWII had been. Highly recommended for people who enjoy reading history or WWII books or want to be inspired by a man who rose above it all.

B001EPB0JU|4.0|Worldbeat is a music genre that primarily refers to a blending of Western pop music and/or rock music with traditional/folk or world music influences - but that usually means a neutered version of the traditional sound. This is the sound of 21st Century. A good companion to the more street sound of M.I.A.

1400069742|5.0|[[ASIN:B00C17RV7K Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh, and America's Fight Over World War II, 1939-1941]]<br /><br />THOSE ANGRY DAYS<br />Roosevelt, Lindbergh and America's<br />Fight Over World War II, 1939 - 1941<br />By Lynne Olson<br /><br />This Tome covers the above period and beyond, in which before a shooting war was declared, the antagonists, Charles Lindbergh and FDR, attacked issues, each other (though the both often indirectly), in an unmatched war of words which about sawed America in half like two vaudeville magicians, over a struggle of either rescuing Great Britain, (and the rest of the world) or becoming inactive voyeurs staying out of the way of Nazi Germany's Imperialistic acquisition of nation collecting, slaughter, anti-Semitism, torture and mass murder and destruction.<br /><br />The story begins as \\"on a soft April morning in 1939\\" upon which FDR had summoned the Isolationist Charles Lindbergh to the White House for a chat, and FDR was chummy and his usual charming self, but which neither he nor his guest spoke of the real reason for the meeting, in the wake of which millions of others, with each new verbal attack, took sides either as Isolationists or Interventionists.<br /><br />Over the next nearly three years, the war of words got hotter and more personal, and became a part of one of the most vitriolic political campaigns in our history, which all but tore asunder any unity the nation may have had over the issues at hand.<br /><br />Germany was rapidly advancing, carving up nations at such a furious pace that many were convinced that the Third Reich was unstoppable. The idea that allowing Germany, which many warned would attack and convert South America with little interference as at that time so many German residents living there, America would be an easy and solitary sitting duck for attack and certain of losing control of the Panama Canal, would leave America an isolated island surrounded by Hitler's European conquests in the west and Japan's in the East, America would be doomed. All of which reminds me of how stupid or liars some politicians were and remain.<br /><br />Over the course of the verbal battle, myriad organizations were created by the Brits, the Fascists/Nazi's, Conservative, Liberals, Corporations, Nazi sympathizers, German/Americans, Jews as well as anti-Semites, and movie makers, arms makers, bankers, news papers and many others, to lobby for their cause.<br /><br />If one has lived through, and/or participated in wars, and political battles, or was merely observing the nastiness of some presidential races and arguments about whether to declare wars, or not, over the last seventy three years, one could get some idea of the magnitude of anger that was shaking the nation because of the possibility of perhaps engaging in another war within twenty plus years of \\"The Great War, The War To End All Wars\\".<br /><br />In that First World War some 17 million lives were lost, and 22 million were wounded. In the war that followed, the then the coming war, with more modern, sophisticated weaponry would cost, according to recent research counting both civilian and military, 66 million - 80 million lives.<br /><br />As the war of words accelerated, German propagandists, lobbyists and spies, and their British/American counterparts, ratcheted up the name calling (war monger, Socialist, vs. Nazi/fascist, etc.), and well known literary celebrities meeting in private clubs have at each other, as Lindbergh's speeches sounded more and more Anti-Semitic, Roosevelt found his temper at a boiling point driving his Blood Pressure to new heights occasionally sending him to bed for days.<br /><br />In the congress, if dueling were still legal one gets the impression that the two houses would be rife with Scaramouch's. Investigations seeking to expose and indict Nazi, Communist, union, corporate and other spies are attempted, most of which fail to do much more than anger everyone else, and one begins to seethe earliest stages of what would become the McCarthy insanity.<br /><br />Seeking peace and solace first from fame, in his early years of celebrity, and then from infamy, the Lindbergh's move about quite a bit especially after some of his more bigoted sounding rants, in which he seems to ignore the war criminal exploits of Hitler, and appears to lack any empathy whatsoever, his wife begins to feel uncomfortable in trying to defend him and o senses early on how long this marriage will last.<br /><br />Meanwhile Roosevelt, still stinging from one of his few defeats, in which in his previous presidency he attempted to pack the Supreme Court, for rejecting what they saw as his unconstitutional offerings, seemed for the first time not to lead but to follow public opinion, as a desperate Winston Churchill tried everything in his power to induce FDR to declare war on Germany or at least send weaponry help, which led to the ingenious Roosevelt idea of \\"Lend Lease\\" which offered some pittance of help, as those who formed the Interventionist movements as well as  often more than 70% - 75% of the citizenry were several moves ahead of the White House in wanting to go to war, or at least sending more ordinance to Britain and even to Russia.<br /><br />At any rate, as Roosevelt faces his toughest opponent in the election of 1940, Wendell Willkie, he is pleased to see the brilliant Willkie agrees with him as an interventionist. Though the race appears tight and bitterly fought, FDR wins by more than five million votes, but with Willkie gaining the most votes an FDR challenger ever attained.<br /><br />Throughout the reading, though one knows well the ultimate outcome one can feel the stress of FDR as well as the Lindbergh family. Mrs. Lindberg's mother is an interventionist, though her son in law is an Isolationist. As time goes on and Lindbergh's speeches become more suspiciously like those of the leaders of the Third Reich, the couple looses many of their closest friends.<br /><br />Though I have read since graduate school more than 10,000 pages of FDR and WW II, and written several reviews on the subject of the New Deal and WW II, as well as a few books on Charles Lindbergh, I learned things about both FDR and Lindbergh I never before encountered.<br /><br />I will stop here so as not to damage the suspense or give away key pints beyond what you need to know to also be surprised at certain issues and how they played out. Thus in bringing this review to a close I would have to say that overall this was a thrilling read and the only real problem I encountered was that towards the last third of the book, the back and forth concerning FDR's lollygagging on the issue of deciding to help our allies, and the uprisings of the Isolationists, and the overcoming of them by the interventionist, dragged on, and on, and on with little difference between one \\"crisis\\" and the next. Since I have an advance Unedited Proof Reviewers copy I can only hope that in the final editing process that, the only slow down boring aspect of the book was reduced.<br /><br />I give the book 4.25 stars, which because there are no fractions will still come out to be 5 stars.the earliest stages of what would become the McCarthy insanity.<br /><br />Seeking peace and solace first from fame, in his early years of celebrity, and then from infamy, the Lindbergh's move about quite a bit especially after some of his more bigoted sounding rants, in which he seems to ignore the war criminal exploits of Hitler, and appears to lack any empathy whatsoever, his wife begins to feel uncomfortable in trying to defend him and o senses early on how long this marriage will last.<br /><br />Meanwhile Roosevelt, still stinging from one of his few defeats, in which in his previous presidency he attempted to pack the Supreme Court, for rejecting what they saw as his unconstitutional offerings, seemed for the first time not to lead but to follow public opinion, as a desperate Winston Churchill tried everything in his power to induce FDR to declare war on Germany or at least send weaponry help, which led to the ingenious Roosevelt idea of \\"Lend Lease\\" which offered some pittance of help, as those who formed the Interventionist movements as well as  often more than 70% - 75% of the citizenry were several moves ahead of the White House in wanting to go to war, or at least sending more ordinance to Britain and even to Russia.<br /><br />At any rate, as Roosevelt faces his toughest opponent in the election of 1940, Wendell Willkie, he is pleased to see the brilliant Willkie agrees with him as an interventionist.

B008VBSR9G|5.0|I love this album.  All the tracks are so Cher.  I can't wait for her to make a new one!
B009SSGBOE|4.0|This should be obvious to anyone who is a big Steely Dan fan that Donald Fagen, who is the voice of that 70's rock fusion band, any of his solo works will sound just like a modern Steely Dan album.  This is never a bad thing because you really want to hear Fagen's voice.<br /><br />I compare all of his solo albums to his first, &#34;The Nightfly&#34; which was highly commercial in production and sound.  &#34;Morph The Cat&#34; takes second place and this latest effort falls slightly below into 3rd place.  It still needs more time to grow on me, so it might move up into that second place spot.
0385349831|4.0|While I was browsing Barnes and Noble this past weekend, I noticed this book on a newly-arrived table and with much excitement and a surprise, I read it right there and then. As it turns out, it was fairly a short read. The spacing within this book makes it so that one can read up to five or so pages before another chapter reveals itself. But, each chapter would prompts one to stop and ponder on the meanings contained in the previous chapter.<br /><br />It is not like his other works, in a sense of being a \\"novel\\" but more like a philosophic/spiritual teachings and lectures about how to live life, from the words of a spiritual man called \\"The Copt\\" in 1099 at the city of Jerusalem on the eve before the Crusades. It's basically a question-answer platform - the various townspeople (mixed of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim living peacefully together) gather around Copt while he shares his \\"wisdom\\" about everything: love, anxiety, loyalty, nature, sex, etc.<br /><br />Personally, it has that similar flavor to Khalil Gibran's works - not only that, it really does follow the similar pattern of one of author's previous books, [[ASIN:0060527986 Warrior of the Light: A Manual]].<br /><br />Some of the \\"sayings\\" in this book are interesting, to say the least. Overall, it didn't have much in a way of new insights - it's felt like a re-telling of old wisdom and what have you (for those of us whom are well-endowed with profound readings of ancient works). But, it can be important for this day and age.<br /><br />I personally loved his previous novels, especially [[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]], [[ASIN:0060528001 The Devil and Miss Prym]], and [[ASIN:0061338818 The Witch of Portobello]]. And, this latest work by Coelho sure can be quite an insightful read.
B0087EACJK|4.0|sorry, for some reason amazon won't let me use caps today. cool idea, good faotd. i actually bought this not long ago. i would say it's ok, but i don't love it. i feel like not much is added to keep it interesting. that along with the very basic graphics makes it a bit slow. but very unique game.

B000KIPT30|4.0|I just received this headphone amp in the mail today. I have this hooked up to my Behringer Xenyx 302 usb mixer. My main purpose of this amp is to have my headphones powered. I have noticed my cheaper sets of headphones require more power to drive than my more expensive ones. I did not notice any loss in sound quality with this amp and I heard no distortion at high volumes. The power supply stays in tight with the unit and does not feel loose.  The knobs feel fairly decent and the build quality of amp is very rugged.  For the price you can not go wrong with the Behringer MicroAmp HA400
B005LAIHZY|3.0|I thought this movie was good, didn't put me a sleep but to say that it was a movie that left me awestruck would be a stretch. But my wife liked it and my boys liked it so not a bad family night movie

B00A2LOAKI|5.0|I'm a huge comic book geek and Batman is my all-time favorite. I was excited when I heard that this movie was being made cause I love the source material. I think they nailed the comic in all parts. It is a must buy
B00A85EMVK|5.0|I got this for 19.99 ordering before the release date and could not be happier. It can't quite match the IMAX 3D experience but I certainly didn't expect it to. That's not to say the 3D doesn't look great though. Not as much depth as modern 3D movies, but the Aerial combat scenes definitely benefit from the 3D transition. One thing to note is that the 2D version is not a remastered version of the film as well. It's the 2D version that has been out for  quite a while. Still looks great but it would have been nice to have a new 2D remaster as well. Children of the eighties unite....buy this movie : )
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie became one of my favorite Disney animated movies of all time, great for adults and great for kids

I even gave this CD as a gift.  Well worth sitting back with your feet up and listening to his voice take you away from the day's misery.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.
B000IMKDPC|5.0|It is very exciting a good start for all the ones to follow. Never gets old. Will see ovef and over
B0098OLMDS|5.0|interesting book that covers the history of the oil industry, showing the development of modern industry and some of the largest companies in the world today. has quite a heavy focus on weaving in the politics and personalities of the times.<br />i'm not sure if it's just my personal interest in the industry as well as politics etc, but this is definitely the most interesting history book i've ever read.
B009439HEY|5.0|Steve Hackett does Genesis better than Genesis!  A perfect collection of covers by the only original member of Genesis still doing Genesis.  Can-Utility and the Coastliners featuring Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree is a standout.  And where can you hear Supper's Ready and Dancing Out With The Moonklit Knight on the same release?  From beginning to end a fantastic recording.  You will not regret buying this 2 CD release!!!

0316056898|3.0|I love Tina Fey but I think her humor is best captured on film and television. Her jokey style fell flat for me which I thought was strange given her prowess as a comedic writer. Maybe she is better at writing something that has someone else to play off of.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I'ts a little to fast moving for me.<br /><br />it is a game that requiremore hand movement than I can give it
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this after the movie came out. I haven't seen the movie but I kept seeing the actors faces while I was reading.

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Fun movie. Good action. Probably better on a theater (big) screen. I am always surprised they keep coming up with good JB story lines after 50 years.
B000002V1D|5.0|This is my favorite Duran Duran album, my fave Duran Duran song is &#34;Come Undone&#34; oh my Gods the guys are still sexy! I love 80's and they are one of my favorites!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I enjoyed this book although it was quite different than I expected. It had a science fiction bent and I do not like science fiction so would not read others in the series. If you like science fiction I think you would love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE IT! I bet you would too. Go on and get today it is available for most hand held devices!!!!!!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I got two of these.  I got one for using on a old USR 56K Modem for faxing and the other I got to connect between my system and a Tandy Color Computer 3 using DriveWire 4 Server.<br /><br />So far both are working great and doing the jobs that are needed.<br /><br />No complains.

B0081336FO|5.0|This is as great adaptation to Sherlock Holmes with a modern twist!  Any Holmes fan will love it.  Highly recommended.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love well written, smart, surprising science fiction, and this fits the bill thoroughly. The world of the silo and the people in it are rendered in all the complex, wonderful imperfection you'd expect from a master fiction writer. This book had me on the edge of my mental seat over and over. I found myself, at times, putting the book down only to delay reading the last page. I delighted in guessing ahead but was just as happy when the author sent me around a blind curve. Kudos to Hugh Howey for crafting this story, I will recommending it to all my friends as a very smart read, a mystery set in a post-apocalyptic dystopia... what could be tastier than that?
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I watched this part and I can not wait for the part 2 I have ordered.  I hope it gets here soon.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I wasn't sure of the hype. This has been a popular game for a long time, but is it really all that? Yes. While it isn't the greatest game I've ever played, it is a very fun game.
1476733953|3.0|In \\"Wool\\" , Howley visits a tired sci-fi cliche and breathes a little new life into it.  Like Lucas's THX-1138, Dick's The Penultimate Truth, and The City of Ember (to name just a few) \\"Wool\\" takes place in a underground complex built after the surface world becomes too toxic to survive in.  The plot is well constructed and the characters are fleshed out a bit, but the writing is average at best.  In a way, it reminds me of something that Michael Crichton might have written.  Like anything written by Crichton (who I've always felt was horribly overrated), this is a book that will make a better movie.
B005LAIHE0|2.0|I love both Blunt and Segel, and the funny trailers made me excited to see a fun (and not cheesy!) romantic comedy. But the movie was such a big let-down. Aside from a chuckle here and there, I really didn't find it funny at all. Rather than the playful comedy I expected, this is a dark, depressing take on how couples make sacrifices and resent their partners when those choices leave them unsatisfied. I am so glad that I did not pay $$ to see this in the theater.
B007SGM084|5.0|All I can say is WOW!<br /><br />Yes there are a lot of wild scenes but the story line is awesome.<br />I would highly recommend this book.
B0031Q0XCA|2.0|I really, REALLY like Zooey Deschanel.  This movie, however, is not a good vehicle for her.  She plays her usual charmingly goofy character, but I never really felt that I particularly cared for her.  This is really unusual for her.  The movie starts with a disclamer warning that it is NOT a love story.  Indeed it isn't.  There is great potential for a really satisfying love story, but Zooey's characater continually shoots that process down.  In the end, it is really maddening and, despite the disclamer, I felt really frustrated and cheated.  All in all, the movie really doesn't have much going for it.  It's a downer without anything in the way of redeeming qualities.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|This speaks for itself. For those of you who are Dr. Who fans, it is a must for the collection.<br />I think Matt Smith is a great Dr. Who.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|It's a bit of a screwball action comedy with a great cast and a very entertaining story line.  I was fully engrossed and highly entertained throughout.  I hope there will be a sequel.  I recommend it highly if you like action-comedy flicks with wonderful mature actors.  But, it's not only old-timers......Mary Louise Parker is a real cutie in this movie....a very welcome addition.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Wow, this book sure has gotten a lot of attention and reviews.  Not all good, I might add.  I think this was a really good story.  Definitely dysfunctional and unhealthy in parts, but overall, I will say that it is an amazing love story.  I kept from reading this because of the reviews that \\"claimed\\" this book to be abusive.  Well, Uh, No?!  Yes, there is a male CHARACTER that has anger issues.  In the book, he actually works on it.  The female CHARACTER is a little codependent.  And she also works on herself in the book.  (Notice they are CHARACTERS in a book!)  But, the love story is one that is so strong and incredible to follow.  There are other things in this book that will surprise you.  Like I said, I kept away from this book because of the same reasons I wrote above, but after picking the book up and actually making myself start reading it, I couldn't put it down!  I read this in less than a day.  And that is seriously saying something!<br /><br />I love how Jamie wrote this book.  In all reality, it would seem that Jamie herself either experienced something to this story, knows of someone who did or REALLY did some research.  Because I \\"have\\" been in and seen something very close to this type relationship and it can be extremely destructive.  But overall, this book was very well written and I am looking forward to seeing what else Jamie can come up with in other books.<br /><br />Yes, I do recommend this book.  HOWEVER, I do NOT recommend this book for anyone under the age of 18 to read it!!!!  This is for adults only.
B006ZZANFG|5.0|Amazing all around.  Great CD and DVD, plus the actual case is pretty cool, too.  5 more words required....oh yeah.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I tried this series after reading a story about the author in the Wall Street Journal concerning his success in bucking the big publishing houses and retaining the digital rights to his work.<br /><br />The story is excellent and the characters are well developed. It isa different plot and it just continues to evolve. I look forward to reading books 6 thru 8.<br /><br />Buy the set of the first 5 installments. Good price and it is about the length of a standard novel.

B0083P1QUM|4.0|Yet another page turner from Patricia Cornwell. I really enjoyed thus book as well, but still have some unanswered questions regarding the story line... I hope her next book addresses them and is out soon!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A very enticing story. Once you start, it is difficult to put it down. I switched my sympathy back and forth between the main character so many times I lost count.
B004ZN9NCY|5.0|Most of my generation of Americans \\"discovered\\" Pink Floyd with the advent of Dark Side Of The Moon and regressed into their previous history backwards.  Most but not all.  The Pink Floyd had a hearty following in the UK with top 10 albums long before DSOTM, this being one of them.  In high school, I had an English teacher who was somewhat of a, no strike that, he WAS, a hippy to say the least.  He was young, a Vietnam Veteran, returned from the war with a teaching certificate, a very unusual man.  He and his wife used to have some of us juniors and seniors over for tea or coffee and long rounds of mahjong (he was of Japanese descent, from Hawaii) which he taught us.  Out would come the music invariably and through him we discovered a penchant for long trip-factor tracks, entire sides of the best experimental  music, It's A Beautiful Day, In The Court Of The Crimson King, even Fairport Convention and Miles Davis (In A Silent Way), so it was he who was responsible for exposing my friends and I to our first Pink Floyd album, being the (then) brand new Ummagumma!  I was already a \\"space cadet\\" and promptly marched right out to buy my own copy of this random space noise.  At the time several critical reviews led by Rolling Stone magazine had given the album a drubbing and as the follow-up to the prior year's Saucerful Of Secrets, Pink Floyd was officially ordained \\"random space noise\\" and like all good rebellious teenagers we just loved it all the more.  A thing unexplored by others is a private joy for a cult.<br /><br />About the sound of the 2011 remaster, for those of you only interested in replacing a previous copy.  Ummagumma, released as a double album in '69 was for its time, one of the best engineered albums released.  Pink Floyd were always ahead of the technology curve in that respect and many UK reviewers noted the exceptional recording of the live set (LP1).  The audience(s) of Mother's Club and Manchester College were unusually nonintrusive and the fidelity was top notch.  One might conclude (probably) that the Pink Floyd's fans and audience were gassed and flaccid from Cannabis Libations.  Brian Humphries' original engineering has to be applauded even so.  The studio set (LP2) was even more astonishing, and on headphones it revealed a clarity and crisp sound found in only the best recordings from that period.  Now, in 1994, Ummagumma was digitally remastered for release on CD.  I did not purchase this CD and so cannot compare CD to CD but can compare original LP to 2011 CD.  The \\"Why Pink Floyd...?\\" re-release campaign of 2011 has produced the best mastering of The Floyd and in my ears, suffers from not a single flaw and should be considered one of the best efforts in the digital era to meticulously re-master original recordings while painstakingly preserving the integrity of the original recordings.  You will find no issues with audio peaks, loudness, nothing, just beautiful rendering!  Make note that the live disc, CD1, of Ummagumma was not remastered as it was felt that the 1994 mastering had stood up to the test of time.  There is only so far you can go with some articles and this live performance set was already at the top of its game in 1969.  You will discern a bit of tape hiss on the live CD but it was unavoidable.  The original masters contained it, I heard it on my original LP and without sacrificing musical integrity it could not be accomplished.  I still feel the recording is one of the best live sets of Pink Floyd you can find, second only to the P*U*L*S*E CD set which is one of the best live recordings in the history of music.  The studio set 2011 mastering is impeccable!  The sound of CD2 \\"feels\\" organic and actually better than the analog LP.<br /><br />I call this review a Pink Floyd Picture Book because that is essentially what you are purchasing with Ummagumma.  Pink Floyd were a legendary stage performance, and were just as legendary in the studio with magical effects.  The live performances on Ummagumma amount to four of their most favored (by fans and followers) long sets.  Never satisfied to leave well enough alone, Pink Floyd toyed with things.  In their first incarnation with Syd Barrett at the helm they produced (aptly named on a future album cover) a collection of bizarre curios and antiques from ye olde curiosity shoppe.  They melded spacey and classical art forms with art nouveau and rock into highly complex and experimental compositions.  Their faith was for their fan base and not for the masses, for radio, nor especially for music critics.  With the loss of Syd to other worldly explorations, Pink Floyd revisited these four curios from two previous years in the studio.  Astronomy Domine (pronounced Dom-ee-nay like the Catholic Latin incantation) was amped up from the original Syd Barrett curiosity into a harder Gilmour-guitar standard.  A gorgeous keyboard interlude is added to the middle section for some tranquility and a dash of rocket effects, and you have a primer for how to create a mythos in music!  Next, take a REAL bizarre song, cute but bizarre, Careful With That Axe Eugene, and slow drub it, add much creep factor, eerie keyboard overlays like the moors at midnight, and instead of a synthesized guitar-voice, use a menacing whisper and a blood-curdling scream to turn that cute little bizarre tune into a full-on Horror Movie of a music track.  Now THAT was brilliance and I am sure some of the audience members wet themselves on first listen to that!  Okay, so that revisited 1967, and on side two of said original LP, the previous '68 studio effort, A Saucerful Of Secrets, was now up to reinterpretation.  Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun, a rather oriental experiment on SOS was the favorite of many fans.  It has a loping drum and bass line, a psychedelic keyboard modulation, haunting lyrics, extremely subtle guitar work from both Gilmore and Barrett (the only track ever with all five band members) and is just plain gripping.  A year later, gone live, the song is significantly extended with a much wider range of dynamics, and extended (and beautiful organ accent, angst drumming, spatial guitar explorations, a cessation of drumming and astrophysical travel, a hint of explorations to come in Echoes, and voila!)  Set The Controls actually travels the length and breadth of the solar system.  In similar fashion, A Saucerful Of Secrets, title track from the same '68 album, is duly extemporized, extended, and tweaked (to a better end in my opinion).  The result of all this is a fantastic live set on one CD that any fan of Pink Floyd music would be appreciative of.  For novice Floydians, the music on this album will genuinely be organic with the sounds to be perfected on Meddle, especially on Echoes.<br /><br />The studio set, LP2 or CD2, was another thing altogether.  Here is where The Pink Floyd Picture Book takes individual snapshots.  And you will either love it or hate it.  Yes there are some who are \\"indifferent\\" to the second part of Ummagumma, but I will bet they have a liking of at least some parts.  Non-Floydians might as well pass on this one.  There are reviews aplenty on this set, if you want detailed analysis, but a note for novice Floyd fans.  If you indeed love Pink Floyd, don't be put off by lower review standards.  Some say that there are few tracks on this album to which you will return regularly, that much of it is so experimental that you might listen once and forget it for a few years.  The plain fact is that unless you are one of those (and only IF) who likes DSOTM and Wish You Were Here only, in other words a \\"casual fan\\", and are otherwise indifferent to Pink Floyd, if in fact you are a true Floydian, then I disagree wholeheartedly.  There are tracks by Barrett, incessant and dissonant noodlings, and cacophonies by Waters (Corporal Clegg for example, which worked for me in '68 as a Lennon-styled psychedelic indulgence but has not stood the test of time) which more offend my earsthan the experiments conducted on Ummagumma.  Because of that, and because of the outstanding engineering and mastering done here, I give Ummagumma 5 stars both for the remastering and for the original material in comparison to other masters and other recordings in the same vein.  For Floydians, this album is a treasure, for critical Floydians it is a 4-star effort compared to their masterpieces, for Non-Floydians it is a two star or at best 3 star experiment.  Richard Wright provides a four part keyboard movement suite called Sysyphus, based upon the Greek myth of same-named anti-hero who was punished for his chronic criminal behavior by being forever made to repeatedly push a large boulder up a hill and never attain the top crest.  The suite movement follows a theme which mutates into free-form piano, then into a journey into hades, a breaking dawn on the beautiful shores of the river Styx, punishment, and then then again the theme motif (fashioned after a repeating mellotron motif).  Roger Waters' contribution is a lovely acoustic guitar and poetic vocal track Grantchester Meadows, complete with swimming and splashing effects, birds and minstrels.  Waters double-tracks his vocals nicely to affect a duet and the birds supply an actual \\"other\\" instrument.  G Meadows, by way of a fly-swatter, segues directly into Several Species Of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together In A Cave And Grooving With A Pict.  Often a Halloween favorite to blare on trick-or-treaters, the gist of the track is that one can create animal sounds in the studio using voice and tape effects, hands clapping and leg-slapping, and the end result is quite a feat of engineering.  Actually humorous and enjoyable, some folk might relegate this one to just so much \\"noise\\".  If you still have your old record and an older player, use your hand to slow down the turntable to approximately half the 33-1/3 RPM speed at about four and a half minutes in, and you will hear Roger saying \\"That was pretty avant-garde, wasn't it?\\"  At the end, the Pict is actually speaking old English with a heavily Gaelic accent, but if you pay attention, you will be able to figure out what he is saying without a translator (it is all in the pronunciation, and bear in mind that a \\"Claymore\\" is a sword).  David Gilmore provides the best effort on LP2/CD2.  Although he maintains it was something a little more than rubbish, many fans simply love The Narrow Way.  All sounds made with guitars, it is both a cosmic voyage a la 2001, and an intrepid trilogy of movements from acoustic space to dark matter and on to lyrical poetry of an Odysseus nature.  Mr. Nick Mason finishes off the picture book with a three part suite of his own.  The Grand Vizier's Garden Party is circus of drumming that provides some excellent entertainment and visual imagery for the imaginative (that is).  It opens and closes with Mrs. Mason's flute, the only non-Pink Floyd instrument provided on the whole album.<br /><br />So what you have here, is a picture book of Pink Floyd, the group which will provide masterpiece soundtracks to our lives, and the individual members as parts of the whole.  Highly enjoyable to Pink Floyd cult members, not so for others, but don't knock it until you have tried it.  Huge kudos to James Guthrie and Doug Sax for the RE-mastering of this classic and all the 2011 re-issues, that alone is worth 4 stars.  Floyd albums have always been on the pricey side (ever see one in a cutout bin??? Well, have you?) so don't expect the price of the doubles (Ummagumma, The Wall) in the Discovery series to fall anytime soon (and then they will become 3rd party merchant expensive pieces).  Unfortunately, the price of being a Pink Floyd fan has always put a dent in the wallet, especially in the 70's when the UK imports were of such higher sound fidelity and the original covers so much more attractive without text, alterations, or stickers.ater, gone live, the song is significantly extended with a much wider range of dynamics, and extended (and beautiful organ accent, angst drumming, spatial guitar explorations, a cessation of drumming and astrophysical travel, a hint of explorations to come in Echoes, and voila!)  Set The Controls actually travels the length and breadth of the solar system.  In similar fashion, A Saucerful Of Secrets, title track from the same '68 album, is duly extemporized, extended, and tweaked (to a better end in my opinion).

B007ZXK08C|3.0|This was an interesting book that delves deep into the psyche of the two main characters. I did struggle to like either one to be honest but it did keep my interest and it was an easy read.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Does what it is supposed to do. Easy to use and understand. Results give a good picture of your phone's battery status.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Such an interesting topic. Should a person be given the right to end their life if they feel life isnt worth living??? Its the age old debate and this puts a very interesting spin on it with a love story thrown in.  Great read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show and have watched it from the beginning and can't wait for the next season! I think this is one of the best show on TV!
B001K3EXTA|5.0|Eagerly awaiting the new film, watching this one is like a walk in the past.  Great film, great actors from a great time in film history as well
0307279189|5.0|Christopher McDougall says the four basics of optimal health are clean air, good food, fresh water and low stress.  Trail running, a fast-growing outdoor sport invites all ages to participate.  I am not a runner, but I am a reader, and thrilling true adventure stories captivate me.  So - I just spent seven hours not sleeping - just reading \\"Born To Run\\", a book recommended by my son-in-law, himself a superathlete, who knew I'd enjoy it; why? because learning something new is so rewarding and so much brain fun!<br /><br />You've read the reviews - you know this book describes ultra runners who run 100 miles and more just for the sheer joy of it.  In fact, they say if running feels like work you are working too hard!  I was fascinated by the invisible people in the Copper Canyons of Mexico - the Tarahumara Indians who can easily run hundreds of miles. I learned about their food and customs.<br /><br />After finishing the book I felt I knew each quirky character; how and why they wanted to run long distances in such a remote and dangerous area is beyond my comprehension.  This book is exceptionally well-written and there are many insights into the art of running without injury.  There is humor and also sadness in the journey thru the canyons.  If you are not familiar with the long distance races held in this country, especially the one in Leadville, Colorado and how it came about, you are in for surprises.<br /><br />Thanks to the author and to you who are reading this review - enjoy the book and talk about it - you don't have to be a runner however you may want to try it!  All this action has taken place within the last few years and continues on!  It is a true and ongoing story.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|the only thing that am disapointed is the cover was soft sheap plastic but oh well that is not a big deal what I care more about are the  cds and its amazing awsome thank you for been in great shape and specially on time
B008B9JTLI|4.0|Sam Jacksons best role in a while. He is not nick fury in this one. &#34;not just another snapshot&#34; . Jackson fans you remember that.
B00C4QWDYY|5.0|I have literally watched almost all T.V. sci-fi adventure series. This world created is so realistic, the actors are incredible, provoking muliple emotions tha literally take one into a deep place. The undead are barely what pulls this show into my heart. The coping with moment to moment human emotion in a horrific new world where personal choice is to be good, bad, indecive, follower, leadership, loyalty, betrayal, compassionate, shows us all being trully human and authentic. The tremedous charachters with thier assetts and liabilities engulf one and feel connected to them. The grief, loss, trauma, brutality makes me care for the characters deeply like no series before. Brilliant writting, fantastic acting, believable settings and filming angles make the show flow with little down time, each scene has meaning. If one is just hoping for more zombies who are faster, there are other shows for that. What zombie scenes there are , they are superb, completely convincing with fright and also pity for they once where people. The show tugs on so many emotions, reactions, I doubt that no one cannot relate to the show in thier own way. Myself devestated with Andrea,s death by trying to do no harm for both clans, speaks of her goodness, bravery and a role model for us all. I hope this series goes on many a season. Good series, like a beloved pet, eventually end when we are not ready. Season 4 has so many great avenues to create a multitude of the groups destiny, lets hope the writters, producers, actors do not get into conflict, like many a good series have had, ending the adventure with no decent closure for us, and especially all the charachters we have grown to admire and love. Please excuse any miss spellings or grammer, I have post acute Lyme and current re infection that is causing me cognitive problems.<br />Love and light, stop chemtrails, GMO,s, Lyme, Haarp, NWO, and let us re build America as an honest, loving place.

B0087DFIYA|4.0|A good action movie- Gibson narrates throughout the movie which reminded me of payback. Definately worth checking out for Gibson fans.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love this game - it's kind of addicting for me. However, every time I open it up, I'm bombarded by 3 to 5 ads, which is quite annoying.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|I really liked this movie- great cast-great action- wish Robert Patrick had been in it longer. This was a good movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|With a background in healthcare, I can relate to this author. I find his discussion of what happened to him very insightful.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I enjoyed the overall story, but every time he introduced another character, I thought &#34;here we go again&#34;. too much of that in this book
B004V8W54Q|4.0|This isn't the original version it's been touched up a bit, but only a few relatively unimportant scenes were cut. But I recommend seeing the original cut first. But this does the film justice. It's incredible, just buy it!
B0018AT7DW|5.0|One of the best albums ive ever heard (: Love the Grateful Dead, American Beauty is a truly great album.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|This is a classic. I can watch this over and over and laugh the entire time. Just get it so you don't have to wait.

B009YQJ322|2.0|We have seen the Stallone Judge Dredd movie many, many times.  We bought this one hoping it too would be good.  But the actor playing Judge Dredd in this version just did such a lackluster performance that it was quite a disappointment for us.  We were disappointed in the whole movie and doubt we'll ever watch it again.
1419705849|5.0|I got this for a kid I tutor, he has all of the books and reads them often. They are even fun for adults...
B005LAIIPS|2.0|We have the 3 original Bourne movies.  All 3 were good.  Sadly with this one, it's yet another case of someone trying to reopen and played out gold mine.  They should have just given the movie some other name.  As an action type movie, it wasn't bad, but tacking the Bourne name to it to try to make more money on it was sad.  We were very disappointed in it and if there were ever another &#34;Bourne&#34; movie made, we probably wouldn't even bother to see it because this one killed the &#34;Bourne&#34; name for good.
B00008EPM5|5.0|2 April 2013<br /><br />This &#34;album&#34; was great waaaayyy back then, in my teenage years, when it came out.  It hasn't lost any of its greatness as I listen to it now!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a simple calculator for simple arithmetic; Income Tax, Checkbook, price comparisons, that sort of thing. This little gadget does the job very well, with a display I can read across the desk; without my glasses; and buttons that my old arthritic fingers don't miss. Usually, I find gratuitous advertising irritating, but the ads are unobtrusive, although attention-getting, have not yet interrupted my use of the calculator, and I'm well aware that everything has a price. These ads seem fair to me.<br /><br />For basic arithmetic, this is JUST WHAT I NEED
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another spellbinding sequel to the first book...I'm reading faster and faster!! Only one more to read...how will it all end. It is so sad what intelligent beings can do to each other. We see it everyday!!!
B005M61PGA|5.0|Love it. So different from the previous disks, and still this remains the inimitable Katie's style. This is a must for the Katie Melua fans.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I watched this movie 3x in a row in the same sitting. Lincoln is a hero of mine and this movie was an illustration of why

B00915G6SU|1.0|I have never missed a season or not purchased a season until now, I miss Emily and nobody can replace her. She was such a strong part of the show, I wish them luck but as far as I'm concerned Criminal Minds is off the air!!!
B000I2J2XQ|4.0|It didn't hold up to blu-ray. These are cheap now but why bother with something so short lived as HD?
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My 9 year old read it and he said it is a good book.  Even he got his dad wanting to read it too.
0790729342|5.0|I think this one delivered the most bleak and entertaining view of the three movies. Each has its own merit.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|this was a gripping story of young lovers and their parents.  It held my interest to the very end.  I loved it
B00005QCVY|5.0|I can't imagine a Christmas without seeing this movie. It reminds someone of what Christmas is suppose to be. Great
B003L77TZI|5.0|I love Katy Perry, and this CD has some of her really big hit songs. It's worth the purchase price!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The whole series was great.  Considering the target audience was teenagers, I was none too sure how I would like it. Great story and great characters!
B002ZG994U|3.0|For the record, I have never actually watched the original \\"A-Team\\" TV show from the 1980s. I recognize the theme song and know that Mr. T was in it, but that's as far as my knowledge goes.<br /><br />So I came into the movie adaptation of \\"The A-Team\\" with no preconceptions -- and ended up with a hilariously ridiculous, over-the-top action movie that glories in just how wild and absurd it can be. However, the second half gets bogged down in \\"serious\\" downer drama, and a rather incoherent subplot about a treacherous CIA agent.<br /><br />As the story opens, Colonel Hannibal Smith (Liam Neeson) and his friend \\"Faceman\\" Peck (Bradley Cooper) are on a covert mission to take down the thuggish General Tuco. However, things go dramatically wrong when Peck gets too cuddly with Tuco's wife, and Smith ends up enlisting mohawked BA Baracus (Quinton Jackson) and insane daredevil-pilot Murdock (Sharlto Copley) to help him take down Tuco.<br /><br />Okay, team assembled. On to the REAL plot.<br /><br />Eight years later, the team is in Iraq as American forces prepare to pull out. But the team is sent on a covert mission by General Morrison (Gerald McRaney) -- retrieve US treasury plates from Saddam loyalists. The mission goes perfectly... until the team gets back, when Morrison is killed and the treacherous Brock Pike (Brian Bloom) steals the plates. With no proof of the mission's legitimacy, the A-Team is dishonorably discharged, separated and sentenced to years in prison.<br /><br />Six months later, a CIA agent called Lynch (Patrick Wilson) offers Hannibal reinstatement and clean records if they track down Pike and the plates, and helps Hannibal escape (courtesy of a drugged cigar). Hannibal manages to break the rest of his team out of their various prisons, pursued by Face's ex-girlfriend Charissa Sosa (Jessica Biel). But it doesn't take long for the team to realize that they're being betrayed all over again...<br /><br />Let's be frank: \\"The A-Team\\" is not a good movie. From an objective cinematic standpoint, it's actually pretty awful. But it falls into that rare category of \\"bad movie\\" that is enjoyable when you turn off your brain and just laugh at the overblown action scenes, ridiculous antics) and scenarios that are so absurd that you just can't help but enjoy them (the entire flying-tank scene, which is pure insane cheez).<br /><br />And therein lies the movie's charm, because it knows that it's stupid and ridiculous. And it enjoys every single chance to be stupid and ridiculous -- Hannibal escaping a cremation oven, or the team blasting through the wall of a mental hospital. It's more a comedy than an action movie (\\"Excuse me, which way to Berlin?\\").<br /><br />However, the movie tends to start fraying when it tries to be serious. The second half derails itself when the team starts getting all angsty and tortured over the betrayals they've suffered, and the whole subplot about the Treasury macguffins just feels pointless. And the more like a serious action thriller it tries to get, the more incoherent and confusing it becomes.<br /><br />The cast is pretty good here -- Liam Neeson plays Hannibal with cigar-chomping gusto, though able to be serious and intense when necessary. Quinton Jackson gives a thoroughly endearing performance as the bombastic BA, although his vow of not-killing feels strangely shoehorned in; Bradley Cooper is quite charming when he isn't floundering in a poorly-written romance with the prissy Jessica Biel. And no, the romance leads to nothing.<br /><br />But the real scene stealer is Sharlto Copley. This guy is gutsplittingly funny, and all too plausible as a possibly insane weirdo who takes every chance to be... a possibly insane weirdo (\\"You should see these bullets in 3D! It's like we're actually getting shot at!\\").<br /><br />\\"The A-Team\\" is a confusing, bombastic mess of a movie -- and when it doesn't take itself too seriously, it's also a lot of guilty-pleasure fun. Expect explosions, ridiculous stunts and a flying tank.ts and a flying tank.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this series. Biting my nails all night Sunday waiting for each episode to hit my Amazon account on Monday. Can't wait until season 4.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I watched all 3 seasons on PBS and loved it enough to buy it.  This is the British version and I was disappointed to find that whole scenes were edited out, presumably to allow for the commercials on ITV in England.  These scenes were not crucial, but did clarify some later events.  If I buy the 4th season, I will be sure to get the US version.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I'm glad I found this game. Big Fish rocks. Just wish that games I purchased for my PC could transfer.<br /><br />Added: Just a note to the developers, let's just say that the lobster in the game can look a little \\"questionable\\" if one has a fertile (read dirty) imagination.
B000002JSP|5.0|Bought this cd for my husband and he loved it. Ask for it for christmas and Santa came through ha ha
B0089EHWQE|5.0|We all know people who have been injured and we do not know how they feel inside - incapacitated, unable to move or sometimes speak. So here is this mover and shaker 30-plus somebody who is completely dependent on others to survive. And just survive - not live or excel at anything. How tragic this situation must be.<br />Into his life comes a girl who has no experience with medical issues or this type of injury.  She turns his life upside down and he does the same to her. All through the book, they learn from each other and each of them must decide what is important to them.<br />Fascinating, gripping, heart-rending; truly a beautiful love story and a thought-provoking look at family dynamics. I would recommend this book to all people interested in good literature.
B0000067L2|5.0|great cd or album. alway loved anything Eric Claptin sings or writes. would recommend this cd 5 stars or more
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|It will not let me connect to multiplayer even when im by my router fix please amazon<br /> because im abojt to switch to google because you guys cant even fix your apps,and update them!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire was always a good game to  pass the time. Rated 4 to 5 stars. try it you will like it
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book is so hard to put down! You will get caught up Hannah's story immediately if you read it. It is told from the point of view of Clay, a boy who had a crush on Hannah Baker, a girl who had killed herself only a short tie before. It alternates back and forth between listening to the tapes Hannah has left explaining why she killed herself, and Clay's reaction as he learns more about why Hannah did this to herself. It is a haunting book that will make you think.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Different than the show on AMC which I'm addicted to, but just as awesome! So stoked to read the next  one.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|The case does not fit the kindle at all (fire hd ) which I was not aware of. So basically the purchase was pointless.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Made me laugh and tear up! Amazing characters, and a very touching story.  A must read  for any age. Definitely 5 star worthy.
0452287022|5.0|This was a selection by my Book Club.  I did not know her work before, but was so impressed with GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING that I immediately read another of her books, THE LADY AND THE UNICORN.  I am in no way a visual artist, but her books make me see visual art in a new way; I can smell it, feel it, taste it.  As a writer she is subtle .  (From the Latin, meaning &#34;fine woven.&#34;
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this variety of games it encourages goobld decision making and helps with the ability to save points/money.
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|David Baldacci is a fantastic author who always keeps you guessing.  Where is the story going, what on earth is going to happen next.  He also develops a terrific sense of identity for the characters.
B0087EACJK|3.0|Nice take on a classic called Lode Runner. One major flaw. No where does it mention screen orientation matters, but it does. If you flip your device 90 degrees, suddenly your character is running on what used to be walls. This probably will come into play later but because it did not cooperate with the gyro in my tablet, I had to fight the first level. It decided I had turned my tablet when I didn't. I could turn it and orient my character on the proper surface, but I then had to play 90 degrees turned instead of left to right I was up to down with my character thinking the left wall was down. I dislike any game requiring the use of auto gyro corrections. Not all devices have the same properties so most games don't function properly. In my settings I can switch it to correct this, but I have three games and each only works when this is set to a different setting for each individual game. I would just prefer to not have it activated at all.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Lee Child weaves a fantastic story line.  Jack Reacher is a brutally simple character who you just cant help like, even tho he is technically a serial killer.
B00BF123WG|5.0|This is a good movie. Starts out slow. But, it covers events very well. Which is needed to understand it all.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Thanks for another great story!  Kept me turning the pages from chapter one. Very likeable characters and nice twists and turns in the plot.

B0055S348W|4.0|I had a specific need to print web pages from my Kindle and this works great printing directly to my HP P1102w wireless LaserJet.  It also prints pictures.  It would be nice if it printed my Gmail but that feature doesn't work yet becasue of how the Kindle manages accounts.  It's pricey but allow my $300 Kindle to do one of key purposes I use it for.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|What an underrated movie! I pretty much put off seeing it cause I never watched the Tintin cartoons and I thought the title sounded kinda lame. Boy am I glad I finally  sat down and watched it! This was such a fun movie! And I have never seen animation this good! When the movie started I actually thought for a moment that it was live action. The animation was that great! Then, throughout the movie, I found myself going &#34;That can't be animation!&#34; To me, the all around feel of this movie was Pixar meets Classic Indiana Jones. I highly recommend this movie!! An awesome Blu-Ray buy! Thank you Steven Spielberg!
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for children and adults.  What a wonderful lesson for all of humanity.  We all must speak for the trees.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|My kids absolutely loved this movie! It was great to see someone bringing black and white back. I even enjoyed this film as an adult.
0062238868|5.0|Very interesting, very informative and interesting,a lot of history was made with the seals, and other of the military. Really makes a person appreciate what the military is doing for us
B002YCVX5S|5.0|I love this movie just as much as I loved Inglorius Basterds. Some people say the Hitler scene is a bit over the top. I say so what. Its a great film.

B002W7J3SO|3.0|For being a movie &#34;classic&#34; I was expecting the movie to hold up reasonably well. It does not. It appears dated and not very believable. Although there are some classic scenes that must be seen.

B009X01GJ2|4.0|I really enjoyed this product. The only problem I had with it was that it was challenging to turn it. Otherwise no complaints
B004NOCCEG|5.0|If you never see or read anything about the raping and corrupting of America, see this. You will be unsettled. And you should be. You, the citizen, whether right or left, NEED to wake up now!
B00993FEUK|5.0|I had seen the theater ad's and bought unseen. I did enjoy it. Fun to watch. I would suggest that a person view this movie before showing it to young children. It might frighten some of the younger ones. The movie itself was a blast to see and Blu-ray version is fantastic. Loved It.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|This is a great look into the relationships of Mr. Hitchcock, namely his wife, Alma. If you're looking an extensive exposé on just how creepy Hitchcock could be, you'll be disappointed. There certainly is some of that but the true treasure in this film is the look inside his relationships and his passions. This film is supremely interesting and moving. Watch it. Go. Now. Watch.
B004K00NEO|5.0|I purchased this on regular dvd first and loved it.....However when I bought and viewed it Blu-ray it was unbelievable. The detail jump's out, the clarity and color's are much more brilliant. Small things are very noticeable and defined.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I only recently got a PS3, but having played on many consoles, I knew going in I hated the Dualshock.  A lot of friends swear by the thing, but the Dualshock is simply too small and cramped for my hands.<br /><br />The Pro Elite, on the other hand, with it's size and shape, as well as the switched d-pad and left analog stick make it very comfortable to me and my big hands.  Without it, gaming on my PS3 would be frustrating.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the dead zones on the analog sticks, and I can confirm that it is quite significant. I play all my shooters on PC with a gaming mouse, so this isn't a problem for me.  The main reason I have a PS3 is for the titles that simply aren't available on other systems, like Uncharted and Shadow of the Colossus, and for these games, this controller is exceptional.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I thought I would like this app, since I have yahoo email but once I downloaded it and used it I could not figure out how to log off the email...my account simply stayed open all the time.  I tried going to the internet and logging out that way, but it seems that the app and the internet website are not in sync...i got nervous having my email open all the time because in the past ive been hacked that way....so i ended up deleting the app completely and I will just use the website address and log in that way.  Its quite possible that I just dont know what I am doing though....
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a good book to read. I would recommend it to a good friend. I will keep on reading.
031603441X|5.0|At 67, most individuals would be rocking into the sunset of their lives, but rocker Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones is still doing what he loves, making good `ole rock and roll.<br />In his autobiography Life, Richards shares his life's journey, the ups, the downs, and the roller coaster of a ride inside the world of a true rock star.  He vividly shares his use of drugs, of women, and other vices but the core of the story lies on a man who simply wants to be loved, create good music, and enjoy life.<br />The book chronicles his many run in with the law and how no matter how much of a legal mess he go in, he was with the help of others get back on the right course.<br />The book has some interesting side notes of the candid retelling of Richards' stories but the individual's account, seeming to take the reader to the first hand eye witness account.<br />When reading Richard's life story, one would expect more scandalous tales, but they seem pretty normal being the bad boy rock star.  Most of the candid revelations occur in the second part, he did snort his father ashes, his fall from a tree that cracked his skull, and his tender last moments with his mother.<br />Much of the publicity book has centered if his bad boy image is too much for his up coming role as Captain Jack Sparrow's father in the soon to be released Pirates of the Caribbean movie but Johnny Deep notes that his portrayal of the pirate was partly based on Keith Richards.  So it seems to be a right fit to have Richards make a cameo in the movie.<br />At 564 pages, Life is fascinating first account of the inner world of a true rock star.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This was a good movie good-quality will keep watching and who recommended to my friends My granddaughter loves this movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it! One of the best reads I've had in awhile! Great story of love and courage and great strength!

1451695195|4.0|Dr. Eben Alexander lay in a coma for over a week before awakening with a remarkable story of what had transpired while he was unconscious. The former agnostic told a remarkable tale of his missing time. While large parts of his brain were not functioning, the doctor had experienced a remarkable journey into another world - a world of the afterlife, through which he was guided by an amazing being who defys description. Whatever your religious beliefs (or lack of same), you will be intrigued by his tale of a man of science confronting the unknown.<br /><br />A terrific story for both believers and seekers from a man of science.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hey it was a good book everybody told me but I couldn't get into it because it does prologue was too long
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|The controls (and I tried both methods) are a little wonky as are the mission objectives.  Graphics are blocky, but not atypical for a 3D game on the first gen Kindle Fire.  It was a good free-app-of-the-day.  If I'd have paid for it, I'm not sure I would have rated it 3 stars.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Pretty good. Although if you find Redstone it's worthless you can mine it , but you won't get anything out of it. You can't see the sun, and its impossible to get to the nether because there is no obsidion. Other than that it's pretty cool.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|I'll just get this out of the way now:  I really, really hate that you have to sign into this app with Gmail (or Facebook or whatever).  It should have the option of being a stand-alone product.  There's really no reason it couldn't be log-in free if you're only using it locally and not from the outside of your firewall.<br /><br />That said, it's easy to use, responsive and generally hassle free (once you get past the log-in requirement).  The required PC client (requisite to be loaded on each PC you want to control) has a pretty small footprint and does a better than average job of serving up your screen on your Android device; average being RDP.  And it doesn't require you to log in to lock the remote screen like RDP does on a workgroup-based Windows client.<br /><br />Splashtop claims you can watch a stream of video from PC to tablet, but I haven't found it to be *that* fast.  Video is juddery - especially at native PC resolutions - though the audio is clear.  I'm probably doing it wrong by selecting the native display resolution of the PC and not letting the client control the video size, but my desktop icons get all messed around if I let the client control resolution.  So, no, I'll just stick with native resolution, thanks.<br /><br />The only real reason I didn't rate it 5-stars is the change in v2 that puts the options menu in the lower right-hand corner.  This change makes it difficult to access the clock area on a Windows computer - a real drag if what you're looking for is in the hidden icons section.  It'd be nice to have an option to move the options menu to another corner to get around this issue.<br /><br />EDIT:  They seem to have fixed the menu-getting-in-the-way issue I mentioned above somewhere along the line.  You can now move the dock around wherever you want it.  I'm still keeping the review at 4 stars because the newer versions have become a little more laden with \\"opportunities\\" to purchase a subscription and/or version upgrade.  They gottaget paid, but the interface has become a little bit more reminiscent of a minefield when you're trying to avoid nag screens.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|It was very detailed and showed two different cultures merging.however I thought the book was not finished in terms of characters. Like there can be a part 2
B00A8ECU24|1.0|What can I say about MLP that hasn't already been said?  I downloaded it for my daughter and she loves it.  I freaking hate it, though my hatred is based on the monetary system of the game that would happily rise up to the level of simply &#34;predatory&#34;.<br /><br />My HUGE problem with it is that the in-game currency (all 8 types or so when you include gems, et. al.) is harder to come by than it should be, progress is far too slow because of the lack of funds, and EVERYTHING you're asked to do for missions nudges the player toward the need (not desire, the need) to buy in-game currency.  But buying currency is WAY, WAY too expensive in real dollars.<br /><br />Just to use an example:  to get Princess Celestia - one of the &#34;must haves&#34; of the MLP world - would cost almost $200 worth of in-game currency.  $200 REAL dollars for a handful of ones and zeros.  I call BS on that.  And that's just one pony.  Rainbow Dash - another must have - is about half Celestia's cost, but still...$100 in American dollars?  Really?  And that's hardly it.  There are somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 ponies all with varying costs.  And to progress in the game you have to buy them - at least the major pony players.  Not to mention the exponentially growing cost of opening up new parcels of land and clearing debris just so you can have a place to put in-world objects.<br /><br />And your target market is a five-year-old little girl?  Seriously?  There's a special place in hell for Gameloft over this game.
B004ETVAH0|3.0|Not exact;u what I expected. After the first listen, it will take a while to come back to it and listen again.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This isn't your average strategy game, this is a highly addictive, dare I say, guilty pleasure.  The problem is you don't feel the least bit guilty while destroying humanity.  I found myself getting upset when people weren't dying fast enough.  If you like strategy games, and you are interested at all in science, this game will consume you.  I remember a smaller version a few years ago and this version is a vast improvement.  This game is worth every cent and more.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|Jeff Beck is an astounding guitar player, and Rod Stewart was at his best in this effort. Brings back the memories of the day.
0545265355|4.0|I don't tend to like story's told by girls side of it, but unfortunately there isn't many good trilogies written with man as main character.  I was skeptical at first because the movie was very much a girls movie but after reading the reviews said what the hey only a few bucks right?  Well books were good story good only the first half of the second but was chick flikish and it was a great read regardless
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I gave this game a top rating of five because It's a fun game to play. I like the bright  vivid colors of the game and it's easy to play. So far I haven't found anything that I dislike about it and I would recommend this to my friends and family or to anyone who likes this type of game.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I saw the previews and thought to myself this movie has to be stupid.  Watched it online one night to put me to sleep and was amazed.  Had to buy it!  Amazing movie If you have half a brain you will like it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers rules.so much fun.get this game it will be the best decision you ever made.I play this game all the time.
B000059TEQ|4.0|It was an ok movie.  I had seen it several times when I was much younger and enjoyed it back then...a little bit different as an adult..lol
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I got  the game cause it looked fun but now it is just a waste if time fir me and it just takes up space,plus you have to pay to get more coins and I am NOT spending money in that boring game,and a time waster cause there are do many different things you could be doing instead of playing this stupid , boring game.
B000CNDIZE|5.0|This disc has become one of those in constant rotation amongst my favorite handful. I liked Sia's music the very first time I heard it; this disc exceed my expectations.  She should be on everyone's playlist.
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|I have just begun to play this game. It is a lot of fun and fairly easy to play. The game prompts you with new moves and special items so gameplay is smooth and I really like the game graphics. Try it and you will be glad you did.
B00204AA0O|5.0|Here it is 2013 and I am contemplating buying this album for a family member's birthday.  I have listened to this CD for nearly a year now, dozens of time, and I still put it on to enjoy.  This album sticks to your ears.  It definitely deserved a grammy.

B0076L0S76|1.0|\\"Young Adult\\" confounds all expectations, including its own advertising, and not in a good way. Billed as a comedy and brought to us by the folks who created the winsome \\"Juno,\\"\\"Young Adult\\" turns out to be an unremittingly depressing, frequently ugly film that resolves itself in the end with a baldfaced lie. The premise of the film is recycled and old as time: a wandering \\"star\\" condescends to return to her hometown from the Big City to show the local yokels what it means to be important -- while of course setting herself up for the inevitable lesson that the \\"folks at home\\" are worthier than their Big World counterparts. And yes, \\"wherever you go, there you are.\\" Numerous good films use the Homecoming Revelation to good effect -- funny, moving, even instructive -- but \\"Young Adult\\" is not one of them. No comedy indeed, it is largely a deeply offensive and demoralizing film. Here's why. First, the main character, played by Charlize Theron, manages to be pathetic and narcissistic, and to get herself into all kinds of trouble, while never eliciting a single shred of empathy or care from the viewer. It's a character whom we totally dislike; she's not even good to her dog (says sweet things, but neglects the pooch). Theron does a fantastic job bringing this failed and dislikeable person to convincing life. It is not at all the great comic turn advertised; it's a chillingly convincing rendition of an empty, awful person. It's a performance to admire but the viewer's main experience is one of revulsion. Plot? Well, this awful person causes genuinely cringe-worthy things to happen all around her -- watching it all feels like throwing up, and the film is mostly unbearable as a result. The resolution? She up and leaves for the city, we hear upbeat music and some words contending that she is now going to be a good, together person. This is the big lie in the film. The notion that people change their lives and their very character (and in this case, overcome alcoholism) justby deciding to do so is grossly untrue to the entire history of mankind. This lie diminishes all the true life stories of real people who have made themselves into better people, friends, and lovers not merely by concluding that they should -- we all know we're supposed to be good -- but by doing something about it. There's not one whit of demonstration of change from the main character. The only bright spots in \\"Young Adult\\" are the constellation of minor characters who are laboriously making decent, loving lives. But the movie is not about them -- all are thinly shown and undeveloped. What the film gives us is something else again: a reprehensible, self-centered, unlikeable protagonist whom we are to believe transforms herself through the magic of momentary thought. Apparently, all you need to remake everything about yourself is a good intention! Like most people, I like most movies and don't need or even want every one to be great. Good is fine! But occasionally you run into something really foul -- a film that based on a diminished and false view of human nature -- and \\"Young Adult\\" is one of those rare films. It may have been conceived with good intentions, but the actual film on the screen is, in what it shows and what it means, an awful thing indeed. I honestly feel diminished for having watched it.
B002ZG9968|5.0|Great chick flick!! The disc was in great condition and the price was unbeatable. I have enjoyed watching it over and over!
B000ICM5MG|5.0|More than three decades later, the Oscar-winning &#34;Rocky&#34; (1976) still packs a dramatic punch. Watching Sylvester Stallone's do-or-die project makes you wish there wasn't a rematch. In retrospect, the sequels (though crowd-pleasing hits) were unnecessary. &#34;Rocky&#34; stands on its own uplifting merits — a low-budget triumph that goes the distance. The two-disc &#34;collector's edition&#34; includes a wealth of extras plus a complete Stallone commentary track.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I just can not stop watching this film. Ryan Reynolds and his sarcastic comical humor and Sandra Bullock as a Heartless Editor, aka, Satan's Mistress, is just hilarious and always makes me laugh out loud.

B004DTXJ4S|5.0|Again I was happy with the fast delivery, I think I watch all of them no. There all great I love the actress Alice and I plan on watching this movie many more times. Thanks
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|.....since I have heard numerous songs on one of their CD's that I liked. Disc 1 - Track #3 \\"This Momentary Bliss\\" reminded of something on \\"A Predators Portrait\\" while other songs I may hear something of Figure #5\\"...while many may not like those I hear shades of both of those in some of their songs..not all. So do not rule this out just because I hear that.<br /><br /> For ten bucks you get 20 well mixed and polished songs that crank on \\"10\\" subs. I was very pleased that the bass was not to heavily embedded into it like it was on \\"The Panic Broadcast\\". As for myself this is a step in the right direction to getting the Soilwork of old back.<br /><br /> Only bad thing is that....now it will seem like forever till their next. For any Soilwork fan....you will find something worth while on this.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is so funny! We sure do like this series. If you need a good laugh,  We  laugh so much over this series. Thank's  kids.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is an extremely fun app!! Personally I think it is even better than temple runs 1 and 2!! It is fun for all ages. I totally recommend this app!!
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|When Judge Dredd came out, it proved to be a horrible movie, so I was dumbfound as to why they would do a remake a horrible film that was failure with the viewers and at the bod office.  Thankfully, I listened to a friend and watched Dredd.  This is not a remake of the 1990's storyline.  Dredd is dark with good focus on the characters.  The plot is simple but engaging.  The villain as well as the protagonists are interesting and draws you in.  By no means a masterpiece film, but Dredd is definitely entertaining.
B009OWGMYI|5.0|Anyone who says that rock is dead, has not heard this album. I feel privileged to be alive in the same generation as such amazing music.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is an endearing story that shows us that there is more to live for than our own pleasure and desires. I also like that they don't glorify those horrid violent video games. I love the retro feel of the movie and the innocence of the characters.
B004B63M1S|5.0|This is the best Danny Trejo movie I have ever seen. I also love the additional cast. I haven't seen Steven Seagal since he did the Reality TV show on A&E, The Law Man. He is a great Martial Artist.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Very enjoyable. A little tough to get some of the Scottish accents at first, but it gets easier the longer you watch. A good mix of laughter, adventure, and heartfelt moments.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Although Sarah Silverman is an adult comedienne, she played a great role as a child. I highly recommend this movie for the young and semi-young at heart. This movie brings back great memories of the arcade era.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|Great show!! Love that there aren't any commercial breaks. The only issue is that sometimes the show will freeze because of buffering and you have to refresh your page and resume where you were watching it
B004FRX0MY|2.0|After spending about 10 minutes downloading and installing this app, I discover that I will then need to download anything from the Amazon Cloud that I ever want to play. I thought this would be quick and easy, and instead it was a pain. Perhaps it works great once you download all your music into your phone, but I have an iPod for that purpose with the music already loaded on it.
B00BJA2VFW|3.0|I like the game, but it's repetitive.  I was hoping there would be more than one game repeated over and over in different formats.

B00AMBLDEE|2.0|I loved all of the Jason Bourne movies, but this one was probably the worst.  Very few scenes that were interesting - not necessarily action packed - majority of it was just plain boring.  I would call this one: The Bouring Legacy.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|Very disappointing.  It's slow, the rules are nowhere to be found,so it's hit or miss to figure out what the objective is.  Frankly, not worth the $.99 I paid for it.  Don't bother.

B009AMANH4|5.0|There was a lot of anticipation about the release of Steven Spielberg's \\"Lincoln.\\" The book from which it was based, \\"Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,\\" was re-released, as well as documentaries and magazine articles. Lincoln was the flavor of the month in the media, and all the high expectations were well rewarded. \\"Lincoln\\" delivers and Spielberg has created another one for history. It is an impressive film that makes justice to the legend of what has been referred to as the best the president the United States of America has ever had.<br /><br />About the movie itself, let me just start by saying that what you watch is not the story of Lincoln's life, from the cabin days, his career as a lawyer, his political beginnings, and the like. Instead, what you witness is Lincoln during his final four months in office and his efforts to eradicate slavery and end the bloody Civil War. Hence, the story takes place mostly in the confines of Washington and its politicians. We find our 16th President, Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day Lewis), in a battle against time to pass the constitutional amendment to end slavery and, at the same time, preserve the peace between the north and the south after the war. It is 1965, and it is important to pass this amendment before the war ends, as to prevent the south to boycott it before it becomes law. To accomplish this, he needs the help of William Seward (David Strathairn), his Secretary of State, and Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), a smart and manipulative Republican who is heavily respected in congress. We witness Lincoln in the war room, making decisions and seeking advice on how to win the war and stop the killing, and also trying to buy key congressmen whose votes are needed to pass the amendment - wow, talk about lobbying! In addition, we watch how Lincoln deals with Mary Todd (Sally Field), his troubled, yet strong wife, as well as his sons Robert and Tad. It is nice to watch Lincoln spend some quality time with them, in such tense and dramatic days. There is also some time given to the assassination, but it is done in a different, surprising way. The ending was also well- handed, satisfying, and surprising as well.<br /><br />\\"Lincoln\\" is a true gem, and I have to confess that I will probably have to watch it again, as the political plot and constitutional talk were hard to follow at times, and these are the important elements to understand the so-called genius of Lincoln. It is necessary to note that Spielberg was smart enough to place some African-American actors in some small, but key roles in the film. It is also important to mention that Daniel Day-Lewis deservedly won the Academy Award for his portrayal of Lincoln. The Blu-ray + DVD + Digital copy also includes several documentaries about the making of the film and about Day-Lewis.

After the first time I watch this, I'm not going to want to hear all the jabbering and potty-mouth ramblings.

B004YM6JK0|5.0|I am a Sci-Fi fan of stories that make you think, and Supernatural is right up near the top most episodes, (they get a little a goofy at times). Supernatural makes you think about &#34;Good&#34; & &#34;Evil&#34; and what influences people to be one or the other. Also you have to really pay attention or you may loose the trend of the storyline.  It shows how complex relationships in &#34;FAMILY&#34; can be.  Finally it is just flat entertaining, and you do not get tired of it.  It has to be good to last for 9 seasons.  The fact that it has a multitued of interesting characters and constant twists and turns in the storyline &#34;hooks&#34; you and keeps you wanting more.  GREAT SERIES!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|good kindle adaptation. a must read for everyone. well written story that draws you in from the first chapter. If you've seen the film or broadway production you should definitely read the book

0316077046|5.0|Frankly speaking, I found the first book (Beautiful Creatures, now, a big movie franchise) too much of a drag to read mainly because of how prolonging it was. I wasn't planning on reading or listening to the rest of the series anytime soon. But thanks to my eldest sister's audiobook, I managed to finish it within 3 days. Best thing about this is that I get to listen to it while I worked. I call it 'double productivity' and with that double productivity, I actually grew to love the series!<br /><br />When the book started, I groaned and I did it because the author(s) reuses the same plot from the first book and renames it 17th Moon instead of 16th Moon. Then they begin to write circles and differences around it. But you've got to hand it to them, they did write a damn good book!<br /><br />Ethan (the main character) is a sweetheart and in this installment, the poor guy goes through heaven and hell for Lena (his female counter part). Man, I hate Lena. She's such a victim I can't stand. Even worse are the decisions that she makes, and the fact that she completely doesn't confide in Ethan, like they used to, makes me groan some more! I even rolled my eyes at her a couple of times. I am so happy I don't have to deal with her as the main character. I wouldn't want to get stuck in that head of hers.<br /><br />In the end, my favorite character is Link (Ethan's lame best friend) instead of Ethan. He's one of those dorky characters that will make you cry and laugh at the same time. He can even be considered as the \\"Ron Weasley\\" of the whole series.  He is very much linked to the end of this installment that will literally blow your mind with it's awesomeness!<br /><br />Likewise, we've got the adversaries of Ethan and his gang. The mastermind of the whole evilness reminds me too much of the bad guy in The Hunger Games. But then again, nothing is really new out there.<br /><br />Now, for the beautiful yet gothic land of Gaitlin, South Carolina. So dark, so mystical. I just want to move into this fictional town and spend the rest of my life doing the things I love with the people I love. Of course, I'll only live there if the fictional characters of Gaitlin weren't. If you dislike the characters, you sure won't dislike the town they live in (minus the people). Gaitlin isn't just a home for humans but also Witches or Casters as they like to be called. The world Stohl and Garcia creates for the Casters is so dark and haunting, you can't help but call it beautiful.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, I adored the book. The writing style is flat out written for not only the teens but for mothers, fathers, older brothers, etc. Some characters will surely keep you glued to the book while the storyline remains with the same foundation but still has the ability to keep the reader going, and most importantly, the book encompasses the Beautiful Darkness that continues to draw me even closer to the characters and overall, to the entire series.<br /><br />And with that, I quickly moved to the 3rd book and I'm half way done with the book!nt to move into this fictional town and spend the rest of my life doing the things I love with the people I love.

B00280LYHS|5.0|This is probably the greatest book I have read and I recommend this series to whoever enjoys Greek mythology like me.
B00BOLE7X0|3.0|Costumes, Lincoln quotes, ..... that's about it.  the mob scenes were amateurish, considering .... acting was ok, period reproduction was probably the best part.  for that it deserves credit, but not the hype.  I'm a Lincoln fan and have been since growing up in Illinois so perhaps was a little more eager to see this tiny slice of his life.  eh....<br />Whether the 'dealings' that went on over the 13th amendment were accurately portrayed I can't say, though I suspect they were, I was unaware, so for that, it was worth watching. I finished the movie marveling that a nation could survive based on the unvarnished self interest of a diverse gang of people of less than average intelligence,,, are we surprised?<br />I'm a little sorry I purchased it, as opposed to renting it.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|I did enjoy this DVD as much as I enjoyed the 3D version on the big screen. This is supposedly the &#34;Collector's Edition&#34;, and contains bonus scenes; however, I watched the whole thing without seeing a scene that I didn't (maybe mistakenly) seem to recall from seeing it in theaters. Considering that this Collector's Edition is spread out over two discs, the hassle of having to take out Disc 1 and insert Disc 2 halfway through the film is not really worth the unremarkable bonus material. Unless you're dying to see the bonus scenes, I recommend going with the theatrical version, especially considering that I couldn't tell you what scenes in the Collector's Edition were not in the theatrical release after watching. Go with the theatrical version: it's cheaper and isn't divided up into two parts on two separate discs.
B00AYQNOFI|4.0|Only downside is there in no narrative at all. I would've liked to know which country I was looking at even by a caption. But it was breathtaking.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This was a wonderful movie....what an incredible (true-ish) story! My husband and I watched it on my Kindle on a plane...in retrospect, we should have been a bit more discreet as the movie does contain full frontal nudity....but...such is life! No harm, no foul!  We both enjoyed the story and acting very much. Highly recommend!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I like the game, but I don't know how to update the app, so I'm still in Rio. It stinks, but the game is fun. Sometimes it.crashes tho.

B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This was definitely not the movie I thought it was going to be ....but it was a fantastic movie. I really enjoyed it, though at times it was difficult to watch. Denzel Washington is an incredible actor and after seeing this movie I realized why he looked disappointed not to get the Oscar ....he was amazing. Great movie, great story, great acting by all involved.
0884271536|4.0|good book, interesting to read, but need to focus.<br /><br />It is a novel, but still you are learning about project management.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun to play and instructive hints to teach new moves.  Highly recommended.  Automatic play by touching a card is cleverly done.
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|I wanted to see the movie because I wanted to see Matthew McConaughey in a different role. However, I did not like this movie. We (those of us who watched it) could understand why Matthew McConaughey would take on such a role. Then we through maybe this was before he became as famous as he is now.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I will not recommend this movie to anyone to watch. It would not have been so bad if it was not for the relationship with the 12 year old; that was over the board.

B00APUYWYA|4.0|Really funny! I like Rebel Wilson a lot, and she is the reason I watched this. It literally has you doing the hyena laugh- if you're skeeved out  by puke or puking, theres a pretty nasty scene towards the end..so beware, other than that- it's a lot of OMG humor...
B002WV5A9G|4.0|As far as prequel's go, this is a good one. We didn't really need 'just another star trek movie' and this storyline shakes things up a bit so we can have more star trek and also have something new.

B00028HBKC|5.0|a great movie about the greatest man who ever lived..I recommend this movie for all faiths..Have your tissues handy when you watch it..
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Plenty of twists along the way in this epic series. Can't wait for a Wool 6! Thank you Hugh Howey!
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|So when Greg is at school he likes a girl named holly. But when his mom starts saying do family activities they go to the movies. And his dad sees a man that he knew so he went to military school well he thinks. But it kind of boring
0811879542|5.0|It's quite brilliant.  You shake the book to make the books dots fall and move around.  You tilt it here.  Tilt it there.  It's brilliant.  My daughter and I love it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I like it because it has action like when Grover almost fell into the pit and when aunt em was really mudusa trying to turn them into a statue
1468014269|3.0|I wanted to judge this book for myself rather than accept anyone else's assessment of it.<br /><br />I am glad I did but it wasn't an enjoyable read. It is verbose, turgid and repetitive; its original title was \\"Four and half years of struggle against lies, stupidity and cowardice\\". As a read, I found myself in a fog where paragraphs of opinion followed one another without supporting facts. These opinions were then used to justify ridiculous conclusions. I thought it a truly bad book which came across as the rants of a pub philosopher who holds court with other like minds.<br /><br />When the fog lifts, Hitler's particular world view (repeatedly referred to as Weltanschauung) becomes clear. For example:<br /><br />1. Hitler's hatred for Jews was pathological.. He saw Judaism as a race, more than a religion and Jews as barely human, a nasty form of vermin infecting the blood of the German nation and the source of everything bad. While there is no explicit proposal for mass extermination, I think it shows that the Holocaust is a logical consequence of Hitler's views.<br /><br />2. Hitler was obsessive about the German nation and he regarded the Germanic race to be superior to all others.<br /><br />3. Hitler was obsessed with racial hygiene believing it unnatural for anyone of an inferior race to merge with the Aryan one, believing it weakened his race.<br /><br />4. Hitler was a control freak who envisioned a total, non-democratic state in which all citizens would think and act one way in support of his particular Weltanschauung.<br /><br />5. Hitler's was clearly intending to create a military and militant state and his expansionist plans for invading Eastern Europe were already in mind nearly 20 years before he enacted them. This militancy would be encouraged through the education system in which the ideas would be inculcated and boys would be made to do 2 hours hard physical training every day to make them fit soldiers of the Reich.<br /><br />6. Hitler understoodthe value of propaganda, saying that you cannot win people over through rational argument but widespread, simple repetition of key messages. He was anti-intellectual.<br /><br />7. Hitler is strangely prudish about sex. With no evidence, he believed that young men would be less prone to sexual immorality if they exercised more and studied less.<br /><br />There is much to take issue with and he did not convince me, but I don't think this was the book's intention..<br /><br />He talks about racial selection as being some kind of natural process with animals only breeding with other animals of the same species. On this basis, he regards the union of Aryans and Jews as unnatural. This is a specious parallel as Aryans and Jews (and native Americans, Innuit, Japanese, Black Africans etc etc) are the same species who are capable of mating with each other. You could not say the same about say, dogs and cats.<br /><br />He suggests that mingling of different racial groups results in a weakening of each race. This ignores the fact that every supposedly `pure' race is still the result of plenty of mixing of more localised races in the past. It also ignores the fact that mixing of races does not weaken any race. Scientific research has indicated that mixed race children have stronger immunity systems than non-mixed race children and the success of mixed race sportsmen is there for everyone to see.<br /><br />He slightly confounds his own logic by linking dog breeding with racial purity. When you think about it, there is nothing natural about pure bred dogs. They are simply the results of man selecting partners for his dogs to develop animals which will happily serve him. Maybe Hitler secretly regarded his mission as the breeding of the German nation to become a huge pack of German Shepherd dogs who would be his loyal pets.<br /><br />I also take issue with the issue about propaganda. Hitler wrote that the Jewish owned press in Germany was undermining the German war effort inWorld War 1 while the British press was content to tell any lie about Germany in order to bolster the war effort - something he rather admired. I don't have enough information about British propaganda nor the ownership of the German press (although I don't imagine that it was as dominated by jews as Hitler suggested). However, I have read elsewhere that there was a great deal of censorship of war news which gave a false impression that Germany was doing far better in the conflict than it actually was and the underlying economic issues were not being reported. This was the background to the \\"stab in the back myth\\" in which Germans believed that they were betrayed by the surrender by the German government. It was a betrayal of sorts but not the one that Hitler thought.

B0090SI4OC|2.0|With \\"Twilight\\" behind her, Stephenie Meyers has moved onto another of her novels that had its film rights snatched up. After the tremendous success of \\"Twilight\\" it was probably a given that her fortune would continue. \\"Twilight\\" was more of a phenomenon than a critical success and Meyers seemed to tap into exactly what teen audiences are looking for, a little action, a little fantasy and a whole lot of young males without shirts. Oh, and don't forget love triangles.<br /><br />\\"The Host\\", to Meyer's credit, is nothing like her \\"Twilight\\" series. There are no vampires or werewolves, but there are aliens who have, for the most part, taken over the world. If you have seen the movie \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" (original, remake or second remake), you get the gist of what kind of aliens we are dealing with, although not near as scary.<br /><br />Saoirse Ronan plays Melanie/Wanderer/Wanda a girl who leads a resistance with her brother and love interest Jared, played by young hunk Max Irons. When the alien invaders capture her, she's implanted with the soul of one of those aliens and is given a new name, Wanderer. Yet, for some reason Melanie is stronger than most and the two personalities co-exist in the same body. It's all sort of complicated but the jostling that goes on, secretly between Wanderer and Melanie is the most interesting part of the movie. Not to mention, it was a creative and different way for Meyers to insert one of her most important ingredients for success; the love triangle.<br /><br />\\"The Host\\" is at its core, just a different take on the \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" story line. Instead of death and helplessness, \\"The Host\\" focuses on hopefulness and handsome teenage boys fighting over two souls in one girl. The bad thing is, I was hoping for a few more death and helplessness moments. Anything would have helped to spruce things up. The movie is slow and uninteresting. The director and writers hoped that the relationship between Melanie/Wanderer and her two men, Ian and Jared, would be enough to suffice, but it isn't. The music score doesn't help much either, but I sure would love to pull that music score, put it to CD and use it for those difficult nights when sleep is troublesome.<br /><br />Honestly, I think there was some potential with this film, but it would have served better had it been presented as a television mini-series instead of a money making follow up to \\"Twilight\\". They banked on the fact that those same loyal followers would throw their money in Meyer's direction again, but instead they most likely only hurt the Meyers brand. Plus, had it been a television mini-series, it could have been broken up with commercials and other jazzier programming.erer and her two men, Ian and Jared, would be enough to suffice, but it isn't.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Since i also own the pc version of minecraft, i thought that i would be dissapointed with the pocket edition. However, i found it was almost as fun as the Pc version, with a focus more on building than exploring. The controls were easy to use and the game runs smoothly. I wish that there would be more blocks, but I can imagine that the pocket edition isn't on the top of the list for Mojang. All in all, minecraft pocket edition is a fun game that will keep you occupied for hours. Happy Mining!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|The movie was good but the seemed to use more animatronics for characters and it took away a bit of the reality that the Rings had.
B00123G51C|5.0|Lovers of jazz must own this collection!  Dave Brubeck will always be remembered  for being one of the greats, and this collection proves that he was...especially live.  If you love bop as I do, you'll be very pleased once this is in your playlist!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|By page number on a kindle!! I've never seen a dictionary you can't reference alphabetically. What were you thinking? What a waste  of everyone's time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey receives 5 stars from me.  I not only love the plots and actors, but all of the scenery, clothing and attention to detail.  It's a wonderful history lesson too.  I could watch it for hours.  Bring on Season 4!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works very well! Fast and very easy to use. Displays information that is useful. Better than the Weather Channel app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like feeding her. I like racing her. I like playing with her. I think it is a fun game to play.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a fun awesome game lots of different little minigames that are simple this is a must have app
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|This movie was pretty good for a lot of different ages. My kids found it hilarious for the most part, but they don't believe in the tooth fairy or Easter Bunny or Santa (so no disappointments).
B006CR2PI0|4.0|I love Demi Moore.  This is a very good movie although not her best.  I like it even better on Blu-ray!
B004NELBPC|4.0|I have the Huffington Post on both my iPad and Kindle Fire.  I like it much better on the iPad.  As soon as I wake up in the morning, I read the short news clips that interest me.  Since downloading and using the app, I rarely watch MSNBC, CNN or Fox on TV or the internet.  The apps gives me just enough information about what is happening in the US.
B004TJ1GVK|5.0|I know this movie is not produced that well and the acting is not great.....but I still love it!  I love Las Vegas and this movie shows a lot of that.  The Blu-ray picture is fabulous and it's just a fun movie!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook app is not as user friendly on the iphone, iPad, Kindle Fire as it is on a computer but it is a useful app on all devices.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book.  There is humor, sadness and family.  I have not seen the movie...I hope it is half as good as this book!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Great movie.  I have seen it in the theatre and was not expecting much, but they did a good job on this one.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Antifragile is like a solid compass for the lifelong journey!<br />This book is full of naturalistic wisdom, blended with experience, simple & honest..!<br /><br />Nassim uses such a nice language... all flavoured with historical wisdom, humility and the flow of the nature.<br />Most sections remind me this quote: \\"the most perfect actions echo patterns found in nature\\".<br /><br />Thanks to Nassim Taleb for crafting such a monumental work (Antifragile!), and leading a mission of naturalistic simplicity.<br />I strongly recommend this book to everyone, especially for ones who live with an entrepreneurial lifestyle!
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|One of the best shows i watched!!! Right up there with breaking bad,game of thrones, and walking dead! Highly recommend!
B000E5N6LG|4.0|Nice to have both... and according to Terry Ike Clanton... great nephew to Ike Clanton... who I know... this one is more accurate.  But wouldn't the family of Ike Clanton say just that?
B008MWBY6W|5.0|Good size, not overly large or small.  Perfect for Nikon D800 + 28-300mm lens.  It is a deal.  The quality is good and much better than many big name brand holster case in similar size.
B0087EACJK|4.0|This was a nice maze/stick man game. You have to run, jump, and move the different sections of the maze to collect the coins and key before getting to the door to beat the level. There is a time limit for each level so it makes the game challenging. The music was nice in a simple, calming way. The graphics look like most of the graphics for other stick men type games--simple but at least well animated.<br /><br />I thought this game would be too easy after the first few levels, but it does get harder as you progress. The rules were nicely placed within the game and easy to understand. I had no issues playing this game on my kindle fire that I noticed. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle and maze games.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Has very good graphics and a nice theme.  You definitely have too work at finding the next move. Is not a waste of time if you enjoy a real challenge.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's just like the old fashion solitaire I really like it a lot if you like the old fashion one you'll like this one
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Amazing game and money well spent! Downloadable Necroa Virus gives that lovely bioengineering zombie virus feeling for everyone to enjoy a Zombie Apocalypse in their own way. Both Addictive and fun, it is a MUST HAVE APP!
B008133MDK|5.0|Writing, acting, directing, photography, and editing all serve to make this contemporary adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's classics every bit as engaging as the originals! Season 3, please?
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|tried 3 times it would download but it wouldn't install the game! I was hoping that I would get Lucky like the few people who love this game. But Murphy's law was with me!
B00BESKTMG|3.0|The commercials really do this movie a disservice, what you get from what you expect are really very different. Mr. Iron fist is not fit for a martial arts film at all; take him away and you get a much better cheesy martial arts film, which would be more tolerable.....
B005Q1W10A|4.0|My wife enjoys it very much and I have become caught up in the many subplots. The acting is excellent. I am not a fan of theater based on the 19th century humorless British class system. If there's a hint of a smile, someone must have broken a leg. That the setting is before and during WWI is no excuse for such a dour and dire depiction of life. But then, I enjoy Red Green. Our average for Downton Abbey is 4 stars.
B003IKMR0U|2.0|My daughter is Zombie crazy so I got this for her for Christmas. We tried to play it once but it is way too confusing to understand exactly what you do.
B009LDXQGW|4.0|Bought this cd for pretty much 2 songs. Love them all. Friend \\"introduced\\"  me to 'Wicked Games' and I needed the Cd right then
B008220D7S|4.0|This Is 40, the latest project from writer/director Judd Apatow, expands upon the lives of Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Apatow's real-life spouse, Leslie Mann), the quirky yet likable couple from Apatow's 2007 hit Knocked Up. The story revolves around the couple's struggles, burdens, surprises, and realization that their marriage hasn't turned out the way they envisioned.<br /><br />A comedy is only as good as it's actors and This Is 40 hits all the right marks. A low-key story such as this demands quality from it's leads and Rudd and Mann are more than up to the task. Their chemistry is utterly believable, and their characters are sincerely relatable. Their conversations and mannerisms are very indicative of how a lot of couples interact in real-life, and the issues they face are very typical of modern spouses. The couple's children (played by Apatow's real-life kids Maude and Iris) are equally entertaining to watch, and their scenes together make for some of the funniest moments in the movie. Rounding out the cast is a great comedic ensemble; Jason Segel, Melissa McCarthy, John Lithgow, Albert Brooks, Chris O'Dowd, Lena Dunham...even Megan Fox has some funny moments.<br /><br />I will say that the movie is longer than it should be by about 30 mins, but the sincerity and likability of the cast more than make up for this. Behind the film's crude humor and lengthy run-time is an honest and heart-felt story about love, companionship, and making things work.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I really like this, but can't find expansion tutorial. Ready to expand. Help, help, help. Need more words. Really cool and fun!!
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|Watched Breaking Dawn Part 1 in the theater first and decided that I had to have it for my collection at home.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I know others were disappointed in Book II in this triology, but I found it more interesting than Book I. I agree it is a bit artificial for every character in Book I to survive the Great War, in order to be able to have the children who figure heavily in Book II. Rest assured, people start dying in Book II. Maybe I like these books because I share the ethnic background of some of the main characters, and there are not all that many books written in this level of detail about Welsh people from 1910-1940.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Amusing, very well written,not all that believable, but then again it´s SF and the science behind it sound plausible enough...
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I like to read historically realistic fiction, and this book certainly meets that criterion. I think the characters are well-drawn and held my interest. My ancestors were Welsh coal miners (although they immigrated before the setting of this book), but I suspect the depiction of the miners' lives hadn't changed all that much in seventy years.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A very intense and heart wrenching end to a great series. Some parts felt lengthy compared to the other books, some rushed. However, in the end it was a nice ending. Not my fave of the trilogy but still a good read.
B0086700CM|5.0|I can only add to the already numerous positive reviews. Impressive graphics, good animation, very cool. Good play and very fun.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Gary Taubes very simple dietary advice is clearly explained. once you understand why you must eat as he says, it is easy to do, and the results are great - 21 pounds down in 7 weeks, and they have stayed off even though I'm eating 'normally' again.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Great graphics & animation. Repetitious after a while. Personally, I'm not very dexterous on these kinds of games which I often find more frustrating than fun. Still, it's free & definitely worth the cost.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this series! It's great that Amazon is able to give good quality videos of it for when I'd miss an episode. Although sometimes they'd be blurry for a few seconds but then clear right back up. Going to be a long 7mnths til it's back on again :/
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Like its predecessor, the graphics and animation are outstanding. A fun and very cool application. I can only add to the many positive reviews.
B00002MV1V|5.0|I choose this rating because I had purchased the music many years ago. I have always enjoyed the musical styling of George Duke, I'd often emulate the bass riffs in the music and how this jazz-funk artist combined the instrumental styles that make his music a classic.<br />If you want jazz fusion-funk, this is the artist, this is his work, and this is his gift to the jazz world.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|very funny and  original.  thanks for the good service.  very pleased with this product and with this efficient service.<br />enough
B002ZG97EC|5.0|My kids had worn out their old dvd from watching it so many times. Then this came along, meaning they can not only watch it on their DVD player but also on our widescreen TV in the living room. We can also download it onto our laptops so they can watch it on long trips. They can never get enough of the &#34;yellow guys&#34; as they call them.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love It.....All the features I could ever want and then some. Love the large numbers and the ability to dim the light to avoid distraction. Highly recommend.
0547884591|4.0|I'm liking the content a lot and I read it every night. I'm learning a lot of seemingly meaningless stuff but a lot of good stuff that can be applied to everyday life. I'm only 100 pages in but enjoying it thus far.<br /><br />My only beef is that there are some of his claims which has no proof that he actually did. Not even pictures to prove his claims. It feels like he is just blowing smoke up everyone's ***es.
B00136JS12|4.0|How loved is this album? I was listening to it recently and realized that my local classic rock station plays literally every single track from this album on a regular basis. How many bands, from any era, can make the claim that one of their studio albums not only gets regular airplay, but gets regular airplay of every song on the album?
B007HC3LHS|5.0|geat book, page turner and loved the way she jumped back and forth between past and present! will definately read more books by this author
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Wonderfully sad, beautiful and dark. With a vibrancy that only childhood nightmares can<br />afford.  May Pi never dream of anything but lovely dreams of food.
B008Y73940|5.0|Was surprised to find it on Prime which made it better! The Amazon streaming through my wifi bluray player was perfect. Will definitely use these feature again.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|emeli sande,is an amazin U.K. singer,lyrics are relatable and universal,with astonishing voice, I'm a fan, I  even bought this CD for a friend she loves it
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|As a mom with a toddler, it takes a lot for me to read. This book sucks you in from the beginning with a fresh new look at vampires. I was literally laughing out loud many times as well as searching for the next romance part. Very enjoyable and I will read more from this series for sure!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I love it when I first saw it I wanted it buy this game and you will love it it is addictive.
B000FBJF3M|5.0|Having just been in Rome, I really enjoyed all the descriptions of the aqua ducts and the area in Pompeii.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Having not read the Harry Potter series, I can't compare this story to J.K. Rowling's other writing.  However, it took me far too long to care about any characters or the plot of this book.  It was ok, but certainly not a page-turner for me.
B003MC5N28|5.0|The first time i read this book i was in 7th grade, i must have read it a million times since then. Awesome
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My  13 yr. old loves this game. So does my 3yr. old. (Even tho she doesn't know how to play ..lol) My teen says its better than Temple Run. I highly recommend it to anyone!!!! Download now!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone! It can really awaken you inner sexual beast... yet in a way that feels safe. It really make us dream & think.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Daniel Day Lewis was, as always, fabulous --- but the movie was too long.  And we knew how it was gonna end.  I was bored.
B008KZVNFS|5.0|Superb acting, engaging plot, fantastic costumes...well written dialog.  I love Downton Abbey and thought I might like this too.  I was right!  Well done BBC series and if you like period costume dramas with action and romance...I think you will enjoy Parade's End.
B0087EACJK|1.0|really boooorrring. I cant stand games that require very little logic. this is just a jump and run game. no real logic needed
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is just another classic book that holds your attention and makes you want to not put it down! Such a good series!!!
1607066017|4.0|This is a cool variation on the Romeo and Juliet theme with a galactic scope and very quirky nuances. I found it touching and at times funny. Only two perplexing aspects: How the hell can the Compu/TV heads eat and breathe? Why both the states at war should be such obsessed in obliterating a couple of deserters? And what about some more details in the background, that sometimes looks blurry and unfinished? By the way, if The Will was into beings like The Stalk, no wonder he didn't find nothing suitable on the  pleasure planet!
B007M45PMU|5.0|One of the best albums of the year! I like Stubborn Love, Ho Hey, Big Parade, Submarines, and Flowers in Your Hair. It is reminiscient of Bob Dylan. The songs are very upbeat and catchy with a few memorable ballads.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Esta segunda temporada, si bien con algunos cambios de los libros, es excelente. Muy buenas interpretaciones por parte de Alfie Allen y &#34;Catelyn Stark&#34;.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|it's an easy and fun game but I don't like the fact that every time I launch the game it asks me to install the &quot;new and exciting update&quot; but when I click it to install there's no update to be installed. Also sometimes the game lags causing failure in ship expeditions and land expension quest is buggy (eventho I'm purchasing land expensions it does not count towards the quest!). These are minor inconveniances and i would still recommend playing it. especially if you enjoy playing games like &quot;American settler&quot; or &quot;ice age village&quot;
B00B29J0I6|5.0|This is a really great game. I first downloaded the lite version and we ended up buying the full version a few days later. My seven year old and three year old both love it. My older child doesn't have a very hard time playing it, but it can be a bit tricky for my toddler. It's a really fun game for them and I even enjoy helping them with some of the levels.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is an excellent product. The presentation, the talent and audio are first class. I've bought several copies to give as gifts. Alfie Boe is excellent.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I got this game for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it. There are a lot of characters and hair styles for her to play with and create. She loves all the hair styling tools and colors.
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|Good! It does what it is suppose to do, read floppy discs. You can not go wrong with this one!
B00BI73CVI|2.0|First of all, the acting and costumes were AMAZING! That being said, the singing throughout the ENTIRE movie really killed it for me.  I realize that this is a musical, however, the need to sing every word limited the amount of dialog possible.  I felt that many important twists in the plot were glazed over or barley explained at all by the songs.  If you want singing throughout the entire story, I suggest that you watch an actual theater performance.  The movie adaptation with Liam Neeson was much, much better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game but me and my friends think it's kinda a replica of temple run but this game is really fun my high score is 2110699 this is a great game mostly everybody thinks so . This game is awesome my friend says it's really really awesome I asked her and she loves it
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|If you like music or are a fan or Rock from the 70's on, you will truly appreciate the rocumentary. It's well directed and has a killer soundtrack. I highly recommend!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|In addition to the wonderful characterization by Daniel Lewis, the film provided me with a completely new perspective and insight into President Lincoln. Extremely well done film
B008AK8FHM|3.0|.It was an interesting story coming from a Brain Specialist.<br />The free will Idea was his conclusion but he only experienced the free will during the time he was in the total presence of God.  In that realm there is only one will, God's will!<br />On earth you have to surrender your will to Gods will if you really want to be free.<br />Jesus is our example in the Garden where He was betrayed, your will be done not mine.<br />You see what happened to Lucifer when he tried free will, Not to mention Adam and Eve.<br />In Conclusion, It is written for brain surgeons in the latter part of the book.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I actually received the ARC for the sequel, Walking Disaster, so I knew I had to read this one first before sinking into the next one.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire is told from the perspective of Abby (or \\"Pigeon\\" as she is affectionately nicknamed by Travis) as she maneuvers through college and her love life, which is kind of like a mix of a romcom with Fight Club. Travis is a man ho for lack of a better term, and he is the most glorified fighter in a secret betting fight club. He sees Abby for the first time there, and their love/hate relationship starts in that moment. He won't leave her alone, and she is determined to ignore him because he's everything that's she's tried to leave behind. Will they make their way together or will it all end... in disaster? Sorry, couldn't help it.<br /><br />I would characterize this book more as new adult than young adult and would recommend that no one under 18 should read it for graphic violence and sexual encounters. This book is well written and the characters pop off of the page. I read it from cover to cover--pacing is definitely not a problem. The characters are really well described and three dimensional, and McGuire pulls out some twists that I did not expect but really liked.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with this book is while there is no doubt that this couple was sizzling hot, they were also probably the two most dysfunctional people I've ever read about. I think Abby was probably right in that they'd end up just destroying each other. Maybe years of counseling would help them, but would it be worth it? If I were Shepley or America (their respective best friends), I'd give them a berth of at least 50 feet... maybe even a few continents. I also have to agree with other reviewers that this may give the wrong message to teens about love-- if I were a parent, I'd really have an honest discussion about relationships and what is okay and what is not. Having a guy fight for and over you using physical violence is not something to adore and admire.<br /><br />That said, I really enjoyed this book overall, but couldn't help but be relieved that 1) I didn't have to watch them tear each other apart any longer and 2) that I don't have a relationship like theirs.ical violence is not something to adore and admire.<br /><br />That said, I really enjoyed this book overall, but couldn't help but be relieved that 1) I didn't have to watch them tear each other apart any longer and 2) that I don't have a relationship like theirs.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I absolutely LOVED the first season and the prequel. Do I miss Andy W.? Yes I do, very much. It goes without saying he OWNED the role. He brought to the performance a certain spark, an intense passion that was conveyed in every expression. Did Liam fill his shoes... not entirely. But did Liam step up to the plate? Yes he did. It was no easy feat to replace Andy, No one really could. I'm not sure if even Brad Pitt could have picked up the sword and taken over the role after Andy. So, I'm willing to give Liam a break. The storyline was amazing and kept me highly engrossed and entertain with each new episode. I'm a huge fan of the way Spartacus is filmed, although, I believe they used the \\"phantom camera\\" a bit too much. I loved watching the back-stabbing between the Romans as well as the camaraderie between the rebels. One of my favorite aspects was bringing the Champion from the prequel to fight alongside the Champions from the original season.  Great series all around. :D
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I kept wondering where it was headed, which direction the book was taking.  But...the whole point is enjoying the ride, not the destination.
B0015DROBO|4.0|A thriller from the first page to the last!  I enjoyed the development of such complex characters, plots, and subplots.
0525953728|5.0|Very good read.  Is loaded with details and experiences of the events.  I have recommended this book to several friends of mine and they couldn't put it down either.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Be a &#34;movie Goer&#34; - Check your brain at the door and If you can handle Matthew McConaughey you will enjoy this. Total fun...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good game. Once you start you can't put it down. I would recommend this game to people of all ages
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This HBO documentary is moving and illustrative of what it means to live with Autism.  Claire Danes gives a Golden Glob-worthy performance as Temple Grandin, a young woman fighting to adjust to a world she does not always understand or even participate in.  Unable to pick up social cues or to learn responses to social situation, Temple learns it all the hard way, with the enduring support of her mother and her aunt.  What she lacks in understanding human interaction, whe more than makes up for in her sensitivity and understanding of animal behavior.  Evokes both tears and laughter.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Absolutely enjoyed every minute of this game. Made you use your brain. The puzzles aren't easy but also not impossible. The map I really liked, didn't leave you guessing where to go next. On to buy my next game! Enjoy :)
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|This is a great movie that is well worth the time spent watching. Honestly might like this better than knocked up.
0446572985|5.0|Another excellent Baldacci novel. This one sure held my interest. It moved right along and caused me to want to turn the pages for more. Robie is an interesting character and an assassin with a conscience for a change, that knows right from wrong. Crossing paths with a bright teenage girl, helping her and himself stay alive utilizing his special skills in a believable manner helped the story along. No super weapons or powers. Only problem with these type stories is that it seems the assassin never seems to know who is above him in his chain of command and only knows his handler. If something is amiss he has no one to turn to or question. It is always blindly obey orders or die. Robie survives this and has some narrow escapes that just made me want to find out what happened next. Baldacci just gets better and better. I look forward to the next \\"Robie\\" novel.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I feel like it was a bit redundant and (spoiler) im kind of up set about her choosing gale because the reader doesn't know him and i wouldn't have stayed upset if it wasnt for the fact that in the next book we STILL didnt get to know him and then she didnt even act like she made a choice at all (end) but anyway i liked the slightly predictable twist and it was certainly interesting but katniss went from gaining strength back to whiny and it was kind of annoying. It was a let down compared to the first one but it was alright something about it did keep me going, probably this completely new foreign world that's the setting of this series
B002NNCAJQ|3.0|Was a bit dated and hard to get into.  The acting was good, but what could you except from from seasoned actors like them.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|It would be good service to your customers is you would add subtitles just like netflix has, at least would help my family.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I continue to be amazed by Joe Bonamassa. He performs with a very talented group of musicians on this release, and they more than deliver An Acoustic Evening. Fantastic. If you are a Bonamassa fan you need to own this.
B004QX07G4|4.0|If you like Ellen and get her humor, you probably will like this book.  It is not an autobiography, just a collection of funny stories or anecdotes to make you laugh.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|This series just gets better and better.  The DVD offers so much with 2 tracks of commentary.  Will buy DVD after Season Six to hear commentary and extra features.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Mr. Spielberg transforms us into the perverbial \\"fly on the wall\\", and the superb acting draws you in and transports to Civil War era Washington.<br /><br />An amazing and totally enthralling movie that takes you on an emotional ride through a very dark and troubled time in our nations history. It is a lesson in politics and a glimpse of the what it really takes to be The President of OUR United States of America.
B00BGDF1FO|4.0|some of the songs they use in the boss battles makes me wonder if these were actual bands and if they are I wonder who they are.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good games but wished that you could get more points from some games. All the games are fun to play.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|At first I liked this little tool.  I was able to sharpen my Gerber Ultralight and my Gerber Paraframe fairly easily.  But then I noticed that the ultralight was getting dull and I couldn't seem to sharpen it any more.  On close inspection one of the ceramic plates had chipped and it was actually dulling my knife instead of sharpening it.  I ended up going out to my shop and using my Japanese water stones to put an edge back on the knife.<br /><br />After only 2 months of use I now have a useless sharpener.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Beautiful graphics, challenging game. Would recommend this to anyone who likes puzzles and mind games. Don't know what to compare it to, don't play a lot of games.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|The graphics in this game was totally amazing, not to mention the controls were really smooth. Game design and concept= fantastic
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids are loving it and it works great on the regular Kindle Fire! Lots of fun entertainment, highly recommend!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book! I can't wait to start reading Mocking Jay!<br />Catching Fire was so Heart pounding and exciting! (; I defiantly recommend this book and the whole series! ;)
B005SVVANW|5.0|We had the best time putting this together.  We were going to glue it to a poster board & frame it, however we decided we want to put it together again!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Would not load the first two days I had it. when it did load it kept freezing.than it wouldn't close and ended up freezing my kindle completely. after that my kindle wouldn't turn on for 24 hours. complete waste of time. the only good thing about is its free.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Great movie, great cast, great story.  Great historical movie as well.  Would recommend it to anyone.  Great movie, great movie.
B00BF123WG|4.0|I've watched a couple of documentaries on how Bin Laden was found and killed, but definitely learned plenty from Zero Dark Thirty. I also would like to watch it again, because I feel like there were things I probably missed.<br /><br />The movie focuses much more on how the compound Bin Laden was staying was found than anything I've previously watched. You definitely get a good &#34;feel&#34; what CIA agent Maya was going through -- from the frustration of finding Bin Laden and her living situation.
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|It was funny in spots; it would drag on in other spots.  Watch if you are bored, no reason to watch otherwise.
B000009ED0|5.0|A solid album throughout but I would have bought it just for the I Wanna Be A Cowboy track. One of Kid Rock's best.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Very Good movie.  Great to watch in HD.  Like all the batman movies it is a little too long and drags a little in spots.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I like the combo packs as I have computers to play the dvd on and a bluray player also. I have not had time yet to go over the bonus material.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Super awesome series. If you're a fan of survival shows, then this is something you're likely to enjoy. Watch it :)
B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|I rented this movie off amazon prime. After i was charged for the movie i never got the chance to view it because it never loaded up. It kept saying we are having problems wit this title selection & to please try again later
0062014536|2.0|I really loved Delirium; in fact I read it in less than two days. It was engaging, thrilling. Then I read Pandemonium. I liked it, but did not care for the style the book was written in; all the back and forth was annoying. However, the story itself was good, so I forgave the author. Requiem is written in the same sort of back and forth style, except this time it's between Hana and Lena. If the story was well developed, I could deal with that, but it's just not. Julian is still in the book, but there is no character development with regards to him. Lena's mother is found, yet their relationship is not really developed either. The book ends without a real resolution; the book feels unfinished!! Did Ms. Oliver get bored with her own story? Did her publishers put a page limit on her final book? Who knows, but the result is a flat story that does not deliver!
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Awesome insight to the industry and verifies my decision to go into banking after a summer as a dish washer and occasional waiter !!!
B002RI9ZUE|5.0|A strong commentary of the time about women's place in society. It reminded me of Catcher in the Rye from a woman's perspective and then goes further into how the main character struggles in &#34;hospitals&#34; to &#34;get well.&#34;
B008Y73940|5.0|I really liked this movie!  It brought back a lot of memories of the way it is way down south. Great action, just everything!  I loved it!
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|I normally don't watch animated films but a review I heard on NPR made me rent it.  I wish I had seen it on the big screen.  The first half hour of this film is so unlike any film I have ever seen.  No real dialog.  Fresh approach!!!!  The story of an abandoned Planet Earth and Mankind Having grown so lazy and useless as to let machines control every aspect of their existence is presented with both stark clarity and gentle humor.  Wall-E was one of the first films I added to my library.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|If you like anything along the lines of Camelot you will love this whole series.  The hard part...wishing for my episodes!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Awesome game! Makes you think about what to do next! I highly recommend downloading this app if you like games that make you think!!!
0345803485|3.0|It was interesting I don't think I would read it again...that's why I got the books used...not something I would buy at fool cost.
B00992CF6W|5.0|To begin let me begin with my position in the world of tech and what I base my reviews on. I am a self made business man and Android application developer, I will not ever base a review on what I think about how much I need this product or how it's actually used. I base my reviews solely on the idea that it accomplishes what it is described to do.<br />  I have played the PC versions of Minecraft since alpha basic's prerelease version. I have always enjoyed the idea of games like these where you are constantly doing math without having to think about it. Being a software engineer since 13, arithmetic is my entire life. I am very big on not limiting the time our future generations spend on electronics but instead enforcing what content they are viewing and games like these inspire children to do more.<br />  THIS GAME IS NOT YET COMPLETE. Yes, I know this, and it does not bother me, but what does is the idiots complaining about it not being finished when the PC game isn't either! Rant over.<br />  The only complaint I have is I believe in having a smooth transition through platforms, but I cannot ask so much at such an early time in development. By the final I expect them to make MCPE, MCXE, and PC versions with the same world format so you can pick up your PC world and take it on the go.
0099579928|3.0|It was interesting... Nothing I think I would like to read again...that's why when I finally got it it was used.
B0087EACJK|5.0|As a FAOTD this is a no-brainer because it's fluid, well programmed and every bit as fun as the original flash game. (Not sure if same developer as the flash game, anyone know?) The difficulty ramps up quickly but the game never gets too hard. The controls are responsive and obvious. Just an enjoyable game so far and I have yet to find fault with it. Recommended!
B0084TWN9K|2.0|Maybe I just picked this up at the wrong time in my life, but I have been wanting to read Alice Munro for a while and was disappointed with this collection.  Found it very depressing.
B007BVOF8E|5.0|It is a great real life British Spy story from the 1970's.  Amazing what went on during these times between Russia and the West.
0756697875|5.0|Like all the other Lego books, super fantastic!  In fact, have you ever seen a Lego book or product that you did not love!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Very interesting and well written book. A fantasty that transports through historical periods with charm and wit.<br />Great book to read while traveling.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Watch the movie and by the end you will be amazed at how deeply this movie will touch you or someone you may know.<br /><br />Did not expect the movie to be that good!!
B00008973A|5.0|The story is as exciting as the first time, even more if you danced. watch it over and over again.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Purchased this album as a download.  I never look at the cd cases more than once after purchase so paying a third of the price for a download really makes sense.  Love their music.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Full of really smart, great pop jams and well written songs. If you like the more recent stuff like Sainthood, which I definitely do, this sounds different but maintains the awesome pop craftsmanship of that record compared to their much earlier stuff. BUY IT.
B0087EACJK|4.0|This game is quite interesting, even intriguing. Not the kind you fall in love with and can't stop playing. Rather it keeps drawing you back to better your time or plug away at the levels yet unconquered. Gameplay itself is the attraction rather than graphics, in stark contrast to other games that would be dead without beautiful graphics. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a different kind of challenge.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is a smart, well-produced, and absolutely necessary record for anybody who likes hearing different voices in hip-hop. If you're disappointed, you're not paying attention.
B00A822VDY|5.0|This movie came out when my daughter was too young to enjoy it.  What a fun movie!  And we are looking forward to the Monsters University &#34;prequel&#34; coming out this summer.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|A great read!! Captured my attention w/the 1st page & never let go til the final page...<br />I highly recommend!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Obviously 5 stars.  I've read every book, A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows, & A Dance with Dragons several times (not to mention the Ser Duncan the Tall short stories.) Every time I think that there is nothing more I can get out of these books I find something new that I missed.  This of course leads to trying to predict what will happen in the next two books. A+.  Will read again.
B0061S073A|1.0|i was annoyed I couldn't get rid of it. I did not find it user friendly. I had a hard time figuring our how it works.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Hay so I just wanted to say this game is awesome!!! It's the best  I gave it four stats because it could have a little more if the makers of the game see this u could add a update were u and friends could run at the same time to see who can get the farthest other than that awesome game definitely download!!! :)
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was an amazing book. I highly recommend it for people who like an exciting book but also confusing and sad events. If you read this you will instantly fall in love with it like I did.
1401324649|5.0|Witty, exciting, fun, fell in love with Allen and friends. Wish it went on and on....Tell all my friends.<br />Thank you Jonas.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book rocks. It's totally worth spending time with reading this book. I give it a must read. I can't wait to get started on Catching Fire.
1419705849|1.0|i mean, come on! this book is stupidly dumb witted in every aspect! if you want to have an intelligent, good book to read, don't even think of considering this book as a 'good' read. what do they talk about in this book? oh, the most brain numbingly idiotic things in the entire history of civilisation! e.t.c discos (bad influence on children like myself), love (what? if you want to know about 'love' then this is the best book you will ever read), Greg's boring, rubish life........ the reasons go on for YEARS! please, please oh please, don't waste your money on this stupid book like what i did, because unfortunately I learnt the hard way. Im going to stop trying to find ways on how on earth this dumb book even was considered to be published. In my opinion, Jeff Kinney is an absolutely RUBISH author! Even thinking about the dreary book is making me annoyed.... in fact RAGING! IT MAKES ME WANT TO PUKE ALL OVER THE BOOK! one thing: dont read.  By a frustrated year 6 pupil1 NOT GRADE UGGGGHHHH!
B008745B32|4.0|I read this many years ago, but in this reading I saw it all in a different light.  The sadness of lost youth was still there,  as was the melancholy of the changes the wars brought to England.  This time I noticed the religious aspect much more. Really loved this book.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Spell binding.  Surprise ending very upsetting at some points, wanted to stay home from work to finish reading it. Awesome
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I have watched Blade Runner countless times and consider it one of the finest films ever made.  This edition contains all the versions including the much-maligned, but, in my opinion, vastly superior Theatrical Release.  Love that monotone voice-over!  The picture is crystal clear and it is a pleasure to watch.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie is clever, retro, and very well done.  IMHO, it's the best movie Disney/Pixar has done outside of the Toy Story movies.
0470901071|5.0|I'm only about half-way through, but have found it to be very helpful and more interesting than the Cisco Press books. I purchased it because several people who've completed their CCNA have reccommended it. So far I'm impressed with the content. It has a detailed chapter on how to subnet quickly in your head, good questions at the end of the chapters that reinforce what youve learned and help you assess your current understanding of the material, and makes for a good guideline of where you stand and what you may need to bone up on.<br /><br />From what I hear Todd Lammle is one of the top guys in the industry and puts out excellent learning material.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|This is a very enjoyable &#34;campy&#34; movie.  Of course the music is great.  Like &#34;Rocky Horror Picture Show&#34; you have to realize that you're not watching it for the high drama. A fun movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game.I can make my dream house with diamond and budded(gold)Thank you Mojang and kindle fire company beacause of you kindles you put Minecraft as a app.THANK YOU!

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me guessing until the very end. Lots of surprises and twists. I recommend this book to anyone who likes thrilled and suspense.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I play this game constantly, especially on my breaks at work!! It really hells me clear my head and go back to work fresher. I love that i can stop a game and pick right back up later.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Fun game to pass the time. It will not let me connect to Facebook to get Facebook to get extra life credit.

0142418471|5.0|Being a huge John Green and David Levithan fan, I had a feeling I would enjoy their collaborative effort quite a lot. George Bernard Shaw once said that: \\"Two people getting together to write a book is like three people getting together to have a baby. One of them is superfluous.\\" Fear not, my dear fellow readers, this is not the case with Green and Levithan! They both bring quality, witticism and experience to the table, creating a story that is just as funny and heart warming as it is poignant and heart breaking.<br /><br />  So what is this story about? It's about two guys who both share the name Will Grayson. They're not related to each other in any way, they've never met before and their life styles are very different (to say the least). One Will is gay, antisocial, rough around the edges and quite frankly very difficult to like. The other one is straight, nerdy and determined to remain single (or at least relationship-free). They both carry baggage from the past that is weighing them down, affecting the relationships with people around them. Neither one knows about the other one's existence, until chance (or fate?) brings them together (and under utmost weird - and kind of hilarious, too - circumstances).<br /><br />  Both Wills were incredibly interesting to read about, though I must admit that I liked David Levithan's Will just a tiny bit more (it's the Will #2), perhaps because he was just so dark, damaged and broken. He was quite pessimistic, often rude and snappy. I loved his snarky inner monologue, and all the biting remarks he constantly threw around, even at his own mother. He wasn't mean to begin with, it was just his way of dealing with his own sexuality. Afraid of being judged and rejected, he built a wall around himself. And he obviously wouldn't have to do that if he wasn't sensitive and fragile on the inside. I couldn't help it, I was fascinated by his character.<br /><br />  John Green's Will (Will #1) was equally well developed and complex, though not as tragic as Will #2. Afraid of getting hurt, he kept a safe distance from people, pushing away everyone who got too close. On the other hand, his side-kick, Tiny Cooper, was just absolutely phenomenal (possibly my favorite character ever). Extra large, extra gay and extra fabulous, he was like a ball of positive, happy energy. His extraordinary, vibrant personality and the passages revolving around his (equally extraordinary) musical, Tiny Dancer, were what made this book for me. Don't get me wrong, I loved reading about both Wills, but without Tiny this book wouldn't be nearly as fantastic as it was.<br /><br />  One of the things I liked the most about this book was the unique way of distinguishing between the two Wills. The story is told through alternating POVs, both in first person. The chapters featuring Will #2 (Levithan's) are characterized by the complete lack of capital letters, which not only helps keep track of which Will we're dealing with at the moment, but also fits the character himself. I loved both of the narrative voices. They were raw, realistic, at times hilarious, at times utterly heart breaking. Most of all, they were so completely captivating and emotionally engaging, I couldn't help but feel affected. I didn't mind the swear words at all, I thought they were essential, ensuring the accuracy of the character depiction and further enhancing their believability.<br /><br />  Will Grayson, Will Grayson is a heartfelt and sincere book about love, friendship, heartbreak and finding oneself. A book about relationships. A story full of deep, thought provoking and meaningful themes that are relevant to every person out there - gay or straight, young or old, boy or girl. It's incisive and witty. It's grim, sad and awkward. It's hopeful and mood-lifting. Above all, it's moving, powerful and real! You can't afford to miss out on all that!ugh not as tragic as Will #2.

B00005JL0I|5.0|This was a great paradoy of the Bond movies.  I love how they answered the question of different actors playing Bond over time.<br />It went over the top at times, but it was still a great movie!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Great movies great special effects in the tradition of the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;. Great comedy, action, adventure. It's a trilogy though. It was funny I wasn't expecting that. Great movie though.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|I love Connery as Bond, but for this movie he should not have come back.  The concept of the story was a good one.  If this had been the last Bond movie before resetting the francise it might have worked better for Connery.
B002TOJHCM|1.0|Try as I may, I can not manage to get my Kindle version of this book to display in a manner that is even a little bit functional for a musician.  I was expecting to be able to have the book open on my monitor and see full pages displayed as nicely as the \\"Look Inside\\" feature for the paperback version, but apparently it doesn't work that way.  I would have been better off paying a little more to get the hard copy and then scanning it into my computer \\"the old fashioned way.\\"<br /><br />Unless you see yourself possibly getting into an argument with a friend about a particular chord sequence when you are out at the pub and want to be able to whip out your electronic device of choice to prove them wrong, I really can't recommend this one.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Adele fans this live concert was awesome, what a real artist! This concert made me laugh and cry, and get up and dance. What a beautiful soul.
B009GEPPYC|5.0|Note: I saw the PG-13 version in HD via XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />The film Rock Of Ages is a terrific rock musical starring Julliane Hough, Diego Boneta, Malin Ackerman, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, Bryan Cranston, Academy Award winner Catherine Zeta-Jones and Tom Cruise as Stacie Jaxx. The acting is top-notch and the songs are really good. My favourite songs are Paradise City (played in its entireity during the end credits), Sister Christian, I Want To Know What Love Is, Pour Some Sugar On Me, Any Way You Want It and Rock You Like A Hurricane (cut from the film, but partially heard during the latter portion of the end credits), Every Rose Has Its Thorn and Don't Stop Believin'. The choreography is outstanding. Tom Cruise literally disappears into the role, becoming Stacee Jaxx.<br /><br />Biblically speaking, there's no actual nudity, but very suggestive dancing and sensual scenes take place throughout. Stacee's entrance in the film is particularly telling of the sexual content. There's also some mild-to-moderate profanity, with one use of the f-word, but thankfully, no profaning of God's Name (ie. combination of His Name with a mild curse word), and a kiss between two men at the end of a beautiful song by REO Speedwagon, which I think was poorly used here. I lowered my eyes when they were about to kiss, so I didn't see that part. I don't see why film-makers feel the need to insert the aforementioned erotic element between two men in a movie. Just implying it the way they did during the song was enough, in my opinion. That is taking something that God designed to be between a woman and a man & perverting it. God calleth that an abomination.<br /><br />With a caution about the heavy sexual content, I recommend this movie.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 (heavy sexual content throughout including suggestive dancing, some language, drinking and brief violence).

0439023513|5.0|I had no idea what to except when picking up Mockingjay. I didn't know where the story would go or who we would meet this time. I loved that mystery and the fact that it wasn't predictable! It made for a better adventure and more of a roller coaster ride, but still keeping those little things we absolutely love.<br /><br />Katniss's new life consists of getting used to the ways of District 13 and being the main face of the now outspoken rebellion. A rebellion that has previously killed many people, and Katniss feels responsible. She wants to give people the freedom they wish for and to get Peeta back, but in doing so making the Capitol angrier is inevitable.<br /><br />Katniss is such an awesome and dynamic heroine. She's one of those heroines that girls look up to and that makes The Hunger Games series even more important to a lot of readers! She's smart and strong and ready to take on challenges handed to her no matter the cost she might pay. There weren't many new characters added, which was okay, because there was so much more to learn about the ones introduced in the previous book. I really enjoyed that.<br /><br />Like I've stated in previous reviews, I love that this series is written in more of a live-diary style. There is dialogue, but less than most novels. For me, I can connect with Katniss on more of an emotional level, which is really important and just another reason why this series is a big favorite of mine! The writing is exceptional and the storyline is unique and action-packed. Something you should definitely not overlook!<br /><br />For anyone who hasn't read the series, start now! I can say the same for readers who haven't picked up Mockingjay yet. Its an epic story and something you shouldn't pass up. You will laugh, fight, and cry with Katniss throughout all of her challenges, relationships, and personal conflict. I can't recommend it enough!<br /><br />For those who like: Dystopian, action, adventure/survival, strong heroines<br />Source: Won from Bewitched Bookworms<br /><br />Originally posted at The Book Worms.<br />[...]d at The Book Worms.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|This season continued the story and covered quite a bit of ground.  The characters were well developed and the conflicts and their resolution interesting.
B00C1E8E7E|5.0|Tyler, The Creator, the leader of the infamous \\"Odd Future\\" (aka OFWGKTA) has released his second studio album and his third album overall. How does it compare to his other two? Well, lets just say \\"Wolf\\" tops both \\"Goblin\\" and \\"Bastard\\" in almost every way imaginable.<br />In preparation for the album, Tyler released a few parts of songs only releasing one full single. Domo23 was that single, and it's immediately noticeable why he chose that song to be the lead single. It's probably his most mainstream song to date, but that's not to be taken in a negative sense at all. It's more immediately likeable than virtually any of his other songs (not saying it's his best song ever). The beat is absolutely nuts and Tyler goes harder than we've ever seen him go before. Accompanied with Domo23 was the song Bimmer, we only heard a minute of the song, but after listening to it all the way through it was not in any way a disappointment. Frank Ocean does a great job adding a bit of R&B to the mix, and it works out almost flawlessly. \\"IFHY\\" is Tyler's attempt at a love song. Though it is somewhat messed up, it works out. Jamba is one of the most fun tracks on the album. The Hodgy Beats feature was excellent and it's one of the easiest listens on the album.<br />After listening through the entire album, it's obvious that this is Tyler's best effort yet. There aren't many songs that stand out to be too different from the rest of the album, but ultimately it just works as a whole unit. The song \\"Answer\\" is almost sad as Tyler addresses his daddy issues and \\"Colossus\\" is very similar to the Eminem song \\"Stan\\". The only song that shouldn't be on the album is \\"Treehome95\\". Tyler is only in the song for roughly 30 seconds as the rest of the song is dominated  by the jazzy stylings of Coco O. And Erykah Badu. It's respectable for tyler to put that song on the album because it shows that this is his album and he's just doing what he wants with it.<br />Wolf is without a doubt Tyler, The Creator's best effort yet. It takes an incredibly skilled artist to make an album where every song is worth listening to, and even though not all of the songs will be your favorite, you'll want to listen to it all the way through several times.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />Must Download Tracks:<br />Domo23<br />Answer<br />IFHY<br />Party Isn't Over/Campfire/Bimmer<br />Jamba

B001NLL8LA|4.0|Reacher takes on New York as we know it today, with both shadowed and competing agencies intent on keeping us safe from terrorists. A stark depiction of the risks inherent in our freedoms, and what might be needed to defend them.
