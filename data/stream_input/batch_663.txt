B00007KWI9|5.0|I listened to this album often in my high school days. Yes, under the influence. The two epic covers here are wonderful (\\"Every Little Thing\\", \\"I See You\\"). The essence of a mind-exploring experience. Today, I still can't wrap my head around this album. I should dig it out again for another go-'round...in a hind-sight way. Five stars!
B000AS4L16|5.0|This Lenten season, I've taken up the topic of the Holocaust for a fuller review than the stuff that generally comes out on PBS (though I do seem to recall them running this very film at one time or another).  Without any actual photographs or film clips from the 1940's, Lanzmann gives us the best portrait through the oral histories that I've yet to encounter in the visual media.  It was a bit annoying at times to wait for the interpreter to translate languages such as Polish into French, but the German part had substantial impact, since I claim to \\"speak German\\" and wish to study it more.  I've been through the whole film as in the 4-disc set, and have started doing the separate discs again.  Especially interesting to me was the extensive coverage of central and eastern European rail systems, with the fine assortments of how they looked in 1985.  I want to take another trip to that part of the world and see what it's like today (e.g., is there still such use of horses in Poland?).   <br /> <br />What gets me the most, I think, is that my overall impression of the way Europeans live is as a much more earnest, sincere and authentic style than some of the phoniness we put up with in America, but then they got into all of this, didn't they?  Mass delusion, persuasion and compulsion seem possible anywhere among humanity.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|This movie drove me crazy.    First you have a father allowing his two boys to have access to a rifle without any basic instructions in safe gun handling.  Pure idiocy.  Then you have two boys who are stupid enough to shoot at a moving bus.  Then you have a shooting victim in the 21 century that can't get medical help.  Doesn't Morrocco have a single helicopter?  Then you have a Nanny who is so stupid that she takes the two kids she's watching to a foreign country without permission.  Coming back to the U.S. the Nanny's son decides to run from the Border Patrol for no known reason.  Finally, in the end, after the tragedy is played out, the boy throws down the rifle in disgust, as if the rifle had possessed him and caused the entire debacle, cleansing himself of all responsibility for his stupid (stupid even for a little boy) actions.    I don't want to pay money to watch stories about the bad choices made by dumb people.  At least other bad movies try to be intelligent, but Babel incorporates people's idiocy into the story lines.  This movie was extremely painful to watch.
0141301155|3.0|When I was a kid and much taken by Gene Wilder, the Candy Man, as Willy Wonka, I considered buying the original Charlie book, as having a fuller exposition of the tale.   <br /> <br />Then comes 2005, with that horrid Johnny Depp portrayal, and I finally say, \\"enough!\\" and buy the Dahl book.  Well, they're right; the Charlie movie is a more faithful recreation of this book, which isn't saying a lot.  It's a little kids' book, and I suppose that was Dahl's intended audience, but I always thought there was more to those characters. <br /> <br />Maybe it was just an illusion, and the work of David Wolper in 1971.  I should have stopped there. <br /> <br />Call this one 3.4 stars.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|I love Michael Mann's films.  Both Heat and Collateral provided stellar performances, proper gun handling and technique and decent screenplays. <br /> <br />Miami Vice the movie was a complete disaster.  The acting was stiff, almost like cartoon characters.  Granted, the movie didn't have masters like De Niro or Pacino, but I expected a lot more from Foxx and Farrell.  The supporting cast was even worse.  And what's up with the screenplay?  There's this scene where one of the female cops threatens an informant with throwing him out a window.  Talk about idiotic empty threats.  In Heat, while interrogating Ashley Judd's boyfriend, the cops intelligently interrogates the subject by leveraging him with the threat of extradition to another state where he would be automatically sent back to prison on a parole violation if he didn't cooperate.  Now that's a threat with a brain behind it.  And then you have the .50 cal sniper rifles.  My impression that it was gross over kill and sensationalist like the typical Hollywood use of Desert Eagle hanguns.  M14s would have made more sense given the possibility of having to be utilized for both sniper and up close work.  And I'm sorry, but Gong Li looked terrible.  I really like Asian women, but she looked like she got up without putting on any makeup and didn't get enough sleep. <br /> <br />When I watch a Michael Mann film, I expect to see a modern day classic.  I expect realism intended for a thinking audience.  If I want to watch the typical Hollywood tripe, then I can just go to the theater and watch whatever is playing at the multiplex. <br /> <br />The old Miami Vice series had better acting, better gun handling (Don Johnson's Weaver stance), better story lines and much better character development. <br />
B000K4WLXA|5.0|If you're wondering if you should buy this movie AGAIN. I say go for it. The DVD is a limited edition version with a few new added features including a menu change and Last Order with is a pretty good anime movie. Not to mention that when you get the box in your hands you just have that urge that it's too perfect to mess up. Well worth the price.
B0002OERI0|5.0|It would seems easier in this day and age.  Punk/Pop music with somewhat articulate lyrics.  Why is it so few bands can pull it off?  Green Day does, and in spades
B000M4RG42|4.0|The movie required your total attention to keep track of what time frame you were in. The constant switching did not enhance the movie. Having said this, I enjoyed the movie. The history was correct and the characters real. I would recommend this movie to the serious history or war buff.
0060507772|5.0|I was pleasently suprised with this one. It was one of the few Discworld books that I had not yet read, so I forked over the $14 for a copy. Once I got it, I realized that $14 wasn't a bad deal.  <br /> <br />Every other page had an illustration, the paper was thick and glossy, and the book was more in the form factor of a conversation piece for your coffee table than a novel, to say nothing of the story, which was of course wonderful.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I am SOO in love with Corinne's music.. it is so soothing and original. I light my candles and put on her CD and just relax.
B00005JMYI|5.0|I really don't know why this is one of my favorite comedies. I love old comedy movies, too. Chaplin, The Marx Brothers, W.C. Fields, and many more. This movie just makes me laugh so hard everytime I watch it. This is probably Will Ferrell's best comedy yet. If you like the type of comedy where everything doesn't have any point but it's hilarious, this is your movie along with Dodgeball. <br />I wish they would release the PG-13 cut of the movie in widescreen.

B000H0MKGK|3.0|I was disappointed in this CD - Mayer seems to sing depressing after depressing song.  I am a big fan of his, but not this CD.
B000MNP2K8|4.0|I loved the Bond franchise into my early 20's but it seemed like the plots/brushes with death/stunts became complete farce. Rather than Austin Powers spoofing Bond, it seems like later Bond films were spoofing earlier ones.<br /><br />Not so with Casino Royale. My wife described it best when she called Daniel Craig's incarnation of Bond, and the story itself, as \\"gritty.\\" If a Bond movie could be described as \\"dark,\\" Casino Royale would fit that description.<br /><br />Noticeably absent from this movie are the laughable escapes from confinement/death and the cliche one-liners. Craig's Bond is an amazing fighter and cold, hard killer, much like Jason Bourne (Bourne Identity & Supremacy) and relies little on gadgets. The only weapons I recall him using were a knife and a handgun w/a silencer. This movie was carried by the characters, not the machines (though there were some sweet cars in it.)<br /><br />Of course James is still a ladies' man. He wouldn't be Bond if he weren't. But there's an all-business, cold quality to his romantic encounters. Like the Bond girls in the previous movies, 007 uses sex first as a tool and second for pleasure.<br /><br />All in all, Casino Royale might be the best Bond movie of the last 30 years. It certainly is in the top 5 of the entire franchise.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|Okay, I'm not a Will Ferrell fan, and that should be said right up front. I know I'm in the minority here, but when a six year old boy acts like a six year old boy, it's cute. When a grwon man does it, it's vaguely diturbing....so for me, Ferrell never delivers. Make that rarely... <br /> <br />Because here at last is proof that not only can he be funny, but he has the acting chops to boot. Casting aside the ludicrous and by now formulaic persona he inhabits in other films, here he plays a lead character with heart, sincerity and all the subtleties and nuance to make it \\"pop\\" The entire cast if wonderful, but you should expect that of them, so it really is Ferrell that makes this such a surprise. Add to that the fact that he actually steals the show, and even manages to steal the show from Dustin Hoffman (where did that come from?), and this is a treat. <br /> <br />The story itself is fantastic also. Very well written, so that the twists manage to still surprise you a little, while giving the viewer easy signposts to follow. Other reviews have covered the synopsis, but I will add that to see a movie, much less a comedy with a story again was refreshing to say the least. Very well concieved and reaized, this is a grand exploration of literature, choices and the ways we can affect one another. But, if you're looking for lame gross out shtick and shock value, go rent one of the interminable and tired Scary Movie flicks, because here you'll find another, more subtley realized comedy, and one that is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud, if you're paying attention. <br /> <br />Overall, the first comedy in a long time to get five stars from me, and far and away the best movie Ferrell has ever done! Highly recommended!
0689825498|5.0|I have been reading this book to my daughter since she was seven months old. She was already used to other lift-the-flap books and immediately took on to this one.  <br />What we both love: <br />1- She loves the flaps because they are just the right size for her hands. I like them because they are not too big like in her other books (the larger the flaps, the easier to rip!) <br />2- Simple, straightforward text with short lines on each page.  <br />3- Great colors.  <br />4- Repitition throughout and babies love consistency! <br /> <br />This became her favorite very quickly and 5 months later, still is!  <br /> <br />A definite book to buy! <br /> <br />
B0001MDP3G|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie Cold Mountain, I often watch it again. This movie to me is one of the few movies that you can really lose yourself in. The charecters really come alive and you find yourself caring about them. The scenery is really beautiful and the old time american folk music is great too.The film does have some nudity and violent scenes so its not for younger viewers. Overall a beautiful film with a moving story about a time when America was much younger.
1881273156|5.0|My husband and I read this together before we got married.  It really helped us put into words what can normally be very hard to express.  Read it yourself and find out!  I recommend this book to everyone!
B000002UVX|4.0|THe songs are not as good as the Experience ones and the scat singing Buddy Miles can be a little annoying (I also prefer Hendrix as even a singer over him)... nonetheless, this is vital Hendrix and the guitar is stellar. Hendrix continued to soar and improve as a guitarist (though it's hard to imagine the best electric guitarist improving...) and it's really sad that we lost him, and who knows what places he would've taken us to had he lived longer:(
0451527046|4.0|This book is good, has it's fair share of excitment and adventure, but it being a classic does have it's boring moments.  These are the periods that just drag on and on with description or with attempt at building anticipation.  This might just be a problem to me because I have grown up in a day and age where the build up has to be darn good to keep the population's attention.  All in all, because of it's classic status and it's effect on literature and movies about pirates, I would definatly recommend this book.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|A release like this and the Filmore concert really make one wonder about what else hasn't been released (I'm excited about the archives set supposed to come out this year of course!) This is a very intimate concert and reaffirms (as an article printed on the sleeve notes) that Neil is one of the most genuine artists that there is. As a prior reviewer noted, Neil's voice is not what is generally considered \\"good,\\" yet it is ideal for his music and an idispensable part of it; his songs rarely sound half as good sung by anyone else. His voice doubtlessly suits his songs perfectly and the clarity of his vocals on this recording is truly special. If you have no other live Neil albums (which is criminal, he's the best live rock artist), then you will be amazed that unlike several artists, his live discs are not just collector's items, but vital parts of his music. The songs are the same songs, and the studio versions are still tremendous, but he brings something else to the songs (though his versions are uncannily true, as far as reproducing the melodies, remembering his lyrics etc., unlike several artists), and his stripped down, no nonsense approach to these songs is refreshing. All of the songs are well done and at least worth a listen. Sure the \\"Down By the RIver\\" and \\"Cowgirl\\" rock like nothing else when Neil plays his monster solos on the album and Filmore versions, but they are also beautifully done here in shortened, solo acoustic arrangements. Neil's songs are really a part of him and one senses this throughout the recording. If you are a Neil fan, don't hesitate to check this one out, and if you're not a Neil fan, then, eh if you're not a Neil fan, there may be little hope for you... j/k if you're not a Neil fan, check this out anyway, maybe it will convert you.
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|This CD is even better than the 1st Scissor Sisters release!!!  WOW, WOW, WOW!!!
1582701709|2.0|Unless you're nine years old and have been living in a tree, this book isn't worth the money. It's nothing more than a slick rehash of what your mother has been telling you for years--that a positive attitude will serve you better than a negative attitude. I intensely disliked the fact that the book stresses materialism; i.e., lose weight and you'll be happy, win the lottery and you'll be happy, or acquire a five million dollar mansion and you'll be happy.  <br /> <br />But what happens if you don't get what you asked for? Well, the author has left herself a neat little exit hole by telling you that if your wish doesn't come true, it's because you didn't really, REALLY believe it would.

0930289234|4.0|This collection has a great reputation, being heralded as one of the greatest novels of all time. It's got a great story, fantastic art work, and it really is a page turner.<br /><br />I was however, at times, somewhat waiting for it to really grab me. It didn't seem to do that, but for some unknown reason I just couldn't put it down. It's dark in places and a true graphic novel.<br /><br />It is a must have for all comic and great drama fans. The characters are compelling, and addictive, and finding yourself thinking about the book days later is a nice surprise.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good read. I do think however, that it was maybe a little too over rated. Don't get me wrong, I loved it, I just thought it was going to be a little different. So approach Watchmen with a completely blank canvas of an attitude and sit back and enjoy!
1589269063|3.0|The audio, in my opinion, is slow and dry.  I found it hard to listen to and actually didn't finish the cd's....
B0000A1RJI|5.0|My son is really into the pirates movies...we have watched them both about 20 times each since christmas.  My son is also a music lover, so I purchased this CD mostly for his listening.  However, I think that I have listened to this as much as he has.  If you are a fan of the movies it is great!!!  Anyone who likes big exciting classical type music pieces would also enjoy this.  The music for this movie was brilliantly written!  We had bought the Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest music CD from the store and we don't hardly listen to that one at all-it is not as good as this CD.
B0000E6XH3|4.0|The music in the beginning is the best part.  If you are buying the movie for the story line forget about it because the ending sucks.  But if you are buying this because you are a true Daft Punk fan this is a great buy for a good price.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Its just an amazing series and I and my wife were hooked on it for severel weeks before we caught up with season three. <br />Its best to watch it on DVD because it maintains the flow and thats what makes LOST so interesting
B000000W5N|5.0|This is probably, next to Led Zeppelin 2, one of the best rock albums ever recorded. Want to conjure the devil for an afternoon of lust, just put on \\"Can You Hear Me Knocking?\\" or \\"Brown Sugar.\\"  Only \\"Rocks Off\\" from Exile on Main Street can approximate the feral craze of \\"Brown Sugar\\" and Richards' nasty guitar licks. \\"Sister Morphine\\" is just great songwriting,  I'll never give up my copy of this gem.
1420925288|4.0|I ordered the book having read it already, just to have it for my library. It has a beautiful geometric pattern cover, which looks better on the computer screen than in real life. I prefer the hard-cover edition, but this one will make a nice, inexpensive, but meaningful gift.
B000AP04OM|5.0|One of the most beautiful, romantic love scenes that gives me goosebumps is when Maria and the captain are out in the garden declaring their love for each other.  The scenery, the music, everything in this movie is gorgeous.
B000022TSH|5.0|A classic right from the start, this film gives you the sense of the old 30's and 40's film noir.  Made 30 years ago, it still feels contemporary today and will always be a modern classic piece of excellent film-making. <br />For anyone who enjoys authenticity of the movie in the retelling of the novel, including the setting, feeling of the story, and the atmosphere it generates, this is a masterpiece.  I recommend it highly!
B000063DHK|5.0|Telling people I'm listening to Iron Maiden often gets an odd reaction.  A raised eyebrow, a curious laugh or some other tick tells me that the other person has never enjoyed the heavy bass and thumping rock beat of an Iron Maiden tune.  One good listen will teach you that Iron Maiden is more than just a thumping head banger's band.  This band weaves music with such power and energy, it's hard not to get sucked into the excitement.  This album is for anyone who enjoys letting the music raise their spirits and energize their souls.
B00000IL1K|5.0|I first came across this album my senior year in college. It quickly found its way into the landscape of my daily life---I wrote over 200 pages in the wee hours of the morning to it, drove down the east coast, worked out at the gym, and dreamed to the tracks on this cd. Beautiful,soothing, and inspiring this is an album that never grows old.
B000089RV6|5.0|I can remember when I would get in trouble for playing these \\"devil\\" songs.  Now, they're background music for top commercial spots.  My, how times have changed.  This album contains some of the rock iconic songs from the 80s.  It's a must have for anyone who grew up with a wild side, a bit of a tendency for danger, or for anyone who needs a little pick me up.  Enjoy!
0884271153|3.0|Goldratt takes us through he paces again, but this time not quite as ground breaking and informative as the Goal.  Of course the Goal remains standard reading for all young managers in any sort of manufacturing environment, and the TOC is a baseline concept that they should wrap their mind around.  This book is good and adds a little refinement on top of the previous books, but should definitely be down in the pile.  Start with the Goal, and keep this book on the low priority / rainy day list.
B00005A46T|5.0|This was the first Slipknot album I have purchased and I'm proud of it. I was wondering how I would like it considering I never really paid attention to them before and listened to bands like Metallica and System of a Down alot but nothing as heavy as this album. I decided to pick it up after an ex-girlfriend of mine showed me The Heretic Anthem.  <br /> <br />Although not for the squeemish (as most extreme metal albums are) I say this is a must own for fans of heavy and extreme metal. It didnt sound anything like nu-metal to me.  <br /> <br />Some may think the excessive amount of lyrics about breakups and love are not the best option for any band to choose but I dont mind. <br /> <br />I don't want to bombard you with cliche's but let me just put it this way: the way Corey sings/screams alongside Mick's guitar may actually be a very well epic sound. <br /> <br />Check out the track clip previews, especially track 6, the Heretic Anthem. Some of the previews dont catch the best parts of the songs but I'd highly recommend this album to any heavy/extreme metal fan.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is quite simply the most amazing thing you will ever watch on your television. Seriously. It's that good. Your jaw will drop and you will find yourself saying, \\"Oh my God.\\" throughout this series. Its absolutely priceless. I downloaded this on bittorrent (720p), but I'm still buying the DVDs so my friends and family can watch it without a computer. Its worth every penny.  <br /> <br />I also recommend Life of Mammals, Life in the Undergrowth, Blue Planet, Life of Birds, and Life in the Freezer. All from the BBC.
1400034205|4.0|After a short term of adjustment to the prose form and dated situation, the plot and characters were compelling.  As the story unfolded I continually reflected on how my behavior would have either mirrored or differed from those being portrayed.  Absorbing.
0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's superb Eat, Pray, Love is a three-continent travelogue, biography and spiritual journey that combines despair, comedy and wisdom to excellent effect.  Gilbert catalogues her journey from the depths of a troubled U.S. divorce through an initial, food-fueled recovery in Italy, to a lengthy meditation retreat in India, to additional spiritual discoveries and romantic renewal in Indonesia.  Elizabeth Gilbert's travels are both comic and insightful and she is never less than intelligent, funny, sympathetic and witty.<br /><br />Gilbert's prose is vivid and elegant, and her recounting of her descent to the depths of unhappiness and her gradual emergence will bring comfort to the many who have experienced similar cycles.  Gilbert's setbacks and triumphs in entering a demanding meditation program will also be recognized, chuckled over and appreciated by those who have grappled with meditation or similar disciplines.<br /><br />For most of us, life is a series of valleys and peaks.  In Eat, Read, Pray, Elizabeth Gilbert brings us to the depths and to the heights.  A most worthwhile and beautifully written book.

B000002JSP|3.0|A tough crowd, from all corners, has dogged \\"In Through the Out Door\\" for years and years, and I guess an album -- a document -- is ripe for the pickings through the eternities. The funny thing about all this \\"swan song\\" stuff is that Robert Plant, to just draw one of them out of a hat, was all of 31 when this record dropped. Led Zeppelin played just about the best dinosaur rock ever made and then were made dinosaurs by the young, loud and snotty. Those folks too have come and gone -- Shane McGowan of the Pogues, is what? 49? last I read. Anyone who has seen the Holy Grail that is the Led Zeppelin DVD set released in 2003, knows it's futile to beef with hell's gods; they simply lord over the land no matter what the puny humans are up to in any given year. Compared to that stuff, which could easily be wrapped in gold and prayed over by the heathen rock worshippers that still lurk about in this fractured, screwed-up end-of-days world we live in, In Through the Out Door is thin gruel, indeed. But judged on its own terms, some very nice things are delivered. \\"All of My Love\\" was probably the only real pop hit this band ever had (\\"Stairway to Heaven\\" being a manufacture of fan favorite turning into tightening FM radio playlist staple; and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" being more orgasm than song). That it doesn't sacrifice any dignity for the band is a pretty good point scored. \\"I'm Gonna Crawl,\\" too, seems unjustly underrated in the canon -- an enormous, deep metal blues ballad tour de force by Plant that showed the band's ability to strip bombast (it's only not bombast compared to the rest of their work) while delivering a convincing emotional wallop. \\"In the Evening\\" is a conventional megaton blast that would have done well on \\"Presence\\" and there's also \\"Fool in the Rain,\\" and the rest, well, doesn't do much of anything. So, that's two keepers, two pretty good ones and three that come along for the ride. Hence, three stars.
B000J10ERO|1.0|I watched \\"Superman (is there any Superman in this film ?) Returns\\" with no expectations, and, even so, this film surprised me with a silliest plot ever imagined, and has the worst actor (?) ever cast to perform Superman. It's impossible to imagine someone worst than Brandon Routh. This is, with no doubt, a film to be forgotten, a sad movie, in all aspects. Even the special effects are second class.
B000LC55F2|1.0|I don't know where to begin in my discussion of the preposterous plot of this movie.  The following review contains SPOILERS, so be alert: <br /> <br />Even if the director wants us to suspend reality enough to believe that Jackman's character found a machine that could clone, let's really examine how he used it.  We're supposed to believe that during the magic trick, Jackman cloned himself and that the clone knew exactly what to do when he appears on stage in the midst of a magic trick. Also, the clone conveniently appears in the exact spot that the magician wants him to. <br /> <br />Also, I felt that the writer/director/whomever wanted the audience to feel sympathetic for the rival magician (the one with the two fingers--can't remember his name). This is so stupid because the rival magician was really a villian, too. He deceived his wife and child for years for the sake of a magic trick. Some great guy. <br /> <br />Overall, the plot of this movie was ridiculous. If you want to see a much more realistic movie about a magician, see the Illusionist with Ed Norton.
B000002J09|4.0|I'll get right to it and annoy all of the purists by saying that I really dislike \\"Black Dog.\\"  It's frenetic pace and screaming vocals, though characteristic of this particular genre and Zeppelin's sound, are rather obnoxious. <br /> <br />\\"Rock and Roll\\" is solid and well-known, if unfortunately similar in sound and style to \\"Black Dog.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The Battle of Evermore\\" is clever and more melodic than the two screamers that precede it. <br /> <br />Though it is probably overplayed, \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is brilliant.  The shift from its simple beginning to its driving conclusion is quite a ride.  In fact, this song is so fantastic that I'm not sure it can be overplayed. <br /> <br />\\"Misty Mountain Top\\" is solid, with some rather unique vocal harmonies, though it is somewhat repetitive. <br /> <br />\\"Four Sticks\\" has some intricate lyrics, and it includes some more interesting parts in the middle. <br /> <br />\\"Going to California\\" is the second best song on the album.  I think this type of music is the best fit for Robert Plant's vocals.  And the guitar accompaniment is great stuff. <br /> <br />\\"When the Levee Breaks\\" is another very repetitive song, but it's a solid way to end this classic album. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is too short.  Another three or four tracks would have made it feel more worthwhile.  Of course, these ideas are heretical to the Led Zeppelin purists, but that's just the way I see it. <br /> <br />Am I glad that I own this album?  Absolutely.  Do I enjoy listening to it?  Absolutely.  Could it have been better?  I think so.

B000M5AJQS|4.0|I am the kind of viewer who, when looking at films with plot twists and turns and double crossings back and forth, gets very very confused.  This movie is obviously great ... I've looked at it 3 times already and I still don't get it.  But I can tell it's quality.  Too bad I can't come back and rate it again after the 7th viewing.  If you enjoy plot twists and the kind of movie you have to pay close attention to, this is it.  It definitely has a lot of action.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This edition of Love Actually is more than I expected. I had the chance to watch the movie on theater when it was released but is one of those you've got to keep on your DVD collection
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I have to say one thing at the start of this review. I'm gonna air some dirty laundry that I have concering what I've learned thanks to this film. The film itself is amazing. Beautfully shot and edited by Davis Guggenheim that finds the balance between the lecture and Gore's journey. <br /> <br />One of the criticisms leveled at this film was why Gore seemed so passionate here and on the 2000 Election he seemed bland and the Frankenstein creature as Jonah Goldberg called him in National Review. He makes it clear in the film that what that election did was wake him up in some way. After \\"losing\\" the election he had to asess what he had to do next and, after being a career enviromentalist in the Senate, he knew what he had to do. He learned and studied and went places where the threat of global warming was at it's highest.  <br /> <br />I also feel that he won't run for president in 08. He's spent thirty or so years in government. As he says, \\"The victories that weren't really victories.\\" He's probably burned out by it and he no longer has faith that the government can solve these problems and I, quite frankly, feel the same way. <br /> <br />Watching this, I couldn't help but think about the average person's response to something like gas prices. When they start going up, all you hear from people are when and if the prices our gonna go down. You don't hear people talking about things like mass transit, alterative fuels, etc. Granted, it's not the immediate concern but what I'm saying is you NEVER here it. You hear it now because of films like this, because of Hurricane Katrina, the introduction of the Hybrid vehicles. What does that mean? It means that like the doc \\"The Corporation\\" said, that corporate (and even govermental) social responsiblity is a PR scheme, it's a marketing decision, and they can go back on them if they see their profits drop. It also makes our responisbility as consumers clear, we have to make it clear, by what we buy and do, that they can't goback to their old ways. <br /> <br />But concluding this rant, and I'm sorry for that, I have a darker view of humanity after seeing this film. I have become an pessimistic optopmist. I want something like the sea levels rising 20 feet, or another ice age hitting Europe, or sea level acidity rising so it can't support various kinds of life. I want something like that to happen because, as Gore points out, our nervous system is like the frog in the lukewarm water being slowly brought to a boil, cause that's what it's gonna take. But I can't bring myself to belive that we would let that happen. <br /> <br />Why don't we really care?
B00006L7XQ|5.0|My 22 yr old son came to me and said  he would like to have this CD,Of course me being mom did a double look at him.Then he explained to me why.He was impressed that This CD contained a song from a man generations apart from him that one of the bands he listen to does now days,and he was impressed with the version of Jonny Cash,and couldnt find it anywhere.So I found it and bought it for him.Its an awesome  CD and he not only listens to the one song on it ,he listens to the whole CD.
B000MXPE74|4.0|I first heard The Fratellis on MTV when they were playing the video clip for their single \\"Flathead\\".  There sound drew me and made me want to listen to the full length album, COSTELLO MUSIC.<br /><br />\\"Henrietta\\" starts off the album with a bouncy, lively feel.  The guitars are \\"nasty\\" and dirty sounding and The Fratellis let it all hang out on the opening track of COSTELLO MUSIC.  The hook is incredibly catchy and makes you want to keep pushing the repeat the back button to hear \\"Henrietta\\" again and again.  The energy just might be where the true lovability factor for The Fratellis comes from.  They definitely have a distinctive sound, not unlike the pheonomenal Arctic Monkeys in that regard.  \\"Flathead\\", the single that is recieving airplay over here in the U.S. is exceptional.  The lyrics are genuinely top-notch, the music is energetic and in the case of \\"Flathead\\" itself, it is unpredictable.  The switch of meters during the chorus is genius, something that only the most adventurous of bands are willing to dare to even put off. Again, it is unique compared to what U.S. bands are doing.  \\"Flathead\\" doesn't even resemble the same park as Daughtry's \\"It's Not Over\\" or FOB's \\"Ths Ain't A Scene, It's An Arms Race\\";  it's a whole different style, whole different sound, and a whole different league.<br /><br />\\"Whistle for the Choir\\" slows and quiets things down a little.  The chord progression is very nice and the lyrics shine over the subtle acoustic guitar work from the onset.  the track picks up, and while it is more dynamic than the intro, it isn't nearly as bombastic or testerone-filled as \\"Henrietta\\" or \\"Flathead\\".  The change is much appreciated, and \\"Whistle for the Choir\\" proves to be as strong as either \\"Henrietta\\" or \\"Flathead\\".  \\"Chelsea's Dagger\\" resurrects the testosterone filled sound that the group achieved on the first tracks, which is a welcome return and well planned.  The lead vocalist as always sounds strong and his voice ascends to the top of the production very well, a problem often encountered when the guitars are overproduced (everything blends well here!).  \\"The Gutterati?\\" speeds the tempo up even more and the vocals grow quite indecipherable.  But like the punk music in America that grows to extreme tempos, it is the \\"effect\\" of the song that matters more at that point as opposed to the lyrics.  The harmonica solo is definitely unique; show me a harmonica solo in an American rock band that isn't classified as southern or blues-rock...exactly.  \\"The Gutterati\\" is definitely LOUD.<br /><br />\\"For The Girl\\" doesn't slacken on energy a bit. The hook is definitely killer, which is a strong point of The Fratellis, as all of their songs show. \\"Doginabag\\" slows thigs down, aiming for a bluesier number.  The guitars sound straight out of the 1960s, most certainly the sound that The Fratellis are trying to achieve. \\"Creepin' Up The Back Stairs\\" features infectious claps to begin the song and breaks into full-fledge indie-rock infection.  Again, not unlike \\"The Gutterati\\", the words sometimes mush together, giving off a mix between the fast-swing jazz performance, rap, and punk.  It doesn't quite achieve the same plane as the best, but it is (as the whole album is), above average.<br /><br />\\"Vince The Loveable Stoner\\" certainly wins prize for one of the most uniquely named tracks.  Again, the Fratellis slow things down to a more moderate tempo after the \\"blazing\\" \\"Creepin' Up The Back Stairs\\".  Not the best of the best, but again, wouldn't you be drawn to listen to a song about a \\"loveable stoner\\"?  I would. \\"Everyone Knows You Cried Last Night\\" is another track worth a listen merely by its title. The blunt nature of the Fratellis just maybe another one of their draws and maybe why the could possibly become the U.S. new imported indie darlings. \\"Everyone Knows You Cried Last Night\\" turns out to have a blues quality reminiscent of the 1960s.  The lyrics continue to be potent here, quite like their contemporaries, The Arctic Monkeys. The \\"spunky\\" nature of the group adds to the package.<br /><br />\\"Baby Fratelli\\" proves to be the \\"big number\\" with an anthemic chorus that would make any classic rock & roll star or listener proud. The changes of style utilized here are great as well and the guitar riff during the verse is genius. \\"Baby Fratelli\\" turns out to be one of the best of the album, up there with \\"Henrietta\\", \\"Flathead\\", \\"Whistle\\", among others. \\"Got Ma Nuts From A Hippy\\" is certainly pretty blunt, again a draw to the Fratellis.  Despite being good, the track is a bit of let down, though not by much. an \\"Untitled\\" track ends the very distinguished album.<br /><br />Overall, The Fratellis have it going on.  Occasionally, the band teeters on the cusps of total absurdity with their dynamics (rock can really be never too loud), but otherwise, the material is first rate. 4 stars.contemporaries, The Arctic Monkeys.

B00004TH7Z|3.0|In 1999, it was announced that vocalist Bruce Dickinson & guitarist Adrian Smith were returning to Iron Maiden after being gone for six & ten years, respectively.  The metal community rejoiced, because the albums that Maiden put out following Smith's departure in 1989 (NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING & FEAR OF THE DARK) were not very good, & the ones they released after Dickinson's left in 1993 (X FACTOR & VIRTUAL XI) were just plain awful.  They would retain Adrian Smith's replacement, Janick Gers, which made Maiden a three-guitar band (Dave Murray being the third guitarist).  Bruce Dickinson's repalcement, Blaze Bayley, left the band.  Maiden would have a new album out in 2000, entitled BRAVE NEW WORLD.  There was a great deal of anticipation surrounding it.  K-ROCK in New York even played the first single from the album, \\"The Wicker Man\\" (yes, believe it or not, you could hear rock music on the radio in New York in 2000).  Anyway, the song sounded great & I was stoked to get the new album.  I guess I was hoping for an album that was as strong as their self-titled debut or THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST.  Let's just say that I was in for a bit of a disappointment when I finally heard BRAVE NEW WORLD. <br /> <br />The album starts off strongly with the aforementioned \\"The Wicker Man\\" & \\"Ghost Of The Navigator.\\"  These songs have great guitar riffs & they flow nicely.  The album goes downhill from here though.  During the years that Blaze Bayley was their singer, Maiden got into the very bad habit of repeating chorus sections in some of their songs over & over & over again.  Unfortunately, the band failed to break that habit here.  The album's title track is a prime example of this.  Another is \\"The Mercenary,\\" which is a shame because the song has a great verse riff.  Listening to Dickinson sing \\"Show them no fear, show them no fear\\" repeatedly just gets tiring. <br /> <br />\\"Blood Brother\\" is a ballad-like song that just doesn't work.  There are two prog-ish sounding tracks here, \\"Dream Of Mirrors\\" & \\"The Nomad.\\"  \\"Dream Of Mirrors\\" is not very good & has an absolutely jarring intro.  \\"The Nomad\\" is much better & is one of my favorite songs on the album.  Another track that I like is \\"The Fallen Angel,\\" which is a straight-forward riff-rocker.  \\"Out Of The Silent Planet\\" is an okay song but nothing great.  I guess you say the chorus is kind of catchy.  Bruce Dickinson's vocal line in \\"The Thin Line Between Love & Hate\\" just sounds awkward.  Definitely a song to skip over. <br /> <br />Kevin Shirley produced BRAVE NEW WORLD, & he did a fine job.  The guitars come through crisply & clearly as does Steve Harris' bass guitar.  Murray, Smith & Gers find room to take solos.  Bruce Dickinson's voice sounds very strong.  If you've read my reviews of some other Iron Maiden albums, you've probably noticed that I'm not a big fan of drummer Nicko McBrain.  While I still believe that Maiden was a better band with Clive Burr on drums, McBrain does a good job on BRAVE NEW WORLD.  Unfortunately, Iron Maiden didn't come up with enough good material to match the high production values.
0316666343|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously.  It is well written with a twist.  It is not normally what I would read but I enjoyed it and I recommend it to others.
B000063DFN|5.0|What can I say? It's a great CD. It arrived in perfect condition. The CD itself is a masterpiece. Iron Maiden is the best band of their kind in existance today. They rule all that is metal. This CD is highly recommended.
B00005JPLU|4.0|\\"300\\", the new film based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller (\\"Sin City\\"), is easily one of the most interesting and visual films I have ever seen. Lots of time and effort went into creating a unique and stylized look for the film. Generally, when this happens, the director and production team have little energy, time left for things like story and character development. But writer - director Zack Snyder (\\"Dawn of the Dead (2004)\\") has also adapted an interesting and involving story from the celebrated graphic novelist's work.<br /><br />King Leonidas (Gerard Butler, \\"Andrew Lloyd Weber's The Phantom of the Opera\\", \\"Dear Frankie\\"), fearless leader of the Spartans, receives a messenger from King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro, \\"Love, Actually\\", TV's \\"Lost\\"), the king of Persia and ruler of all Asia. \\"Surrender to him and you can keep your kingdom\\". Leonidas doesn't know the meaning of the word \\"surrender\\" and, against the wishes of the elders, amasses an army of 300 of his fiercest warriors to do battle with Xerxes' army of tens of thousands. Sounds like a fair match to Leonidas. They know of a small valley leading through two mountain passes and intend to use this as a bottleneck for the enemy, picking them off slowly and surely.  His Queen, Gorgo (Lena Headey, \\"The Brothers' Grimm\\", \\"Ripley's Game\\"), stays behind and tries to convince the council to send a full army, to back up her husband. Dilios (David Wenham, \\"The Proposition\\", \\"Lord of the Rings\\"), a warrior who also serves as an oral historiographer, narrates the story and helps to ensure the legend will live on.<br /><br />Written and directed by Snyder and based on Miller's story, \\"300\\" has one of the most interesting, and consistent visual looks I have ever seen in a film. The filmmakers have gone to great pains to recreate the look of Miller's art; most, if not all, of the film was shot in front of a blue screen with the backgrounds and physical locations added later, allowing them to give the film an artistic look. Throughout the film, this adds a touch of drama to the look and feel of the story. Leonidas marches up stairs to a temple on a mountaintop, the full moon sitting directly behind it (a truly beautiful image) and this would never have been possible with sets and other forms of traditional filmmaking. In a prologue, we learn how Leonidas fought a wolf. The wolf, a creation of CGI, is, nonetheless, very fearsome. As the two creatures circle one another, snow falls on the barren mountain, providing one of the most `graphic novel-like' images in the film. As the 300 warriors move off to do battle, they walk through a field of grain waving in the wind. As they battle, we see brief snippets of their confrontations with various creatures, all of which is depicted in a way that can be rightfully described as beautiful. As much as a film with so much violence, blood and gore can be, \\"300\\" is a beautiful film to watch.<br /><br />This technique of shooting the film almost entirely in front of a blue screen has been used before (\\"Sin City\\", also based on a Frank Miller graphic novel) and seems to lend itself well to this style of filmmaking. The difference between the two films is \\"300\\" does not have comic book panels and tries to depict the legend of the Battle of Thermopylae in a way befitting a legend. Don't get me wrong. I loved \\"Sin City\\"; it is one of my favorite films, \\"300\\" is also very good, but \\"300\\" is shot in a way that reminds me of an artist painting on a canvas. The backgrounds and the settings are all created by computers and through special effects and the filmmakers have gone to great lengths to make them appear both painterly and different. Because this story is basically based on a legend, this style fits. Everything appears realistic, but also exaggerated, much like a myth or legend would be; it contains some elements of truth, but over the years, many parts of the story have been enhanced.<br /><br />Most films filled with special effects are missing some important key elements; a story, character development and people and things to care about. I am happy to say that \\"300\\" has these elements. I went to see the film with a friend of mine and the first thing he said as we left the theater was \\"That had a really good story\\", as though he was surprised. And he had every right to be. Most big budget films filled with special effects have at least one weak element, the story.  \\"300\\" follows the legend of King Leonidas and the events leading to the Battle of Thermopylae. Did this story actually happen? Maybe, but it has become more of a legend or myth at this point and the story is grand enough to fit the subject matter. The film begins with Delios recounting the birth and childhood of the boy who would become King Leonidas. In Sparta, boys grow up fighting, to become fierce warriors, and Leonidas is no exception. We watch a couple of key moments and then we meet the adult King and his wife and their son. These elements are all key because as soon as Xerxes' messenger arrives and tells Leonidas of the Persian King's ultimatum, we know Leonidas will never give in. And Leonidas dispatches the messenger in a pretty spectacular way. Then the story shifts and Leonidas has to try and amass an army against the wishes of his advisory council. But there are many key elements in this section which give the film depth and interest.<br /><br />The battle is interesting because they face a variety of foes, almost as though Xerxes sends in one team after the next, to see who will win, not really expecting he will have to have an all out battle. As each of these groups battles, the action is filmed in a unique way. We might see a character swing his huge blade at an attacker, the action will slow down considerably and then speed up slightly after impact. This technique is not new either, having been used in many, many martial arts films, but in \\"300\\", it adds an almost ballet-like look and feel to the battles, further adding to the beauty of the overall film. These scenes are pretty bloody, sometimes gory and very violent, so it seems odd to be calling them beautiful, but they are just that.<br /><br />The acting is full of shouts, grand gestures and broad movements, strangely fitting for a myth or tall tale. Gerard Butler almost always shouts, growls or grimaces, with every line, giving him the air of a man with a lot on his mind. He clearly loves his wife and son, but has the fate of his people in his hands. He must go to battle, even if it means 300 against tens of thousands. Dominic West plays Leonida's advisor and friend, Theron, a member of the council. He is more subtle, but also a man of State, so he does not have to go to battle and must stay behind to attend to politics. Lena Heady is very good as Queen Gorgo. She is a strong female character and that fact does not go unnoticed in this society; the messenger questions it, Theron uses it and Leonidas is attracted to it. David Wenham's Delios provides narration in the beginning and end and at periodic moments throughout. His voice struck me as slightly odd, as though he was trying to mimic Butler's fearsome growls, but didn't have the right type of voice. He often reminded me of a high school actor, someone narrating \\"Our Town\\", standing at the corner of the stage, trying to `emote' to the edges of the audience. I didn't expect Delios to partake in the battle, but he puts on his leather bikini and straps a piece of fabric over one shoulder just like all of the other soldiers in Leonida's army. Perhaps showing off their chiseled abs, and they are universally chiseled (perhaps a little touch up with CGI?) was a method of intimidation. Xerxes is played by Rodrigo Santoro, who suddenly appeared on the island in \\"Lost\\" and is perhaps best known as Laura Linney's object of lust in \\"Love, Actually\\". In \\"300\\", he is bald, very buff and covered with piercings and chains.<br /><br />The friend who accompanied me initially sent me an e-mail askingto join me when I went to see the film, stating \\"300 scantily clad Spartans? I'm there.\\" I wonder if he realized going in they were all men. Because he's straight. Actually, there are a few moments when the bare flesh extends to women, but the main display of flesh is male.<br /><br />\\"300\\" is a rousing film, filled with beautiful imagery and an involving story.to the beauty of the overall film.

B00003CXTG|2.0|I was real disappointed in this movie, especially after looking forward to a modern day portrayal of the attack at Pearl Harbor.  Yes, there were some good special effects and big explosions (the only thing keeping this from one star), but overall this missed the mark.  Why? Mainly because of the hokey love story that was the main premise of the movie.  People go to a movie title \\"Pearl Harbor\\" to see what happened at Pearl Harbor, not to follow some corny love triangle superimposed on the attack. Basically, this is a chick-flick disguised as a war movie, and it doesn't work.<br /><br />If you want to see about Pearl Harbor, rent \\"Tora Tora Tora\\".  If you want a love story, rent \\"Titanic\\".  Stay away from this one.  It's not worth the time.

0743289684|5.0|I give this book 5 stars for the following reasons:<br /><br />1)It is a moving account of young female intellectual awakening, which is a point of view we rarely see and desparately need, especially in the United States where the word \\"Feminism\\" has been twisted to simply mean \\"man-hater\\" which is a ridiculously incorrect and shallow definition.<br /><br />2)It is a clearly written account of an extremely complicated story with myriad people, places, values and events that most Americans know nothing about and can barely understand. We need this clear presentation. This is certainly my first encounter with many of these ideas, belief systems and cultures, and I appreciate the direct cadence.<br /><br />3)The importance of literacy, reading, languages and thoughtful questioning are spoken of authentically and throughout the narrative, making it a vital book for all educators to look at and use, especially those of us working with the vast number of illiterate and sub-literate American children and teens alive in this nation--children and teens woefully ignorant of the power of knowledge and full of disdain for education in general.<br /><br />4)Another refreshing facet of the book is the back and forth emotional struggle of a person trying to determine what she believes for herself in terms of religion and politics. Again, this is a topic that Americans need to start thinking about. It is important for citizens in a Democracy to figure out what they believe and why they believe in it as they grow into young adulthood and beyond. The examined life is crucial to the health of democracy.<br /><br />5)The irony of this latest twist in her life (being asked to leave the \\"enlightened\\" country she was trying to embrace) is an important reality for all Western activists to examine--the political landscape across the world is in such great upheaval and it is time for ALL of us to examine all levels of alliances and political definitions. The world is changing rapidly, and we need to move quickly to help shape this world in a positive and meaningful direction and be open to all kinds of ideas that are brand new!

B000MVQ9P2|3.0|South Korea's highest grossing film of all time \\"The Host\\", a new monster film, takes this genre to levels unknown previously with films like \\"Godzilla\\" and \\"The Blob\\". It represents a significant advancement in the technology and a lesser advancement in narrative.<br /><br />Seoul, 2000. An American army doctor (Scott Wilson) orders his assistant, a native South Korean, to dump bottles and bottles of formaldehyde into the drain, a drain running into the Han River, the major river running through the middle of Seoul. The reason? The bottles are covered with a layer of dust and the army doctor really dislikes dust. The assistant protests, but soon relents. Six years later, a food cart operator, Gang-Du (Kang-ho Song) falls asleep every time his dad, Hie-bong (Hie-Bong Byeon) is away from the stand for more than a few minutes. Soon, his daughter, Hyun-Seo (Ah-sung Ko) returns from school and they watch his sister compete in an archery tournament on television. Father and daughter are more like friends; Gang-du even seems to be a bit mentally challenged, like he is at the same level of maturity as his daughter. Then a monster appears in the river and starts to attack the people lounging by the side of the river. Gang-du and Hyun-Seo are chased by the beast and Dad tries valiantly to save his daughter, but the beast soon captures her and drags her away. Nam-Joo (Du-na Bae), the sister, returns from the tournament and they are joined by their brother, Nam-il (Hae-il Park), a young businessman annoyed at the distraction. They receive a call from the daughter's cell phone and try to rescue her, fighting the local authorities, the police, the US Army (?) and ultimately, against the large monster.<br /><br />Directed by Joon-ho Bong, the rights to \\"The Host\\" have already been purchased for an American remake, and it is easy to see why. The film's monster elements are well-done, interesting and exciting. But the film suffers from a few uneven performances and some heavy handed political statements which ultimately slow down the proceedings.<br /><br />From what I understand, the initial event is based on an actual event. The Korean government attempted to prosecute the guilty American, but the US wouldn't hand over the man in question. According to IMDB, he was finally convicted in 2005, but didn't serve a prison term. I always believe that a fantasy, science fiction, horror film, anything that is not normally something we would experience is more believable, has roots in reality. \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" is a great recent example of this; the fantasy world was rooted in the very real world of Spain during the last days of the Civil War. These elements of reality help us associate the more fantastical elements of these stories, making us more willing to accept them. While watching the film, I didn't know that something like this actually happened, but I believed it, because it was convincingly done and seemed like something that could happen.<br /><br />The monster, created by a special effects studio in San Francisco, is a very unusual thing. Part fish, part eel, part guppy and part frog, multiplied by a thousand (the suckers big and looks like a large \\"Alien\\"), the Monster initially appears hanging from underneath a bridge. People notice the thing and, curious, move closer to get a look. Then it drops into the water and swims towards the people. Moments later, attack.<br /><br />The first time the Monster runs rampant is exciting and fun to watch. The beast moves fast and wreaks havoc on a small leisure area, where people are lounging in the sun next to the river. Naturally, Gang-du and his family will be in the center of the action, they are our entry into this world. The monster chases people back and forth, takes a few, but Gang-du tries to elude the beast, tries to keep his daughter safe.<br /><br />The monster is fearsome, and dangerous, making it a little scary. Because it is fast, this adds to the suspense. You never know when or where it will pop up. It also appears to be smart and has a voracious appetite, adding to the scariness of the beast. When it grabs Hyun-Seo, the drama increases because Gang-du naturally fears his daughter is dead, then they receive a cryptic phone message indicating she might still be alive. The family bands together and starts to hunt for her. This leads the individual characters on `hero's journeys' of their own, until they have to come together and work together to fight the beast.<br /><br />As the family comes together, and gets separated, during their battle with the monster, they face various obstacles. Many of these are also presented in a fairly realistic fashion, adding to the heightened level of suspense. Each is tested, some with frightening results.<br /><br />The film is less successful as a political statement against the involvement of the US Government in this country and in this incident. As soon as the animal runs rampant, it attacks a US Citizen who is vacationing. Then the news is filled with stories of a virus the man contracted through the monster. Soon, the US Army has quarantined people, hunting for others who have come into contact with the beast, closing off entire areas and plans to use a chemical called \\"Agent Yellow\\", not a very thinly veiled attempt to make a statement against Agent Orange. This is done in a rather sloppy fashion, and not fully integrated into the rest of the story. This brings the rest of the film down. In the big confrontation between the beast and `Agent Yellow', the Army intends to dispense the chemical using a large yellow plastic ball on the end of a crane, which shoots the chemical in a large plume. Hopefully, their targeting system is much more accurate than the contraption looks, it resembles a large tinker toy. Of course, the chemical doesn't have the intended effect and there are many shots of indigenous South Koreans suffering at the hands of the nasty American chemical.<br /><br />These scenes are really more of a distraction, not necessary and detract from the overall quality of the rest of the film. The monster is a neat, unique creation which is scary, threatening and fun to watch. But when the film gets bogged down with all of the politics, it loses focus.<br /><br />I didn't really get what Kang-ho Song was trying to do as Gang-du. Initially, we see he is lazy and more interested in cutting corners than helping to make a success out of the family's food van, very antithetical to the South Korean way of life. But when his daughter shows up, I initially thought he was an older, less intelligent brother. He seems to want to have this type of relationship with his daughter, but he really seems more mentally challenged than anything else. This is clearly done to make his actions throughout the rest of the film appear all the more heroic, but his portrayal is initially inconsistent.<br /><br />During the last act, when the family has to come together again to defeat the creature, the film shifts again, delivering on the premise of the earlier story.<br /><br />\\"The Host\\" is a good film, which benefits greatly from advanced special effects and suspenseful storytelling, but it suffers from an almost sophomoric attempt to make a political statement, slowing down the pace of the story, and interrupting the flow of horror, suspense and excitement.<br /><br />I wonder if the American remake will have some sort of reference to terrorists trying to take over the water supply of St. Louis and they inadvertently create this beast who roams through the upper Mississippi river.when or where it will pop up.

B000068TPN|5.0|Put aside your opinions of Gibson. This movie isn't about him or his character. Character studies of lunatics driven mad by this insane war is the Vietnam movie we've come to expect. This is something different. In fact Gibson in a helmet looks so much like John Wayne that its easy to mistake this for a WWII movie. But fortunately this isn't an old-fashioned propaganda film. This movie gives heroism and realism a fine balance and both sides of the fight are treated honestly and with respect. <br />Heroism aside, the death toll in this story proves the waste of it all. Nobody has to die in these wars of choice and the cursed names of those who commit troops to die in them will live in infamy. That is their legacy.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|I ordered this item expecting to be happy because I love the show. But when I ordered the item, I found that some of the disks skip and don't play right. I had a replacement ordered and that skiped to. You can imagine my frustration. I had to return this item twice. I finally decided to buy it directly from HBO, I hope that these disks work. My recommendation:Don't buy this item from Amazon!
B0000214F0|3.0|Usually I am not one to type spoilers on films and since I still have not managed to make it thru this entire movie there will be none, but about 100 minutes into the unrated version, I started to squirm...it's not solely the issue of sex and who has sex with what gender, etc...just that how it was presented was hard for me to deal with.  Maybe that I felt that several of the great actors (Peter O'Toole as one of them) convinced me so completeley that this was really taking place that I squirmed.  I think that the sets and actors are truly amazing and plan to finish watching the rest of the movie within the next few days or so.  Not for family viewing at all and the unrated version is quite graphic; not just in the sex scenes, but in the general perversion of Tiberius' sereglio and Caligula's following descent into darkness and depravity.  View with caution.  Not your average porno, by any stretch.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|I chose to see Mike Newell's MONA LISA SMILE for a simple reason : I wanted to spend an evening with my wife and my daughter together and this movie seemed, according to the souvenirs of the reviews I read four years ago, perfect for this occasion. Well, if I didn't like the movie as much as my girls, I appreciated it however for two peculiar reasons. First of all, Mrs. Roberts, Dunst and Stiles are quite excellent in MONA LISA SMILE and they all deliver a superb performance. Then, I was very impressed by the sceneries and the decors created by the production designer. As for the screenplay, it's an average story not worse and not better than the hundreds of storylines vomited by the Hollywood factories every year.<br /><br />A DVD zone suffragettes.
B000065VB0|4.0|With his third solo album, Peter Gabriel redefine music and explore some totally new sounds.  This cd was the first with the typical Gabriel sound. <br />This cd has no other to compare with, PG invented the style and he is still alone in this area. Personnal favorite are \\"Intruder\\" (He should do it live for a live recording one day maybe !) and \\"Family snapshot\\" <br />Just one weak song, \\"In through the wire\\". Overall, I like it a lot.  <br />
B000002UAR|5.0|It's a Beatles CD so that automatically deserves 5 stars. This is however the album I am most amazed by. Great wit, awesome melodies and of course 'Tomorrow Never Knows', a song that predates acts like the Chemical Brothers by some 30 years.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|This album definately follows the sound they created with ACLOTM, same guitar tones and style with lots of bouncy riffs, the poppy snare drum is still there, and the vocals also follow suit.  It seems incubus creats albums in twos- fungus amungus and science, make yourself and morning view, and these last two.  See thats the fun thing about them they're always changing their sound, i think thats a positive who would want to listen to 6 albums of the same thing?  If you liked ACLOTM you will likely like this one.  It took a few listens for it to sink in for me, its not the kind of album youll be singing along to with just one listen.  Its pretty good but science, morning view, and make yourself are still my favorites.  Bottom line is it's worth picking up and checking out, these are very talented musicians!
B000026OHN|5.0|Having listening to more than a dozen recordings of WTC played with piano, <br />I have to say Richter's rendition is one of the few I love best. Technical virtuosity, melodic fluency, contrapuntal precision, and musical depth are perfectly combined here. Even the tempos could not be better handled. The only thing I find not so good about this rendition is that Richter seems to have used too much petal, making the sound blurring at times. Even so, I stronly recommend this recording on grounds of its artistic value and relevation.
B000M341QO|5.0|Highly recommend this movie.  The actors are great, the plot takes many turns that don't reveal themselves until the last miniute.  Lots of graphic violence so for adults only.  Well deserved oscar for director.  I 'm glad I bought it so I can see it more than once.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|After reading some of the reviews here, I must say I will not spend a freakin dime on any DVD that forces you to watch advertisements. If anyone <br />wants to purchase this movie, I recommend buying the out of print blue DVD.
0060763280|5.0|This is a great book for anyone looking to succeed in all aspects of life. Don't read it without a highlighter pen!!  You will also want to pick up an extra copy for your friends so you don't give yours away.  For the friends that won't read, get the book on CD.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|track 1 has such a crazy riff of only three notes, and no real structure a great intro song.  It takes off from there with the next 9 songs full of energy, no complaints at all.  Free me really stands out for me, that guitar riff is very catchy but has sunstance i must have heard that song 100 times and its still good.  The acoustic cd is awesome too but does not have the same consistancy as cd1 BUT its pretty damn relaxing, again no complaints.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I bought this album for what I'd consider a strange reason: Every week, I watch American Idol, and very often someone sings a Stevie Wonder song. It never sounds very good, and the judges always say \\"you'll never compare well with the great Stevie...\\" Knowing some of the major hits, and generally associating him with \\"I Just Called to Say I Love You\\" and \\"Superstition,\\" I decided I must not be getting the full picture. I was thinking of getting a greatest hits comp, but ultimately decided to try a different route: I'd buy two of his masterpieces. I wanted to see the whole picture, rather than just hear the radio hits. So I bought Innvervisions and Songs in the Key of Life. Holy cow did I make the right choice. It took me only one marathon listening session of both albums to hear what I'd been missing all these years.<br /><br />Many critics and reviewers indicate the album has a slow start, taking a few songs to kick into gear. True, the first songs are slower in pace, but I'd hardly consider it a \\"slow start.\\" More like: Stevie eases you into a place that you're going to be (and want to be) for a long time (at two LPs and an EP - this really is an epic). With so many songs, I'll only mention a few for brevity's sake: \\"Sir Duke\\" is about as danceable a song as I've ever heard while still being substantial. \\"Black Man\\" is a history lesson everyone should hear, and examples of important people in American history of many races are mentioned: black, brown, yellow, and white as well. \\"As\\" gets under your skin on first listen and never lets go.<br /><br />If I could stress one thing about this album, it would be this: These songs are ABOUT something. It's not funk music about wanting to get funky. It's not R&B about sex. Sure, sex and dancing are in there. But so are IDEAS, politics, social theory, parental love, fear, hope, and much more. The music, the singing, and the lyrics work absolutely. And they don't sound \\"dated\\" at all. That is no small achievement. Few artists have ever reached this level, and few ever will.<br /><br />So, as a late-comer to the cult of Stevie, I'm happy to say: Better late than never!tists have ever reached this level, and few ever will. <br /> <br />So, as a late-comer to the cult of Stevie, I'm happy to say: Better late than never!
B000000OQY|3.0|Uncomfortably positioned between the amazing Appetite for Destruction and the miserably indulgent Lose Your Illusion project, this is very much a stopgap release. And like most stopgaps, it's a complete middle-of-the-road project. Combining the pseudo-live (read: in the studio with crowd noises dubbed in) EP Live ?!#* Like a Suicide and a collection of new, acoustic songs, this could've made a great four-song EP, rather than a lousy eight-song LP. I like Reckless Life, a fierce rocker that should by all accounts be a classic, arguably the most underrated GN'R song out there. Same for their version of Mama Kin. On the other end of the specturm are Nice Boys and Move to the City - neither really make much of an impact on me.<br /><br />Onto the new stuff. First, the good news - this contains the Top 5 smash Patience, easily one of the group's best songs ever, once again nailing the sensitive-guy routine (which had also previously been done on Sweet Child O' Mine and would happen a third time on November Rain). It's the perfect song - hell, I even like the whistling at the beginning. For whatever reason, I prefer the acoustic You're Crazy to the one released on Appetite - I don't see why it wasn't included on the album in the first place, as it would've added some variety and pounds the living crap out of the full band one.<br /><br />Okay, now we've got Axl's infamous, borderline-sociopathic stuff. What the hell inspired him to write One in a Million? Was he trying to offend every group of people imaginable, or had he just been dancing with Mr. Brownstone on the Night Train (wink wink nudge nudge) while he was writing it? Even when you look past the lyrics, it sounds like a demo, with Axl singing vocals that sound like he was being castrated as he sang or something. Same with Used to Love Her (But I Had to Kill Her). Jeez, Axl, what the #@)*!) did the world do to you? I mean come on, the guy wore a frickin' Charles Manson shirt, for the love of Eric Clapton (or whoever it is you worship). The sad fact is, he probably just wore the damn thing for  the shock value, since it would take somebody even more psychotic than Axl to support that moron. But I digress.<br /><br />Okay, so what's the point of Lies? Uh, to get Patience on an LP, I suppose, and to make Life !?@* Like a Suicide more widely available. Ooh, ooh! I know! And to hold fans over while they worked on those bloated Illusion discs.ou worship).

B00006DEFA|5.0|It was a great movie and we had wanted this for a long time!
B00005JPCF|5.0|I love this movie! I have twin 8-year-old boys and they love this movie! The animation is awesome, the music makes you want to dance and a great story that actually has a moral to it. I didn't see any \\"agenda\\" or \\"man bad, nature good\\" politics. Just a story about a penguin, born different than the others, who sets out to save the world despite being ridiculed for his \\"happy feet\\" :0) There is a strong conservationist theme and parts of the movie were a bit scary/sad so I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 7 or 8.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I was really impressed by the story line presented in Casino Royale.  Special effects should never take away from a very good story line.  In Casino Royale, however, the producers/directors of the film have taken careful steps to ensure that the special effects compliment the story line.  \\"Casino Royale\\" was actually Ian Flemmings first James Bond novel.  The special features of the DVD suggest that the film is a very authentic rendition of the novel.  (I am not sure since I have not yet read the book).<br /><br />There are three highly compelling stunts that far surpass any that I've seen previously in a film.  The three stunts include a fight scene on the top of a building construction site; a scene in an airport in which a terrorist seeks to crash a heavy-duty truck towards a new airplane; and a case scene.<br /><br />This is an incredibly visually interesting film.
0618680004|5.0|I read a lot, 6-7 books a week, so I tend to read a lot of books from the library, and save my money for truly exceptional books.

This book is one of those rare books that I have not only bought for myself, but will be buying for my Mother, my brother, my best friend, my uncle . . . anyone in my life who I love who is afflicted with religion.  And I hope they have the courage to read it and think about what it says.

B000KRN07S|5.0|This album is another solid performance from one of my favorites.  <br />I have listened to it many many times and I like it better as listen to it more. Once again we have the voice and the piano. There are a few new moves she shows us but nothing heart stopping.   <br />At the end of the day I don't think most of us care what she sings frankly, her voice is addicting and is like a drug to us. Oh you say you wish she would sing something different and stretch her talent and grow and yada yada but most of us would listen to her no matter what she sings because you become so addicted to the voice and sound that it doesn't really matter if she is singing an old country song like Cold Cold Heart, an early rockabilly like Love Me (from the Little Willies) a Bob Dylan number or somthing of her own composition. In the end it is just the soothing that we want and that  is what she does. Her music is sometimes interesting, sometimes a little boring but always soothing. Even if she is talking about a broken heart and lost love she is making us feel like with her voice to hang on to we can make it. <br />So I love her and listen to whatever she puts out. I am not enough of a music expert to judge her artistically, I like what I like and if it sounds good to me I say it is good.  Norah..you are as good as it gets.
B000MV9026|5.0|this was a fantastic movie!  for all the people pissed off about \\"agenda\\" - get over yourself!  this is a clever movie for both children and adults.  just enjoy the hilarious movie without getting caught up in your own personal BS.
1582701709|3.0|I purchased the book a couple weeks ago after hearing all the buzz connected to it and the movie's release.  After reading the first dozen or so pages, I realized that I had read this somewhere before.  Two years previous, I had read nearly all of them in greater detail in the book \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" by Napoleon Hill.  What amazes me is that \\"The Secret\\" never references that very book.  Even down to the phrase \\"Thoughts are Things\\" which is the title of chapter one in his book.   <br /> <br />When I read \\"Think and Grow Rich\\", Hill references a secret in the very front of the book.  I says it is mentioned indirectly at least a hundred times throughout the book.  After I had read it once and then skimmed through it again, I had realized what that secret was and it hit me like a lightning bolt.  I didn't articulate it in exactly the same way, but it was in essence the same thing.  I wrote in the back of the book \\"The secret is to decide and know exactly what it is you want and then work and persist and plan until that thing is acheived or produced.\\"  Granted, it doesn't directly acknowledge the law of attraction (which really is the basis of the secret), but it was something that helped me double my income in a year and get out of debt.   <br /> <br />Since that time, I've relaxed on applying those teachings in my life, but if this book accomplished nothing else for me, it renewed my interest in Hill's classic and the ideas behind the law of attraction.  <br /> <br />I do believe that there is a law of attraction, but I certainly wouldn't equate it with the law of gravity or the laws of physics.  I do believe it is powerful, but it is only powerful because of the actions you decide to take.   <br /> <br />I think the good points of \\"The Secret\\" are that it keeps things simple and mostly to the point.  It also has numerous stories and examples to draw on.  It also takes the reader through a linear course of the things that can apply to their life.  Those are some of the good points. <br /> <br />The downfall comes when there is very little acknowledgement of action on the part of the receipient.  If the law of attraction really was as powerful as claimed and it did work in accordance to the way the teachers outline it, then I could quit my job, sit on my couch and continually think good thoughts of money coming to me in the mail.  It is NOT that simple.  The thinking of powerful, attraction-related thoughts is only a part of the equation.  As I mentioned earlier, if a person doesn't take action to make these things happen, then nothing will happen.  This is the downfall of the book. I don't know if it assumes that the reader is already moving in that direction with his or her actions, but it doesn't really instruct the reader to do anything.  In my personal example, I had to look around me and realize that I was going to need to move to a larger city to get a larger income.  I also needed to be better at budgetting my money.  While I am not the poster child for any of the above-referenced works, I can honestly say that Think and Grow Rich really did help me into making those decisions.   <br /> <br />The other downfall of \\"The Secret\\" is its unwillingness (probably in an attempt to be politically correct) to acknowledge God or Diety of any kind.  There are passages from the Bible, but it almost seems as though it believes the law of attraction operates independent of God.  <br /> <br />Anyway, if you really are interested in what it has to say, pick up the book and then follow it with something like \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" or \\"The Power of Positive Thinking.\\"

1582701709|5.0|THE SECRET says nothing new as some detractors have pointed out. But what it DOES do, is make the science of manifesting accessible to more people through brilliant use of multimedia and mass marketing!<br /><br />As The Secret itself points out, the knowledge in its pages has been around since 3000 BC and rewritten about throughout the ages.  I personally have books by Haanel and Wattle dated in the early 1900's that say the same things as the gurus in The Secret. Sadly, most people never hear of about the power of intent, visualization and manifesting.  This book is the right place to start for most people who are not success or self-improvement junkies.  It's a GREAT first book and simple introduction to the success process.<br /><br />The other thing that I like about The Secret is its use of multiple practitioners who speak from different perspectives on the same topic -- manifesting.  You have a spiritual perspective (Joe Vitale), an analytical perspective (John Assaraf) as well as male and female, black and white.  There is someone in the film and in the book who can speak to you personally in whatever approach will help you best understand.<br /><br />I'm an analytical and was big fan of \\"What the Bleep Do We Know\\" which featured some of the same gurus as The Secret.  It explains HOW the brain works and why quantum physics supports what might otherwise be considered \\"woo-woo\\" new age speak to someone like me.<br /><br />I have bought and gifted many copies of the DVD, CDs and the book of THE SECRET. My goal for the gifts is to help people become aware of their greatness and help them take control of their lives.  The Secret is a great mass market place to start.

B0000BWTK3|5.0|Another super classic album from Leif ove, great performance and clarity of notes a great cd to add to your collection
B000MTPANQ|5.0|. . . is the name of my favorite all-time bootleg album. It's Neil acoustic from the last show of this tour.  The intimacy of this album made me want to see him more than any other artist at the time.  There truly was a magical aura to a Neil show then, and though this is still arguably true, it's also hard to argue with the emotion one gets from listening to this music.  Except for Sugar Mountain, the Massey show contains most of the gems from this album,reproduced in crystal clarity.  From the opening chords of On the Way Home to the closing of I am a Child, there is so much substance here that it is unbelievable that it took this long for it to be released.  What a gem! <br />The DVD does show its age, ironically coming across as a bootleg itself.  For me, it detracts a bit from the music, especially when there is so much other high-quality Neil video out there. Nevertheless, it's great for Neil to be releasing all of this live material.  His shows have changed so much throughout the years that there is bound to be many great hours yet to come.  Thank you Neil.
0307346609|5.0|This is much more than a zombie novel, and indeed zombies are not even the antagonists as much as tools.  As Romero's films were, to varying degrees, metaphors on culture and human nature, this book reveals the struggle of individuals and nations to come to terms with an apocolyptic situation.  This could easily have been written about Europeans in the aftermath of either world wars; zombies just add to the atmosphere and imagination of the stories.  If you're looking for pure blood and guts, rent a movie.  If you're looking for a fascinating peek into human resilience, by all means pick this up.
0375831002|5.0|The only spoiler I will give about The Book Thief is that the narrator is Death personified, but that is on the cover of the book jacket.  Although, I didn't realize that myself until I already got the book.  It only spans about 4 years of a young girl named Liesel and her best friend Rudy.  The \\"Thief\\" part of the title refers to their need to steal things, especially food, because of their poverty and the war situation. <br /> <br />The backdrop is Nazi Germany during World War II.  Everyone has read about the Holocaust in history books, and know about it, if but vaguely.  But, to be thrown in the middle of it was eye-opening.  Anti-semitism is pervasive in The Book Thief, and it's a hard subject to confront.  Hitler is a very real presense throughout the book, especially after a Jewish man named Max enters the story. <br /> <br />The plot is extremely entertaining, and fast developing.  In several spots, I actually laughed out loud.  A good example would be the German vocabulary interspersed throughout the text, especially mild profanity. The characters constantly refer to each other as \\"Saumensch\\" and \\"Saukerl\\" (swine-girl and swine-man, respectively), but the terms are always used very lovingly and humorously.  Liesel's foster parents are so well developed that I actually found myself attached to them.  I have to admit: I simply got drawn into this story.   <br /> <br />Also, the author offers up many \\"hooks\\" that keep you tuned in for subsequent chapters.  And while it doesn't unfold in perfect chronologic order, the plot is easy to follow.  Overall, this book is an instant classic, and I encourage everyone to pick up a copy.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I seen this show on public television and wanted to have the show in my collection to watch anytime (and beats donating 75.00 like they wanted in order to get the dvd) it is a great performance. Rainy miread (fiddler) has a new solo cd along with other members.
B00005JP9V|5.0|My girlfriend and I went to see a film at the university theatre last night.<br /><br />If you have not seen Children of Men, please do so.  Besides being terribly poignant, it is a damn fine piece of film.  The acting, the direction, the sound, everything was especially top-notch.  Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n is definitely one of my favorite new filmmakers.  Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Michael Caine are all excellent.  Clive, who my girlfriend drools over and has erotic dreams about, is amazing and I must grudgingly admit that while I've found him to be decent in the past, this movie puts him in a category I reserve only for the best.<br /><br />In this film, most of the world has descended into chaos and war, where almost everywhere is like Baghdad right now.  The violence was so stark and unapologetic, yet non-gratuitous.  It was real, gritty and emotional.  It reminds us of the ugliness of it all.  Death and violence is not sympathetic, it's not pretty, and it's not romantic.  You feel every cry and scream in your heart as if it were your own.  The movie was so emotionally draining, I couldn't think or talk about anything else for hours.  You walk out shell-shocked, as if you really just spent a few days in a war zone, literally dodging bullets.  Many theatre goers were gasping and grasping on the edge of their seats.  Again, literally.<br /><br />My girlfriend went to the restroom after the movie let out and I sat down at a table and I picked up a news paper and read this item by Thomas L. Friedman:<br /><br />  On February 20th, the AP reported from Afghanistan that a suicide attacker disguised as a health worker blew himself up near \\"a crowd of about 150 people who had gathered for a ribbon cutting ceremony to open an emergency ward at the main government hospital in Khost.\\"  A few days later, at a Baghdad college, a female Sunni suicide bomber blew herself up amid students who were ready to sit for an exam, killing 40 people.<br /><br />  Stop and think for a moment how sick this is.  Then stop for another moment and listen to the silence.  The Bush team is mute.  It says nothing, because it has no moral authority.  No one would listen.  Mr. Bush is losing a P.R. war to people who blow up emergency wards [and children.]<br /><br />It goes of from there, but it got my outrage boiling over, with full realizations about the problems we have and the seeming impossibility of ever clearing them up.  However the movie leaves us with a glimmer of hope, a glimmer so far away you're not quite sure you're seeing anything, possibly just a hallucination, an illusion, a pipe dream from having been alone in the dark for too long.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|Only thing I knew about John Mayer was he was dating Jessica Simpson until I saw him on the Grammy's and just loved his \\"sound\\".  Each song is awesome (well, except no. 9!- too loud) and I play it constantly now.  His voice, his guitar - sorry, I just find him addictive!
B000067J24|5.0|This is an enchanting modern fairy-tale love story that is sweet and funny at the same time.  My favorite bits in it are that true love can conquer all, even the wrath of a goddess... and the people you love are worth far more than a few moments of being in control.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|Silent Force, by Within Temptation, is a very strong CD. It displays a delightful mix of rock and symphony. The vocals are very strong and beautiful.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|First time I heard Corinee Bailey Rae was her performance at the Grammy's and I was blown away by her voice.  I just love the CD - very smooth, relaxing - now it replaces Norah Jones as my favorite de-stressing CD.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I was looking for a DVD of RHCP in concert and took a chance with this one.  Fantastic choice!  The sound is great, the music wonderful, and the cinematology fantastic!  This is a must have for any fan, fanatic,or the curious.  I wish there were more DVD's of this quality out there of RHCP!
B000KQGP2G|3.0|First play was rough, I never found that song that is an instant classic.  I always listen the first time with the booklet so I immediatly noticed the lyrics being very redundant.  When a band as talented as PoS decides to sing about something as petty as MTV's Cribs I feel they are wasting their time, this after pondering the inner mind of God on the last album 'Be'.  Lyrics aside for a minute, the music was very similar throughout.  For the first time as i listened to a PoS album i felt they fit a genre.  There was no beautiful 'pluvius aestivus', no stirring 'Beyond the Pale', and NO sign of 'Dryad of the Woods'.  The only song that struck me as obviously different was Disco Queen, which I love dispite the gratuitous lyrics which make it utterly unplayable in public.  To all the Americans out there looking to buy this album, be prepared for a serious guilt trip.  Again, i feel like the people who will actually listen/buy this album ARE NOT the people who support the war and love what we are doing to the rest of the world.  Songs such as America, Cribcage, and Spitfall are all extremely whiney songs with a proliferation of the 'F word' which isn't necessary.  Only Cribcage has any prescriptive lyrics.   <br />   So, to buy or not to buy that is the question...if you are like me, you have to buy it.  I've been a fan for far to long to not jump all over a new release.  If your new to the scene and liked Be, be prepared for disappointment.  If you like PoS's harder sounding songs such as Rope Ends, Ending Theme, and Used go for it, maybe you'll find something enjoyable.  As for me, this will find its way to the back of the CD player pretty fast, as i await PoS to start singing about the very things they berrate rappers for singing about. (broken childhoods and broken homes)
0800177363|5.0|This 1990 movie is one of my all time favorite movies.<br /><br />It is the moving and true story of a boy named Leonard, who in the year 1918 came down with a strange sleeping disease which leaves it's victims catatonic forever.<br /><br />We then flash to the mid 1960's to a mental hospital, where Robin Williams is hired in as a nice young and ambitious doctor, who takes interest in about 20 patients (of the same disease which Leonard has) who the stafff of the hospital gave up on long ago.<br /><br />Leonard is now a man (Robert DeNiro) and his faithful and loving mother is still alive, and visits him faithfully after all these years (although he is not aware of her presence)<br /><br />Williams discovers a drug called ElDopa which he experiments on these statuesque patients with, and this is where the miracle happens!<br /><br />All these people wake up from thier 40 year sleep, and it is also where the story really begins.<br /><br />All these men and women have first to come to grips with the fact that not only have they been asleep most of thier lives, but they now live in a world they don't know or understand (The 60's).<br /><br />Loved ones have moved on without them, some of them have children who are dead, or husbands who divorced them while in the coma.<br /><br />I won't give away the ending of course, but it is dramatic, and very sad.<br /><br />It is a must see movie, and if you have already seen it, It has probably been awhile, so revisit it. I did, and it was just as wonderful as it was the first time.<br /><br />Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro are genius in thier acting.I still think it is both actors best acting to this day.
B000059GEH|5.0|How could the go wrong...well it is dated...LOL...but still...MM does her best acting and the subtle little digs at other movies of theirs and a certain \\"tough guy\\" along with three of Hollywoods best and most beautiful actresses in one funny and predictable movie...one everyone should add to their collection.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Muse is a phenominal band who seem to have matured with each album. Saying that, this in my opinion, is there greatest album yet. \\"Assassin\\" is one of my favorite songs. Its the \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" of the album, with a harder punch. Their hit single \\"Starlight\\" is also an amazing track. The whole album is very solid, and I would recommend it to any Muse fan out there.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Now, I love \\"Harvest\\", I do. However, the tracks with the London Symphony Orchestra always seemed a bit overblown. Not on this release, nice and sparse here, with Young inserting verses from \\"Heart of Gold\\" during \\"A Man Needs A Maid\\" to create a wonderful medley. While \\"Old Man\\" was always a favorite on \\"Harvest\\" thanks to James Taylor's guitjo picking and harmony vocals, it's just as good here. And \\"Bad Fog of Loneliness\\", that's probably the best song here. Its non-inclusion on \\"Harvest\\", or any other album until this one, is inexplicable.  <br /> <br />David Briggs has got to be smiling up in Heaven and thanking Neil Young for finally coming to his senses and putting this out. It was supposed to be Neil's fourth solo album, not his forty-second. But it's a moot point now, it's out, it's great, go buy it. <br /> <br />May Archival Young recordings keep on coming! I'm not sure if they'll be better, but they've got to be as good. Up next, how about something from the \\"Time Fades Away\\" tour, if possible?
0393327655|3.0|I enjoyed this book and I sympathize with concern about the rise of fundamentalism. My concern with the book is the superficial treatment of ethics and the lack of critical awareness on the part of the author of the short comings of his ethical reasoning. The hidden thesis of his book is really a call to arms for those who are willing to disapprove of religion and specifically faith.  He really gets down to it when he starts to define his ethics in the later chapters and tries to argue that if we can accept collateral damage from typical war scenarios we should be willing to accept torture, as it produces some sort of good. It is simply an argument for the ends justifying the means.He argues that there is really only some sort of neurological inhibition to witnessing torture and that is it is ethically equivalent to any sort of injury to the innocent during war.  He even tries to argue that Pacifism is immoral. Interestingly at this point in the book he wants you to try to overcome your intuition against torture and later in the book the strongest argument he can put forth for you to accept his ethics (he almost admits to the inadequacy of his reasoning) is intuition you might have about ethical acts. <br />It is not amazing that some author is able to write such a naive and sometimes self-contradicting treatise  on ethics what is amazing to me is that it received such uncritical praise and popularity.  Obviously it reflects certain feelings and thoughts popular in the world today, however, I wish there was some intelligent criticisms written about the book other than from those who were obviously attacked (i.e Muslim and Christian fundamentalist as well as liberal believers).  Does science lead us to a society where the end justifies the means and torture is a tool for those who think they deserve to live (for some reason) to use against those they oppose? I am not advocating against the entire book but I think we should step more slowly into his brave new world before we leave the ideas of other ethical thinkers behind, whether that be Gandhi or St.Augustine.  <br />Yes we need to be wary of those who advocate truth based on faith that contradicts science but should we also not be wary of those who advocate ethics based on intuition when at that same time they deny our intuition about some of the most heinous acts of human against human like torture.

B000LC55F2|4.0|I think that the reason I found The Prestige so entertaining is the fact that 1)It had a good cast of actors. 2) It was directed by Christopher Nolan  and 3) It was just a good chance to go into a movie and fall into the story.  There are moments when the storyline is so seemless and dark and intriguing that I was instantly reminded of Nolan's Batman Begins.  The Prestige is a thriller.  It is sort of a mystery. And it's dark.  Nolan prowls the streets of darkness with authority.  Moving performances by Jackman and Bale.<br /><br />Two aspiring magicians are at odds to ruin each others lives both professionally and privately.  After the death of his wife in a botched water-chamber trick, Robert Angier makes it his mission to defame and destroy the man he holds responsible for his wife's untimely demise,  Alfred Borden!  Angier  is a master showman, full of charisma, spell-binding audiences with his charm.  Borden is a masterful illusionist, bringing the impossible alive on stage.  Each is seeking to become the greatest magician of all time, cullng their bitterness into obsession, seeking the secrets to each other's illusions.<br /><br />In a time when such great cinematic distractions like Pan's Labrynth and Apocalypto were taking my attention, The Prestige was a good contender for my time. Christopher Nolan does not disappoint.  Michael Caine.  Scarlett Johnsson.  David Bowie.  Great supporting cast.  The ending isn't as mind-blowing as I expected, but it was defintely cool.  Pure story, the way I like my movies.  Not a lot of things to pick on.  Jackman and Bale have emerged a fine actors.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Dig it!
B00028HBKC|5.0|The last riveting hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth starting from his prayer in the Garden to his arrest, trial, cruxifiction, death, and resurrection. A stunning, intense, vibrant, and the most true to life depiction of the the centrepiece of Christianity - the cross - and its vast impressions on theology. Mel Gibson, a very conservative Catholic, captures the Jewish origins of the founder of Christianity ... complete with cinematic images of the desert. Whether you believe in the religious story of this film or not the message of sacrifice and a passionate ectasy for God's will is, at the very least, awe inspiring.
B000083C49|3.0|As time moved on for the aging crew of the Starship Enterprise and its fanbase was also growing older and more(dare I say it!) sophisticated  (on a purely geeky scale, of course) the producers decided it was time to start turning away from the sheer-fan aspect of the gene-pool and try and find other targets in the demographical arena that was middle class America.  Namely, the kiddies.  Now, what kid wanted to watch a bunch of old geezers up on the silver screen acting all sci-fi and cool?  Not many.  I was 16 when Star Trek IV came out and I gotta tell ya, another Star Trek movie wasn't high on my list of priorities unless the ticket for the theatre was hidden in the bra of a 16 year old girl.  So the old dudes started doing a lot more one-liners than before.  The surly Dr. McCoy as a regular stand-up comedian.  Spock was the naive sraight-man to most of the jokes.  It was funny.  They were making fun of things that we could relate to.<br /><br />Earth is under attack by some weird cylindrical probe which is vaporizing the oceans and blotting out the sun.  All systems have crashed in the wake of the probe's sheer power.  Earth is doomed.  In their exile on Vulcan with the recently resurrected Spock, the outlaw crew of Enterprise decide it's time to head home and face the music for their actions.  They Sabotaged another starship, disobeyed orders, and destroyed The Enterprise.  Court-martial?  Definitely.  On they way back to Earth they get the distress call. Avoid Earth at all costs!  Spock, having listened to the transmssion the probe is sending, deciphers that the message cannot be answered because it is intended for Humpback whales and they are extinct in the 24th century.  Ooops!  Back in time they head!  Earth!  1986!  San Francisco!  The calmities begin there.<br /><br />Of all the Star Trek flicks, this is probably the funniest. Not the most intriguing, certainly not the worst, either  (Search For Spock gets that award or Generations).  I prefer Wrath Of Khan.  But it is fun to watch.  Deadpan humor.  A look back at the mid-80s.  Worth a look every now and again. Nimoy directs.<br /><br />Dig It!fun to watch.  Deadpan humor.  A look back at the mid-80s.  Worth a look every now and again.

1582701709|3.0|Pagans rejoice for the Savior has come in the name off Rhonda Byrne and The Secret! Heed not the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Torah, the Dhammapada, the New Testament, the Koran, for these books are just books. The Secret is true because ... it was on Oprah!<br /><br />Beware things that tickle your ears for they may blind your eyes. Every concept of The Secret is true but there is a twist in the tale. How so you ask? Whenever something is reduced to a generalized and overly materialized plane of existence ... it is by its extreme ... a distortion .. just like religous fundamentalist are so attached to the letter of the law than the true spirit.<br /><br />The Law of Attraction is an ancient Eastern system that will grant you that which you focus on. It is about energy, concentration, and action. Where The Secret gets wonky is that the language and presentation gives an impression for most people ... that they are in control of the Universe. Just because famous and everyday people believe it is true doesn't render it such .... a billion Catholics think the Pope in infallable but we all know he is a human.<br /><br />The Secret also says in a simple context that everything you think about long enough will happen. You get the essence and not the form. Last I checked I can't recall a single case of someone with HIV infection curing themselves with thoughts. But maybe they aren't feeling good enough about it. The laws of metaphysics are sympatico with the laws of science and the book and movie do not make this clear enough. Also ... if you consider yourself a Christian ... don't allow the Agape endorsement to fool you. They are spiritualists who acknowledge Christ ... but are not Christian in their theological constructs.<br /><br />The universe is neutral and this neutrality is born of balance. Hence why cosmic correction often occurs as karma. And for that matter, if the Law of Attraction is sooooo true ... then are the poor people in Iraq the causee of their own suffering in a war zone????? This is a spiritually dangerous blame game.<br /><br />My advice - forget The Secret. Instead go to The Circle by Laura Day and Write it Down/Make it Happen by Henriette Ann Klauser.<br /><br />And surprise ... you are not God ... and if Sylvia Browne is wrong on national TV ... perhaps The Secret is too.<br /><br />And one last suggestion ... famous people in history actually acted upon their thoughts and visions to make it a reality. Thomas Edison himself said success is 99% persperation and 1% inspiration. He also tried 1000 times until he invented the light bulb. Actions, not words, make a man.

B000JLTR8G|4.0|This is truly one of the best Japanese gangster movies ever made.  Robert Mitchum is wonderful.  This proves my feeling that if you wait years and years and years the great movies will eventually come out on dvd.  Now I can retire my VHS version.
6305252521|5.0|Wherefore art though Truman? Truman Burkbank is the main character played by Jim Carrey in this, his most memorable role besides the Mask. Jim won the Golden Globe for Best Actor but was never nominated for an Oscar for this ground breaking role. What a shame because he is Truman and Truman is him. The sign of great acting is when you really, really care about the character.<br /><br />This is a film with many layers. The casual viewer will enjoy it for its oddball humour and quirky characters. At a deeper level there are parallels for how we as human beings live our lives. There is a innate hunger for feeling alive. Joseph Campbell said that we're mistaken when we think we are searching for meaning. Meaning is your head, its intellectual, but feeling is the whole body. And Truman through his escapades is searching for that feeling of being alive. And there is a girl that was removed from the Truman Show in his youth that drives his magnificent obsession. He gets thwarted by the omniscient Christoff, brilliantly played by Ed Harris, the creator of the Truman Show. And this eventually leads to a face-off which is one of the most spiritual moments ever recorded in cinematic history. The ending of this film almost always brings a tear to my eye because I can feel Truman's pain and his hunger for more. More than what's visible, more than what is allowed. And he finally gives himself permission to go into the unknown.
1582403589|2.0|A friend recently loaned me the first few graphic novels in this series, and I have to say, the writing was like a zombie going through the motions, shambling forward in a sequence of uninteresting and predictable steps.  And like a zombie, this lacked the spark of life that I think distinguishes such comics as The Sandman, Fables, Last Man, etc. <br /> <br />Using zombies as a device should have been a no-brainer (pun intended), but to totally rely on this device without bringing more to the table gives one a huge sense of been there, done that.  While not a total disaster, this was definitely flat reading propped up by the occasional grotesque image to keep it in any way interesting.

0679759328|5.0|Anita Brookner offers up a deft and moving work in her lyrical tale of loneliness, love, and human interaction. Edith Hope, a writer of romance novels, has been banished to an isolated hotel in Switzerland for reasons which are at first unclear. The slow unfolding of her story and the reasons behind her banishment kept me mesmerized, as Brookner weaves a delicately intoxicating spell in Edith's interactions with the often bizarre hotel guests, including the wealthy and selfish Mrs. Pusey and her over-shadowed daughter, Jennifer, whose brilliant vibrance at once attract and repels Edith. She also finds herself courted by the equally wealthy, charming, and unscrupulous Mr. Neville, who understands her and yet would use her to his advantage. In long walks, dilatory conversations, and her meetings with and reboundings on these people, Edith is revealed more and more to be a woman of incredible depth and intensity, facing a turning point in her life, and her story, told in Brookner's clear prose and spiced with subtle irony, humor, and tragedy, is like sinking luxuriously into cool water. A quietly vivid, modern masterpiece, and not to be missed.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Great album - and the remaster really is an unbelievable improvement.  You can really hear all that's going on - and there is a lot!. Liner notes are very informative and interesting. <br /> It's true - all the people that criticized Boston for being a corporate rock band were all wrong.  Tom Shultz and company were just trying to make good rock music, and experiment in the studio - like Brian Wilson.  Also - it features the great vocals of the recently departed Brad Delp. <br />R.I.P. BRAD - I hope you and Kurt are jammin' on a great More Than a Feeling/Smells Like Teen Spirit medley.  Thank you for being a voice during my growing up.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This album in my opinion is one of the best albums to emerge out of the 1990's in the rock genre. All of the lyrics are precise and every song is heavy-hitting musically. This is truly Manson's masterpiece album. This is also the first album he made that he was really proud of. He worked over 7 months to record this album with the help of Reznor's producing, most of which wasn't serious work at all (Read his autobiography The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell as I have to see what I mean by that). This is single-handedly Manson's coming out record - which also brought him one of his most commercially successful hits \\"The Beautiful People.\\" This is his vision of how the world made him how he is today (as of 1996, when he was working on it) and the world in general. It is record is broken into 3 Cycles, Cycle I. The Heirophant, Cycle II. The Inauguration Of The Worm, and Cycle III. Disintegrator Rising. The main concept of the album is of the Distingrator's rise to power and the destruction of the world and himself that insues because of his power that has risen. Over all it makes for a great album as no songs are fillers in the long run, so I'll break it down song by song: <br /> <br />Cycle I. The Heirophant <br /> <br />\\"Irresponsible Hate Anthem\\" - Easily one of the best on the record in my view, this is everything a Manson song could and should be. Fantastic lyrical content and heavy hitting riffs add to the pumping live crowd cheer at the start of the song. *On a side note* The booklet to this album states that this song was recorded on February 14th, 1997 - which is completely wrong as the album was released in October of 1996. <br /> <br />\\"The Beautiful People\\" - Easily another one of the album's best songs, but often is strongly popular among non Marilyn Manson fans. This was the album's first single and what broke the band into mainstream success, it's no doubt with the captivating vocals and instantly noticeable opening riffs. <br /> <br />\\"Dried Up, Tied, and Dead To The World\\" - This song has all the overbearing emotion in lyrics that Manson always seems to write. The song overall is excellent and keeps the darkness in the overall main concept. <br /> <br />\\"Tourniquet\\" - This song was also a single. It's popular but not enough as it should be. It's more the lyrics rather that the music in this one. But all in all it is a very good and stand out song from the album. <br /> <br />Cycle II. Inauguration Of The Worm <br /> <br />\\"Little Horn\\" For some reason I like this song. It has all it needs to be a great Manson song. *Must be listened to by the lyrics alone* <br /> <br />\\"Cryptorchid\\" - Gacy's work on this song is phenomenal and the lyrics lead up to what awaits at the end of the album, overall very good song and different from any others on the album. <br /> <br />\\"Deformography\\" - This is one of the many overlooked songs on the album in my opinion but really shouldn't be. Marilyn's vocals are what pulls this song out. In my view one of the best found here. <br /> <br />\\"Wormboy\\" - The lyrics are well-written and overall is another good song on the album, not much more to say on it though. <br /> <br />\\"Mister Superstar\\" - Not very known or popular but should be by it's steady climb from somber sounding to heavy churning riffs. One of the best songs on the album and often recaptures the interest in the album if you get bored between Tourniquet and Wormboy. <br /> <br />\\"Angel With The Scabbed Wings\\" - This turns out to be the MOST underrated song on the album in my opinion. It has all the aggression and musical talent it needs to be for a good Manson song but that's not usually the case with most. Just the lyrics alone stand out to me and the music, oh god the music suits it so well. <br /> <br />Cycle III. Disintegrator Rising <br /> <br />\\"Kinderfeld\\" - This is also often overshadowed by the album's standout tracks but really is good if you give it a listen. Talent wise, nothing is wasted here. But you may think different, it all just belongs to the ear of the listener. <br /> <br />\\"Antichrist Superstar\\" - The title track and peak of the album in intensity. Manson certainly gets his point across with this song if you have failed to heed it in the previous tracks. Nothing is spared here whether it is lyrically, vocally and or your ears. <br /> <br />\\"1996\\" - Yes I will keep up with all previous reviews and agree that this is very much Irresponsible Hate Anthem Pt. II. It has the same feel of rawness and sheer hate as I.H.A. has but this is more or less the main point to what this album is about, very much like Antichrist Superstar. Overall - good song! <br /> <br />\\"The Minute Of Decay\\" - Very emotional if you read the lyrics, but the sounding of everything makes it not seem to be. That only means the boys did their job at masking that feeling in this song. very likeable and listenable to your ears. <br /> <br />\\"The Reflecting God\\" - Accoriding to his autobiography, this whole song revolves around previous Dreams and/or Nightmares that Manson had previous years before that reoccur. This is often seen as the pinnacle of Antichrist Superstar - it hits hard and heavy by both lyrical depth and thrashing guitars. Turn up the stereo on this one! <br /> <br />\\"The Man That You Fear\\" - That's right the album closer. Couldn't have been a better ending either. This song is so disturbing in lyrical content in my view that it indeed does make you truly think more about Manson as a man, a boy and more. One of the best on the album as far as I'm concerned. *A hidden track is after this song entitled \\"Empty Sounds Of Hate\\" - overall nothing too much exciting but worth a listen every once in a while. * <br /> <br />So this pretty much ends my review of this landmark album. This truly is Marilyn's brainchild and is still hugely popular today, hell I still listen to it. It was released at the right time, a time when an unsuspecting America would hear it as loud and pervasive as it is. <br /> <br />

B00006879E|5.0|This album is unbelievable and a pleasure to listen to. In fact I cannot stop listening to this album and all the songs are good, but also catchy. You be listening to the album everyday anticipating their new full length album and wondering if they can make a better album than this first album and not a sophomore jinks that most new artists with great first albums fall into, which is probably what is causing them so song to come out with another full length brand new album with original songs. If you do not like this album you must be insane or just not like pop music.
0385474547|5.0|A book loaded with memorable characters, conflicts, and dialogues. Okonkwo, with his tragic persona, remains a character anybody, irrespective of culture, can identify with. Chinua Achebe has really set the standards for the modern African novel with this book. The Igbo culture and the impact of Christianity in African are some of the elements that coalesce in making this book one of the best novels of the twentieth century. Thought-provoking, captivating,and informative. Simply brilliant!!

B0000029DD|5.0|Is he the most macho singer in the world? No. Is he one of the most fearless, gifted and soulful singers of all time? Yes. Is he as great as his father? No, but he was definitely on his way and given enough years would have been. Are the lyrics a little immature, a little too lovesick, too sensitive and simple? Yes but the music and the soul behind the music is much more mature than the actual words of the lyrics if you bother to listen and the lyrics do not get in the way of the music even if they might soften its impact a little bit more than it otherwise would have been if Jim Morrison or Peter Sinfield wrote the lyrics. How did this happen? No one knows but often people, especially artistically gifted musicians, are in their inner soul as mature as anyone has or ever will be at a young age and this does not necessarily come out in their daily lives or in their actual words but only when they freely express themselves through music. There are hundreds of musicians whose music is much more poetic and infinitely deeper than the mere words of their lyrics by themselves will ever be. Basically it's the music that counts and the lyrics are problematic only when they stand in the way of the music coming out or ruin the music by pigeon-holing it into certain limited perspectives.<br /><br />The best way to listen to this album is from beginning to end as one work and keep playing it 3 or 4 times on repeat until you become used to it. All the songs are excellent and work better as part of one extended work or little sketches that complete the puzzle of the Buckley soul. Don't judge it too harshly on first listen when you spot a couple of things here and there you can criticize. The whole is much greater than the parts. Let the music grow on you and by the third or fourth listen all your criticisms will start to disappear and you'll start to really like and even love this album and when \\"Lilac Wine\\" comes up you might even be surprised to notice a few hot tears making their descent down your cheeks.  That's when you'll know that Buckley's inner soul and what he was trying so hard to communicate got to you despite yourself.ent down your cheeks.

B000ASDFJU|4.0|This is a good DVD set as you get all the episodes, however I think the picture quality could have been better. This is my second set as my first one was faulty and would not play some of the episodes. Amazon was excellent with their customer service to let me exchange it. My new set has no problems.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I was very surprised by how entertaining this movie was whithout going to extremes in fiction scenes.   They kept it pretty realistic (with the exception of maybe the first chase).   I hope future Bond films keep this line.   <br /> <br />In regards to the HD digital transfer it's excellent.  Among the best I've seen so far in Blu-Ray.
031286504X|5.0|I was stunned to learn that this story is actually a short novella, and even more stunned that Richard Matheson was able to pack so much into so few pages.<br /><br />The story of a last man standing in a world radically altered by a virus that turns the world's population into a human/vampire species, is singularly focused through the eyes of our hero, Robert Neville, and written with a focus that makes this tale very powerful.<br /><br />Matheson draws the reader into Robert Neville's plight quickly, and then effortlessly begins to build the tension of psychological torture he feels during his days and nights alone, trapped within his house and his thoughts.  The secondary horror is trying to stay a step a head of a nightly group of Vampires looking to, of course, drink his blood.  The skill of Matheson forces the reader into this hell of loneliness and really sells this horror from all angles.  From resisting his desires, to controlling his anger, to repressing his memory and longing for the world before the virus; the mental pain Robert Neville experiences in a society where he doesn't belong is stunningly told.<br /><br />An interesting twist is how Matheson uses the Vampire legend to feed into our beliefs and superstitions, and then tears those beliefs down by introducing scientific explanations to our understanding of Vampires and our role in society.  Why does garlic repulse Vampires?  Why is blood important to Vampires?  What is the significance of the cross?  By examining these questions, and other things, Matheson makes these \\"monsters\\" much more human and sympathetic, leaving us wondering: Who are the monsters and who are the victims?<br /><br />The ending is superb and shocking.  What a terrific book.<br />.<br />As a bonus, the book has 10 additional short stories that are well worth reading.  I had to laugh when I read \\"Prey\\" because I had no idea that the horrible \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" film staring Karen Black was based on his story.  Horrible film but good story.

B000LPQ6DE|2.0|I bought this DVD on the strength of the reviews I read.  However, I was disappointed in it.  I have 3 other versions of the story which I think are much better.  Seeing this one, I couldn't help but feel that the actors were acting as if they were acting.  They didn't seem real.  Rochester wasn't too bad, but Jane was quite stiff, it seemed to me.  She is such a quiet, rather timid soul, most of her deep emotions have to show through her facial expressions, her eyes, which many times were tepid.  When she looked at her employer, there was no affection in her eyes, only coldness (until he expressed his love for her).  If you love someone, it is only natural that it show through your eyes, no matter how hard you may try to conceal it.  Other reviewers may disagree with me.  That's life.  I too am on an Eyre-a-thon.  I do this with Jane Austen's tales as well.  Have just back-ordered on DVD the 1944 Orson Welles-Joan Fontaine version of \\"Jane Eyre\\" which reviewers have raved about on VHS.  I can believe this, for those two stars are quite remarkable.

B000M4RG42|2.0|I bought this movie for a friend, but he and I watched it together, totally immersed in the vivid scenes of the horrors of war. The acting was superb. The cover-up not a surprise knowing how politics these days works. I strongly recommend seeing this film and hopefully seeing it will help us all to honor the dead who willingly gave their lives for their country. It's riveting - and the young man who played the \\"Chief\\" was superior.

0743243315|4.0|Brick Lane is a novel about Nazneen, a Bangladeshi woman who moves to London for an arranged marriage with a Bangladeshi man who had been living there for several years before. In the background of the story is the pre and post 9/11 lives of Muslim immigrants in the west provided from Nazneen's perspective. The character struggles with the question \\"can people change their fate?\\" Nazneen herself was born as a very weak baby and was left to her fate by her family because they believed one should not intervene with what has been planned for them. But Nazneen also doubts \\"if one changes the course of fate, may be their fate was such that the course of events were meant to be altered anyway.\\"      The book became controversial in the Bangladeshi community in London especially when a film based on the book was planned to be made. Some felt that the book or the film would give the wrong impression about Bangladeshi life in London.    This book was a difficult read for me since I did not really feel much affection for any of the characters. This may of course be because the author made them so real that they had all the faults that real people have.
B000J10ERO|5.0|I was looking forward to this film, not only because its Superman but also because this was to be my sons first film at a cinema (Who was 4 at the time of its release and loves anything to do with Superhero's)<br /><br />Let me just say I get really annoyed with the comparisons to the Smallville TV show and how thats the direction they should have gone on for this Film!<br /><br />That TV show is rubbish in my opinion, Its the X-Files with the guy from Cheaper by the Dozen playing a guy who is supposed to be Clark Kent and the whole thing is underwhelming and Flat!!<br /><br />Now thats out the way, I love the way Superman Returns relates back to the first 2 Christopher Reeves films and doesnt totally disregard all the good work that was done on those earlier films.<br /><br />Marlon Brandos Jor El was tearfully resonant, Kevin Spaceys post Jail Luthor is the perfect balance to Gene Hackmans pre jail Luthor, Brandon Routh looks the part yet still feels slightly akward which fits in with the fact that Clark Kent has been away for 5 years and comes back and tries to quietly slip back into his old life whilst doubting weather or not there is still a place for Superman, Great stuff.<br /><br />I can not wait for the sequal as this film has re-introduced me to Superman, Its hooked my Son, and now that Superman has returned lets see what he can really do!<br /><br />I implore everyone to see this film! You wont be disapointed!<br /><br />PS<br /><br />My Son loved the film, he spent the rest of the summer running around pretending to be Superman, Christmas that year was very much Superman orientated, it has made a great bond between us since one of the first films i remember as a kid was Superman 3 and seeing my sons reaction to this film is priceless, So how many films these days can do that?

B00026WU7I|4.0|Another classic from Dylan, and possibly his last real masterpiece. I prefer Blonde on Blonde, but there's not much to take issue with on Blood on the Tracks; it's subtle but solid from start to finish. (Just as an aside, I never realized how much Bob sounds like a cross between Lou Reed and Ian Hunter at times.)
B00003CX9E|2.0|Maybe I just didn't get it, but why do people like this movie so much?  It's mostly lame with hints of promise and then the whole thing just peters out.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this turkey yet, go rent \\"I Love Trouble,\\" which has the always sparkling Julia Roberts and the no-less sparkling Nick Nolte as a newspaper man (Nolte) and a newspaper woman (Roberts) who fall in love.<br /><br />Nick Nolte has done some fine work is \\"48 Hours,\\" \\"3 Fugitives\\" and others in his numbered series (I believe he is also on the wonderful show \\"2 1/2 Men,\\" playing one of the full men, not the 1/2 man).  Julia Roberts is always a treat, and you may know her from \\"Pretty Women\\" or \\"Hook.\\"  The two perform beautifully as they tell jokes to each other, write for newspapers, and fall in love in the process.  Is it their cantankerous relationship that draws them together, or the dizzying smell of newsprint, or both?  It really doesn't matter because this puppy is a real cinematic treat.<br /><br />\\"Citizen Kane,\\" by contrast is the weaker of the two films as it follows Orson Welles playing a man named Citizen Kane (hello, unbelievable character name, anyone?) who writes for newspapers and likes snowglobes, showgirls, rosebuds, and getting older and wider.  That's about it in a nutshell.  I know this movie is supposed to be really old, so it is a \\"classic,\\" but it doesn't even make any sense.  It's also kind of like \\"Newsies\\" without the music.<br /><br />They might consider remaking this film and might I suggest Bernie Mac as an Internet newspaper man who besides trying to jazz up his daily blog has to care for two foster kids and maybe a dog.  The Hollywood writers can probably come up with some more details to flesh it out--I'm just spitballing here--but I think with a little finesse and maybe a cameo reuniting him with Ashton Kutcher, this could be a very decent film.<br /><br />Anyway, if you haven't seen the original film, you should save your money and go out and buy a Walkman or an exotic fruit of some sort.  You'll thank me!a Walkman or an exotic fruit of some sort.  You'll thank me!
B0000024W3|1.0|To say that this album is uneven is actually giving it more credit than it deserves; it's uneven like the Titanic plunging stern first into the Atlantic. Yes, there are a few noteworthy tracks, but for the most part it's a forgettable collection. Dylan must have really been at loose ends to put this one together.

If for nothing else, the way I approach other people now, is worth the time to use the Secret.

B000H0MKGK|1.0|zzzzzzzzzzz...zzzzzzzzzz....zzzzzzzzz....oh, ahem, excuse me. <br />This album put me to sleep because it is so boring. The album opens with a cover of Marvin Gaye's \\"Sexual Healing\\", which in the middle, breaks to an instrumental of \\"What's Going On\\". As for the rest? BO-RING. This is as cookie-cutter and sterile as adult contemporary music gets. Where's the justification for all the acclaim? I certainly don't hear it. Musicianship? Nothing noteworthy, just by-the-numbers work that sounds like the product of non-creative session men / women. This is the kind of music people brainlessly clap their hands to in a pathetic attempt to \\"feel\\" it. It's also the kind of album fans of it will look back on in 10 years and ask of themselves: \\"I liked THAT? Maybe I can sell it for 10 cents during a yard sale\\".
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I actually wanted the London cast recording! But this is also ok. If you have never seen this musical then you definatly should buy the album as there are SO MANY wonderful songs. However if you saw the show and have the CD it might not do it justice. Nothing better than the real thing. Personally I think the London cast is more exceptional... so buy the London cast recording if you can.

B0009P42S2|2.0|I'd almost be willing to give five stars for the background animation alone.  The moody colors, amazing 3D drawn landscapes, and the detail in the steam machinery were incredible eye-candy, and will delight any fan of animation. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the plot is nonsensical (even for anime), the characters are truly terrible, and the cell-style 2D character animation style jars horribly with the 3D backgrounds.  The characters in *Steamboy* look like amaturish paper cutouts laid over the background of a completely different movie.  Even the colors don't match.  (Imagine Inuyasha appearing in a scene from *Full Metal Alchemist*, and you'll get the picture). <br /> <br />I don't really know how to review this movie, because I'm so astonished by how good the background animation is.  It's some of the best I've seen anywhere, yet it has these horrible 2D characters that aren't even nearly as well animated and seem to be taken from a different movie.  The plot, such as it is, seems to have tacked on at the very last minute, and has already been ably evicerated by other reviewers. <br /> <br />Not recommended except for technical animation fans.  Too bad the DVD doesn't have a \\"remove characters and dialog\\" option.  I'd seriously rate it higher, since the Victorian diorama-style backgrounds are truly remarkable.
1594200696|2.0|In theory, I would completely approve of the idea of enlivening this useful classic writing guide with illustrations. However, having examined this particular edition, I can't get past the horrifying error at the top of page 147, in which the spelling \\"principle\\" is substituted for the correct form of the adjective \\"principal,\\" as in \\"main,\\" or \\"chief.\\" This passage is supposedly from the introduction to the book's first edition by William Strunk, Jr., who would have made no such mistake. (It is however a common one, to judge by its appearance in at least one of the Amazon reader reviews of this book).<br /><br />Didn't anyone at The Penguin Press proofread this book? To introduce this type of basic error into a revered reference book is an unforgiveable disservice to the masters of writing. Strunk and White must be rolling over in their graves...

B000B2YQX4|5.0|It's a Rosetta Stone.<br /><br />This album is a kind of Depeche Mode Rosetta Stone, you know: sulky, stripped down, amped up, Gahan & Gore fiddling around with decibels and sonic dissonance and ramping around between shrill and sublime, distant thunder & the peal of entire audial galaxies being ripped asunder.<br /><br />Rosetta Stone, though? Oh yes: listening to this---this wicked, melancholic, happily sinister, pulsing, throbbing slice of musical darkness---listening to \\"Playing the Angel\\" almost justifies the existence of \\"Exciter\\", explains it, makes sense of it. I hated \\"Exciter\\" when it came out: slow, dull, saccharine, lounge-ey.<br /><br />But \\"Playing the Angel\\", oddly, has reframed \\"Exciter\\" for me, made it---a little alluring. It's still, at best, pure chill music, no doubt, but in light of this happily infernal Depeche outting, it's not as warty or nasty.<br /><br />It's like Depeche Mode is probing, poking around, carving away their own little technically perfect inner sanctum of surgically engineered, manipulated noise. Evolving, maybe mutating.<br /><br />It's good stuff. There are some good old club-rattling monsters here: \\"John the Revelator\\", which ratchets up with an industrial howl that sounds like an unhinged air-raid klaxon, and calls to mind the dancehall days of \\"Black Celebration\\": but this is not Depeche Mode in full retreat. Not at all.<br /><br />It's not an escape into eighties retro, either. I think \\"Playing the Angel\\" builds on \\"Exciter\\", takes a scalpel out, refines the delicious, addictive electronic adventurism going on there: \\"Pain I'm Used To\\", \\"Suffer Well\\", \\"Precious\\", \\"Macro\\", \\"Nothing's Impossible\\", \\"Darkest Sun\\"---all of these dragoon the technical perfection of \\"Exciter\\" and step the groove up a notch. It's damned sure not boring.<br /><br />The result is a fusion of Dark Bliss, and what is possibly Depeche Mode's best album. *Ever*.<br /><br />JSG

They are:<br /><br />1) \\"I'm a Kabbalist! Betcha don't know what that is!\\"<br /><br />2) \\"I have feathery seventies hair! All you girls should get it, it's the latest thing! It makes me wanna shake that thang, shake it shake it shake it shake it SHAKE THAT THANG, SHAKE DAT BOOTY!\\"<br /><br />3) \\"I went to Africa and all Guy Ritchie got was this lousy African child.\\"<br /><br />4) \\"Does this leotard make my butt look fat?\\"<br /><br />5) \\"I'm just a squirrel, on the dance floor, lookin' for a Nut, to shake your Butt, to make you SHAKE IT SHAKE IT SHAKE DAT THANG, SHAKE IT ALL NIGHT!\\"<br /><br />It's all good, though. As usual, Madonna just rocks it up old school all night long and shakes DAT booty, yo. Word. Straight up.<br /><br />OK, back to the point: bottom line, Madonna is a generous artist. After all, it was awful nice of her to let her grandma strike a pose on the album cover.<br /><br />JSG
B000002UA9|5.0|I lived in England and I had my 15th birthday a month after 'Love Me Do' was released as a single. I first heard it on a short-wave radio broadcast on Radio Luxembourg, from the other side of the English Channel. At that time the only radio available in England was the BBC, which had 'Pick of the Pops' on Sunday afternoon and that was about it for pop music. I loved this bouncy, fresh sound, which was unlike anything else in pop at that time.    In January 1963, 'Please Please Me', the single, was released. A few weeks later, the Record Mirror said 'Wow! The Beatles challenge.' as they went from #16 to #3 in one week. By April, The Beatles were grabbing the imagination of every teenager in Britain. The debut album, 'Please Please Me',  was released, went to #1 in the album chart and stayed there for 29 weeks until it was replaced by 'With The Beatles', the boys' second British album. In America, Bobby Vinton had the last number one hit ('There! I've Said It Again') before The Beatles hit the US charts in a way never seen before or since.    This album is an historic milestone in popular music. It established so many new features that changed music forever. First and foremost, it was the first album produced by a young pop band where the artists wrote the majority of the songs- 8 of the 14 were originals. These days, it's hard to remember that this just didn't happen back then. Second, this was a white, British band not only playing real rock and roll, but writing it, too. 'I Saw Her Standing There' opened a whole new vista for bands all over the world. Third, the variety on this album is amazing- rock, pop, ballads, harmony songs, even adult contemporary. Nobody else had even attempted to cross boundaries in this way. Fourth, this was an album where all the members were featured- not a lead singer with  the rest backing him. All four band members sang lead on at least one song, and it was clear from the start that the band had two completely different but complementary lead singers, both of whom sang rock and ballads. Fifth, this was an album that sounded as though the band was performing, as indeed they were. No lush strings, no overdubs, no backing singers other then the group members. It was the band's record, not the product of the producer.    Finally, this was the first record where the personality of the band was as important as the songs. The Beatles were uniquely and distinctly themselves- they sounded like no-one else and no-one ever sounded like them. They turned popular music from the property of the studios to the property of the artists. Every singer-songwriter recording today owes a massive debt to them..       I was there. I heard them at the start of their recording career and followed them until they broke up. I was a member of their fan club. I saw them live, at their first Christmas show. I'm not sure it's possible for anyone who didn't live through it to understand exactly how tremendous the change was that they wrought and how all-encompassing their popularity and influence were. They changed, not only music, but broadcasting, fashion, culture- the way of life in the Western world. This was the album that started it all and for me every track is a memory of a time when things changed forever. Pop music was a minor, largely ignored part of youth culture- and then came The Beatles.

Gaiman has never disapointed me and has always over exceeded my expectations. Stardust is no exception to this.<br /><br />Stardust is the beautiful story of Tristran Thorn and a fallen star. The story takes place in the village of Wall, but mostly in Faerie, located right outside of Wall. Every nine years, the inhabitants and creatures of the land of Faerie host a market right outside of Wall. People come from all over the world to visit the market where all sorts of magical things are traded for promises and contracts. Young Tristran Thorn is a product of this market as the reader will discover in the early chapters. Tristran falls in love with Victoria Forester, and on one night vows that if she will marry him, he will retrieve a fallen star that has fallen into Faerie. Stardust is the story of finding that star.<br /><br />Tristran is not the only person looking for the fallen star. There are three princes who's right to the throne depends on finding the star and there is a witch who seeks the star so that she may gain the beauty of youth. It is Tristran who finds the star first and we find that the star is a beautiful woman named Yvaine. I'll leave the rest of the thrilling, warm, romantic, awe inspiring story to the reader.<br /><br />Stardust is one of the most magical books I have read in a long time. Gaiman has an amazing ability as an author to pick the perfect word each and every time. I felt a warmth inside the whole time I read this book. It's absolutely beautiful and everything that fantasy should be. He has a gift like no other when it comes to his power with words and ideas. This is very much a classic fairytale, but at the same time, he makes it just not another fairytale. There are witches, princesses, spells, talking things that don't normally talk, castles, revenge, romance, yet it is such a beautifully unique book.<br /><br />There is another version of this book that was illustrated by the amazing Charles Vess that was published in 1999, and I would love to get my hands on that. Gaiman and Vess are releasing yet another version of Stardust on May 2nd with all new illustrations that will be published by Vertigo.<br /><br />In addition, we can all look forward to Stardust the movie to debut in August I believe. I can't wait to see this movie on the screen, but at the same time, I have my apprehensions. I'm having a hard time picturing Michelle Pfeifer as the witch and with Robert DeNiro as anything at all. But I have no doubt at the same time that I shall enjoy it.<br /><br />Add this book to your collection if you don't already have it. It's a beautiful story that you'll want to start all over again as soon as you turn the last page.is such a beautifully unique book.<br /><br />There is another version of this book that was illustrated by the amazing Charles Vess that was published in 1999, and I would love to get my hands on that.

B00005JO20|5.0|Jaw-dropping.  Heart-stopping.  Heartbreakingly tragic and sad.  All those and more describe the best movie of `05 & one of the best of all-time.  King Kong has always been a classic idea but neither the `33 original or the `78 remake was able to develop a fully realized story. <br /> <br />Jackson somehow managed to push all the right buttons: keeping the original characters (albeit with neccessary personality changes) while making them more 3-dimensional than either the `33 original or the `78 remake was able to, adding welcome new characters, keeping the prehistoric Skull Island from the original that was so full of life & dangers and the decision to keep it set in 1933.  Jackson's true stroke of genius began around the 1:20 mark when he did what the first 2 writers should've done: he developed a mutual bond between Ann & Kong, breaking the `creature feature' mold.  From then on, Ann (who's instantly a likeable, sympathetic character) goes on a rollercoaster ride of sad, sadder, & saddest starting with her rescue from some hungry T-Rexes that leads to a growing affection for Kong to her tragic mistake of trying to escape with Jack that leads to Kong's capture to her reunion with him & the tragedy that follows.  You're left with the feeling she regrets ever leaving the jungle but not ever having met Kong. <br /> <br />If I listed everything I loved about this film, it would be a page long.  So, let me finish by saying this: for a movie I almost passed on watching (fearing it would be just a fancy remake), this was one of the best, thrilling, saddest, sweetest & most satisfying movies I've ever seen.  Even after 20+ viewings.
B000I5X80G|4.0|This is a gem and a must have for all Neil's fans.  This performance shows the power and passion that was Crazy Horse. Of particular note are the strong support performances by Danny Whitten, who was one of the most underrated musicians of this era.  A fine guitarist and a muscular vocalist, Whitten shines throughout. Even though this version of Common Baby Let's Go Downtown surfaced on Tonight's the Night years ago, it's nice to see it packaged with the concert from where it originally came. A great archival document for Neil Young followers and the uninitiated as well.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Buy it!!!  It's the best one yet and it's a sure deal on great entertainment and action!
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Without trying to sound hyperbolic or melodramatic, this is quite simply the best solo, singer/songwriter live performance I have ever heard committed to tape. The sound quality is superb and this is representative of what great talent sounded like back in the day when giants performed with just their songs, a guitar or piano, and a vocal mic. Captured on a night when Young had it all going on, this is a musical document for the ages.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|Love her voice.  If you like her other albums you will love this one as well.
1582701709|1.0|You too can make millions of dollars by way of blind consumerism and false advertising.  The secret is that there is no secret, which you'll find out AFTER you shell out the $$ for this pointless book (or DVD).  The content here isn't worth the paper that it's written on.
B000GY729M|4.0|It has a lot of great songs.  Some are not my favorite but all and all well worth the money.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|So there I was browsing books at my favorite Barnes and Noble book store. While looking at all the new arrivals I heard the most beautiful music begin to play. At first I hummed along and continued to browse the books. My mood was uplifted almost immediately. When Caledonia began to play I made my way back to the music department to see what was playing. It was this CD. I purchased a copy of the CD right then and there. Now I've had the CD home for a little over two weeks and I've listened to it already countless times. It has the power to make the commute to work happier, housework less tiresome, writing more productive.<br /><br />This excellent CD is populated with excellent orchestral music accompanied by the most crystal clear angelic voices you'll ever hear. Two favorites are The Prayer and Calendonia. There isn't a single dud on this CD.<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD and have already purchased others by this group of talented artists. This is one of the best CD purchases I have ever made. I am quite sure that if you like well done celtic music or just love music period, that this would be a great purchase you'll never regret.

B000MGUZMU|4.0|arcade fire's first album, funeral, was nothing less than majestic--grand and ambitious in scope, full of dramatic archs, well balanced, carefully crafted lyrics.  and it had rebellion on it, as well, which didn't hurt it's stock any. <br />has the surprise (schtick) worn off?  has arcade fire outdone itself with the follow-up, neon bible?  i would say the answer to both questions is \\"no.\\"  arcade fire is still full of surprises.  there are some very strong tracks here.  it's impossible not to bob your head to black mirror, with it's sinister guitar licks and pounding bass.  my personal favorite track is ocean of noise, which is captivating from it's first notes and doesn't take multiple listens to appreciate, as with songs like \\"the well and the lighthouse.\\"  \\"my body is a cage\\" is an extremely heavy song--with an incredibly emotional build-up that leaves you near exhaustion at the end of each listen.   <br />still, though, even with these high points, i'm not sure \\"neon bible\\" is an improvement over \\"funeral.\\"  it is, perhaps, more mature in some respects, but it's songs are not as consistently good as the songs on the debut.  many of these reviewers love \\"no cars go.\\"  i must confess, i liked the song as well--when i heard it on the ep years ago.  it's a good song, but it seems out of place here (as it is very upbeat and poppy, which many of the other tracks have a much darker feel).  plus, there are only 11 tracks on this album, and i can't help but feel a little bummed that one of those tracks is a repeat from the ep (and not that much of an improvement over the original, if at all).  maybe win had some writer's block.  further, there are some other songs that, while good, do not feel fleshed out enough or attempt to be overly political and/or dramatic, to the point of near-cheesiness.  these songs include \\"neon bible,\\" which is very catchy with it's low-key, mesmorizing tempo but ends too quickly and feels incomplete; and \\"windowsill\\" which makes me cringe everytime i hear \\"i don't want to live in america no more.\\"  uhh, you don't live in america.  if i wrote a song about not wanting to live in canada anymore, i would expect people to cringe too.  i know, i know, \\"america started the iraqi war and many of the citizens are fed up.\\"  doesn't stop the cringe. <br />so, in closure--worth the buy and numerous listens.  obviously a great band and a great album.  too tough to top funeral, but i'm sure they'll find a way at some point over the course of what, no doubt, will be a long and fruitful musical career.  in all fairness, this would be a five star review if i was writing for a band that i didn't expect perfection from (which is pretty unfair...).
B000LAZDQA|4.0|To say this movie isn't about sex does it an injustice.  The main characters in the movie are unable to connect sexually with their partners.  Sex is a metaphor for intimacy, therefore \\"good, fulfilling sex\\" will solve their relationship problems.  The \\"principles\\" all end up at the club \\"Shortbus\\" to sexually experiment. But this only serves to highlight their unresolved issues.  The director did give the principles a happy ending, but getting there is unclear.  Maybe its on the cutting room floor.      The storyline is imaginative.  The acting average.  But there is nothing ground-breaking about this movie, as demonstrated by its low box office and no clear path as to how the characters overcame their crisis.  Sex is as normal as drinking water. Sex is also an emotion not just an act.  The director said he wanted to make an honest movie about sex, well, his movie just showed sex acts with no emotion, no feelings.  You can't have the \\"act\\" without the emotion and try and call it \\"art\\".    People who disparage this movie (for its real-sex acts) prefer to keep their intimacy private.  People who high-five this movie have no issue with sharing their intimacy with strangers.    As for the pornographic label, this movie is weak at best.  I didn't notice people getting turned-on in their seats by the real sex acts filmed in this movie.  But if they did, so what!!!  Porn is a block buster industry in America.    I liken this movie to any \\"Woody Allen neuroses New York\\" movie but with \\"money-shots\\".

B00005B1W5|5.0|GIFTED AND TALENTED COMPOSERS LIKE YANNI ARE LIKE RAINBOWS, 'RARE & BEAUTIFUL'. THE FACT THAT HE CHOSE TO SHARE HIS INNER BEAUTY AND INSPIRATION IN THE FORM OF MUSIC WITH THE WORLD ONLY SHOWS YET ANOTHER OF HIS GIFTED QUALITIES, HIS LOVE AND COMPASSION FOR LIFE AND HUMANITY. IF ONLY WE HAD MORE PEOPLE LIKE YANNI, THIS WOULD BE A MORE PEACEFUL AND SERENE WORLD. THANK YOU YANNI.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This movie is well done.  If you like Edward Norton, you definetly won't be disappointed.
B0000028PI|3.0|Cooper her indulges himself with a semi-concept album that addresses a number of social issues, largely about teenage angst and feelings of needing to belong. All of which have been very fertile fields for hard rock and metal for many moons. However there is not the feeling of any sort of sell out such as was visible on Trash, for instance. Not that this prevented his older fans ignoring this release in droves, meaning that his live disc from '97 (A Fistful of Alice) contains just one song from this album only a few years after this was put out. Which shows that not even the mighty Alice can drag his fans into the present, they vastly prefer to hear the standards of their youth repeated ad nauseum.<br /><br />Points regarding this mid 90's release from the shock/hard rocker would include;<br /><br />A) Though this is a concept album you don't really need to bother with the storyline to enjoy the tunes. Which is a huge plus with concept albums. And the music is pretty tight, Alice having left far behind most of his shambolic tendencies for more straightforward hard rock with a vaudevillian sheen.<br /><br />B) The release originally came with a comic book, part 1 of a set of three which were written by Neil Gaiman based on a concept developed by him and Alice. Which screams of a 70's style cheesy gimmick worthy of KISS but since comics are huge business around the world it's perhaps surprising more bands don't try similar tie-ins. It's certainly different.<br /><br />C) Alice is in fine voice here, well for him that's a relative term but thus far the ravages of time have left his voice alone. Or is even time afraid of Alice?<br /><br />D) While a number of songs aren't too bad, they do mostly scoot by the listener without leaving any impression at all. Which is pretty damning when you consider that dull is something very rarely associated with the worlds most notorious shock rocker. This chorus' aren't memorable and apart from Lost in America few tunes demand extra plays. It all leaves the listener underwhelmed and perhaps makes this album the most anonymous of the Coops albums since his early 80's daze.nd extra plays.

B00006AVRK|5.0|If you're a Hugh Laurie fan and looking for more \\"House MD\\" you won't enjoy this set.  But he exhibits great talent (as does Stephen Fry) in this enjoyable set.
B0000026T4|4.0|Old skool heavy rock fans hate this album. They hate the whiff of sellout, the guest appearances like the co-writing with Desmond Child, Richie Sambora and Jon Bon Jovi. They hate the fact that people as varies as Stiv Bator, Steve Lukather and a whole heap of Aerosmith and girlie faves like Kane Roberts and Kip Winger were also features. Particularly in relation to the latter two mentioned, they take umbrage that such third tier types were in posession of bigger profiles than their teenage shock rock idol circa '89.<br /><br />The simple fact is that this sort of collaboration is exactly what Alice needed to bring him up to date. To bring his legacy to a new generation and the plain truth is that since this album the Coop has never fallen off the radar as badly as he had with dross such as Special Forces and Da.<br /><br />The worst things that could be said of this album are that it's a cop out with all the extra writers and that it's a shameless sellout. But even a sellout is better than what we'd put up with prior to this release.<br /><br />But just cos I'm not someone who was 18 when Billion Dollar Babies came out and therefore feel obliged to hate everything that came after doesn't mean I find this album faultess. Far from it. So, IMHO;<br /><br />- Poison is a great song and a great way to start an album. Other highlights would be Bed of Nails in a cheesy sort of way and Spark in the Dark and House of Fire scoot along quickly enough that you almost don't notice the shaky musical premises their built on. Nicely flowing chorus' on tunes such as This Maniacs in Love With You and the visceral vocal performance of Why Trust You (a little out of place on a disc so smoothly produced by Desmond Child) lift these tunes to at least bog standard level.<br /><br />- However despite Alice trying to talk it up at the time, Only My Heart Talkin' was never gonna have much impact on the charts. And Hell is Living Without You is filler while I'm Your Gun - well they probably figured that if they tacked it onto the end of the album nobody would notice it. And given the calibre of the songwriters here it's pretty scary they couldn't come upwith at least ten decent tunes.<br /><br />- Alice Cooper still has something about him on pretty much any release he touches. And his brand of shock rock that at times delved into art rock is here fairly streamlined into mainstream late 80's hard rock. The riffs are clean, the production nice and when it does work it works pretty darn well. For heavens sake even Barry Manilow loving housewives like my mother liked Poison the thing was so darn catchy!<br /><br />This slice of corporate rock ain't the best Coop product by a fair margin. But it gave him back the commercial impetus to relaunch his career and he subsequently grabbed that chance with both hands so regardless of what the purists may think this is an important album in the mans cataluge, but not always for the music itself.end of the album nobody would notice it.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Keep an open mind and then watch this.  If you've dug in your heels about disagreeing with Gore, you're going to hate this but - then again - you're going to hate anything that advocates dealing with global warming.  I'm forever bothered about the debate behind this being liberal vs. conservative.  It shouldn't be.

B000002MFE|5.0|Unlike many in the music business who rely on studio wizardy, excessive charm, or fearlessness, Clapton built - and kept - his reputation based on one simple fact: the man plays guitar better than just about anyone, ever. Whether he's playing his own compositions, blues standards, or rock, Clapton engages the listener with a passion few can match. <br /> <br />Unplugged shows a different side of Clapton, a side I believe is his best. You feel his pain in Heaven and frivolity in Milk Cow Blues. He's having fun and sharing the experience with you. This CD is one you can play over and over again. Even today, 15 years after its release, it stands the test of time and still brings a big smile to those who listen. Highly recommended.
032147404X|5.0|This author has a goofy sence of humor. Stick with the reading and you will learn some important things that makes this book well worth the price.
0743496728|5.0|After a very disappointing THE TENTH CIRCLE, Jodi Picoult rebounds with the excellent NINETEEN MINUTES.  This book, which centers on a school shooting, is one of her best yet. <br /> <br />Picoult really knows how to develop her characters.  Each one is well defined and real. I totally believed the way the characters were portrayed, especially Lacy and Peter.  And yes, I found myself having a great deal of sympathy for Peter.  Some could say that the characters were a bit clichéd (Matt, the abusive boyfriend, Josie, the wanna-be, Lacy, the mother without a clue, etc.), but I think these characters are reflective of a great many people in the real world.  I also liked the way Picoult used Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a defense for Peter.  Wonderfully done.  I give credit to Picoult for always addressing issues in her books that are topical and thought provoking. <br /> <br />I've read some reviews that criticize Picoult for not having the character of Alex recuse herself as judge at the trial.  This is totally becomes a non-issue as you will see as your continue reading.  Also, regarding the \\"twist\\" ending I've seen some complaints about, it's not such a twist if you are paying attention as you read.  It's actually quite obvious from very early on in the story. <br /> <br />I enjoy the fact that Picoult brought back characters from previous books (Patrick from PERFECT MATCH and Jordan from SALEM FALLS and THE PACT.)  I understand that Ian from KEEPING FAITH makes an appearance in her next book.  I definitely look forward to it.
B000M341QE|5.0|The movie has everything you can ask for.  The action was great, fantastic acting, and a story that is unparalled to anything recent.  Highly reccomend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it.
B000M5AJQ8|4.0|Can't really tell the difference between the HD and SD versions.  The movie is full of stars and each one performs to their maximum ability.  Good twist to the story line.  I'm not a prude but would have been better if the \\"F\\" word had been significantly reduced in the dialog.  Not real anxious to view a 2nd time.
B000N3AXQU|4.0|We've seen it all before in the other 5 Rocky's, but it never stops grabbing you and hoping against hope that the underdog will somehow make out. Sylvester Stallone And Burt Young are great as Rocky and Pauly but the world champ that Rocky came up against in the movie did not come over as strong or mean enough,he was not convincing, a bit insipient, the ending could have been better but was ok as it hedged the bet both ways. Buying this on Blu-ray too.
B000BCE918|5.0|I love this trilogy and the set is quite pretty. Every picture has Spanish and other languages in subtitles (it's not specified). It got faster than I was expecting and in very good shape, expect that one disc was out of place but fortunately without a scratch.

0143038419|5.0|Gilbert's book is shockingly beautiful - both in the description of the places that she travels to and it's ability to take the reader to an entirely new level of soul searching. Gilbert's words are real - not the pedantic, all too often seen \\"lesson on how to be better,\\" - but rather an affirmation that even at our worst, we are capable of grabing hold of our own lives and making them everything that they aught to be.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|In the beginning, Daft Punk began solely as a trance-y, dance-y, electronic kind of group, particularily with the release of \\"Homework\\", which I feel is a two-and-a-half star album. Now, \\"Discovery\\" is the best thing Thomas Bangalter and Guy Manuel De Homem-Christo released, filled with nostalgic, disco-style tunes that fit correctly in its great production. \\"Human After All\\" has more attention to guitars, which I feel are great but the songs are repetitive and not well produced. Why didn't they cut the songs short, like two-minutes long? No, instead they made it into five-minute long tunes that definitively test the listener's patience. Not a great album but one that could have been tidied up much, much better.
B000060OWV|1.0|Great guitarist with a terrible voice. I can't beleive someone hasn't broke the news to Robben that HE CAN'T SING FOR S**T. At least Joe Satriani got a clue. Some artists who suffer from this affliction have learned to limit the damage by accentuiating the positive but not Robben. Too bad because, again, he is a very gifted guitarist with who feels the rhythm and soul of the guitar. I wouldn't buy more of his stuff right now.
B000055Y0X|4.0|Stanley Kubrick's \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" is one of the best films I have ever seen, mainly driven by its screenplay and acting. Sure, Peter Sellers' triple performance such as the president, Dr. Strangelove, and the assitant military personnel are great, but nontheless, George C. Scott's performance as the general is amazing. His complicated gestures, eye shifts, eyebrow twitching --everything is fit into detail. He is the actor who really acts. I can not recall any other actor who has managed to do this kind of acting but as far as I know, Scott has the ticket to do it with ease.
6304712936|5.0|This story is timeless and captures the unexpected life of the genius which is mozart. I love the story because Saliere is so relatable. Although Mozart demonstrates effortless talent, his character is likable because he is so human. I think we can all find these characters somewhere in our lives.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This film is by far one of the most entertaining, important, amazing, and a landmark in the history of cinema. \\"Seven Samurai\\" is breathtaking, and even though it is long, it really isn't. One gets thoroughly involved in the story, calmly getting to know each character and how they turn out to be. It is filled with delicate humor and human philosophy, and one of the best things about this film is the climactic battle sequence in the rain, with many shots taken to envelop the audience in the intense, arduous action in the rain and mud. No other film in history has dared to compare to this landmark film, and \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" did not match its potential. I personally did not find \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" great, for I just kept thinking about how they replicated \\"Seven Samurai\\". Everyone who loves movies should watch this film. It reminds us why we see classic movies for its everlasting beauty and evolution to this generation.
0060794410|3.0|I've heard so much about this book that I had very high expectations.  Unfortunately, I can't see what all the hoopla is all about.  It's very long for just a few important concepts.  The use of \\"research\\" to \\"prove\\" his theory is somewhat helpful, although I'm sure there are those who could refute his methodology.  I found Mr. Collins' style of narration very distracting and difficult to withstand.  I wish he had used someone else to narrate his book.  Well I guess anyone interested in leadership  and executive training still has to read this stuff.  Don't read or listen late at night if you want to get through it, unless you need a book to go to sleep by.
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is a must-have. Very emotional and evocative. Oddly, on first listen, I actually wasn't impressed. But this has grown to become one of my all-time favourite albums. Coldplay's finest release as of yet.<br />Update:  IMO, this album remains as Coldplay's best release. (disappointed with their albums that have followed)
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I could listen to this CD all day! These songs have such feeling to them.  \\"New Shoes\\" was the reason why I bought it, just because it's fun and I have a shameless shoe addiction, but the other less upbeat melodies such as \\"Last Request\\" and \\"Loving You\\" keep me listening over and over.  Great CD!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Hello. My name is Tammy, and I am a soundtrack junkie.<br /><br />Other people may work to a background of smooth jazz or news talk. Not me. I'll put on one of my soundtrack playlists. But lately I haven't even had to do that...I just select this album, set the continuous play feature on iTunes and let it run for hours on end! The orchestration flows so beautifully from one track to the next it comes across as more of a suite than a collection of single tracks.<br /><br />Klaus Badelt has done an outstanding job. This is the best soundtrack I've come across since John Williams' Empire Strikes Back.
0807126063|5.0|I read this book again while visiting New Orleans having read it for the first time 4 or 5 years ago. Again, I laughed OUT LOUD. Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale, is a modern-day Don Quixote. He is too unique a character not to be thoroughly believed.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|This was hands down my favorite film of 2006. It was a somewhat long and gruesome wait to be able to finally watch it at home (even after having seen it twice in the theatres), and though the movie translates its somewhat depressing tone a little more fervently from the living room, it is still a study in the power of the trust and hope that human beings can have for one another. <br />Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps are nothing short of brilliant, with the former absolutely deserved of his nomination for his performance, and the latter unforgivably robbed of \\"best supporting\\" recognition at this year's Oscars. Also, kudos have to be given to the filmmakers for making perfect use of Broken Social Scene's music, which melds flawlessly with their respective scenes and the movie's tone in general. <br />Half Nelson is NOT a movie about one person's self-destructive spiral into drugs, but an unexpectedly quiet, personal, and nonviolent meditation on being able to wake up to another day, on being able to give yourself over to others who know better than to judge, on being able to help simply in the form of friendship. <br />Though it would have been nice to have a \\"behind the scenes\\" or making of feature for the film, it's still amusing to watch the deleted scenes and outtakes on the dvd. But I'm just perfectly fine with being able to turn this on whenever I want to!
B00005NTN5|5.0|If  Drama, suspence, a little humour and an impressive story line is your thing, then you are BOUND to like this movie.  Two  ladies ( sort of ) swindles the mob over two million dollars...drama unfolds from the begining throughout the movie keeping you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />P.S warning there is a little lesbian scene that deterred my mom from watching the whole movie ( however this was early in the film ).
B000M341QO|4.0|Excellent movie. Well done.  Movie flows well. Character flow is well developed.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|Ryan Gosling definitely deserves the recognition that he has gotten for this role. He is such a promising young actor and the directors have done a great job in creating an environment in which he explores the character. Shareeka Epps is also a good new find - it will be exciting to see what she does next.  Movie buffs and actors alike should definitley check this one out - one of the best simple indie films in awhile.  The ending is also refreshing as it gives the audience just enough information to infer the outcome of these characters without spelling anything out.  Good storytelling.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I have purchased this product twice now and it is the greatest thing for hanging flashlights in just those places you need one in emergencys. Next to the heater in the basement, in the kitchen pantry, near the garage door, bedroom closets, etc. No more need to try to find the one flashlight you forgot where you left it .. just hang one in each area. Fantastic product.
B000BCE918|5.0|I like the layout and the design of this DVD pack. I wish that the cover is T-Rex. Nevertheless, this is one of the greatest movie of all time!!!!! All Jurassic Park fan should purchase this item. THe amount of money you invest in this item is more economical than buying the three sets.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie is a wake up call to all. Really shows us how global warming is a serious concern for the future of our children and their future children. Watch this movie, support this movie. Very scary people are wasting there money on the dvd THE SECRET instead of buying this dvd.
B00005K3NR|5.0|I recently watched an episode of my favorite TV show, \\"Medium,\\" that paid homage to \\"Carrie\\" by having Aerial become prom queen of her middle school & having the bucket of blood rain down on her head.  Channel surfing, \\"Carrie\\" was also re-running on cable; so we rented the movie to see the entire film.<br /><br />In retrospect, I am struck by how much talk was at the last Oscars about how Martin Scorcese hadn't won an Oscar prior to his deserved recognition for \\"The Departed.\\"  Quite frankly, Brian DePalma has never even been NOMINATED for an Oscar.  With recent good films like \\"Black Dahlia\\" & \\"Femme Fetale\\" and classics like \\"The Untouchables,\\" \\"Scarface,\\" \\"Blow Out,\\" & \\"Dressed to Kill,\\" perhaps people should start talking about this other under-recognized director.  In his 1976 film \\"Carrie,\\" he builds the tension and mounts the rather simple story until its amazing climax at the prom with the house collapse at the end.  While this genre is rarely recognized critically, this is an example of one that was VERY well done.<br /><br />Based on Stephen King's first novel, this film is also memorable for being the first in a long line of cinema projects based on his work.<br /><br />The film is also memorable because it really placed Sissy Spacek's career before the public.  She had gotten good notices for the film \\"Badlands\\" with Martin Sheen as a serial killer three years earlier.  But \\"Carrie\\" paved the way for her Oscar-winning performance as Loretta Lynn in \\"Coal Miner's Daughter,\\" her Oscar nominations for \\"Crimes of the Heart\\" & \\"The River\\" as well as her Oscar nomination and Golden Globe win for \\"In the Bedroom.\\"  As Carrie, Spacek makes us totally believe how a young girl raised by this mother would be the shy retiring flower that we see.  The opening sequence where she has her first period and the girls cruelly make fun of her is hard to watch, but totally believable.<br /><br />Piper Laurie as her mother Margaret White entrances us as the tremendously unbalanced religious fanatic.  The scene where she blames Carrie for having her period and that it is evidence that she has sinned is so hard to watch.  Laurie was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for this film.  Along with a Best Actress nomination for \\"The Hustler\\" with Paul Newman in 1961 & a supporting nomination for \\"Children of a Lesser God\\" in 1986, \\"Carrie\\" represents the middle of her three nominations.  The final scene where she tries to sacrifice her daughter and Carrie telekinetically flings the kitchen knives across to kill her mother whose head tilts in a crucifixion-like pose takes your breath away.<br /><br />The film is also memorable for Betty Buckley's first film as the gym teacher Miss Collins.  Buckley had been a star of many Broadway musicals when she made this, her first feature that would be followed by \\"Tender Mercies.\\"  Nancy Allen plays the young socialite Chris Hargenson who hatches the plan to humiliate Carrie.  Allen would later marry director DePalma.  The film is also memorable because this marks the feature debut of Amy Irving.  As Sue Snell, her real-life mother Priscilla Pointer plays her character's mother in the film. Pointer would later be a regular on the \\"Dallas\\" TV series.<br /><br />The film is also memorable as John Travolta's second feature after a small part in another horror film \\"The Devil's Rain.\\"  Travolta followed this 1976 film with a string of hits from 1977 \\"Saturday Night Fever,\\" 1978 \\"Grease\\" and 1980 \\"Urban Cowboy.\\"  In 1981, Travolta re-teamed with Brian DePalma from what has always been one of my favorite suspense films, \\"Blow Out.\\"  Travolta later resurrected his career with Oscar nominated performances in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" (1994) & \\"Get Shorty\\" (1995), which also won him a Golden Globe award.  As Billy Nolan, Travolta is a happy-go-lucky guy who Nancy Allen leads around by his nose (or should we say pants).  The scene where he kills the pig to get its blood is freaky.<br /><br />William Katt played the blondcurled Tommy Ross who takes Carrie to the prom.  The son of Barbara Hale, known for playing Della Street on \\"Perry Mason,\\" in which Katt would later star, does a good job as the handsome athlete whose poem Carrie calls \\"beautiful.\\"<br /><br />\\"Carrie\\" came together very well with excellent cinematography and editing.  It is a classic in the horror genre, from which a TV remake has been done.  It remains a benchmark film.  The DVD package gives good added information and perspectives about the film.

B000GFLE86|5.0|WOW!  Purchased on a whim and really like it!  Reminds me of Nora Jones - but better.  Good to listen to while working, in the car, when company is at the house.

B000O174CM|5.0|I loved this movie, I felt it really portrayed life in the time trying to make it in the music industry. Jennifer Hudson really knocked my socks off with her rendition of \\"I'm not going\\" I never heard Jennifer Holiday's version, from what I hear was pretty amazing. But, I felt Bill Condon did a superb job. I congradulate Jennifer Hudson on her Oscar, she so deserved it. I watched her all through American Idol, wishing she had made the finals. But, her not winning American Idol was a blessing in disguise, afterall she wouldn't have had time to do Dreamgirls.My hat goes off to her and the entire cast. I am sooooo excited about the studio releasing it May 1st! My friends and I are going to have a Dreamgirls party. Now what is next....I believe they should make a movie of the hit broadway musical...Wicked!
B000BNTM96|4.0|Being an avid fan of QOTSA I was rather excited to listen to this album and watch the DVD because of the great track listing. Overall everything is awesome, with one exception, I have a really hard time enjoying it only because Joey Castillo is going at a little bit of a faster tempo than the songs originally should be at, to me it's very noticeable and it drive me nuts! I just want to yell at him sloooow down a little and it will be perfect. That is the only reason why I did not give it five stars. Other than that this set is awesome, great DVD to watch with lots of great extras and great cameo's as well. And the album is a great summer album, makes you wanna be gettin with the love! Oh one more thing...Nick Oliveri needs to be back in the band again, that guy is SICK(Sick as in really really good)!!!

B00009ATIX|1.0|Solaris is a movie that moves so slowly, it is often near the point of rigor mortis.  It is a dumbed down version of the original Soviet movie.  It is proof that sometimes American movies can be far inferior to Communist flicks. <br /> <br />George Clooney continually has this look on his face like he's wondering just how did he let his agent talk him into this film.

B000EMGAOY|4.0|It has taken quite some time for \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" to really grow on me, but almost a year later I have found myself listening to it daily for almost a month. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were always a band that functioned for me with a sense of immediacy, and this two CD set didn't grab me by the throat the way, for instance, \\"Californication\\" did. I had a few songs that I instantly dug, like the near hippy-vibe of \\"Dani California\\" and the 80's nod of \\"Make You Feel Better.\\"<br /><br />But after that, I found my attention meandering. While the band is tighter than ever, they have also become more mature. Anthony has given up the staccato rap delivery for the most part to sing, as he grooves eloquent on \\"Dani\\" or \\"Animal Bar.\\" A song that sounds like a watered down version of their old selves (\\"Hump de Bump\\") tuned me out, but I could find myself getting lured back in by \\"Desecration Smile.\\" Then the little things start to stick. The CD is really a showcase of John Frusciate's guitar chops...and on songs like \\"Readymade\\" he lets rip with great lead after great lead. He's letting his inner-Hendrix loose all across both 'planets' of \\"Stadium Arcadium.\\"<br /><br />As usual, the rest of his mates back him solid. Flea remains a powerhouse, and Chad Smith gives him the backbone to lay his unique style of bass against. Even on the mellow stuff (\\"Dani California\\") or the psychedelic \\"if,\\" Flea is proof that your bassist can make your band. And even if he isn't a member, special kudos go again to producer Rick Rubin, who once again catches the feel of the Peppers perfectly.<br /><br />While my personal preference goes to the \\"Mars\\" half of \\"Stadium Arcadium,\\" you may find yourself as I have. Lured into the entire set by the sticky, tasty morsels embedded into the songs just waiting to leap out and snare you, \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" may just be the Red Hot Chili Peppers equal to Smashing Pumpkins epic \\"Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness.\\" And like most everything else Rick Rubin put his fingers on during the year, one of 2006's best.ick Rubin put his fingers on during the year, one of 2006's best.
B000002H5I|5.0|A grand album, with extreme talent, great hooks, clear intent and purpose. Tracy Chapman's musical talent shines through on every track, from the rockin socially conscious \\"Talking about a revolution\\" to the reflective \\"Fast Car.\\" It was hearing the track 'Fast Car' that motivated me to turn around, drive to the music store, & buy this disc, when it was first released on album and cassette tape.(way back when) I was blown away. Well, I found the tape in my basement, recently, and popped it in. (I still play tapes) I was reminded of what a rockin' talented musician and writer Tracy Chapman is. Buy it, you'll like it. Strong, positive, honest and pure music that jams. Goes well with fighting global warming, too. Thanks Tracy.

0316172324|4.0|BLINK: THE POWER OF THINKING WITHOUT THINKING was a very interesting, quick read, that made me think of other books I've read recently on cognition, knowledge and decisionmaking, such as The Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowiecki (another New Yorker writer), The Logic of Failure by Dietrich Dorner and The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker (whom Gladwell references in this work). This book is about how we know what we know, how we decide when to act on that knowledge, and how our other emotional needs  and underlying associations enter into our process to disrupt it. Gladwell writes about his premise linearly, developing his ideas and enriching the concepts as he goes along with rich examples from sports, pop culture, healthcare and psychological research. It was a fascinating and educational read.<br /><br />The subject of BLINK is that the human mind is capable of quick, decisive, correct thinking -- we can know things in the blink of an eye. Gladwell's introduction focuses on the Getty Museum's purchase of a kouros that turned out to be a fake. All the Getty's tests confirmed that the kouros, though very rare, was authentic, but when outside art experts saw it for the first time, they knew instantly that it wasn't at all authentic. How did they know? Some of them couldn't articulate this...they just knew that it was wrong.<br /><br />Gladwell states that this ability is founded on \\"thin slicing\\" -- the ability to separate necessary information for decisionmaking from \\"noise.\\" Gladwell then explores the \\"locked door\\" -- the premise that a great deal of our \\"thinking without thinking\\" goes on in our subconscious, and try as we might, we cannot understand how we know what we know. In this chapter, Gladwell explores psychological testing of human subjects with \\"priming\\" -- planting certain words in subjects minds and then watching how they behave in social situations (like planting polite words and observing heightened polite behavior or, conversely, aggressive words and aggressive behavior).<br /><br />In further discussion of subconscious influences on conscious decisionmaking, Gladwell uses the Warren G. Harding case as an example of cultural preferences for certain traits -- preferences that are rooted in the subconscious, of which we aren't even aware. In this discussion, Gladwell uses the Implicit Association Test research at Harvard (a fascinating experience...you can take your own at: https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/demo/) that measures the degree to which one holds preferences for thin or young people, or relates images of weapons to black men or science and math careers to men. This is cogent to the discussion of quick decisionmaking because these views may be predictive of how we may act in certain kinds of spontaneous situations.<br /><br />The subject of spontaneity leads to a fascinating chapter on a large war game, the Millenium Challenge, and the two approaches taken by its combatting leaders. The Blue Team used copious amounts of data, slicing and dicing. The Red Team, didn't believe that the fog of war could be lifted and went into battle giving a great deal of control and autonomy to lower-level soldiers and commanders. The Red Team won (until Blue changed the rules and started again!). Gladwell uses this example as a way to illustrate the damage too much information can do. A discussion of expertise follows in which Gladwell points out that experts snap judgments are different from the rest of the population's quick impressions because they are more informed. And this is, to me, the nut of the whole book. Blink thinking works best for those who have a basis of knowledge on a topic (such as the art experts' views of the fake kouros) because whether their decisions come from behind the locked door or not, they are informed by years of knowledge acquistion. They are often better able, as well, to understand some of the key aspects of their responses. The penultimate chapter is about the Amadou Diallo case in the Bronx, in which four police officers fired 41 rounds at an unarmed black man standing on his stoop after midnight. Gladwell's dissection of the case is fascinating and enlightening, as he takes the position that the police were neither racist nor blameless. Due to two aspects of the situation that makes people \\"mind blind\\" -- increased situational \\"arousal\\" and lack of time or \\"white space\\" to assess the situation, the officers acted out of their basest instincts because the situation (of their own making) reduced their ability to \\"read the mind\\" of Diallo. The final chapter includes an example of how our first impressions can be misshaped by other information that isn't exactly relevant, women earning positions in symphony orchestras by playing anonymously behind screens.<br /><br />Gladwell's work is so readable and fascinating and is a great reference for work, home and group decisionmaking because it explains our intuitive knowledge, when it functions best and when it misfires. I STRONGLY recommend this book!case in the Bronx, in which four police officers fired 41 rounds at an unarmed black man standing on his stoop after midnight.

B000MGUZM0|5.0|Generally speaking, whenever I anticipate an album's release, I'm usually let down.  Not the case with Neon Bible.  It's not exactly the same as Funeral, but it's just as good- with that same energy and raw honesty that makes this band so appealing.
0743496728|5.0|I am the parent of two teenagers...and when I see the news of yet another school shooting, in an otherwise 'affluent' or peaceful town, I am shocked and horrified. Yet, reading Jodi Picoult's latest novel, I could feel that it *could* happen here. It also makes me count my blessings that it hasn't. <br /> <br />This novel shows not only the horror of a school shooting, but the years leading up to it, the way many students view themselves as outcasts (despite apparent popularity for some) and the fragility of teen culture. At the same time, it is well told, well written novel. It's a fast paced page turner that the reader will be unable to put down. You have great empathy for all of the characters, at one time or another, when you least expect to.  <br /> <br />This is a story without good guys and bad guys, but in which the good and bad are the same people. I highly recommend it.

B000MV9026|5.0|This movie was extremely funny!!. There were a lot of adult humor, but they do that in a lot of movies so the adults dont get bored watchin it. I think that the whole propaganda is a stretch too far. The thing with the aliens (humans) was a good part of the plot. THe other penguins thought because he was different he was causing the food to go away. I think that people take these movies a little bit too seriously, its just a movie. And i think this was a great cartoon movie/comedy. And the tapping was amazing!!!!!!!!

B000LE0THO|4.0|an excellent album of rock/pop music with classical overtones. the group's leader, jeff lynne, is an extremely talented individual with an extraordinary sense for fine pop melodies. the classical overtones are more mozart, than say, stravinsky or mahler. the orchestra is always moving forward, elegantly, to a satisfying resolution on each song. the songs themselves are almost all fine, but my one gripe would be that this was a two record set, thus a looong cd, and the tempos of the songs are all fairly similar (upbeat, but not really hard rocking), thus towards the end it does seem that some editing could have been used, and the whole thing made just a tad shorter. small complaint though. i highly recomment this album. wonderful stuff. <br />

B0000029DD|4.0|jeff buckley's father, tim buckley, was one of the great folk/rock artists of the late sixties/early seventies. jeff, like dad, had talent to burn, know doubt about it. three tracks on this album are classics: the stunning \\"hallelujah,\\" the equally stunning \\"lover, you should've come over,\\" and the string-laden rocker \\"eternal life.\\" these three tracks hint at what could have come had this artist not tragically died at such a young age. so much potential. i give this album 4 stars because i believe that, though a fantastic album you should definitely have, this is not a 5 star classic. it is fine through and through, but mostly suggests the huge potential jeff buckley had. if you have never heard his father's music, i highly recommend \\"happy sad,\\" and \\"blue afternoon,\\" both bona fide classics from 1969.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|This film needed actual monsters and more fighting. I am not normally one to ask for action. I love character study films. However, when there is neither character study nor action nor motivation, a film drowns in its lostness. I was saddened that the writers got their history wrong. Most scholars believe that Beowulf's tale actually traces back to at least 200 BC. So, the cliche monk would not even exist in the original telling. The worst part of the film was that the characters all had different accents. This film is an incorrect account of Beowulf.

B000MNP2KI|2.0|Meet the newest double 0 agent.  British intelligence agency MI6 assigns this designation to their premier agents who have made two kills in the line of duty.  And James Bond (Daniel Craig) has just made that designation.<br /><br />His first assignment is to find a bomb maker and use him to track the terrorists ultimately responsible.  While he wants the man alive, the situation turns deadly, and Bond is lucky to get out with his life.  He does manage to get one clue, the word \\"Ellipse\\" and the phone number the text message came from.  The trail leads him first to the Bahamas, then Miami.<br /><br />Behind the scenes is Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelson).  He's a banker to terrorists the world over.  When Bond interferes with his original plan, Le Chiffre finds himself in major debt.  To earn the money to pay off his bills, he sets up a very high stakes poker game at the famous Casino Royale.  MI6 sends Bond to play.  Will poker be the end of Le Chiffre and his funding of terrorism?<br /><br />The movie starts well with a couple of clever action sequences that had me entertained.  I was hoping that the rest of the movie would be that good.  Then the second half hits, and the movie slows way down.  The poker scenes dragged, even for someone with an interest in poker.  And the action scenes the interrupt the poker are boring, too.  And the story slows to let us wonder if Bond will be okay.  Frankly, I just wanted to know how he'd be okay.<br /><br />But wait, we aren't done yet.  The movie keeps going after what appears to be the climax.  As each scene drew to a close, I thought the movie might be ending, but it just kept going.  And, in trying to add a twist or two, the story get almost impossible to follow.<br /><br />This is a shame since the movie has some good performances.  Daniel Craig is great as Bond.  And Judi Dench is funny as Bond's boss, \\"M.\\"  Eva Green adds some laughs as an accountant assigned to work with Bond.  The two have some wonderful scenes together with easily the funniest lines of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is two and a half hours long.  Thirty minutes could have easily been cut to make this a much better movie.  Unless you are already a Bond fan, stir clear of this loser.together with easily the funniest lines of the movie.  <br /> <br />The movie is two and a half hours long.

B000F8O4E0|4.0|elo doesn't get much respect from the prog-rock crowd as far as i can tell. that's too bad, because there is a lot of great music on this album that i would call classic prog-rock. this recording is not as commercial sounding as there later albums, and has more variety of sound overall. it opens with \\"fire on high,\\" a stunning prop-rock instrumental, then moves into a gorgeous mid-tempo song \\"waterfall.\\" this, and two other mid-tempo tunes: the hit \\"strange magic,\\" and \\"one summer dream,\\" are, to me, the best stuff on the album. \\"poker,\\" is a fine rocker, and \\"down home town,\\" sounds like a fine lost ringo starr track. fantastic album overall, and the remastering has a wonderful sound.
B000KCHZK6|3.0|The latest CD from Norah Jones is good background music, but there aren't many song that make you turn up the volume to listen to.  I love her voice and phrasing as always, but there is little variation in the tempo or dynamics, so the songs tend to blend together.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I went into the theatre not expecting much. The local radio station joked about it and my friends agreed, but I walked away compelled to write this.. so that has to mean something. Honestly, I think those who found this in poor taste probably never thought much of the first Rocky.  <br /> <br />In the end this movie had little to do with fighting and much more to do with his life outside the ring...to pursue and prove his own existence. It sounds too sentimental, but Rocky manages to strike a balance surprisingly well. Its a good take home message, specially during these volatile times, when human spirit seems to be defined by our foes and enemies, Rocky manages to convince us that it is more about the struggle within ourselves.   <br /> <br />Its a very fitting finale, and Im quite astonished, Sylvester Stallone pulled it off. Even up until the end where he walks out of the ring before the fight is even called, there is much to admire. This movie had more heart than many of the critically acclaimed boxing movies Ive seen of recent times.  <br /> <br />I only found fault in the fight itself. It ended well, but the choreography was poorly executed. In line with the credibility of the story, they should have taken out most of the 10 dozen career ending haymakers. Rocky seemed absolutely clueless to the blocking technique. <br /> <br />This movie could have been a disaster, but instead much like the story goes, can walk away with its head up high.   <br />
1582701709|2.0|I found the book to be extremely over simplistic and tedious to read. It repeats the basic message in every page.  If you want to read better work to grow as a person, read anything written by Mariane Williamson or attend any of the courses offered by landmark education. This book is kinder garden. However, I am happy that sales of this book are is doing well since this book is a good starting point for people who have never done any self-improvement work or reading.<br /><br />I wonder why Oprah did not push Marianne Williamson's work instead since she is one of her friends at XM radio.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|I have never previously been moved to write a review for Amazon, but I have to let anybody who's interested know that this is the best \\"Rock\\" album of the last 10 years at least (maybe one of the 5 best of all time). <br /> <br />Muse are, quite simply, brilliant.  I cannot think of any other band that so cleverly synthesises influences ranging from Rachmaninov to Rage Against the Machine (with a healthy dose of '70's prog along the way)to produce a sound that is definitely rock music, familiar sounding and yet quite unlike anything else.  Just listen to \\"Space Dementia\\" and then try to think of anything you've ever heard like it.  Amazing. <br /> <br />While I started with their latest (and probably most accessible) album \\"Black holes and Revelations\\" and worked back to \\"Origins\\", I have to say that, while I love Black Holes, Origins is their masterpiece.  The only other achievement that comes close is \\"OK Computer\\", but even that has it's patchy moments, and definitely sounds underproduced compared to Origins.  However, it's wrong to compare Muse to Radiohead in any other way, as Muse can run circles around them musically and lyrically - And before I heard Muse I thought Tom Yorke was a minor God... <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor - Run, don't walk, to get this album and listen to it about 10 times straight through on headphones.  I promise you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />

1582701709|5.0|i believe the secret is in every one if they gi get it great book,
B000000OQF|5.0|Yep, that's a pretty strong statement, but it's true.  When Guns N' Roses released \\"Appetite For Destruction,\\" they unleashed one of the greatest albums of all time.  Every single song on this album is a classic.  It's a fusion of hard rock, punk, blues, and straight-up heavy metal.  It's one of the few albums that got everything right.  There's absolutely no filler.  Axl and company managed to make an album that reflected its demographic to perfection.  The entire album is about living at full speed and often slipping off of the tracks.  Songs like \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" show just how bad things can be for an addict.  \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" reflects how quickly one can get tangled into drugs.  Heck, even the token ballad, \\"Sweet Child O'Mine,\\" rocks and it has one of the greatest openings of any song in rock history in my opinion.  Other highlights include the wonderful \\"Paradise City,\\" \\"Rocket Queen,\\" and the wonderfully raunchy \\"Anything Goes.\\"<br /><br />If you consider yourself a rock authority, you must have this album.  It's a definite classic and the pinnacle of hard rock during the last two decades.<br /><br />Of course, if you're around my age (thirty), this album also serves as a wonderful flashback.  I remember that my parents wouldn't let me get this album due to the \\"F\\" word that is used loosely and frequently throughout.  Not to be hindered in my desire to own it, I had one of my buddies get it for me through one of the CD/Cassette clubs back then.  I hid and cherished my copy and still own my original cassette.  I've long since upgraded to the CD, but I still have a softspot for that old tape.  (Sorry folks, just an oldster remembering the past.)<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000EDWL82|5.0|Why buy \\"The Back Room\\" ? <br />In these days where music is sold song by song (when it is actually sold), it is always a pleasure to have an album where the whole is a coherent collection of good music, and \\"The Back Room\\" is such an album. <br />As a Joy Division and Interpol fan, it's a given that I'd like the sound, but the variety in the tracks is a good surprise. <br />\\"Lights\\" open very powerfully, and \\"Munich\\" (my favourite, with also a great video that can be watched at the band's website) comes in sequence to keep you on your toes, followed by \\"Blood\\", a great song but one that exposes them to some critics over the lack of work in the lyrics ... generally they have great verses but sometimes they repeat them too much. <br />Then they mix tempos and moods with \\"Fall\\", \\"All Sparks\\" (great video also), \\"Camera\\" and \\"Fingers in the Factories\\" (another favourite). <br />They proceed to close the album with a good sequence (\\"Open Your Arms\\" has a strong finish). <br />Overall, a very strong debut album, and although there might be something still to work on, it's definitely worth buying as a CD; I'll be awaiting eagerly their second album.

158799190X|5.0|Why buy \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" ?    It is a book that was not written causally; the autor not only \\"talks the talk\\", but \\"walks the walk\\" (on both personal and profissional levels).  Although a significant number of traders and other finance professionals read this book, it is not a finance book (\\"Dynamic Hedging\\" is such a book), it is a book about how people attribute causes to events that were shaped by dynamics that cannot be described without taking into account the role of chance.    Because finance presents such a variety of spetacular successes and failures, (and as Mandelbrot said to the author, \\"data, a goldmine of data\\"), it is a field ripe for the study of the role that chance can play on the outcomes of lives and careers.    The characters that you meet through the book (Nero Tulip, Carlos, John) help to make the point that one cannot become lazy and trust life to beave as it should, but that we must make an effort to become aware that we're prone to make evaluation mistakes; after all, we're wired to find patterns quickly, not to know everything.    This book should be read, because it'll impact you (due to both style and ideas); after reading it, think about it, debate it, go back and read it again, but by no means reduce it to a critic of successful people or particular traders, or to phrases like \\"everything is random\\". This is not what the book is about.    What it is about ?    How our judgement is sometimes wrong, why it is wrong, and how the author has been dealing with the effort of overriding it. It is worthwhile.    Because it has attracted a lot of attention, much has been written about the book and the author. I think the best way to have an oppinion on this book is by reading it, which is what I did. To have an oppinion about the author, the best way is to check his website ([...]).    In my personal opinion, it is a very well written book, with good insights and as relevant today (2007) as when it was first published (2001).
B000EULJLU|3.0|I'm glad I read the review by \\"andreaabs\\".  I had never really gotten into Tool and never owned (or listened to an entire CD before).  I'm more into old school metal  (Megadeth, Metallica, judas Priest, etc).  I heard some samplings on the radio and thought I'd invest in the 10,000 days CD.  \\"Vicarious\\" rocks and I listened to it over and over.  Most of the rest of the CD is kind of drab for someone with hard hitting tastes like mine.  After reading andreaabs' review, I will be tempted to check out some of their earlier stuff.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Great, great classic movie, but frankly, the full length version of When Love is Gone featured in the uncut version doesn't really fit the spirit of the rest of the movie.   <br /> <br />Otherwise, this is definitely a keeper!
B000FVGMC4|5.0|I am always on the lookout for up and coming new singer songwriters to add to my collection so when I heard New Shoes on a Paste Magazine CD I knew Paolo Nutini was the perfect addition. For me, I can tell how good a CD is by how long it stays in my car's CD player. I have a long commute and no CD changer so I listen to the same CD over and over until I get tired of it. A mediocre CD is lucky to last a week. These Streets lasted over 2 months and when it was replaced it was immediately put on my MP3 player for at-work listening. Every song is a gem with some that sparkle just a tad more. My favorites are These Streets, a song about moving to an unfamiliar place, and Autumn, a beautiful and moving tribute to his late grandfather. Of course New Shoes is one of the best with catchy lyrics that you can't help but sing along with at the top of your lungs...well I can't anyhow ;) <br />All in all this is a great addition to any CD collection.

B000092T6M|5.0|I have to agree with the other positive reviews of the Two-Disc special extended edition.  I do want to respond to one reviewer who said that key scenes were cut from the original... I'm not sure about the other scenes referred to, but I am currently watching the movie, and I can definitly say the scene where Robin cuts the Sheriff's cheek is in the extended version.  It is very fast... the cutting sequence is probably less than 1/2 second so you have to be watching for it... but it is there.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The style in which this film was shot in is beautiful.  Ed Norton gives an extraordinary performance as an illusionist torn between his work and his love for an untouchable member of society.  The story is filled with love, trickery, and murder.  A great film.
159562015X|1.0|What a disappointment. This book contains two parts, Part 1 and Part 2. <br />Part 1 gives you 30 pages on the background of strengths.It does very little delving into the science behind the work like the first book. <br />Part 2 is a description of the Strengths themes. Unlike the first book where you have a section on describing the strengths and a section that discusses managing someone with the strength (which is very detailed and helpful for managers)this book reduces discussion on managing others with their strengths to a few bullet points. <br />The first book has THREE sections instead of two and a full seven chapters compared to 2.0's two sections without chapters. In the first book the first chapter gives you the background on strengths, the second chapter describes how to build your strengths, the third chapter discusses the strengths assessment instrument, the fourth chapter goes deep on the 34 strength themes,the fifth chapter goes into commonly asked questions about strengths,  the sixth chapter discusses managing people by their strengths and the seventh chapter discusses building a strengths based organization. <br />The first book has over 247 pages that are nearly twice the size of the 174 pages of 2.0 which has much smaller pages as it is more of a handbook size than a traditional book size. <br />Please don't shell out your cash for this Cliff Note version of the real thing!
B00005JPCF|5.0|This is a great take on Penguins with talent.  The animation is beautiful and the story is funny.  Yeah some real life subjects are the under current in this movie but just let the kids enjoy it.  Great movie with memorable characters.
0790749815|5.0|Right next to The Birds, I would rate this as one of Alfred Hitchcock's best thrillers! Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are superb in their talented roles of the wrong man at the wrong time. From New York, to Chicago, to Indiana to Mt. Rushmore,it is over two hours of great suspense and scenery. By the way if you live and encounter a crop dusting plane be careful! You will be on the edge of your seat with this classic!
B00081U7HC|5.0|This 15th Anniversary edition has some deleted scenes inserted into the movie that has had some \\"purists\\" howling, but for me, I think it adds a new dimension to the relationship between Edward and Vivian.  Aside from that the commentary from Garry Marshall was fun (of course, hearing from Julia Roberts and Richard Gere would have been great, but whatever).  The wrap party is a joke; they shouldn't have bothered inserting that. The \\"Pretty Woman Tour\\" which takes you to the actual places where the movie was filmed was also informative.  But all that aside, it's about the movie and it is a movie that still seems fresh and original all these years later.  It's well worth owning because this a is a movie that will surely get more than one viewing.
B000784WMW|5.0|I am a reader, not a movie critic.  So if you want to know if this is  a 'good movie', read the other reviews.  But if you're like me, wanting to know if a movie based on a story is actually based on the story, this is it!  Not once in the entire 5 hours (or however long it is) did I get upset because the movie makers got the story wrong or tried to modernize  Ms. Bronte's eloquent depiction of characters and 19th century attitudes.  Instead, several times I found myself saying, \\"This is exactly the way it is in the book!\\"
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I am a huge Jane Eyre fan! By far it is one of my favorite books of all times and I also have 4 versions of it on DVD. This addaptation of it on film is my favorite.   <br /> <br />The Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke version has a bit of a better screenplay, because it is closer to the book, but this one does go into better detail than the A&E screenplay.  The chemistry of Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson as Rochester and Jane is true to the passion that Bronte wrote and it ignites on screen better than any of the other couples before them.  <br /> <br />Toby Stephens take on Rochester is much more appealing than Ciaran Hinds-- he was too rough; much more mercurial than William Hurt's version-- essential to the Rochester character; and not as melodramatic as Timothy Dalton's interpretation.  Dalton by the way was much too handsome for the role-- twice it mentions that Rochester was not handsome or and was hideous-- Dalton's dashing looks did not help with the character.  Stephens has that weather beaten look and was gruff but appealing enough to make him a belivable and fascinating Rochester; he also gave Rochester a manly vulnerability about him that can make you see why an independant Jane Eyre would fall in love with him.  <br /> <br />Ruth Wilson was wonderful as Jane!  She gave the character enough sass, intelligence and innocence that rivaled all the Jane Eyres before her.  Again you can see how Rochester can fall in love with Jane, despite her small, little and plain looks. Incidentally, there are moments in the movie, specifically when Jane begins to fall in love with Rochester, when you can see such physical beauty-- the beauty of a woman in love.  The director did an amazing job capturing this.  <br /> <br />If you are as Jane Eyre fan, a Bronte fan, a Jane Austen fan, a period film fan, a romantic, a cynic-- this is the one for you.  ENJOY!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Although there aren't too many surprises in the plot of this movie, it is still one of the best romantic comedies that I have seen in a long, long time. It is a wonderfully well written story with great character development.  During the movie I fell in love with each of the five major characters.  I loved this movie!  Tomorrow I am going to watch it again with commentary, which I NEVER do!
0393327655|3.0|I found myself breezing through this book, enjoying some parts, while honestly not absorbing much of the book by the end, hence the three stars.  Particularly strong are the dissections of the political correctness of many liberals (whom I count myself as one of them) on religion.  Long ago, at the age of 13, I realized that god-belief was an improbable proposition and became an atheist.  As a result, the strong points of the book were the parts that went beyond the common knowledge and expanded the belief systems of well versed atheists/humanists.  These come with the aforementioned discussion of liberals, the particularly dangerous beliefs of the religion of Islam and a breakdown of some ethical barriers (with the discussion of torture versus collateral damage).
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This is a quintessential Neil Young acoustic concert.  It is a must for all fans and music lovers.  Great songs from the late sixties and early seventies.
0618680004|4.0|I quite enjoyed this book as a discussion of the large improbability of a god, a dissection of current arguments, an analysis of the dangers that religion poses and a scant discussion of a new area of research on the evolutionary origins of religion.  This last part seemed sort of underanalyzed, especially since Dawkins' previous cogent discussions of evolution have been so enlightening.  Perhaps the research in this area is not that complete but Dawkins wanted to mention it nonetheless.  Unfortunately I read this book shortly after reading 'The Selfish Gene' and 'The Blind Watchmaker' both by Richard Dawkins.  These books were pretty amazing and awe-inspiring discussions of important topics.  Reading the god delusion I couldn't help but get bored at times, not because of the writing but simply because I felt that I was wasting my time on something that I had realized when I was 13.
B000MNP2K8|3.0|I've been a big 007 fan since the first ones in the 60's. Sean Connery, Roger Moore, etc, set the standard for the character. Even though this film was one the good ones the new Bond (Daniel Criag) just looks like he should be the super spy Bond would fight, he really looks too German, like one of the kids from Hiltler's specially breeding programs. The guys looks spoiled the whole movie for me, how can you accept him as Bond when he's unacceptable as English.
0393061310|5.0|I was surprised to find this book an instant page-turner.  Who would have thought that a very thick book full of historical and biological details would be such a fast read.  Much of this stems from the fact that this book is interesting on many levels.  For an analysis of human history it is quite thorough, for a discussion of our natural history it is enlightening and for providing the intellectual framework for an analysis of inequality it is the first of its kind.  Lovers of history, evolution, archaeology, biology, anthropology and botany will all find delight in this book.  A must read!!!
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Wow! A politician who really believes what he says! It's what we call in the industry \\"someone who believes his own press\\". The unfortunate reality here is that the mock-u-mentary's real title should have been \\"An Incomplete Truth\\" due to the \\"fact\\" that 1) Science is NOT a consensus issue as Mr. Gore has purported, and 2) The BBC has recently aired a much more fair depiction of what Mr. Gore has overtly politicized.<br /><br />Only 30 years ago the environmentalist movement worldwide was warning of the \\"coming Ice Age\\". Oops. Bad prediction based on bad politics. That is, politics based on its agenda that required propoganda over true facts. Now they are predicting the extreme OPPOSITE: global warming!!!<br /><br />There was a day in which we had learned NOT to blindly trust our politicians. Now it seems like college students and most people who worship at the altar of Hollywood and the Democrat Party refuse to admit that they've lost the ability to discriminate. That is, if they even know what the true meaning of that word means. Like the children of the Pied Piper, they simply walk off the cliff of \\"if I saw it on T.V., it must be true\\". Access Hollywood, The View, The Tonight Show, all have cheerleaders pushing one agenda and afraid...no, unable to entertain another view lest it weaken their political elitism...\\"we know better than the average guy, so he better do as we tell him\\".<br /><br />Don't forget the \\"not as I do\\" as in the case of Mr. Gore's whopping energy use - and his weak attempt at justifying his usage by \\"buying carbon footprints\\" which amount to little more than a bunch of trees that will require 20 years of growth to compensate for 1 month of his power usage). Sheesh! Mr. Gore, your hypocracy is killing us and making your acceptance of accolades for this film a bit embarrasing for you. We're not all puppets. But I guess there's enough of 'em out there to keep you feelin' good about yourself and in the public spotlight...for better or for worse.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: Mr. Gore, I respect your work in government (I think), but why do you still refuse (as of March 2007) to have your claims discussed with those scientists and researchers who differ with you? That's what makes this movie's claims appear so weak. Does anyone know why \\"tempered steel\\" can withstand so much pressure? Because it has withstood the heat.<br /><br />Sorry, maybe this is a bit over the heads of his fans, but I would only ask that those who read this have an open mind and don't just believe everything the politician tells you. You'll be better off for it...and a bit more intelligent! Most of his followers hate it when moral leaders talk about \\"truth\\", but fall lock-stock-and-barrel for Al and his \\"truth\\".<br /><br />\\"1 Star\\" for lack of honesty disguised as \\"Truth\\".Mr. Gore, I respect your work in government (I think), but why do you still refuse (as of March 2007) to have your claims discussed with those scientists and researchers who differ with you?

1400031362|4.0|The adventures of Mma Ramotswe, the strong, feisty, proud but compassionate lady detective (the only in Botswana, maybe Africa) continue in MORALITY FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, the third novel of the No.1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY series.  Things are not going too well for Mma Ramotswe - the agency is facing money problems, and her fiance, the kind and up-till-now ever reliable Mr. JLB Matekoni starts behaving very strangely and looses all interest in everything, including his passion, being a mechanic at his business Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors.<br /><br />While Mma Ramotswe is juggling these personal problems, she is yanked into solving the complex case of an Arrogant Government Man who fears that his greedy sister-in-law wants to poison his brother for money.  How much can one lady detective handle?<br /><br />Helping save the day is Mma Ramotswe's former personal secretary, now promoted to Assistant Detective, Mma Makutsi.  Mma Makutsi, who is 'too dark,' has glasses that are 'too big', and whose hair just is never 'quite right' really comes into her own in this novel - she becomes 'Assistant Manager' of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, whipping it into shape with the force of her personality so that its in a much better condition than even when Mr. JLB Matekoni ran it.<br /><br />She also continues her duties as Assistant Detective, ably proving herself as she handily solves a case of determining which finalist in 'the Beauty and Integrity contest' actually has integrity- and thereby receives big bucks which keep the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency afloat.<br /><br />Like its predecessors, this book is not your typical \\"who dun it\\" detective story.  As Mma Ramotswe flatly tells the Government Man, \\"We help people with the problems in their lives.  We are not here to solve crimes.\\"<br /><br />Along with helping people with the problems in their lives, Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi continue in this book to have hilarious but often wise insights about gender, beauty, marriage, weight, criminology, treatment of elders and servants, cows, and a number of other topics, all highlighted by the ever-wise old Botswana Morality.uty, marriage, weight, criminology, treatment of elders and servants, cows, and a number of other topics, all highlighted by the ever-wise old Botswana Morality.   <br /> <br />
1582701709|1.0|the only \\"secret\\" is that there is no secret. this book is a marketing ploy-plain and simple. do not contribute to the author's bank account, save your money, and, work hard and honestly for what you need- that's \\"THE SECRET\\". the book, the author, and her supporters say nothing new, nothing with originality, and, nothing that is truly proven. it is however, very nice kindling for my fire.
B000060OFT|4.0|Shakespeare dialogue with contemporary setting.  It is amazing how they combined recent backgrounds and backdrops to coincide with very, very old dialogue.  I liked especially how it ended, although we all know what happens, this movie showed a contemporary twist to a well-known tragic ending.  Leo and Claire - great performances.
B000JBWWRY|4.0|I love Peter Pan, and I was introduced to the story through this movie. I was glad to get this DVD, and the restoration is excellent. The Special Features are grand... except one. Disney, can YOU PLEASE QUIT RE-ARRANGING GOOD OLD SONGS FOR YOUR NEW ARTISTS? Seriously, \\"Second Star To The Right\\" is a magical song, but the new video by T-Squad is anything but. (By the way, same thing with the Ashley Tisdale performance of \\"Kiss The Girl\\" on the new DVD of THE LITTLE MERMAID.) Because of this, I dropped a star out of 5. <br /> <br />The picture is pristine and clear all throughout. The colors are just perfect. The sound is crisp and clear. Disney, you did a wonderful job restoring this picture. <br /> <br />If you love this movie, buy this DVD. <br /> <br />Oh, and there's a trailer for a supposed re-release of \\"Return to Neverland\\" on DVD. When's that going to happen, though?
B000EHRVP6|3.0|This movie didn't live up to hype it worked up,perhaps I exspected too much. Sure the acting was okay,even the story is somewhat realistic and it delivered some scares, so what went wrong? Even though I wanted alot more gore I still think the eye-scene was so badly made and it made me loose contact with the movie and that's never a good thing.I would pick CABIN FEVER above this movie anyday... <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004Y6NW|2.0|Bought it when I was 10 because I liked Sultans of Swing. Hated the rest of it. Well, I was 10; it was adult music. Got rid of it.  <br /> <br />Bought it again at 38 in a bargain bin. It hasn't improved for me. Dire Straits recorded half a dozen great songs over 7-8 years, but 'Sultans' is the only one on show here. There's nothing exactly wrong with the others - they're just not especially good songs when you measure them against thousands of others recorded over the last 50 years or so. They deserve a certain degree of respect; the rest is a question of taste.

B00004U45G|5.0|Zep had, hands down, the best and heaviest riffs in rock and roll history, all penned by one Jimmy Page.  The resurrected versions found on these discs are, if anything, even meaner and more massive after their long hibernation.  Listen to the sample of the Lemon Song.  It's like a soundtrack for the apocalypse.  It swings like a wrecking ball.  Makes Linkin Park sound a little whiny doesn't it? <br /> <br />OK, Page's solos aren't 100% on point, but he still gets 5 stars because any one of these riffs can eat entire other bands for breakfast.  Make sense?  OK, put it this way...Jimmy had to do a lot of drugs to be able to go to that strange, dark place where these riffs were living and drag them kicking and screaming back to the land of the living.  For that we will forgive him a few off notes here and there. <br /> <br /> <br />If you've got any testosterone, for God's sake, get this. <br />

B00003CWNR|3.0|Cider House Rules, the movie, gave us themes: abortion, responsibility, incest. It gave us cute orphans, and an ether-addicted benevolent doctor, and names and settings (and readings) that evoked Dickens. Perhaps those evocations made more sense in the book - they didn't seem to fit in the movie. <br /> <br />There were wonderful moments, to be sure. \\"Goodnight you princes of Maine, you kings of New England.\\" The cinematography was gorgeous, the banter between the apple pickers realistic, but the core of the matter - these themes - on the core the movie was conspicuously silent. Not silent in that it had nothing to say, but silent in that we've heard it all before. We weren't given any new ways to look at the abortion struggle, or the disgust of incest. Even on responsibility the film was, while not silent, disingenuous. <br /> <br />Also, nothing at all happened in the film that surprised me. I knew what was going to happen before it happened, and when events occurred that I hadn't anticipated, they were cloyingly organic and therefore neither surprising nor terribly moving. <br /> <br />Tobey McGuire, for all the money he's making now as Spider-Man, can't move his upper lip when he speaks, and so his delivery is always utterly devoid of emotion and his characters lack believability. Michael Caine and Kathy Bates were wonderful, both are extremely good actors. Perhaps the most believable, and sympathetic character, was Theron's - and the best acted. She bore one of the themes: responsibility. She has my vote for best actor in this picture. It's her performance that made this 3 stars for me.

0553582461|5.0|I have read the three books in this trilogy and without hesitation, I say that Hobbs' ability to take a story containing the ultimate in magical fantasy, including dragons, and make it feel as if it were reality.  At no time did I feel as if the story went too far in taking me, the reader, into realms that could not possibly exist. All the events in all three books were true to their characters and the setting where the action took place.<br /><br />What an amazing mind Hobbs has to create characters with flaws even as they take their place as heros. I loved this series and was disappointed to have it end. The entire atmosphere stayed with me long after I read the last page.

0743454537|4.0|This book made me think a lot. It focuses cheifly on a family that is in the throes of an impossible situation and a daughter with an absolutely impossible decision to make: Whether to lose herself or to lose something equally preciouss. <br /> <br />It focuses on so many good points. What is the value of one life against another? What does it mean to define yourself? Can we really protect anyone from anything, least of all our children? Are any of our relationships what we think they are? <br /> <br />This book made me wince, cry, and think for hours. The ending, though alarming, seems oddly appropriately ironic. I believe it's going to take many more days for me to figure out the answer to all these questions or even all the questions presented. <br /> <br />As for those who have not read it, by all means do. It's a wonderful way to pass away an afternoon, just don't try to read it while busy. <br />

B000MNP2KI|1.0|I didn't see it in the theater because the trailer didn't impress me. I read many a glowing review of this film and thought perhaps it would be worth my time. Every James Bond film that Pierce Brosnan was involved with was crap, so I was extremely skeptical. Well, this...reinvention of the series...is no different. It's not Daniel Craig's fault though. He has potential, if they would give him a character to play instead of a cardboard cut-out. I could tell from the very first moments of this film that it sucked, and it never got any better. Did the whole world suddenly accept B-movies as the standard? Martin Campbell has never directed a good movie in his life and this is no exception. Why let him on? He sucks! He ruined a good script! Who thought he could do it in the first place?! <br />As far as I'm concerned, this is no James Bond movie. It feels more like one of those opening skits of an MTV movie awards, but instead of trying to be humorous, it is without trying. I feel sorry for anyone who thinks this is good. It's far from it. Ian Fleming would be pissed. <br />
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I bought and enjoyed John's first album; this new one I like more. While his voice and sound remains the same the style has changed a bit on a few tracks and I really liked the variety. Gravity is by far my favorite.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|After the mild disappointment of Rocky V this sixth installment is the dignified ending to the series that fans were previously deprived of. Stallone does a great job of reminding us all just how talented he is as a writer, director and actor. A masterfully understated performance much more in keeping with the first two films. This is exactly what the fifth film aspired to be but didn't quite manage. Great performances and a rather believable story. What a great ending to a great sequence of films.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Been a Floyd fan for over 30 years, and PULSE is too amazing to accurately describe. Once you start it, you watch it all because you quickly become 'under the infuence' of this band even without all the original members. It has everything, new and old stuff. And if you remember when Dark Side of the Moon came out - and how awesome that album was - disc two of Pulse is that album but on DVD with mind-blowing visual effects!! These guys talent has only improved over the years so you'll be bugg-eyed like a Chihuahua in heat when you see it.
B000084T18|1.0|50 Cent is a lot of things - a skilled rapper, an intelligent businessman, a gangster (can't believe I just said that), a misogynist, a sex symbol, a modern-day Pop-Rap icon, an excellent hook writer and a reasonably okay hook \\"singer\\" (and, if \\"High All The Time\\" is anything to go by, a crack-head) - but one thing he definitely isn't is a insightful lyricist. He's just another typical Pop-rapper who wastes his mic skills on materialism, clubbin', sex, misogyny and violence, and his debut album, \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\", is solid proof. <br /> <br />Judging by the album's narrow lyrical scope, the star-studded line-up of producers (Dr. Dre, Eminem, Denaun Porter, etc.), the naked album cover art (obviously, it's to attract groupies instead of deep thinkers), the minimal guest list (Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Eminem, Lloyd Banks & Nate Dogg), the unsurprisingly solid, hard-hitting production, the abundance of undeniable hooks and the publicity-attracting diss track (\\"Wanksta\\"), this album is clearly built for multi-platinum mass appeal instead of \\"Illmatic\\"-styled artistry. This is a shame, because the fact is that 50 Cent is a very good rapper with a strong, aggressive delivery. What 50 Cent seems to lack is artistic motivation (hell, it's called \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" - can the materialistic intentions be any more obvious?). <br /> <br />Thankfully, there are a few gems to be found on this album. \\"Patiently Waiting\\" is full of clever lyrical wordplay and complexity, even if the subject matter isn't too deep, and with Eminem dropping a nice 16 bars and thumping horn / violin / bass production, the song definitely hits hard. One track that's even better is the stellar \\"21 Questions\\", where 50 Cent shows vulnerability without being too sappy over Midi Mafia's minimalist, guitar loop-driven production. Meanwhile, Nate Doog adds the icing on the cake with a pleasing hook. And as materialistic and misogynistic as \\"In Da Club\\" is, there's no denying it's catchiness and I can't fully criticise the song because I sung along to it when I was younger (which re-confirms 50 Cent as a Pop-rapper). Other than that, it's the same ol' typical Hip-Hop that's been regurgitated across radio airwaves, TV stations and the overall media for the past few 10 or so years.  <br /> <br />As bad as I consider this album to be, sometimes I feel sympathetic for 50 Cent and this album. Considering the life he's lead prior to this album (been shot 9 times, amongst other things, has gotta suck), the violence, misogyny and materialism that pollutes this album seems understandable. Then again, Nas, Rakim and a host of other dope rappers have turned tragedy into artistic triumph, so I don't see why 50 Cent can't (or won't...believe it or not, he's not as stupid as he looks or sounds). Nonetheless, \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" fails to register as a quality album to me. 1.5 stars! <br /> <br />Best Tracks: <br />\\"21 Questions\\" (feat. Nate Dogg) <br />\\"Patiently Waiting\\" (feat. Eminem) <br />
B000HEWEEY|5.0|I am very happy I purchased this collector set of Forbidden Planet. It is one of my favorite Sci Fi movies of all time. This remastered transfer of the film is breathtaking in it's clarity, detail, richness of color and sound. <br /> <br />It is the best transfer of the film I have ever seen and gives one a glimpse of a film that must have been astonishing to see on the big screen in it's day.  <br /> <br />Even by today's CG standards of special effects this film delivers. In fact it surpasses CG effects because it has a uniqueness and beauty that CG has not yet been able to capture. <br /> <br />The beautiful matte paintings of the planet and Krell machine works are truly awe inspiring. The acting is very good and the most important thing of all, the story, is truly riveting and instructive in it's scope and moral lesson. <br /> <br />I recommend all people see this film. This collector set has many extras including a cool little Robby the robot toy. <br /> <br />One warning to Amazon customers though. I ordered this collector set and had to return it twice because each time it arrived the tin collector case was dented in. <br /> <br />I finally had to buy it at Best Buy because Amazon would not guarantee safe delivery. Yes I had to pay $20 more at Best Buy but it was worth it to have a collector set that was not damaged. So inspect your tin box carefully if you order it from Amazon for damage or dents.
1582701709|1.0|First Oprah lauds James Frey. Now it's The Secret, a new age bit of nonsense which gets one star for rehashing the concept of the power of positive thinking. Am I being serious. Well, how's this for a quote heard 'round the world: \\"This is really fun. It's like having the Universe as your catalogue. You flip through it and say, `I'd like to have this experience and I'd like to have that product and I'd like to have a person like that.' It is You placing your order with the Universe. It's really that easy.\\" - Dr. Joe Vitale<br /><br />Just think you can have something, and voila, you have it. Come on now. Think about it. Now even I'm over-simplifying, but I'm willing to bet that a good percentage of the buyers of this stuff would also have fallen for zero-interest and nothing-down loans.<br /><br />I'm thinking - really hard - I'm really concentrating - that Oprah will have me on so I can sell my book. I'll give it until Monday, and then I'll think harder. I'm sure Rhonda Byrne and her publisher used the same principle. Maybe if I had Oprah's billions, I'd have a head start on thinking positively.
0671449028|5.0|This is a great book for kids and it's not too bad for adults either.  It's very cute and flows nicely. Great for bedtime!
B00005JPLU|4.0|I saw \\"300\\" for the third time at an IMAX theater.  Each time I see it I discover new things.  On IMAX the sound is 3 times as clear.  The picture is amazing.  On a large multiplex screen it is good, but just WOW! for IMAX. <br /> <br />Now I'm a woman, and an ancient pelican to boot.  And I loved this film!  I have to admit, I am a fan of violent westerns (The Wild Bunch), Hong Kong John Woo films (The Killers, Hardboiled), so knew this wouldn't bother me.  And I loved Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, another artistic masterpiece.   Fighting, blood and death in the hands of a great cast and director makes for a great time at the movies. <br />  <br />\\"300\\" is so stylised, and the color so different, that all I can say is it is a masterpiece.  Like a great battle painting, you want to visit it often. <br /> <br />\\"300\\" has a rousing story to tell, based on a true event.  It is filtered through Frank Millers graphic novel, and Director Zack Snyders artistic retelling.  Since the story is immediately taken to the realm of storytelling by having Dilios (David Wenham)  tell of the \\"brave 300\\" we understand (or ought to) that it is from the viewpoint of a Spartan warrior who is rallying the troups for the next great battle against the invaders of Greece - the Persians.   <br /> <br />Outstanding in the role of King Leonidas, Gerard Butler, owns the screen whenever he appears.   At once fierce in battle, loving of Queen Gordo (Lena Headey) and his son, laconic, all with style.  When he stands on the battlefield eating an apple, as the warriors finish checking the last of the Persian dead and dying, it is an iconic moment.  Told that there is an emisary coming to meet with him, his men are fearful it is a trick to kill him.  But he says if they do, all Greece will rise up and \\"they aren't that stupid.\\"  And after all, he say's \\"there's no reason we can't be civil.\\"  Perfect. <br /> <br />Headley's Queen is fierce and strong, and has her revenge on the villian of the piece,Theron (Dominic West).  It brings applause and/or cheers depending on which audience you see the film with.   <br /> <br />The battle scenes are amazing.  The one long tracking scene of Leonidas in battle killing about a dozen men as they charge down the field, is heart poundingly great.  Slow-mo as he engages, fast speed as he kills and twirls to meet the next - it a ballet of death.  Thank you Zack and Gerard! <br /> <br />Just leave your cares and have a great time at the movies.  From 1940 on this is the kind of film that makes fans of youth for life. <br /> <br />10/10  <br />
0307237699|5.0|Finally a person of character--articulate, educated, morally responsible and able to offer hope for our fracured political system.  This book defines how far government and politics have strayed from its intended purpose of service.  The hope offered genuine. It will inspire you to read it.  I highly recommend it as we are already in the midst of political mud-slinging.
B000O174CM|5.0|I never saw the Broadway version of \\"Dream Girls\\", but when I heard it was in theatres, I begged my sister to see it with me. She wasn't interested in seeing that movie but she came with me. I wanted to see it because Beyonce was in it and it got great reviews. When we went to order the tickets, there were so many people on the line and it's not such a popular theatre. When I saw Jennifer Hudson acting and specially singing, when she got that stage, wow, she has a powerful voice. A man in my row got up and started to clap and so did everyone else. Me and my sister did to. We clap throughout the whole movie. When the movie finished and the credits came up, everyone looked and saw Jennifer Hudson's name, we cheered for her. I knew right away she was going to win so many awards. I can't keep her name off of my head now. The first day this dvd comes out, I'm going to run to the store and get it because I know it'll be sold out.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|A older movie, but excellent, a younger generation not that familiar with musicals, should check this out.The story remains current, the performers are great,a real love story,but also about\\" people\\" accepting other \\"people\\" which sadly remains today. A beautiful, exciting movie. One you'll enjoy over and over again.
B000BJS4SU|2.0|I love John Mayers' music.  I think he is an incredible guitar player.  So I was curious about the John Mayer Trio.  Three must be better than one right?  Wrong.  I was disappointed in this CD.  Thought it was a terrible recording, (and I love live music) and felt that it was noisy and all over the place.  I would not recommend this CD to any JM fan.
B000092T6M|4.0|There are twelve extra minutes to this film and most of that time is given over to the further development of the Sheriff of Nottingham as a character.  At first, I thought, Cool more Alan Rickman, but after I watched it, I started thinking, I am a bit more confused now that I was before.  Not good. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the movie otherwise and I do like not having to flip the disk over to see the second half of the film.  The cast did a wonderful job, especially Alan Rickman.
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|Together with Underworld: Evolution, two great films. Action-packed, fast paced, great photograhpy and special effects; good plot too. A must see for action/vampire film lovers. This the first film to see. Then see Underworld: Evolution, to keep the story straight. Buy it!
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This tight moving Bond thriller is beautifully produced and acted complete with classic Bond-esque score. I think it's the best Bond film since Connery, and actually much closer to Ian Fleming's writing style. <br /> <br />And of course, set up to leave you wanting more...
B00008EY65|5.0|Great casting. Good plot. Oustanding special effects and character makeup for Hellboy (Ron Pearlman). A must for action film lovers. Buy it!
0307237699|5.0|I read some of the reviews on this site, and was encouraged to see some bipartisan support for this book.  Anybody who is planning on voting for anybody in 2008 should consider reading this book. <br /> <br />You'll be surprised to find Seantor Obamas prose strangely non-political, while being about politics.  The book highlights some of his experiences and campaigns both since and sometimes before he entered politics. <br /> <br />Most moving is the window into the women in his wife:  both his mother and his wife.  They clearly have shaped a good deal of who he has become both as a man and as a politician. <br /> <br />In the end, I think most will find Senator Obama difficult to dislike and rather genuine.  After reading this, I came to understand that nobody, and I do mean nobody has the insight into those who disagree with him more than Barack Obama.  And it is why so many on the right fear his candidacy.  If you aren't impressed with the Obama after this book, you never will be.
B000F6IOBQ|5.0|A great movie for action/vampire film lovers especially. But it is a great movie for for non-genre film lovers also. Good script, action-packed, fast paced, excellent casting, great photography and special effects. Buy it!

B000AYELVA|4.0|Good Product. Even better movie! Bryan Singer totally did this comic book justice in bringing it to the big screen. The second movie was even better than the first, but still doesn't take away from the first one as a single film. X-men was one of my favorite cartoons when I was a kid and the movie just made the story even better. The casting was great. The character building was perfect. The special affects were just right: enough to be sweet to the eye, but not overshadow the story or characters. Too bad Bryan Singer didn't stay on for the third movie. Oh well. He did great with Superman Returns.

032147404X|3.0|Having bought the SLR equipment and experimented on my own for a while, I bought this and two other books (B.Peterson - Learning to See Correctly and J.Miotke - Digital Photography) to get me moving and hopefully avoid some pitfalls.   <br /> <br />Kelby's book provides a good, if brief, basic common sense introduction to the subject and related periphery, with useful practical guidance.  It is well illustrated. All three books have much in common (e.g use the golden section in composition) although this book includes a section on wedding photography which the others don't and none deals with metering choices.  <br /> <br />Overall the book met my immediate needs rather well and I learned a lot from it.  It could subsequently have continued to provide a useful quick-reference text for the future, were it not unnecessarily long winded, repetitious (I don't need to be told x-times that film costs money and digital is \\"free\\") and interspersed with the author's (self designated) \\"humour\\" which is at best out of place and is not what I was buying. Without all the padding it could be half the size, correspondingly faster to read and easy to carry around.
0375707972|4.0|This is a timely novel, during an age of awareness of the emotional impact upon a teen-ager of a sexual affair with an adult.  This is not, I don't think, the main theme.  That deals with the Nuremburg trials and the ambiguity of guilt when those without authority are left without orders in a confusing, unprecedented occasion. <br /> <br />In my opinion, Oprah was right to choose this book.  I first read it in a Spanish translation, then found out it was a book club selection and ordered it in English.  I suspect the writing was better in German, but wholeheartedly recommend it nevertheless.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|With all the negative pre-publicity this movie received, I was not much interested in seeing it.  However, I heard from some who saw it that it was quite good.  So, I gave it a look.  It is terrific.  Now, if you want Sean Connery, or Roger Moore, or Pierce Brosnan or any other Bond, you will certainly be frustrated.  This is an entirely fresh take on Bond and I enjoyed it a great deal.<br /><br />This is Bond at the beginning of his 007 career.  He is laconic rather than full of quips.  While he can be charming and even dress elegantly, we never forget he is a killer.  Bond hasn't developed his signature martini yet and is actually conflicted about what all the violence is doing to whomever it is he is underneath.<br /><br />Unlike most of the Bond films, there isn't a single super-villain here.  Instead there are several bad guys and we are not quite sure what is actually going on until near the end and even then there is still something more than we realize.  The technology, conflicts, and fashions of the film is present day rather than 1950s - 60s Cold War.<br /><br />The fighting and action of the film is also very up to date.  While not horribly graphic, it does seem more real and in some ways beyond reality.  I am thinking of the chase scene on foot early in the film.  Who can move like that?  But it does come off as thrilling.<br /><br />The Bond Girls are beautiful, but are not mere decorations.  They have things they do in the plot.  Certainly, some are more capable than others.  But the emotional depth of what they go through is deeper than in any other Bond film that I can recall.<br /><br />Is Daniel Craig a good Bond?  Of course, you have to decide for yourself.  My wife deos wish that his face were more elegant, but I like him.  He has the kind of anger and animal energy one would expect in a killer who lasts against steep odds.  I look forward to his next film as Bond.<br /><br />If you like Bond, I say give this film a chance and enjoy it for what it is rather than wishing it were something it never intended to be.<br /><br />There is a second disk with some good features about this film and its context in the Bond tradition that are pretty good.it for what it is rather than wishing it were something it never intended to be. <br /> <br />There is a second disk with some good features about this film and its context in the Bond tradition that are pretty good.
B00005JPG1|5.0|Based on Graysmiths novels Zodiac tells the story of the press-obsessed self-proclaimed \\"Zodiac Killer.\\" Zodiac isn't just the story of the hunt for the killer, but an exploration of many characters obsessed and/or involved with the long cold case: Cartoonist turned-writer-detective Robert Graysmith is played with quirky excellence by Jake Gyllenhaal; Robert Downey Jr. is brillant as the self-absorbed strung-out reporter Paul Avery who tries help crack the Zodiac's code, Mark Ruffalo plays Detective Dave Toschi ( the inspiration for Steve McQueen)seek out the identity of the killer along with his partner played by Anthony Edwards.<br /><br />The movie doesn't just focus on the killer, or even the search for him, but the details of period, and their lives. Like UK TV series \\"Life on Mars\\" the stark difference between present-day police procedure and the 70's. This is defined neatly by a scene in which Edwards character struggles to coordinate their efforts with other law enforcement districts. Also the obsession nearly causes Graysmith to lose his family.<br /><br />I don't usually go for the \\"based on a true-story\\" type of movie or crime dramas based on actual events, but I thought this one was superb. I enjoyed seeing some of the disconnected details tie together, like the Dirty Harry homage as the real players are invited to a special San Fran's Finest screening.
0575077859|5.0|There are more swords & sorcery books out there than you could shake a battle-axe at, so it takes something really special to stand out from the crowd. And special this definitely is! Joe Abercrombie has created a truly memorable fantasy with The Blade Itself. A superb depth of characterisation becomes apparent as the players are skillfully introduced. We can all empathise with the lovestruck soldier, the benign but dangerous mage with his fondness for baths, his sickly assistant, the battle-weary barbarian, the petty bureaucrats and jobsworths, and even with the hideous and tragic torturer Glokta. Each has their story to tell. And fascinating it all is, as these splendidly three dimensional characters are slowly but surely drawn together for the breathtaking climax. <br /> <br />Brutally horrific in parts. Laugh-out-loud funny in others, this is, above all, a very human tale which has much to say about the nature of friendship, duty, the pursuit of happiness and making the most of the time allocated to us. It also contains some of the most vivid descriptions of combat you will ever read. <br /> <br />The last chapter will leave you longing for more. Please hurry up with volume 2 Joe! <br /> <br />

0740745271|5.0|The last book like this that I reviewed was Magic Eye II ;which I reviewed on May 25,2004. That book was published in 1994 ,several years after we first became familiar with these 3-D or Stereograms. This book was published in 2004 and we can see that there has been considerable advances in this artform.The one characteristic of these pictures has been that thay are easy to identify because of the repeatibility of about 6 panels or bands. This has always been a dead giveway.<br /><br /> The thing most noticeable is that the bands are much less obvious.The picture on page 11 is so good that one would hardly suspect as having floating beans within it.The picture on page 33 is very obviously a 3-D picture but at the same time is an excellent \\"floater\\".Of all the pictures,the one of the gravel on page 39 was the most interesting to me. It is so good,that one would likely not even suspect it to be a 3-D picture,unless it was in a book like this.I guess the ultimate would be when a picture is created that shows no signs of repeatibility at all. At that point you would have the perfect \\"hidden picture\\".<br /><br /> By far the biggest difference with this book in in the claims of how these images can be used to improve vision and all other sorts of things. The book is sprinkled with many testimonials from people who have experienced great things.I have considerable problem with accepting  this stuff without the research and science to back it up.Otherwise;it has to remain in the area of \\"alternative medicine\\".It does not surprise me that there is a Disclaimer to the claims on page 2.<br /><br />  Nonetheless this is a good book showing how much 3-D pictures have improved since the early 90's.
0374105235|5.0|What an amazing journey. and what a tradgedy. Even after reading the book, I can't imagine being in that environment, even as an adult. Thank you Ishmael for opening my eyes to this and the many other tragedies occuring in the world. Hopefully this book reaches the right people and we can fight to put an end to these kinds of human ordeals that no child should have to endure.
B00005JPLU|5.0|This movie was amazing. Pure and simple. Gerard Butler (who most know from Phantom Of The Opera) plays King Leonidas with a quite intensity that puts Russell Crowe's Maximus to shame. I hope this brings more attention to Butler now, as I am a long time admirer of his.<br /><br />The cast is filled with all those actors that always play supporting roles. Rodrigo Santoro, David Wenham, Michael Fassbender, Dominic West etc etc. And as with Gerard, I hope this movie brings them bigger and better movie roles.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is superb, visually stunning and at times heart-wrenching, I mean come on, who else felt bad for the Oracle? Hahaha

1582701709|1.0|I'm so happy I got this at my library.  I wouldn't want to give this woman a penny of my money.  This book is part reiterated positive thinking (which I do believe in) and part nonsense.  Women do not will themselves to be raped, you can not loose weight by eating whatever you want while picturing yourself thin and you can't stop bills from coming in the mail.  Absolutely absurd.  There are bad people who do bad things, if you eat junk it will make you fat and kill you, and if you spend money that isn't yours, you have to pay it back. I know most Americans want to think life is this easy, but even morons have to know better.  This book even borders on dangerous in parts. It tells an already materialistic overspent society to live there life like the already have the money!?!  Doesn't everyone do that already.  Are they richer?  NO!  They tell an already fat society to say \\"I can eat whatever I want and be thin\\".  Did Oprah bother to read this?  It goes against everything Dr. Oz, the Debt Diet and Bob Green preach.  Please keep your money and just think positively, work hard to achieve your goals and treat yourself and others with respect.  It's really just that simple.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|Like the title the music has just gotten better and better..After a very well written score by Richard Gibbs and miniseries by Ronald D. Moore who knew what things were to come after 2003.  After negotiating with Sci-Fi channel something has started with television never seen before.  I've never seen viewer response either on the internet or just being at work quite like this before in television history.  Every generation has a tv show that touches the heart and imagination for ages but this tv show is unheard of where unfortunately not appropriate for under the age of 14 yet it truely is a tv show for the ages in all walks of life.  Sure this is a science fiction show but by reading reviews and hearsay I've joined the unofficial street team and recommending this show to people of all ages.  Not only has the show gotten better in the first season from the mini series but also the music as well.  Richard Gibbs introduced some music which includes some in the first and 2nd season but being former Oingo Boingo musician decided to go to feature films, Bear McCreary who assisted Richard has taken the baton and has visually turned this series into an epic just by the score itself.  Not often where a tv show can rise to new heights or completely be critically acclaimed in the first season already. Where most tv shows still need for character develpment and story arc introductions where here not only did Ronald Moore turn the 1st season into new depths of television watching but also did Bear McCreary and I don't think that the first season would be quite as good as it is without this wonderful disc that comprises multiple music from the freshman season of show that sets new standards in television. <br /> <br />Not quite often does a tv show capture the realistic imagination of audiences quite like this but after reading multiple reviews of the show and soundtracks it brings new life into a generation where television shows haven't been quite the same as before and the music alone is evidence of that where no tv soundtrack sounds quite this good until now.. <br /> <br />Now as far as the review of soundtrack goes easily up there with Star Wars and Lord of the Rings plus Braveheart as one of the greatest ever made.  Oviously Passacaglia is one of the favorites but there are so many to choose from that I'm not going to review each track rather here you definitely should watch the show first and then the musical experience is doubled because you can understand where the music is coming from by underscoring each event that is happening in the movie.  Without being biased it's one of those that still sounds great without watching the show but again some tracks are understood more after seeing the show.  The soundtrack starts with the prologue with the #6 theme from the miniseries and then goes into the US version of the Main Title and ends the cd with the UK version of the Main Title and in between some of the best underscoring in television history.   <br /> <br />Back to the Main Title Us version--I can understand why it doesn't work in the context of the show but on it's own I still enjoy the theme very much having Bear put in so many hours of his time to write music for one of the greatest television shows in history.  By no means should you compare this score to the original show at all it's entirely a unique piece of writing that stands on it's own.  If you like tribal, ethnic, middle eastern style of writing you definitely are in for a real treat in this 78 minute 30 track package with great inner notes and pictures as well from the show.
0375505091|5.0|It was refreshing to see a collection of Annie's work that focuses more on the person behind the camera than the people in front of it. While I love the photos she does for the magazines, I was tired of seeing books that focused on that. That's too superficial to me. I was interested in getting into her soul. And this book gave it to me!<br /><br />From the introduction pages to the final snapshots of her children, this book kept me drawn in. I felt like I was there with her experiencing all the events. It gave me a personal glimpse of what she's been through without being intrusive. If I were to be really picky, I would say that, yes, there are some pretty obvious technical mistakes. Especially for someone as experienced as herself. But that's not what this book is about. If you want the technically flawless and aesthetically perfect stuff, go look in Vogue or Vanity Fair. If you want to see a bit of her heart and soul, get this book.

B000002GYR|5.0|This is a fantastic album. Folk, jazz, piano, guitar, Tom's younger unique voice, poetic songs. If you like acoustic music and bob dylan/neil young type voices, i expect you'd like this. No lyrics (printed out)with this CD unfortunately. This was made in 1973 - it has a timeless appeal. Get this one, especially if you've never heard him before or if think you hate Tom Waits. You might change your mind.

B00008PX8P|5.0|I never used to like LZ all that much.  I guess it's because I am a drummer and I could never quite figure out what John Bonham was trying to do.  However, over the years, their music grows on you.  Maybe because now days so much music is so much crap, you really come to appreciate the outstanding talent of every musician in this band.  This is a great selection of high energy live performances that I would not hesitate to recommend and a DVD that I would not part with!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Once again Neil, Geddy, and Alex have produced a piece of music that sets a new standard in musicianship.  The Canadian trio masterfully announce that they are back with their new single \\"Far Cry\\" and leave no doubt that they are in charge.  With Neil Peart's intelligence transcending the mind-numbing dribble that passes itself off as lyrics in this day and age, \\"Far Cry\\" once again spins a web of imagery and storyline that over the years has come to be synonymous with the Rush song.  Accompanied by Neil's \\"God on drums\\" excellence, Geddy and Alex take their bass and guitar and powerfully take the song full circle into another one of Rush's supercharged progressive-rock anthems.  These three men are truly masters of their instruments and their art.  Not since \\"One Little Victory\\" from the album \\"Vapor Trails\\" has Rush so forcefully announced that they are back...and I for one am ecstatic!!!  God bless Dirk, Lerxst, and the Professor!!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The loss of the Firefly television series was a surprising one in retrospect, and a major disappointment to its fans.  Serenity the movie provides something of a winding up, a resolution, to one of the underlying themes of the series, but still leaves fans wanting, in more ways than one.   It is also one of the few series that translated well to the big screen. <br /> <br />In describing the movie, it's difficult not to give away more than one should.  The Alliance is once more after the crew of Serenity, wanting to get its collective hands on River.  A different agent is sent, and he is dangerous, because he believes with all of his being that what he is doing is right.  But some who came before him believed the same thing.  They were very wrong. <br /> <br />If this is to be the last of Serenity on the screen, I only wish that other threads had been tied up more securely, but who knows.  Maybe there'll be another movie.  I guess it's too late for another series.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|The first time I saw an episode of Firefly, I found it silly and turned it off before it was done.  Big mistake.  Nearly a year later the series was being re-run and a friend of mine urged me to watch it.  I am after all a big science fiction fan.  What I hadn't known before was that this series was incredibly well-written, the characters well-drawn, and the stories have a depth rarely seen on American television. <br /> <br />Most of the talk about the demise of Firefly blames Fox for dreadfully mishandling it by showing the episodes out of order.  Although the network is often on the cutting edge of television, they quite often have no real idea of what they have or how to show it.  Another thing that must be admitted is that good science fiction on television takes a while for viewers to understand it and get into (e.g., Star Trek, which was not always good, but was better than anything else at the time). <br /> <br />Firefly is one of the few series that had nearly everything right.  Even the music, including the theme song, are special.  It's a shame we did not get more episodes.  But this way, the crew of Serenity will never fade into bad writing and cliches as do so many.  It ended as it was still rising.

1401307787|5.0|I have read several \\"classic\\" books on meditation and buddhism, but this book is the one to read first.  Kabat-Zinn is a wonderful writer and he speaks to a western audience in their own terms. The book is centered in Buddhist philosophy, but is sensitive to the fact that many readers are not familiar with Buddhism and are not necessarily actively interested in Buddhism or meditation as a religious practice.   Other books written or translated from well-known Buddhist authors lack Kabat-Zinn's clarity, understanding of his audience and his not overtly religious presentation of mindfulness and meditation.  Once I read Kabat-Zinn's book I was able to return to other books with a better understanding of mindfulness and meditation.  A dear friend who has been a devotee of Buddhism for over twenty years found the book to be well written and enjoyed reading it, but she was already familiar with the information and concepts he presented.  In general a very good introduction and a very good quality book.
B000G0O5N2|1.0|ok, First off everyone knows this is a great movie, but considering how many times it has been re-packaged for DVD over the last 5 years, you know they will be doing the ol' double dip trick again now that it's come to Blu-Ray. This is the first (Blu-ray) release and, yes, a great price from amazon for sure. I'd wait for the unrated extended (152min) cut that's available now for cheap on DVD. Be warned if u buy this one, more versions will come.
B000LAZDQA|4.0|Finally there is a film that rises to the intelligent choices of European cinema!  In a giant leap forward John Cameron Mitchell has broken the taboo of frankly cinematically captured sexuality that has so long embarrassed American filmmakers.  What he has created in this important experimental film SHORTBUS is not only a fascinating probe into the complexities of contemporary sexuality but also a group of relationship stories that stand on terra firma and are not merely a matrix for the frank sexuality from which they are derived.<br /><br />John Cameron Mitchell visits the relationships of several couples: a Canadian Chinese couples therapist/sex therapist (Sook-Yin Lee) who describes herself as \\"pre-orgasmic - she has never had an orgasm - married to a stay at home man (Raphael Barker): a young gay couple Jamie (PJ DeBoy) and James (Paul Dawson) who are considering opening up their monogamous relationship; a Dominatrix (Lindsay Beamish) and her long time male client among others.  The location is New York City and in this melting pot is a club called 'Shortbus' where all manner of people visit to observe and participate in orgiastic activities, all with the goal of improving their libidinous experiences and heightening their pleasure zones  And it is in this club that each of the couples meet and interface and change and grow.<br /><br />The film shows just about every form of sexual activity, none of it hidden from the camera at all.  Mitchell has the courage and skill to draw from a cast of unknowns some particularly strong characters and he is able to show full frontal tumescent men and uninhibited women like no other American filmmaker has dared.  The rewarding aspect is that Mitchell has finally succeeded in making a quality film for the open minded intelligent public who will not shy away in puritanical fright.  Mitchell's first film was 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' which has become a cult favorite. With SHORTBUS he steps further into the arena of successful American experimental cinema with a courageous and wholly enjoyable little work of art.  He is a standard bearer and hopefully will open the gates for other directors to bury the fear of filming the sexual being - especially the ages long phobia of male frontal nudity!  Grady Harp, March 07imental cinema with a courageous and wholly enjoyable little work of art.

Paul Butterfield's gritty singing and wild, dirty harp solos, Sam Lay's impeccably tight drumming, and Mike Bloomfield's wailing and vaguely jazzy guitar playing all make for a great record. Anyone looking to get into sixties blues would have a hard time finding a better starting point.

B000ICL3KG|3.0|Al Gore is trying to convince us that the rise in CO2 levels in the atmosphere is causing warmer temperatures.  That is his premise.  So he shows graphs that illustrate how over the years as the level of CO2 rises so does global temperature.  Well guess what?  What if you want to interpret the graph the other way around?  Suppose the natural increases in temperature are causing CO2 levels to rise.  Maybe because of a natural, cyclical rise in temp more forests are burning and less trees are processing CO2 into oxygen.  Well, the point is that you can interpret bits and pieces of scientific data to meet your needs.  The reason I gave this a 3 star rating is because I was entertained and amused by AG.  He is a funny clown.
0743289684|5.0|Every now and then, something truly remarkable is written. This book falls into that category. I have read very few books which hit me as hard as this book did.  <br /> <br />This is a remarkable woman. She has crossed an impassable divide, and has been able to reach the other side--after considerable suffering, work, and tears. Her journey has not yet ended. I would imagine much more awaits her. She seems to be fated to say what many do not wish to hear.  <br /> <br />How well does anyone in the west understand Islam, and all the things it does to people? Do we really understand female genital mutilation, beaten women, arranged marriages, the compuslive need to hide the feminine, and the complete loss of individual freedom? Americans still don't have a clue. This book makes a very real effort to explain a few things. It is painful, but important reading.  <br /> <br />One can read the various books on Islam--with great value. This book makes it personal, and painful. It is time the west came to its senses, and faced reality.  It is not \\"one world,\\" all cultures are not equal in value, and the individual matters much more than the collective living in darkness.  <br /> <br />On a more mundane level, the book is well-written, gripping, heart wrenching,  powerful, painful, touching, and impossible to put down. Read it, and you, too, will feel its remarkable value--and message.  <br /> <br />I wish this wonderful woman well . She has done so very much to open our eyes.

1582701709|1.0|\\"The Secret\\" is that The Law of Attraction states that like attracts like; your thoughts and feelings attract corresponding experiences. Yes, it's true that a positive attitude is helpful in anything.  However, it's not true that anyone can achieve anything if they just \\"will it\\" enough.  Quite simply, \\"The Secret\\" is just a lot of psychobabble,\\" and the fact that so many read it and swear by it gives credibility to Neal Boortz' belief that half of Americans are too ignorant to live in a free society.<br /><br />Marketing such silliness should be considered a crime.  If you want to lose weight, you could follow the advice of physicians by dieting and exercising; or, following Rhonda Byrne, you could just avoid looking at fat people and imagine yourself being thin.  We no longer have to work hard and have talent to create a good future - just imagine being successful!  (Actually, that sometimes seems to be what educators are teaching today with their emphasis on \\"feeling good\\" about oneself.)  No point either for middle-age/older folks to undertake diagnostic medical tests - if you get cancer, heart disease all you have to do is \\"will it\\" away.  Let's all escape reality and just will ourselves into NBA stardom and immortality - I'll even practice shooting, and diet!<br /><br />I feel sorry for those that take Byrne's book seriously.
1563894696|4.0|The book itself was wonderful.  The story kept me hooked from start to finish, the art was great to look at, really well done stuff.  The only thing thats keeping this from being 5 stars is the absolutely awful packaging.  Pages were falling out of the book as soon as I got it out of the box (and I purchased it new), and by the time I was done reading it, literally NO pages were still attached to the binding.  I've gotten a refund, and hopefully this was simply an issue with my copy and not the product in general.

B000MCH5P4|2.0|Watch this if you want to see a beautifully filmed, channel-surfing-style edited story about how a butterfly flaps its wings in Egypt and a hurricane happens in Mexico.  You'll have to buy into the idea that a father would leave a gun with his two bickering sons, that a Mexican immigrant would take two undocumented white kids across the border without any thought of trouble crossing back, and that the parents of the two kids in question would have absolutely no idea of anyone else these kids could stay with while their nanny attended her own son's wedding.  If your mind is like a rubber band, it might be able to stretch far enough to wrap around this 'plot'.  Me?  I'd have liked the whole movie to be about the deaf teenager feeling isolated following her mother's death.  By far, my favorite thing about this movie is the description here on the amazon.com page that says, \\"...the enormous metropolis of Tokyo, Japan that is literally the size of the state of California.\\"  Like I said, you'll have to be willing to accept a lot of big stretches to get through this one. <br />

B00005JPD0|4.0|The complicated plot of Tony Scott's thriller \\"Déjà vu\\" may be scientific impossibility, but it is surely fun for most if the action film fans. This film is probably Scott's best since \\"Enemy of the State\\" with which \\"Déjà vu\\" shares one topic - surveillance system, but the new film starring charismatic Denzel Washington is much more ambitious. <br /> <br />\\"Déjà vu\\" starts with a horrifying explosion that killed more than five hundred passengers of the ferry boat on the Mississippi. Denzel Washington's character Doug Carlin, ATF investigator attempts to find out the criminal, using the cutting-edge surveillance technology that can not only monitor the events of the past, but also do more than Doug and we think. This part you must see for yourself. Either you find yourself attracted to the concept, or you are disappointed, thinking it is just nonsense.  <br /> <br />The uniqueness of \\"Déjà vu\\" lies in the way how it develops the incredible story from the standard procedures of the agents investigating the case, to the territory of sci-fi thrillers that reminds us of such films as \\"Frequency\\" or even the world of P. K. Dick. Obviously Tony Scott chose not to use the flashy camera works that ruined his previous \\"Domino.\\" Instead he opted for slick storytelling. It works, and \\"Déjà vu\\" manages to constantly surprise us with plot twists and turns. In spite of several contrived situations that become nearly ridiculous, the film provides thrill to us by insisting on the difficulty of changing the course of time that we once experienced.  <br /> <br />Some viewers would dismiss the convoluted story as utter nonsense, and that kind of reaction is understandable. Some might say they couldn't care less if the film has plenty of plot holes, but actually the script of \\"Déjà vu\\" has a neat conclusion, which I am afraid, too neat. Still, with Denzel Washington's presence and Tony Scott's slick storytelling, I find \\"Déjà vu\\" is a pretty enjoyable ride to the past andthe future that might be.
0596007124|3.0|It encourages programmers to add retail products and product classifications by hardwiring them into code. This is not how it is done in practice nor should it be. In practice you have product tables (RDBMS) and product classification tables (many-to-many relationship with products). The code will then apply features based the product & classification table(s), but you do not directly create product taxonomies/classifications by typing them into the programming code itself. Designated users add to these tables (via edit screens), usually not the programmers themselves. If you were creating a Human Resources application, would you want to hardwire all the employees into the code? I've worked with multiple retail applications, and product classification was almost always table-driven so that one didn't have to call the programmer every time a new product or product grouping came in. You have to keep as much info about products as possible dynamic and user-tunable. I do have to give them credit for at least using practical examples. Too many other books use just shapes, animals, and device-driver examples.
B000F5GNX8|4.0|Satiring many of the conventions of the action movie genre that he helped create; Shane Black weaves and directs the enjoyable and fun Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.  Robert Downey Jr. plays Harry; a small time hood who inadvertantly gets confused to be an actor.  After flying out to L.A., he gets embroiled in a devious plot of mistaken identity and murder, while teaming up with a gay private detective (Val Kilmer) and trying to win the love of his life (Michelle Monaghan).  Black does a wonderful job, and his cast is even better as they are clearly enjoying themselves; particularly Downey and Kilmer whose quick witted quips and interplay are enough of a blast to carry the film on it's own.  The only downside of the film is that at times it takes itself too seriously, but Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is an enjoyable ride regardless.  Fans of action movies, particularly those who have seen a number of ones from the 80's and early 90's, will get a real kick out of this film, and should definitely check it out.
B00005JPG1|5.0|A smart, engrossing, exhaustive trip through the investigation of a serial killer, \\"Zodiac\\" gets first-ballot election to the hall of definitive crime pictures. It's a movie of shadows, noise and gunfire. It's about those nights when each grain of sand on a gravel road makes its own sound under the weight of a black Mustang. <br /> <br />The movie embodies the intoxicating, bewildering, constant threat of murder, a phenomenon unique to a community invaded by a serial predator. Even Nebraskans have been touched by it: If you were a 6-year-old living in Omaha in 1983, you knew the artist's composite of the man who killed those two boys before you ever heard the name John Joubert. <br /> <br />Yesterday I looked up Joubert's sketch online and saw those doe-like, alien eyes more than twice the size of his mouth, all under a blue ribbed stocking cap. <br /> <br />I had nightmares about that drawing, about being snatched off the sidewalk and dumped in a ditch. Safety stickers went on windows. The FBI rolled into town and invaded our milk cartons. Kids stopped walking to school. <br /> <br />That's the mood of \\"Zodiac.\\" Its fuse may burn for almost three hours, but it must. James Vanderbilt's screenplay, based on Robert Graysmith's book, spans 15 years, and it ends with no one behind bars. Yet Graysmith's writing and director David Fincher's dreamy, elegant visuals, tightly grasp the moment and the obsession of the men hunting for San Francisco's most famous serial killer. <br /> <br />Fincher opens the movie with the Zodiac's third and fourth known victims: a married woman and one of her misters parked on a lover's lane in Vallejo, Calif. Not long after this murder, he starts writing letters to the local newspapers, including the San Francisco Chronicle, where columnist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) spearheads the coverage, while cartoonist Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) lurks around the editorial conversations on how to cover the murders and how to help catch the murderer.<br /> <br />Graysmith - divorced, nerdy and awkward - slowly evolves into the movie's key catalyst. He observes as the Zodiac leaves cryptograms concealing messages, courts the media, inspires false confessions and floods the two homicide cops assigned to his case, Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards), with phony claims and leads.  <br /> <br />By the movie's final hour, Graysmith alone is pursuing the case with a zeal that costs him his family. The investigation, carried out over several years and split into three acts, is too dense and rich to explain in a review. What Fincher conveys is the pleasurable enormity of it. <br /> <br />Like a novel, \\"Zodiac\\" sprawls out and revels in tiny details. It loves the names of places. It cares about whether the Zodiac killer wrote his \\"k\\" with two strokes or three. It's fascinated with the guy who knows a guy. It appreciates the trickiness of warrants. And it has the right - because it's unsolved - and the guts to sincerely invest in red herrings. It's about the pursuit of truth, not the revelation of it. <br /> <br />The ensemble cast snugly fits into this story. Gyllenhaal may not be the ideal actor to play Graysmith - he's almost too wide-eyed - but he finds the right notes in the movie's final hour, when it's Graysmith's show. <br /> <br />As Toschi, Ruffalo creates a man who inspired Steve McQueen's \\"Bullitt:\\" thick, tough, clever and clearly fond of haberdasheries. Edwards does a nice turn as the forthright partner. <br /> <br />Downey, in one of his better recent performances, makes the writer Avery into a smart, cocky reporter chasing Hunter S. Thompson's lifestyle a little too passionately. When he crosses the line, he does it for the right reasons but gets burned by his ego and addictions. Dermot Mulroney, Philip Baker Hall, Brian Cox, Donal Logue and other actors play it completely straight in their supporting roles and play straight very well. <br /> <br />And then there's John CarrollLynch, who plays a prime suspect, Arthur Leigh Allen. He has only a few scenes, but they count. If you want to see a creep, watch this performance. <br /> <br />\\"Zodiac\\" is Fincher's most polished, mature work. \\"Se7en\\" might be a centerpiece of any 30-something's movie collection and \\"Fight Club\\" is, for all its absurdity, memorable pop culture. But \\"Zodiac\\" mixes Hitchcock and 1970s paranoia dramas without gunning the gas pedal, like Spike Lee's overwrought, unhinged \\"Summer of Sam.\\" <br /> <br />Fincher subtracts the flash of previous works to add cohesive professionalism. The movie has a certain, almost plastic sheen on it. The murders seem surreal and stage-like, cribbing from Errol Morris' famous documentary \\"A Thin Blue Line\\" and feeling like a Flannery O'Connor short story, when dread, violence and the Almighty converge for blood judgment. <br /> <br />\\"Zodiac\\" is ordinary enough to be unsettling and twisted enough to be compelling. It will be long forgotten for the 2008 Oscar season, but it's the craftiest, best film of the early year. <br />
B0000024R8|4.0|1. Any real Dylan fan should have his debut release, just to know that Bob did not spring from the earth singing \\"Like a Rollin' Stone.\\" <br /> <br />2. Any true fan of traditional folk should have a copy, to hear what the 20-year-old found interesting way back in 1962. <br /> <br />3. Anyone interested in the history of American recorded music in the second half of the 20th century should shelve this CD, in order to appreciate that once upon a time, Columbia Records paid smart people to find unique talents and produce records by them, even if they had no audience at the moment, and were not likely to win a big one with their first effort. <br /> <br />4. Bob's original \\"Song to Woody\\" is of historic significance, since at this early stage of Dylan's professional career, he was visiting Guthrie in the hospital, meeting Cisco Houston, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Pete Seeger and other friends of the tragic genius.  <br /> <br />5. It grows on you, even if you don't like blues and Dylan's early voice so much. His guitar and harmonica playing are also strong on this one.
B00026WU82|5.0|If there's ever been a better album made in the rock era, I have not heard it.  It opens with the landmark \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and sustains that high level all the way through.  Combines various genres of music: rock, folk, blues, Tex Mex, country and the effect is mesmerizing.  It's nice to hear Dylan when he could actually carry a tune, and his rich, raspy voice serves the material well.  The musicianship is first rate. Especially noteworthy is the blend of organ, guitar and harmonica on several songs.  Dylan kept raising the bar with his albums and it never rose higher than w/ this incredible album.  Check it out.
B000LC55F2|5.0|it was nice how they kept the theme down to illusions until the somewhat surprising real magic twist that really made this movie stand out for me. i was happy to see that they could not only separate the elements, but combine them as well. i won't mention what that magic twist was, but it was a great combination of the real and fake magic that really made it work for me.<br /><br />it seemed a little bogged down at moments, but those were necessary to derive all the necessary explanations needed to keep this movie believable and realistic, so i can't detract value from that because overall the entire movie was a success. they had a way of explaining things that didn't seem to go way over my head, and i appreciated that.<br /><br />magicians who basically perform all the way throughout their lives. that element right there is a nice thought. people so determined to trick others that they would adjust every moment of their lives to make their acts on stage seem overwhelmingly believable. it sounds like the CIA or some other government agency. even down to the old man with the fish bowl who adjusted even the way he walked just so he could always perform that trick without anyone noticing otherwise.<br /><br />above all, i liked the sci-fi twist that actually seemed realistic by the way it was created. if you are at all into magic, you will probably enjoy this. i liked this better then the illusionist, and i loved that movie.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|Murray Gold is an orchestral genius. He creates mood and character through his music unlike any composer in a long long time. I've always loved the 'Doctor Who' series and the beautifully themed scenes added to the new series makes it all the more sweet to enjoy.<br /><br />I've noticed on my CD however, that the 'Harriet Jones' theme is suddenly cut short. But I received one of the very first copies of this CD, even before it was released to Europe, which was an oddity. A website had them for preorder, and shipped to the US first. I'm not sure if my CD was later edited with a fix on this theme. Anyone else have a glitch on the the 'Harriet Jones' theme?<br /><br />Otherwise this CD will be something to treasure and enjoy. Especially 'The Girl in the Fireplace' and 'The Face of Boe' themes.

1582701709|2.0|First off manifestation itself is undeniable, but the law of attraction is just made up new age BS. Its just a lame attempt to explain how manifestation works. Go look into Quantum Mechanics, there is no \\"law of attraction\\", its no where to be found. Manifestation itself though, works, and is undeniable, how it works we're not so sure yet.    Secondly, The Secret tends to ignore anything negative, they give you some type of false idea that all you need to do is visualize and imagine your desire and then you'll \\"attract\\" it happening. That may work for some desires but not all. For the desires that you've always wanted but just could never seem achieve you will run into possibly unlimited obstacles if you visualize and imagine the feeling of it happening. This is because unconsciously you already have many blockers or insecurities preventing you from achieving that desire. You've been conditioned by your past experiences...The Secret tends to ignore this and makes it seem as if even if you've been conditioned all your life to be poor that by simply imagining being rich you can be. It ignores all the negativity and even tells you not to monitor your bodily feelings and thoughts. Suppressing and hiding your negative thoughts and insecurities is not the way...    If you want to read a good book on Manifestation go read Stuart A. Lichtman's How to get anything for money fast book, thats by FAR the greatest most comprehensive book on manifestation. It doesn't mix in any of this new age pseudoscientific BS into it and gives you a lot better information. Its written by an MIT Student who actually studied neurology and how the brain works, not any of this pseudoscientific nonsense.    In conclusion \\"The Secret\\" is not bad and may be inspirational but it is very far from the truth. Think about it if they really knew the actual \\"Secret\\" then why couldn't they get \\"The Secret\\" to be aired on TV as originally planned? Why did they fail to \\"attract\\" it? Aren't they supposed to beexperts at manifesting....?     A lot of the new ager crowds will be angered by this review but I'm just speaking the truth.......
0439813786|4.0|I first heard about this book during an interview on NPR, and knew I had to see for myself what they were talking about.  I have never read, or should I say, \\"looked\\" at a story quite this way.  I found myself getting lost in Selznick's highly detailed illustrations, which pulled me deeply into the story.  To say it is a children's book is limiting; this book is a wonderful read for any age.
B000MQC9H4|3.0|After about 45 minutes of overdone laborious set-up, at least half of this overlong, dual-track 2006 romantic comedy takes flight, while the other half remains stubbornly contrived. More problems persist when three of the four principals show an affinity for screenwriter/director Nancy Meyers' brand of breezy but manipulative farce, while the fourth seems like he doesn't belong in the movie at all. A calculated throwback to golden-era Hollywood in more ways than one, the stacked-deck premise is simple enough - two women, Amanda in LA and Iris in England, both unlucky in love, decide impulsively to switch houses during the Christmas holiday with the intent of celebrating their emancipation from men bad for them.<br /><br />Amanda's side of the story is the more pleasurable of the two because ironically, it doesn't veer too much from formula. At first, Cameron Diaz's performance as type-A movie trailer producer Amanda seems heavily exaggerated, but once she meets Jude Law, very Grant-like (Cary or Hugh, take your pick) as Iris' smooth-talking brother Graham, she settles down as he is the epitome of the Sensitive Man for reasons that become clear soon enough. Probably because the actors are such striking people, their chemistry is palpable and unforced, as their characters pretend not to fall in love when it is obvious they are. Iris' LA adventure does not fare as well. Although Kate Winslet is dependably winning as Iris, her natural vibrancy and beauty seem at odds with her role as a doormat to an ex-boyfriend who keeps stringing her along.<br /><br />The stateside romance is also more convoluted as it involves her almost-instant friendship with an aged Hollywood screenwriter who refuses to be the subject of an industry tribute. It's nice to see 91-year old Eli Wallach play the curmudgeonly writer with old-world charm and a wry sense of humor, but the subplot feels forced as an excuse to provide a more direct connection to the Hollywood film classics. Even worse, Jack Black is completely out of his element as Miles, a sardonic film composer already in a shaky relationship with an actress. That Iris and Miles get together seems more like an afterthought since there is zero chemistry between Winslet and Black. The resulting imbalance between the two storylines adds to the interminable feel of the movie's 136-minute running time.<br /><br />Even though there are a handful of funny sight gags (mostly spotlighting Diaz) and a clever three-way phone conversation with Iris at the center, the film is burdened by its leisurely pacing and Meyers' indulgent approach to the material. Thanks to Jon Hutman's picture-postcard sets, especially of the English countryside, and Hans Zimmer's appropriately romantic score, it certainly feels like the Hollywood confection that she was trying to replicate. The 2007 DVD has a robust commentary track courtesy of Meyers and several of her crew like Zimmer, Hutman and editor Joe Hutshing but featuring none of the stars. There is also an eighteen-minute making-of featurette, pretty standard, along with a number of previews for current and upcoming theatrical releases like \\"Spider-Man 3\\".tely out of his element as Miles, a sardonic film composer already in a shaky relationship with an actress.

B0000264XJ|5.0|The Doors debut record has to arguably be one of the greatest debut records of all time, up there with The Mothers of Invention's `Freak Out' (1966) The Velvet Underground's `Velvet Underground & Nico' (1967) Jimi Hendrix's `Are You Experienced?' (1967) The Clash's `The Clash' (1977) and Black Flag's `Damaged' (1981). The thing it lacks is the influential stature of some of the above albums but it had the chart success.<br /><br />In 1967, the summer of love, it climbed to the no.1 spot on the billboard charts mostly aided by the success of the edited single of `Light My Fire'. While the rest of the album has many highlights like `Break On Through (To The Other Side)', `Crystal Ship' the focus of the attention is on `Light My Fire' and the Oedipal drama of `The End' that got them banned from the Whisky-A-Go-Go. `Light My Fire' with it's lengthy solo is an excellent example of modal playing which was based on the music of jazz giants John Coltrane and Miles Davis. The idea is to improvise over just one or two chords without falling into the pentatonic trap. Interestingly according to Krieger he used the same two chords Coltrane used on `My Favourite Things' (Am & Bm). Apart from the obvious reference to drug taking in the lyrics the structure of the song emphasises the swirling repetitive `high' of the solo before the final come down into the 3rd and 4th verses and outro.<br /><br />`The Doors' is probably the only popular record that adequately captured the true atmosphere of 1967, the summer of love as well as its darker elements. Love's `Forever Changes' (1968) may be a better record but like the Velvet Underground's no one heard it. The problem with the record is that it was virtually impossible to follow up. All the albums released afterwards seem to somehow pale in comparison, with possibly `L.A. Women' being the only exception, however this is an outstanding debut that is nearly 40years old, yet still remarkably fresh sounding. It should be in all record collections.collections.  <br />
B000L43AN4|5.0|I'm a newcomer TW fan and I've listened to his music starting from Rain Dogs, Swordfishtrombone... to the newest releases, and I've found him kind of lost in his latest albums (but on the way). This album Orphans is his peak: 56 songs and I couldn't find a single music I didin't like, even when he is just jabbering stories is great. Perfect.<br /><br />Long way from the crankiness of Black Rider, thank the Lord!
B0009A40ES|4.0|I would argue that since we really haven't evolved all that far since our primate days human males still have loads of aggression and animalistic behavior they need to get out. And despite the best efforts from civilization in general to neuter them that aggression still has to go someplace. In Mary Harron's \\"American Psycho\\" it comes out in all the wrong places. The film is a character study of one Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a Wall Street yuppie by day and an ax murderer by night. Patrick is a man who has been forced to the edge because of the fakeness that surrounds him. It's not just the suits and the empty conversations either. It is the peeing contests over who has the best haircut or apartment or business card. He tries to talk about his problems, he really does, but nobody listens to him because nobody listens period. To their ears \\"Murders and Executions\\" is interchangeable with \\"Mergers and Acquisitions.\\"<br /><br />The film is a big punch in the face to the egotistical businessmen of the 1980's. This particular Gordon Gekko is overdone and overacted by Christian Bale in a great performance. He is robotic, phony, arrogant and absurd. He is the kind of guy who will have a 3 some with prostitutes just so that he can admire himself in the mirror doing so (all the while flexing his biceps). More than anything he is militantly materialistic. He is Dexter mixed with Jim Profit, only he likes to style and profile while taking an ax to a co-workers head. The whole point, which is made clear in the final scene, is that while these people may truly believe that only the glossy veneer matters it is really the inside that counts. Just because these people make enough cash to swim in, Scrooge McDuck style, doesn't mean that their behavior is excusable. Harron paints the modern businessman as an American Psycho, and it is all too fitting. To make it in the business world your conscious and your soul must be turned off, you must be turned into Patrick Bateman.<br /><br />The film is a great success. As a horror movie villain Patrick has one of the most compelling backstories ever. Every scene has great energy to it and even though Bale looks a little out of place his acting is so good you can't stop watching him. There is something of a conflict presented when Willem Dafoe shows up to play a detective on the case of one of Patrick's murders. That storyline is interesting while it lasts, but it is never quite wrapped up. I would also admit that after awhile I got a little sick of swimming in these debaucherous waters. He may never tire of having it dirty and bloody but I eventually did. The character is endlessly fascinating (what is up with his love of cheesy 80's music?) and the scene where he kills Paul Allen will leave you stunned and hypnotized. The male need for aggression isn't going anyplace and we need to find a good way to channel it. . .otherwise we are going to have a lot more Patrick Bateman's and Iraq Wars on our hands. ***3/4br /> <br />The film is a great success.

0974153001|5.0|I dabble about in clay but spend more time carving wood and this book is just a dream come true! The secrets behind how she creates her figures are so invaluable that I should send a thank you to the author for so generously sharing them. Wood carvers spend money buying just one book to cover carving noses, another for carving the mouth, etc.--but this books covers them all.  <br /> <br />Of course sculpting in clay involves adding on and woodcarving involves taking away, but still there is much to be learned from this book!  <br /> <br />It's a book I'll keep forever, if I can just keep my daughter from \\"borrowing\\" it.  <br />
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Although the full chemistry one might seek between Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester is not achieved in this Ruth Wilson/Toby Stephens version of JANE EYRE, the scenes, Georgia Henley as the young Jane and other players make this a most satisfying version of the Gothic classic.  And that first glimpse of Toby Stephens as Rochester after the mishap with the horse drew me fully into this production.  Intriging man!    Jane and Mr. Rochester, in the novel, have full, rich conversations which really brings them on equal footing as thinking, sharing adults.  This version has Jane saying too many, \\"Yes,  Sirs\\" without her intellect getting more development.  There are lots of inferences to the quality of their time together, but not quite enough examples of how satisfying the experience is for both Jane and Edward.      After Jane is in her new location, I did like the use of flash backs to the last days at Thornfield Hall when it becomes obvious they cannot be married.  I think it illustrates how much she continued to think about him and her love for him as she mends from the long days wandering on the mores.      I particularly liked the use  of candles and the reality of darkness and shadows at night which would have been true in the 1840s and 1850s.    Maybe I was just in the mood for a new Jane Eyre, but this production gave me a very satisfying new look at Bronte's heroine and her Mr. Rochester.
B00003CY5J|4.0|This is a robbery movie that has some twists and turns .. I think you will enjoy it.. With these two actors you really cant go wrong. DO not read much of the story-line because the ending you dont want to know... watch the movie ...!!!
6305907145|5.0|I had never read this book, but this adaptation ranks right up there with Sense and Sensibility and Emma.  Wonderful acting, and much funnier in parts than I was expecting. Couldn't be improved.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|For me (only my opinion) the 2 songs Telegraph road and Private investigations alone are worth this CD. These are 2 amazing musical arrangements that is really really hard to find these days. I'm not saying the other tracks are bad. My other favourites are the Title track and \\"It never rains\\".   <br />I have been listening to this album for more than 10 years in cassettes and older CD versions. I even tried to get a LP version recently. Then I found this and picked this up recently as this is a remastered one. Believe me when I say this is the best version I have. The sound is full compared to the older CD version and I get an amazing feel when I play it every time. This is a very good remastered version. Highly recommend this remaster to all the quality conscious dire straits fans.
B000M06K5C|3.0|I just don't like the new sound. Sure they've grown, but it's not the growth most fans were looking for. They simply just deviated too far from the new post-punk sound they created on Silent Alarm. The lyrics however are a little more interesting, and little more introspective. I'd give this album 3 1/2 stars mostly impart to the song Kreuzberg, which is hauntingly perfect. Probably one of my personal top five favorite  Bloc Party songs.

B000ICL3KG|3.0|I was not very convinced of his correlations - it is easy to conjure those to fit what someone wants to hear either way. And the delivery was very smooth which while entertaining smacked a bit of homiletic technique rather than sincerity. But I did note one personal note Gore related that rang true with me. It was relating the story of how his sister had died from smoking. I could see clearly the parallel he drew between the denial of harm from smoking and from pollution. I'm not by any means an environmentalist, but I do believe in keeping our world in the best possible shape whether there is danger to it that is imminent or not. So for the parts I found sincere and even a little entertaining, 3 stars.

0780626494|5.0|A paranoid scientist builds a full sized home in a large nuclear bomb shelter for his pregnant wife. A plane crash that he thinks is a bomb prompts him to whisk his wife down below, and they live in the shelter with enough supplies for 35 years.  <br /> <br />But the father has an apparent cardiac episode in the early 1990s, and so they send their son (Adam) to the earth to buy supplies. He meets a beautiful girl named (surprise!) Eve, who befriends him and helps him to find his way in the world. <br /> <br />There are many funny and entertaining moments, and Brendan Fraser does a great job of playing the well educated, well behaved son. I lover it when he tells the guy at the memorabilia store to stop taking the Lord's name in vain. The store owner says \\"Why, do you have a problem with it?\\" Adam says \\"Yes, I have a BIG problem with it!\\" <br /> <br />Adam not only has a lot to learn from the world, but the world has a lot to learn from him. This was one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a while.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|There are 2 locations on More Than A Feeling where Delp reached the plateau of high octave plateaus.  At about 2:30, going into the first guitar solo, and then at 3:33, going into the final chorus.  Listening to these over the years always made the spine tingle.  I didn't think a human could hit that high of a note, falsetto or otherwise.<br /><br />Tom Scholtz, the mastermind of Boston, stated upon first hearing Delp audition for lead singer, that it took only a couple of moments to realize he found Boston's singer, and also one of the best rock singers he had ever heard.<br /><br />Brad Delp -- Boston's lead singer passed on March 9, 2007.
630542828X|4.0|I really like this movie as much as Erin Brokovich. In some ways I found it more realistic. But I only gave it 4 stars because I couldn't get over how even a small law firm formerly successful let itself go under on one case. There was probably more to the story that didn't make it to the screen. But I would have thought they'd find some way to balance things to keep some income coming in - go slower and keep one or two of their attorneys still working on money making cases - or just focus on finding harder evidence first and referring it to the EPA in the first place. But anyway I would recommend it as much as Erin Brokovich.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|I've had this album for 15 years now (the non-remastered version) and the sound seemed to lack a little punch and excitement. The sound on this new remastered CD is much better than the old version, everything is crystal-clear and exciting - a great improvement! If you love this album but only own a regular CD, I totally recommend this remastered version - it's so much better! I am not stating the obvious here: I also have several remastered Led Zeppelin CDs which, surprisongly, aren't ANY better than the regular versions! Dire Straits' remastered Making Movies album is also much better and clearer than the old recording!

B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is an awesome movie. I really liked because it takes a new approach and shows a more humanized bond rather than the ice cold smooth one you usally see. Now I'm not saying I don't like that bond because I do I was just glad to see a new take on a great franchise and can't wait to see the next one. <br />
B000MTPANQ|5.0|It is hard to believe that so many years have passed.  I discovered Neil at the age of 14 or 15, over 35 years ago.  More than any other artist of the day, he influenced my teenage years which now seem a lifetime away.    I learned guitar and wrote my crappy little songs because of Neil.  I wore the plaid shirts.  In fact, that style of shirt was always known as a \\"Neil Younger\\" around our house.  (My Dad even took my little brother shopping at Penney's one time and asked the sales clerk where the Neil Youngers were!)    These now very familiar songs were pretty much brand new in 1971 and they sound brand new all over again in 2007 stripped down to just Neil, his inimitable guitar style and piano. I am not sure that his voice ever sounded stronger than it does here.  The production is crystal clear and beautiful.  Like other reviewers, I agree the audience is a tad loud and obnoxious in this intimate setting and I tire of the banter after the first listen.  Even so, this recording is absolutely essential and deserves classic status.      As an adult, I have shifted my worship to a higher being; nevertheless, I do thank God for Neil's music which still has the power to move me and make me feel alive.
B00006IU73|4.0|In Absentia feels like a much darker album than it's successor. Critics have written before about the band's attempt to make a concept album about a boy who grows up to be a serial killer. The lead song, \\"Blackest Eyes,\\" may suggest that but the song itself has a great sound with powerful riffs, while the band create a tripping jam on \\"Gravity Eyelids.\\" \\"Trains,\\" and \\"The Sound of Muzak,\\" are two of the band's best cuts with the latter referring to the demise in the quality of music being created today as they sing, \\"The music of the future will not entertain. It's only meant to repress and neutralize your brain.\\" Sadly, the band may be right as they sing how one of the wonders of the world is going down, but with their own brand of progressive metal, Porcupine Tree show sufficient momentum to modernize rock music and make it mainstream again.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Though many Red Hot Chili Peppers fans have condemned this album and marked it as the band's assent into pop, I must wholeheartedly disagree.  As the band has grown and changed over the years, it has produced many different styles of music, and this is the only record that displays all of their versatile and wide-ranging talent.  Songs like the energetic and head-banging \\"Readymade\\" and \\"Storm In A Teacup\\" are reminiscent of 1991's Blood Sugar Sex Magik, while numbers like \\"Dani California,\\" \\"She Looks To Me,\\" and \\"She's Only 18\\" sound like 1999's Californication, and the relatively unknown \\"Hey\\" and \\"Desecration Smile\\" remind the listener of 2002's By The Way.  Yet ballads like the insanely popular and epical \\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\" and \\"Slow Cheetah\\" show that this record is not merely a continuation of past cds but has a definitive sound all its own.
B000000OUJ|5.0|It's hard to figure out why GZA's masterpiece did not get even more recognition. This album justifies his \\"Genius\\" nickname. Dark and heavy, superbe production by the RZA and tongue twisting lyrics by the usual Wu-Tang suspects. The extracts from the movie \\"Shogun Assassin\\" solidify the whole Shaolin flavour of the album. If you've never listened to Wu-Tang, you should absolutely try this album along with \\"Enter the 36 Chambers\\", \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\" and \\"Ironman\\". These albums represent everything that is (or at least was) great about hip hop.
1575666286|5.0|Comprehensive, even though spread out a bit--you do have to pull all the information together, but it's all there.
B000MTOKY6|4.0|The \\"Mlps\\" has the same gatefold as the vinyl, all lyrics are readable considering their size.  Unfortunately, the cover picture reproduction sucks, on the last remastered version you could see her hair, this seems to be the new complaint, it used to be the sound, now it's the art (the recent Moody Blues reissues come to mind...), speaking of sound, the $64,000 question is...seems to be remastered.  Nowhere on the sleeve or disc is ANY information, but I must say it sounds fantastic.  They've also reproduced the orange \\"steamboat\\" label complete with an orange \\"r\\".  So, should you buy it?  If you are a fan(atic) or audiophile nut, go for it, otherwise the last version is fine. (Docked a star for the horrible cover reproduction.)
1582701709|2.0|These SECRETS are a rehash of good principals wrapped in a blanket of sensational marketing schemes.

B000002LQR|5.0|Though they have become more radio-friendly and upbeat over the years, this is the album that truly defines the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  This is the one that catapulted them into the life-changing world of popular music, the one that shows how they got their start, and the one that best displays their undeniable talent and insane chemistry.  This collection of rhythmic and audacious songs is hardly recognizable to the band that produced 2002's By The Way and 2006's Stadium Arcadium, but it is nonetheless a showcase of outstanding music.  This is the real Red Hot Chili Peppers, in all their \\"explicit lyrics\\" and tube-socked glory.

0751532711|1.0|I was expecting to write a glowing review of this book. I had heard about it for so long, know people who speak about it as if it might be paper gold, have seen Kiyosaki on PBS and knew this was going to be important and change my life.    For a brief moment it was important and life changing. Then I started it over from the beginning. On second blush (first if you are lucky), this book says very little, gives no actual advice and could potentially derail any progress you have made toward becoming \\"rich dad.\\"    Like many books of this ilk, Rich Dad, Poor Dad is good to get you to think about your own situation. However, also like many books of this ilk, its writer is rich and famous for writing the book and not, at least not evidenced here, for actually making money via the methods described for us.     We all want to be rich. We are all searching for books and methods that will help us reach that goal. Unfortunately, most of the experts and writers that are available to us speak in generalities and may not be what they say they are. Don't fall for it.    Really, look away.     If you want to read something that will give you the financial education that Kiyosaki doesn't, buy The Entrepreneur's Guide to Finance & Business: Wealth Creation Techniques for Growing a Business by Steven Rogers. Your friends have not read it, your father-in-law will never send it to you. It won't make it onto 20/20. It will help you understand the real ins and outs.

B000JVRPUI|3.0|I ordered the Ultimate Collectors Edition (HD-DVD) back in December. I finally got around to watching it yesterday in my weeks old Toshiba HD-A2 HD-DVD player. To my surprise, I found that this disc is a standard DVD version which outputs at 480p, and not an HD-DVD. I think Amazon may have inadvertently mislabeled it. If you want a true high definition version, you must order the one with the red HD-DVD case or you will end up with a standard definition version.  update: I contacted Amazon about the issue of receiving a standard DVD instead of an HD-DVD and they apologized and shipped me another Ultimate Collectors Edition (this time correctly in HD-DVD) and said that I could keep the standard def version as well. Amazon definitely does what it takes to ensure customer satisfaction. The image quality of the HD-DVD version is obviously better than the standard def version, but it will not blow you away in image quality.

0694003611|5.0|Every child on earth should own a copy of this book. It has been a favorite for all three of my sons. It's a classic that is probably the best known among the first books for children. It's a perfect gift for anyone you know having a baby.
B00004LN16|5.0|Ok, so it's a little more mellow than your Highway to Hell or your Powerage, but this album just rocks. There are only two songs I don't like and they both come close to the end. Safe in New York City is their best song since Thunderstruck. Stiff Upper Lip improves on Ballbreaker. It has a similar sound. AC/DC sounds a bit different now, but I love it just as much as their old stuff.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This movie caught me and i'm still thinking about it but i'm going to review the product because it's just redundant say that this film is one of the best of 2006. The package of the 2 disc special edition is nice and elegant but i wonder if some costumer found in this product a booklet or something beside the two discs because there is anything else in the case.Cheers
B0002MB7QW|1.0|This movie is really bad, I mean \\"Showgirls\\" bad.  Don't believe me?  The premise is a fast-forward ice age that basically occurs overnight.  So, it's certainly high on the believability factor.  And the culprit?  Of course, it's global warming and all the selfish human beings who brought it about.  And, oh yeah, Mexico becomes a safe-haven for Americans and we have to beg THEM to come into THEIR country.  And if you think that's bad, just wait until you see the acting.<br /><br />The only part worth watching was when a reporter gets dusted by a flying billboard flung through the air by an LA twister.  It was great - almost as good as the T-Rex eating the lawyer in Jurassic Park.  My advice, watch that part then turn it off.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|This album is crazy awesome...different than your average...well...anything album.  For anyone that ever wished Faith No More would pump out some tracks with a funky DJ, then this is your dream come true.  Patton's dark, diverse vocals clash with deep hip hop beats to make a truly unique sound.  Very in your face, not meant for beddy time...VERY cool graphic design as well...creepy ;o)
0374105235|5.0|I live in the U.S. where we do not have to see our children conscripted into armies and taught to kill each other, as happens in many other places. After I read the novel on this theme, \\"The Wounded Bird\\" by Jerzy Kosinski, I felt that children killers could never feel human love and happiness again. I have been waiting for a true story that would show exactly why children become killers and what happens when they are later given a chance to live a normal life.<br /><br />Ishmael Beah tells this true story.<br /><br />And I want to thank him from my heart for letting us know about his experiences - the horror, the rehabilitation, the return to life. That he can be happy again restores hope in the human spirit, a hope we all need in these times.

B000FOT6JM|4.0|This Swedish electropp dup is still pretty low-profile, though the Knife seem to be following in the footsteps of Broadcast -- eerie, atmospheric, pretty pop music. Third album \\"Silent Shout\\" returns to the band's root sounds, after the harder techno of their last album, and it's a breath of electronic fresh air.<br /><br />It opens with the blippy, spacey beats of the title track, which shimmers all over the place over some heavy grounding beats. A chorus of voices murmur, like a choir of robots. It's a great intro, and it's a big contrast to the song that comes after it -- the ominous, stomping techno of \\"Neverland.\\"<br /><br />The rest of the album is an attempt to reconcile the two previous sounds the band has had -- hard techno, and airy electropop. After \\"Neverland,\\" there are a couple straightforward techno songs that sound like a spacier Autechre, including the robotic \\"Like A Pen\\" and the schizophrenic space bleeps of \\"We Share Our Mothers' Health.\\"<br /><br />But the majority of these songs are softer and stranger. The Knife dips into spacey experimental music, tropical ambience with eerie yowls, shimmery electropop, ominous lullabies, and one song that sounds like a distress call from a spaceship, set to a soft electronic beat. It winds up with the undulating, whispery \\"Still Light,\\" which is perhaps the creepiest song of all.<br /><br />In \\"Silent Shout,\\" the Knife strike a good balance between techno and experimental soundscapes, which was missing from their previous two albums -- both were good, but they had entirely different music. They've learned moderation, using the harder beats in a softer melody, and also creating dreamy soundscapes that may not get people dancing, but might transport them to another planet.<br /><br />The harder beats don't even sound catchy -- they sound more like a sonic attack. Other synth gets twisted into kettle drums, pretty shimmers, and eerie sonic walls. Karin's voice is heavily filtered by computers, but this isn't done because it's a bad voice. Rather, it makes the pretty, fragile vocals fit in with the otherworldly music, as she lets out a series of Bjorkian yowls and murmurs.<br /><br />The Knife would do a great job with the soundtrack to a sci-fi movie, since they already have the right sound -- chilly, eerie and beautiful.t this isn't done because it's a bad voice.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|If you go into this movie and expect alot of action, you will be dissapointed. This was more like an older boxer with one last fight in him. It was kind of slow but, it really was well done. Of course you have the Rocky training song and sequence which definitely was needed in a true Rocky movie. There was good dialogue and rapport with the characters. Paulie is his usual self and Rocky is the Rocky from Part 1. It was well made and me being in my 40's, was kind of like a fitting end to a great series since I grew up watching all of them. It does make you a little sad though at the end knowing it is the last link to a great movie.

B000FP2Z0S|5.0|This CD is awesome from start to finish. It's worth every cent I paid for it. Even the somewhat mellow song \\"Roadside\\" is great. Tim's voice is so versatile, he can sing softly, scream, he even almost raps in Bricks and Chamber the Cartridge.<br /><br />  The 1st three songs are my favorite. I love them, and I don't think they could've been done much better. I don't really get why this CD is parental advisory, not that it really matters, but I'm curious. Other than the drug reference in Injection and the consistant use of the F-word in Survive, I don't think this really should've been PA, but whatever.<br /><br />Here's my breakdown of the CD:<br /><br />Chamber the Cartridge 10/10 - Fast paced, and the chorus is awesome. The \\"save us\\" part is cool, too.<br /><br />Injection 10/10 - My personal favorite. This actually inspired me, as a writer, to create a story nearly 250 pages long. The lyrics are beautiful, if you get past the whole \\"give me the drug\\" thing.<br /><br />Ready to Fall - 10/10 - Catchy chorus. Cool screaming part.<br /><br />Bricks 8.5/10 - I think it's kinda short, and the lyrics go really fast, but it's still good.<br /><br />Under the Knife 9/10 - Love this song. The 'Wake Me Up Inside' line always reminds of \\"Bring Me to Life\\" by Evanescence.<br /><br />Prayer of the Refugee 9/10 - A deep song. Do I sense an implication of anarchism?<br /><br />Drones 10/10 - A song about how working people are slaves to the system. It has a lot of meaning, if you read the lyrics.<br /><br />The Approaching Curve 8/10 - It's basically talking to a beat, but it sounds cool. Reminds me of \\"Institutionalized\\" by Suicidal Tendencies. The chorus gets a little repetitive. Also, who's the girl singing?<br /><br />Worth Dying For 9/10 - Um...I can't really pick out any particularly awesome stuff about it; the whole thing's great.<br /><br />Behind Closed Doors 9/10 - ...Is this a song about a barroom fight? Whatever, I love it. ^_^<br /><br />Roadside 9.5/10 - A little slow, but for a mellow song, it's deep and meaningful. Again, who's the mysterious girl?<br /><br />The Good Left Undone 9/10 - I didn't think you could turn a song about picking a flower into such a pretty work of art.<br /><br />Survive 9/10 - Tim's gone F***-happy in this song. He says it in like every line. But the song doesn't disappoint; it's just as good as the others.<br /><br />I can't really express in words the feeling that this CD gives, you just...have to listen to it. Seriously, this isn't just a random punk band that won't go anywhere. I bought this CD because I read a review of Rise Against in a magazine. I had no clue what they sounded like then, but now, I love them. This is definitely one of my All-Time favorite CDs.de 9.5/10 - A little slow, but for a mellow song, it's deep and meaningful.

His use of baroque chord structures had never been done before . If you think you are a good guitar player , try this . The only weak spot is the pedestrian ( even by heavy metal standards ) lyrics . This is a landmark release .
B000NNPT8C|1.0|The first movie was an amazing film it had it all tension, horror etc. The second film was a slight let down. This film was a complete waste of time! It was rushed and parts of the story just simply did not make sense. For example the missing police man mentioned at the start of the film? The police woman who was killed by one of the Saw's machines? The whole thing just did not mesh together. It was obviously rushed and shows it. A real shame as this could have been a good film.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|Although this is Scorsese's best film in recent years, with razor sharp editing and direction, it comes up short compared to his masterworks:  Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas.  On a positive note, this is how re-makes should be done, but there a few things I have a problem with.  First, this should not have been the film Scorsese received his first directing oscar for (save his integrity for a Lifetime Achievement award, Alfred Hitchcock anyone??), and secondly,  The Departed is a recent remake of the Asian film Internal Affairs.  If you've seen this film before The Departed, there was a chance you came out with a serious case of deja vu.  And if anyone has seen Howard Hawk's 1932 classic gangster masterpeice Scarface, will easily notice Scorsese paying a somewhat nauseating homage of the overty used 'X' motif.  The film is completely drowned in it.  From the first shot of Jack Nicholson delivering his opening monologe, to the final showdown at the abandoned building, there is an 'X' forshadowing an inevitable death.  Stylisticly it fits the film, but this film didn't contain enough original material to run away with Best Picture, and Best Director, although this was the case due to the weak selections this year.  Don't get me wrong, this is a very entertaining film, with great acting from a solid lead and supporting cast.  Alec Baldwin steals the scene whenever he's in the frame.  Ray Winstone is always at the top of his game and highly underrated (check out Nil By Mouth, The Warzone and Scum and see what I mean).  DiCaprio shows glimpses of brilliance with his tortured character, and Jack Nicholson does what he does best, and plays it cool.
0321344758|4.0|I am a Web/Multimedia designer at a large corporation and happen to be currently in the midst of a major site redesign project with too many cooks in the kitchen. This book not only confirms a lot of what I already know, but gives me some insightful ammo to combat the arbitrary decision making process of others involved in the project, particularly when those decisions might otherwise result in unclear or confusing interface design decisions being made.<br /><br />Sadly, after a couple of lunchtime reading sessions it's almost over. I wish there where more chapters to read, which really isn't much of a complaint at all.<br /><br />Buy this book if you do any type of web design at all. I think many of the principles discussed in the book apply to other tasks/roles such as graphic design and page layout in general as well. Light reading, short chapters, easy to get into, filled with lot's of \\"Aha! I knew my intuition was right about that!\\" and a few \\"Oh, really? Maybe we should try it that way instead\\" moments. Good stuff.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|This movie is an instant crime classic.  Worthy of being mentioned in the same sentance as The Godfather and Goodfellas.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|Probably my favorite thing about Wilco is that each of their albums is completely different from one another... however, what makes their latest effort different from previous ones is that it's hard to categorize this record. It's not experimental like YHF, it's not alt-countryish like A.M., it's not raw like Ghost is Born... it's mostly just a bunch of simple, beautiful songs, half of them being ballad-like. I'll say right now that, outside of a couple blazing guitar solos from Nels Cline, I don't think that Jeff uses the instrumental talent of his bandmates (or himself) enough on this record. I thought \\"Ghost is Born\\" had some unbelievable percussion and guitar moments, and that is mostly lacking on \\"Sky Blue Sky\\". With that said, I've already found myself singing along to all 12 tracks on this record, and the best moment for me is the very opening acoustic guitar strumming on the first track, \\"Either Way\\", followed by a classic-sounding opening vocal from Jeff, which has already been hard to match in the live performances of the song.     You gotta respect a guy who plays before thousands of people at most shows and decides to make a quiet, little record to tour off of. Wilco is one of those bands that is not meant for the big arena, and this album, probably more than any of their others, will be unkind to the big venue. It'll be interesting to see how the band delivers these mostly quiet little songs to a large mass of fans.
B000000OE7|4.0|\\"Made in Heaven\\" is Queen's final studio album, released in November 1995. After Freddie Mercury's death in 1991, the remaining band members John Deacon, Roger Taylor and Brian May worked with Mercury's pre-recorded vocals to create the last Queen album with all four members having contributed. <br /> <br />The album feels and sounds like a late 80's Queen album with Freddie singing every song and sounding much healthier than he does on \\"Innuendo\\" as alot of this album has been taken from prior recordings. Only three songs were recorded by Freddie prior to his death: \\"A Winter's Tale\\", \\"Mother Love\\" and what would become \\"You Don't Fool Me\\". The song list includes: <br /> <br />* \\"It's a Beautiful Day\\" - a previously unreleased song written and recorded by Freddie Mercury at Musicland Studios in Munich, 1980.  <br /> <br />* \\"Made in Heaven\\" - a track from Mercury's solo career, appearing on his album 'Mr. Bad Guy' in 1985. Taylor, May and Deacon reworked it (over Mercury's piano and vocals) to make it a Queen track. <br /> <br />* \\"Let Me Live\\" - the first single features a gospel-style choir for the opening. Freddie, Brian and Roger each then sing a verse. <br /> <br />* \\"Mother Love\\" - the last song Freddie Mercury recorded and co-wrote with Brian May, who on his website discussed the writing process he and Mercury had (writing both separately and together, and conscious of the nature of the song and the lyrics). May sang the last verse since Mercury wasn't able to do it. <br /> <br />* \\"My Life Has Been Saved\\" - composed by John Deacon in 1987-1988. <br /> <br />* \\"I Was Born to Love You\\" - originally recorded (piano, vocals, synths) by Mercury on 25th May 1984, for his 'Mr. Bad Guy' album. <br /> <br />* \\"Heaven for Everyone\\" - a track Roger Taylor wrote and tried out with Queen in 1986, but then dropped and recorded it for The Cross (his other band, where he was lead singer and rhythm guitarist instead of drummer). <br /> <br />* \\"Too Much Love Will Kill You\\"- a typical power ballad composed by Brian May (with Frank Musker and Elizabeth Lamers) sometime between the Magic and Miracle sessions. They wrote it in the US and Freddie Mercury sang on it.  <br /> <br />* \\"You Don't Fool Me\\" - one of the last tracks recorded for Made In Heaven. It reminds me of a more mellow 'Scandal'.   <br /> <br />* \\"A Winter's Tale\\" - the last song Mercury composed entirely (\\"Mother Love\\"'s music is by Brian May). He did the vocals and keyboards for it and completed the last verse around two weeks before he died. <br /> <br />The overall feel of the album is one of reverence, reflection and references to our existence. Only the song \\"I Was Born to Love You\\" has an up-beat tempo. The production is of a superb quality considering the difficulties the band faced. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I dismissed this album at the time as I was into other mid-90's music and Queen felt long dead. The title, \\"Made in Heaven\\", was just too corny and I still felt (up until recently) that it was just an attempt to hold onto something that wasn't there anymore. It was only when I went back into a Queen phase (12 years later) that I even considered buying it. But it was very popular in the UK at the time with the first single \\"Heaven for Everyone\\" reaching No. 3 and the album going four times platinum selling 1.5 million copies. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a worthwhile coda to Queen's career. I find it very easy to listen to and reflect in turn on their impact on my life.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Hey it's early in the year so it might change... anyways... <br /> <br />This album is great, it is for sure an amazing follow up to the already great funeral.  It's got these fast poppy catchy songs like keep the car running and then it has the epic glorious intervention, and then ones that have their own ability to be interesting like black mirror.  It flows really well and I have listened to it like 12 times through.  Pick it up!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Up until I saw this Masterpiece version of \\"Jane Eyre\\", my favorite version was the A & E production.  I wasn't sure at first about the understated portrayal of Mr. Rochester but Toby Stephens won me over.  The two leads were very believable and they did total justice to the story.  I also loved the musical score which was sweeping and romantic.  I am pleased to as this DVD to my collection.

B000MGUZM0|4.0|This is a great album, which I find myself surprised and pleased to say, since I consider myself a somewhat jaded listener. Arcade Fire has a very 80s sound, most notably similar to Echo & the Bunnymen. The sound is 80s, not because of its production, but rather, because of the performances. The singer croons and hiccups in a way we haven't heard in a while. They're not limited to that style, however, which is one thing that makes them interesting. They bring in a lot of other influences, some, that during the 80s would have seemed in philosophical opposition to New Wave, such as Springsteen and the Blues, and integrate them in a way that can only happen after the passage of time. The mood and style change from song to song, not letting you get bored. All that being said, interesting stylistic choice does not in itself result in significant music. The real reason this is a great album is that these are well-written, well-arranged songs. Upon first listening, I found myself saying \\"Wow\\" outloud at one point. Arcade Fire gets you hooked with infectious melody and haunting words, and then once they've got you, they take you somewhere you never expected, and that's where you really feel it, and you might say \\"Wow\\" yourself.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|You can almost envision the folks who planned this film version of the great TV series thinking: \\"Okay, so we've done Maverick, I Spy, Starsky and Hutch, and Mission Impossible. What else do we have that we can bring to the big screen. Oh, of course, Miami Vice..Crockett and Tubbs and the pet gator and the fiery sensuality of Miami. It's too perfect. Now all we need is a screen play.\\" So what happened with this film? We have a fine director in Michael Mann and a decent cast with Jamie Foxx, Colin Farrell, and Li Gong. The film just doesn't go anywhere. Now don't get me wrong - I didn't view Miami Vice expecting Chekhov or O'Neill. But I did expect that it would have interesting characters, explosive action sequences, a great soundtrack, and a believable, interesting story with a few plot twists and some suspense. This film has none of the above. On the TV show, you got the sense that Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas were comrades and brothers. Other than mumbling at each other, Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx don't seem to share much in common. Li Gong is a wonderful actress but she seems completely miscast. There's little if any chemistry between her and Colin Farrell's character. The TV version boasted a great soundtrack in its own right and effectively used recordings from other artists to punch up the action. The film's soundtrack is eminently forgettable. Ultimately, every film rises and falls with its screenplay. And that's the single biggest problem with this film. The storyline offers nothing new beyond the standard war on drugs scenarios. If the producers and Michael Mann thought it over and opted for a different look from the TV show, that would have been fine but this script is dead in the water. The actors don't seem to connect with one another and the plot goes nowhere. For what it's worth, I think what they really should have done was to take the Crockett and Tubbs characters as older law enforcement officials a year or so from retirement, call them in on a case involving some druglord from 20 years ago who's responsible for murdering their old boss (Edward James Olmos), then end the film in a fiery shootout between Crockett and Tubbs and assorted villains. Crockett dies in the shootout and we have a sad but somewhat moving ending. A good film should elicit some emotion, some feeling from the viewer. This film only elicits yawns.in on a case involving some druglord from 20 years ago who's responsible for murdering their old boss (Edward James Olmos), then end the film in a fiery shootout between Crockett and Tubbs and assorted villains.

B000A7S4B0|4.0|Black Rebel Motorcycle Club has really done it with this album. They've stripped away all of the \\"cool\\" effects and have gotten down to what's important: writing great songs, and performing them in a way that will move the listener. This is a \\"back to the roots\\" kind of album. There's a sense of discovery in this album that makes it very exciting. The band's exploration into the Blues broadens and increases the power of their work. At the same time, they bring something to the Blues that we haven't quite heard before, reinvigorating the Blues for us, and reminding us of why it was great in the first place.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|i've seen neil live, acoustic, solo, in new york around the time \\"silver and gold\\" came out, and he was absolutely amazing, after all the years between that performance and the one on this CD/DVD. frankly - and you don't have to share this opinion - i get a little bored with \\"folky\\" soloists who strum quietly for over an hour, even if i am a fan of the artist's studio effort. but neil is unique: he doesn't merely \\"strum:\\" his peculiar syncopated guitar playing has such a powerful \\"traction\\" to it that he gives you a sense of forward motion and the need for foot-tapping even with the softest songs. a good example are the perennial cowgirl in the sand and down by the river, which have a totally different quality acoustically than they do electrically - but are just as gripping emotionally . i already own most of these performances on a very good bootleg, but the sound here is pristine: you get something like studio quality with the warmth of neil playing in his living room. for any other artist, if i owned as many versions of his songs as i do of neil's, i'd say this is absolutely not necessary - but i am more than happy to own this, and i think you will be too. the unreleased \\"bad fog of loneliness\\" is not a highlight, the rest is impeccable. <br />this is not a very detailed review because i see that others are already pouring in and doing a good job - no need for redundancy; my five stars speak for themselves, and there must be very few humans on this planet who don't already know these songs.  <br />a quick mention in response to one reviewer's comment: \\"time fades away\\" DOES exist on cd - i own it, and i see that amazon had it at some point, although it is not available now. <br />

B00004Z4SD|5.0|A few weeks ago my 18-year-old son asked me if I had ever seen a movie about an old man who drives his lawnmower on a long trip to see his brother before he dies.  I said it sounded vaguely familiar but no, I couldn't recall actually seeing that movie.  He said he had watched it on tv late at night and it was about the best movie he had ever seen.  Last night, it was on again. I had to stay awake until after 4 AM to see it, but it was worth it.  For it to be so moving to both an 18-year-old boy and his middle-aged mother, viewing it from two such different perspectives, it has to be something special. And it is.
B000M341QE|5.0|At first I didn't know what to expect just because it was an oscar winner didn't necessary mean it would be good or appeal to my tastes - well it was excellent and what an ending, this has it all the love interest, backstabbing, murder, lies, everybody playing everybody - I don't think there has been a crime film this good since HEAT, can't wait for the sequel.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This is as good as it gets. The set list is stellar, the sound quality is perfect. Rarely do you hear a live album that is so true. Neil is alone with his guitar and piano. In spots it seems a little strange to have the audience NOT recognize songs, during the intro. notes, that later were huge hits. The simplicity creates perfection. A must purchase for any fan of Neil Young !
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul really reaches inside his soul and doesn't ruin these songs with  overkilled, cluttered or silly songwriting. The songs sound basic but there's magic in every song. The album is very reflective, relaxing and really enjoyable to listen to. He's not trying to reach back into his past and re-spark his rock-n-roll roots like he has on previous solo albums thank God. A 60 yr. old master of ballads shouldn't do that. A lot of this album is about love.    I think the lyrics \\"There's a long way from chaos and creation\\" in the first song \\"Fine Line\\" is absolute musical genius. The entire song is deep, the song makes a lot of sense and it's full of creative lyrics and fantastic rhymes. Great way to start off the album.    The second song \\"How Kind of You\\" is very personal. It's about someone who thought he was good and did the right things throughout his life but questions these traits throughout the song and is reaching up to someone  else for the answers. He has a sort of cry in his voice. The harmony is beautiful. It starts out very softly: \\"I count on you to think of me when I was out of sorts. It really meant a lot to be in someone else's thoughts, someone else's mind, someone else as kind...as you.\\" Fantastic songwriting. This could easily be a song written to Linda.    The third song \\"Jenny Wren\\" is Paul with an acoustic guitar. Very soft song with a beautiful melody.    \\"Certain Softness\\" is a love song with a very subtle Latin atmosphere to it. Listen to this and you would think Paul has mastered Latin songwriting and love ballads. Again extraordinary songwriting.    \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" is slow and incorporates a hint of strings. Very reflective and catchy: \\"I did my best. I used a gentle touch. I've done it for so long. But why pretend? I think I've heard enough..of your familiar song.\\" \\"There was a time when everyday was young. The sun would always shine. We sang along when all the songs were sung. Believing every line.\\" No one writes lyrics like this anymore.    \\"Promise to you girl\\" does have somewhat of a Beatles beat to it similar to \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" but it's not a heavy rock and roll tune. Real nice song.    Some of the lyrics in the songs are very quaint somewhat like nursery rhymes, lullabies (with great metaphors) about love, life, relationships and they're clever, totally genuine and wonderful to listen to. He doesn't strain his voice one bit throughout the album like he did through the 90's and that's a relief. This is sentimental. He sounds like he's singing you a song from his personal piano in his home. And the album is far from being corny.     This is the best I've heard Paul's voice, melodies and songwriting in years. I could listen to this CD over and over and not get tired of it. This is very mature music and it's what Paul should be doing. He should have won a Grammy for this record. This is a far cry from \\"My Brave Face\\", thankfully.

Also, I strongly advise anyone who has no spiritual foundation in the true identity of God (He is a Spirit) to research otherwise you will believe the cynics.. The \\"Secret\\" is the best thing that has come out in a long time, It answers those questions you've been presenting to God as to why your life hasn't improved.. I believe the immergence of this presented itself because so many people were frustrated with their existence and began asking God.. \\"What is it that I'm doing wrong?\\"  \\"Why is it I don't have the life I always wanted?\\"..

If you you're an old guy, or girl, and you like Traffic, then you'll like this CD. Maybe even if you're not old. It's a bit corny in parts, but it's good creative rock and roll.
0618680004|5.0|Mark Twain once said something to the effect of, \\"It's not the parts of the Bible I don't understand that bother me, it's the parts I do understand.\\" Colonel Robert Ingersoll, Bertrand Russell, to name others, were also humanitarians who stood up against the folly of religion. I'm glad that the secular and non-religious movement is once again gaining, and hopefully as the world becomes modern these views will become a solid part of mainstream thought, and contribute to a more benevolent way of life.    This book is hope that people who see through religion can finally get a voice. Sure, not enough religious people are getting the point, but if the ideas of atheists, or non-religious thinkers, can become mainstream, then everyone can have access to the concept that there is morality in basing one's judgments on facts.    Richard Dawkins' books reiterates and strengthens the views of those that already believe and know religion is a man-made myth, and for those undecided he will likely pull many over to these concepts.
1843532727|5.0|We have lived in Japan for 14 of the last 20 years and have spent the last 11 years living in Tokyo.  Over that period of time, we have bought and used Lonely Planet, Fodors, National Geographic, and several less well known guides to Japan and specific cities.  Of course the best guides to Japan are written in Japanese, and there are many of them.  However, if you are like us, looking for an English guide, we have consistently found the Rough Guide to Japan (third edition) to be one of the best books available, particularly if you are hoping to visit smaller cities in outlying regions.  It covers many more cities than will a Fodors or National Geographic, although you will not have the glossy photos of some of the other books.  In a guide of this size, complete coverage of Japan's geography, history, culture, and attractions is simply impossible.  And there will always be a few errors and omissions.  Nonetheless, this is simply one of the best guides you can find for trips that include visits to more remote regions of Japan.    We have used this guide book for trips to Okinawa and outlying islands; Hiroshima, Himeji, Okayama, Matsue, and elsewhere in the San'in / San'yo region, and to Matsumoto and the Kiso Valley.  The regional maps are good; the city maps are just ok.  We have found the material on transport informative and useful.  The information on hotels and restaurants is incomplete, but is more comprehensive than just about any other guide out there, and the recommendations and reviews for hotels are accurate and useful.  It lists the major sights, and picks up many notable sights in the smaller cities that are completely forgotten by most other guides.  One thing we like about this book is that it tells you where to find more information once you arrive at each city or station.      Conclusions:  *  If you are looking for a solid general reference that offers as much coverage as possible in one English language book, it is hard to go wrong with the Rough Guide to Japan.    *  However, if you want to be comprehensive, you'll need to use this book in conjunction with other references and material.  The internet is often a good source of recommendations and up to the minute information.  Maps published in Japan, some available in both Japanese and English, others only in Japanese, are also very helpful.  If you have the time and money to consider other books, the following would complement the Rough Guide to Japan:  -  Gateway to Japan (Kodansha).  It's old (1998), but still very useful for remote cities and attractions.  There will be a fair amount of overlap, and the Rough Guide will be more up to date, but this book is one of the best for trips to outlying areas.  -  National Geographic Traveler Japan.  Good photos and walking routes, but the coverage is nowhere near the level of the Rough Guide.  Together, they make a good set.    Hope this helps!

B000MGUZM0|4.0|I'm still not quite sure how it happened. How Arcade Fire became the new 'it' band--music media darlings from Canada. While their first album, 2004's \\"Funeral\\", stalled at something like 137 on the Billboard charts, \\"Neon Bible\\" managed to zoom in at number 2, with something like 92,000 copies sold in its first week (30% of which were digital downloads--new technology be damned!)<br /><br />With all of this adoration, one might wonder if it's warranted. Yes and no. To me, Arcade Fire sits alongside all the other 80's revivalists in recent years (which I like, of course). On the other hand, one could argue that the band isn't re-inventing the wheel...yet. They do show promise, and I liked \\"Neon Bible\\" better than \\"Funeral\\". The same pitfall is evident though, by the end of the cd I felt the songs did not necessarily stand on their own individually. In other words, Arcade Fire still needs to work on diversifying their songs so that they aren't similar to one another. That said, \\"Neon Bible\\" has plenty to like. The best songs are easily \\"Keep The Car Running\\" and \\"Intervention\\". Both tracks should be modern rock/alternative rock hits, and dare I say, Top 40 hits.<br /><br />The rest of \\"Neon Bible\\" is a mish-mash of good songs with some duds thrown in. For example, the first single, \\"Black Mirror\\" is decent, but not great, followed by the title track and \\"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations\\". Also, \\"Ocean Of Noise\\", \\"(Antichrist Television Blues)\\", \\"Windowsill\\" and \\"No Cars Go\\" are also good. That leaves two unavoidable duds--\\"The Well And The Lighthouse\\" and \\"My Body Is A Cage\\". Both tracks could have been left off and no one would have missed them.<br /><br />The best thing about Arcade Fire is that they are a group of musicians who play well and create interesting music (something that's lacking in popular music today). They are not an image or a face, they are a band that makes good music and write some interesting lyrics (better than \\"What you gonna do with all that junk, all that junk inside your trunk? My hump, my hump, my lovely lady lumps.\\")<br /><br />So, if you're a fan, ignore the negative feedback written about \\"Neon Bible\\", and if you are new to the band, pick up a copy, you will not be disappointed.unk, all that junk inside your trunk?

B000M5B6Q0|4.0|Usually in movies where one or more of the characters is a pop star the music said \\"stars\\" sing is pretty bad.  The soundtrack to the romantic comedy \\"Music and Lyrics,\\" however, is an exception--and it succeeds further by nailing completely different ranges of the pop spectrum.  On one end are the songs done by Hugh Grant, playing a washed-up member of a Wham!-like eighties pop group.  \\"Pop Goes My Heart\\" is straight outta 1984 and ridiculously catchy while \\"Meaningless Kiss\\" is a great knockoff of Wham!'s \\"Careless Whisper\\" right down to the sax.  On the other end there's the modern pop tart Cora Corman, played by newcomer Haley Bennett.  Sounding like a cross between Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson, her songs wouldn't sound out of place on modern Clear Channel pop radio among Beyonce's and Ciara's latest, although \\"Entering Bootytown\\" lays it on a little thick.  \\"Buddha's Delight\\", with its deliciously cheesy organ intro, will stick in your head for days.  Ironically, the weakest song is the song that is the centerpiece of the film, \\"Way Back Into Love,\\" a totally forgettable ballad.  Adam Schlesinger, who wrote the title song for the film \\"That Thing You Do!\\" and captured the essence of early sixties pop so well does the same great job here (although he didn't write \\"Pop Goes My Heart\\").  When the soundtrack plays such an integral part in a film a little attention goes a long way, and \\"Music and Lyrics\\" is a great example of that.  A good movie, a REALLY good soundtrack.

B000063UR1|5.0|Although this film is over 30 years old it is still relavent today.  It does not beat you over the head with a message but gently suggests what could happen.  This is done with class and believability.  You will laugh and cry and be left pondering.  This is one of my all time favorite sci-fi films.  The music is top notch and the special effects are great in that they are so believable.  You'll love it and the end will leave you speachless.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I am an avid fan of period dramas, so when I first saw the previews for this movie I couldn't wait for it to come out. <br /> <br />If they had a satisfaction guarantee at the movie theater, I would've asked for my money back. This movie is appalling in its complete lack of substance - not to mention its failure to stay in keeping with the actual book. <br /> <br />The actors are poorly cast and Keira Knightley in particular struggles under the weight of portraying what is arguably one of history's finest and most complex literary heroines. The worst offense, however, is the absolutely unsuitable, unknown actor cast in the role of Mr. Darcy - a character whose disdain and disapproval of almost everything in life are completely lost on the actor.  <br /> <br />Perhaps if the cast & director had read the book before embarking on this disaster, we would've all been spared such an abysmal and offendingly bad movie.

1904233023|5.0|But I don't think this is your typical sci-fi book.  This book is one of my husband's favorites and he talked me into taking a look at it - swore that I shouldn't get hung up on the sci-fi aspect.  He was right (Damn!  I hate it when this happens!).  I found it to be an epic and poignant story primarily about human character, philosopy, sociology, and morality.  One of his criteria for enjoying a book or a movie is that there has to be a hero or at least a character that can be admired.  This book is all about heroism and has characters one can empathize with.  I came away strongly reminded again that at the end of the day, your honor and your character are all you have to offer. I admired the way that Ender perservered, always thinking, changing, adjusting his tactics to win, honestly, fairly, and in the most efficient way possible.    Card is an easy writer and has that quality of making the reader forget they are reading.  An interesting aspect of this book is that most of the characters are children.  Sounds odd, but you forget this as you are reading.   Adults in the story don't have the luxury of treating the main character, Ender, and the others as kids.  The whole effect reminded me of when you were 13 how you understood more than adults gave you credit for...Well, the children in Card's novel think that way too.   It gives the story an authentic feel as we read what a child is thinking, not what an adult thinks a child is or could be thinking.    All in all a very pleasant surprise.  Another book that, without explanation, I remember most every detail.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|`Stranger than Fiction', the umpteenth Will Ferrell comedy of the last three years, directed by Marc Forster, is, as virtually all critics proclaim, by far Ferrell's best effort among all these flicks. I will certainly agree with that, but I offer the notion that the quality of the film is attributable to a greater extent to the writing of Zach Helm, the directing, and the acting of Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson. And, I also give a nod to the value of the cameo appearances by Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce, who are probably seen on film far less than they deserve. The one `above the title' performance which left something to be desired was the role played by Queen Latifah. She did well, but her appearance just disappeared into the background as part of the environment in which Emma Thompson's character, novelist Karen Eiffel moved.<br /><br />I've never been a big fan of Ferrell. I certainly never looked forward to his movies as I would to those starring Jim Carey, Robin Williams, or Bill Murray, or even Dan Ackyroyd for that matter. `Elf' was entertaining but every one of his other recent efforts (I haven't seen `Taladega Nights' yet, and that may change my opinion.) seem to be modest at best. But, he certainly contributes much to this movie, largely by playing against his usual type.<br /><br />One strong argument that the value of the film rests primarily with the writing is in the character actor performance of Dustin Hoffman. The role needed none of the kind of talent he put into films such as `Rainman', `Kramer versus Kramer' or `Midnight Cowboy'. All he needed to do was to play a slightly quirky but highly qualified Literature professor at a major New York City university. While Hoffman executed his business flawlessly, it was very good business and dialogue indeed. Much better, for example than what he had to work with in some other recent comedies such as `Meet the Fokkers'. A similar statement can be made for the performance of Maggie Gyllenhaal. I don't recall seeing her in any other film, but if I did, her performance did nothing to stand out. That is certainly not true in this film.<br /><br />The best demonstration of the film's quality writing comes near the end, where the principals, Ferrell, Thompson, and Hoffman's characters are trying to decide how the story should end. This situation gives away nothing to anyone who has not seen the movie, since the trailer makes it clear that Ferrell's character is itself a character in Emma Thompson's novel in progress. The whole setup for this ending problem shows the very best in dramatic creativity. The real irony is that it fits in perfectly with the question posed by Hoffman to Ferrell to determine whether the novel in which he is a part is a comedy or a tragedy. The problem of the ending is ultimately in the resolution of this question.<br /><br />As great as this movie is, it has one sour piece of business that sticks out like a sore thumb, where a demolition crew begins tearing down Ferrell's apartment building. This too is in the trailer. I won't say why it is a weak piece of business, but I think you will find it so as well.<br /><br />I am not sure I would rate this movie as high as `Ghostbusters' or `Animal House' or `Blazing Saddles', three comedies I enjoy rewatching on a regular basis, but it certainly is worthwhile to own, even if, unlike these others and those from my favorite Woody Allen flicks, it is light on subtitles discovered only on a second or third watching.Gyllenhaal.

1563899426|4.0|Fables 1: Legends in Exile by Bill Willingham, art by Lan Medina and Steve Leialoha is a beautifully illustrated tale of fairy tale characters living in New York.  The story begins with Beauty and the Beast complaining to Snow White, the deputy mayor of Fabletown, about Beast's inability to go out in public because of his horns and furry face.  He becomes less human and more beastly with Beauty's waxing and waning affection for him.  Snow tells them to see a marriage counselor as Little Boy Blue escorts them to the door.  Then the Bigby, the police chief formerly known as the Big Bad Wolf, informs Snow that her sister Rose Red is missing, possibly murdered, and the story kicks into high gear. The story is a standard crime drama, but with so many fairy tales characters thrown in, it's a wild ride.  Cinderella kickboxes with Bluebeard.  Rose Red was dating Jack the Giantkiller.  Prince Charming is in town and planning to sell his castle and title. All of the fairy tale characters have been exiled from their lands by the Adversary, which explains their settlement in New York. Willingham ties the characters together giving them more backstory than we've learned from the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Anderson with rivalries, secret affairs, and fear.  As Bigby and Snow work together to find out what happened to Rose, the chemistry between them crackles.  The ending is entirely satisfying, and I couldn't wait to read the next book. The artwork is terrific, clean lines, beautiful colors, and the covers are outstanding. A word of warning: there is one completely gratuitous graphic sex scene, and several of the characters spew profanities.
B00005JPLU|3.0|i thought this movie was gonna be great, it has some great effects and its really different from most war movies, they have done a good job on the fighting scenes, but what i didnt like at all was the way they showed persians, persians didnt dress that way in wars and they werent bisexuals, if any of you have seen the movie alexander then you will understand what i mean about the persians,but if you just like te wars and the gore and to see some cool mutants then its a good movie for you
B00006ADD5|4.0|I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Of course, I'd first seen this film about 35 years ago.  I was too young to appreciate it, so I purchased the DVD and watched it in one sitting last night with my 13-year-old son.<br /><br />The scenes in the desert are absolutely intense...the long journeys on camel back through Sinai Desert, the sand storms, the hot sun beating down at midday and the lovely setting suns...I felt like I was there.  Of course, having a 72-inch screen to watch this epic on helps.<br /><br />I must admit I found the actors a little too over-dramatic at times (Omar Sharif's speech intonations and Peter O'Toole's facial expressions), but still enjoyed it. I sometimes found it helpful to turn on subtitles and read rather than watch so intently as the acting was distracting to the actual message. Two or three statements made in this film are amazingly relative especially in light of our Middle East situation today.  You'll hear quotes from the Quran (Prince Feisal of Mecca's tent) and statements by the actors playing the Arab roles (esp. among the ununited tribes of the Arab Council during the chaos in Damascus and during dinner with Auda's tribe) which are remarkablely prophetic.  The British campaign in the Middle East theatre (removing the Turks at Aqaba) at that time certainly had ulterior motive.<br /><br />Another suggestion is to watch the entire film then go back and watch the first few scenes.  It all comes together much better by doing this because the film is so long.<br /><br />Now my son, although interested, found some of it amusing and laughed out loud at scenes that were not meant to be funny.  I am sure this can be blamed on the several generation gap.  We started the movie after dinner and since it had been a long active day, he fell asleep and unfortunately did not see the end as I did.<br /><br />Lawrence of Arabia is a thought-provoking portrayal of an historical event.  I think this one should be in everybody's home DVD collection.
0316172324|5.0|The Big Idea in this book is that it's possible to know something without knowing why we know. We need to accept this - and sometimes we''re better off this way. If we all took our instincts seriously we would live in a very different and better world.<br /><br />Analyzing why we think what we think or know what we know can radically change our thoughts. Often people give extremely different answers to a question when they need to explain or justify their answer - introspection can sabotage solutions.<br /><br />Our \\"Adaptive subconscious\\"\\" makes these quick decisions for us (it has nothing to do with Freud''s subconscious, The Oedipus complex, or any other such psycho-mumbojumbo). It throws away most details and concentrates on what it considers to be most important in order to make quick decisions. In general it is remarkable at making great decisions very quickly with very few facts available.<br /><br />Our subconscious can certainly make errors as well. For example, Warren Harding, perhaps the worst US President ever, \\"looked\\" presidential. Everyone thought he would make a great president based on his appearance, but apparently they were extremely wrong! Another example: US CEOs average approximately 3 inches taller than average. There is no link between CEO ability and height, but certainly an ingrained bias that tall men are leaders (or something like that).<br /><br />This is an engaging book with many well-researched examples, each of which is fascinating in it''s own right. This was a hard book to read in two days -- I wanted to read it cover to cover. It was so riveting that although I started reading it at night when both mentally and physically exhausted, I seriously considered making coffee when nodding off around midnight so I could continue reading!
B000LE1FAY|5.0|When I first heard about this project, my thought was \\"Bad idea\\". Love Belinda, but after all, she's American and has learned French somewhat late in life, and that usually means dreadful pronounciation. Besides, I wanted another pop album. <br /> <br />Then I got the album. My worries about the pronounciation weren't all wrong, my toes curl at times. But then again, Belinda's voice and French are a marriage made in heaven, so amazing that poor pronounciation easily can be ignored. And after hearing the album once, I decided that this was completely right, another pop album would not have been. And after all, a decade has passed in Belinda's release of AWAAM and she has developed since then. But so have her fans. <br /> <br />Must say that \\"Sous le ciel de Paris\\" is really charming...

B000002J1O|5.0|Genesis (especially in its early incarnation) was as good as any progressive rock outfit out there.  They could hold their own with Yes, King Crimson, and ELP.  They were closer to Yes than anybody, in terms of being an excellent group ensemble and musicianship.  Say what you will, but Phil Collins was/is an excellent drummer, very underrated as a musician.  He always gets flack from Genesis fans for \\"commericalising\\" their later music (that's not really true, but that's another debate).  This is my favorite of the early Genesis albums, with kudos going to the brilliant epics Cinema Show and Firth of Fifth.  The studio version of Firth is superior to the live one on Seconds Out, because of Bank's beautiful piano solo at the beginning.  The playing here is really tight, as tight as King Crimson in their prime.  Now I have to go play Firth of Fifth.  Those piano chords and Collins's brilliant drumming are spiralling around in my head...

B0000VD04M|4.0|I like this film a lot, but I would always think to myself, why make a film about the worst director of all time?  I always thought that it was kind of dumb to make a film about a director who couldn't direct his way out of a paper bag.  Ed Wood's films are truly wretched, but yet, they are memorable.  They are so horribly bad, yet, you remember them with fondness because they are so incompetently made.  Many directors go through their careers and are never heard from again.  They make indistinguishable films that go direct to DVD.  They make horrible made for TV movies, or they make lame commercials.  If they are seen, they are instantly forgotten.  You might think they were OK at the time, but you don't remember them with any fondness, and you can care less about the director of them.  However, you do remember Ed Wood's films.  Because of that, yes, he did deserve a film made about him.  Tim Burton takes many liberties with Ed Wood's life, making it a little happier than it actually was (the real Ed Wood died a penniless alcoholic), but I think he captures the essence of Ed Wood, and that was shameless mediocrity, brazen incompetence, and a self seriousness that made his films as hilariously bad as they were.  As for the actual film Ed Wood, it's beautifully shot, and the performances here are first rate, with Johnny Depp giving another amazing performance in arguably the most diverse career in Hollywood history.  Is there any role that Depp can't play?<br /><br />Landau deserved the Academy Award he got for playing Bela Lugosi, and the rest of the cast is excellent as well.  A great film about a wonderfully awful director....

B00005CDUE|5.0|Categorizing the magic of Roxy Music is rather difficult. They fall into some ambivalent left-of-centre area that can range from frantic glam, smooth love songs, disco grooves and experimental fervor. Having undergone such a constant and ultimately dramatic evolution, constructing a compilation that presents the ever-changing face of the band is a hard task. Various collections have tried and failed. Some of them have included material from singer Bryan Ferry's solo career. This compilation, however, sticks purely to Roxy Music and looks at the material the band released from 1972 to 1982. However, it tackles the issue of evolution in an interesting way: the tracks are presented in reverse chronological order. This logic, although somewhat puzzling at first, serves to be key in ensuring this compilation's success. <br /> <br />The music: <br /> <br />1. Avalon- From 82's \\"Avalon.\\" An incredibly smooth track, slick production, mellow and with female backing vocals. This is how the band sounded at the end of their run. <br /> <br />2. More Than This- Also from \\"Avalon,\\" but with a poppier sensibilty. Flawless production, masterfully crafted and catchy as you might hope. <br /> <br />3. Jealous Guy- Cover of a Lennon track. Subdued even compared to the the surrounding songs. <br /> <br />4. Over You- Poppy and clean, not at all obscene. A clear example of latter-day Roxy. <br /> <br />5. Same Old Scene- Things get slightly moodier on this track :) <br /> <br />6. Oh Yeah- Bland pop, and a weak spot. But then it leads us too... <br /> <br />7. Angel Eyes- Almost a throw-away disco song, if not for its infectious pulse, slightly sci-fi effects and memorably sugar-coated lyrics. <br /> <br />8. Dance Away- The softer counterpart to Angel Eyes. \\"Dance away the heartache/dance away the pain,\\" gives you an idea of the subject matter. <br /> <br />9. Both Ends Burning- Disco of a dark sort. Excellent. <br /> <br />10. Love Is The Drug- Again, disco-ish: a pulsating bass linedrives the song, which itself is a great little ditty about going out \\"to score\\" some of that \\"love\\" drug. Hanging out with the ladies of night, Bryan? Of course. <br /> <br />11. Out Of The Blue- Experimentation time. Flanger effects sweep the majority of the track, and its all the more rousing for it. Energetic and exciting are the best ways to describe the pace of this art-rock journey. <br /> <br />12. All I Want Is You- Things get a bit more conventional here, but not quite. You'll see that in many ways, this song could have been made by any 70s band but at the same time, its execution is pure Roxy Music. <br /> <br />13. Mother Of Pearl- It starts out as a fast-paced rocker, with Ferry liberally employing with idiosyncratic delivery to great effect. And the, more than a minute into the song, it collapses into a beautiful mid-tempo piano ballad. Only Roxy! <br /> <br />14. Street Life- The classic early phase starts here. Completely unforgettable, grade A track. <br /> <br />15. Do The Strand- \\"There's a new sensation\\"... it's the strand! Marvelously produced and delivery with a canny sense of fun that makes Roxy Music stick out from the pack. <br /> <br />16. Pyjamarama- The simple chords that introduce the song lead us to a song whose melodies and textures you'll never forget. <br /> <br />17. Virginia Plain- A classic, hands-down. <br /> <br />18. Re-Make/Re-Model- Back to the very beginning. Ferry's quirk and energy stand in stark contrast to the crooner we see 10 years later. The music itself is also jarringly different. It's production is hardly dated, and the music borders prog and glam. And the song structure is playful, and it gets you every time: You think its going to end, and it fools you for more than 3 minutes. One of the best songs I know. <br /> <br />So what did we see? We begun with the best make-out tracks ever and ended up with some iconoclastic musical geniuses. The compilers made an excellent choice by framing their selections in this manner. Rather than seeing a band \\"devolve,\\" \\"sell out\\" or \\"lose its edge,\\" we see a band that exchanged certain elements for others throughout a 10 year period. Once that mindset (along with the cracking tunes) is embedded in you, you'll gladly go out and seek out the albums from the period that appeal to you the most. <br /> <br />This excellent compilation is readily available, has excellent tracks, boasts great sound quality, is well assembled and is a perfect introduction to an incredible influential band.

B000MVQ9P2|5.0|While I agree with what the mentioned reviewer has stated regarding the quality of the film, it should be noted that the reviewer did not understand the political aspect of the film. <br /> <br />While the film does have a few \\"Anti-American\\" overtones, the real heart of the film lies within the social level of the lower working-class Koreans; mainly how a big event such as a monster attack, and giant political meetings in order to resolve conflicts do not matter to them, as they wish to simply move along with their lives in peace. The ending of the film shows this with many details and symbolism. <br /> <br />As the film is Korean, it would make sense that a Westerner would have some more trouble understanding the underlying commentary, as opposed to an Easterner.
0743455967|5.0|I am not a fan of Stephen King's fiction; in fact, I've never read a single one of his novels or stories. I'd like to. But given how how stylish and vivid and accessible his prose is, I know I wouldn't just read these horrors, I'd be stuck with them inside my head forever. And that I refuse to do.<br /><br />But I couldn't resist picking up this book when I read the Cleveland Plain Dealer's blurb on the back: \\"Simply the best book on writing. Ever.\\"<br /><br />I figure they know what they're talking about. And as a professional author, I'm always looking for an extra `edge', so I read lots of books on writing. Some have been helpful, others a waste of time. Nonetheless, I'm always hopeful that the next writing book I pick up will have the ultimate secrets to the craft.<br /><br />This one really did.<br /><br />This was without a doubt the best investment in a writing book or seminar that I've ever made. King has thought long and hard about writing. Though he certainly exhibits a lot of the signs of a `natural' talent, he has also honed his craft for years and has definite opinions about what works and what doesn't.<br /><br />To my great surprise, he's a writer who feels strongly about the proper use of grammar, about avoiding the passive voice at all times and adverbs wherever possible. And he talks about this at length.<br /><br />He also talks about the importance of NOT writing outlines or treatments -- that the act of creation is you and the page and spewing forth your manuscript, without going for the overview which can paralyze you (and in my case, that's exactly what it did -- how did he know?)<br /><br />I read the entire book in a few days and immediately sat down and started it again. He has a million nuggets of critical information that can literally lift you INTO the driver's seat of the writer's life -- if you want to be there.<br /><br />If you buy one book on writing, let it be this one.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Stephen King's fiction. But I sure am a fan. This book is a service to writers everywhere.e am a fan. This book is a service to writers everywhere.
1582701709|5.0|I read the book after watching the DVD, and quite frankly, if I had to make a choice between the two, I'd choose the book.  (although I loved the DVD as well)  The book is a wonderful reference tool and great reminder as to how to live your life.  I've *known* the secret for a long time, but had never put a name to it.  I've experienced what happens in my life when I live it negatively, vs. positively, and there's a HUGE difference.  The trick with *The Secret* is, it's more than just *thinking* positive thoughts.  It's BELIEVING them!  I love how it explains about your *feelings* cuz if you're feeling crappy, than of course you're thinking crappy too, and then it snowballs.  So... Ya gotta learn how to control your *feelings*, and one of the things it suggests is to make up your mind each morning, before you get out of bed, that you're going to have a good day. If you BELIEVE that, you will.  I'm buying this book for my kids and all my friends.  THey may not be ready for it right now, but when they are, they'll have the resource they need to change their lives.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|<br />I hate to be the nitpicker, but here goes. <br /> <br />I agree with everyone that this is a fantastic CD; even after only a few listens it is rapidly becoming one of my favorites.  Neil is in excellent voice:  strong, clear, ringing even, and his guitar and piano are top notch. Beautiful in fact. Songs that are so familiar and well-loved are at once old friends and new sensations.  Not an easy feat.   <br /> <br />So, what's the complaint?  The audience. They are annoying.  They break into applause in the middle of a song at the mere mention of \\"Canada\\" (hey, I love Canada, too, but please); or they applaud at the first recognition of the opening chords (OK), but then have to re-applaud the first words, too.  Cheesh!  And oh, yeah, let's applaud when Neil chastises a photographer.  I was around and old enough in '71. Were all audiences this lame? <br /> <br />Audience bashing aside, this CD is beyond essential. And I haven't even gotten to the DVD yet. I gotta go now and continue listening....

B000H0MKGK|5.0|One first play, my first Mayer CD wasn't what I expected. I had heard him play on several media occasions (with Clapton) and was so impressed with his guitar playing.  At first I missed the excellent balance between guitar and lyrics.  On second play and ever since Continuum has provided surprise and pleasure-- the balance that keeps gravity and dancing effective forces in life.  I'm not there yet, but I'm getting there.  Maybe if I just listen one more time.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|Half Nelson tells a story of the power of friendship.  Dan is an inner-city school teacher, who connects with his students.  However, outside of school, he is in a downward spiral, relying on drugs as his stimulus for living.  His student Drey, is also looking for stimulus to substain her outside of the classroom.  Drey catches Dan using at a school function, thus begins a friendship of need or enabling considering Drey is \\"in training\\" to deliver drugs to help the family income.  I wonder if her choice to sell was encouraged by the knowledge that Dan (someone she admired) was using drugs.      Dan tries to do the right thing by Drey, but the pressure is more than he can bear.  Dan stumbles and it is Drey who becomes the adult, helping him and herself to want to change.  The movie doesn't sugar-coat the ending, you leave not sure if they will succeed or not.    I had a hard time relating to Dan.  That's not to say my life is without troubles, but I could not empathize in his choice to use drugs as a means to run away.  Dealing with difficult choices makes us \\"human\\".  There is no need to be perfect.  The power to live should be the greatest drug around, over a \\"dirt nap\\", and that is what he was ultimately looking for with drugs.  I was uncomfortable watching the movie, but I attribute that to looking a life \\"wasted\\" by choice.  Dan said he wanted to reach his kids and help them to want more, well he did just that with a previous student and when it was brought to his attention, he could not remember the student.
0892818875|4.0|There are three main sections in this book. The first gives an overview of Traditional Medicine principles. The second part gives a detailed description of the most common essential oils and their effects, not like any aromatherapy book because it incorporates the Chinese Medicine principles as heating, warming, cooling, yin and yang...There is an indication on how to use the oils on some major Chinese acupuncture points.The third part deals with some ailments related to the mind ill health <br />It is a very different book indeed, and as an Aromatherapist working with cases of stress and anxiety , I am very glad to have added it to my bookshelf. <br />I already knew that the same oil work differently on different people, now I know why! <br />Thanks for Amazon,their fast delivery and their huge choice
B000MTDRKE|5.0|Incredible CD from Neal Morse. He is a true genius, to be able to crank out so much material in such a few short years. This new disc, regardless of the listener's beliefs, is mangificent. Why can't people just be taken away by the epic music? People listen to the Rolling Stones' \\"Brown Sugar\\" after all these years, surely they don't think slavery was an all right thing to do!!?  Morse has his close compatriots, the reliable, talented Randy George on bass, and the uncopyable Mike Portnoy on drums. Paul Gilbert guests on stinging lead guitar. This album is pretty much a mesh in sound and style and feel with the Transatlantic studio albums and Morse's own \\"?\\" and \\"Testimony\\" LPs. Incredible passages that shift in tone, color and time signatures. Wow, I'm floored by this recording. Without a doubt, the best rock (and Christian rock) record of 2007.  Rolling Stone can gush all they want about Fallout Boy, but Neal Morse is the real deal. This man is a musical genius.  One spin of this CD and one thinks it's a long time ago, where true musical talent and ambition ruled rock music. This is a spectacular record, and along with The Who's \\"Endless Wire\\" and The Killers' \\"Sam's Town,\\" helps make up the best three albums released in the last year. <br />It's interesting that people think it's OK for Green Day and the Dixie Chicks (both talented groups) to knock the U.S. government and all, but people, including diehard prog fans, beat up on Neal because he professes his faith.  Someone please tell me when rock music became all about the lyrics, and nothing about the music, the feel, the atmosphere of the recording. Hang in there Neal.You are doing an outstanding job as an artist and as a person with strong convictions. You sir, make me proud as a fan and fellow musician. \\"Sola Scripta\\" should be on the radio, both on the rock music stations and on Christian rock channels. There really is no rocker making better records these days.

B0002W18MU|4.0|AMERICAN V is a continuation of the arresting and emotional collaboration between Johhny Cash and Rick Rubin. Cash's singing remains a contrast between the wonderful resonance of his voice against the fragility of a man who is nearing the end of his days. This delicate balance is played against a more melodic setting than the other recordings in this series, with a lot more accompaniment to support Cash's efforts. Each one of these recordings has a value and songs that will stand with the best of this man's incredible work. If I have any complaint, it is that the selections here don't stand up to the singer. \\"A Legend in My Time\\" is a bit trite and Cash's reading of Lightfoot's \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" lacks the wistfulness that makes it work for Lightfoot. But the other songs like \\"Further on up the Road\\" via Springsteen and the trio that open the CD \\"Help Me,\\" \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down,\\" and Cash's own \\"Like the 309\\" are all more than make up for the weak points. It's a wonderful thing that at the end of such a great career Cash is so well served by these AMERICAN RECORDINGS and that his music can be appreciated by a whole new audience.
0887307280|2.0|Honestly, I was disappointed after reading this book.  I had high expectations seeing all the glowing reviews for this book, but overall it wasn't great.  By the way I listened to the audio version.<br /><br />First the good:  I really did get a lot out of one point Gerber makes.  He differentiates between the mindsets of technician, manager, and entrepreneur.  I thought this was a great thought and clarified an idea that I'd had in my head for some time.<br /><br />The bad:  Gerber seems to glorify the franchise model (not franchises themselves but the method they follow).  This is a mistake.  Franchises were an amazing revolution in the 80's and 90's but I think in 2007 it's a mistake to look at this as a model to emulate.  Moreover, franchises are a terrible first business to own in my opinion.  You can \\"be your own boss\\", but many franchise owners end up putting in 12 hour days, becoming a slave to their business.  The other thing I didn't like about this book, was that it was full of stories that were \\"cute\\" but low on valuable insights.  Ordinarily I wouldn't have a problem with this, story telling is a brilliant device and keeps the readers attention, but I realized that at the end of the book I had listened to all these stories, and had very little to take away from it.<br /><br />There are a number of great business books I've read (rich dad poor dad series, good to great, Dan Kennedy's books, Seth Godin's, the millionaire next door, John Reese's materials, etc).  But this book was certainly not one of them.  I wouldn't recommend it, and quite frankly I'm confused as to why this book is so popular.<br /><br />Brian Armstrong
0618680004|3.0|...much like the hoards of straw men Richard Dawkins knocks down in this rather self indulgent book. The God Delusion is a powerful and convincing polemic, and Dawkins has lots of fun using his powerful, playful and scientific mind to pick off a number of shibboleths of religious types: the hypocricies, fallacies, pretensions and abuses of fundamentalist Christians, Muslims, tribal religions that insist on the brutal circumcision of young women.<br /><br />Much of what Dawkins says on these issues is powerful, wide ranging, and true, and it does no harm to knock down these malevolent straw men again in a widely researched and up to date polemic (for instance, I was alarmed to discover that there is a school in Gateshead UK, near where I grew up, funded by the Blair government, that teaches Biblical creationism).<br /><br />However what I really wanted to gain from this book was not a bravura performance of knocking down established religion (I, like most people, already know of the dangers of religious trends such as those inherent in Bush's America and the Islamic world), but a hole plugging argument that lays down clearly the premises for evolution and why it is a scientific theory, not just a theory, whether physics is coming close to formulating a theory on the true cosmic origins of the Universe, and why it was that the earth happened to have the exact physical conditions, against nearly impossible odds, for life to develop.<br /><br />The key scientific chapter in the God Delusion that addresses this, sandwiched between all the sociological debunking of established religion, is Chapter 4: 'Why there almost certainly is no God'. Dawkins admits this chapter contains the central argument of his book, yet he provides little scientific sustenance for what I presume is the most likely type of person to read this book - a highly intelligent, educated person who is most likely atheist or agnostic, but perhaps hasn't yet found genuine comprehensive scientific explantions to put the possibility of some form of divine (not theistic) being to rest fully and completely.<br /><br />Dawkins tries to convince us that the intelligent design hypothesis (the argument used by 'sophisticated' theologians such as the Bishop of Oxford) is wrong, and evolution is the best crane, or 'skyhook' to bridge the gap between our limited intellects and the seeming statistical improbability of the universe (something) arising out of nothing. Evolution he skims over rapidly, including a short shrift defence of those who say it is flawed by fossil gaps. Consulting the index I notice that the process of evolution takes up only three pages of a book that is over four hundred pages long. I would have thought several more pages on the subject were necessary in such a book, given the central importance of evolution to the atheists claim. The anthropic principle, which tries to explain why the six fundamental necessary conditions for life (established Cambridge physicist Martin Rees's 'six numbers') sit in a magical goldilocks band, neither too high nor too low, to enable human life to develop. Remarkable! Why is this? As Dawkins ultimately admits, we don't know. He goes on to suggest a number of putative physical theories such as 'multiverse theory', but the real nub is that we don't know. Most super smart physicists, such as Martin Rees, admit this, and Dawkins rebukes Rees for handing over the issue to the theologians. And, of course, theologians don't know either (beyond postulating God as an explanation for all this), but nor does anyone, not even Richard Dawkins.<br /><br />And that is the fundamental problem. God's existence (or at least, some supreme being or intelligence) can never be proven, but disproving it is no easy job. There will probably always be mysteries of the unvierse that our relatively tiny human brains, advanced though they are, will never comprehend. That is why I remain a sceptic, pretty much an atheist, but always wondering at the back of my mind whether there is something more, some grand and great explanation over and above the rationalism of science, that accounts for things. Towards the end, Dawkins reconstructes Hamlet's friendly rebuke to Horatio: 'There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio, than are ever dreamt of in your philosophy' to remove the 'your', to have it mean that science, the revealed reality of things is greater than the wild speculations of philosophy. I am not sure. Science is phenomenal, but can it explain everything, really everything? I prefer Shakespeare's original. Maybe it is the case that no human, not even Richard Dawkins, can know everything there is to know about the Universe, and why we are here.k of my mind whether there is something more, some grand and great explanation over and above the rationalism of science, that accounts for things.

B00005JP97|3.0|(Samuel L Jackson) plays Lazarus, remember the biblical character who rose from the dead, an extremely religious man who is broken hearted after his wife leaves him for his own brother. Rae (Christina Ricci) is the town slut, apparently afflicted with the \\"disease\\" of uncontrollable nymphomania. Rae, after a night of hard partying and sleeping around, is beaten up and left by the roadside near Lazarus' house. Lazarus takes her in and chains her to his radiator while trying to \\"cure\\" her insatiability. Eventually, the two become friends and help each other recover from their extremes of lust and piety to become more balanced individuals. <br /> <br />To say the storyline of this movie is far fetched would be an understatement. But, then again, this film isn't trying to be realistic. Instead it's a odd combination of different elements - 70's exploitation flick, mythical parable and dark comedy - that tries to recouncile the needs of both the spirit and the flesh. <br /> <br />The acting is excellent, it's depiction of the rural South is true to life and several scenes, such as Lazarus playing in a blues club, are well executed. But somehow the whole film just never came together for me. The plot meanders off in several directions without accomplishing much and the characters often seem more like symbols for the director's \\"message\\" than real human beings. <br /> <br />Craig Brewer, who also made \\"Hustle And Flow\\", is clearly a talented filmaker. But, in this case, he seems to be trying to mix together too many different influences that don't quite work as a cohesive movie. I still give this movie credit for it's creativity and  originality, certainly it's not your typical Hollywood product. But it simply comes up short in too many aspects to make it worthy of a high recommendation. <br /> <br />

B0001WTVUW|5.0|As old as this movie is, it still gives us a perfect warning against making the mistake of never taking anything for granted.  What we may have today, may not be there tomorrow.

0743289684|5.0|Because (like too many other Westerners--particularly Americans) I had limited immediate knowledge of Islam, Ali's book provided an invaluable read.<br /><br />Born in a Somali family, she later sought political asylum in the Netherlands. Reading what experiences she had to document in order to obtain that status honestly gave me great pause for consideration. I and other Western-born feminists might have good intentions when we undertake 'campaigns' to help emancipate our 'sisters' in other countries from FGM, arranged marriages, and many other practices, but we should have wondered if our actions didn't have at least the smidge of condescending paternalism behind them.<br /><br />We were subconsciously assuming that 'our way' was the only way and 'that religion' was naturally backwards, despite (like most of America) not actually understanding Islam, particularly the positive aspects pertaining to women's status which are too conveniently overlooked by both fundamentalists and Western feminists.<br /><br />Unable to imagine having to obtain a bodyguard just because I have decided to look at my childhood religion differently, her revelation in the text is both thought provoking and sobering. Still believing that her faith is important, Ali just holds that it should be a tool for respect and equality rather than a weapon of hate and inequality.<br /><br />This book is infinitely more gripping than any campaign mass-mailing because it shows how a woman successfully and proactively controlled her own life when everything in it initially suggested that others (including older women in her homeland) were going to plan it out for her.  Requiring a critical reflection of her upbringing (including prior religious and social customs) this community activism will also transcend to other audiences and their very tough life experiences.<br /><br />Making real change requires that EVERYTHING be examined---and NOTHING be reserved!
B000MGTQ84|5.0|David Lean's \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" was envisioned to be a definitive blockbuster, epic in size, yet thought-provoking, as well (a quality often lacking in other 'big' films of the era). He succeeded brilliantly on both counts, with cinematography that captures both the mystery and harshness of the desert, Maurice Jarre's haunting score, action scenes that are riveting, and performances that are all first-rate, headed by Omar Sharif's charismatic Ali, and, in the title role, Peter O'Toole as the enigmatic title character.<br /><br />Lawrence remains a controversial figure to this day, a man of incredible abilities, yet devastating character flaws that would, in time, destroy both his credibility and his reputation. O'Toole's sensitive interpretation of the man is simply brilliant, balancing a larger-than-life ego and bravado with a confusion of who he really is, and a growing moral corruption that would eventually bring about his downfall.<br /><br />An amazing film, truly David Lean's masterpiece!

B00023B1LC|5.0|This film does a great job of putting the book on screen, with a challenging role for Matt Damon, and an appearance in an American film of the enchanting Gemran actress, Franka Potente.<br /><br />This will go down as one of Matt Damon's early best--a CIA piece of \\"behavioral software\\" short-circuted by the sight of children as he is about to perform an assasination.  The supporting cast is equally up to the task, a totally believable journey from the Meditteranean through Switzerland, France, and Paris, leading to the final confrontation between the rogue Damon and his CIA handler who must fly from Langley to meet him on a bridge in Paris.<br /><br />Potente, one of my favorite young acresses who gives a solid performance (perhaps a female equivalent of Juergen Prochnow--except she spent a high school year in the U.S.in a HOuston suburb) is enchanting as the German Marie Kreutz, trying to find any way to travel to the U.S., whom Damon meets by accident in the U.S. Embassy in Switzerland.  As she ponders aloud, \\"who pays $20,000 for a ride to Paris?\\"...as she is about to find out!<br /><br />This film shows plausible deniability and believability up to the max--a breathless intellectual cliffhanger standing alone separately from the book.<br /><br />Most highly recommended!

Even though the songs are long from a time point of view, it does not seem so when your listening to it because they have a unique way of blending different styles, rhythm, and tempos throughout a song. Their harmonies are always pleasent to listen to. Through the 70s different music styles were being experiented on by a few talented musicians (ELO, Eagles, Led Z). Yes is one of the few groups that was able to find a blend that has survived to this day. They still produce CD and perform together whereas other groups have faded into a distant memory.

Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Gwynneth Paltrow are superb, as is the surprise appearance of the serial killer in the story -- I won't name him and spoil anything for he is not identified until the final credits even though you will recognize him immediately once you finally see him towards the end of the film. The cinematography is excellent, heightening the suspense all through the film. The musical score again fits perfectly, my only complaint being sometimes it's loud enough to muffle dialog you really want to hear clearly. Other than that, a fine -- if blood-curdling -- film.

You, or at least I couldn't discover the production year in the flyer, but it doesn't matter.  The DVD is certainly worth the money.  I now know that the 2007 production is not yet available on DVD.

B000LAZDQA|3.0|I purchased this DVD sight unseen because so many people told me I had to see it.  Nay, so many people insisted that I simply HAD to own it.  It was, they implied, the most revolutionary film ever released, and the next logical step in the Progression of Cinema - the Cinema of the Future.  I'm sorry, but in the end, I was completely disappointed.<br /><br />Not that it didn't seem to have several things going for it, at least initially.  To begin with, the film opens with the most candid and realistic depiction of sex I have ever seen in a non-pornographic film, and for a few minutes I thought I was viewing something genuinely revolutionary.  And, also initially, it seemed to have a few candid and profound things to say about troubled relationships, until I figured out half-way through it that the characters in those relationships weren't really very interesting, or (with one exception) very likable, either.<br /><br />This cinematic sex-fest was immediately different from pornography in that, not only did it appear that the characters were really having sex, they seemed to be doing so in a perfectly natural manner.  That is, the opening sequence seemed inhabited by real people, none of them extremely attractive (well, not to me), engaging in sex acts that appeared quite convincing.  As anyone knows, the point of pornography is sexual titillation.  Despite claims of \\"redeeming social value\\", all pornographic films exist so that the viewer may achieve prurient satisfaction from watching fantasy sex scenes with beautiful people.  The sex in Shortbus is anything but arousing; the participants not only appear to be really having sex with each other (and I believe they actually were), the sex seemed downright mundane.  So I was immediately struck by the believability of the opening scene, including the act involving a dominatrix prostitute, and one character's self-filmed auto-fellatio.  Believe it or not, that's where reality ended, and surrealism began to seep in.<br /><br />The basic plot concerns a sex therapist named Sofia, played by the amazingly talented Sook-Yin Lee.  Ms. Lee was easily the most engaging thing about Shortbus, and her performance alone was the most enjoyable aspect of the film; she also presented the most likable character.  In the film, Sofia remarks several times that she does not want to be referred to as a sex therapist, but she prefers to be called a relationship counselor.  I kept thinking that neither her character nor the film's creators seemed to be aware that a sex therapist and a relationship counselor are not the same thing.  Anyway, Sofia is having her first session with a gay couple, James and Jamie, one of whom is a former child star and the other a former prostitute, when she inadvertently blurts out to them that she has never achieved an orgasm, despite her \\"perfect\\" relationship with her husband, Rob (who may or may not be gay himself).  In a sort of bizarre role reversal, James and Jamie suggest to Sofia that she try Shortbus.  What is Shortbus, exactly?  I spent the rest of the film trying to figure that out.<br /><br />Shortbus appears to be some sort of combination sexual workshop / voyeur's retreat / cabaret, where those who are sexually confused, no longer attracted to their partners, or otherwise sexually hung up / inhibited / you-pretty-much-name-it can go to work out their sexual problems through uninhibited sexual play with a variety of partners and fellow sufferers.  The biggest problem I had was that virtually all of the patrons of Shortbus seemed totally immersed in their own shallow worlds, endlessly crying about their sexual problems until working them out through hours of joyous, uninhibited sex.  At one early point, one character remarks how hot the gay couple is.  Aside from their youth, I didn't get what was supposed to be so hot about them, as I am generally neither into twinks nor vapid, shallow people.  I didn't find much attractive about the rest of the cast, either.<br /><br />The film takes place in New York City.  I am a gay man who has lived all my life in New York City, and I have never met people who even vaguely resemble the characters in Shortbus, nor would I want to.  I can imagine (in fact, in the wild 1970's, I have even been to) places in NYC that resemble Shortbus (if for nothing else, the wild sexual orgies reflected therein) but such places, few and far between (and now largely extinct) would have been organized and run by the Mafia purely for profit, and patronized solely by the sexually compulsive, for no other reason than the sex itself.  One would certainly not expect to find such a place filled with whole rooms of the sexually repressed, working their way to sexual health through a sort of sexual group therapy.  And the first thing I noticed about the mythical Shortbus club (if one could call it a club - I still don't know what to call it) is that it seemed to be operated entirely on someone's charity.  I never saw anyone collect an entrance fee, or discuss \\"terms of membership\\".  I kept wondering how such a multi-roomed sex orgy / cabaret / sex therapy \\"establishment\\" could exist on the Island of Manhattan virtually for free, where a hamburger and a beer is likely to set you back $[...] these days, and even then you are hustled out the door of most restaurants in less than an hour.  I got the impression that some of the inhabitants of Shortbus had been there for days, a prospect that seemed to me to be possible for the super-rich only.<br /><br />As I say, there were some aspects of the film I thought were genuinely worthwhile, mostly the comedic moments, and a few of those were genuinely funny (especially the appearance of a character clearly based on former mayor Ed Koch).  The celebrated \\"Star Spangled Banner scene\\" struck me as puerile and tasteless, and I have never been accused of being a prude.  I sure didn't enjoy it for the drama, which was strained throughout, and bordered on bad soap opera.  Soap opera with sex.  I have nothing against sex, but the soap opera-lives of the main characters were boring as could be.  At one point, I glanced at the digital readout on my DVD player, and sighed as I realized I needed to sit through this movie for another hour, never a good sign.  At the film's climax, everyone's self-absorbed problems seemed to be magically solved, and the whole cast gathered together for a good natured sing along.  As the credits started to roll, I realized with a jolt that the few minutes of entertainment I managed to glean from the proceedings were not worth the amount of time I had wasted watching the film as a whole, and I rolled my eyes as I yanked the disc from the machine and filed it on my shelf, probably never to be watched again.  Revolutionary?  Perhaps, but the lapses in logic, the extreme surrealism (especially for a film touted for its realism) and the shallowness of its main characters all contributed to my ultimate  dissatisfaction.<br /><br />I have heard nothing but great things about the director's earlier work, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, but after reading various reviews, I decided it probably wasn't for me.  Now I guess I'll never know, because there is no way I intend to subject myself to another film by John Cameron Mitchell.

B000HBK3MM|5.0|I was given this CD on last Valentine day and I thought my girlfriend had chosen another robotic pop/RnB artist such as Cassie, Amerie, Christina Milian or Ciara. In the beginning, I was reluctant to listen to it because I was expecting some generic and computerized sounds but ended up giving it a chance since it was comin from my lover... when I pressed play it was love at first sound... later on I became extremely addicted.<br /><br />It is really goods news to see that the age of young jazz singers is coming back. The music industry has been driven by artificial artists but Corrine Bailey with her delicate voice and soul brings an excellent masterpiece.  The lyrics are a reflection of her background reminiscing of her childhood memories (I'd like to, Butterfly), romantic moments (Call me when you get this, breathless, Enchantment) and sometimes it gets very emotional and extremely melancholic (Till it happens to you, Choux Pastry heart) but this album also possess joy anthems like the Grammy nominated \\"Put your records on\\" (for both Record and Song of the Year)...<br /><br />The first song that captured my spirit was \\"Trouble sleeping\\" a melancholic mid tempo cut with Corrine caught up between thinking and breathing; she tries to avoid believing she's truly in love... You will really enjoy the saxophone and trumpets behind the beautiful voice of this amazing artist. A few can deliver the same quality stuff even with a Timbaland, Kanye West or a Babyface behind their projects.<br /><br />\\"Till it happens to you\\" finds Corrine in a brokenhearted mood but trying to escape from her despair, the song evokes a relationship that turns from heaven to a nightmare. She deeply sounds so desperate until you end up believing R Kelly's rude lyrics have no space in Soul/RnB.<br />\\"Choux Pastry heart\\" is smooth jazzy cut reminiscing of Norah Jones' Come away with me. It is very important to note that Corrine Bailey wrote or co-wrote each song on this album and on this particular song she played piano, bass and she also touched those percussions, guitars on many other songs on this album... Isn't this lady a genius?<br /><br />The best moment on the album comes with a song titled \\"Breathless\\" in which Corrine falls in love with her best friend and visualizing crossing the line wondering if the friend really feels the same. We have another debate on flexible friendship here. Bailey testifies: \\"there's chemistry, energy, a synchronicity where we all alone but don't tell me you can't see what am thinking of! The trumpet, drums, acoustic guitar, soft bass in addition to her sexy soft voice makes this track the bomb!<br /><br />Some have started comparing her to Jill Scott, Norah Jones or Erykah Badu but in my opinion she's a cocktail of the three and she has in addition amazing simplicity with sweet & interesting lyrics as she explains in the track I'd like to... \\"Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from; I just like to make you see that, I desire the simple things\\".<br /><br />Another song that almost brings me to tears is: \\"Butterfly\\" where she recalls when she left her mum's shelter to experience independent life. She sings: \\"What was that you'd say, make your own mistakes, and when you're grown make sure that you remain the same; now I realize what was on your mind when I left your side like a butter fly...\\".<br /><br />This album is so perfect in all the ways and there is no song you can afford skipping as I play it from Like a star to the Jill Scottish Seasons change.<br /><br />Corrine Bailey born in Leeds (UK) to a Kittsian father and an English mother, began her musical career at school where she studied classical violin, she was at her young age obsessed with rock legends Led Zeppelin before attending the University of Leeds where she studied an English Literature degree and where she discovered jazz as well as ... saxophone player Jason Rae, who she eventually married in 2001 at age twenty-two. Her husband also plays saxophone on songs like Put your records on, Breathless, Trouble sleeping as well as flute on Seasons change.<br /><br />Now Corrine is busy trying to seduce the US market and it seems she managed to achieve this but I pray she does not try to become a pop star and hence try hard to become a Nelly Furtado or a Christina Aguilera. She's better off simple and that's why we love her.<br /><br />Overall, this is in my humble opinion the best album of 2006 and I recommend it to any person who loves soul music!eeping as well as flute on Seasons change.

B00006IUL6|4.0|Besides the absorbing detective story and the layered ethical themes, this film does a great job of portraying \\"insomnia\\".  You really get drawn into the head of detective Dormer (nice name for someone who can't sleep!) because of Pacino's excellent performance, and also because the foggy-surreal world he haunts is so numbingly real.  Your mind plays tricks on you; your reflexes are off, you feel so far-away, so disconnected...    Sometimes you feel so alone...awake by night when all the world is asleep...exhausted by day and unable to truely inhabit that world either...but then there's that calm, knowing voice of the fellow insomniac to keep you company--he understands what it's like to be so tired...and to be a killer, too.    The foggy Alaskan scenery at the beginning of the movie is the dreamy-nightmarey set-up for the chase scene, where things go terribly awry, and Dormer shoots the wrong guy. In a later scene, chasing the murderer across a river by hopping from log to log, he falls into the frigid water and can't swim up to freedom because of the logs in the way.  Cold, numb and frantic, he surfaces; he keeps fighting against fatigue until he finally gets to sleep at the end.  I liked how he faced the moral dilemna with the bright-eyed rookie cop (Hillary Swank) at the end, too.  Well, (yawn) good night, now.
B00000K2VZ|5.0|Arguably one of the best rock and blues albums in history Pearl, from start to finish, was a perfect coming-of-age release for Janis Joplin, who was just beginning to peak both critically and commercially as an artist. The quality and polished treatment of this studio album, released after Joplin's death due to a drug overdose, make one ponder how tragic the loss of Joplin was and question just what might have been.<br /><br />Very good organ and guitar arrangements are prevalent throughout, especially in the introductory track, Move Over, and the final one, namely Get It While You Can. In between are the popular favorites Me and Bobby McGee (written by Kris Kristofferson) and the a capella Mercedes Benz.<br /><br />As one listens to the other tracks that accompany, especially Cry Baby and Buried Alive in the Blues, he or she just might receive the impression that Janis was going to give what was going to be her next album an extra special treatment, both lyrically and vocally, as if it very well could be both her final and signature release. Indeed, Janis did appear to tap into a whole new dimension of artistry, somehow amalgamating the emotions of anger and sorrow and bringing them under control with pleasant overtones reflecting a newly-formed sage with a very refined perspective on life.<br /><br />Pearl, perhaps the greatest of the great from Joplin, will convince many that this one female singer will always remain a unique vocalist who will never be equaled or adequately imitated. Ironically, viewpoints parallel to those regarding Janis' vocal range have been firmly held regarding the unique guitar instrumentations thus enduring musical accomplishments of another blues artist who died at the same age, 27, during the same year, 1970, as Janis, namely Jimi Hendrix.
B000002GCT|5.0|Supertramp reached the peak of its pop greatness with this album, one that I have never tired of listening to from start to finish. It's hard to recommend any one song over another, but the super-catchiness of the semi-danceable \\"Crazy\\" and the \\"live\\" feel of \\"Put On Your Old Brown Shoes\\", as well as the upbeat optimism of \\"My Kind Of Lady\\" are all top-tier examples of great music.
B000002O51|5.0|Third Stage is an incredible instrumental and vocal CD dominated by the musical virtuosity and versatility of Tom Scholz and the incredible vocals of Brad Delp. Scholz masters guitar, keyboards, organ and other sounds while Brad Delp's voice is vintage evidenced by \\"Amanda\\", \\"To Be A Man\\" and Canta'cha Say/ Still In Love. The two disparate but longtime friends were musical and social allies based on their talents and their love for children, the homeless, vegetarianism, animal rights and other charitable causes. This album is the zenith of Scholz and Delp ! Uplifting,yearning and experimental songs prevail !

B00005JPLU|5.0|300 is visually stunning if not completely factually accurate. I think it's unfair to judge movies that are supposed to be solely for entertainment value on the basis of their historical accuracy. 300 isn't claiming to be like Braveheart or Gladiator and instead is based on a graphic novel which is based on historical fact. I think it's too easy to find fault with movies that should be enjoyed solely for their ability to captivate and entertain just because you want to quote history books. If that's the case you won't like this film. But if you want to see some fast-paced action with an incredible story behind it that will keep you interested and entertained from start to finish, 300 will work for you.<br /><br />Also, I should mention that I think this movie might just be the perfect date film. Men will be entertained by the story of guts, glory, and honor, and women will be entertained by the man candy around every turn. It's the best of both worlds.

It is flawlessly well-written and easy to read.  In this era, of politicians who point fingers, judgmental, give long-winded speeches without saying anything of value, hiding family secrets, Barack writes a candid story about himself and his family.  It is one of the best autobiography books that I have read in many years.  It is now being passed onto some close friends anxious to learn about this Presidential candidate.
0312330537|5.0|Gregory David Roberts' strongest characteristic is that he loves people. This book may be read as a 'true' story of the adventurous life of an international fugitive, of crime, of life in the slums, of real-life action/adventure, of the city of Bombay. This book may be read as a philosophy about war & violence, about love, about survival, about crime. This book may be read as a compilation of invaluable street wisdom. However, I think this book is best read as a story of people.<br /><br />If you read the 900+ pages of this book with any other expectation, there would be sections where the book might lose you. However, as the story of human nature, it is immensely rewarding at every step of the way.<br /><br />Dave has a deep appreciation, compassion, understanding, and (most of all) love for humans. That is the characteristic that makes him the human he is. Whether he talks about people he loves or hates or ignores, or of people who love him, hate him, or ignore him; his characterization of the persons, their behavior, and their inter-personal relationships is intimate, deeply romantic, and personal. The author weaves the spine-tingling story of his unique life in a way that you see the world from the perspective of each human involved. The author also demonstrates unbelieveable intellect for a person with his on-paper resume. Actually, that also holds true for many other characters in his book.<br /><br />The first half of the book may seem more fiction than fact to those who are unaquainted with the city of Bombay. As a Bombayite, though, the book is so real that it proves the phrase: sometimes fact is stranger than fiction. The first half is a must-read for all Mumbaikars.

6305736650|5.0|\\"Casablanca\\" is widely considered the classic romantic movie of all time.  Its themes of love and personal responsibility are timeless.  Its simple, straight-forward storyline has enthralled moviegoers for over half a century.<br /><br />In the French North Africa of 1942, Rick Blaine, a cynical Amercian expatriate with a shadowy past (played by Humphrey Bogart) runs the most popular bar in the City of Casablanca.  Casablanca's administrators are under the thumb of the Nazi regime that occupied France in 1940.  On the run from the Nazis come a resistance leader named Victor (played by Paul Hanreid) and his wife Ilsa (played by Ingrid Bergman).  Ilsa is Rick's ex-lover from Paris, just before the war.  The two fugitives seek safe passage to America, a passage they can only obtain from Rick Blaine.<br /><br />The world-weary Rick is disinclined to stick his neck out to assist the two fugitives, but Ilsa pays him a nocturnal visit to renew old acquintances.  She finds to her surprise that she still loves Rick and he her.  She abandons herself to his judgement with respect to her future with him and the fate of her husband.  Rick is left to choose between the love of his life and the fate of a resistance leader who may be crucial to the defeat of the Nazis, a defeat not yet visible in the dark days of 1942.  His dilemma is at the heart of this movie's enduring appeal, as Rick must balance love with personal responsibility for a larger fate.<br /><br />The movie is populated with an excellent and well-sketched cast of supporting players: a corrupt French Police Chief with a heart of gold who is Rick's best friend in Casablanca; Sam the Piano Player, who renders the classic song \\"As Time Goes by\\" to a grieving Rick Blaine; Peter Lorre as an unlucky pickpocket, and Sidney Greenstreet as a seedy deal-maker.<br /><br />Among the classic moments in the movie are Victor leading the patrons of Rick's Bar in drowning out a group of obnoxious Nazi officers with a rousing rendition of the French national anthem; Rick ordering \\"play it, Sam\\" when Sam is reluctant to play Ilsa's favorite tune; and the goodbye scene at the airport, where Rick makes his dramatic choice and must live with the consequences.<br /><br />This movie is most highly recommended to anyone with an interest in a truly classic, and entertaining, movie.them; Rick ordering \\"play it, Sam\\" when Sam is reluctant to play Ilsa's favorite tune; and the goodbye scene at the airport, where Rick makes his dramatic choice and must live with the consequences.

B00005NTJK|5.0|This album brings back so many memories, although I was born in 1970.  I was raised on my parents music and one winter day, my dad's friend brought a batch of vinyl over in a box because he was moving.  I pulled out a very aged Aqualung album (this is 1981) and out pops another record, Benefit.  What I loved about Aqualung was that it sounded like it was recorded in the 17th century (especially with all the scratches & pops), which intrigued me to no end.  Benefit, however, sounded like a younger, fresher, bigger and fatter sounding album (with hardly any scratches or pops).  I loved every song deeply and found it to be highly consistent with infinite repeated listenings.  Of course, I bought the cassette format twice. <br /> <br />I was actually pleased with the new song list, moving \\"Inside\\" toward the end & putting \\"Alive & Well...\\" in its place.  I think I like the new song order even better.  Plus the remastering job really beefs up the mix, making this album that much more potent.  Needless to say, this new CD release is an absolute must for the Tull fan and a great place to start for the uninitiated.
B00005JNEW|4.0|\\"Friday Night Lights\\", the inspiration for the 2006-2007 TV series of the same name, is an unflinchingly look at a small, economically-depressed Texas town where the only exciting event is the Friday night high school football game.  That kind of spotlight creates intense expectations for the Permian High School Football Team to succeed, causing players to make tough choices and live with the consequences.<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton does an inspiring turn as the football coach who rallies the team after a season-ending injury to a key player.  His leadership and mentoring of the team causes the players to come together and make the best of their situation and of each other.  The movie avoids a cliche ending but leaves the viewer with the sense that what the players accomplish together will be with them all their lives.<br /><br />This film is highly recommended as an excellent capture of high school sports as preparation for the challenges of adult life.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|Very enjoyable entertainment with a strong message. It is refreshing to be entertained by a movie which contains no foul language or sex. I would not even call the action violent though the children are pretty violent with their actions. If they were mine I'm not sure what would happen to them but it would most likely get me into trouble as well.   This movie makes one realize that they could be blessed with children like those in the book and movie.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|Daniel Craig shows he belongs in the role of James Bond in this tale of banking, terrorists, and betrayal.  He shows a good range of acting whether he is being the suave Secret Service agent, the tortured prisoner or the vulnerable lover.  The movie contains the requisite chase scenes, fights, villains, and love scenes and Craig is the consummate Bond in all of them.  There are not as many gadgets in this movie, nor is there the humor which permeated the earlier movies in the series, but Bond fans should still enjoy this latest in the long-running series based on the books by Ian Fleming.

My first real taste of Yes was hearing \\"Round-About\\" on my transistor radio and being blown away by it. It was all so trippy (\\"Mountains come out of the sky. And stand there.\\") that every other teenage guitar player I knew was trying to learn that opening sequence by the end of the year.<br /><br />There was so much more to Yes than \\"Round-About,\\" though. Granted, there were what became classics of prog-rock, like \\"Long Distance Run Around\\" and \\"Heart Of The Sunrise,\\" but this was also where each individual band member was giving a canvas to hang a self-portrait. Jon Anderson multitracking \\"We Have Heaven,\\" Wakeman dispensing a classical quickie with \\"Cans And Brahms,\\" bassist Chris Squire plucking \\"The Fish,\\" Bill Bruford working out \\"Five Percent For Nothing\\" and Steve Howe folkishly fingering \\"Mood For A Day.\\" Each of these was a bridge between the unified band, virtuoso show-off pieces in the days when this was not considered hubris.<br /><br />\\"Fragile\\" has it all. The Post-Sgt Pepper British band urge to keep forging ahead with classical-pop synthesis of Progressive Rock, the dynamic of a young band hitting a new peak of creativity, and a delightfully spacey cover painting by Roger Dean. The dual visions of a peaceful world with a mystical boat floating in space backed by that same planet breaking apart as the boat turns out to be an escaping ark symbolised the range of \\"Fragile.\\" Anderson's choir on high vocals and some of the instrumental solo songs were indicative of an almost new-agey aesthetic, while \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\" was an aggressive rocker that threatened to splinter at any moment.<br /><br />The remaster helps significantly on that level. The solos sound clearer than the older Atlantic issue, and the dynamics of the four band songs are much cleaner and crisp. The bonus of \\"America\\" (the Paul Simon song) is worth having (I recall hearing it on the radio as a youth), even if the rough-mix of \\"Round-About\\" could have easily stayed buried. None-the-less, \\"Fragile\\" is a landmark of 70's music, and should this kind of classic rock be your particular bag from ten true summers passed, you should order it now.cleaner and crisp.

B000IZJZLM|2.0|Sounds better than freeway traffic noises, but not much. The sad fact is that if Il Divo had never happened, each of these guys had a shot at serious work. But, thanks to the Machiavellian denizen of American Idol, they have become a commodity. Not horrible, but oh so trivial.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Slightly different in tone and details from the Series Firefly, on which it was based. This in no way deters from the film, and makes it accessible to both new viewers and fans of the Series, a ground breaking, genre-busting program that was cut down before it could begin (Curse you, FOX!). This film, Serenity, has it all: Action, Adventure, Mystery, Drama, Comedy... <br /> <br />It's unfair to just call it \\"Science Fiction\\". It's an Action-packed Comedy Drama Western-themed Science Fiction Film Noir Mystery...A MUST see!
1582701709|2.0|<br /> <br />I have been reading books about this sort of thing since the mid 80's, and while this may be a good introduction to people to whom this concept has never dawned, I am concerned by the simplistic presentation of the material. <br /> <br />The simple fact is that some things are not meant to happen, no matter how passionately we feel and believe that they might. <br /> <br />There is really no provision offered about this fact in the entire book. It tries to take something that is essentially nuanced and render it in black and white. <br /> <br />You can fiercely beleive that you are going to hit the lotto for the rest of your life and not have it happen. And this could have something to do with your karma, your life path, and also the facts that the odds are so stacked against you that it is simply unlikely, regardless of how you believe about it. <br /> <br />Given the reality that most of us were raised to believe that our thoughts are of no consequence to our life situation, the popularity of this could be a good thing, but I also fear it could lead to a lot of disappointment and feelings of inadequacy... <br />
B000001TVD|5.0|There are few bands who would take the creative chances like Funkadelic did on its 1971 album. The band's second release highlights guitarist Eddie Hazel in songs that are more avant-garde and heavy-metal in nature, with doses of psychedelia and funky grooves.<br /><br />Hazel's searing work on Maggot Brain is brilliant and arguably the finest solo put down in the studio during that guitar-laden decade in rock, with Back in Our Minds & Super Stupid equally outstanding.<br /><br />Wars of Armageddon is one fine politically-charged song, while You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks, takes aim at racism in that George Clinton kind of way. The themes in both songs unfortunately resonate as strongly in news stories today as they did in the 1970s.<br /><br />Can You Get to That is the gateway to the R&B and gospel influences that will mostly dominate future releases, while Bernie Worrell's keyboards drive Hit It and Quit It.<br /><br />What was setting the stage for the P Funk mythology - through the freedom of funk and Mother Earth - became one of the more influential releases for metal, punk and the rock/avant-garde movement led by Brian Eno & Robert Fripp (Frippertronics).<br /><br />It may not be Funkadelic at its funkiest, but it is the band stretching the boundaries of sound in one amazing album.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I have been a longtime Jane Austen convert, for as long as I can remember. \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" one of her most well-known and well-loved stories, has been brought to the screen a total of three times (prior to this new 2005 version). The previous versions were made in 1940 (with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier), 1985 (with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul), and in 1996 (with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle).<br /><br />This new version, with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfayden, is intelligent, witty and very sensuous in its adaptation. Elizabeth Bennett (Keira Knightley) is one of five daughters of the \\"have not\\" Bennett family, and her mother (Brenda Blethyn) is anxious to marry them off. Once Elizabeth encounters Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden), a man who comes from great material wealth, but who lacks a lust for life, it is clear that the unlikely pair has been brought together for a reason, bigger than the both of them.<br /><br />This is an excellent character study and social commentary, on the state of the British class system and the pursuit of true love. What's more, the actors in this film shine brightly and have great onscreen chemistry. The photography is luscious, the story is engaging, and this is definitely NOT a chick flick. I saw several men in the audience, and heard them chuckling warmly in the darkness of the movie theater. Check it out!!!
0800141660|5.0|Emma Thompson, who both starred and wrote the screenplay, and Director Ang Lee deliver a marvellous adaptation of \\"Sense and Sensibility.\\"  This romantic comedy is rich with period detail and period social mores, and acted by a well-chosen cast.<br /><br />Following the death of their father, the Dashwood sisters and their mother are thrown into financial straits, living in an austere country home and, without dowries, with poor prospects for contracting good marriages.  Emma Thompson plays oldest sister Elinor, the sensible one; a young Kate Winslet plays the romantic and impulsive middle sister Marianne. They will offer contrasting styles in courtship.  Elinor waits out the obstacles to a promising relationship with a weathly suitor (played appealingly by Hugh Grant) with almost heroic patience, while younger sister Marianne falls for a rogue, ignoring the interest of an older but caring suitor played with admirable restraint by Alan Rickman.  As with any Jane Austen novel, love and happiness face many obstacles to eventual success.<br /><br />Emma Thompson's excellent adaptation streamlines the novel down to its essentials. This movie is highly recommended to fans of the Jane Austen genre, and to viewers seeking an enjoyable period romantic comedy.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I first saw American Beauty when it came out in theaters in 1999 and left with a less-than-satisfactory understanding of what it was all about. Or maybe I knew what it was all about, but the impact of that knowledge didn't resonate then as it does now, after having viewed it on television and having aged into my early forties. It's a movie about those who abide by or are trapped by the \\"structure and discipline\\" of life, and those who manage to side-step those social structures as necessary to experience greater fulfillment and awareness of the greater beauty life has to offer, which is usually an awareness we have in our youth, but are not aware then that we are aware of it or that it will later give way to the killjoys of responsibility (i.e., stucture and discipline).     I especially like how this film moves from the comedic to the tragic.  Highly recommended.
B000E9910W|5.0|The Doobie Brothers started out life as a greasy California biker band and took their name after a fondness for getting high. That ethic led to big riff rockers like \\"China Grove\\" and \\"Long Train Runnin',\\" but was lacking in the eventual slick sophistication of Michael McDonald's urbane soul. The original 1976 \\"Best Of The Doobies\\" included songs up to \\"Taking It To The Street,\\" which meant that the number one \\"What A Fool Believes\\" was after the cut off date. This time The Doobie Brothers recognize the debut album a year before \\"Toulouse Street\\" by including one song, the acoustically flavored \\"Nobody.\\"<br /><br />Once McDonald joined, the band entered a second era and began to move more towards urban soul and Steely Dan jazz. Tom Johnston split after \\"Living On The Faultline\\" over the Doobies' new direction with Jeff Baxter and McDonald, and the resulting \\"Minute By Minute\\" bore little resemblance to the mellow hippy-vibes of \\"Rocking Down The Highway.\\"<br /><br />What this CD does is successfully chronicle both Johnston's biker bar band and McDonald's more soul dominated period. When the Doobies broke up after \\"One Step Closer,\\" it put the band on ice until a 1989 Doobie Brothers reunion that yielded \\"Cycles\\" and a hit in \\"The Doctor.\\" The band soldiered on minus McDonald, which meant that Johnston and Patrick Simmons were able to regain the steering wheel and make bar-band riff-rock once more. (Even if - IMHO - \\"Cycles\\" was pedestrian and \\"Brotherhood\\" worse, but \\"Sibling Rivalry\\" is OK.)<br /><br />For my money, this double CD rates a full star over the 1976 set by virtue of the extra songs post \\"Taking It To The Streets\\" and remastered sound. But then again, I totally lost interest in the band when they started churning out factory made classic rock like \\"The Doctor.\\" You will also get a few essential songs dropped from both single disc sets, like \\"Eyes Of Silver\\" and \\"Another Park Another Sunday\\" (the original A-Side of \\"Black Water\\"), and the two-disc set recognizes once again that \\"South City Midnight Lady\\" is one of the band's best. Short of the Rhino box-set, this is a solid representation of the Doobies.hat \\"South City Midnight Lady\\" is one of the band's best. Short of the Rhino box-set, this is a solid representation of the Doobies.

0393324818|5.0|I basically picked this book up based on reviews I read here about it. Not being an overly interested baseball fan but a stats nut I had to see what the hype was about. I DO NOT REGRET GETTING THIS BOOK. If you have only ever flirted with baseball as a potential point of interest in your life this book will make you think stronger about it. Being a stats nut and aware that baseball is a stat junkies \\"sport crack\\" watching a game still caused me to snooze after the first inning. After reading this book this is not the case as it identified how potentially deep you can go with statistics to creating a winning team full of players who are not big money players. To me it was like reading the proof of a theorem. Granted the depth is not there for the true analysis type but the overall picture is (in my opinion.) In the end it will cause me to take time out and actually watch a game or two or more and delve further in to this 2007 season. <br /> <br />Outside of baseball there are some lessons for the buisness manager and company CEO that can be applied as far as picking the right personnel for a company or project. I draw my own conclusions based on what I have read as you will.  <br /> <br />In closing, if you are a baseball fan or just want to get in to the game this is an incredible 5 star read. Michael Lewis did an awsome job to the point where I will pick up his other well known book Liar's Poker. Can't go wrong here.
0679746323|5.0|Not a quick or easy read, this is an eye-opening book. Even if only a fraction of this biography were true, Mao would till be a monster of the worst kind. Arguably, Mao was the worst, most homicidal despot of the 20th century. Certainly, Maoism is revealed here as nothing more than a ruthless scheme to keep one man in power for life. The cost was simply staggering.<br /><br />This is a study of evil, of ambition and utter ruthlessness, and, above all, a study of a world gone mad. The brutality and mandacity of Mao jump off the page. What also seems clear is that he could have been stopped at many points on his march to power. And yet those who could have stopped him failed to act, or were themselves neutralized, or became complicit.<br /><br />It's hard to read this book without reflecting on the tragedy that Maoism visited on China. The Great Leap forward and the Cultural Revolution are only the best known events. As more and more Chinese from the People's Republic move to the west, it's worth remembering that for anyone over about 35, the Cultural Revolution was an event that was lived through. Think back to what you were doing in the late 60s and early 70s, and then imagine (if you can) life in China at that time.<br /><br />Back to the book. It's huge. Plan to devote several weeks to reading it, thinking about it, talking about it. It's well worth the effort.
1400032717|5.0|Being Mom to an autistic child, I can tell you that Mark Haddon did an exceptional job in writing this book.  I cannot point to any incident that is out of character with autistic behavior.  It is often difficult to explain autistic behavior to people and after reading this book I recommend it to folks who want to understand more.<br /><br />One outstanding point in this book involves when Christopher is thought guilty by how he responds to questioning and his thought processing of the answers that he gives, after all, he does not lie.  The black and whiteness in his world (autism) is shrouded in the absence of understanding of what I call the invisible language or abstract norms of human behavior.  The exact phrasing of the questions contained elements that required an understanding of concepts not easily understood by someone who is autistic.  Therefore, Christopher's answer was technically correct, but not actually true in answer to a conundrum .  Read this book to gain valuable information on how the autistic mind processes thoughts.
0061122416|4.0|I thought it was a good book because it really showed how the world is interconnected.  There is a higher power that we are all linked to and has given us a \\"mission\\" in life.  It is just up to us to accept that mission and follow through.  It's just that most of us are either in: fear, denial, or ignorance; or maybe all of these aspects for us to really listen to what we are called to do in life.  I would recommend the book.  It's a quick read as well.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|Daniel Craig owns the role of James Bond.  Intense, dedicated, and a true 00 license holder.  While he won't supplant Sean Connery, Craig's portrayal is in some ways far superior. <br /> <br />Stripped of some previous Bond cues - Q, Moneypenny, and a plethora of gadgets most of which I miss -  a decent plot, good dialog, and \\"realistic\\" action made for an enjoyable movie. <br /> <br />I also miss the traditional \\"James Bond Theme\\", first played by Billy Strange, I believe. There is a second piece that is part and parcel of James Bond scores that is also absent.  But this soundtrack was very good and though different, still had a Bond feel to it.   <br /> <br />But did they *really* have to trash the DBS? <br /> <br />My only real complaint is not about the various licenses taken with Fleming's character, but with the production of the disk itself. I saw this movie in the theater, then wanted to buy the DVD. <br /> <br />I purchased two copies from Amazon as pre-orders.  All through the disks were very noticeable drops in volume levels.  They were short but very distracting.  These occurred in the same places on both disks, both when played on my Mac (the movie looked great on a 23\\" Apple display) and on a standalone DVD player.   <br /> <br />I'm trying to find additional reports to see if this is a bad run of pressings, or if Sony has deliberately done something to cause these defects.  I'll return both DVDs to Amazon as defective, in either case. <br /> <br />I give five stars to the movie for its entertainment and imagery, and subtract two for the audio content.  (And yet I selected *four* stars.  Go figure.)
B000NA28IE|4.0|OK, the movie cut out A LOT of the plot, characters, and time from the book.  But, every book to movie I've ever seen has done the same...Lord of the Rings, The Harry Potter Movies, The Chronicles of Narnia, on and on.  If you've read the book before you saw the movie - you're going to be disappointed.  BUT, if you go to the movie for the purpose of sheer entertainment...it's wonderful.  The special effects are good, the scenery is beautiful, and the relationship between Eragon and Sathira leaves you wanting more....the perfect way to transition into a sequel.  AND, my kids LOVED it and can't wait to have the DVD, I'm pretty sure that's what they were hoping for when they made it.
B000M4RG4C|4.0|I read the book first- although the movie gives you a more vivid description of Iwo Jima, the book gives you a better grasp of who those 6 men were. Although both kind of ruin the magic of that picture, knowing now what I didn't before. I highly recommend watching the movie for the war and imagry effect and reading the book for knowing more of these men. <br /> <br />It was just weird knowing more about those boys, then what was told in the movie- but I found myself explaining to my boyfriend more and more what was going on, why they were talking like that, what was happening, what time they were in, ect. <br /> <br />I was expecting more of a heart gripping story, like I read- but it didn't get those parts. It didn't capture it like I thought they would... but like it's said, there's only so many pages you can capture with image in two hours. <br /> <br />I recommend it none the less... it's still a very good movie.
B000NA28I4|5.0|It is always hard to take a best selling book and turn it into a movie.  Example, the Harry Potter movies.  For those who have read the book, the movie will lack some of its depth and color.  However, as a movie, it has done a really good job of taking the best of the book and turning it into a terrific fantasy adventure.  My daughter and I, who had not yet read the book when we saw the movie, loved it.  My son, who had read the books three or four times, found that the movie lacked.  The screen will never have the depth, texture and back story of a epic book, but this movie certainly did a good job of trying.  I will look forward to seeing it again and will certainly buy it on DVD.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|So glad to have added this latest piece to my growing Nora collection--and doubly glad to have added it from Amazon. As she matures her music is taking on a vastly richer quality, one in which it is becoming increasingly more inviting to get lost. Nora Jones is growing up and is finally almost old enough to sound as mature as she sounds.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This is a movie that was written by a true trekkie.  I thought it was going to make fun of Star Trek fans but there is so much love in the stereotypical characters that you know the writer loved the series. <br /> <br />This is laughed out loud, feel good fun that pays homage to the t.v. series that touched millions of lives and made them dream.
B0007P3582|1.0|Wow, I can't believe I almost considering buying this over Alicia Keys' sophomore album back when I was younger. Sure, Alicia Keys isn't as radio-friendly, offensive or \\"gangster\\" as 50 Cent, but I can easily appreciate the musicality, substance and personality of her music more than this \\"Pop-(c)rap(-tastic)\\" offering from 50 Cent. Long story short, \\"The Massacre\\", 50 Cent's multi-platinum sophomore album, is essentially a \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" remake. <br /> <br />Once again, star-studded producers (Scott Storch, Eminem, Dr. Dre, etc.), pounding beats, addictive hooks, typically narrow subject matter (misogyny, materialism, etc.) and 50 Cent's aggressive rapping delivery are back in full force. And just like before, the guests are kept to a minimum, allowing the spotlight to shine (or the darkness to fall) on 50 Cent. There's long-forgotten R&B singer Olivia (pray to God she sees some kind of stardom this year) who is employed as the sexy support hook singer on the dreadful single \\"Candy Shop\\", a shameless, Scott Storch-produced slab of sleazy come-ons relating to typical sex fantasies and 50 Cent's physical self (I'm not going in-depth, you should know what I mean); her other appearance on \\"So Amazing\\", one of many pieces of worthless filler, is no better; Jamie Foxx completely belittles his own extraordinary singing talents on \\"Build You Up\\", a cheesy, literally unbelievable, bulls**t-feeding ladies joint; and rapper Tony Yayo sounds as useless as ever on the lacklustre \\"My Toy Soldier\\". Thankfully, he strikes gold with Eminem once again on \\"Gatman & Robbin\\", which is much like \\"Patiently Waiting\\" (from his debut album) - lacking substance, but lyrically/verbally complex and sonically thrilling, partially because of Eminem's solid, haunting production. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, 50 Cent isn't much better when he's by himself either. Registering the pitiful \\"Piggy Bank\\" as a legitimate diss track is insulting in its own self; the Dr. Dre-produced \\"Outta Control\\" and the Cool & Dre-co-produced lead single \\"Disco Inferno\\" are two misogynistic club cuts that put perfectly functional, appealing beats to complete waste; and practically everything else, especially the Scott Storch-produced, Middle Eastern-inflected third single \\"Just A Lil' Bit\\", fails on nearly every level. The only solo track where 50 Cent really shines is the laid-back \\"Ryder Music\\", where Hi-Tek's R&B-leaning production works surprisingly well with 50 Cent's more laid-back flow and (partially) substantial lyrics. <br /> <br />In conclusion, 50 Cent and \\"The Massacre\\" are essentially and structurally the same - you love it or you hate it. In my case, I choose the latter, hands-down. 1 star! <br /> <br />Best Tracks: <br />\\"Gatman & Robbin\\" <br />\\"Ryder Music\\" <br />\\"Hate It Or Love It (G-Unit Remix)\\"
B000002H97|2.0|Wow, what can I say about this album that hasn't already been said? Let's start with the obvious: THIS ISN'T THRASH!!!! What were they thinking? The technicality is still kind of there on this album, but the raw speed which made their first four records so good is almost entirely missing. There are some tempo shifts, but there is not the progressive 'feel' of '...And Justice for All' or 'Master of Puppets'. Next, we have Hetfield's vocals. They're decent, but he doesn't have the rebellious, rip-your-soul-out style any more, going more for the mainstream sound. Overall, this is an OK album if you like the post-1991 era Metallica. But, if you are a thrash maniac like me, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!
B000000OTY|5.0|Very good double live cd from Peter Gabriel...what a concert it was ! <br />The sound is just perfect again, the choice of songs is almost perfect. <br />Just one exception....San Jacinto is not included on the cd but you can see and hear it on the DVD, a bit strange to have excluded this jewel from the cd.  If you have notice, you have Red Rain on the cd and not on the DVD. Anyway, this is one of the best live performance you can have.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|I loved this movie!  The profanity will turn some off, though. <br /> <br />The cast of dysfunctional characters, each with his or her own hangup, makes a cross-state ride in a VW bus hilarious.  The central theme seems to be whether to let society dictate if we are winners or losers or whether to decide for ourselves. <br /> <br />I especially like Steve Carell's turn as a suicidal gay professor and self-proclaimed \\"Country's #1 Proust Scholar\\" or some-such.

0553381350|5.0|This book is one of the best accounts of, indeed any scene, I have ever read. Wolfe, with his half academic half layman writing style, explores the men and indeed the whole phenomenon, that was the American space program in the 50ies and 60ies. In a delightful manner he gets to the heart of what makes the people involved \\"tick\\", and does a great job in bringing their feelings and through to the reader. The reader can truly emerge him/herself in this exciting world of fast planes, fast cars, hope, fear and glory.<br /><br />The only thing \\"wrong\\" with this book is that it is too short. I would've loved to see 50-75 more pages telling more about the \\"aftermath\\", as it were, but that is merely because the book was such a jolly good read to begin with. And, I must add, I'm not even interested in planes, speed or space programs or indeed American history.<br /><br />Highest possible recommendation.

B000ICLHIE|5.0|Although his latest record may not be his most accessible, Tom Waits' \\"Orphans\\" is definitely a winner. I'm a great fan of Tom Waits, and I think that his latest 3 albums prior to \\"Orphans\\" are fantastic, so I was of course brimming with joy and anticipation for the release of \\"Orphans\\".  <br /> <br />When I heard \\"Orphans\\" the first time, I was surprised. It was not at all what I expected it to be. It wasen't good, it wasen't bad, it was just different. I listened to it many times, and each time I learned something new and heard something new, discovered a new facet if you will, of this quite long album. The three CDs are all different in style and will probably not all fall in everybodys taste. Although I like them all, I favor the first, the more \\"rough\\" of the three. I think that maybe especially the third CD, which is the more experimental in style, will be hard for many non-waits fans to appreciate, whereas the second, containing all the ballads, will be the most accessible.  <br /> <br />In my humble opinion, \\"Orphans\\" is a masterpiece. Tom Waits is a very gifted musician, and I often wonder how he does it. His understanding of music, of sounds, his timing, his sense of humour and his voice... All comes to their right on this album. <br /> <br />Also this edition is worth picking up because of the beautiful booklet alone. Highest possible recommendation.
0374105235|5.0|[I'm going to pick up where L. Mattox' excellent Spotlight Review left off and attempt to answer some of her concerns about why Ishmael did what he did. I don't have a psych degree as she does but I can draw on many years of training experience with the American army.]<br /><br />Ishmael Beah is a fine writer and memoirist--an easy 5-Star. In fact his writing is so good that at times I wondered if he had a ghost writer. I decided not, recalling that this was a boy who could quote and appreciate Shakespeare at the age of twelve. He grew up in a nice village in Sierra Leone with strong family and cultural values. I'm no expert on African culture but from what I've seen, these small backwater villages have very strong behavioral values--good manners at all times, respect for elders, etc. So how could such a boy be induced to join the army, and further induced to commit atrocities in the name of patriotism, and strangest of all, take gleeful pride in those atrocities? Ishmael's memoir does a fine job of recounting the facts behind what he did but sheds little light on the why.<br /><br />I think the answer lies in the Milgram Experiment conducted in the 1960s (See Wikipedia) wherein a large group of people were made to put a large electrical shock on a test 'subject' in a sham training experiment. That so many people could do this willingly was because the test conductor kept reminding them they were not responsible. In other words, he gave them a convenient hook to hang their conscience on. And these people were adults!<br /><br />In the course of my research on my own book, I have heard a common catch-phrase among the more extreme military--American Marines and Navy SEALs. \\"I don't know about the army, but in the Marine Corps, when you get an order, you DO it! You don't question.\\" I heard almost the same thing word-for-word from a Navy SEAL I interviewed. The SEAL also pointed out that he routinely went into Langley (CIA headquarters) to get doses of mood-altering drugs. I asked him why the drugs, and he explained they helped him cope with the kinds of things he had to do--nasty things, the equal of what Ishmael did.<br /><br />The military is quite pragmatic in drafting young men for combat. A young man's moral code is only a seedling at that age, easily corrupted by the weeds of propaganda. It is relatively easy to take a young adolescent whose behavioral norm is focused on keeping his elbows off the table and not interupting the teacher in class, and exchanging those norms for 'look into his face before you cut his throat' and 'make sure you twist the bayonet before you remove it from his throat.' You simply give the young recruit a convenient hook to hang his conscience on. \\"It's for your country. It's to avenge mom and dad who were killed by rebels. It's to survive.\\"<br /><br />This metamorphosis is not too far a stretch given the recent experience that Ishmael had undergone. His village had been ranshacked by RUF rebels, his family scattered--probably murdered--and he was left to escape and evade on his own in the jungle. When his sense of anomie was at its height, he entered into an army-controlled village where he felt safe... but only for a time. When it appeared the rebels were going to overrun the village, he received Lt. Jabati's recruitment pitch, an AK-47, precious little training, and the all important dose of brown-brown. After that, he was taken to where the fighting was, where he saw his unluckier friends get shot up, and the rest was easy. The atrocities he committed became easy for him, fun even, like laser tag or capture the flag. He had witnessed numerous similar acts by the RUF rebels, and having been raised in a clannish, eye-for-an-eye Muslim community, committing like-atrocities only seemed just.<br /><br />The sad thing about Ishmael's experience is that it is so widespread. To some extent it even goes on in the American military--hence, Mai Lai, Abu Graib, and Gitmo. I would say the lesson for our military trainers is to deemphasize hate and revenge as motivators and consider putting as much time in the ethics classroom as on the rifle range. The temptation to unnecessary violence is too great in combat. There is a fine balance between doing what is needed to win/survive and doing what is a clear violation of the Geneva Code. It doesn't help when we have a vice president who publicly condones water-boarding.<br /><br />--Ejner Fulsang, author of \\"A Knavish Piece of Work\\" Aarhus Publishing 2006venge as motivators and consider putting as much time in the ethics classroom as on the rifle range.

B000JBWWRY|5.0|Peter Pan, Captain Hook, Tinkerbell, the Lost Boys and the Darling family all originated in the mind of J.M. Barrie (1860-1937) and first came to life on the London stage in 1904.  An instant success, it has been through many adaptations but has remained a staple of both stage and screen for over one hundred years, attracting such talents as Maude Adams, Jean Arthur, Boris Karloff, Mary Martin, and Cyril Ritchard.  Among the most durable interpretations is the 1953 animated version from Walt Disney.<br /><br />Walt Disney Studios broke new ground in the 1930s and early 1940s with such memorable films as SNOW WHITE, DUMBO, and FANTASIA--but World War II proved a major drain on studio resources, and it was not until the release of PETER PAN that the studio once more hit its stride: a truly remarkable flight of fancy graced with stunning art, animation, and characterization, it has since become one of the studio's \\"signature\\" films, one of the handful of animated films by which other animated films are judged.<br /><br />The story differs slightly from both the earlier and later stage and film productions, but the core remains the same.  Peter Pan, the boy who refused to grow up, visits the Darling family of late-Victorian London--and entices the children away to Never Never Land and the joys of fighting pirates, battling Indians, rolicking with the Lost Boys, and pixie dust provided (with comic ill-will) by an honest-to-goodness fairy named Tinkerbell.  And for once the restoration is indeed all it is cracked to be: the colors are the intense, jewel-like range of Technicolor, returning the film to golden warmth of its original design; the sound is almost flawless; and the bonuses offer insight into the creative process involved.<br /><br />There has been some complaint that PETER PAN contains racist overtones in its portrait of Never Never Land's Indians.  The accusation of racism has haunted Disney over the years, arising in connection with DUMBO's crows, an edit in FANTASIA designed to exclude a singularly unfortunate portrait of servile \\"Centaurettes,\\" and THE SONG OF THE SOUTH, a film the studio has done its best to sweep entirely under the rug.  Those films must be judged on their own merits, but where PETER PAN is concerned--and I speak as a person of Native American origin--the \\"Red Skins\\" are not presented in a meanspirited light; they are instead as much fairtale characters as the wonderfully imagined Tinkerbell and Captain Hook.  I suspect that most children already know that cartoon characters aren't really real, but if you worry that your own children might take it amiss there's certainly no harm in pointing out that rather obvious fact.<br /><br />Disney bonuses tend to be hit-or-miss, but in this instance they are more hit than miss.  The \\"Games and Activities\\" are rather tiresome, as is the music video \\"The Scond Star to the Right.\\"  But the behind-the-scenes features are knock-outs all the way, offering early interpretations of the story, songs that were written and later dropped, and all the rest.  The audio commentary, which includes numerous current and archival comments, is particularly informative and enjoyable.<br /><br />I am not one of these \\"Disney freaks\\" who falls all over himself with every studio release.  There are indeed Disney films, including some very famous ones, that I don't much like; there have been some \\"restored\\" releases that did not greatly impress me.  But there's no two ways about this one: this is a great restoration of a great animated film.

B000803F9K|5.0|Jeff Beck's first solo album after leaving the Yardbirds is a must have among all aspiring rock guitarists' and indeed any self-respecting classic rock fans' cd library.  The line up which includes Rod Stewart on vocals, Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones on bass and Aynsley Dunbar on drums also includes cameo appearances on various tracks by legends like Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame and Keith Moon of The Who has become a classic rock album that has stood the test of time.<br /><br />Although the master tape has some minor limitations as is evidenced in parts of \\"Beck's Bolero\\", this cd has overall been very, very well remastered resulting in a very good sound quality.  The mini-lp sleeve design isn't the best that I've seen as the cardboard is rather thin and the fit isn't great but I guess I've seen a lot worse.  The lyrics are included in an insert which also has an essay written by Charles Shaar Murray in 2005 that makes for interesting reading as well.<br /><br />What I like most about this version of the album though is that it has the very, very difficult to find bonus tracks which are not on any of Jeff Beck's non-compilation albums.  The best of these bonus tracks has to be \\"I've Been Drinking Again\\" which has a very beautiful Beck guitar solo in it with Rod Stewart doing very good vocals on it as well.  Other than alternate versions of four of the album tracks, we also get another single \\"Tallyman\\", \\"Love is Blue\\" and \\"Hi-Ho Silver Lining\\" which was a minor hit single for Jeff who does vocals on the first and third tracks mentioned above.<br /><br />I personally owe a great deal to this album as when I started out learning how to play rock guitar all those years ago, it was Jeff Beck that I chose to be my role model and I learned many of his licks and solos and hence much of the material that is on this album as well as on his Yardbird and other future albums.  I can say that if you are an aspiring rock guitarist, you can learn a great deal from the brilliant Jeff Beck.  Just listen to the great solos he does on seminal tracks like \\"Shapes of Things to Come\\" and my favourite \\"Let Me Love You\\".  Beck goes on to reach even greater heights on future albums such as \\"Blow By Blow\\" (a solo guitar masterclass) and \\"Wired\\" (another masterpiece of great guitar playing).<br /><br />Overall, this is the best version of \\"Truth\\" that is out there if you like the mini-lp sleeve replica design and especially for the great sound quality and the hard-to-find bonus tracks.<br /><br />Highly recommended!great deal from the brilliant Jeff Beck.

After reading Brian Greene's \\"Fabric of the Cosmos\\" and his earlier book on String Theory, I find that there is much to commend this view of the cosmos.  <br />I find that this vision of our reality closely resembles the one that science is currently uncovering. Although I am still somewhat skeptical about some paranormal claims, this theory helps to explain some of the paranormal phenomena I have personally experienced in my own life that the current western materialist view of our cosmos simply fails to account for.  <br />A truly fascinating and read and one that will forver change the way you see your life and your place in the universe.

B00005JPG1|4.0|After reading many of the reviews posted for this film, it probably can be safely said movie-watchers will fall into 2 categories: loved it or hated it.  Oddly enough, I am probably one of the few exceptions to that observation.  I found the film to be excellent in many respects, but I can see why many a paying-movie-goer would feel cheated or disappointed.    If you don't already know this movie is about the infamous Zodiac serial killer of northern California from the late 1960's-early 1970's, then you need to do some homework.  Even if you are only somewhat familiar with the case, I suggest you do some reading (book or web) to become more familiar with it, as I did, and that might enhance your viewing experience when watching this film.    First, this is not a serial-killer thriller.  If you are or were somehow led to believe that it was a hacker-slasher film because of the director or a preview clip, then you are going to be disappointed.  Think \\"All the President's Men\\", not \\"Saw\\", \\"Seven\\", or \\"Friday the 13th\\".  Only a few of the incidents attributed to the killer are shown on camera, and then, most of the violence is left to the imagination of the audience.  This film is more of a documentary, or docu-drama, than a neatly written story that has a beginning and ending.  As in real life, there is no ending to this film.  The case is still unsolved and occasionally gets changed to inactive status, only to be reopened at some point.  Many movie-goers may find that aspect of unfulfillment frustrating, but it's real life.  So deal.    Second, the film is very much from the book by Robert Graysmith, portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal.  It leads you down a path that unfortunately almost forces the audience to believe that a prime suspect was in fact the Zodiac killer, but because of screwed up police politics and the system they simply could not make a case stick.  This man (Arthur Leigh Allen), although a very good suspect on paper based on circumstantial evidence, was never even tried for any of the murders attributed to the Zodiac and has long since died of natural causes.  Again, an unfulfilled feeling by the time the movie ends.  (The actor playing Allen, however, does look remarkably like the real Leigh Allen.  Another gold star to David Fincher for authenticity.)    Third, although somewhat flawed, Zodiac does do a remarkable job of recreating actual people with their real names (unlike an earlier low-budget film, The Zodiac), real locations, real events pretty much as they happened.  The people involved in this case over the years, and as they are portrayed on film, is the real reason to see this movie.  It is an acting tour-de-force!  Such authenticity, not only in the locations and events, but also in who was involved and what they went through are true character studies.  To see how this case changed lives (and not for the better) through losses of reputations, jobs, marriages, and health while a small handful of people lost their physical lives is what makes the film worth seeing. Robert Downey Jr should at least get a nomination for his portrayal as San Francisco crime reporter Paul Avery.  Major kudos to the rest of the cast, too, especially Mark Ruffalo as detective Dave Toschi and Brian Cox who gets to ham it up as famous celebrity defense attorney Melvin Belli (listen for the part about him discussing his role on Star Trek as the Gorgon).    Side note of trivia: actor Philip Baker Hall is the only actor to have appeared in the 2006 film \\"The Zodiac\\" and this film, \\"Zodiac\\", although he plays 2 totally different people.    Fourth, yes, it can certainly be supported that Zodiac is too long of a film, regardless of which side of the fence you stand.  I did not realize it was almost 3 hours by the time the end credits started to roll, but then, I know a fair amount about this case and was intrigued the entire way of how each person involved acted or reacted to each bit of evidence and each twist and turn.  I think it could have been trimmed by about 15 minutes or so for the general public, but it is what it is, and I do not consider it's length to be a major flaw, only a minor one.    One final flaw I do have to mention is by using Graysmith's book as the primary source of material, the viewers are led to believe Allen was the killer.  The case is still unsolved, Allen has been removed as the prime suspect by many investigators due to contradictory physical evidence (no DNA match from the letters, no match on the fingerprint from the cab, handwriting was inconclusive, physical description does not match the man the police saw the night Paul Stine was killed, and the one known surviving victim could not say with 100% certainty it was Allen).  Hence, a greater feeling of unfulfillment by letting the audience believe that everyone involved knew Leigh Allen was the killer, they just couldn't bring him to justice.    It's a fascinating case and can draw you in much like Jack-the-Ripper has done over the centuries.  And like Jack the Ripper, many people have theories and prime suspects but the killer is never found.  David Fincher, the cast, and the rest of the crew are to be commended for their honest and riveting portrayal of a time and place that affected more lives than just the ones the Zodiac killed.  If Zodiac falls short, it is only in the expectations of its viewers.  See it or not, it's up to you.  But don't say I didn't warn you.
B000KC86F4|3.0|I am reviewing the Blu-Ray DVD.  Now to start off, I am not a fanboy of either HD-DVD or Blu-Ray.  I bought this copy hoping that it would blow me away like most of the blu-ray's that I own have done, but for some reason this comes out kind of grainy looking. Don't get me wrong though, all the detail is there it is just kind of like well...grain. It is like you are upscaling a DVD to 1080 if anyone has seen that before.  I own a 61\\" 1080P TV that is true 1080P from the HDMI input.  Only buy this used or on sale.  Also the extra features are lame.

Roger was very proper and projected a Bond that never got his hands dirty. <br />    Daniel Craig can't do an action scene in this movie without shedding blood and rolling up dry cleaning bills with impunity. Craig, like other actors who portray Bond will need two or three movies to really capture the role.

0743496728|4.0|<br />Nineteen Minutes is a riveting book.  <br /> <br />Jodi Picoult has created characters that come to life that the reader cares about. Sterling High could be anywhere, anytime, and I was as glued to the book as I was to the CNN coverage of the Columbine shooting when that occurred.  <br /> <br />Her writing has voice. Her description lets you vividly (sometimes too vividly) picture what has happened in the past, present, and will happen in the future. Without the good detective, we would not have had the book because Peter would have shot himself in the locker room and there would have been no courtroom drama. <br /> <br />That being said, I took off a star for the ending which I found disappointing. As other reviewers have noted, in real life the trial would have been moved to another city. In real life, I don't think there would have been the same \\"surprise\\" ending. Although I think the rest of the book does indeed accurately portray bullying, parents not being as proud of one sibling as another, sibling cruelty (Peter and Joey), and the cliques in the teenage world I just didn't buy the twist at the end. It didn't fit with the rest of the book for me, or I just didn't believe it would have happened.  <br /> <br />As another reviewer noted, there was some sloppy editing. Certainly, the book is well written, but there were three places in the book where the readers of the advance copies must have been asleep. One was the dog scene where Peter's age changed. Another was on page 454 where it reads, \\"She felt Alex come up behind her and slide his arm around her waist.\\" Alex should have been Patrick. The third one was earlier in the book with Alex and Patrick where the pronoun (he/she) was wrong. Tiny errors, but typographical because I'm sure Jodi didn't write them like that. <br /> <br />Prior to this book, I liked Second Glance the best.  <br /> <br />Take time to read this one and you won't be disappointed. You will think about the characters for a long time.I think we can all see people we know in the assortment. You may wonder how much bullying goes on that parents/adults just don't see. I know I do.

B00005JPLU|4.0|Nobody cares nowadays if sequences and backgrounds look real or not, but the continual use of this pale brown shade (like porridge) for skies and turf made everything sort of claustrophobic.  But my uncle said, that's the point, that their world was very tiny.<br /><br />The movie has everyone screaming their heads off when you see it in the thester (we saw it at the IMAX theater here in SF) and that's always something.  I must have missed one scene though.  We know almost from the start that the oracle (or the priests of the oracle) have been bribed by the Persians or by Dominic West to advise Leonidas not to oppose Xerxes' army.  I kept waiting and waiting for those priests to get found out.  Did that ever happen?  If not, will there be a part two, maybe call it \\"301\\" in which Lena Headey gets revenge on those ghastly old priests, hardly even human, who to satisfy their lust for young girls' flesh, took the money of the oppressor and lied thus completely subverting the sacred relationship of the oracle to man?  And also, we see Leonidas tackling the Oracle Mountain, boulders skittering away under his sandals as he climbs--why do the priests make it so hard to get up there?  How do they bring the virginal young Spartan girls up that mountainside?  Maybe there's a servant's entrance that gets you sent up quickly.<br /><br />It's a movie in which, however, if you don't look great, you're evil.  The hunchback outcast--a traitor.  Those oracle priests--traitors again.  Xerxes--pure evil, even though he does have a kind of decadent beauty a la The Crying Game guy (Jaye Davidson) who played in STARGATE (1994), the obvious referent for this character.<br /><br />Maybe the movie will lead some American boys and girls to join the Armed Services and relieve the \\"300\\" we have abandoned at our own faraway Thermopylae.  If so, shame on you Zack Snyder, there will be blood on your hands as well as you using it for your artistic satisfaction.

They find out however on the first encounter they are very attracted to one another, yet each are very devoted to their own spouses and children. They decide to soothe the attraction by meeting at the same hotel at the same time every year. The story takes place over the course of twenty five years.  <br />     I found it to be very entertaining.  My 18 year old even enjoyed it. It was fast paced and kept viewers guessing as to how each adult would age as the scenes would unfold.  I think thats why I liked it.  I grew up during this era, and can relate to many of the scenes.  Alan Alda as always, commands the audience. You absolutely feel his pain when he reveals his son  or his wife has died.  Ellen Burstyn is wonderful as she \\"grows\\" both socially and physically over the years.

0743564383|5.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls (FWTBT), is a masterpiece especially combined with Campbell Scott's superb reading. It exceeds any fiction I have ever heard or read and I have heard and read a lot.<br /><br />There are few books I have encountered that merited a second read, or in this case a second listen, the Bible being an obvious one. But after listening to FWTBT, I became interested in the little known Spanish Civil War and purchased a book about it, read it and then listened to FWTBT again. The pleasure of the experience was heightened by the contextual knowledge I now possessed. I am not suggesting you must know something about that war to enjoy this book. Quite the contrary. The book spurred the interest in the war!<br /><br />If you like words and dialogue you will find that listening to this book is like enjoying an exquisite wine or fine cigar. I highly recommend it. Don't let the fact it was written long ago about a long ago war have anything to do with your decision to buy listen to it. It is timeless.<br /><br />An awesome work, such as I have never experienced. The Master (Hemingway) read by a master in his own right (Scott).

B00003CXIP|2.0|I just don't see what all the fuss is about this film. For an 85 minute long film, I was generally bored throughout. Except for occasionally thinking what a waste River Phoenix's death was. I disagree with other reviewers that this is the best adaptation of a Stephen King book - The Green Mile is infinitely better.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned the whole coming of age thing - okay, so what? It's been done before, it'll be done again, and this will get lost. Reading all the five star reviews of this film, just seems not quite right. It's a so called 'classic', probably because it's River Phoenix, and he's now dead, sadly at only 23. But he's the only thing that kept me watching it.<br /><br />I just don't know, I bought this film for cheap, but I just wasn't fussed either way about it. River was definitely the best thing, and he surprised me how much older he looked, even though he was supposed to be playing a twelve year old. But it wasn't just his physical appearance, it was in his eyes as well, which kinda freaked me out.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this film, unless you're really into this coming of age stuff. You can see where a lot of later films got their ideas (Now & Then for example), but it just didn't appeal to me. Sorry for all you lovers of it out there.

It's true that she is no operatic powerhouse, but her vocal gifts come through in nontraditional ways and should be no less respected.  Her talent for writing and singing catchy hooks, even on ballads (which is tough for any artist to accomplish), should put her up there with the greatest acts in recorded music. <br /> <br />My biggest qualm with this album is the material that it's missing.  In lieu of the double inclusion of \\"I Want You,\\" I feel one of Madonna's strongest ballads, \\"The Look of Love\\" from the Who's That Girl soundtrack, would have been the perfect addition to this album (and as an audiophile I would've loved to own a digitally remastered version).   <br /> <br />Other dynamic material missing from this collection includes \\"Bad Girl,\\" one of the only interesting cuts from Erotica, and \\"Spanish Eyes\\" from Like a Prayer, with its noticably pained vocals.  Considering the sometimes off-key performance in \\"Oh Father\\" that still made it to the final cut, I think the weeping heights of \\"Spanish Eyes\\" would have made a more appropriate choice. <br /> <br />As an aside, this is the first CD I ever owned, so I have some bias towards it.  Santa brought it for me along with my first CD player and copies of Michael Jackson's \\"Bad\\" and \\"Thriller\\" on CD in 1995.  It was a good Christmas.  :)

B00006JU7T|1.0|I am a fan of many Al Pacino movies including all the Godfather's, Carlito's way, Scareface, Heat, and others.  I expected this movie to match the caliber of those movies but was greatly disappointed.  The movie lacks a lot of action and is extremely predictable.  To me it was extremely boring, with the main focus of the movie dealing on police corruption.  Sure it was corrupt back then but so are so many other organizations and businesses, I really do not think it was necessary to make a movie out of something that lacks exciting material, maybe the movie would of been much better as a documentary rather than a feature film that really has very little content.  The movie dragged on and on and could of been summarized in 10 minutes.
B00006FDCD|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. IT was 3 hours of excrutiating psycho babble. Every time something was close to happening, one of the individuals would give a \\"breakfast club\\" self analysis and kill any attempt at suspense. How about the cheap effects, blood in balloons, water faucets that squirt blood, the moon with a clown's face??? A good part of the first side builds a story around the bully. He is brought back to kill and is done is 15 seconds??? No explanation for many things in the plot. Total waste of time. BEWARE.
B00003CXS4|1.0|I was upset that I wasted my money on this film.  The film is extremely overrated.  At best it should have only gotten 3 stars.  I do not see what there is to like about this film.  It was not funny, the plot was stupid, everybody's running around trying to find a diamond and the movie just ends so abruptly, not a comfortable ending at all.  If you have never seen this film I highly suggest that you rent it before you buy it.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|I expected the worse case scenario when I heard Brett Ratner was taking the reins of the \\"X-Men\\" franchise, after Bryan Singer bolted to helm \\"Superman Returns\\". The end product, for me, isn't bad at all and enjoyable to watch. It's competently directed (Ratner has stated that he wanted to maintain Singer's overall vision and he has done that in terms of look and feel of the film), well-acted, and the action sequences and CGI are very well-done. The score by John Powell is superb, heroic and gives emotional weight to the film (I highly recommend the soundtrack). <br /> <br />But there are some bad sections that takes away from the movie's quality. The script seems rushed (not surprising considering that Fox greenlighted it quickly in order to make the May 26 date) and never scratches the surface of the complex moral and ethical issues presented in the storyline. The script also just tosses away some of the minor characters (such as Mystique and Cyclops) in favor of new ones (as well as giving into Halle Berry's demands for more screentime) without giving them a proper send-off. And lastly, part of the fault lies with the film's length -- sans ending credits -- the film runs just over an hour and a half long. There just isn't enough time to give the main characters depth and the storylines breathing room. Despite those flaws, \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" is entertaining and worth revisiting, provided your expectations are sufficiently lowered to that of the first film. <br /> <br />The movie is available in three flavors -- single-disc full-screen or anamorphic widescreen editions, a deluxe edition which packages the single-disc widescreen edition with a 100 page comic book and a Blu-ray edition.  <br /> <br />The single-disc edition DVD is excellent in terms of transfer quality. The 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer in on par with the previous two films -- spotless, beautiful black levels, rich colors, and wonderfully-film like from start to finish. But the audio isjust stupendous and outperforms the first two in demonstration quality. For its DVD release, the audio was mastered by Mi Casa Multimedia (the guys who also mastered the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" DVDs) in Dolby Digital 5.1 EX and DTS 6.1 ES. Either track will give your surround system a thorough workout, particularly the Danger Room Sequence and the finale at Alcatraz Prison. The track is also subtle and completely immerses the viewer even in the dialogue-driven sequences. Additionally, there are also French and Spanish  stereo dubs (none of the audio tracks cannot be switched on the fly) and optional subtitles in English or Spanish. <br /> <br />The actual extras are a mixed bag. We do get two commentaries like we did for \\"X2\\", but unfortunately both the director/writer and producer commentaries aren't substantial. We get a few production details but no real dirt on what happened behind the scenes nor any interesting production anecdotes, just congratulatory for the most part. There are also 21 deleted/extended scenes and 3 alternate endings (in anamorphic widescreen with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio) with optional commentary. Those are fun to see, but easy to see why most of them were cut/changed in the first place. We also get the teaser and theatrical trailers for \\"X3\\" as well as some trailers for other Marvel films, and that's it. Those looking for quality extras along the lines of \\"X2\\" should wait for the inevitable 2-disc double-dip set. <br /> <br />In a nice touch on the DVD engineers' part, you can skip the trailers and anti-piracy trailer with the menu button and go straight to the menu selection (you can either \\"Join the Brotherhood\\" or \\"Take A Stand\\"). The menus are animated with 5.1 surround sound, and the movie itself is divided into 24 chapters. The disc is packaged in a regular Amaray keep case with a chapter insert (provided you buy a new copy and not a used one) and a mail-in DVD rebate for this movie and other Fox titles. <br /> <br />If you liked this movie and want to buy it, the current edition out now has a stellar transfer and an okay array of extras. For the die-hard fans, better save the money and wait for the inevitable 2-disc edition (which will probably be released to coincide with the theatrical release of \\"Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer\\").
1594481938|5.0|I think Nick Hornby's writing is interesting not just because his characters are believable, but because his novels are interesting for what they do not include.  Over the years much of what I have read (and written) devotes a lot of energy to detailed descriptions of places and things to bolster the plot and characterizations.  Hornby does not rely much on this kind of exposition and still manages to tell a terrific story that relies solely on the voices of the characters to keep the reader engaged.  I admire tremendously his gift for modern first person narrative and realistic dialogue.  Also, Mr. Hornby has a way of creating characters and families with disabilities that is complex, humane, and funny all at the same time.  That a book based on the premise of suicide can be so funny and satisfying is a great testament to his skill.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|The harsh, stark world of the literary epic, Beowulf, is re-created and the story liberally re-told in this wonderful film.  As you'll read in other comments, the scenery is ruggedly beautiful, the acting good, and the tale as interesting as the original tale.  It does move at a pace that is slow for Americans, but Americans (I'm one) should slow down and get lost in the tale (have a beer while you watch it).  As you may know, Beowulf was written from a Christian perspective on a bleak, old world better left behind.  Christianity subtly pokes its head into this film without being annoying or proselytizing.  Beowulf is heroic in this film not because of his exploits, but because he gains insight into struggle between the trolls and the Danes.  There is violence, but it isn't overdone, and a couple of brief love scenes.  There is a lot of drinking beer and waiting for the troll to come!

B00063MBU8|2.0|Simple Plan are rock's true tradesman. Very little talent but through sheer hard work they have become a renowned band. All the people who flame them have to understand these guys are just trying to carve a career like you or me and guess what? they are suceeding. The fact that I'd rather eat glass than listen to it is not the point, because of their approach they will constantly improve as musicians and songwriters. For now though appreciate this album for what it is a fun album by young, uncomprising males who refused to give ground and are now reaping the benefits. Another thing I don't recommend this long Player to those who look for virtuoso singing, you are better of elsewhere. Thanks for your time.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|Usually, when everybody else says the same thing about a movie, I'm going to agree.  Plus, they're right anyway.  :D <br /> <br />Here's my problem:  No DTS audio.  This came as a surprise given how all the previous Bond films came out on DTS or were remastered in DTS and we all paid a pretty penny to purchase those.  Justifiably so, may I add.  They're great.  But I digress. <br /> <br />The lack of DTS in this release means one of two things: <br /> <br />1.  Only Blu-Ray discs will get such high treatment from now on.  Consider this a slap in the face to all of us who bought into DVD and DTS equipment, as both were sold as being high-end modern technology... <br /> <br />2.  Another DVD \\"ultimate\\" set will come out with this movie in DTS, the way it ought to be...  this isn't an atypical ploy amongst movie companies to fleece every penny and more from their respective fanbases. <br /> <br />I'm betting on #2 because, with yet another dual format duel with the high-def DVD standard, most people will refuse to upgrade until the whiny little dingdongs make up their minds and have one become THE standard.  Until then, all the movie companies will want to play games like this. <br /> <br />So I say \\"Rent this movie until the full fledged 'Ultimate' edition comes out, which will have all the sound and visual enhancements and buy it then.\\" <br /> <br />There is no reason why a movie made so recently can't include a DTS sound track.  Especially a 2-disc set. <br /> <br />Note to the Bond movie makers:   Keep Daniel Craig, keep the serious streak, you've done just about everything right with this movie and after 4 miserable, throwaway clunkers, it's really great to really have Bond back.  I may even buy the re-release with the DTS track and 28 hours of extra footage... but please have consideration; money doesn't stretch as far these days. <br /> <br />

B000MQC9H4|4.0|It's a strange thing reviewing a romantic comedy since, as a single guy, it almost defeats the purpose of a movie like this. This was meant to be rented with your significant other, dimmed lights and all, and enjoying it with just the two of you. So can the movie exist for a single person? Possibly. It'll either make you nostalgic for relationships that actually worked, or depressed that you're not in one that idyllic. It's also a bit too much of a movie but at least it's quite charming anyway. <br /> <br />Los Angeles film producer Amanda has just thrown out her cheating boyfriend and needs a break. She goes online and finds a unique site: you can swap houses for a couple weeks and you stay at their place and they stay at yours. This is attractive to Iris, England native who has unrequited love for her possessive cad of an ex-boyfriend. They swap houses and pretty soon Amanda strikes a relationship with Iris' brother Graham while Iris meets an aging screenwriting legend and meets Miles, a film composer. Both women get caught up in possible relationships with both aware that their stay isn't permanent. <br /> <br />Like in some multiple storyline films, there's always that one that you feel more interested in. For Babel, I was more compelled by the Japanese storyline than anything and the Mexico segments of Traffic were completely better than the rest. Here, I tend to get more interested in the Kate Winslet/Jack Black story simply because Winslet just feels like a more endearing character. I don't think she's ever been this adorable, however the fault comes from the relationship with Black since it develops at an almost slow burn and it just doesn't have the chemistry it needs. The Cameron Diaz/Jude Law story feels the more adult but for some reason I didn't get that drawn into it. <br /> <br />2 things bugged me about the film. One, is that there's a bit of pretentious parts in the film, as if writer/director Nancy Meyers wanted to use characters to unleash some Hollywood lowblows such as the old screenwriter (Eli Wallach) lamenting about the age that didn't have DVD, Blockbuster and cineplexes. Then there's the big one where he says outright a film has to \\"make money on the first weekend or it'll fail\\". I didn't mind the film professions some of the characters had but to be that nailing on the head just seemed out of place. The other is the length where it just feels too long for a romantic comedy. It helps build films and depth but here it feels almost unneeded. <br /> <br />I don't know if it'll work for couples since I watched it as a single guy but taken as such, it's pretty good but probably not really great.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|Long and boring movie full of un-appealling roles for its stars. Some people have praised Matt Damon's performance but the fact his he uses the exact same expression for the three hours this thing lasts. His aging makeup (as well as Jolie's) is just plain ridiculous (does anybody really believe that's how they will look in their '50s) and his son looks just about the same age as him.  With apologies for the comparison but a week ago I saw the un-ambitious and inconsequential \\"Music and Lyrics\\", that is a film that aims low and achieves what it sets to do. This one aims high and totally fails. Personally I'd rather watch the first type.
B00005JPO8|5.0|While I will try to say more about the movie than one previous reviewer who cautioned viewers to not read reviews before seeing this wonderful film, I am going to avoid giving too much detail.  Much of the joy in watching this film is in not knowing what is going to happen next.  I will merely say in regard to the story that it was not at all what I was expecting.  I won't say what I was expecting so I won't give anything away.  All I will reveal is that it is set in 1984-85 in East Berlin and concerns the surveillance of a celebrated writer by the state police who has not previously been suspected of any political disloyalty.<br /><br />Several things make this film stand out.  The script is outstanding, with lots of twists and turns and surprises.  But never do you get the sense that writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is ever being merely clever or that his intent is to build up the viewer's expectations merely to defeat them.  Rather, he is telling what is a genuinely surprising story.  Just as fine as the wonderful story, however, are the several great performances, above all that of Ulrich M&uuml;he in a magnificently understated performance as the officer in charge of the surveillance of the writer.  It is a quietly powerful performance, but even though M&uuml;he expresses only the minutest emotion throughout, we never are left wondering what he is doing or what his motives are.  It is a truly masterful job of acting.  Very nearly as good as M&uuml;he is Sebastian Koch as the writer Georg Dreyman and Martina Gedeck as his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland.  Though there are many other excellent performances as well, throughout I was constantly focused on three exceptional performances.<br /><br />The only thing negative that I can bring myself to say about this wonderful film is that I remain somewhat baffled that it won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film over PAN'S LABYRINTH.  THE LIVES OF OTHERS is unquestionably one of the best movies made in the world in 2006, but PAN'S LABYRINTH will almost certainly be recalled as the one of the foremost films of the decade.  But this has always been a category with curious results, results even more curios than those in the English language categories.  CITY OF GOD was not even nominated for Best Foreign Film in the 2004 Oscars, even though it was far and away the most acclaimed film of the year.  But I propose here that we take a more positive view of things.  Although I believe that PAN'S LABYRINTH is the more unforgettable and moving film of the two, it is wonderful that two such remarkable films were made in the same year.  At a time when American films continue to decline in quality, it was encouraging to see two foreign film that were both clearly superior to any of the five American films nominated for Best Picture.  No one who loves movies should miss this great film.de in the world in 2006, but PAN'S LABYRINTH will almost certainly be recalled as the one of the foremost films of the decade.

0312330537|5.0|In my 63 years, this is perhaps the best book I have ever read, and I'm only half way through!  The only possible exception being Dandelion Wine by Bradbury.  Shantaram is eloquent prose for a people and nation and man that steals your heart, mind and soul.  As beautiful and horrible as it is, my 63 year old female body and soul wishes it had been me.  Oh, to be so alive and connected to these beautiful people.  I am overcome.  This one I will read again and again, and I never do that!  On a rating of one to five, this is a 20!                        Judy Correllus
0205313426|5.0|I'll make it simple - if you write anything for anyone, buy this book and keep it next to your computer.<br /><br />Most writers site this as their most recommended writing guide. The original text was published by William Strunk, Jr. in 1918. E.B. White revised and republished the text in 1957. Ninety years after its first publication, the guide is still fresh and relevant.<br /><br />It's not a complete grammar or writing guide, nor is it intended to be such.  \\"Strunk & White,\\" as most writers refer to it, addresses rules of usage, principles of composition, form, commonly misused words, and an approach to style. Here's an example from the text:<br /><br />\\"Do not overwrite. Rich, ornate prose is hard to digest, generally unwholesome, and sometimes nauseating. If the sickly-sweet word, the overblown phrase are a writer's natural form of expression, as is sometimes the case, he will have to compensate for it by a show of vigor, and by writing something as meritorious as the Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.\\"
B000LXH0AE|5.0|This movie is going on my all-time best movie list. With this movie, Will Ferrell has proven that he can play serious roles other than acting being a buffon. His Golden Globe nomination for this movie is well-deserved.<br /><br />Towards the middle of the movie, the character played by Dustin Hoffman will ask, \\"Is your life a comedy or tragedy?\\" I can say this movie is both; you will laugh at the beginning but will be near tears towards the end. There were superb acting from all supporting actors -- the luminous Maggie Gyllenhaal, the always excellent Emma Thompson, and to a degree, Hoffman. The last 10 minutes of this movie is something you'll want to watch and rewatch again. It's too bad this movie received so little publicity when it came out in theatres but I'm glad I caught it on DVD.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Even if there are parts that aren't completely true to the novel, this is a great escape from reality for a while. Casting was brilliant, even in the smaller roles. Paced well, shot beautifully. Would have liked to had better extras, deleted scenes, interviews, making of. Motivated me to read the book again, I had forgotten the richness of the language. Very rarely is there a movies/series that I want to own as I don't often re-watch something but this is one that I enjoy seeing again.

0446615625|4.0|The Camel Club by David Baldacci, was my first Baldacci book.  I was thoroughly entertained.  There have been numerous writers that insert some of their own political views in their books; in fact, it is safe to say that most do.  With that said... who cares.  Seems to me that the writer of a book can write about whatever they want.  The Camel Club is a truly entertaining book with a cast of memorable and eccentric characters.  Based on the sheer fun I had reading this book; I will be working my way through the entire Baldacci collection.<br /><br />Four stars, highly recommended.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Being fairly new to the DSLR world, I'm constantly learning how to get the best out of my D50. This flash has been the most important piece to the puzzle to get the results I want. I was very frustrated when I always got the washed out look when shooting indoor photos of my newborn son. Once I learned about flash bounce and purchased the SB-4oo, I really started to get the results I was looking for. The skin tones are much more natural and it really illuminates the background and provides great fill light. Excellent purchase, a must if shooting indoor shots.
0895260131|5.0|I was one who believed Islam was a \\"Peaceful\\" religion just high jacked by crazies. After reading this book, (and a few others), I know otherwise. It is a very interesting read. I now understand more of the conflict in the middle east, why terrorist groups will not go away anytime soon, and the conflicts between Jews/Christians and Muslims has been going on from the time Muhammed started to establish Islam. (The Jews laughed at Muhammed when he said he was a profit, and when he asked them to become muslim, they told him to get bent. They have been mad ever since.) But this book was also a great history lesson about this area of the world...for those of you who like history.  <br />  <br />And in response to \\"Shoddily biased\\" <br />This book was not about how \\"1.5 billion almost-exclusively-peaceful Muslims\\" practice Islam. It is an In-depth look at Islam itself, the history and beginning of Islam, and the teachings of the Quran, Muhammed, and other muslim leaders...past and present. There is a section in this book about the peaceful muslims. Lets be thankful that the 1.5 billion are peaceful and not practicing Islam as Muhammed and the Quran intend. Everything in this book is well researched and sources given. The author is not just making uninformed blanket statements about Islam. This is not an attack on Muslims...or even Islam. Just other facts about Islam that are unknown by most Non-believers... and modern Muslims for that matter (one of the reasons there is believed to be so many \\"peaceful Muslims\\").  <br />And as far as the \\"peaceful muslims\\" go...just think of how many so called \\"Christians \\" live there life the way Jesus or the bible say to...or how many Christians actually know what most of the Bible says??...Not too many. It is the same for modern Muslims. It is the Islamic states (Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc) and Terrorist groups, who follow Islam as the founder, Muhammed, intended and lived his own life, and they also understand and live out the teachings of the Quaran.   <br /> <br />But Islam is what it is. This book does not bash, just informs. <br />

B000AYQJJ2|5.0|Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Ravi Shankar, Ringo Starr, Leon Russell, and Billy Preston unite for the good of all. There have been many great efforts by those that are gifted with special talents to bring help to those in dire need of the basic necessities of life, but before efforts like \\"We Are the World,\\" and other charitable events, George Harrison conducted a 1971 Concert for Bangladesh. By acquiring this DVD, you get the rare opportunity to witness this ground breaking great effort. The purpose for these musicians to come together was to raise money for the people of Bangladesh. The reason was that these people were living the dire consequences of war, floods, and famine. During the performance, we see the rare appearances of Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton who had been away for some time because of deep emotional challenges. Our favorite part is the bonus material, which provides the opportunity to see unreleased performances, as well as a documentary where the participants are interviewed. After seeing the performance, we researched and learned about the sitar and how it is constructed. Would highly recommend this DVD if you want to experience the outcome of a great effort transforming into a legacy of great music.
B000007O9L|4.0|Yet another live Stones album, but it's good.  Like most live albums from these guys, you get a combination of spendidly done covers (by the world's most underrated cover band) and Stones standards.  My favorites are: the grinding rendition of Street Fighting Man, the fresh delivery of Shine A Light, and the must-have pairing of iconic band with iconic title on Like A Rolling Stone.  If you are looking at this with any consideration at all, go ahead - you can't lose.  This also comes with the reassurance that even though this band really hasn't given us much new worth listening to in about 25 years, at least they haven't lost their ability to put it out on stage (at least, as of the mid-90's when this was done).
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Last night we watched Casino Royale in the company of our friends Don and Virginia McDonald. This James Bond movie introduces a new identify for Bond, one that is closer to how Ian Fleming wrote about our action hero.    Daniel Craig provides a powerful performance as the novice spy who finally becomes part of those who belong to Her Majesty's Secret Service. Some of the scenes are brutal, the action is non-stop, and the opening of the film is so incredible, that we found ourselves glued to the TV.    Daniel Craig is handsome in a rugged way, reckless and egotistical, but suave, endearing, and believable. The dialogue between James Bond and his leading lady, while in the train, shall go down in history as one of the most psychologically thrilling give-and take exchanges that serve as an introduction we have ever watched.    Not following the right sequence, Judi Dench is \\"Q\\" in this film, something that given that it is the introduction of Bond, does not follow the time line, but she is magnificent as the exasperated M, who says... \\"Bond should have the decency to defect... How I miss the cold war.\\"     The plot is just as the book ordered, and it sends our hero into his first mission, which is to surface the mastermind behind an operation that funds international terrorists. As usual with Bond movies, this film takes us from Uganda to Madagascar, then to the Bahamas, and ends in Montenegro, where James Bond finds himself confronting the enemy during a poker game where millions of dollars are at stake.    The leading lady by the name of Vesper is played by Eva Green, and she delivers a superb performance as the woman who captures Bond's heart, only to place a dagger right through it... leaving Bond so hurt that he becomes numb to emotions.     As for the gadgets, James Bond receives an Austin Martin that shall become the dream of every fan... a glove compartment filled with all the toys ever dreamed... and prepared to become the perfect emergency room.    One of thebest lines of all times by James Bond is that he likes his martinis... shaken not stirred, but here we get a twist, for when asked by a bartender how he wants his famous drink prepared... he replies.. \\"Do I look like I give a damn?\\"    When this movie was released we watched it at a local theatre, but as soon as we received the DVD from Amazon.com, as we do with all films we own in our collection, we incorporated English sub-titles for the hearing impaired and watched the film with the assurance that we would not miss a single line.    Finally, when Bond is tortured, 007 provides another line that shall go down in movie history. Let's hope you can spot it. With a terrifying climax, this movie leaves us with James Bond at his best, and the clamor for... more... more... Bond... James Bond!

He changed the game of Popular Music.  these songs made me go and get Penny Loafers and get my dance on.  these Songs reprensent a wonderful time in Music.  without Michael Jackson I wouldn't even really care about Music. he was that Cat that Made a Brother truly appreciate the Art form to the Highest form.
B00005JKGO|5.0|One of the best films ever made, and essential for every collector. The extras -- interviews with Fellini, with Anita Ekberg and Marcello Mastroianni, are slight but entertaining. Beautifully digitally re-mastered, with an extra feature showing side-by-side comparisons of the original print with the remastered work. Endlessly watchable.
B000008JI1|4.0|80s rock bands didn't have it easy in the 90s. With the overnight popularity of Nirvana and Pearl Jam, just like that, almost instantly, bands like Motley Crue, Poison, Warrant, Skid Row, etc, were suddenly completely passe.

0393327655|4.0|It is an old refrain of the compassionate humanist that religious arrogance is not only atrocious but deadly to societal health.  Harris outlines his viewpoint clearly and precisely in this easy to follow book.  To me, it attempts too much in its short pages in some portions, and it is rather annoying to seek his bibliography to clarify certain issues.  However, this book is a true conscious raiser.  I think the best way to describe the book is through a parable.<br /><br />Imagine you are going to cross a busy highway and someone told you to close your eyes and trust that you would make it across.  In order to cross, you are clearly abandoning reality and living in a fantasy world.  In this fantasy world, you are safely walking along an empty path or meadow, but in reality, you are in grave peril while you cross incoming traffic.  To Harris, religious fundamentalism acts as the blinder and pacifier to the incoming traffic.  In other words, these belief systems empower you to ignore reality and act upon your fantasy.<br /><br />Harris is tired of standing on the sidelines witnessing only a few out of a great number of people actually cross the traffic.  This book, along with his more recent text, is him screaming at the horde of people crossing into incoming traffic.  It is his call to those whom have yet stepped foot in the dangerous arena of neglecting reality and call them back to reality.  This is a recommended read for conscious awareness.

1401206905|1.0|Frank Miller continues his \\"one trick pony \\"act by giving us more style over substance nonsense. If you go to every film that Hollywood releases cause its new, then this is for you. Enjoy!
B000CNESU8|5.0|A great movie created in the 1970s which is probably more applicable today than when it was actually produced.  I not only recommend it as a must watch but also as a must own.  Watch the movie and come to grips with the fact that TV is not good for you and that you would be better off trying something most people dont do - read (or workout or play an instrument or spend time with loved ones, etc).
0783233477|5.0|Glorious Claire Forlani, superbly supported.  BUT this DVD, together with very many others, has a MAJOR DEFECT - the dialog is all too often drowned out by the background music!  Under-texts for the weak of hearing are close to an insult in that they distract. They are only acceptable for very foreign languages, certainly not for the listeners' own language.  Technically it is simple to provide two or three steps in the relative volumes of background sound/music and dialog! DO IT! DO IT!   Be ashamed for not already having done it.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|If you are looking for a great rendition of Homers tale the Iliad then dont bother with this movie.  If you are looking for an entertaining movie about warfare during the time of the Greek city states then this is right for you.  Not like many other Hollywood war movies where all the good guys live at the end and are able to defeat armies many time their size with little problem...cough...cough...Lord of the Rings.  This movie is somewhat realistic where you have the good guys as your fighting soldiers and the higher ups numb or fighting for corrupt or concealed motives (if they are actually fighting at all). The losses of warfare are apparent as some of the more noble and likable characters in the movie lose their lives.  It leaves the viewer of the movie wondering if the cost of that war was worth the sacrfices.
0060005424|5.0|Mature Clayr's have special gifts called the &lt;sight> and see the future. Not Lirael; she sees nothing. The book begins with Lirael in the doldrums. One after the other, younger Clayr's &lt;mature> until Lirael is the only unseeing Clayr. However, with the help of her trusty companion, the 'disruputable dog', Lirael sets out to become the most powerful wizard ever and makes good. That is the story.  <br /> <br />The setting is kind of dark. The villain is a most powerfull black magician and Lirael has to journey into 'death' etc.. to beat him. However, this is offset by lighthearted banter between 'the disreputable dog' and Lirael. The dog hates soap; but when when our heroine has a run-in with evil and gets dirty; dog takes soap in her jaws to our heroine. 'See how much I love you. I even bring soap to you' says dog. Ahh.. That's the kind of lighthearted banter I love. <br /> <br />I recommend this. The contrast betwwen 'dark setting' and 'lighthearted banter' is one of it's the best feature.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Japanese director Hatao Miyazaki has turned out another great animated film and Disney has made it possible for  people in English-speaking countries to enjoy this fantasy.

B0000630BT|5.0|At this point, Priest was not doing too well. Their last two albums- Turbo and Ram it Down were not taken too kindly by the majority of their fans. They were losing many hardcore metal fans due to these albums and were being labeled as sellouts. Mostly, this was due to the synths and effects added in on them, mostly Turbo. In my humble opinion, I think both are great and that the synths work well with the music. They were both exceptionally fresh listens. Many fans at this point were probably thinking, \\"This is gonna be another album with tons of effects and the experimenting will no doubt continue.\\" Well, there's never been a more untrue statement. Priest really made an extraordinary comeback with this great metal album. Completely different than the last two releases, Priest speed things up and show why they are known as the Metal Gods. They took everything to a different level with this album. British Steel, Screaming For Vengeance, and Defenders Of The Faith were all instant metal classics, but I believe Painkiller to be easily better. Not only is Painkiller Priest's fastest, most heart pounding, adrenaline filled, ball breaking album ever, but it's their best. It's mind boggling that Priest could come out with their greatest album 20+ years after they started.<br /><br />First off, there are no bad tracks on this album. Favorites include Painkiller, with an insane drum intro that really kicks off the album full of energy. Than the lightning speed guitars attack. It's probably my favorite on the album. Leather Rebel was the song that really took me by surprise. The chorus is one of the most memorable, with Rob Halford doing a vocal on top of another when he hits that, high, shrieking note he is so well known for. Nightcrawler has a dark, haunting acoustic intro that sets the mood for the rest of the song. A Touch Of Evil has an amazing chorus and great keyboards throughout. One Shot At Glory ends off the album with a great note. The music on here is probably Priest's most complex to date. The guitars on here are amazing and quicker than ever before. The drums are much different than before, changing the rythym and tempo much more often than previous releases, much much faster than before with great bouble bass drumming instead of simple, diluted, and repetitive drum playing. Rob has never sounded better in his whole career and Ian Hill does a solid job on bass. This is Priest like you've never heard em before.<br /><br />This may not be Priest in their prime or when they were at the height of their career with the media and fans, but it is their most heartfelt metal album to date. This is a must for every metalfan. Don't let this one pass you by. None can compare to the ulmitey Painkiller.ost complex to date. The guitars on here are amazing and quicker than ever before.

B000MCH5P4|4.0|Babel is a film that involved 4 interwoven stories that have effects on each life involved. Each story is related to political and racial differences, and a lot of tense drama is involved. Sounds a bit like Crash, right? Well, yeah, but these two films are on two different levels.<br /><br /> While Crash had tons of known stars in it, Babel settled with just Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett to carry the film's star quota while rendering the rest of the characters to a lot of unknown artists. A surprise to go along with this is that although Brad and Cate's characters are the center of the stories, their screentime is as equal or under the screentime of the other stories. And it worked very well.<br /><br /> After two careless kids accidentally shoot a tourist in the Morrocan desert, a series of lives are affected all around the world. From the owner of the gun who resides in Japan, to his daughter, to the babysitter of the kids of the tourist who was shot. Each life involved changes in different ways. And this leads to some intense scenes, some heartbreaking revelations, and soul-searching answers.<br /><br /> One thing that could be a downer - but for me wasn't - is the story of the gun owner's daughter, Chieko. Her story is completely disassociated from the rest of the film, but in the context of viewing the film as a anthology of personal problems and discoveries, then I think it works well.<br /><br /> I think that's appropriate. Babel is an anthology of storise about personal problems and discoveries that is centered around one object, a rifle.
B000A0GXGA|4.0|This DVD was good but it could have been great. Why not follow the lead of Cheyenne and release the series. Commentary by James Garner would also add a classic touch. James Garner WAS Maverick. Jack Kelly was simply the \\"brother.\\" Did anyone ever look better siting at a poker table than James Garner dressed in his Maverick garb? He was probably the finest tv actor of all time. Warner brothers has a gold mine in its Westerns and detective shows. Why not release 77 Sunset Strip with commentaries by all 3 leads while they are all still with us?
B000NVIXFK|2.0|The new single does sound like a Vapor Trails track but less noisy.  Noisy was in style at the time of Vapor Trails (e.g. the last Metallica album).  When a band is chasing styles that's not a good thing.  Far Cry was not good.  It reminds me of other certain Rush songs where Geddy is bleating along and you're just waiting on the riff to start again... except there's no riff!  Not good.  I bought Vapor Trails and listened to it 5 or 10 times.  It wasn't bad but clearly not their best work.  If you listen to 2112 and then the latest stuff back-to-back you'll hear how far the mighty band Rush has fallen.  More likely they've just become old and run out of ideas but not time.

032109333X|5.0|I purchased this book as a birthday present for a graduating high school student who is a big fan of Shakespeare.<br /><br />This volume has a lot to offer to both students and casual readers. In addition to very readable text of all the plays and sonnets, the fifth edition provides historical and literary context, including drawings and photos, as well as insightful essays on each of the plays. The essays include background, plot summaries and discussion of major themes and would be very useful to anyone seeing a play, especially for the first time. The helpful glossary is extensive, so the reader doesn't have to look up unfamiliar words or feel intimidated by the language. Professor Bevington's fifth edition of the Complete Works is a gem, authoritative and attractive. The birthday girl thinks so, too-- she gives it an A+.

0553296981|5.0|I read Anne Franks story for the 1st time with my 14 year old daughter.  I was amazed at the level of maturity Anne developed in her 2 years of hiding.  This was an ideal story to share with my own daughter who can now see life from the eyes of a child of similar age who is enduring horrific hardships.  At one point Anne had written about her desire to write and leave a legacy for others.  When she wrote this it was her vision of what she wanted to become and accomplish after the war.  Unfortunately she was never to survive the war, but she did leave a legacy greater than even she could have imagined.
0440238609|3.0|I think the title of the review says it all --- I was disappointed to realize while reading this generally well-written books (but they are not written in the accessible writing-styles of Tolkien, Lewis, or Rowling) that Pullman's books are far from children's literature.  Unless you're comfortable with your 11-year old being told that God is a doddering idiot, that Christianity is a \\"convincing and powerful mistake,\\" and a number of other subversive and questionable themes running throughout these books.  I'll not debate those issues here, but suffice to say, I hope most parents recognize that there are themes and issues that should be confronted by, at the very least, a mature teenager who has been presented with a variety of theological and philosophical concepts, and can recognize these novels for what they are - the thinly veiled exposition of Pullman's attack on religion.  The reader needs to be mature enough to digest these ideas, and assess them for themselves.
0374105235|5.0|Any supporter of war and violence needs to read this book. Apart from giving a clear view of the under-belly of modern war, Ishmael presents the struggles he went through and how he came out in one piece, in a very personal way. Kudos to his strength and character at that age. I highly recommend this book because it give the effect of policies and politics on one childs life. And you'll be surprised how closely you can relate to it.
B000ME5B30|1.0|When I was a child, there were alarmist reports that the earth was headed for another ice-age because global temperatures had been falling for a decade. As Britain's Channel 4 reportage \\"The Great Global Warming Swindle\\" notes CO2 lags temperature gains and losses by, on average, 800 years. Throughout history, CO2 has never been known to \\"cause\\" a global warming cycle. Proponents of the theory that humans are \\"first\\" cause for GW reluctantly admit that the CO2 to T lag is true, but CO2 exacerbates the warming with divergent feedback ... and then ultimately, somehow reverses itself ... yes it reverses itself like any cycle does. So, with that knowledge, what was the immediate cause of all of the warming and cooling cycles throughout history (cycled increases and decreases in solar activity, maybe), especially the warming, cooling and then warming cycles throughout the 1900s? Why weren't equally warm periods when Greenland wss green, wine grapes grew in abundance in England and the economies of the era appeared to prosper not catastrophic? If the cycle always reverses itself (just as the cooling cycle in the 1970s did), what is all the panic about? I have no doubt that many, if not most, in the GW industry are sincere ... but let's have a rational debate with all sides included in the debate and not dominated by the GW religious fervor that blinds reason and smothers opposing thought as though it were heresy.

The only thing missing from the reception of Big Al at the recent Academy Awards were palm fronds.  <br /> <br />Until those folks are willing to put their money where their mouths are and make the sacrifices that they are asking from the little people they are seriously undermining all of the good research and problem solving efforts that this issue demands.   <br /> <br />This movie with its emphasis on Al rather than the science that the subject demands does the viewer a great disservice. <br /> <br />Hollywood could possibly have a positive role in the debate and solution but I'm not holding my breath in anticipation that those responsible will change their ways because as we all learned long ago \\"love means never having to say you are sorry.\\"
B000003TA4|5.0|Every once in a great while, a chord is struck, and anyone alive in that moment is touched.  It does not matter whether inhuman talent or heroic dedication was involved.  But when a work of art emerges that so deeply and powerfully reflects the mood of its times, one cannot help but take notice.  This is such an album.  The Beatles sound quaint to anyone born after 1965, but when you listen carefully, with a bit of historical context, you realize what a cataclysmic event their emergence was.  Nivrana was not quite the Beatles, but they gave expression to the frustrated, wounded rage of a generation in a way that still echos decades later.  That was their fleeting their genius.  Only time will tell if their accomplishment will outlive the generation they defined.
B000EZ7ZZE|5.0|Action from start to finish and shot mostly in the dark.  DVD looked great with upconverting player, but compared to HD, this looks even better.  Richer colors and so much more detail compared to the dvd release.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|Once you get the character's lives straight and how they are all connected, the story is intriguing and has great emotional depth. When a young boy living in Morocco shoots his father's new rifle at a tour bus just to see how far it'll shoot, he wounds an American woman and sets up a whirlwind of tragic circumstances made worse by many good people making poor decisions. Each culture is unique, yet the realistic portrait of human failures connects them as human. I like the way the story shows how easily innocent accidents can be blown out of proportion and how a life can change in a second.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

B000KCHZK6|4.0|I love Norah Jones--her voice and musical arrangement is extremely appealing. Last night, though, my husband and I listened to this entire CD for our Saturday night date (a great cheap date, by the way: go choose a CD together and then listen to the whole thing, discussing each song) and I gained a whole new impression. Each song on this CD sounds much the same as the others, and I found the lyrics of only three songs to be interesting. I still love Norah, but primarily as background music.
0808515721|5.0|I first read this book in high school and absolutely adored it. Twenty years later I returned to these pages and have fresh appreciation for Hemingway's art. As a wordsmith, he had a talent like few others and it's very motivational for beginning writers to study his work. Looking at his sentences and comparing them to your own is a solid way in which to improve. It was specifically for this reason that I chose to reread The Sun Also Rises. In particular, the last 100 pages are absolutely superb, although it isn't as tight as a masterpiece like The Great Gatsby. I also found the full extent of the drinking to be rather shocking. I got rather nauseous from just turning the pages (lol). Looking back on the era of the lost generation, it's hard to believe that so many of them could confuse alcoholism with manliness or zest. That they did is regrettable, but I think it killed Ernest Hemingway.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I feel sorry for all the people that paid good money to watch this in the theater.  Watching it for the first time on dvd was totally disappointing.  Movie was long and cut up all over the place.  This director's cut is what I have been waiting for.  This one puts all the pieces back and provides it in high definition.  Lots of character development that was totally necessary to tell the story was put back in.  Video and audio quality was superb for this long a runtime.  Excellent release.  A MUST-HAVE for serious movie fanatics.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters with my family.  Both of my parents work for an intelligence agency, and we have all, to a less exaggerated degree, been living parts of this movie our whole lives.  The silence about work (they've adapted to talking about the people at their jobs rather than the work itself, a good compromise), the quiet phone calls, the gravity of the jobs are all very apparent to the four (sister included) of us.  That alone would have made the movie for me if I had seen it alone, but with the two of them quietly remarking on things the whole way through (\\"We used to have burn bins exactly like that!\\"  \\"He should have crushed the paper he burned; just throwing it in the can leaves it able to be constructed.\\") was absolutely delightful. <br /> <br />That said, it was incredibly long, but I think it made up for it by being delicious the whole way through.  The script was alright at its worst points and brilliant at its best.  The ending is wonderfully satisfying -- I was worried that they were going to cut to credits after the CIA & God thing, but the letter scene that followed immediately afterwards was to die for.  If you see this movie for no other reason, see it for that ending letter scene. <br /> <br />I'm pretty picky about movies, but this one earned its five stars.  If you're going to see it because you like typical spy movies, maybe you'll be disappointed.  If you're a drama fan or if you have a special place in your heart for broken people or if you're actually in any way involved with the intelligence community yourself, I'm not sure why this isn't already in your cart.  This movie was great for all the right reasons.
B000KRNCYY|1.0|At the 3/17/07 St. Patrick's Day Parade televised by NBC, this group sang very pleasantly, but Bobby Darin's classic \\"Somewhere, Beyond the Sea\\" is hardly Irish.  They weren't satirizing the average parade-goer's ignorance either; they were just as clue-less.  If you are not interested in authenticity, and are nostalgic for 50s doo-wop, this a cappella group is very agreeable elevator music.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|Plot line too contrived to be realistic; While timelines are always concurrently multi-faceted this one was just too much.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|Syriana is my favourite film  I've heard many complaints about the liberal slant to this film, although it really wasn't that offensive, even as a conservative.  The storytelling is intelligent, and the plot makes you ask questions.  It's just fiction, but it's not that unbelievable. <br />The storytelling reminds me a lot of another Steven Gaghan film \\"Traffic\\" and also is similar to \\"The Constant Gardener\\".  If you liked those films, you'll like this one.  Plus it has George Clooney and Matt Damon in it.

B000KX0IOK|5.0|Half Nelson begins with a whole lot of alarms going off.  It opens with an insistent clock radio, buzzing inside a sparely-furnished apartment.  The first internal shot of a Brooklyn school also features an alarm bell blaring in the background.  And our first glimpse of teacher Dan Dunne's disheveled appearance (both at home and at work) is in itself alarming.<br /><br />You might think these signals serve as some kind of warning for the events to follow.  And you would be right, to a point.  For while the cinematic ride that ensues is bound to set off all kinds of internal warnings in the viewer, as it edges quite close to crossing some very-uncomfortable lines, the movie itself is so good that it left me feeling wide awake and strangely refreshed - alarming though it may be.<br /><br />The film, whose title is (according to the filmmakers' commentary) a \\"metaphor for being caught in an uncomfortable position and trying to get out of it,\\" features two main characters who are thusly bound, both striving to - if not break free - at least achieve a more manageable level of comfort inside of their strangling situations.<br /><br />There's the aforementioned Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling, in his second Oscar-worthy performance along with his role in \\"The Believer\\"), the wry, self-defeated, likeable but oh-so-very-flawed teacher who wants to change the world while not being able to change himself.  And there's the shy but defiant, independent, fiercely-intelligent Drey (in a strikingly real performance by first-time actress Shareeka Epps, who deserved an Oscar Nomination far more than Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin ever did), attempting to negotiate her way through an obstacle-filled life maze of inner city circumstances (i.e. absentee father, mother never home, brother in prison, and drug dealers offering ways out).<br /><br />Though they're both loners at heart, they forge a bond from an unorthodox yet catalyzing moment, when Drey catches Dan doing drugs in the school bathroom.  In an extended, mostly dialog-free scene that lets the audience really soak in the discomfort of the moment, Drey begins to tend to Dan as he cannot tend to himself.  And when Dan finally feels well enough to ask his student, \\"Can you help me up?\\" this innocent-seeming request really sets the stage for the rest of the film, as we see whether their unusual alliance can indeed serve to help Dan up and out of his downward spiral.<br /><br />Besides the unparalleled acting, in my estimation this film rises above almost all other 2006 movie offerings for two reasons: the writing and the editing.  Or maybe in this case I should say the lack of writing.  Because this is one of those films where the acting is so good that there's no need for a lot of expositional dialog (which is my least favorite kind).  So the actors in this case say a lot more about their histories and relationships with their eyes, faces and postures than they ever could with their words.  I find this to be a rare state of affairs in movies (especially American film) these days and so it is to be treasured whenever I find it.<br /><br />And the editing is smart enough to follow suit and take its cues from the streamlined, non-verbal exposition.  Thus, this masterfully-edited film has many scenes which cut away sooner than a more conventional film would, trusting the audience to fill in the blanks themselves rather than spelling the situation out for them.  This really helps to keep a film without a lot of plotting from becoming too plodding.<br /><br />Half Nelson was one of my favorite movies of 2006, but the DVD is actually even better due to the insightful and engaging commentary provided by writer/director Ryan Fleck and writer/editor/producer Anna Boden.  That makes this DVD a definite must own, even if the other features are somewhat lacking (6 minutes of only mildly-amusing outtakes, 4 minutes of wisely-deleted scenes, and 4 extended scenes that can't be played all at once and have to be chosen individually.  Plus a music video which I found to be rather extraneous).<br /><br />Finally, a note of caution: if you rely on closed-captioning, the English subtitles are horrible.  Any time someone new speaks or something new is said, the previous sentence disappears from the screen, oftentimes in a split second.  So approach this one with caution if you're hard of hearing.  But that is my only word of warning for this otherwise outstanding film and DVD.found to be rather extraneous).

B000008LOV|5.0|Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 was recorded and released in 1988 to enormous commercial success and critical acclaim.<br /><br />HOW THE TRAVELING WILBURYS WAS CREATED<br />The beauty of the Traveling Wilburys was the total spontaneity of its creation as a Rock 'N Roll Supergroup. Back in 1988, George Harrison of Beatles fame was working on his album 'Cloud Nine' with co-writer and producer, Jeff Lynne of E.L.O. Harrison and Lynne had been working on 'Cloud Nine' for 5 years and were finishing up the album. Warner Bros. asked for a B-side to accompany George Harrison's 'This is Love' single and wanted it quickly. George decided to write a new song with Lynne's help but his guitar was at Tom Petty's house. Jeff Lynne had also been working with Tom Petty and they invited Petty to come along for the ride and assist on the song. Lynne had also been putting off his work on Roy Orbison's new album, so he and George took Roy to lunch where they discussed doing the new song with Tom Petty. Orbison then volunteered to sing on the new track. Since they needed a studio in such a short time, George called up his buddy, Bob Dylan to see if they could use his garage studio. Dylan obliged and ended up sitting in with the motley crew. These five Rock 'N Roll legends ended up sitting around picking guitars and wrote a catchy tune that they all liked and named it after a box in Dylan's garage titled 'Handle with Care'.<br /><br />The music and lyrics came so easy for the Traveling Wilburys and they all loved working together so much that Harrison, Dylan, Petty, and Lynne agreed that they should try to complete an album. The needed to overcome two [2] challenges: 1. Dylan was leaving in 10 days on tour; 2. they needed to convince Roy Orbison to join them. Thus, Harrison, Dylan, Petty, and Lynne drove up to Anaheim to Roy Orbison's concert and reportedly George Harrison got on his knees after the concert to recruit Roy Oribson. Roy readily agreed.<br /><br />With Harrison having the greatest claim to the band, he signed them up to Warner Bros. Records, his current label, and incorporated their own Wilbury Records label, in addition to producing the sessions with Lynne that spring.<br /><br />In October 1988, Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 was released, preceded by 'Handle with Care' as the lead single that scaled the pop charts at US #15, the album reached #16 in the UK and an impressive #3 in the US. With over 40 weeks on the charts, the album was later certified double-platinum.  While Harrison and Petty had had recent successes, Dylan, Orbison and Lynne had not seen an album climb that high in several years. At the time, no Dylan album had ever achieved two million in sales. As one critic put it, the Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 was \\"one of the great commercial coups of the decade.\\"<br /><br />Most critics said the Traveling Wilburys's modest ambitions were fresh and relaxing. During 1989 and 1990 the album won many accolades, not least a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.<br /><br />Tragically, Roy Orbison suddenly died of a heart attack in December 1988, surprising much of the music industry and press. The sleeve cover for \\"End Of The Line\\", the group's second single, was photographed four [4] days after Orbison's death. Depicting a guitar in Orbison's rocking chair, it was taken as a tribute. As for Orbison, this album was released at the same time as his Mystery Girl album in 1989, and both their success made Orbison one of two singers (Elvis Presley being the other) to have two albums both reach the charts posthumously.<br /><br />Both Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 and its unexpected 1990 follow-up Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3 were deleted in the mid-1990's with rights reverting to Harrison and his estate after his 2001 death. With all of his solo catalogue having reverted to EMI after almost twenty years with Warner Bros. Records, who distributed his Dark Horse Records label, both Traveling Wilburys albums appear set to be re-issued throughEMI. Tom Petty was recently quoted to have said that they would be re-released in late 2005, though nothing, as of December 2006, has come of these claims.<br /><br />HOW THE TRAVELING WILBURYS GOT THEIR NAME<br />Jeff Lynne and George Harrison had been referring to the recording gremlins and glitches as Wilburys, referring to after recording editing of \\"we'll bury them\\" in the mixing.

B000MGUZM0|5.0|Win Butler did an interview with the Onion, where he goes through the obligatory pop culture references, details about the recording process, and statements of political dissatisfaction, before he gets to talking about the one wonderful truth of Arcade Fire's music, the Hope. Once there, he tells us what informs his thinking on its creation:<br />  Everyone in our society's separation from a real sense of purpose.<br /><br />This lack of meaning gives us a moral lassitude that encourages sniping and negativity over hope and a search for real concrete solutions. Win Butler isn't going to think out these problems all on his own, and it is true that his lyrics on Neon Bible are laid on with broad strokes. But Arcade Fire is out there fighting for meaning (like Wilco, Flaming Lips, Modest Mouse, and The Thermals)and they do give us hope. And I'm glad that Win says what he does, it may not be revolutionary but we need more people out there saying that,<br /><br />\\"Actual patriotism has to do with loving a place enough to try and improve it.... You've got to fight it.\\"<br /><br />Here is the pertinent part of the interview in Win's words:<br /><br />Whenever you're talking about meaning, basically...

B000ELJBAA|4.0|unlike mr gilmour's other two solo efforts, which more favor the tone of \\"dark side of the moon,\\" this 1984 release has more of a \\"the wall\\" vibe to it, with heavy synthesizers, keyboard work, and organ coloring the whole affair. which ever you prefer, all three of his albums are a must for fans of pink floyd. the highlight on this record, i feel, is the great instrumental \\"let's get metaphysical,\\" which has an anthem like feel to it. \\"murder,\\" is another standout track, which starts out as a ballad, then breaks out into guitar fireworks at the end. \\"blue light,\\" with pronounced synthesizers and horns is also a powerful track. the whole thing is wonderfully done, actually. you can't go wrong with this if you are a fan of floyd, or classic rock in general. <br />
B0000844I8|4.0|The movie that started it all ... a great TV series that I've looked forward to for years ... all started here ... blending two of my favorite interests ... pseudo-archaeology and sci fi.

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|My faith has been restored in American rock with this release.  Being in my forties, I have loved all the great rock and roll from each decade from the 60's to 00's.  Lately though, with the rise of hip hop influencing the American charts to the point of saturation, I had turned to England for my appetite of good rock music.  Kids, I do not know what classifies a band as emo or punk, but I know a great straight on rock record when I hear one.  A great rock cd is one that makes you feel, makes you think, effects you, and makes you feel joyous to be alive.    <br />\\"The Black Parade\\" does this. <br /> <br />Thank you My Chemical Romance for beleiving in yourself, your talent has grown ten fold on this release.   I look forward to seeing you grow as a band, and can't wait to see what you come up with next.  This release has made me beleive in American rock again.  If \\"your father asked you to be the savior\\", I am asking you to be the savior of American rock.  We need some new heroes.
1401206905|5.0|If you'd ask me, this one tops all other Batman stories I've read so far. Of course there's the excellent `The Long Halloween' which is no less than amazing, but it lacks something - it's too much to the style.  <br />This story portrays Batman first year, or, even  more to the point - a very specific part of his first year in the costume, and how he came to be The Batman. And it does this beautifully through the eyes of Commissioner Gordon, who just came to Gotham, and then only through our hero's eyes. So what we get is not only how the world around Batman sees him, but we get the same thoughts we once did when we really thought about - what is Batman all about. We get Batman from a place rarely explored in the DC Universe - we see what stands behind Batman for the reader and moreover - he is not the bright detective who does no mistakes.  <br />The art is one of the most fitting and beautiful in concept I've seen in the mainstream genre, while all tend to blazing our eyes with tricks this one is simply and dark - just as a Batman story should be, with the twisted and sick darkness here and there.  <br /> <br />I love the artwork. I love the tale. I see it as one of the best.  <br />
B000F48CD8|4.0|i love the white stripes, love the greenhornes, and love bredan benson's album \\"lapalco,\\" however; when i heard about this album involving all three outfits, i, for some reason, was indifferent. was not going to get the thing. call me kooky. but then i saw that mojo magazine (my all-time favorite rock magazine) picked this as the best album of 2006, and \\"Q\\" magazine selected it as the 13th best album of the year. so okay, i better get it. and i did. and good thing i did, too. it's a fantastic contemporary rock album. surprisingly, given the history of the stripes and greenhornes, there is little to no blues or garage rock here. just loads of good old rock. \\"broken boy soldier,\\" is a led zepplinish rocker, \\"level\\" and \\"blue veins\\" most sound like something from the last white stripes album, while  \\"store bought bones\\" is a fantastic psychedelia rocker. \\"yellow sun\\" sounds like a modern small faces number. \\"together\\" is a terrific ballad. \\"call it a day,\\" is the only mediocre track on the disc. all else is choice material. very glad i came around on purchasing this. now i look forward to more from this same outfit of fine musicians.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|This is got to be one of the worst movies I've seen in years. It takes half of the movie to figure out how 4 plots merge together and when they do you ask yourself \\"That's it?? You're kidding Why did I waste 2 hours watching this\\" There are many scenes that add zero to the story, only force it to be R rated and drag it out beyond the 15 minutes worth of video clip that's useful. For example, in one scene the Japanesse girl attempts to seduce her dentist, later she appears [...] naked in front of a police investigator....extract both scenes out and you'd still get the plot but you'd still feel like you've wasted your money.
B000GRUMPU|2.0|I just rented this movie this weekend because so many people had been telling me that it was great.  But I felt kind of let down after watching it.  It starts of well by giving the characters a brief introduction, but we really don't get to know any of them that well, except maybe Kurt Russell, so who really cares who dies?  There's no real build up to the huge wave hitting the ship; everything is fine, then the captain tells everyone to be quiet and listen, Richard Dreyfuss looks outside, and the wave hits; it's not all that intense. <br />Then the rest of the movie is the main characters trying to find a way to get outside the ship.  But it gets kind of repetetive and boring, because they just go from one room to another.  It's like they get into one room, someone says \\"Here, this is the only way out.\\"  Someone else says that maybe there's another way, but the other person says there isn't, then the water's coming, so they have to get out of that room quickly.  When they make their way into the next room, it's the same thing over and over again. <br />When they finally get off of the ship, they get into a raft and the entire ship goes down right after they get off.  Then a guy shoots a flare, helicopters come, and the movie's over. <br />So basically, this movie gets boring and repetetive and you just keep asking yourself when it will be over.  This is one movie I know I won't be buying.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This wonderfully informative documentary presents both scientific evidence, as well as visual facts (the \\"duh!\\" factor) to prove the notion of global warming and its effects on the planet.  It should be required viewing for everyone.  The movie was also surprisingly interesting and holds your attention, something difficult to do for a documentary.
B000ELJBAK|4.0|2006's \\"on an island\\" was a immediate classic in my world, so i had to go back and reinvestigate mr gilmour's back catalouge of solo work, which is only two other albums, sadly. this, his first solo outting, from 1978, is a fine album that i had overlooked all these years. closer in tone to \\"dark side of the moon,\\" than to \\"the wall,\\" which his 1984 release \\"about face,\\" more resembles, this recording is a strong effort, with mr gilmour's relaxed voice and lyrical guitar work shining on nine excellent songs. for me, the real standout on this record is the gorgeous instrumental \\"raise my rent,\\" which contains heartfelt guitar wizardry that is as fine as any playing to be found by mr gilmour anywhere. all in all, an outstanding rock album. i'm glad i finally got around to it.
1582701709|5.0|I have read some good books that explain what this book does but this is, by far, the best one I have read on this subject. I highly recommend it!!! Very well written, very easy to understand and well worth your time. It is a fast read. I am reading it again for the second time and will probably read it a third time! Worth every penny spent! Thank you to the authors.

B000M5AJQS|1.0|I think my title about sums it up.  Do not watch this movie thinking that, despite all the unhappy plot twists in the middle, you'll finish this movie with a smile on your face.  You won't.
B000002ACR|4.0|one of my three favorite byrds albums (the other two being \\"mr tambourine man\\" and \\"the notorious byrd brothers\\"), this is like a crossroads for all the byrds leanings in sound. the 12-string guitar is still present, the heavy psychedelia is in full bloom, and there are touches of country shadings. all in all, though, this is their most hippy oriented outting (the notorious byrd brothers album does give it a run for its money), with all the psychedelic trappings present, including reversed tapes and all that jazz. the songs are top notch, and the whole recording has a fresh playful quality that time has not diminished. this album is a must for all fans of 60's music, and highly recommended to all lovers of pop/folk/rock in general. the remasterd version is highly preferrable in sound to the first cd version, so buyer beware. the six bonus cuts could well have been left off. they add nothing to impact of the original 11 cuts.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|The David Lee Roth era of Van Halen was definitely the \\"classic\\" era and the best, and this first album I think really sums up what the band was all about.  It strikes a balance between party metal, heavy metal, Edward's guitar skill, and a little bit of lighter fare.  Something I hadn't realized before becoming a fan of the band was that they were also capable of vocal harmony and I think the instrumentalists sound very good backing up Roth.  Well, on with the list: <br /> <br />Runnin' With the Devil--This to me is the theme song of the album.  It's got a great march tempo with that incredibly heavy distorted trademark guitar sound, introduced by Michael Anthony's pounding bass at the beginning.  I think David Lee Roth's voice sounds best on this song, with a good balance between the jazzy vibrato and his famous overtone screams and yelps.  It's a catchy, listener-friendly song but such a great example of Edward's adaptability to poppier songs, in terms of showcasing his playing but containing it within a song that would get played on the radio. <br /> <br />Eruption--An instrumental that is the opposite of what I said above.  This is a minute and forty-two seconds of Edward Van Halen unleashed on the guitar with maximum distortion, whammy bar, echo effects, and crazy Baroque-like shredding.  I'm so glad that this track is included on this album. <br /> <br />You Really Got Me--I often skip this track when listening as I don't think they did much for it by covering it.  It's really just the old Kinks song with Roth's yelps and Edward's distortion kind of dressing it up. <br /> <br />Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love--My favorite song.  The opening guitar riff is, I don't know, sexy, and the heavy minor key makes it a classic, ominous heavy metal song.  The overdubbed electric sitar adds interest to the refrains and we get to hear some plain clean guitar during the quieter bridge. <br /> <br />I'm the One--Classic speed metal, pretty straightforward without anything reallyoutstanding about it, just more good vocal harmonies and terrific wild guitar playing.  I do like the bridge in which they all scat in a capella harmony for a few measures, though. <br /> <br />Jamie's Cryin'--A good poppy, catchy number with a moderate tempo, wailing guitar riff, and a good storyline in the lyrics.  I seem to really notice Michael Anthony's high vocal harmony and Alex Van Halen's drumming on this track.  The fade-out ending make this one even more radio-friendly. <br /> <br />Atomic Punk--What I like most about this one is the way it makes fun of the punk movement that was trying to stir up trouble at the same time that Van Halen was spawning hair metal.  The song has a punk beat but otherwise is all VH in its sound, right down to the tuneless distortion in the introductory guitar riff. <br /> <br />Feel Your Love Tonight--This one reminds me of \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\".  I don't have much to say about it for that reason but it's a good party-metal song. <br /> <br />Little Dreamer--The only song on the album that I blatantly don't like, it just sounds like filler or an afterthought and I usually skip it. <br /> <br />Ice Cream Man--From what I understand, this is another cover song, though I haven't heard the original.  Definitely brands Diamond Dave as a hedonistic ladies' man while we get to hear Edward play an acoustic guitar during the opening blues jam. <br /> <br />On Fire--The band may have made fun of the punk movement in \\"Atomic Punk\\" but here, punk's influence is obvious.  This song is really too frenetic and screamy for my liking, but the title is appropriate and it's not a bad song. <br />
0609610570|5.0|The key point in the whole book is the first word of the title - EXECUTION. There is without question in business in this country, and to a far greater extent overseas, a failure to execute. Businesses, like people have wonderful thoughts, ideas, notions, desires, goals, objectives, and needs. Try finding the company, entity, institution that bottom line, successfully gets things done. It comes back to EXECUTION.<br /><br />The authors are as professional as you can get. Larry Bossidy is a product of the General Electric system of management. He is the man credited with building the division now known as GE Capital into what it is today. GE Capital is one of the most profitable divisions of any corporation in the world, and the envy of every financial institution including Wall Street.<br /><br />Bossidy was one of three men in the running to become Chairman of General Electric. He lost to Jack Welch. It is traditional that when you are passed over as Chairman of GE, you take your time, but you leave. Bossidy left to run Allied Signal, which then was absorbed into Honeywell. It was during that corporate transformation that Bossidy became associated with the techniques that you are reading in his book, \\"Execution-The Discipline of Getting Things Done\\".<br /><br />His co-author is Ram Charan, who has taught at both Harvard Business, and the Kellogg School of Northwestern University. Charan has functioned as an international business consultant specializing in management. Without being mentioned, it is obvious that at some point Charan consulted for Bossidy somewhere along the way, and this is how the partnership was formed.<br /><br />Why You Must Read this Book?<br /><br />You read every word in a book like \\"Execution\\", because you are getting it from the horse's mouth. Even if other people can say it better, Bossidy is the guy who made the big bucks doing it. Who wouldn't want to read a book on playing golf under pressure by Tiger Woods, or how you should prepare for a big basketball game the day of the game by Michael Jordan.<br /><br />Bossidy is the real deal. He has run a major corporation, and posted major results, for a long period of time. All the major players are in agreement; that this is the man you go to when you want to talk about management. Now having said that, does the book ramble, yes, could it be shorter, yes, could it better written, the answer is of course. It still doesn't make any difference. You have to read Bossidy, because even Jack Welch at GE read this book.<br /><br />Here's what you will learn very quickly<br /><br />1) Execution isn't everything - it's the ONLY THING<br /><br />You'll remember that Vince Lombardi, the Green Bay Packer's coach use to say that winning isn't everything; it's the only thing. The same thing can be said about EXECUTION. The only purpose bottom line for a business to be in business is to execute the goals, and objectives of the corporation.<br /><br />2) The difference between Dreams, and Results is how you EXECUTED<br /><br />Businesses started with goals and objectives, and then you have to get to reality. Everything in between is how you execute, and the authors make clear at every opportunity those instances where corporations did well (General Electric, Dell, EDS), and those times when corporations failed (Xerox, Lucent, Kodak, Motorola, AT&T). The examples given are thorough, and make sense. You know all these corporations.<br /><br />3) The importance of the talent you field<br /><br />Bossidy is so right on this one. He says that he spent 40% of his time picking the players. In the end, how much can a CEO personally do, or deliver? It's true that a CEO can fairly easily blow up a corporate structure in a year or two. The two authors say the same CEO picking the right talent can deliver enviable results. They must be held to high accountable standards. You use the feedback to power the results.<br /><br />4) Constant involvement with that talent<br /><br />Bossidy is not a guy that leaves things to human resources. Bossidy talks about the importance of the lunch or dinner with his management team members, how he was constantly sizing them up. Could they deliver, would they execute. He is the only CEO I have ever heard of who personally would check referrals on those he hired. That kernel of information tells you everything. One could almost argue that if you put the right players into place, your job is 90% done, providing the system works.<br /><br />I would like to take a moment to tell you how you work with a book like this. You need to write in the margins, you must underline, and you must question, and annotate the entire book. If you are someone that finds himself commuting either to work, or spending significant time in a car, than the audio version is excellent as well because it is in the author's voices.<br /><br />Recognize that this is a book you will read, or listen to many times. There are multiple layers of messages here, and you will not capture them all with the first run through of either the book, or the audio. Bossidy is acknowledged to be one of the most successful businessmen of his era, take advantage of it, and pull everything you can out of his book.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />Richard StoyeckYou use the feedback to power the results.  <br /> <br /> <br />4) Constant involvement with that talent <br /> <br />Bossidy is not a guy that leaves things to human resources.

B0002O06N0|4.0|Recordings on this album doesn't sound as well as Chulahoma, but the set is very good overall.
B000GFLEWW|4.0|unlike mr gilmour's other two solo efforts, which more favor the tone of \\"dark side of the moon,\\" this 1984 release has more of a \\"the wall\\" vibe to it, with heavy synthesizers, keyboard work, and organ coloring the whole affair. which ever you prefer, all three of his albums are a must for fans of pink floyd. the highlight on this record, i feel, is the great instrumental \\"let's get metaphysical,\\" which has an anthem like feel to it. \\"murder,\\" is another standout track, which starts out as a ballad, then breaks out into guitar fireworks at the end. \\"blue light,\\" with pronounced synthesizers and horns is also a powerful track. the whole thing is wonderfully done, actually. you can't go wrong with this if you are a fan of floyd, or classic rock in general.
0743289412|1.0|I have read most of Stephen King's novels and have enjoyed them, but this one has been a disappointment.  I read the first 100 pages or so and just can't pick it up again.  It is garbage!
B000N6U0E2|2.0|This movie was soooo slow.. At great story, ruined by a move that was 30minutes too long.
B000A7S4B0|4.0|very different from their other albums....  Nice though.  Listen 1st then decide.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|After one listen, I said to myself, \\"Wow this really lacks everything I loved about Funeral.  I'll have to go on Amazon and write a review chiding this band for making an overproduced mess with murky vocals, poor songwriting, and way too much organ.\\"  (I know, there will be people on here who think \\"he should have stuck with his first instinct!!!\\").  But ANYWAY, I put the CD down for a few days and then thought I would give it another chance.  OK, a little better, some of the songs starting to grow on me a bit, and hmmm....they really tried some interesting new things on here.  I started reading some other reviews and realizing that I might be missing something, I listened to it a few more times.  Wow, this is clearly not a remake of Funeral but it is something altogether different and unique and dark (let me stress dark---this is what you would call a pretty \\"heavy\\" album).  I personally love it, and if you find some of the songs a bit slow and heavy, there is always the (very big) payoff of \\"No Cars Go\\" to look forward to (one of the finest Arcade Fire songs I have heard, by far).  This is not an album to listen to once and make a judgment on it.  Another reviewer/commenter on here has suggested that this is a copout---that I am trying to make myself accept this to be a good album by imploring others to listen to it more than once.  I strongly disagree with this person (obviously)---some of my favorite CD's did not \\"blow me away\\" the very first time I heard them.  In fact a truly complex and beautiful song will take its time to creep into your subconscious, but once it is there, it will never leave.  Simple pop songs can \\"grab\\" you the first time---but complex art often takes a little time.  Give this CD a chance if you enjoyed Funeral---it really is a worthy follow-up by a band which is not afraid to take a risk.
B00005JPLU|4.0|There are times when a film starring virtually unknown actors electrifies the screen and the audience. This is one of those times. From beginning to end, I was riveted to my seat. I predict that a few years from now, when some people say, \\"They don't make 'em like that anymore,\\" they'll be referring to \\"300\\" and movies like it. <br /> <br />Now, a \\"critical\\" comment on certain \\"critics.\\" There are a lot of naysayers who complain about historical inaccuracies in the film. My question to them is \\"Why?\\" This movie is about a real historical event and many of the roles were of real people who participated. But everyone going into this movie KNEW (or should have known) that it was based on a \\"graphic novel.\\" Some such novels are referred to as \\"faction\\" - a mixture of fact and fiction. So I went into the theater expecting nothing more than a good tale of action and adventure. And, I got what I was looking for. Critics looking for a factual retelling of events should rent or buy the History Channel special, \\"Last Stand of the 300.\\" But if you do, buy some \\"No-Doz\\" tablets to stay awake ... something no one needed to take for this film. <br /> <br />Final note. If you're wondering why I only rated it 4 out of 5, here's why. I was totally immersed in the action when a film-goer 2 seats behind me started laughing and said, \\"Oh, God - a smallpox vaccination.\\" My eyes were immediately drawn to the bare upper left arm of a Spartan soldier who was talking to Leonidas and, sure enough, there was a big-as-life circular smallpox vaccination scar on his arm. It did take some enjoyment away from the film as I confess to spending some of my time looking for other flubs (Rolex watches, etc.). Didn't see any. And, if it hadn't been for a sharp-eyed film-goer, I'd have rated this film a solid 5. <br /> <br />It is already on my \\"to buy\\" list when the DVD is made available.

0385338686|5.0|I have read all of these books except '& baby' and although I cannot identify with Becky's clothing and shoe addictions, there are still elements that I can identify with.  The characters are well developed, sometimes I feel like I could pass her best friend on the streets of London.  If they ever made this book into a movie, you would probably have to have the the What Not To Wear gal playing Becky with Cameron Diaz as the best friend.  I have recommended this book to several people and have found a few just as determined as I was to get through the entire series.  Get them in order, you can pick up bits and pieces that you  miss but I think trying to catch up takes away a little bit from the entire Bloomwood experience.  If you miss a year or two in her life, it's a lot! Write on Sophie!
B000068FXR|5.0|Several other reviews go into great and insightful detail, so I won't be redundant.  Suffice it to say that as a young man I wore out a cassette of this album with my Panasonic \\"portable\\" player and its single bud headphone!  I knew nothing about music then, but was mesmerized by the cleverness and imagination in these songs.  Now, as an older music junkie, I'd really forgotten about this until a chance hearing of \\"Poor Boy\\" in an old record store.  What a joy to hear it all again in this re-mastering! Sure, the nostalgia was a big part of it, but now I can really see the genius in the composition, usually using just a couple of instruments (varied from song to song) to create the heart of the tune.  Yes, use headphones (I recommend the TWO bud variety) to get the full richness and clever additions to each song.  I like almost all of Supertramp's albums, but for me this is the one that moves more out of the pop/prog zone and into an area that's really unique.  It's one of the few in my collection that I can't play too much.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I saw this film in the theatre and have been anticipating its release to DVD. Just hearing the theme song gets me choked up. I have always been a fan of Rocky movies and this one is no exception. This film is just as good as the first Rocky installment. Sylvester Stallone has brought back the champ in a big way.
B000LB4DWO|1.0|I expected a lot more from this movie.  There was nothing original about this one, if you have seen the other Superman movies (which were great) you will be bored with this one.

B000KGGB2A|5.0|This come-back release for Take That is absolutely superb.  You would never have guessed that they were ever gone from the music scene for the past few years.  The tunes are right on with today's hits yet it retains the sound that made the group a hit in the past.  You would never have guessed that Robbie Williams is no longer a part of the ensemble. Take That is positively right on.
B000JFDBXO|2.0|We downloaded this to try out the new \\"Amazon Unbox\\" service for TiVo owners.  The 105-minute movie took about 5 hours to download over DSL.  The video quality was pretty awful -- any horizontal panning flickered badly, and there was a lot of that here.  Relatively still scenes were fine. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have explained the movie's faults pretty well.  It had the fanciest special effects of any in the series, but little of the charm.  Easily my least favorite of the X-Men movies.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|One of the few times the sequel is better than the original (see my review for the significantly weaker Road Trip), this is just a fun movie that still makes me laugh out loud. The actors are great, from Buffy's Michelle Trachtenberg as the \\"guy who just happens to dress like a girl\\" to MAtt Damon as a thrash metal rock singer and Lucy Lawless as a dominatrix.  The theme song \\"Scotty Doesn't Know\\" is so ridiculously catchy that you don't even mind that they play 3 or 4 different versions of it throughout the film.  Yes, they do focus on only the most famous cities in Europe (although they do throw in Bratislava as a twist) and play on a lot of familiar stereotypes, they still manage to throw in some pretty funny observations that, having lived in Europe for 3 years, I can attest to their validity.  This unrated version is a real kick too, from the deleted scenes (some of them were hinted at in the closing credits, others are just as funny as the scenes they kept) to the \\"bootleg\\" version (\\"we bootlegged the bootlegger!), and the Green Fairy floating around the DVD menus, it's worth the cost of admission.

B000056NX5|5.0|I've seen this musical many, many times but this is THE BEST version! The men's voices are SUPERB! The directing and staging is excellent; Judas and Jesus play off of each other to create a real tension in the plot line that I have never seen in any other production. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD.

0385338082|5.0|This book drew me in and I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  Completely believable that we could let our deepest and darkest secrets out in a time of desperation.  How it all rushed out and then rushed back is the journey you take with this one.  I would definitely read this again.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Before this Bond my favorites were- On Her Majesty's Secret Service & Goldfinger. Goldfinger for the innuendo/takeover in gold- by the monoply private bank/the Federal Reserve. Majesty- simply for the love story of a \\"Shane\\"(western movie) kind of guy believing he could have a life.  The reason this gets my best bond is it takes on both scenerios: deadly enemy/love. And Bond is caught between both.  A 9/11 deadly scenerio wher stock market puts were placed by those in the KNOW(actually fact) on certain airlines, before an \\"event\\", causing a dramatic drop in that stock. Simply put its mega bucks on a gamble that \\"hedged bet terrorism\\" is a winner.  Then add a love affair that is right for Bond but?  The SIGNATURE BOND FILMATICS are high calibre as always: opening artistic sequence(my wife enjoyed), 2/HIGH! action sequences follow.  The on the flt dialogue/action is pure Bond. Excellent!  Remember this ain't Shakespeare. But when it come to action/it is.  The toys are right up to date/ high tech.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 00!!!!!!!
B000LC3IDI|3.0|The first \\"Saw\\" was cool, and clever, but this one takes the cake. It doesn't matter that I haven't seen Saw II yet, they all stand on their own pretty well. Though I do plan on seeing the second one.    Saw III featured some Great torture rigs and contraptions. Appalling is an understatement. I'm a horror fanatic from way back and some of the scenes in this movie made me shutter and wince. Okay, I was actually squeemish during a few parts, must be losing my edge. It is definitely not for the faint-hearted.    The plot is strong too. We get the rundown on what's really been going on behind the scenes through the other Saw movies, but it's not necessary to see those films to appreciate this one. Strong story, good directing and excellent set design, camera work.    There is a lot of jumping around between past and present so be alert, it can get confusing. I actually found that back and forth to be a little annoying. Also there were a few parts that seem insignificant, but I guess they serve to give us insight into the characters. One example is the girl who play's Jigsaw's psycho-let's test your will to live-in-training, and the part where she sits down and begins carving a line into her leg. We see other lines there so we can establish fairly quickly that she has issues, though I think we're be able to get that early on in the film anyway.    The acting was good in most cases, but Jigsaw's protege delivered some pretty weak lines.    I recommend this to any horror fan with a strong stomach. But it is not for the squeemish or easily offended. This is a seriously gruesome, and violent film.
B00005ATQD|5.0|When \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" was released in the U.S., in order to escape an X-rating, certain digital images were inserted during the infamous orgy scene. However, the version of Kubrick's film released in Europe did not include these digital images. When the film became available on DVD, one version (with the digitalized images) was distributed here in America, while the \\"European\\" version of the DVD shown the scene minus the inserted digital images. You can order the European version of the DVD not only here but any number of DVD distribution companies. The problem is, the European version will not play on DVD players sold in the electronic and stereo equipment stores in the U.S.   Why not? Because DVD players sold in the United States are designated Region 1 players, while the European version of the DVD is a Region 2 DVD, and the Region of the DVD player must be the same Region as the DVD or you get no picture.  How do you know the Region of a DVD? On the back of its case, usually in very small print, is an oval or rectangular print of the world with a number right in its middle. This image with a number is very often not easy to find on the back of the case, so you must look with varying degrees of difficulty to discover it. It's definitely always there, believe me, you just must really look for it sometimes. Once you find the oval globe, you can't miss the number in its middle, and that's the DVD's region. So, knowing that all store-bought DVD players in this country are Region 1 players, the Region 2, European version of the film is incompatible with it, and voila, no picture.  Other American films share this same problem. David Lynch's \\"Lost Highways\\" is unavailable in its widescreen version, with a quality image transfer from film to DVD only in the Region 2, European version. The Region 1 version available here is not widescreen, distributed from Canada, and is of poor quality. Sam Peckingpah's only war movie, \\"Cross of Iron\\" suffers from this exact same dilemma. Orson Welles's classic, \\"The Magnificent Ambersons,\\" is available only from Germany, in a Region 2 format. We're talking about great American films, folks, for some reason or another, unavailable for viewing here because of this Region incompatibility between the player and DVD itself.  Why is this? The powers that be (whoever that is) have divided cinema on DVD into twelve Regions, in order to control the competion between themselves.  Oh, there are some popular foreign films available for play here in Region 1 versions for our Region 1 players, but those films are comparatively few and far between. So, is there no option for the film buff, such as myself, who enjoys both domestic and foreign films which are not coded Region 1 DVDs?  Thanfully, we do have an alternative and it's called the Region-free or Multi-region DVD player. You will not find those players at your local chain electronics store, however. They only sell Region 1 DVD players. You must go online, and THERE you will find these DVD players which will display movies from any Region, from any country in the world. American DVD players also only play movies with what's called NTSC television screen encoding, which also limits the films available for view because many foreign DVDs require PAL television encoding. The Region-free player also eliminates this distinction as long as your television is not a dinosaur. Cinema is an art form which should be made available for anybody, anywhere to enjoy. It's not, unless you get a Region-free DVD player.  I realize most people don't care to go beyond what's commercially available in film, and they should just stick to what they have, and when it's replacement time, return to their local electronics outfit. For those demanding world cinema's availability, Region-free players are the only way to go. I've made that choice and, now, my reach extends to movies from all over the planet. I can even see the magnificent \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" minus those damned digital images.  Instead of going in this sensible direction, the owners to DVD rights in our country are pointing us in a different direction, to high definition DVD. That's right; you can now upgrade the picture quality of Region 1 DVDs by purchasing a new high definition DVD player in conjunction with new high definition DVDs. Forget about your existing 5.1 surround sound player and supporting discs; start all over again with high definition. There are two competing companies offering the next level in DVD technology: Blu-ray and HD. Both companies are owned by various major movie studios with certain studios backing one while other studios support the other. It's (high definition) being touted as the next step in DVD technology, and maybe it is, if someone's just now starting a DVD collection or is willing to chunk away the old, outdated stuff in favor of high definition players and DVDs. But buyers beware: the choice of high definition DVDs offered by both Blu-ray and HD at your local store is very limited, and a substantial difference in picture quality only comes with the high end new players, costing anywhere from $600.00 to over $1,000.00. Your last consideration is which brand to choice, Blu-ray or HD? One system's DVDs are not compatible with the other's player and visa versa. It's much wiser to wait and see which company wins before strongly committing one way or the other.

B000H5TVJY|5.0|This movie has a wonderful soundtrack. Christian Bale is magnificent! His character is one that is inside everyone, and the ending has a great twist that I have found to leave some confused. I watched it twice before really understanding the ending. This is a movie you can watch over and over because of Christian Bale's character, Patrick, having such a weird sence of being, and very misunderstood sence of humor! I can not recommend this movie enough! The color is very brillant as well.
B000002U9W|4.0|Ever since I was 6 or so (35 yrs ago) I have been just mesmerised, musically in love.....with Pink Floyd. I find \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" definitive of the modern Floyd sound as much as any in the early era. I like the well composed yet seemingly randomised sequences on the long side( long tune on CD) and the diversity of musical forms shown within.  I see it as a harbinger of the future for them as it has some very good songs thatsadly, not many know.  I got it in 1976 on album and later , as all things, digital in the eighties.  i have learned on piano and guitar most of it, as is fun to play , not hard , yet entertaining.<br /><br />Itis a must for the budding PF fan. Waters inluences give us a hint of textures he can only provide and Gilmore seems to be at ease with his new surroundings .....Buy it , you wont regret it, man.
1582701709|5.0|I watched the DVD several times and there are points of interest that I like to go back to.  Sometimes it is not so easy to just throw in the DVD.  Having the book allows me to read a portion over and over, so I may reflect on the topic for myself.  Find \\"key\\" phrases that I write down and post in areas of my house to remind me of what I am aspiring to do.  This has in turn given me and my husband the opportunity to write out ways to live the secret in our lives.  I think if you really want to be committed to living the life of The Secret, the book is an additional tool to support you in you aspirations.
B000M341QE|4.0|I suppose it was all the hype, the critical praise, and the cast that made \\"The Departed\\" one of my must-see films.  Having missed it during its original theatrical run, I made sure that it was at the top of the list of my purchases, considering how much I had admired Scorcese's \\"Gangs of New York\\" and \\"The Aviator.\\"<br /><br />Sadly, the BEST PICTURE winner does not meet my expectations.  The story is rather predictable and there is really a minimum of thrills in what should have been a film filled with them.  While there is an attempt to make the characters less stereotypical of the genre, they ultimately fall into the familiar, with Leo's undercover cop the only sympathetic one in the lot.<br /><br />Dicaprio and Damon take top acting honors while Nicholson is basically playing Nicholson, something that he's been doing for the past thirty years.  Sheen and Baldwin appear in what could best be categorized as \\"glorified\\" cameos.<br /><br />And how Wahlberg received an Oscar nod is a mystery, due to his limited and not-so-impressive on-screen time.<br /><br />If the Boston PD really talks like that within the confines of their respective precincts, then they are in need of some serious \\"profanity management.\\"<br /><br />I'm giving the film FOUR STARS solely on the strength of the director.<br /><br />It's just s THREE-STAR movie, though!
0374105235|4.0|This books illustrates vividly how easy it is to become a killer. There seems to be a fine line between good and evil in war-torn countries such as Sierra Leone and that line is crossed back and forth often. <br /> It(the book), also, shows that rehabilitive measures do work and that with young people all efforts to do so should be made. <br /> It is fortunate that author, Ismael Beah, was redeemed in that fashion because he clearly has much to offer the world in any field he chooses. <br />I hope he chooses writing!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I agree that the Timothy Dalton version is great, and is also more faithful to the book, but this one is by far the most sensual version ever. I've also seen them all. As noted by many others, the chemistry between Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson is obvious, and they are both superb actors. The worst version, in my opinion, is the Zeffirelli film of a few years back with William Hurt as a stiff, unloveable Rochester. Who thought THAT casting was a good idea? And though I'm fond of the Orson Welles/Joan Fontaine version, Orson's just a tad hammy at times, don't you think? There's plenty of room for multiple versions of this classic. For me, this wonderful version compares to the earlier Dalton version somewhat like the recent \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen compares to the longer and more faithful Colin Firth version. I love them both, for different reasons.
0393327655|5.0|Brilliant book from Sam Harris, one of atheism's new muscle-boys. Clearly and convincingly argued and understandable by anyone. For something a lot more challenging try Scott Atran's In Gods We trust.
B00027JZ3E|5.0|I have been a fan of this film since I was seven-years-old and I watched it with my sister one night on television.  Its just one of those seminal 80s movies that everyone should see once in their life (weither they love it or not), just like `The Goonies' and `Sixteen Candles.'  And despite the cheese factor, I still love the movie even today.  There is just something about it that makes engrossing me and has me watching it every time I come across the movie. <br /> <br />And, funny enough a couple years ago when I was sorting through my college acceptance letters, doing research on the several schools that accepted me, I realized that one of the school was UC Santa Cruz (the movie was filmed in Santa Cruz and the town in the film is based on the town of Santa Cruz), and it was because of this that I visited, and then fell in love with the town, and thus decided to attend the school.  I didn't come here because the movie was filmed here, but the movie did help me make a decision to go visit the school.  And let me tell you it's a little creepy walking around that boardwalk amusement park at night. <br /> <br />But anyway, if you looking for a semi-spooky, camping/cheesy/adventurous/entertaining movie, `the lost boys' is a very good choice.  It stars Diane Wiest (`Parenthood'), Jason Patrick , Corey Haim, Corey Feldman (`The Goonies'), Jamie Gertz (`Less than Zero'), and Edward Herman (TV's `Gilmore Girls'). The `special DVD' version contains a Commentary by the director (which is interesting, but most of what he says describes the plot and framing of the shots) and several retrospective featurettes which are pretty much strictly for fans of the movie. <br />
0060526491|5.0|Melancholy is the right word for the mood of this little book! The drawings and the rhymes are so simple, yet they evoke such emotion - I was horrified in a gleeful sort of way - 'uh oh, I can't believe where this is heading' - it's so grim and sad, yet I found myself laughing out loud. Definitely for those with a certain sense of humour.
B000E8NQUE|5.0|I have listened to this album in every format (vinyl, cassette, 8-track, 80's CD/1997 Remaster/SACD) and I have to say that I am impressed with this latest mix.  It sounds beefier, crisper and some songs seem just a hair longer in the refrains & sequed sections.  The vocals really sound smooth, especially on \\"Dear Diary\\" where you can practically hear the air from the leslie cabinets.  The extra tracks are nice and I always wanted to hear \\"The Voyage\\" all by itself & after 30 years of playing this album, I finally can.  I thank the boys at Threshold for this special gift (how did they know what I was thinking?). <br /> <br />The cover art is a little softer & faded, but who cares?!  I still have the LP, cassette, previously released CD versions and a bloody concert t-shirt of this album cover from a 1993 concert in Buffalo (Melody Fair).  I've more than studied the friggin' artwork of this album.  Anyhoo, I think this latest release was a grand success and highly recommend it.  I can't speak for SACD release of \\"Question Of Balance\\", but judging from the reviews, I'll probably just stick with the 1997 remaster.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|how can it be. This film stands on it's own without comparisons. Very happy to see that DeCaprio has finally lost that intolerable goofiness of his. Great acting by everyone and great suspense - the tension is on without letup throughout the film. <br />Could have done without Nicholson's little scene in the porn theater.  The 2nd disc is as good as the movie itself - glad I bought the 2 disc set.
B000002GYG|5.0|This is unlike any other Tom Waits album. It was recorded live with a Jazz Quartet backing him, now I can hear you thinking immediately this is going to be dreadful - its not.<br /><br />In fact its astonishing, there are no long solos, the backing quartet just provide a swinging backdrop for Waits to weave his unusual brand of story telling.<br /><br />Sometimes very funny, occasionally sad and always lyrically interesting, Waits scats/talks and sings in his distinctive growl.<br /><br />You might want to hear this first, before purchasing, as I concede it's not going to be everybody's cup of tea.<br /><br />However it has remained my favourite Tom Waits album for decades now, despite Swordfishtrombones etc.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|that doesn't resolve itself. Multiple stories going on at the same time - I don't mind guessing games, but I like films where the guessing ends when the film does. Perhaps this is 'intellectually challenging' for some in college art class,,but this old technique just seems to go on forever. I liked the acting - I liked the visuals.  Felt like going down a ladder where the bottom 5 rungs are missing. Academy Award?? Are you kidding??
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The extra footage explains things that were murky in the theater. We now know how Orlando Bloom's character was so skilled in swordfighting and in military engineering.

Richard has a lot of courage and it appears that he has a lot of luck as well, but I think it's his courage that made all the difference.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I hate to admit it but I was one of the many people who were against Daniel Craig playing James Bond in Casino Royale.  I was still upset with how Pierce Brosnan had been treated by the producers of the \\"Bond\\" series, plus I felt if anyone could take Brosnan's place, it was Clive Owen.  I'd seen Daniel Craig in The Road to Perdition, Laura Croft: Tomb Raider and Munich, but I just couldn't picture him as 007.  I'm happy to report, however, that he completely won me over with his realistic portrayal of James Bond in Casino Royale.  Though I won't say that Craig is better than Sean Connery (after all I grew up with Sean Connery playing Bond back in the early sixties), I will say that he runs a close second place with Pierce Brosnan.  Certainly Craig has the best physical body of anyone to play this character, and the fight and action scenes are hard, fast, and utterly breathtaking.  I expect and look forward to seeing Craig in the next two-or-three \\"Bond\\" movies.<br /><br />As everyone knows by now, Bond gets his \\"00\\" status at the beginning of Casino Royale after making two kills.  He's then assigned to capture a terrorist bomber in the hopes of learning who the man's boss is.  This leads to one of the most exciting action sequences in \\"Bond\\" history, not to mention the public's first look at the art of \\"free running,\\" which is astounding to behold.  Later, when back in England, a disgruntled \\"M\\" puts her new \\"00\\" agent on a leave of absence, warning him that he basically needs to get his act together, or else.  Bond takes it upon himself to track down the boss of the terrorist bomber, and this eventually leads him to Le Chiffre, the financier for the world's leading terrorist organization that's led by a man known only as Mr. White.  Bond and Le Chiffre will go head to head in a battle of skill and wits during a high stakes Texas Hold'em game.  We're talking about a game where the winner will take home over a hundred million dollars.  During all of this, Bond will have to battle a couple of angry Africans with a rather big machete, survive a poisoning attempt, and more importantly grow to love the woman who's been assigned to work with him, Vesper Lynd.  Before the end of the movie is reached, however, Bond will learn what real pain is while being tortured and then again through a terrible act of betrayal.  As \\"M\\" later tells him, learn to trust no one.<br /><br />Casino Royale was definitely one of the best movies of 2006, and Daniel Craig pretty much won the hearts of most of the \\"Bond\\" fans, including myself.  Though there were a few things about the film that I didn't understand (why was Judi Dench chosen to play \\"M\\" at the beginning of Bond's career when she didn't actually come into the picture till his later years and why have him win the Aston Martin DB-5 in a poker game, when the car was actually provided for him by MI-6's Q Branch back in Goldfinger?), it doesn't take away from the sheer fun of watching the movie.  Eva Green is just as lovely as Vesper Lynd as she was in The Kingdom of Heaven, and Giancarlo Giannini was the ideal choice to play Mathis.  I've never heard of Mads Mikkelsen, but he was also perfect as the villain, Le Chiffre.  All in all, Casino Royale is a fantastic addition to the \\"Bond\\" franchise.  It's certainly a film that you'll want to watch over and over again.  The two-disc DVD edition includes three featurettes: Becoming Bond, which runs around twenty-five minutes in length and has an interview with Craig about the challenges he faced in taking on the role, James Bond: For Real, which is also about twenty-five minutes long and goes into the making of the movie and how some of the stunts were done, and Bond Girls Are Forever, which was about fifty minutes in length and deals with many of the lovely ladies who have appeared in the \\"Bond\\" movies since Dr. No.  This was quite enjoyable to watch and had interviews with Ursula Andreas, Honor Blackman, Jill St. John, and a score of others.  Last on the DVD is a music video of Chris Cornell singing the theme song to Casino Royale.  I wasn't overly impressed with the song, though the rest of the music works well with the film.  If you're a \\"Bond\\" fan, then Casino Royale is a must for your movie library.  I've already watched the DVD twice since getting it in the mail a few days ago.  Needless to say, this movie is Highly Recommended.music video of Chris Cornell singing the theme song to Casino Royale.

B000MKIR80|1.0|I rented this movie because I registered my TIVO with Amazon and got the $15 credit.  I thought it might be a good opportunity to see some movies I wouldn't normally rent.  I watched the trailer on this, thought it looked like it might be amusing, and downloaded it.  Unfortunately, the only funny scene in the movie was in the trailer and I ended up falling asleep the first 30 minutes into it.  After I woke up, I thought maybe I hadn't given it a fair shot and went back to try it again.  I was right to fall asleep the first time through.  I don't usually rate movies - or anything for that matter, but felt compelled to share my opinion with anyone who was seriously considering spending money on this one.  Spend that $3.99 on a burger, or a good book...anything else but this.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|Okay I am huge lover of romantic comedies and I have a huge list of favorites and I can say that this one doesn't even make it on my waiting list. The movie starts out with pretty good promise  but then slowly falls to apart. The movies which is supposed to be about two women (Diaz and Winslet) switching houses and lives and trying to find love. However they don't show equal amount of attention to the character Iris (Winslet) who actually had the better story line and more charcter depth to build on. They story is mostly on Amanda (Diaz)and Iris's older brother (Jude Law). These two people just fall into together, there was no build to their realtionship, then we are supposed to believe that they are in \\"love\\". Then you have Iris and Myles (Jack Black)these two people meet and strike up a friendship thats slowly (very slowly because they only get few scenes together)starts to build into something more. They just focused on one side of the film and it seemed to be that the other story line of the film was left hanging and a little rushed together.

B000LC55F2|3.0|I was ready to give this movie 5-stars until the ending.  In my opinion good acting, interesting plot twists, a rational (if somewhat convoluted) plot line, some fascinating illusions, great period photography.<br /><br />Then the psuedo-science, supernatural ending.  Folks, science fiction is extrapolation of known science into realms of the possible.  Everything else is fantasy or supernatural fiction.  We certainly know enough about electricity to know the premise of the ending is totally implausible.<br /><br />This movie leads us down a path where the illusions, no matter how fantastic they seem, obey laws of physics and plausibility.  Then we're hit with a supernatural ending.  It appears the scriptwriters wrote themselves into a corner and couldn't determine a rational, plausible method to explain the final illusion of the movie.  They simply resorted to fantasy.  Too bad since I really wanted to enjoy this movie.

B000JLTRKE|4.0|Dismiss what you read about other critics comments about how Stone has sold out to commericial interests.  This is what Stone envisioned and he brings what he wanted to the screen with powerful emotion. Yes, naming a baby should be a heart felt experience between a man and his wife, yet one critic bashed Stone's scenes involving the playful arguements between the trapped police officer and his wife.  Scenes like this play out hundreds of times a day among middle-class American families.  I am glad that Stone was able to use the baby naming scenes as a way for viewers to see the interplay between a loving couple. I also thought that Stone effectually, captured the tension of the families wanting to hear news about their loved ones.  As one critic said \\"if your into the 9/11 thing\\". I have no idea what this means but fear, hopelessness, shock, rage, vengence, horror, and compassion crisscrossed the emotions of family members whose loved ones were in the towers, were on board the two exploding jets, or were involved as first responders to the catastrophy. Thousands of people were emotionally affected, but Stone focused his film on a small group of Port Authority officers who are on a mission that none of them can fully comprehend. Eventually the film centers on 2 main characters who are trapped under the rubble.  The camera work in the film is excellent, the editing is crisp, location shooting realistic, and Cage and the supporting actors all give believable performances.  I guess there were many disappointed people that assumed Stone would offer a leftist, controversial  view of the horror that occured that day. I guess we will have to what for another Michael Moore propaganda film for that.  World Trade Center is a film that would probably make former NYC mayor Rudy Gulianni proud of the way Port Authority officers performed so bravely that day.
B00005B4GU|5.0|..and LISTEN to it. Don't just play it and wander off to do other things, LISTEN to this record. Let the sounds travel through your ears, through your body, through your brain. Absorb the music. Otherwise, you will drop this like a bad habit (unless of course, your into the various styles they represent on this album, which I am!). <br /> <br />When I have a hard time getting into an album, I put some decent headphones on and immerse myself into the world that the band is trying to convey. Radiohead has always been a great band, they have just evolved into something better. Layers upon layers of music exist here, in the world of Radiohead, and you have to have patience and an appreciation for life to enjoy it. ADD generation, look somewhere else, cause this aint for you. There are no two minute head banging pop sing-a-long song tracks here that satisfy the material world here. Sure, you can sing a long to almost all of the songs here, but they are not necessarily radio friendly, nor are they easily accesible. None of Radiohead's albums are really easily accesible. The Bends, Pablo Honey and Ok Computer seem accesible because they are wrapped up in a radio friendly traditional packaging (Ok COmputer less so). But still, Radiohead has always been about mystery and deep emotions and meanings that don't shine out on the surface, but rather are buried deep below in the soil, the dirt the anguish and pain of humanity in our technology age. There is no such thing as a layman's Radiohead song, they are DEEP. I don't believe that Radiohead are the best band on the planet, I'm not that brainwashed. However, they are amazing, and Thom Yorke's lyrical style is poetic, even if our Starbucks and Old Navy generation has no idea what he is saying. <br /> <br />To me, it seems that Radiohead craft their music with the idea that whoever listens to it must have a working intuition and a working understanding of the underlying in life. That which is not spoken speaks the loudest, thatwhich is most ugly is actually one of the most beautiful. <br /> <br />Every track shines with blistering emotion and more layers than an onion. Effects and electronic influence are rampant, however they do well to create a lush atmosphere.  <br />When paired with \\"Kid A\\", the picture becomes complete, since both albums were cut from the same session.  <br />A view into the post apocalyptic end that humanity brings upon itself in its un-relenting and subtle way. I highly recommend this, and \\"Kid A\\". Just don't be fooled by all those so called Radiohead \\"fans\\", who are more or less fanatics that love the bandwagon and love to praise other humans like they are gods or something. Very wierd!  Those are the kind of fans who cannot embrace anything new from their \\"gods\\". They like the same over and over again. That is why you will find reviews that compare this album to their previous releases. That is why you will find reviews that totally trash this album because it is too avant-garde or whatever. Truth is that people are not prepared for music that stretches outside of the radio norm/MTV generation style pop music that pleases all and lulls you to sleep, depriving you of originality and creativity. <br />We live in a generation that enjoys the novelty of past hits re-hashed and glazed over to sound fresh and new. Some of us can see right through that garbage and require something with more substance, more depth. And that is what this comes down to, Radiohead bring depth, regarless of whether you think it melodic or not. Regardless of whether you understand it or not, they bring depth and soul to an otherwise dead and souless music world. It is very incomprehensible, and very mysterious, but that is the way they like it. You can either like it or not, I have a feeling they could care less. For every so called Radiohead fan that hates their music as they evolve, others who can heed the call will listen to them. After all, real recognize real.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|What I have enjoyed the most about this movie is that it shows how easily you can practice this spirital tool of seeing the energy that surrounds us all. The more one practices the more it beomes incorporated into automatic use of this divine birthright. This awareness is essential in creating our vibrational energy to attract what we desire in our lives. Of course it shows that the controlling efforts of religious leaders and politicians impose fear to this spiritual freedom. However we have become aware of our own divine guidance from within. This spiritual evolutionary process is happening all around us and YES YOU CAN DO THIS.
B000002UJQ|5.0|For those of you \\"trying\\" to listen to this music, slow down, lay off of the crank and LISTEN to the music. How many times does this have to be said?!? <br />This aint your head bangin three power chord sing a long garbage. This is inventive music which incorporates many different styles and sounds and effects to create a musical masterpiece.  <br />Many people will not understand Radiohead, or their music. Many will slam this album, as they already have. Some say Ok Computer is boring rubbish. How is it boring? Have you read the lyrics. They are interesting to say the least, they are deep. Maybe that is why you find this music boring, you don't understand the lyrics. Most of Radioheads work is deep and under the surface type of lyrics and music. Its not made for idiots. There is a reason why many classify Radiohead as intelligent Rock.  maybe it is you that is missing something? maybe not? Maybe it is that You cannot grasp that a singer may have lyrics about our humanity as a whole, rather than just a woman who left him, or the money he makes (or whatever is popular). If you have ever noticed, most of the songs that people love are about a woman in their lives who either hurt them or loved them or a combination of both. Thom's lyrics on this album touch upon something much deeper than personal, selfish wants. They focus on the needs of humanity and their coming to grips with our harsh reality, which may not be harsh for some, but harsh for others. Remember, some people are more sensitive to the destruction of human values and the Earth than others. That's how it is. <br /> <br />There is so much life and atmosphere to this music, I cannot understand some people and why they think this is boring. The musicianship is top notch (for a commercial record). <br />Maybe you find the music boring, but only the most ADD ridden, pop music infested hater would think such things. Sure, this music aint the pinnacle of avant garde, but by whose standards? Are Radiohead trying tobe PIL? Are they trying to topple Miles Davis off of his throne? I don't think so. Radiohead made an album, the end. There shouldn't be anything more, no comparisons, no this or that.  <br />I still don't quite understand how some people find this music boring. Maybe its me. I don't know. I cannot figure it out, all that I know is that I did not like this album at first either. But after many listens, I started to become in line with it. I cannot explain it, but I like it.  <br /> <br />If you cannot find the raw emotion and epic-ness of Exit music for a film, then you need to open up more, brother. <br /> <br />I enjoy the theme, of humanity merging with our technologically advanced world, losing our humanity and souls in the process, and a man's view of how this is affecting him. <br /> <br />I noticed that most of the negative reviews are from people who listen to a lot of Classic Rock. Well, that explains everything! <br />Sure Led Zepplins great, they are nigh amazing. No one is comparing Radiohead to Led Zepplin, and the critics who compare Radiohead to Pink Floyd are, well, being critics. That's what critics do, they HAVE to put everything in its right place, or else they go crazY! Trust me, its true!  <br /> <br />Don't listen to everything your told, don't believe the hype. Find out for yourself, but also keep an open mind, and try to slow down and actually listen to the music, or you will be lost on it.

B000MEYHT4|5.0|Unbelievable. Neal, Mike & Randy have done it again! How much excellent prog music can these guys produce?!? Sola Scriptura is a fantastic effort.

0060512806|4.0|This book was a fascinating read but also very mysterious, in the way that Neal Stephenson's books tend to be. I was well over half way done before I even figured out what the book was about. The text was interesting enough that I continued read in spite of my confusion. <br /> <br />To be fair, I was not really confused by the story. I was confused by the stories. There are several, interweaved that really come together only toward the end. Some take place in modern times and others take place during World War II. They are freely intermixed. <br /> <br />For what it is worth, the book is a treasure hunt. People from our day are trying to find gold looted by the Japanese. The clues to the location of the gold follow a convoluted but fun path stretching back 60 years. The narrative is full of tangents that do not add to the story but which add immensely to the flavor of the book. It is all very Baroque. <br /> <br />Speaking of baroque, a reader who has invested the time to read the author's Baroque Cycle trilogy will notice many familiar names. Without any real connection at all, the characters in this story are almost all related to the character from the previous stories and are separated only by a few centuries of time and grammatical style. <br /> <br />It is an enjoyable book that will take a while to read but is well worth it.  <br />
B000MGUZM0|3.0|When I heard a few months back about Aracde Fire's upcoming album I was very excited. And even more so after reading Spin's (or maybe it was Blender) review of the album calling it fantastic and giving it five stars.<br /><br />To be fair, there are a few good tracks. Keep the Car Running and a few others. But most of them didn't have much of an original sound as did most of the songs on funeral. And then there are songs  like Black Mirror that made me just go UGH.<br /><br />All in all it wasn't that bad of an album, but if you were expecting another 'Funeral' like I was, you won't be every pleased.

B000MNP2KI|1.0|If you're a fan of the 007 genre of movies - regardless of whether you liked Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan better - you will HATE this movie.  From the opening credits of a stylized Las Vegas pop scene that somehow morphs into a spider-man like mandlebrot of webs - I knew I was in trouble.   Where are the silhouettes of sexy bond girls, with an opening track belted out by the latest pop sensation?  As the movie progressed we didn't see a threat of a nuclear threat, or an airplane with a country-killing laser, or a space station ready to kill the population of the earth - instead we see a villian whose main crime is being a terrorist banker - that's right - the main villian is a banker.  Who wrote this piece of - well, you know already what I think.  I think that this movie is going to kill the concept of the Bond girl - and any good Bond historian could tell you that James Bond will never fall in love after Diana Rigg died - its part of his persona - to love, live life - but always knowing he would be moving on - not settling down - who wrote this thing?  I'm sure that this movie will see some box office just because its a Bond movie - but don't be fooled by the reviews or the ratings - Bond is a mysoginistic throwback to the late 60's - a gentleman, but a gentleman who isn't afraid to take advantage of whatever comforts are thrown his way, whether its a woman or a good martini - because he knows he probably won't reach retirement age.  We don't need to see Bond having doubts about his ability to do his job - whether he's right or wrong in killing people for his country.  Do yourself a favor - go rent an old Bond movie and skip this tragedy all together.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Unlike some reviews here, I won't give away any spoilers, because the maximum enjoyment of THE PRESTIGE depends on--like a magic act--not knowing how it works (at least at first). I think it's despicable that some reviewers ruin the climax with plot giveaways without clear spoiler warnings. For shame.<br /><br />Story: Two magicians (Jackman, Bale) begin as joint apprentices and, after a pivotal tragic event, end up obsessed and bitter rivals who keep upping the magic stakes in a quest to be number one. Each cannot rest until he knows the other's magic secrets as each man takes his turn being the best.<br /><br />Ultimately, the game will be about more than magic tricks and will spill over, affecting every part of each man's life. There will be no turning back for either, because the ultimate of tricks (the one they've each constructed from their rivalry and mutual loathing) must play out to the very end. And only one magician can be the best.<br /><br />The acting is terrific. Jackman is the polished, eloquent, well-dressed, well-groomed, handsome front-man whose showmanship captivates crowds. But as we see him turn darker and more obsessed, we begin to worry for him.<br /><br />Bale is the coarser, vulgarly-accented one who is unswervingly committed to the craft. He ends up creating a trick that drives Jackman over the edge to all-out, heedless obession: The Transported Man. The quest by Jackman's character to find the secret of this trick will lead him down a very dark road.<br /><br />Bale plays his complicated role with convincing shades. Jackman is superb, sometimes pitiable, sometimes repulsive. Michael Caine does well--as always--as the man in the middle. A good man who loves his career, but who is stuck between the competitive madness. His sound advice goes unheeded, and we know that tragedy must be the result...<br /><br />While both leads are immensely watchable, Caine and Johansson are terrific in supporting roles.<br /><br />And the fact that we are reminded over and over about the title--the prestige, that part of the act where the audience is befuddled and amazed and the magician gets his glorious due, the moment of wonder and the unsolved trick--tells us we should watch, watch carefully, because the movie is about to pull a heckuva rabbit out of the hat.<br /><br />And it's hard as the film proceeds to be sure who you should root for. First this one, then that one, then...no one? Obsession is fascinating to watch, and revenge makes for a strong plot driver, but it's difficult to know who is in the right and who is in the wrong, or if both are wrong. Shades of gray turn to black, sometimes.<br /><br />Unlike THE ILLUSIONIST, last year's other feature film with a magician as the man character, this one does have surprises, things up its sleeve, that you realize bit by bit. THE ILLUSIONIST was easy to solve. You realize the trick way before the ending. In THE PRESTIGE, you are given enough clues to figure out bits of the trick early on, in the middle, and even up to the BIG one, but it still keeps you wondering, \\"What? What will they do? How will I be surprised?\\"<br /><br />And that's a lot of fun. The wondering. Because even when you congratulate yourself for figuring X or Y out early, you still have a ways to go until...the last moments of THE PRESTIGE, and at least ONE secret will not be divulged until then.<br /><br />It's a fast-paced and delicious sleight-of-hand film with two dazzling male leads who keep you guessing.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED.at part of the act where the audience is befuddled and amazed and the magician gets his glorious due, the moment of wonder and the unsolved trick--tells us we should watch, watch carefully, because the movie is about to pull a heckuva rabbit out of the hat.

0374105235|5.0|I got this book after seeing this charming young man on Jon Stewart's show.  It is not just an amazing story, it is amazing how well the story is written.  It has the feel of an adventure \\"hero's journey\\" as you are propelled forward in this incredible tale.  Sad without sentimentality, joyous at times.  This book should be a must read in every high school English class because it is so well crafted.  It should be required reading in History class because it explains what happened then, what is happening now and what shouldn't happen on our watch.
B000E9910W|4.0|Without saying so, what this 2-CD set includes is every Billboard chart single the Doobie Brothers ever notched - something no other album (except their boxed set) can boast. That means that 'Very Best Of' collects songs like 'Eyes Of Silver' (#52, 1974), 'I Cheat The Hangman' (#60, 1975), and 'Wheels Of Fortune' (#87, 1976) that were never included on similar previous collections. It even picks up 'Wynken Blynken and Nod' (#76, 1981) from the Sesame Street LP 'In Harmony.' And, two key non-hits ('Rockin' Down The Highway' and 'South City Midnight Lady') get tossed in, plus some stuff from the group's latter day albums.<br /><br />What you don't get are enough of the Doobies' great album tracks like 'Spirit' (1974) or 'Nothin' But A Heartache' (1977). For those, you'll need to upgrade to the boxed set - which nevertheless omits 'Without You,' a perennial favorite previously included on 'Best Of The Doobies' and 'Greatest Hits.' Go figure....
B000I5X81K|5.0|I purchased this CD,without knowing or hearing the songs first, because my wife had listened to the one Hallmark sold as a promo. This is excellent,easy and pleasant to listen to.  Makes her want to crank it up and sing along to the songs (the English ones anyway) while riding along in your car!She recommends it highly.
0792839749|5.0|This is a wonderful film for small children, and adults will be pleasantly surprised by how little it has dated.    I saw this film as a small child when it first came out and loved it.     Recently I was reminded how good the music of the film was when I happened apon the song \\"The Roses of Success\\" on the internet, and my two five-year old children appeared in my office in ten seconds flat to see what Daddy was listening to. So I thought I would get them the DVD.    This DVD has held the twins' attention for several playings. They are listening to it as I write and it has finally taken them out of their mother's hair after an afternoon in which they had been driving her, and consequently me, to distraction. The acting was brilliant, the special effects had dated far less than is usual for a film of this vintage, and the music was as good as I had remembered.    The orignal books were written by Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond, and were quite dark in tone. The film version is a light musical comedy.    Dick van Dyke plays Caractacus Potts, a poverty stricken inventor, and a widower with two small children. He buys and rebuilds a famous former racing car, which his children name Chitty Chitty Bang Bang after the distinctive noise made by the car's exhaust. (If a forty year old memory of reading the books as a child is accurate, Fleming put a note in the books to the effect that there really had been a famous racing car which had this nickname.)    The Potts family meet Truly Scruptious (Sally Ann Howes) daughter of the local sweet magnate Lord Scruptious (James Robertson Justice.) After they get off to a bad start, she tries to help Caractacus Potts raise the money to restore the car. After initial plans to raise money fall through, Caractacus gets the necessary funds by pure chance.    Restoration completed, Caractacus takes his children to the beach and again they join up with Truly Scrumptious. He tells his children an imaginary story about a wickedforeign potentate, Baron Bomburst (Gert Frobe) with a wife who hates children (Anna Quayle). The Baron wants to steal this wonderful car - a car which can turn into a boat, and also fly. His agents first try to steal the car, then kidnapp Caractacus's father Grandpa Potts (Lionel Jeffries). The viewer is caught up in the story.     Most people will know the ending but I'm not going to give it away for those who don't.    Excellent performances from van Dyke, Howes (was she really 38 years old when this was made?), Lionel Jeffries and James Robertson Justice. Other cast members included Benny Hill (\\"The Toymaker\\"), Max Wall, and Barbara Windsor (her character is called simply \\"Blonde\\" - I think this was made before she became famous in the Carry On films). Roald Dahl and Ken Hughes did the screenplay.    Perhaps the most memorable part of the film is Richard M Sherman's wonderful music and lyrics.

B00009V7P8|5.0|Why didn't anybody introduce me to Damien Rice years ago? This album is an all-time favorite.
B000286S8S|3.0|I can remember one day in late 1978, hearing Van Halen's (Eruption) and the entire first album scream out of the speakers of my buddies' borrowed record player in our 8th grade locker room during our half hour lunch break.  I couldn't believe what I was actually hearing, but ever since that time I was hooked on Van Halen and I have every album they have ever put out. Yes, even the disappointing Van Halen III.  Except for a couple songs, Van Halen III was very difficult to listen to, and I wonder what they were thinking when they got rid of Sammy after several great albums with the infamous \\"Red Rocker\\".  Anyway, back to 1978 and the David Lee Roth era through 1984.  They were the hottest rock band around.  Unfortunately, I was unable to ever see them perform live with David Lee on vocals but since then, I have seen them a half-a-dozen times with Sammy and they all have been fantastic live shows. I also own both of their live concert videos and love to watch Eddie's solo guitar performances which, in my opinion, are second to none.  Yes, there have been other great guitarists before Eddie: Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Stevie Ray Vaughan, just to mention a few, but in my opinion, no one before, and no one since, has been as innovative, creative and just down right the \\"Best of the Best\\" as Eddie Van Halen on guitar.  He will always be #1 in my book of top Rock guitar players of all-time.      Alas, back to the album at hand.  I actually give this album 5 stars for quality of songs, because some of these songs are some of the best Rock-n-Roll songs of all time.  But I give whoever put this record together a NEGATIVE 5 stars as for the order in which the songs were compiled and they left out at least another 5 to 10 songs that could have, and should have been included on \\"Best of Both Worlds\\".  I have listed my ultimate Van Halen song collection below.  Therefore, I have to rate this album as an average compilation of Van Halen Songs.  First of all, I wish they would have put the songs in chronological order starting with Van Halen I continuing down through the years, and then saved the three newest songs with Sammy for last, (of which shouldn't be on the album in the first place, because they are definitely not the \\"Best\\" that Van Halen has to offer)  But if they are going to be included in this disc set, they should have been the last three songs of the disc, so that when you got to end you could push stop, or eject if you didn't want to sit through them.  This album never gets into a rhythm due to this non-chronological order of songs.  Also, I would like to have seen a little more homage paid to David Lee Roth.  Even if he is one of the fruitiest \\"Nuts\\" you'll ever see, you have to admit he was one heck of a Front man back in his prime, and sang some of Van Halen's greatest songs.     This is the song set that I would have compiled, had I been the producer on this \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" project.    Disc 1: (David Lee Roth) Eruption, Runnin' With The Devil, You Really Got Me, Ain't Talkin' Bout Love, Jamie's Crying, Feel Your Love Tonight, Little Dreamer, Ice Cream Man, Dance The Night Away, Beautiful Girls, And The Cradle Will Rock, Everybody Wants Some, In A Simple Rhyme, Mean Street, Unchained, Where Have All The Good Times Gone, Cathedral, Secrets, Pretty Woman, Dancing In The Street, Little Guitars (intro), Little Guitars, 1984, Jump, Panama, Drop Dead Legs, Hot For Teacher, I'll Wait.    Disc 2: (Sammy Hagar) Why Can't This Be Love, Dreams, Summer Nights, Best of Both Worlds, Love Walks In, 5150, When It's Love, Cabo Wabo, Feels So Good, Finish What Ya Started, Black And Blue, Poundcake, Runaround, Right Now, 316, Top of The World, Can't Stop Lovin' You, Don't Tell Me What Love Can Do, Amsterdam, Not Enough, Take Me Back (Deja Vu), Feelin'.    Van Halen will always be one of my favorite groups, if not my favorite rock-n-roll group of all time.  It's too bad the Van Halen brothers can't put their egos aside, getover themselves and get back together with one of, if not both of, two of the greatest front men of all time.  And don't forget Michael Anthony, maybe not the greatest bass man of all time, but he sure puts on an excellent live show and bass solo, and you have to love his Jack Daniels bass guitar, (it's a classic, just like Eddie's red, black and white striped guitar) plus he sings great harmony in his own right.  And you can't leave out Alex Van Halen on drums.  When you bring up Van Halen, everyone immediately talks about Eddie's unbelievable guitar playing, but Alex is one of the top ten drummers of all time as well.  Just as Michael Anthony, Alex puts on an excellent live drum solo, it's just that he has been overshadowed by his brother's guitar playing...in any other band Alex would be the star.      Now wouldn't that be an awesome tour.  The Van Halen brothers with Michael Anthony together with both David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar doing all of their hits respectively in one live show.  Now that would  definitely be what you could call the \\"BEST OF BOTH WORLDS\\"!!!
B000JLSM00|3.0|It is a tragedy that Warner Bros has gone to so much trouble to preserve John Ford's greatest film (and thus at least one of the ten greatest films of all time) in this version. Don't get me wrong - Bluray is dazzling. I bought a player just to see this DVD and believe incredible trouble was gone to to master in 6K and \\"future proof\\" this important classic. But it's the future I worry about because somewhere around the time of the so called \\"Ultimate\\" version of this very great film, somebody decided to \\"fix\\" the look of it and bring its 8 perforation Vistavision and Technicolor (arguably superior to 70mm) into line with 2 perforation ultra cheap spaghetti westerns and the like and the work of director Ford and cinentaographer Winton Hoch who won the Oscar a couple of years earlier with 'THE QUIET MAN' is to be handed to future generations in this inferior facsimile, not just of the original (which I've seen in Technicolor) but Warners' earlier DVD release (regrettably not on Bluray), which was superb. Compare just the opening title frame (they do so at DVD Beaver) and you'll see what I mean.  <br />I am very grateful to those who went to so much trouble, but please when you come to the MGM library of classics like 'THE WIZARD OF OZ' trust the original film makers and don't try to fix somthing that ain't broke.
1591396190|4.0|The strategy framework described in Blue Ocean is interesting and thoughtful.  But the best parts of this book were the case studies on successful organizations who had exploited uncontested market space: Cirque De Soleil, NetJets, Yellow Tail, the NYPD are a few of the examples.  Its not clear if they actually used a Blue Ocean Strategy or if their strategies were used as research to develop the framework in this book; but it is clear that the chronicled companies came up with innovative strategies.
B000FS9FC6|3.0|A good movie that sticks it to the government for its behind door ways of secrets against society for it own leaders moral purposes in the name of greater humanity.  Secreat human experiments done like in the real life case of black unbeknown being given syphillis and then with experimental cures. Well one guy got mad as hell and wasn't going to take it anymore. Portman and Hugo create good chemistry with a detective having he own second thoughts towards the government leadership.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|After spending the past three days trying unsuccessfully to locate a rental copy of The Holiday, I broke down and purchased one yesterday.  My wife and I seldom buy movies, as the vast majority are quite forgettable and would only gather dust on a shelf.  The first comment my wife made after the credits finished rolling was, \\"Wow! I am so glad that we bought it!\\"  I completely agree.  To our way of thinking, it is a classic romantic comedy deserving of mention in the same breath as \\"When Harry Met Sally,\\" \\"Pretty Woman,\\" or \\"Sleepless in Seattle.\\"  I have no idea why it did not garner more critical acclaim or box office success.  The acting, directing, and entire production were wonderful.  Without question, this movie deserves a \\"5-star\\" rating and a place in my very small permanent movie collection!
B0002JP4L4|5.0|An American classic dance movie. Also watch the special 2-part feature on the making of the movie. It was forward and backward looking in so many good ways, anticipating the break out of pop music into mainstream culture through MTV as well as telling the story of a real small town in Oklahoma which had banned dancing for 95 years before one senior class petitioned the town fathers for a prom.  <br /> <br />Although it contains some clichés, then, the story is still a meaningful one, and the very human performance of John Lithgow as the baptist minister and father of the rebellious Lori keeps the filim from descending into stereotype. Of course, Kevin Bacon in the lead role of \\"Ren\\" is just riveting. The dancing, choreographed by Lynne Taylor-Corbett, is good but not too good. Although there are clearly some ringers in the film (which makes the extravaganza closing scene just that much more fun), for the most part she worked with the native talents of the actors she had, who were not professional dancers. Just an all-around fun movie with foot-tapping music.
B000FDFVZ6|4.0|When my sister handed me a copy of this book and told me I just had to read it, I have to admit I was very skeptical.  She and I have different tastes in books and movies.  I brought the book home with me and left it on my desk as I was already in the middle of another book.   <br /> <br />A few days later, I finished my book and picked up The Lovely Bones to see what it was about.  Heaven.  This is a topic I almost always avoid.  I opened the book to the first page, and was gently ushered into the story by the narrator, Susie Salmon.  This tone protects the reader from the chilling events that set the novel in motion.  In spite of the fact that the narrator is young, she is calm and kind and we begin to care about her and her family immediately. <br /> <br />A book based on the premise of a young girl in heaven looking down on life and her loved ones has so much potential to be trite, melodramatic, and religious.  This book, fortunately, is none of those things.  It is an interesting story from a new type of perspective.  I enjoyed this book.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Although this film is a bit long for its subject matter, it is awe inspiring and nothing more than brilliant.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale carry this film perfectly as rivaling magicians seeking revenge upon one another.  You couldn't demand a better cast.  And who doesn't like Michael Caine in anything?  There's no way this film was going to fail with these 3 leads.  David Bowie is also surprisingly good in his role as Telsa.<br /><br />It's been years since I've seen THAT kind of film that keeps you totally guessing till the end.  I don't even know what I would compare The Prestige to, but think about how you felt at the end of The Sixth Sense when the truth was revealed, or when you found out the cop was the bad guy in Ransom.  THIS movie is exactly like that, but only better.<br /><br />The characters do a good job of showing you something else to make you forget what you are supposed to be looking out for.  Then the truth, or reveal, smacks you hard in the face.  It gives you that \\"A-ha!\\" feeling that you would indeed feel when being fooled by a real magician.  Some of the tricks' secrets are revealed which will have you saying, \\"I always wondered how they did that!\\"<br /><br />The color and tone of this film definitely makes it a period piece so if you enjoy those type films, you will love this one.  Like I said, it can be a bit slow in places but those moments did seem important to the film  overall and didn't bore me.  Definitely a film that keeps you guessing till the end.  All three elements of magic, including an amazing prestige, are here for your enjoyment!<br /><br />Watch closely!
0446693804|5.0|When this book arrived I sat down and read it cover to cover in 4 hours. It had my attetion the whole time. It is different than the movie, but both stories are great. There are not enough stories on people with strong character. I will read it again, no doubt.
B000J10EQU|5.0|Bryan Singer has true talent for bringing comic book characters to the big screen!  He proved that with the first two X-Men films.  He definitely does NOT disappoint with his Superman debut.  Singer wanted an \\"unknown\\" to play the lead, in much the same way Reeves was chosen years ago to play the caped crusader.  Brandon Routh is perfect.  He is respectable to what we, the audience, expect from Superman, a bit of a tribute to Reeves in his looks and demeanor, but he also applies something new to the role as if we are seeing Superman for the first time ever.<br /><br />The special effect scenes are not too over the top, so this doesn't become an action-packed thriller that leaves you stunned but bored.  The first real big scene involving the airplane will have you hooked. The story line is solid and it is what it is, picking up right where the last Superman movie left off practically.  Clark comes back and is trying to gel back into the scene at the paper.  Lane has a kid and a steady boyfriend.  And boom...Superman is back to save the country from Lex, played by Kevin Spacey.  There is nothing \\"too new\\" about the story, except for the actors themselves, so SM fanatics can definitely appreciate it.  Clips of Marlon Brando as SM's father are even used as a tribute to the early films.<br /><br />With as many over-the-top, action packed, cheap thrills, bad acting, and poor story lines for movies that are cluttering up the big screens these days, Superman Returns definitely saves the day for us moviegoers.  You have to appreciate this film for its new edge on the comicbook take, but also for the good old true fashion values it brings to the overall theme of Superman the character that we've come to appreciate throughout the years.<br /><br />Christopher Reeves would be proud! And Routh is signed on for at least two sequels, so there is more brilliance to come!
1582701709|3.0|This book was touted by Oprah, I hear.  My sister called to tell me about it.  I rushed and ordered it from Amazon.  I read through alot of it and while there is some good stuff in there, I think you would have to be a complete moron to not have discovered alot of the philosophy behind the book.  I think it is worthy as food for thought and maybe some people haven't discovered these things already for themselves, but it really is not anything life-changing for me anyway.  Some of it was pretty hokey, as well.  Glad I didn't pay the 24 or so bucks they want for it on their website!
B000B8QG4A|4.0|Very happy to get the movie prior to it going back to the vault. Enjoyable to watch.
B00005JO20|1.0|Painfully long. Too many scenes drawn out that you squirm waiting for them to end.  It's awful.  <br /> <br />This is NOT a fun movie except for the parts that are so ridiculously stupid like men outrunning  <br />dinosaurs or King Kong ice skating in NYC.   <br /> <br />It's dark and scary and filled with images that are certain to bring nightmares to children. <br /> <br />All the CGI tricks used to make this mess still doesn't save it.  It's a bad movie.  <br />Some of the CGI is great - and some is surprisngly bad. <br /> <br />Kong 2005 is badly written and directed by a self-indulgent movie-maker. <br />  <br />The 1933 and 1976 versions of King Kong were better by far. <br /> <br />Life is too short to waste watching stuff like this.
B000M4RG42|5.0|Excellent Film. Clint Eastwood left Hollywood out of the movie. I would <br />highly reccomend reading the book also. James Bradley goes into much detail of each of the flag raisers personalities and character. The book <br />puts the film into focus.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|We ordered this DVD for St. Patrick's Day and did not once regret it. Audio tracks of Celtic Woman are invaluable, but boy, it was something watching Mairead play \\"Granuaile's Dance\\" and the girls singing, dancing and lovin' the music! Special features include \\"Behind the Scenes,\\" which allows you to get a glimpse of all the hard work that made this gorgeous production come true. Definitely a must for every fan.
1591840562|5.0|This is a wonderful book on starting things, not just companies, but also non-profits and new ventures within existing organizations. I wish I had this book 10 years ago!<br /><br />I've been in three startups, intimately involved in two others, advised quite a few more, and read plenty of additional business plans. Guy has lots of words of wisdom, as well as some rather unorthodox thoughts. I often smiled while reading and thought, \\"yup we got that wrong.\\"<br /><br />From the very beginning there is (perhaps seemingly simple yet) profound advice.<br /><br />\\"The hardest thing about starting is getting started\\" - I've had friends who have planned and schemed for years but never actually started.<br /><br />\\"You should always be selling - not strategizing about selling.\\" Yes, seen that done a lot.<br /><br />Some of his unorthodox advice: On business models, \\"ask women - and only women. My theory is that deep in the DNA of men is a killer gene.\\" He believes men are likely to have a business model which is \\"kill competitor XYZ\\" and women are not. I've certainly known companies whose business model was kill company XYZ, for example Sun Microsystem's desire to kill Microsoft. I find this advice bizarre, although thought provoking.<br /><br />The entire book - every chapter - is useful. I've underlined many passages and written copious notes in the back. I've not only read the book, but also gone back and reread many parts as well as skimming it in its entirety.
B00005JPFQ|4.0|After the spaghetti westerns of Ennio Morricone or Sergio Leone or Clint Eastwood, we had to have a gruesome living dead western sooner or later. And here is one that goes beyond all imaginable limits with Mephistopheles, his son, though we don't know his mother who could be any shady lady in the world, and a ghostrider in the wings of a desolate megapolistic urban neighborhood, the expected horse being replaced by another metal horse of some kind, a motorbike, and that enables Peter Fonda to come up from his grave in Easy Rider and nostalgically become the master of ceremony of this hell's angelic mess. Apart from that, the film is filled with too many special effects for it to be effective, too much fire for it to be hot enough to sear our minds with fear or thrill, too simplistic human relations and satanic tricks for us to be in anyway impressed. It is frankly impossible to rewrite Goethe's Faust, or Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, or any impersonification of the devil, in such a blind alley of a dead end impasse. It leads nowhere and redemption in this context means the end of the film and a sigh of relief when the lights come back on and we can go home for a nightcap, the first excitement of the evening.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Regarless of your views on Gore or global warming one thing is true. WE ARE WASTEFUL. Somehow people do not understand that simple true fact. Travel anywhere else on the planet...anywhere ...and you will agree. That is what it comes down to. Today the latest is global warming but our need for everything now will eventually end up poorly for our planet, one way or another. WE should just reduce our needs just based on one of Gore's graphs in this film. We consume more than many continents put together!! THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH!
B00003CWN3|5.0|A very disquieting film that tells a story that seems so unreal that we need to discover, at the very end of it, the fate of the protagonists to believe it is a true story. It is first of all a story about the gender identity of a girl, Teena Brandon, who sees herself as a boy and wants to behave as one, to be one. She manages to go through it all and falls in love with a girl who falls in love with her too, thinking she is a boy. So far so good. But what will happen when her real identity comes out? And that is the drama. The brothers or local boys of the neighborhood of the girl who has fallen in love with Teena Brandon decide to take justice in their own hands. First they teach a lesson to that Teena and rape her ruthlessly. But this ends up in the sheriff's office and that is only the beginning of the end. Then the two boys decide to expedite real justice and they kill Teena along with another girl, and mother, that happens to be there at the wrong moment with her baby. The two culprits will be taken to court, tried, convicted and sentenced. But what can we do with such a tragedy? How can it be possible in our modern world that a gender crisis in the mind of a girl may cause such disorder among the people around her? How come the boys react so violently whereas the girls or even older women seem to be a lot more tolerant? What makes such a gender crisis so dramatic? There is no real answer and simple male bigotry is not enough to explain such events. Is malehood such a privilege, such an unsharable dignity that any woman who will desire to assume some of it for herself will turn the surrounding men into criminals? We are dealing here with sex or gender fetishism. But how come it is stronger among men than among women? Or would it be the same in reverse if a boy tried to assume a female identity? I am not sure. Men must feel particularly menaced by the gender wavering of a female who could thus penetrate the secret citadel of malehood without being a member of the brotherhood. Is it really an old story? Definitely not. It could happen again any time, and I would even say it does happen all the time here or there, openly but probably most of the time unknown of anyone because self-censored by the \\"culprit\\" of such wavering.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonnee brotherhood.

B000ION79Y|1.0|The Seagal voice dubbing was atrocious. Almost 75% of the movie of Seagal's voice was dubbed over with another voice that didn't even sound like his. I thought the DVD was defective. In fact, even some of the bit actor's voices didn't match their lips moving. It was painful to follow and hard to watch with the bad dubbing. Don't waste your money !!!!! <br />How could they release something so blatantly bad ???
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|This edition is loaded with extras. I spent a day watching it three times: once with the commentary by the official historians, once with the actors' commentaries, and once with James Cameron's commentary. It was a completely different film each time. <br /> <br />The film was groundbreaking in the new technology it devised for special effects as well as the benefit it gave to marine archaeology in the use of it's obscene Hollywood budget to provide technology previously unavailable to scientists.  <br /> <br />As a long time casual student of Titanic, I am continually impressed by the film's attention to detail particularly in regard to historical accuracy regarding the ship. <br /> <br />As a love story, it is so wonderful only because he died. They would have been divorced within the year otherwise. Ignore that trite, cliched relationship and enjoy the stunning cinematics and attention to detail that will ensure that this film remains a classic.  <br /> <br />If you don't buy the special edition, you'll wish you had... <br /> <br />
B000000P17|5.0|I was always more a fan of Slash's guitar work and tone on the GNR albums than of the songs themselves (with a few notable exceptions).  In my opinion, guitar-wise, this album is way more 'raw' and 'gritty' than the others.  Slash's solos are absolutely perfect and full of emotion (Ain't It Fun being a good example), and his rhythm playing is devastating.  It's hard not to smile listening to the menacing opening of 'Down on the Farm' or 'Black Leather'.  Through and through this album just kicks, with none of the over-produced feel of the UYI albums.  Axl's voice is in top shape as well and the choice of songs here provides a wide array of musical styles (still punk though), resulting in a very well-rounded album.  That's why, ironically, the only non-original Guns N Roses album is also my favourite.
B00005JPLU|5.0|This movie is incredible, the action is excellent , if only \\"Troy\\" and \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" did fight sequencs like this , it would make the movie's worth watching more than once (not saying I didnt like them, I own them but have only watched once),maybe its the action ,maybe it's the great story or maybe it's Gerald Butler's excellent delivery in his line's (he is awesome to watch in this film), but I have gone to see this movie 3 times since it's release, once by myself the day it came out cause I couldnt wait ,then with my Dad, then with friends, and I still can't wait to see it again, but I will wait till it come's to DVD or Blu-ray.The music is great and so are all the actor's. \\"My Queen , My Wife , My Love,\\"-Leonidas, Great scene.

Catching the diva on many television promotional stops made me need the \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" cd.Thenit wasonly a matterof waiting for the Tour dvd. I love it!  The energy isinfectious, almost enough toget this 60-year old disabled guy up and moving.Madonna's dancers and crew are a thrill to see in action; however, this is clearly Madonna's Magnum Opus.She looks and sounds terrific.I highly recommend this set.NOTE: Do crank up the volume!
B000002KBU|5.0|As a high schooler, I was introduced to Joni Mitchell 'Songs to a Seagull' by a classmate (who is now CFO of Microsoft!).  I was entranced by the beauty of 'Chelsea Morning' and pleased to be an insider to the source of 'Both Sides Now' and 'Circle Game'.  It was the beginning of a love affair that has spanned decades.<br /><br />I call 'Blue' my life soundtrack because circumstances placed me in a position in my life where the relevance of Ms. Mitchell's lyrics to my life was uncanny, to say the least.<br /><br />At 24 years of age, I found myself in Ireland over the holidays.  I had left my Chicago home to start a new life there, and ran into disillusionment and homesickness.  Listening to 'River' - \\"it don't snow here, it stays pretty green, I'm gonna make a lot of money and I'm gonna quit this crazy scene. Oh, I wish I had a river, that I could skate away on\\" I found myself in that exact situation.  Weirdly prophetic?  Auto-suggestion?<br /><br />No, just a perceptive artist who took her own experiences and feelings and wove them into a tapestry of blue.  Truly, this is one of the masterpieces of the 20th Century.
1582701709|4.0|Like everybody else, I love the movie. (my hair stylist told me about it a few months before it was on Oprah!)  But I was really excited about the book because it's portable.  You can carry it with you on the go.  The dvd is great, but I can't really watch it during the day.  So my copy is in my work bag.  It's like constant reminder about the power of attraction.  I can touch it and flip through it for instant inspiration any time. <br /> <br />ps:  if you like the \\"Secret\\" ideas and haven't read Laura Day's \\"The Circle\\" I can't recommend it highly enough.  It's one of my all time favorites (I love ALL Laura Day's books) because it gives you specific tools on how to use the power of attraction in a real way - visualization exercises, etc.  It's excellent!
0452282152|5.0|This is for anyone who has ever wandered through a museum and wondered about the people whose images are displayed there.  Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring gazes at the viewer over her shoulder as if she had been interrupted on her way to someplace else.  She is a young woman, her head wrapped in an improbable manner with richly colored cloth, not at all the typical style of the day.  She has no other ornaments or signs of wealth other than a large pearl earring.  The background of the painting is blocked out, as if she were standing just outside of a gaping void leaving the viewer to focus on her large dark eyes and single jewel.  There are few historical records of Vermeer's life and no information on the identity of his young model.   <br /> <br />Chevalier has taken the inspiration of this painting to tell a story of young Griet whose family had been comfortably well off until her father was blinded at work.  Now it was up to Griet to provide for her family, at least until her brother completed his apprenticeship.  Griet was sent to work as a made for the ever expanding household of the painter Jan Vermeer. <br /> <br />The reader is shown Dutch society and the city of Delft through the eyes of 16 year old Griet.  She misses the happier days of her childhood with her brother and sister and fears her future.  As a young woman of the lower middle class she knows that her best hope for the future, her only hope for a respectable future, is to marry well.  She is also quite aware that working as a maid has drastically lowered her status in the community and made her prospects for a good marriage unlikely.  Added to these worries are the ones unique problems of the Vermeer household, the power struggles among Vermeer, his wife and mother-in-law, the need to please a difficult patron and the ever increasing size of the household.  Chevalier has done a masterful job bringing the various characters to life.  This would be an excellent book to assign to high school orlower level college students, either in literature classes or as a supplement to history courses.  Chavlier, through Griet, give the reader an idea of the challenges facing a young woman growing up in a society that offered few opportunities to women.
B00024I2Z4|3.0|Being Chinese, I really wanted to love this movie, but it lacks a few key story elements that set \\"Masterpiece\\" animated features such as 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Aladdin' apart from the rest. The animation and sound are fine as they should be and the mountain pass scenes are really cool, especially the part where the huge Mongol hoard comes charging down towards the protagonists in an endless wave of cavalry. The main musical theme \\"Reflections\\" is also well written and expresses Mulan's feelings and desires with emotion. <br /> <br />My issues with the movie: <br /> <br />1) The bad guy is certainly bad. He looks bad and he acts bad. However, there isn't really any clear logic or motivation to why he is doing what he's doing. In Beauty and the Beast, Gaston is driven by his egomaniacal desire to have Belle, the one woman in the village who shows no interest in him at all. In Mulan, the bad guy rapes and pillages China because... well... just because. There doesn't appear to be any goal or motivation for him. He destroys simply because he can, which is certainly possible, but makes for a rather flat character. Gaston, Jafar, and Ursula are much more interesting villains. <br /> <br />2) Mulan's romantic partner is kind of a \\"himbo\\". He's a pretty boy who doesn't really do much and isn't all that bright. It's not clear to me why Mulan would really want to get together with him other than the fact that he's a good looking dude. Besides that, he doesn't add much to the story. Which leads to my next issue: <br /> <br />3) In the other great Disney features, the lead and their romantic interest share in the resolution of their conflicts and defeat the villian as part of the resolution of the conflict in their romance. In Aladdin, Jasmine and Aladdin battle Jafar together as part of the resolution of the problem where Aladdin lied about being a poor street kid because Jasmine is the Sultan's daughter. Ariel and Eric battle Ursula as part of the romantic conflict brought on by the fact that he is human and she is a mermaid. Eric sees that Ariel is a mermaid in the end and doesn't care. He still risks his life fighting Ursula together with Ariel. In Mulan, it's pretty much just her and the romantic part of the story is an afterthought and they never really get into the issue of resolving that she is \\"doing a man's job\\" and shouldn't be in the Chinese army as part of their romantic conflict. It just gets OK'd in the end because she saves the emperor. They don't resolve it between themselves as individuals. Actually, up until the end he still does not accept her until the emperor accepts her. Not very romantic. <br /> <br />4) Finally, the supporting characters don't add much to the story either. The dragon and cricket add a little comedy here and there, but not much else. Some of the soldiers in Mulan's unit had potential, but don't really fully get there. <br /> <br />So, overall I liked the movie, but I didn't love it. This could have been one of their classics if they spent a bit more time developing the story and characters. It looks great, but needed some more under the hood of the story.
6304806426|1.0|Having watched this film three times since 1996,I keep revisiting it hoping that maybe something in me would change to make me like this film more,but it hasn't!!!When a movie wins nine Academy Awards I think,maybe the \\"intelligentia\\" knows better.They don't!!!This film is positively plodding. The acting or the screenplay is not anything exceptional in any way.(No small wonder that Fiennes and Scott-Thomas were beat out!)I am a person who is usually moved by what I see,but the more I view this picture,the more I realize why the SEINFELD show dedicated a whole episode to their hate of this movie.When I revisit the nominees for 1996 I see what a weak field this film was up against,but certainly FARGO,SHINE,SECRETS AND LIES and even JERRY MAGUIRE were more compelling than this 3-hour bore.To each his/her own.You will either love it or hate it.I preferred the latter vehemently!

B0001CNRSE|3.0|The only thing that (somewhat) seperates this \\"beautiful star has good intentions for her 'people in the hood'\\" film is that the racial lines are clearly drawn and somewhat offending, somewhat comical.<br /><br />We meet Honey Daniels, who is a Hip Hop Dance instructor at the Community Center by afternoon and a Bartender by night that uses her \\"after hours\\" at the club to show off her moves. And, as we all seen coming, she meets a video producer one night at the club who offers her the opportunity she's been waiting for: to choreograph and dance in a music video.<br /><br />Things on going well until the produce (a goofy looking white boy) puts on the moves on Honey and she shoots him down.  And, as expected, this same producer fires her, along with the 'hood kids she got dance parts for in the new video, and hires her dance-archenemy, Katrina.<br /><br />Honey is so broken hearted; not about her loss, but the loss of those poor kids.  So she decides to do something about it: she wants to open her own dance studio.  Yet she lacks the funds to get off the ground.<br /><br />Never one to be pessimistic, Honey devises a plan to raise the money: a dance benefit.  She's out pumpin' the neighborhood for donations while, in the meantime, that silly, oversexed white boy of a producer is preparing to produce a new video for Missy Elliot.  Elliot shoots the producer down when she finds out her video is going to be choreographed by Katrina (who Elliot describes as a thief of M.C. Hammer's moves) instead of Honey.<br /><br />Just when Honey thinks she may have a tough go of raising the dough, that goofy lookin' boy pops up again and this time he's begging and pleading and apologizing to Honey trying to get her to come back to work for him.  This time, she bursts his little bubble with a resounding \\"No!\\"<br /><br />It's a story that has been done one too many times.  As with all the rest, it was okay but will never be ranked as a favorite. I'd recommend it only when cable offers nothing else; you know, like when it's those wee morning hours and there's nothing but infomercials...that's a good time!when cable offers nothing else; you know, like when it's those wee morning hours and there's nothing but infomercials...that's a good time! <br />
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Oldboy is, in my opinion, one of the well-made films I've ever seen.  Park Chan-wook has developed a magnificent way of storytelling, filled with visceral and disturbing images that work effectively toward the overall.  The idea of an ordinary man abducted and torn from his family only to be locked in a cheap hotel room for 15 years FOR NO APPARENT REASON is genius.  He has five days to figure out why this was done to him and exact his revenge.  I'd say that any smart Hollywood scriptwriter is probably mashing his brains on how to spin this into a US blockbuster (I don't blame them: the Indian film Zinda already ripped it off).   <br /> <br />The acting was top-notch, especially Choi Min-sik's Oh Dae-su character.  I think he totally killed in this role (betcha didn't know that octupus he ate was actually REAL?!), and the supporting roles of his tormentor and his lover were also very good.  Park knows how to pick his actors and evidently can motivate them to do any role, no matter how disturbing the matrerial. <br /> <br />Obviously, I don't want to divulge the secret that this tale has to tell.  After all, it is the secret that drives this entire story and will bring audiences to a nerve-shattering but satisfying climax.  The DVD is filled with special features, but I suspect that the special metal box edition is certainly the must-have for any fan of this film.  Either way, I don't think anyone would be disappointed in purchasing this movie.
B00005JPLU|5.0|Never have I seen the array of washboard abdominals as displayed by a band of 300 Spartan warriors, as in the flick \\"300\\", based on Frank Miller's graphic novel.  Using computer enhancement and super slo-mo director Zack Snyder accentuates the blood and gore of the fabled Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C.<br /><br />Scotsman Gerard Butler who cuts an authoritative figure as the buffed Spartan king Leonidas, is coaxed into battle defending his homeland from the vast invading Persian hoardes.  Led by Xerxes played by a pierced, bejeweled Rodrigo Santoro, complete with plucked eyebrows, the Persian demi-god fails to understand the mindset of the militaristic Spartans.  Groomed for combat from birth, the Spartan does not know the meaning of surrender.<br /><br />Leonidas sacrifices a group of 300 soldiers who will allow the million plus Persian troops to funnel through a narrow seaside pass to be slaughtered by the superior fighting Spartans.<br /><br />The computer graphics and the dizzying battle scenes are breathtaking only to be somewhat reigned in by scenes of the politicking led by Queen Gorgo, played by Lena Headey, back home in Sparta.  It seems that Leonidas lead his troops into battle against the advice of their oracle and against the wishes of the ruling council.  While the dialogue is cluttered with corny cliches, the action sequences more than make up for that shortcoming.
B000O174CM|5.0|Dreamgirls is phenomenal, the performences, the music, and some lavish set designs make for one great movie. i still dont know why Dreamgirls was snubbed for Best Picture and Director, that to me is just one big Effie-sized shutout. but that still cant hurt the movies merit. the film, based on the popular Broadway show, tells of the Dreamettes, Deana Jones, Effie White, and Lorrell Robinson who have just been discovered by car salesman Curtis Taylor who is determined to make them famous. when the Dreamettes become backup singers for regional hotshot singer James \\"Thunder\\" Jones, there careers suddenly take of and soon, they become the Dreams. however, fame has its price as outspoken Effie begins to disrupt Cutris's plans until she's ousted compeltly and Deana is made lead singer. what follows is what the price of fame will do to best friends and to the ones they love. the music in the film is definenlty in vein with Motown, each number is just full of energy and flare you cant help but get up. all the actors are great but the standouts are definently Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy. Murphy redeems himself after some lackluster films and shows off dramatic chops he hasent bothered to used in years. it still baffels me he lost the Supporting Actor award. but it is Jennifer Hudson's Oscar winning role that steals the show, she totally embodies Effie with all her sass, heartache, and big voice, and i mean BIG voice. when she sings her solo \\"and i'm telling you i'm not going\\", she just brings the house down, no she actually destroys the house and sends chills up your spine. take that American Idol! so if you want to see one of the best films of the year, then Dreamgirls is the film for you.

1400064287|5.0|The ideas in this book are terrific. We kind of know some of Heath's principles: simplicity (well, we've heard about KISS forever), unexpectedness (there should be something shocking or at least edgy to make it dynamic,) concreteness (it can't be \\"mystery meat\\" you have be able to connect with the essence right away,) credibility (one has to get an initial feeling of \\"worthiness\\"), it has to excite, to have emotional as well as rational appeal, and stories help (well, we've heard about testimonials, and parables too). But here in this book Heath puts it all into focus so you have a concrete measuring scale to work with.<br /><br />He illustrates his points with some good examples. How do you get big, bad truckers to stop littering the State of Texas? \\"Give a hoot, don't pollute\\" is too tame for these macho guys. So state officials came up with the slogan \\"Don't mess with Texas\\" and did TV spots with such consummate Texans as Ed Jones of the Dallas Cowboys and country music's Willie Nelson.<br /><br />\\"Business managers seem to believe that, once they've clocked through a PowerPoint presentation showcasing their conclusions, they've successfully communicated their ideas,\\" Heath writes. \\"What they've done is share data\\" Sticky ideas shock, move and convince us. \\"If you want your ideas to be stickier, you've got to break someone's guessing machine and then fix it.\\"<br /><br />I had read about Heath's research in Cognitive Psychology, Psychology Today, and Scientific American. Unfortunately not before I made two big mistakes. But, thanks to what I have since learned, I think I have been able to correct them.<br /><br />I'm a board certified cognitive behavioral therapist who has had great success training people to re-wire their brains to quickly get out of the pain of depression by using simple mind exercises to switch their neural activity from the feeling part of the brain (the subcortex) to the thinking part of the brain (the neocortex). These exercises are based on neuroplasticity, the ability of the brain to re-wire itself as a result of changes in one's thinking and behavior. So far, so good.<br /><br />I called the process Directed Thinking, successfully presented my research before the National Board of Cognitive Behavioral Therapists, and got a trademark.

B000K7VHQE|2.0|Anyone who watched the Academy Awards this year must have noticed the look of surprise on Alan Arkin's face when he heard his name called as the winner of the Best Supporting Actor award. After watching the movie, I would feel safe in saying that his reaction was, perhaps, more one of embarrassment than surprise. One can only imagine what Djimon Hounson, Eddie Murphy and Mark Wahlberg must have been thinking - not to mention the rest of the audience. As great an actor as he is, I felt Arkin spent far too little time in this film to be singled out for any serious Osar consideration. Perhaps if anyone (or anything) in this film deserved to be nominated, it should have been the bus!  <br /> <br />That said, I personally found the film to be too slow-paced and rather boring - which, for the most part, matches the performances as well. The scrip was bland and couldn't hold my attention; twice while watching the film, I considered turning it off. However, considering all the buzz that surrounded it, I decided to follow it through. In the end, I found myself asking, 'so what was all the fuss about?' I also found it hard to believe that this film had been nominated for best picture.    <br /> <br />For an independent film to gather this much talent together and not produce a better product was a terrible waste. I find it hard to believe that it was nominated for anything, considering the level of competition it was up against. By the way, if you really want to see a great example of a performance by a best supporting actor,  watch \\"Sunshine's\\" Greg Kinnear in \\"As Good As It Gets.\\" It doesn't get any better than that. Kinnear was nominated for his performance, but, like the film's great writer-director, James L. Brooks, he was snubbed by Oscar that year. Snubbed this year were nominees for best original screenplay such as the writers of \\"Babel,\\" \\"Letters from Iwo Jima,\\" and \\"The Queen.\\" \\"Sunshine\\" won the oscar for that category, too. Go figure. Really makes you wonder whatthe Academy is thinking these days.
1400097029|2.0|...and I mean that in the most excruciating way.  I believe some writers get lost in the words and the construction of sentences before they realize that they don't have a plot.  So, with about 25 pages left, they throw in a twist, the pay-off, that has been projected, painfully, for a few hundred, tedious, ponderous, and stupefying pages.  I had just read 500 pages of Margaret Atwood's \\"The Blind Assassin\\", another Man Booker Prize winner with incredible writing, an unlikable narrator and a missing plot, before I picked up this John Banville novel.  Thankfully, it was, at least, short.  Ostensibly about death and the nature of memory, I found it to be meandering and confusing.  Obviously a terribly gifted writer, with sentences that beg to be read again and again, I just think that being able to manipulate words isn't enough to garner the praise it deserves, much less a Booker Prize.

B000KQGP2G|5.0|_The Perfect Element II_ was so long-awaited that now that it is upon us, it is hard to even associate it with the earlier release from 2000. Sidenote: i cant believe its been so long! Much has happened between then, including two other concept albums, including the controversial _Be_. I think it is more than just a psychological lack of recency effect -- almost at a metaphysical level, _Scarsick_ seems very distinct from its predecessor. Whether this is attributable to my own listening, the songwriting, atmosphere, or production of the album itself, it would be vain to speculate. Musical presuppositions about what something ought to be inhibit one from grasping the concrete musical item before oneself. Even the concept, which screams for commentary (like the fact that Gildenlow decries virtually everything that concerns the high time-preference of Americans/people in general, when he accepts the basic foundation of statism which produces those very high time-preference social conditions he hates; his love of the system of coercive redistribution that is democracy; his socialist preconceptions and hatred of free markets, et cetera), seems to be more concerned with lambasting materialism and wealth than following up with the story of the previous episode, but it could be argued that this has little to do with the musical experience itself.<br /><br />On that level, whether or not it works as a Perfect Element Part II for yourself, _Scarsick_ is a tremendous album that further distinguishes Pain of Salvation's unique contribution to prog-metal or prog-rock, or whatever one cares to call them (doesn't matter that much anyway). The production is a long way from TPE1, instead of muddy, low, and grimy (much like the story portrayed), it is clean and sharp, the many textures separated more nicely and individual voices being far clearer. This is the main reason the album sounds little like TPE1, in my view. TPE1 was an album with rather counterintuitive production quality, although that garbled sound was imperative to making TPE1 the awesome emotional experience that it is. Considering the production and the general characteristics of the songwriting (although speaking of \\"general characteristics\\" with POS is always a little tricky), it seems to evoke _Entropia_ more than TPE1. Also, the lack of strings or orchestration is notable because the first episode featured them, and there was much talk about TPE2 using a full orchestra. In my opinion, the lack thereof can be considered a positive thing. Additionally, the album is at about the same level of haviness, with a similar emphasis on primitive, pounding kind of riffing as TPE1.<br /><br />The album begins as if it is coming through strain, the title track having muttered verses, sort-of-but-not-quite rapped, and a chorus that seems to foreshadow the cathartic release towards the end of the album, with its `tribal' beats, and African-style backing vox. The awesome \\"Spitfall\\" is probably my favorite on the album, where Gildenlow's anger unfolds in a series of long, rapping verses over a polyrhythmic surge of drums and guitar crunch, with a recurring three-note descending piano figure. Their ever impressive ability to merge violent, churning spasms of heaviness with a perfect, major-key brilliance is reassured on the chorus. \\"Cribcaged\\" is an angry power-ballad, starting innocently enough with samples of laughing infants and bluesy guitars but by the end has Gildenlow roaring against materialistic pretense. \\"America\\" is seriously like a driving pop-punk anthem, except 50 times tighter and with pianos bounding along with the guitars, with Gildenlow sounding like all the pop-punk nerds and their phony british accents, histrionics included. Very good and catchy, probably the closest they would ever get to mainstream sounding. \\"Disco Queen\\" is a wild dichotomy of bouncy beats and wacky vocals throughout, but sharing its space with eerie theremin-like sounds, creepy growling bass, and sinister lyrics about abuse. Dancing to prog-metal never seemed so inviting, seriously (good things guys don't dance). Weird. The nice ballad \\"Kingdom of Loss\\" (no apparent lyrical or musical references to TPE1's \\"King of Loss\\") holds down the middle, condemning consumerism with a nice arrangement of synced guitar and synth, and spoken samples about lazy fat people who eat too much and never use the stairs. The next three cuts, \\"Modern Mother Mary\\", Ïdiocracy\\", \\"Flame to the Moth\\", have a similar aura about them, though they go from relatively straightforward to weird to raging, and they seem very _Entropia_-like with the classic POS schizoid lashes between styles and arrangements. The finale is the mighty closer, \\"Enter Rain\\" a lonely, angry, nocturnal episode in which slow verses of low-sung vocals with weeping guitar bends and austere arrangements build to impassioned bursts crunchy over an awesome chorus (Gildenlow's voice is awesome here). A serene, minimal interlude for solo guitar bridges the second chorus to third verse. A great POS closer, not quite \\"Plains of Dawn\\" but better than \\"Beyond the Pale\\", and pretty much on par with TPE1's title track. Nice. Then...to be continued?<br /><br />Perhaps there will be a TPE3, although one should not become too caught up in such things. Looking at the POS discography as a whole, there is persistent theme becoming clearer even over diverse, seemingly unrelated conceptual works. And for music the theme's value is not the theme itself, but the results produced by those inspired by it. There is a fire present here not heard from _Be_, which was in my view less impressive than their first four masterpieces. _Scarsick_ is intense and emotional and very much Pain of Salvation awesomeness, with no lags. Also superior in regards to _Be_ is a far more absorbing degree of unpredictability. Pain of Salvation is more easily seen outside prog-metal than inside it. Every release of theirs has the power to surprise, an appreciated ability few artists are capable of with experienced listeners.

B000M4RG42|3.0|I really wanted to love this movie. I love Clint Eastwood, and I love movies based on fact. Don't get me wrong, it is a good movie, and I did enjoy it, if only on a superficial scale. But maybe I was expecting something more, I wanted it to warm my heart, then tear it apart and eventually heal it again, but I didn't get that. The main characters just didn't engross me. I felt wanting more in the end. I still love Mr Eastwood and I'm looking forward to Letters from Iwo Jima.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|What film new Bond film did everyone else see that they are raving about it?  I own every other Bond film with the exception of this one(and boy, am I glad I rented it and didn't buy it).  Folks are noting that this is a realistic Bond -- where?  Was it during the Spiderman sequence as two man are scaling a construction site?  Oh, and the chase through a construction site (popping in and out of shafts and construction holes) apparently so perfectly choreographed that it may as well be \\"A Chorus Line.\\"  No one runs at top speed through a major construction site unscathed or unblocked shooting and skipping through unknown crevices, without slamming into some dangerous obstacle on the other side -- ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!  I would rather suspend belief and embrace an Alligator Submarine, an invisible car, a human jet-pack, or a mini-jet that exits from a Horse Carrier.  And, the gas tanker sequence, it may as well have been a Hook and Ladder chase through the streets of San Francisco (oh, that's right, that chase actually had me riveted!).  How convenient that Bond realized that the tanker windshield had been fully taken out, while his action sequence was in the back of the tanker -- in real life he would not have know that if he propelled himself from the top of the cab that he would land squarely next to the driver instead of banging off the front of the cab, unto the ground, and under the tires.  Bye bye Daniel Craig!  The film was about an hour too long.  Gimme Jaws and the good old days anytime because if this is the new Bond, it's time to find a new film icon.  Oh, that's right, Spiderman 3 is coming this summer and we'll see even more high-rise scaling displays.  At least I can believe that I superhero CAN DO THAT!  This Bond was realistic, realistically BAD!

B00005JPLU|3.0|Take a little of the silly, soft focus scenes from Gladiator, add a color palette reminiscent of Sin City, toss in a goofy actor in the lead (who yells a lot, but really can't pull it off -- he reminded me of that Monty Python skit about the guy who likes to shout), add enough blood, guts, and dismemberment to satisfy Mel Gibson, and there you have it. 300.  This movie is a comic book in the stereotypical sense -- a plot line even a five year old could follow, lots of bad lines meant to sound heroic and manly, lots of sweaty male bodies in impossibly good shape, and mayhem. What makes the film rise above a two star rating is the artistry of it. Frank Miller's artistic sense shines through in some gorgeous, but often gruesome, scenes. A feast, as it were, for the eyes and limbic system. It's fun, lightweight amusement, and a good way to vicariously relieve yourself of any anger you might have against your boss, teacher, sibling, or spouse.
B000QXDED6|4.0|Loosely based upon Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name, 300 is a retelling of the story of the 300 Spartans who withstood against the invading Persian army of King Xerxes at the Battle of Thermopylae. I have never read Miller's comic so I am unsure as to how closely the movie follows the comic, but the film opens with a prelude explaining what happened to Spartan men from the time they were born until the time the become men. The prelude tells of King Leonidas' experiences alone in the wild and how he faced a giant wolf in wild and defeated it single handedly by trapping it in a tight place. After the prelude the action moves to the city of Sparta before the war against the Persians began. King Xerxes has sent an emissary to Sparta to King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) to see if the Spartans will surrender their city to Persian control. If they do so, they are promised self-control, but as stewards and vassals to Xerxes. Leonidas responds by kicking the emissary down what appears to be a bottomless well and it is made clear that things don't look well for Sparta.<br /><br />As King, Leonidas goes to the Oracle to seek their blessing and any possible advice, but he instead finds corruption. The Oracle guardians won't allow the Spartan army to leave until after the upcoming religious festival. Leonidas won't be deterred; he knows that the future of Sparta and of all Greece depends on meeting the Persians in combat and keeping them at bay as long as possible. Of course, being a Spartan he's also looking for a fight because it's been a long time. So, in the Spartans go. In this version of the tale they are joined by a handful of Greeks from other cities who don't fight much and spend most of their time on the sidelines watching the Spartans plow through the Persian ranks. Despite being out numbered over 100 to 1, for awhile it appears that the Spartans might have a chance. But, then a traitor, Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan), tells Xerxes about a secret pass where he can surround the Spartans. After that there's not much left except death and glory.<br /><br />The Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae is an inspiring tale, but I was worried that since 300 is based on a work by Frank Miller (an author who has become famous for his nihilistic world view exposed largely through comic books), that it would be sapped of any inspiration and left hopeless in the end. I was surprised to find that this isn't the case with 300. Don't get me wrong, 300 is a dark and violent film. It has all kinds of Miller touches from turning the traitorous goat shepherd of history, Ephialtes, into a deformed hunchback of Spartan birth to the giant monsters employed by the Persian army. There's plenty of gore and titillating scenes of nudity to appeal to the teenage boys who will be eager to watch. The film also gets a few jibes in at religion. Yet, those things are just extras. The real story itself remains largely intact. The honor of the Spartans, the bravery they displayed, and the legacy they left to Greece and the rest of the Western World is not distilled. In fact, 300 is perhaps the most hopeful of all of Miller's works. Instead of ending at the Battle of Thermopylae, the story has an epilogue that concludes the tale at the Battle of Plataea where the Greeks decisively beat the Persian army and sent them out of their country for good.<br /><br />The movie is a visual feast of cinematography. The filmmakers followed a technique that gained prominence with SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW. The entire film was filmed on blue and green screens. Therefore, almost all of the visuals were created by computers (the bulging muscles of the Spartan warriors are a few of the exceptions--those are real and the actors underwent an intensive six-week course to prepare themselves). The color palette and overall visual look of the film is breathtaking. Turn the sound out and cut out most of the action scenes and 300 would still be a stunning work of art.<br /><br />There's not much to say in regards to acting. No one makes a stand out performance; though Gerard Butler makes a good Leonidas (Scottish actors portray royalty well). Besides the story itself and the overall look of the film, the next thing that stands out are the battles. The battles are well choreographed and take their cue from a wide variety of modern action films, such as THE MATRIX and THE LORD OF THE RINGS. The battle scenes don't break any new ground, but they help make this the type of film such as BRAVEHEART and GLADIATOR that men will watch over and over and over again.<br /><br />I enjoyed 300. It may not set any new ground and the story is as old as Western civilization, but it's a grand story, one that doesn't grow tired in the retelling no matter how many times you've heard or seen it.br />There's not much to say in regards to acting.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|I am not a gangster movie fan...I don't even know if I have seen other movies by this director.  I thought it looked like it would be a good movie just because I like Jack Nicholson.  I saw it prior to the whole Oscar thing and most of the time, I don't like the movies that recieve high honors in that arena.  I watched this movie (the first time) and got a little confused in the beginning because of the way it is set up, but I told myself \\"Just plow through it and hopefully it will make sense by the ending.\\"  I was right.  The ending blew me away.  The music is sooooooo awesome and got me into it right from the start.  I absolutely fell in love with Mark Walhberg and Leonardo DiCaprio in this movie.  This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time (I have since watched it 3 times now).  The whole good cop, bad cop storyline is so intriguing.  There are many questions I had at the end...but it didn't really matter.  The music, the acting and the plot gets you going from the start.  I can't say enough about this movie...watch it, listen to the soundtrack and enjoy!!!  Finally, a best picture that I think really deserved best picture.  And oh my, Jack Nicholson really is the coolest, badest, bad guy out there.

B000N3ST9I|5.0|Machine Head in full flight - in my opinion few bands can touch them for the pure metal epilepsy they induce. <br /> <br />Burn My Eyes is a metal classic. 5 stars, and if I could take 10 cd's out of my entire collection of over 400 metal only cd's it would be one of them. <br /> <br />I hold Machine Head to that album's standard.  <br /> <br />But I have been progressively disappointed with every release they have done since. Don't get me wrong, there have been some excellent tracks on those following releases, even if I hated Rob Flynn's devil horned turn-table hand rapping crap that existed on The Burning Red and Supercharger.  <br /> <br />Personally I felt their last album was good but not excellent. An improvement - and Imperium rules - a return to form and their third best album but not a patch on their first album. <br /> <br />This album is their best since Burn My Eyes. Easily. <br /> <br />It is heavy. Most of the songs are epic, 2 clock in at over 10 minutes, has riffs that will cause metal overload, has great solos and is distinctly Machine Head. The lyrics are cool and mostly Rob's screaming is spot on. Though his singing isn't... <br /> <br />That said, the song length is also a bit of a killer to some of the songs continuity. They tend to break down to mellower parts for too long which ruins the pace of the songs. But I AM a total thrash head...The mosh pit will cut sick to some of these tunes, but may be standing around for a couple of minutes during the breakdowns... <br /> <br />There is 1 track I hate on this CD and this is due to the chorus. Halo - in which every second line in the chorus rhymes with and becomes very annoying...and Rob Flynn sings like a bitch on. He sings clean a fair bit on this CD.  <br /> <br />I consider it a hangover from his Ross Robinson and Burning Red/Supercharger days and I'd prefer it if he just growled/snarled/whispered these sections, shut up or cut them out.  <br /> <br />Like I said, Machine Head in full flight few can match them, but they hit top gear so well and so often on this album and then lose momentum to mellow breakdowns and clean singing. <br /> <br />4 1/2 stars rounded to 5 due to Amazon's rating system.  <br /> <br />It is the metal album of the year.
B000MXPE74|5.0|What can you say that hasn't been said about this album already?  I am one of those people who stopped listening to U2 when they got huge and I can do without R.E.M. after they left IRS.<br /><br />Elitist?  Well, yeah.<br /><br />This band though, I hope they out-Oasis Oasis in terms of imports from across the pond.  It's criminal if more people DON'T hear this album beyond \\"Flathead\\" because it is one of the most listenable, impossible to get sick of releases I've heard in ages.  In the proud tradition of Orange Juice (the band, not the drink), The Skids (yes, I knew about them before the U2/Green Day \\"Pictures of Drowning People Sell Records\\" cover of \\"The Saints Are Coming\\" (a nod to Chumbawamba there if you caught it), Billy Connolly, Groundskeeper Willie and Trainspotting, here is another great thing to come out of Scotland.<br /><br />I'm glad I paid the $26 for a copy on import.  You don't have to though, so have at it already!<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />epsteinsmutha
B000GPIPT2|5.0|The Legacy Collection is the one to buy,if for no other reason than for less then a few bucks more, you get \\"The Bride\\".I keep seeing other reviewers saying the original is the best,and while i'll give it points for being first,\\"The Bride of Frankenstein\\"is by far the better film!<br /><br />  In fact,I'd go as far to say that\\"The Bride\\"is a bona fide american film classic,and defies genre.Probably one of the more literate,if eccentric,big budget movies of it's day, it is as much a sci-fi fantasy with satirical leanings, as it is a horror film.<br /><br />  A must see for fans of true classic hollywood films,it is James Whale's most fully realised project!
B000KCHZK6|4.0|Considering that this is Norah's first album in which she wrote or co-wrote all the tracks, it is surprisingly good.  My favorite tracks are Wake Me Up, Little Room, and Sinkin' Soon, although most of the other songs were good as well.  The only tracks that were subpar were Until the End, Not My Friend, and Rosie's Lullaby.  Overall, a very good album.  Would recommend to fans of Norah's and those wanting to see what the fuss is about. <br /> <br />
B000050IL0|5.0|We are fortunate to count three Goldberg's recorded by Gould. It is quite astonishing to watch this rendition compared to his earlier 1955 recording which most critics seem to call the \\"Gold\\" standard for this piece.  Seeing Gould perform this piece in this new way with a clear linkage between the variations is something not present in the earlier release where each variation seems to stand on its own. Another big plus is that there is very little humming compared to earlier Gould and thus much less distraction to this amazing performance. I would call your attention to something not much taught in concervatories these days -- finger substitution--watch Gould's technique. ALso, he apparently play the Goldberg's completely through without stop--something contrary to his \\"normal\\" practice of combining bits and pieces of different takes to produce what you hear on a CD. Stunning photography, exquisite performance and outstanding sound make this a must-have for any musician.  Observe the passion!
B000NA28IE|2.0|Wow, this was bad.<br /><br />I mean, staggeringly bad. I don't know whats worse - the blatant rip-offs of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Star Wars\\" or the very weak casting. And lets not even start on the dialogue.<br /><br />I think the main problem here is the casting. The young boy they selected to play the lead is not at all convincing or a very good actor in any sense of the word. Then there is the strange problem of character and place names. I swear, its as if the writer was so unimaginative that he actually fused together various names from LOTR and Star Wars to create new names for everything here. Pathetic.<br /><br />The dialogue is beyond bad. The language used in the book was pretty pedestrian (at least there was an excuse due to the young age of the author) but for a script to sound so sad is inexcusable. Here are a few gems (read and weep!):<br /><br />\\"What wisdom can I give people that they haven't already learned? What feats can I achieve that an army couldn't do better? It's insanity!\\" - by Eragon<br /><br />\\"My mind is the only sanctuary that has not been stolen from me. Men have tried to breach it before, but I've learned to defend it vigorously, for I am only safe with my innermost thoughts.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oaths betrayed, souls killed, eggs shattered! Blood everywhere. Murderers!\\"<br /><br />\\"You are an enigma, Eragon, a quandary that no one knows how to solve.\\"<br /><br />Add to that the numbing performances of all concerned. To be fair, the dragon special effects were very good, but this has been done better in countless other films.<br /><br />At the end of it, this film gives off a very \\"cheap\\" look. It looks like something that was produced for the Sci-Fi Channel but then someone had the sick idea to actually release this to mainstream theaters. Bad idea. No wonder this flopped (as it should have), as it has no redeeming features that I can think of.<br /><br />Not Recommended. You deserve better than to spend your money on this nonsense. And if you're thinking of watching this with your kids, you can do MUCH MUCH better elsewhere, with either \\"Gormenghast\\" or \\"Faerie Tale Theater\\".n this nonsense.

0618551050|4.0|This book makes a plausible argument that string theorists are following a fad that has little scientific promise. But much of the book leaves me with the impression that the disputes he's describing can only be fully understood by people who devote years to studying the math, and that the book has necessarily simplified things for laymen in ways that leave out many important insights.<br /><br />The argument I found most impressive was his claim that relativity shows that background independence is important enough that any theory which unites relativity with quantum mechanics will preserve relativity's background independence (a result which string theorists don't pursue). Still, this seems to be little more than an intuition, and until someone creates the revolutionary theory that unites relativity and quantum mechanics, there ought to be plenty of doubt about which approach is best.<br /><br />His sociological analysis of the problems with physics is less impressive. His endorsement of Feyeraband's belief that there's no such thing as a scientific method seems implausible (although it seems plausible for some stages of scientific thought, such as decisions about what questions to ask; maybe I ought to read Feyeraband's writings on this subject).<br /><br />I'm unimpressed by his lengthy gripes about the large fraction of funding that goes to routine science rather than revolutionary science. He implies this is making revolutionary science harder than it used to be, but I still see signs that a revolutionary scientist today would follow a path similar to Einstein's and encounter no greater obstacles.<br /><br />He wonders why those who fund scientific research don't fund some research the way the best venture capitalists do - taking risks of 90% of their choices failing in order to get a few really big successes. He seems to think risk aversion is the main reason. What I see missing from his analysis is the absence of large rewards to the funder who picks the next Einstein. I think that to get VC-like attitudes in funding agencies, we would need systems where part of the money and prestige of a Nobel prize went to a few people who made the key decisions to fund the prize-winning research. I expect it would be hard to alter existing institutions to replace committee-based funding decisions with the kind of individual authority needed for these incentives to work.<br /><br />His proposal to avoid having one unproven paradigm such as string theory dominate the funding in its area by limiting the funding to any one research program to one third of the total seems naive. The most direct effects of such a rule would be that researchers get around the rule by redefining the relevant categories (e.g. claiming that string theory research is diverse enough to qualify as several independent programs, or altering whatever category is used to define the total funding).<br /><br />He wants academics who have authority to influence hiring decisions to have the kind of training in avoiding prejudice and promoting diversity that their commercial equivalents get. I suspect he is way too optimistic about what that training accomplishes - my impression is that it's designed mostly to minimize the risk of lawsuits, and does more to hide biases than it does to prevent them.that to get VC-like attitudes in funding agencies, we would need systems where part of the money and prestige of a Nobel prize went to a few people who made the key decisions to fund the prize-winning research.

B000JLTRIG|5.0|CHAMRED: Season Seven=Seven Year Witch. Just kidding. That's just my way of introducing CHARMED: The Complete Seventh Season. This is season, just like the first six seasons, is jam packed with more intense storylines. But those intense storylines can't seem to get the best of THE CHARMED ONES. PIPER (again played by Holly Marie Combs), PHOEBE (again played by Alyssa Milano), & PAIGE (again played by Rose McGowan) are back for a seventh round of defeating demons, warlocks, and many more. <br /> <br />\\"A Call to Arms\\" <br />Reeling from the loss of their future son Chris, an overprotective Piper and Barbas-obsessed Leo are forced by Phoebe and Paige to attend a Hindu wedding, where they inadvertently receive the powers of the Hindu's Ultimate Lovers, Shakti, the Goddess of Creation and her lover, Shiva, the God of Destruction.  <br />  <br /> \\"The Bare Witch Project\\"  <br />Paige almost loses her fight to save Magic School when a bored student accidentally conjures Lady Godiva and Lord Dyson, a demonic land baron who feeds off humans' repressed emotions.  <br />  <br /> \\"Cheaper by the Coven\\" <br />Against Piper's wishes, Paige and Phoebe summon Grams for Chris's wiccaning. To put an end to the brother's sibling rivalry, Grams puts a spell on them, but in the process turns the sisters back to bickering teenagers.  <br />  <br /> \\"Charrrmed!\\"  <br />On a search to find witches who have been disappearing, Paige encounters Captain Black Jack Cutting, an infamous 18th century pirate who is searching for the Fountain of Youth to reverse a curse that causes him to age but never die.  <br />  <br /> \\"Styx Feet Under\\" <br />When a demon, Sirk, tries to destroy his human half by killing off his remaining blood relatives, Paige casts a spell that inadvertently blocks all death from occurring. Annoyed that he now has a back-log of work, the Angel of Death insists that the Charmed Ones help him clean up the mess and \\"kills\\" Piper so she can help him restore the Grand Design.<br />  <br /> \\"Once in a Blue Moon\\" <br />The Elders' suspicion of Leo causes them to assign a new Whitelighter to the girls. However, when the new Whitelighter is nearly killed by beasts, the Elders blame the attack on Leo. Trying to prove Leo's innocence, Piper, Phoebe and Paige discover that the beasts are actually the Charmed Ones' themselves, transformed by a blue moon.  <br />  <br /> \\"Someone to Witch Over Me\\" <br />Agent Brody convinces Paige to help him solve a mysterious string of accidents, only to discover that the demon Sarpedon is capturing innocents' Guardian angels and using them to protect himself from the forthcoming threat of a New Power.  <br />  <br /> \\"Charmed Noir\\" <br />While investigating a murder at Magic School, Paige and Agent Brody are sucked into an unfinished novel written twenty years ago by two students. They suddenly find themselves in a 1930s film noir, where they are chased by gangsters in pursuit of the famed Burmese Falcon.  <br />  <br /> \\"There's Something About Leo\\" <br />Leo reveals to Piper that he is an Avatar, despite the warnings from Alpha and Beta that Piper should find out in her own time. Phoebe and Paige call on Kyle for help, but his reaction to the news causes disastrous results.  <br />  <br /> \\"Witchness Protection\\" <br />The Avatars insist that Leo protect the Seer because she has information that can help them destroy the demons. The Seer shares with Phoebe a vision of a future in which there are no demons, leading the sisters to consider the possibility that the Avatars might be good and allowing Leo the opportunity to admit he is an Avatar.  <br />  <br /> \\"Ordinary Witches\\" <br />Still not completely sure that the Avatars mean well, Piper agrees to switch powers with Phoebe so that she too can see Phoebe's premonition of a Utopian world. During the spell, Zankou, the most powerful demon in the underworld, senses the girls' vulnerability and attacks them, accidentally transferring their powers to innocentbystanders, who run amok with their new abilities.  <br />  <br /> \\"Extreme Makeover: World Edition\\"  <br />While the Avatars prepare to transform the world into a Utopia, they inform the Charmed Ones that the human world must be put to sleep so that they can kill any remaining demons. Brody, doubting the Avatars good intentions, calls the Elders for help but is instead kidnapped by Zankou and agrees to help Zankou stop the change by placing a paranoia spell on Piper, Phoebe and Paige. During the Utopian transformation, Brody uses Paige's paranoia to attract and kill an Avatar. However, Brody pays a high price for his actions.  <br />  <br /> \\"Charmageddon\\" <br />While the Charmed Ones enjoy their new conflict-free world, Leo learns that in order for the Avatars to protect their Utopian world, they also control everyone's destiny by deciding who lives and dies. Wanting to stop the Avatars, Leo joins forces with Zankou to undo the change. Paige receives a special surprise and Leo's fate relies on the Elders.  <br />  <br /> \\"Carpe Demon\\"  <br />When Paige attempts to hire a new professor for Magic School, she learns that one of the candidates, Drake, is an ex-demon who made a deal with a demonic Sorcerer to become human.  <br />  <br /> \\"Show Ghouls\\"  <br />When Darryl fears his friend Mike is possessed, Phoebe, Paige and Drake discover that Mike had been working close to a site where a cabaret was destroyed in a fire in 1899, killing hundreds of people. The spirit of one of the victims is using Mike to plead for help on behalf of all the Lost Souls who are trapped in the cabaret, forced to relive that night for eternity.  <br />  <br /> \\"The Seven Year Witch\\"  <br />Already stressed out awaiting word on Leo's fate, Piper is attacked by demons and ends up in a coma. Stuck in the cosmic void between life and death, Piper's spirit is surprised to find Cole waiting for her and even more surprised when he tells her that he is there to help keep her and Leo together, which he hopes will restore Phoebe's faith in love.  <br />  <br /> \\"Scry Hard \\"  <br />Zankou sends his underlings to attack Leo in hopes of luring the sisters out of their house so that he can search for the Nexus and release the Shadow, the ultimate power. Terrified after witnessing demons attack his parents, Wyatt magically shrinks Piper and Leo and traps them inside a dollhouse for their protection.  <br />  <br /> \\"Little Box of Horrors\\"  <br />The Charmed Ones are in a race against time when the mythological Pandora's Box falls into the hands of Katya, a shapeshifting demon who intends to open the box and fill the world with all of its sorrows. Phoebe and Piper try to find Hope, the Guardian who can return any released evil spirits to the box.  <br />  <br /> \\"Freaky Phoebe\\" <br />After a spell is cast on Phoebe by the power-hungry sorceress Imara, their souls switch bodies and Phoebe ends up becoming trapped in a cage.  <br />  <br /> \\"Imaginary Fiends\\" <br />Unbeknownst to the Charmed Ones, baby Wyatt's new \\"imaginary\\" friend is actually the demon Vicus, who is trying to win Wyatt's trust to turn him evil. Piper casts a spell to be able to understand baby Wyatt, but inadvertently brings 25-year-old Wyatt back from the future.  <br />  <br /> \\"Death Becomes Them\\" <br />Zankou's plan to make the sisters vulnerable so that he can take control of the Book of Shadows starts to work when Phoebe is left guilt-ridden after a classmate is brutally killed in front of her and comes back from the dead to blame her. Also part of Zankou's plan, Paige is devastated when she finds her new charge dead and realizes she was powerless to save her.  <br />  <br /> \\"Something Wicca This Way Goes\\" <br />With the Book of Shadows finally in his possession, Zankou plans to open the Spiritual Nexus and take in the power of the Shadow. To divert Zankou's attention away from the Nexus, Piper, Phoebe and Paige successfully goad him into coming after them instead. The sisters come to the realization that the only way to stop Zankou may be to sacrifice themselves.  <br /> <br />    What a great season. Very bewitching. This seventh season should definitely be in your CHARMED collection.
1577314808|4.0|As you would notice if you follow the more than thousand reviews of this book, there is no shortage of admirers and a few detractors with whom I also agree. There is no book in this planet whose words provide an infallible recipe for happiness or in which you might not find contradictory statements. As much as I agree with Mr. Eckhart that in many occasions labels of right and wrong for the situations of your life are originated by a severe lack of insight, I still fail to see how a person can operate in life without a sense of identity or \\"ego\\". I guess the book would be more convincing with less biblical references (after all that book is responsible for a lot of unhappiness in this world) and a more direct recognition that as long as we exist trouble will be a companion which his teachings can only ease but never eliminate.
B000002UTY|2.0|It seems that a lot of the folks reviewing this CD still spend a lot of time with with their bongs. Yes, it's a pretty good record. But a little of the Bo Diddley beat goes a long way, and 30 plus minutes of it overstays its welcome. And for my money, Gary Duncan cuts John Cipollina to shreds; John's OVERUSE of the whammy bar takes a lot away from his playing. The cd's \\"Quicksilver\\" and \\"Comin' Thru\\" are much better than this one. I recommend this for completists only......
055357342X|3.0|Pretty good story, but I would have preferred for the book to have been about 300 pages shorter (too many side stories that go no where, and take a long time getting there).  After reading the first three books in the series, I will be taking a break until the rest of the series comes out.  I have two reasons for this....to see if they get better reviews (or more of the same), and I need a break....the books were just too long and to much work.  I may be ready to continue again when the series is scheduled to be finished (2011). <br /> <br />For those interested, I think after book 3 is a good place for getting off the merry-go-round for a while.  Enough of the story is wrapped up, or at least settling a little.
0790729350|5.0|It's great to see this concert film again. The split-screen effect still holds up, even if it's a bit distracting to the enjoyment of the musical performances. Richie Havens and The Who still stand out as incredible sequences in the film. I'm not such a fan of mud, but these people actually make mud dancing look like fun. There's an incredible story about why the Woodstock festival actually took place in Bethel. A guy named Elliot Tiber issued a concert permit to the Woodstock organizers from the Bethel Chamber of Commerce, where he was a member. The rest, as they say, is history. The Elliot Tiber story is told very well in a forthcoming book called TAKING WOODSTOCK. Keep an eye out for it on Amazon; it should fast become the perfect preamble to watching this movie. Have fun, everyone, and remember -- DON'T EAT THE BROWN ACID!!

B000002J1S|5.0|From the first note played until the last is struck, this album is pure genius. It is, by far, the best Genesis album. I feel Genesis was building toward this masterpiece with their previous works 'Selling England by the Pound', 'Foxtrot', 'Nursery Cryme'and 'Trespass'. The album has beautiful continuity and it is hard to listen to one song individually. Once you start this work of art, it's almost impossible not to listen through till the end. One of my all-time favorites. I think Gabriel left at the right time, as this would have been very difficult to duplicate or exceed this brilliance.
B000LE0TGA|3.0|OUT OF THE BLUE is not my favorite ELO album. It is in fact, TIME. Some of you are probaby shocked by that but hey, I like ELO a lot and I chose to have an odd choice of a favorite. This brings me to this album. Normally it should be a 4-5 star album. But I have to agree with the others about the remastering.<br /><br />I have a very high end stereo, everything goes Digital cables  or Digital Ballanced cables. I usually notice the smallest things. For instance the new Boston remasters, Fantastic. This remaster sounds boomy, Dull and Flat. However, the original released (Remastered by Joe Gastwirt) sound top notch compared to this.<br /><br />I don't know if Jeff Lynnes ears are gone, or if he wasn't that involved. Or perhaps this is a mistake and we got an age old tape duplicate. After all, the other ELO remasters are wonderful.<br /><br />FInal opinion....Buy it for the restored artwork and the two bonus tracks. It isn't a high priced remaster (other bands up the price to $18.99 to re-release this kind of stuff).
B000001DQG|3.0|Despite having one the best songs Elton John and Bernie Taupin have ever penned together in \\"Ticking\\", I find the rest the album lacking compared to anything they had done in the the past. It also falls far short of their following release 'Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy'. I am not particularly fond of the two singles \\"The [...] is Back\\" or \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\" although I feel the latter is much easier on the ear than the former. That being said, it is early Elton John, and I feel you could find worse albums than this to add to your collection. It is worth buying for \\"Ticking \\" alone. It is seven minutes and 36 seconds of genius.
B00005M91K|5.0|24 countries, thirteen years of shooting, made to emerge one of my most beloved cult movies of the nineties.

0812976525|5.0|this book is an incredibly good, slap in your face kind of book. the humor is so on and sophisticated that one would have to be insane not to like this book. the first thing i am going to say is that the the book ends way differently from the movie. if you have the time to read the book first, please do so. the story carried very well and i never really lost interest (like i do with most other books). the book really does hit the nail on the head with the portayal of special interest groups and how their hands are almost always in politics. the story was very well thought out and the plot was incredibly enjoyable. a very good book indeed.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|This is a very good movie - about gun violence.  It's really not about 'human interconnectivity', as it's been positioned or reviewed by others.  In a sense, the gun connects, but it's misleading to say this movie is about interconnecting human lives.  This is a movie about a gun and the hell that it wrought.  Human beings were merely a conduit.
B000KX0IOK|4.0|Half Nelson is the story about the unlikely friendship between a drug-addicted teacher and a misguided student. Ryan Gosling plays Dan Dunn, a history teacher and basketball coach who attempts to think outside the box when teaching his students about the civil rights movement. Unfortunately, most of the time his lectures come across as mindless rambling, and I personally wondered what he could possibly put on a test that would make any sense with his lectures about opposites and dialectics. Dan lives a pretty solitary life, alone with his cat and his addiction. When one of his students, Drey, catches him smoking crack in the bathroom, they strike up a friendship based on their joint secret. Drey tries to watch out for Dan, while he does the same for her, even going as far as telling his drug dealer, and her incarcerated brother's friend, to stay away from her because she's a good kid. Hypocrisy is ripe with this film.<br /><br />Half Nelson isn't the sort of movie that you need to watch if you're in the mood for something light and upbeat. It's depressing at worst, and enlightening at best. The friendship that blooms between Dan and Drey is at the heart of the film, and its development is what makes the film worth watching. But it's hard to tell what we're supposed to take away from this film. Her teacher is a crackhead, but as long as she stays with him he won't use around her--is that any reason for a teenage girl to have to take care of a grown man who is supposed to be leading by example. His student has potential and, though he's too far gone to save himself, he can maybe just save her. Does that excuse the inherent hypocrisy in asking your own drug dealer to stay away from someone he's known longer and more closely? It's hard to know where to put this film. It's hard to know what the message is supposed to be. The film's plot took forever to get going and then it ended abruptly and with little explanation, but I liked it anyway. I don't think Half Nelson is the sort of movie that everyone will enjoy, but if you're willing to accept the fact that questions are left unanswered and you're the sort of person who can draw your own conclusions without having a message drawn out for you, I think you'll enjoy it.the sort of movie that everyone will enjoy, but if you're willing to accept the fact that questions are left unanswered and you're the sort of person who can draw your own conclusions without having a message drawn out for you, I think you'll enjoy it.

After purchasing the collector's edition, I sat through the day by day film auto-biography that was 3 1/2 hours long and very good. it was amazing to see all the hard work that was put into the making of the film. it also has a segment of interviews after the movie was shot and a short documentary about taking the film to cannes. on top of all the other extras i didnt mention, it also includes an actual cell from the american subtitled version of the movie and the manga. i would highly recommend this to anyone i know even if they have never seen the film.

B000002TQV|3.0|First of all, I'd like to start my review on this album by saying that I am not a Radiohead fan. For this reason, I am really sure that I will be completely objective. <br /> <br />This band is without any doubt one of the most important in the last 15 years, it is a strange case in rock music, because they dare to explore new directions without having  <br />fear to fail or to succeed. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, not all of their albums are masterpieces.  <br /> <br />The bends is really a good album, but is just the beginning of an evolution. The most important thing is that Thom York found his vocalization's style in songs such as Fake Plastic Trees and High and Dry.  <br />The rest of the songs, including My Iron Lung, are good efforts, but nothing extraordinary. You can notice that their composition and guitar riffs are just average, nothing new or unheard,  even closer to Nirvana's sound.  <br />Radiohead's fans really love it, and that's because many of them were born with this album. Here is where the real story of Radiohead began, and the love these people have for this album is immense, and I understand them. <br />Is something similar for fans of Depeche Mode who love Black Celebration. This is not Depeche's best album, but their dark and romantic sound was born there. The same time many of their fans were born. <br /> <br />I personally think this is just a good album, whenever I listen to High and Dry, I remember the year 1995, and feel kind of nostalgia. But I prefer \\"OK Computer\\"; I think there is where Radiohead reached their perfection musically and literally. <br /> <br />
0743289684|3.0|I thought there would be more uncomfortable revealings about islam, which Ali discovered, but did not go into detail. Her life story got me all confused with too many names and characters. Nevertheless her fight should be every muslim woman's fight, otherwise we can all expect the shroud to cover us all.
0060575816|4.0|Quite good. I enjoyed this about as much as Phillip Pullman's [[ASIN:0345448898 His Dark Materials Trilogy: The Golden Compass / The Subtle Knife / The Amber Spyglass]]. I think Pullman's work juggles weightier philosophical issues, but Nix's may be a bit more fun, faster. Nix uses cliffhanger endings to chapters frequently, and to good effect.<br /><br />Sabriel is a strong main character. It's refreshing to see her struggle with the weight of responsibility thrown upon her. Like characters from Ursula LeGuin's [[ASIN:0553262505 A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)]], she doesn't always make the right decisions and isn't always confident in her abilities. Because of that she feels much more genuine than a fearless hero type. But, worry not, she still takes care of business with sword and bells ringing.<br /><br />Also, the world (or worlds) that Nix has created are unique and intriguing. I like it that he drops you right into it, without spending too many words explaining the difference between Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom, or the difference between the Charter and Free Magic, or giving a history of necromancy or anything. He doesn't explain, he just lets the story unfold and you come to understand the rules of his world by travelling through it with Sabriel. Quite effective, enough so that I've just picked up Lirael and look forward to continuing the series.
1582701709|4.0|I see positive and negative aspects to this book. I buy into the energy concept that causes us to reflect the feelings of those around us unless we become aware of what we are doing. I also think that we repeat patterns in relationships because we communicate with an energy of what we believe about ourselves, resulting in others fulfilling our self-beliefs. Listening to the book caused me to take a fresh look at some of the negative self-messages I carry, and I found that helpful.    I don't believe that abundance is about money necessarily. As others have mentioned, that leads to narcissism as a focus and can create negative energy. Perhaps you can create material wealth by focusing on it; many have--but is that the valuable use of this power? I believe that abundance is about having everything you need to fulfill your destiny--your purpose on earth. I think that is the underpinning of the spiritual concept. For some, that purpose may involve wealth, especially if an aspect of their destiny is to give. For others like Mother Theresa, that purpose involves a vow of poverty. If a person is consumed by debt and other financial challenges that are detracting from his or her destiny, then rethinking negative thoughts toward finances is critical. I found the comments useful for that reason. (BTW, Jesus was a millionaire? Huh?)    I also agree with reviewers who said that the fat comment was inappropriate. I suffer from chronic pain throughout my body as a result of a car accident, and I had a friend reject me after taking THE COURSE IN MIRACLES. It was devastating. My low energy apparently did not bring her joy. I isolated myself for some time, assuming that I was harming others by exposing them to my pain. I finally realized that some life is better than no life, and picked myself up off the couch.     I do not believe that negative thinking caused my car accident or the resulting pain. (Some guy whose windshield was not defrosted pulled out from a gas station into traffic, realized a car was coming, stuck his monster-of-a-car into reverse and slammed into my little Chevette.)     What I realize is that I can rot in despair or believe that, at least for now, this frustrating situation is developing an understanding, wisdom, and compassion in me that is part of my destiny, which is my abundance in the midst of suffering. I function much better when I can achieve an attitude of appreciation for a greater good rather than bitterness and despair.     Although I disagree with the guilt-inducing concept of negativity causing disaster and disease, the book reminded me to keep a positive focus, despite my circumstances. (BTW, how many of the people used as examples experienced periods of adversity? Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King were both assassinated. The reality is that death comes for all humans, no matter how much they believe in abundance and manifestation. That means at some point, at least one body part has to fail. Furthermore, should we avoid those with pain and suffering because of their low energy? What if Mother Teresa had decided to stay away from the poor and infirmed because they brought down her energy level? She gave from her abundance, and she was replenished with the power of a waterfall. Everyone who has given to those in need understands the beauty of this concept.)    Overall, I enjoyed this book on audio--liked the various voices and sound effects. The message is generally valuable and touching. I hope that people keep a balanced perspective as they read or listen. My field is special education, and I especially hope that is true for parents of a child with a disability. You did not cause that to happen. When Jesus was asked who had sinned to cause a person's disability, he replied that it was for the glory of God. Your child has a purpose in this life.

B000MGUZMU|1.0|Since I posted my review of Arcade Fire's recent aural lobotomy, I've had a number of comments from all kinds of thoughtful and concerned Amazon readers. I would like to say how grateful I am for all of your amusing and ultimately sycophantic comments. It seems I struck a nerve with some whose intellect I obviously insulted. I'm so very sorry that I hurt your little indie feelings and wish to extend this: THIS ALBUM SUCKS A__! Not only is boring upon first listen, it actually gets worse the more I hear it. If there is anything good on this album, they must have left it in the studio. Thanks very much, but I'll stick with Metric, The Dears, The Stars, Tokyo Police Club, etc. when it comes to Canadian content. And for real subtlety and lyrical expression, I'll take The Good, The Bad & The Queen. I wonder if Arcade Fire has heard that one? Could learn a few things!<br /><br />Bring on the comments!!!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig reinvents the James Bond character in this film and the results are shockingly good. I didn't expect much given that Casino Royale (the source material) isn't a very good story to begin with. But they made the most of it. <br /> <br />Craig is the first actor to play the role who actually has the physical presence to credibly pull it off. While others looked at home at parties but looked silly once the action started, Craig can do both. He also has the emotional detachment necessary to play the character in a convincing way.  <br /> <br />I would rather have seen Judi Dench not be in the film (a clean break) because she comes off as an abrasive mother rather than a tough boss. But thankfully John Cleese is gone this time as well as the old introduction of the gadgets to be used later scene which in my opinion never worked onscreen. The Felix Lighter (CIA) character was unnecessary and didn't really work. But he wasn't around much thankfully. <br /> <br />In terms of plot, the flim pulls off a gradual build better than most bond films. We see bond tearing down a plot (and a man) one step at a time hopping all over the globe as he does it. He work his way logically through the case from beginning to end. Every location used as a backdrop is exotic but doesn't remain on screen so long that it gets boring. <br /> <br />I expected the card game to be boring. But they found a way to make it work by putting breaks in that allowed for \\"the game\\" to progress in other ways.  <br /> <br />This was an amazing film in any number of ways. It took a character on its last legs and somehow reinvented it by going back to basics. It also took the action movie format itself and made it seem interesting for the first time in many years. Daniel Craig shows how to play a tough guy and others would do well to watch. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I was so thrilled when I heard that there was going to be a new version of Jane Eyre. It is one of the best stories ever written! This version of the story was well put together, even with it's added lines and different turns from the original story. I felt that it kept with the true spirit of Jane's life. It left out quite a lot from when Jane was in school but it still came accross as being a very difficult time for her in her youth. Rochester was stern, clever, spirited, well learned, and you could feel his emotions, whether verbal or from his facial/body expressions. The actors were well put together and you could feel/see their feelings growing towards each other. This adaptation of Jane Eyre makes you want to watch it over and over again!!!
B000M4RG42|5.0|I used to think Flags of Our Fathers is just another historical war movie. I bought it just to fulfill my curiosity of the photo of the Flag. But I was totally wrong... It \\"rewritten\\" the history by focusing the point of views of the flag-raisers, the heros who fought in the war in the island of Iwo Jima. It got really interesting (for me) when the flag was raised the second time... hum, you got to see it for yourselves.
B00007K02F|4.0|This was a great adaptation to the classic tale of Jane Eyre. The actors were brilliantly well put together and you could feel their emotions towards each other and towards those around them. Rochester isn't quite as mean/hard as you feel he is in the book, but his other qualities make up for that. Jane Eyre's character was quaint, quite, well composed, and pulled it off really well. One of the best Jane Eyre's to hit the screen.

B000KRNCYY|5.0|Once Again the Celtic Woman explode on the stage with their talant. This time adding the new and exciting voice of  Hayley Westenra, who at her young age can hold her own and then some along with the other talents on the stage.  There is no denying the fact that this group enjoys what they are doing and come well packed with a diverse list of songs and music to surly excite listeners of every age. <br />
0140185232|5.0|This is truly a classic novel containing much more that the movie 1946 movie left out...if you have seen that movie, then you owe it to yourself to read the book.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|The chase scene right at the beginning was enough to tell me this movie was not up the being a good Bond movie.  Die Another Day was pretty bad, but this...  Okay, I could accept Daniel Craig as James Bond.  He was not the problem here.  The problem was that this looked more like a 1970's Chuck Norris movie than a James Bond movie. (I loved Chuck Norris and his movies by the way).  This movie was about money.  No supervillains...Just money.  And can anyone really believe that the British government in a effort to thwart the bad guys would come up with a plan like this one?  Lets stake our best poker player to a few million and hope he wins.  No. Also, as I recall in earlier Bond films, (Goldfinger, I think) 007 was given him his Aston-Martin by Q.  He hadn't won it in a poker game.  Bond and action go together, but the climbing up the cranes and the jumping from crane to crane was way over the top.  Also, when Bond swerves his car to avoid hitting the girl in the road...Maybe the most ridiculous looking bit of fakery in recent big budget movie history. I did kind of like the collapsing building in Venice though I must admit. I gave this 2 stars only because it was James Bond and the closing theme was worth replaying.  James Bond needs to be more sauve...That's the appeal of the franchise.  Where was the wit?  Oh, I'm sorry, the line about that last hand almost killing me was it. I am willing to give Daniel Craig another chance.  Let's just hope they come up with a better script.  If they don't...Hey, Forced Vengeance with Chuck Norris is all the action I need...And he wears the suits well too.

0205313426|5.0|Strunks Elements of Style is the English gospel.  It is small enough that you can carry it everywhere you go.  A must for anyone serious about writing.
B000AGTPUU|4.0|My Grandkids, ages 8 and 4, really liked this movie.  The animation is fantastic.  The four year old loves anything to do with trains.  Some things seemed a little scary but they both handled it well.  Overall, it is a very good Christmas movie.
B000LPQ6DE|3.0|I thought it very wonderful that Masterpiece did a production following the story line so closely ie. Jane Eyre's teaching and her cousins love interest.But,I was so dissapointed at the addition of very sensual love scenes as well as a weegee board \\"game\\" at Thornfield.That was way out of line from the authors intent.She was a clergymans daughter.I would warn any conservatives from watching this.Guess I should have read the write up more closely,thought they were just bluffing.=)Great acting,I like Ruth's freshness,she seemed to really be Jane.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|I bought this cd for the song 'Be Here Now' I was very impressed by the different styles of music I heard in it
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Entertaining, suspenseful space opera with a great cast of characters.  After you have enjoyed the series be sure to watch the movie which completes it--\\"Serenity\\"
B000N4SHPS|5.0|The sixth installment of the Rocky series brought many questions to the floor when it was first announced.  \\"Why are they doing this?\\", \\"Are they really going to have Rocky fight again?\\", and \\"What are they thinking?\\" were the reactions I heard and in some cases gave.  I didn't see why it was necessary to make another movie...  That was until I saw this film.<br /><br />This movie truly gave closure to the series and was beautifully put together.  I'm never one for spoilers, so you'll have to watch the movie, but I'm telling you, as a huge Rocky fan, this movie is worth it.  All the \\"Why's\\", the \\"What for's\\", and the \\"This isn't necessary's\\" are put to rest as the movie comes to a close.  It is a beautiful way to end it and I'm so glad they made this movie.<br /><br />I was skeptical at first, but all of my concerns were put to rest by the film.  If you've enjoyed the Rocky films and haven't seen this, it is a must, for it completes the story of the greatest underdog in the history of film.  And it does it in a very magical way.
B0000074NU|2.0|This is nowhere near the \\"Best of\\" as there are too many classic UFO songs missing. This is merely a selection of a few greats and an overview of the Paul Chapman era when to be honest none of the songs featured would ever make a true best of selection. Check out \\"Essential\\" for a more realistic best of collection for the period. Better still buy the Live \\"Strangers in the Night\\" album, which is excellent value and has all you need to start to appreciate a great band.
0060090383|5.0|This installment is probably the \\"deepest\\" of the four books about the Walsh sisters. In a nutshell, Rachel goes to rehab. The catch is that she doesn't believe she has a problem, and Keyes portrays that line of thinking very well. Many of Rachel's friends in rehab are also portrayed in ways that make the reader think about addiction. She is witty and serious at the same time. Rachel grows a lot in this book, and Keyes still has her signature funny moments. Though this book is on the serious side, the Walsh family is still there to crack us up.
1582701709|5.0|Halfway through, I'm already changing the way I think about each choice, daily. Whether or not it proves valid for me by manifesting what I model and think and is in my consciousness, it makes one aware of how we shape our lives, each choice at a time. That in itself is worth the book's price. Now, if it proves itself out further, then it will have changed everything about the way I go about my daily business and the thoughts I feed my body and soul with. For some, this will only be another how-to book telling them something they haven't fully comprehended. You get what you put into and what you need out of this book.
B000MGUZKM|5.0|The amazing thing about this album is how little Randy Crawford's voice has changed over 30 years.  Soft, with that trademark little trill, or strong and occasionally steely, she still has a unique timbre and style and her enunciation is still crystal clear. There is no risk, as with some singers in middle age, that you will discover to your horror that the whole voice and range have changed.  <br />The arrangements are sparse and all kudos to Joe Sample for that. <br />My only quibble is the two tracks here that are slightly updated repeats from the Now We May Begin album of 25+ years ago - Rio de Janiero Blue and Last Night at Danceland. They are OK tunes, but the lyrics are not the best and I am not sure these go well with the others on this otherwise fine album.
B00008PW2D|5.0|DVD is brand new... it was just what i expected. Love those sex and the city girls!
B000660UN0|4.0|Interpritation... isn't that what Music is? Same with Opinions.<br /><br />This Collection is full and ambient. Things do change with time, as EC has. Peter Green's Mr.J was precise, yet raw. John Hammond's was enlightening, yet masked. Clapton's touch is that of a mortal playing a Legends work.
B00003CXB4|5.0|An amazing product! A classic movie (in my opinion, anyway) and I'm glad to have it in my collection.
0374105235|5.0|I loved this book.  This is the most eye-opening book I've ever read.  It is horrifying and terrible, and really touching too.  It's a true story but sometimes it is really hard to believe that such atrocities are still happening all over the world.  Ishmael is a brave soul.
1400032717|4.0|I totally enjoyed this book.  I have worked with autistic children for about 6 years now and could so see some of the kids that I worked with in this book.  Mr. Haddon grasp the mind of someone with autism probably as good as anyone without it could.  A delightful read that had tender moments and sheds much light on the fact that everyone's mind does not perceive things the same way.
B00006EXL5|4.0|Now, I know I can't spell but that dosn't mean I'm not smart. I know I am at least smart enough to tell that this album is unique enough and good enough to recieve a 4 out of 5. And that is only because I believe it's immposible to be perfect in anything.  <br />It's not an album that jumps at you when you first hear it. IN fact you might not like it at first, but if listend to carefully along with reading the lyrics ,one will fins this album mind blowing especially if a big fan of MCR's other stuff.
B000I2J79K|1.0|I saw this DVD at a friend's house and I just had to have it - it's AWESOME and it deserves 5 stars. The reason for the one star is that when I received the DVD the cover said that it only plays on HD DVD players. Since I just spent close to $3000 on a HD 50 inch plasma TV and a home theater system to go with it, I did not think it was a problem. Well, I was WRONG. This HD DVD does NOT play on my DVD player - it is not compatible. I did not realize that I was getting the HD DVD version of this DVD. I want to order one that plays on my DVD player but I am hesitant - how will I know I will be getting the one that plays on the DVD player that I have? I cannot return it since it's been opened so now I am stuck with a $20.00 DVD that I cannot play. I am very, very disappointed.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|I liked the movie, I feel that they kept a lot of the Bond of yesterday and made Daniel Craig more realistic than Pierce Brosnan, who in my personal opinion was a bad choice for Bond.  Casino Royale seems to emphasize more on characters and story than gadgetry, which was always what made Bond films fun.  Overall I really enjoyed the film.<br /><br />Complaint:  I now see I am not the only one experiencing this.  Buyers beware of the 2 disc Special Edition DVD of Casino Royale.  There appears to be an almost yellowish haze on the film, and it matters not which disc you have playing.  After getting another copy back from Amazon, it also had the haze.  I enjoyed the show but unfortunately this haze is annoying to me.  If anyone has any ideas, or you happen to have one that does not have the haze, please let me know what I can do to get a copy that is not like the two I have so far tried from Amazon.  Thank you-<br /><br />George
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I bought this DVD because of a recommendation from a friend.  What a great movie.  It is hard to classify.  I really enjoyed the twists.  I'm glad I bought the movie because I watched it again the next weekend.
B00003CXC6|5.0|This is, without a doubt, an amazing acomplishment in post-war Japanese cinema, as well as my personal favorite Kurosawa film (though Yojimbo comes in close second). From start to finish; simple, understated, austere, and yet it works so well under the circumstances. Kurosawa seamlessly blends a unique multi-angle form of storytelling with a simple elemental setting, and his own minimalist direction to create a truly fascinating vision. The use of pounding rain, sweltering heat, a cool breeze, the shade of a tree, all serve so well to convey the atmosphere of each of the respective scenes. Still, equal praise must be lavished upon the actors themselves. Takashi Shimura brings a wonderful humility and honesty to his role as the woodcutter, and serves to tie the various accounts together. Toshiro Mifune, in one of his earlier performances, creates a striking mix of ferocity and malaise, evoking a predatory lion, toying with his prey. Truly, a masterpiece from start to finish, and one of the greatest films to even come out of the land of the rising sun. Watch it as soon as humanly possible. You shall not be disapointed.
B000002G26|4.0|I'm sure that the '05 release, \\"Anthology,\\" covers more of his career, but for folks like myself who enjoyed Bryan Adams' career in the 80's and early 90's, \\"So Far, So Good\\" is probably the best compilation out there.  Adams takes a lot of heat for his music and, frankly, I don't understand why.  He's a very talented musician as his multiple hit songs can attest to, so I see very little room for major criticism.  If you don't like him, don't listen to him.<br /><br />I like him and have to say that this disc is one of my favorites when I want to remember the good ol' days.  The disc starts off with \\"Summer of '69\\" and then rolls right into \\"Straight From The Heart.\\"  From there we are treated to a nice helping of Adams' best rockers and ballads.  Personal favorites include \\"Cuts Like A Knife,\\" \\"Run To You,\\" \\"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\\" and \\"Heaven.  It also has \\"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You,\\" which many consider the beginning of the end for Adams.  He went on to release a few other soundtrack tunes and moderately popular hits like \\"The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me (Is You)\\" after the release of this hits compilation and they are included on the later \\"Best Of Me.\\"  Hardcore fans may want to pick up that title or the aforemetioned \\"Anthology.\\"<br /><br />For those of us who only want the bulk of Adams' biggest tunes, stick with \\"So Far, So Good.\\"  It won't let you down.
B00004STPT|5.0|I am a proud owner of this album,which now joins my cherished CD collection.It is an album put together perfectly by two very good artists.The music is superbly performed,which makes most of the tracks very intense,due to the scenes in the film.A very good choice if you like powerful orchestral music with a touching vocalist(Lisa Gerrard).
B000002TLX|5.0|But the guy knew how to write and perform a hit song.  He was very good at doing that and this \\"Greatest Hits\\" album serves up all of his biggest songs.  Much like Bryan Adams, Marx took a lot of heat for being \\"uncool\\" but somehow managed to make quite a few pennies off of the listening audience.  I'm proud to say that not only do I own this particular album but I also bought \\"Repeat Offender\\" when it came out.<br /><br />For those of you who want to skip over all of the albums and get straight to the good stuff, \\"Greatest Hits\\" is a perfect purchase.  It includes solid rockers like \\"Don't Mean Nothing\\" and \\"Satisfied,\\" but Marx really shines on his ballads.  My personal favorites include \\"Angelia\\" and the ballad to beat all ballads, \\"Right Here Waiting.\\"  Other big tunes on here include \\"Endless Summer Nights,\\" \\"Hazard,\\" \\"Hold On To The Nights,\\" and the soul-tinged \\"The Way She Loves Me.\\"  Also included here is the powerful \\"Children of the Night.\\"<br /><br />If you enjoy light rock and strong ballads, Richard Marx' \\"Greatest Hits\\" is the album for you.  It's a wonderful album to put on when you're trying to get your ladyfriend in the mood, or if you just need to relax a little.
B000MGUZMU|1.0|I have written this on the other Neon Bible selection, and thought I'd paste it here so everyone has access to it. If you liked the uniqueness and energy present and welcome in their first CD \\"Funeral\\", then you are in for a surprise. This has to be the most boring, repetitive, mirthless, disappointing piece of garbage I have ever heard. While some tracks sound like they are being performed from the bottom of a well (or maybe from a hole directly connected to the underworld, I am not sure), other tracks sound like the instruments are being played by trained performing monkeys, who only know three chords. The subject matter is never funny, never fun, never smart; it is dull and depressing and basically trying too hard to be different, from the very beginning up to the very end. Reselling on Ebay? You betcha.
B000000XB9|5.0|Although purists may say that key tunes were left off of this helping of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \\"Chronicle, Vol. 1,\\" most casual fans will be well pleased with purchasing this album.  It includes the bulk of the major hits for CCR.  Their gritty, country-fried blues-rock is deep-seated into American culture.  Their songs sound as fresh and intense today as they did when these tunes were initially released.<br /><br />This is backwoods, bayou music best appreciated by fans of Southern rock and blues.  John Fogerty and company sound great on songs like the voodoo-tinged \\"I Put A Spell On You\\" and the straight-ahead rocker \\"Fortunate Son.\\"  Casual fans will easily pick up most of these songs, especially \\"Proud Mary,\\" \\"Have You Ever Seen The Rain,\\" and \\"Up Around The Bend.\\"  My personal favorite, \\"Bad Moon Rising,\\" is also on this disc.<br /><br />For folks who are only familiar with a few of their songs, \\"Chronicle, Vol:  1\\" is a great starting point for further exploration.  Hardcore fans may miss songs like \\"Born on the Bayou,\\" but that one, along with many others, can be found on the second \\"Chronicle\\" volume.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent disc for both new listeners and longtime fans.  I highly recommend it.
074356619X|1.0|After having heard some glowing reviews by acquaintances, I bought the CD version of The Secret.  It was incredibly disappointing.  The author comes across as a late night infomercial saleswoman, repeating and repeating her message with no development.  There are vestiges of real spiritual knowledge here, but her 'teachers' are third rate, in general. The most important spiritual messages are being are ignored in favor of enticing people with the idea of money as an end in itself.  People, there is much better spiritual guidance out there!  Do not jump on this bandwagon!  Written with love.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I just finished watching the new James Bond Movie Casino Royale and I can say it was one of the best James Bond movies to come out in years. After watching the horrible Die Another Day I was a little afraid to watch Casino Royale. I took a risk and I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed this movie. This latest movie brings much needed life in to the James Bond Franchise which over the past few years had lost its edge. This is a new and improved Bond played by Daniel Craig. Daniel gives a great performance as 007, and his character actually has emotions and is not portrayed as this one dimensional robot like the previous films. The action scenes in this movie are great, and to see James Bond fall in love just adds to the drama of this movie. I don't want to give the movie away so I will say no more. This movie has some slow moments in it, but for the most part it is a good, entertaining, action packed movie.

B000MRA5NS|5.0|I just finished watching the new James Bond Movie Casino Royale and I can say it was one of the best James Bond movies to come out in years. After watching the horrible Die Another Day I was a little afraid to watch Casino Royale. I took a risk and I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed this movie. This latest movie brings much needed life in to the James Bond Franchise which over the past few years had lost its edge. This is a new and improved Bond played by Daniel Craig. Daniel gives a great performance as 007, and his character actually has emotions and is not portrayed as this one dimensional robot like the previous films. The action scenes in this movie are great, and to see James Bond fall in love just adds to the drama of this movie.  I don't want to give the movie away so I will say no more. This movie has some slow moments in it, but for the most part it is a good, entertaining, action packed movie. The Blu-ray disc picture looks amazing in true 1080p HD, and the sound is top notch as well if you choose the linear PCM 5.1 soundtrack. This is another one of the best looking Blu-ray discs (along with Crank, The Departed, and Babel) to come out.

B000001EYO|3.0|The song that goes with the Treehorn dream sequence in the film (Kenny Rodgers et al \\"Tripped on a Cloud/ 8-miles high\\") was better in the movie, as the version on the cd is a poor original edit, with ackward reverses (and I like reverses, when not halfway through a measure...- for example, the reverse that opens it up is fine, the one three quarters through or so, you see, is not.), half measures chopping up the rhythm and in general either hastily done or naively...  I've toyed with the idea of re-editing it myself in a track editor, but I'll just delete it from my player, because I'm lazy.  The other tracks are good, but with a few odd ones like the feminist chant song- play this at your next Halloween party/[...].  I have loads of creedence, so not missing that.  the Gypsy Kings' \\"Hotel California\\" is the best track, much better after first listen as anyone who has watched Lebowski more than a few times will be surprised by the new verses at first.  \\"The Man in Me\\", if you don't already have it, isn't exactly representative of Dylan's work in large, but is a nice ditty.  The Mancini song is filler.  Elvis Costello's \\"My Mood Swings\\" rocks, and I'm glad it was included despite being minutely used in the film.  Anyway, it's a good cd all in all, but only for \\"Hotel California\\", and \\"My Mood Swings\\"...  otherwise the Kenny Rodgers' song is bad, should have been re-edited...  Probably the reason it was obscure to begin with...  The Man in Me is widely available.  My advice... wait and find Gypsy Kings elsewhere.  Same for Costello and Dylan.  Not the best playing mix.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|I HAVE WATCHED THIS FILM A COUPLE OF TIMES AND STILL DO NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND IT.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I loved this movie even though it was animated and geared for children. It had alot of adult humor through out the movie. I repeatedly watch the movie as often as I can. I just love it. I would recommend it for anyone.
0060763280|5.0|This book is great.  It gives specific ways millionaires think compared the way poor (or middle class)people think.  This book was so interesting because the author is so blunt.  He tells you what you can expect if you're thinking the \\"wrong way\\" and what you can do to change your way of thinking.  He also gives a lot of examples of how some of the people he's coached have self sabatoged themselves due to their thinking and once they realized their deep seated thoughts, or conditioning, they were able to change that habit and become wealthy.  This book has helped me dig deep and realize how my way of thinking has hindered me, and I as soon as I did, everything started falling into place and has continued to go well.  I've no longer fell into my old patterns. This is definately a must read!
B000MQC9H4|4.0|The movie was a lot better than I expected.  It was an entertaining movie though not one you can probably see more than once.  Jude Law and Cameron Diaz have an amazing chemistry while I didn't get the same feel between Kate Winslet and Jack Black (Black just doesn't seem to cut it as a love interest). <br /> <br />Law lives with his two daughters and there are some very touching scenes with how they take to Diaz and invite her to be in their bedroom tent.
B000IZJZLM|4.0|This is a wonderful music CD. A perfect blend of 4 tenors. Easy listening even if you don't understand the language.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I'll never understand people who don't see this film for what it is: a heartbreaking work of cinematic art.  I don't know anything about the original novel, so maybe I'm better off, but by the time the credits rolled I was a sobbing wreck.  It is that good. See it. But temper your expectations; people like me have a tendency to get excited about such amazingly original work, and you should discover the film for yourself the best you can...
1400079179|5.0|Great read. Not as good as Angels & Demons, but fun, face-paced, exciting and mind opening. Don't read it if religion is a sensitive subject. Don't watch the movie until you read the book. Keep an open mind and enjoy!
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Madonna never ceases to amaze me!  I've been a fan since 1984 and will always continue to listen to her music.  She's even got fans in my two children - ages 10 and 7!  All I have to say is - Madonna - keep up the great work - you are truly an inspiration to all of us 40+ moms!  Kim D.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|The best movie I have seen in a very long time.  Scott's portrayal of Patton is incredible, the only real deficency being that Patton himself actually had a more high-pitced voice.  This is Patton as the General himself would have wanbted to be portrayed.
B000002PCS|4.0|Some very nice compositions but will only probably grab you if you have seen the movie. Otherwise might seem disjointed. Probably will not have wide appeal, but, as I said, if the movie touched you, you will want the soundtrack.
1582701709|1.0|Utter nonsense designed to appeal to an over self-indulgent society. <br />For the love of God don't be taken in.
B000002IAZ|5.0|The seminal group that produced Neil Young, Stephen Stills, Richie Furay and Jim Messina. This CD shows all the different flavors the members contributed to making Buffalo Springfield songs unique and compositions that you'll want to listen to over and over again (my personal favorite is \\"Broken Arrow\\"). \\"Mr. Soul\\" and \\"For What It's Worth\\" notable radio hits on this CD. Take a trial listen--you might be surprised. Once you've heard the songs a few times you'll want to hear them over again. Another one of my albums that was a favorite in late '60's & early '70's before album wore out!
0307276902|5.0|A Million Little Pieces has gone through much controversey becuase of the fact it is partially fabricated. It might have been dishonest to publish this as a nonfiction story, but that does not take away the messages this story brings.  <br /> <br />When I got this book, I could not put it down. James Frey's account of his (sort of) experience in a clinic to cure his alcoholism and drug usage is amazing. It is full of so much emotion; the characters are diverse and inspiring (some are even a little humorous).  <br /> <br />I was most surprised by the writing style; it is unlike anything I had ever read. There is a lack of quotation marks, but it is not very confusing once you have read a little bit. I loved the short sentences and repetition of words to show how he thinks. I also enjoyed the brief, touching flashbacks and the shocking and vibrant dreams. <br /> <br />This was an excellent, touching, shocking, inspiring, and diverse book; it is unlike anything I have ever read. Don't go bashing this book because it's not all true. I consider it a must-read.
B000000XB9|5.0|Had all my favorites from Green River, Cosmo's Factory, etc. If you are a true CCR enthusiast, I'd recommend this CD for you. No disappointments for CCR fans.
0452287022|5.0|A fantastic book, pure delight. Perfect from the first page to the last: consistent quality. A book one cannot leave aside.
1582701709|5.0|What a terrific collection of work Mrs. Byrne put together! Some of the guest speakers are famous in there own right and it was a pleasure to hear and see them put into words the real power of the Law of Attraction! I highly recommend this DVD as a must see.
B000NA1XSA|4.0|Yes, it's ANOTHER book on the Beatles, but from a unique viewpoint this time: someone who was actually in the studio with the Fab Four.  Emerick has his biases about the lads (just like everyone else), and he probabaly won't change anyone's opinion about their favorite, except maybe George Martin, who is presented as a bit manipulative.  I found myself constantly reaching for my Zune to listen for things I had never noticed, even on songs I had heard hundreds of times before!  A wonderful insight into the innovations that came about due to the \\"primitive\\" equipment of the 1960s.  He speeds over his later careeer with other artists, but of course the book's subtitle is \\"My Life Recording the Music of the BEATLES,\\" not America or Gino Vanelli.
B000KGGLCU|4.0|I love the DVD/CD combo.  This concert rocks.  I wish the CD could have more of the remixes she did in her concert.  But still a great buy.
0783225849|5.0|Psycho is required viewing in more ways than one.  It literally was required for me recently in an American Cinema college class.  But even more importantly, the film is required viewing for any person interested in watching the incredible techniques used by Hitchcock during this film.  Even though I had watched Psycho several times before, it still had the ability to give me chills.  Watching the movie as a student/critic, it was nice to understand the variety of techniques that Hitchcock used from a learned perspective.  An incredible FIVE star film.
6304712499|4.0|To date, this is the best comic book-to-movie conversion. It retains it's comic book feel.  In this sense, it could be compared with Pulp Fiction's portrayal of the pop \\"dime-novel.\\"  The banal one-liners can be seen as a plus in this regard.  The special effects are very good, and ohhhh, that cape!  If you like movies about comic book characters, don't miss this one.  It's at least as good as Spiderman, another good example of the genre.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Well, actually anything with the incredibly talented Kate Winslet is worth watching.  The other stars in the movie were enjoyable.  My wife and I were somewhat split on this movie.  She thought the first half of the movie was a drag, while I thought the scenery and story were worthwhile.  The second half of the movie really took off.  I thought two pivotal plots helped make the movie very good.  The first was when Jack Black (always good) met and developed a relationship with Winslet's character.  The second was when we learned more about Jude Law's family.  The movie built a very strong momentum in the second half.  Had that been matched in the first half of the film, this would have been a 5 star flick.  As it is, this was an enjoyable film, with an intersting plot, made all the more enjoyable because of the movie's stars, especially Winslet and Black.  Four stars and recommended.
B0000667RO|5.0|Well, I'll admit that I'm not the BIGGEST Bryan Adams fan.  I bought this cd solely for the \\"have you ever really loved a woman\\" song... but found that I like just about every song on this cd!  Its great for cleaning the house! I highly recommend this cd!
0763617105|5.0|Owl Babies is a wonderful story and the illustrations are beautiful. My granddaughter and I loved it!!!
B000M5AJQI|5.0|Very intense thriller, no time to be bored, this movie needs no special effects to keep you on your toes!. Oscar winner what does that say? Buy it now. Blue ray rocks!
B00003CXCW|5.0|You'd have to commend silent-film legend Gloria Swanson for an outstanding performance as aging, washed-up starlet Norma Desmond, who's decades out of the limelight, if it wasn't for one fact: I don't think Swanson can get credit for acting in this thinly disguised autobiographical role. Kind of like Vivien Leigh in \\"A Streetcar Named Desire.\\" Toss in a stuffed chimp, Eric von Stroheim in an equally mirrorlike role as a shot director-turned-houseboy, Jack \\"Dragnet\\" Webb in a minor performance before his \\"da-da-da-da\\" days, and silent-film fossil Buster Keaton in his last paying  job before stooping to Annette-and-Frankie beach movies, and this one classifies as a gem. Of course, Bill Holden still can't act, but that's part of his charm. Remember: This one's still big; it's today's movies that got small.
B00005JPG1|4.0|It was interesting to see that when I saw this film, a young dumb couple sitting next to me got up and left about one-third of the way through and it was obvious that they were really expecting to see blood and gore.<br /><br />This is NOT a blood and gore film. There are a couple of scenes in which people are killed, but by no means is that the focus of this film. It's a film about the hunt for the truth--who WAS the Zodiac killer? Did he bamboozle the press, the public, and the police so much that nobody ever knew who he really was? Or was there just so much ignorance about smart police procedure and about analytical method (a la Sherlock Holmes) that it was basically impossible to figure out his real identity?<br /><br />The film pulls no punches--hence it is punchy--in examining how threads are never tied up and how loose ends are never raveled into a cohesive whole. Do key people drink so much that they can't do the jobs they are supposed to do in order to pinpoint exactly who the Zodiac really was?<br /><br />The lead actors, as well as the supporting cast, all turn in compelling performances, but it's not hard to tell that the characters exist to drive the plot. This is not a character-driven film as much as it is a film focused on a whole bunch of people looking in a lot of different directions for roads and clues that lead to a lot of different ends--dead or otherwise.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing and a really interesting departure for the director David Fincher, who previously helmed both Fight Club and Seven.
1582701709|5.0|The movie has more impact, but the book has more info and makes an excelelent gift.
0156027321|5.0|I had been looking at this cover in the bookstore for months and finally decided to get it. The cover art and the story blurb pulled me into buying it. Yann Martel gives us the adventure of Piscine Molitor Patel. The first section of the story deals with Pi and his interest in religion where he establishes himself as a Hindu, Muslim, and Christian. I found this section quite interesting if a bit slow. Part two deals with the sinking of the cargo ship and how the 277 day adventure begins. Pi must learn to live on a lifeboat with various dangerous animals and how to establish territorial boundaries while maintaining his grip on life. Toss in a very strange botanical island and conclude your story with landfall in Mexico after 277 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean. It's a compelling story, entertaining in places, and thought provoking in many others. The last twenty pages were fantastic and a perfect end to a fascinating story spun masterfully by Yann Martel.<br /><br />Overall, absolutely worth reading and you'll fly through the 100 chapters quickly. This could easily be made into a movie ala 'Cast Away'. Here's hoping someone may already be seeking to do so.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Norah Jones' sultry voice come through once again with a winner.
1582701709|4.0|An awesome review and reminder of how I'm living my life... as God is my Universe: Ask and you shall receive.  A true positive uplift in thinking, speaking and well-being.
B000LXH0AE|1.0|If you are thinking about suicide and need to be talked out of it this is the film for you. The plot is so strange and the waste of talent so great that a lethargy will engulf you and you will be unable to move, think or even doze.    Emma Thompson has once again taken her great gifts and squandered them in a film with no merit. Why this lady selects pictures that fail to showcase her abilities is stranger than fiction.    Maggie Gyllenhaal almost as gifted as Ms Thompson follows her example and makes films which only a critic could love. Ms Gyllenhaal is warm funny, clever and winning in a part which will never be remembered.    The annoying GUI graphics popping up throughout the film make viewing the film almost as hard as understanding the plot.    Perhaps fans of Will Ferrell will enjoy this. He is at his least obnixious and makes a character without color prefect by adding an actor without skill or talent.    Run for you life or at least rent something challenging like \\"How Green Was My Valley\\".
B000EHSVSC|5.0|The first time I saw Tora! Tora! Tora! was on the big screen at Naval Hospital, San Diego.  I liked it so much I saw it three nights in a row.  Some years later, I purchased the VHS video tape the day of its release.  I have two DVD versions of Tora! Tora! Tora! as well as two VHS versions of the movie.  I've also watched the Japanese version (with English subtitles).  Tora! Tora! Tora! is a great film but it should not be taken as the ultimate \\"truth\\" about Pearl Harbor and how America got into World War II.<br /><br />Tora! Tora! Tora! used an American director for the American sequences, and two Japanese directors (the first was fired) for the filming of the Japanese sequences.  Much of the original Japanese crew was let go when the first Japanese director was fired (for being way over budget and for producing only 600 feet of film, as I recall).<br /><br />This is a truly excellent movie that men and women can both watch and enjoy.<br /><br />Beware, however, the scenes showing the \\"12 Apositles\\" who were \\"allowed access\\" to `Magic'(decrypted Japanese diplomatic and consular intercepts).  The actual number of Americans with access to Magic was well over 100.  And the President's name was NEVER taken off what the movie calls \\"the Ultra List.\\"  (FDR didn't actually read all the daily diplomatic intercepts, of which the Army and Navy had just over 8,000 in 1941 alone.  Instead, he read daily summaries of the intercepts.  The same applies to most of the senior officers in the War and Navy Departments.)<br /><br />Alwin D. Kramer, Lieutenant Commander, U.S. Navy, and Colonel Rufus Sumnter Bratton, U.S. Army, both worked in different offices rather than in a combined Army-Navy office shown in the movie.  Both men were attached to the Far Eastern Sections of their respective intelligence departments (Office of Naval Intelligence with Kramer; Military Intelligence Division (for Bratton).)  Bratton was officer in charge of the Far Eastern Section of MID.  Kramer was head of OP-20-GZ (translation section in the Office of Naval Communications, OP-20), but he was actually on OP-16's (Office of Naval Intelligence's) payroll.  Tora! Tora! Tora! gives Bratton's middle initial as \\"G\\", but that is in error.  His middle name was Sumnter, as stated above.<br /><br />\\"Magic\\" (again, intercepted foreign diplomatic and consular messages) was critical to what the U.S. (and British) Governments knew of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's diplomatic efforts.  Although the National Security Agency still denies this, we also had a product called Ultra as relates to Japan.  These were intercepted, decoded and translated Japanese naval and military intercepts.  Ultra played a major part in our victory over the Combined Fleet in the Battle of Midway, fought 4 to 6 June 1942.<br /><br />Tora! Tora! Tora! is, as I said, an excellent movie.  It's full of suspense and it is very well acted by both the Americans and the Japanese.  It presents a fair few of both the American and Japanese perspectives that helped lead to \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and U.S. entry into the Second World War.<br /><br />First Lieutenant Kermit A. Tyler is claimed in the movie to say, \\"Well, don't worry about it,\\" when he's told of the large number of planes approaching the Opana Point Radar station from north of Oahu (flying in over Kahuku Point).  Tyler himself later testified that this was his reaction to the radar report phoned to him by Privates Lockard and Elliott.  Here's the rub: The USS LEXINGTON had a radar and visual sighting of two Japanese carrier aircraft approximately 400 miles north west of Oahu on Saturday afternoon, 6 December 1941.  LEXINGTON's radar report was the real first sighting of some of the Japanese aircraft that took part in the raid on Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />American intelligence didn't \\"fail\\" in the lead up to the events of 7 December 1941.  Intelligence, however, isn't always used the way the average citizen thinks it should be used.  Those in high political andmilitary offices have many strategic and tactical matters they have to factor into the decision making process.  Not the least of these was the apathy of the American people in the period leading up to the Japanese raid on our obsolete battleships at Pearl Harbor.  (Our three carriers then in the Pacific, LEXINGTON, ENTERPRISE and SARATOGA were not in port on 7 Dec. 1941.  \\"Target ship,\\" USS UTAH, was moored at a carrier berth off Ford Island.  Battleship COLORADO, that had completed an overhaul at Bremerton, Washington a month before, was still at Bremerton.  WEST VIRGINIA, that was overdue for overhaul, was moored outboard at Ford Island.)<br /><br />This reviewer spent a little over 13 years researching Pearl Harbor on a full time basis.  He has absolutely no animus for the Japanese---nor does he hold any animus for any of the senior Americans involved with Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />\\"Pearl Harbor\\" saved the world (including Japan, in my opinion) from the Nazis.  At the cost of a few thousand Americans, millions of lives were spared in Europe and Asia---and, ultimately---in the U.S. as well.<br /><br />Tora! Tora! Tora! is one of my ten favorite movies.  I've probably watched it over 50 times in the past thirty six years or so.  And I will probably watch it another fifty times or more between now and the time I storm the great beyond.<br /><br />E.G. Marshall (R.S. Bratton) and Wesley Addy (A.D. Kramer) in the film both do exceptional jobs with their acting.  So does every other member of the U.S. and Japanese cast, in my opinion.<br /><br />Great movie---and, in my opinion, a \\"Must have\\" for every American and Japanese who appreciates the very best in direction, acting, scenery, editing, cinamatography, etc.  This is also a good action film---and it is fair to both the Japanese and American perspectives.<br /><br />A \\"Well done!\\" to every member of the cast and crew of Tora!

B0001GL3K4|5.0|I can watch this film over and over.  It makes me laugh and cry each time.
0807126063|1.0|This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. Neither the \\"wacky\\" situations nor the \\"quirky\\" characters are funny / compelling. Ignatius's annoying outbursts of \\"Oh my god!\\" got repetitive after the first 50 times he utters it, and it distanced me from the character. Perhaps if the manuscript got some heavy editing and a bit of stylizing, the novel would have turned out better (there was potential, to be sure). It baffled me that people saw me reading this book in public and would interrupt me to tell me how great it is and how much they loved it.  Because of this, I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. This book seems to be a literary equivalent of \\"the emperor's new clothes\\".
0553804677|4.0|Scott Lynch weaves a very entertaining tale of mischief, mayhem and chaos in this story about a cunning thief, Locke Lamora.  The Gentlemen Bastards are a very unassuming and seemingly insignificant gang of orphaned thieves trained and raised by a sage priest, Chains.  Locke Lamora leads this gang, but not by steel, not by strength, not by magic, but by his cunning, deceptive mind.     THE LIES OF LOCKE LAMORA stands out for its cunny, witty dialogue, hysterical humor, deceptive legerdemains, and of course for the funny, yet gritty, characterization of Locke Lamora.      As Locke tells us at one point in the novel, \\"...there's no freedom quite like the freedom of being constantly underestimated.\\"  One of his cohort-brothers answers, \\"Gods, yes...If we were any freer we'd float away in the the sky and fly like birds.\\"      Unfortunately, our unassuming, yet richest, gang of thieves receive some undesired attention when a mysterious Gray King arrives at Camorr (the city serving as the backdrop for the entire novel).  Our cunning Locke and his Gentlemen Bastards' schemes and thievery go terribly, terribly awry as they face one complication after another.  Locke - short and skinny - must exercise his wit to get him out of the complications that start piling up for his gang.      Scott Lynch's worldbuilding is very thorough, if not prodigiously overdone at times.  His city of Camorr and outlying city-states comes alive vividly, from the feel to the looks, from the smells to the tastes, from the languages and accents to the trade and economy, from the political bureacracy to the entertainment.      I do have two complaints.      It took me two weeks to get through the first 200 pages, while two days to finish the last 300 in this hardcover edition.  It wasn't until after Chapter 5, The Gray King chapter, that events seriously started spiraling out of control for our band of thieves.  I was reading other books during the first 200 pages and I just lost interest in LIES OFLOCKE LAMORA during this time.  But man, do things pick up after Chapter 5.      And secondly, the interludes really bring the momentum of the story to a screeching halt.  Although they were mercifully shorter later in the novel, they were still jarring to me.  The long interludes in the beginning of the book really, really slowed things down.      Otherwise, a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable reading experience, one I would unabashedly recommend to everyone...

B000MNP2KI|4.0|A very good Bond movie with a few strange things such as Bond before '00' status but there were references to 9/11...  So, throw any kind of continuity discussions out the window.  That's OK a very good movie and a very good Bond for what it's worth ! <br /> <br />A 2-disc set that doesn't even include trailers for the movie ... not sure why they wasted the 2nd disc on this one.  NO wonder it was selling for the price a single DVD would sell for.  Not much meat behind the Extras at all.  I'm sure a 3-disc set with real Extras is in the works...

B000MGUZKM|5.0|This is a wonderful CD it is very relaxing. This is what I would like to think music is about. One can understand the words, Randy has a wonderful range and total control of her voice. Joe is outstanding and I am in line for the next release. I recommend this CD to everyone, I am in the 50 plus age group and this is therapy.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|Many extras in this set. Behind the seens footage and background stories.
0061150142|2.0|What a disappointment. I've read everything published by Ms. Picoult and loved nearly all of it until this book. She fails to create a plausible picture of the factors compelling Em to be desperately suicidal, and why-oh-why wouldn't Chris try to get the woman he loves help? -- that is help to live, not to die? Unlike Picoult's usual work, The Pact is awkward and slow-moving, and the plot is full of holes. Too bad; not up to Picoult's standards.
B00000JZC4|4.0|I'd never heard a single song by Filter, that I know of, until listening to this album. I recently bought the Army of Anyone album and saw the band live; Realizing how great of a vocalist Richard Patrick is, I decided to check out this CD. \\"Title of Record\\" is a musically diverse album that begins with 7 great songs and then slowly gets worse. Having said that, that wasn't always my opinion. Writing this, I've listened to the album probably 6 times. I've listened to CD's before and haven't liked them, but after several listenings I begin to like it a lot. The first time I listened to this CD, the only songs I thought were good were \\"Welcome to the Fold\\" and \\"The Best Things.\\" <br />I still think the former is the best song on the album. Now, I said the album was musically diverse. By that, I mean that many of the songs are different in various ways. \\"Welcome to the Fold\\" is a screeching, hard rock song that is nothing short of awesome. \\"The Best Things\\" sounds kind of synth-pop, \\"Take a Picture\\" has a moody, melodic quality to it, and \\"Miss Blue\\" is a 19-minute song that has about 5 minutes of song, 12 minutes of silence, and 1 minute of nonsense. The band has four members; Richard Patrick (vocals & guitar), Geno Lenardo (guitars & bass), Steve Gillis (live drums & percussion), and Frank Cavanagh (bass). Patrick is a very talented vocalist, but mediocre lyricist. He's capable of screaming his lyrics or softening them down. Either way, he sounds great. The guitar playing here is superb, the drumming (although I guess it's a drum machine) sounds cool, and the basslines are terrific. I'm going to separate the 11 songs into Great, Good, and Less-Than-Spectacular category, because none of them are bad. <br /> <br />GREAT: <br />Welcome to the Fold, Captain Bligh, It's Gonna Kill Me, The Best Things, Take a Picture, and Skinny. <br /> <br />GOOD: <br />I Will Lead You, I'm Not the Only One, and Miss Blue. <br /> <br />LESS-THAN-SPECTACULAR: <br />Cancer and Sand (which ispointless, but it's just an intro).  <br /> <br />\\"Welcome to the Fold\\" is, as I said, a terrific hard rock song. \\"Captain Bligh\\" is simultaneously hard rock and soft rock. It shows that Filter can be diverse. \\"It's Gonna Kill Me\\" is slower, but great. \\"The Best Things\\" is a little synth-pop, but very catchy. While \\"Take a Picture\\" and  <br />\\"Skinny\\" are the most radio friendly songs on the album. As for the \\"Good\\" and \\"L-T-S\\" songs, they just suffer from lack-of-catchiness. Although \\"Miss Blue\\" is almost great and \\"I'm Not the Only One\\" have a lot of tone changes and almost achieves greatness. Overall (and keep in mind this is the first Filter album I've heard, so for all I know it could be their worst album), it's definitely worth listening to. I got it for $10 bucks and there are 7 songs I'll listen to a lot more times in the future, so it was worth it. This is a great band and a good album...If you haven't heard Richard Patrick sing yet, you need to get this or the Army of Anyone album (which is actually better than this CD) because he's truly terrific. <br /> <br />GRADE: B+
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It may take you a few episodes to start to appreciate the excellence of this series - it took me through \\"Out of Gas\\" and \\"Jaynestown\\" before I started to see the subtleties in the stories, the characters, and the dialog.  The scripts are uniformly tight.  The acting & directing superb & understated.  I think I've watched through the series several times & see something new each time through.  The dialog & characterizations created in the stories are among, imho, the best television has to offer.  It's a shame that only one season was produced; this is a real gem. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well written, well acted, well filmed, well directed- this quotable series is one to watch many times.  It's even good in slow motion and with the sound off- two true tests.

It's often recalled as a copy of No Dice, their previous album, but I won't agree with that. It's a forgotten classic. But isn't all of badfingers history forgotten. Two members commited suicide because they never got the first place. They were always second best and I don't agree with that. They were a band aparte with some real pop classics on their CV

So, what makes \\"Casino Royale\\" a much more believable and; therefore, a much more entertaining film tan its predecessors? A fresh new actor named Daniel Craig. It's as simple as this...he bleeds, his stunts, a good part performed by him, are not ridiculous. This new Bond feels pain, bleeds, is vulnerable, and performs his missions as a highly trained Secret Service Agent not as a Superhuman...he is real to us.<br /><br />-Kevin82abn
B00003CXA6|1.0|Until the action sequences and battle simulations, this thing plods.  The script is very poor.  Martin Sheen turns in another wooden portrayal.  It had to be long to cover the three days of battle, but basically the only worthwhile aspect is the action, beginning with the struggle on Little Round Top.  Using reenactors and authentic locations was about the only good idea at work in this thing.  Despite all that, probably worth seeing, just for the action, and here and there some of the performances.
0553381695|5.0|A Clash of Kings is George R. R. Martin's second book in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series.  The title alludes to the main focus of the book, which is the conflict between Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Renly Baratheon, and Joffrey Baratheon.  Their quests to rule form the backdrop for the story, while Martin uses the other principal characters to flesh out the events.  Like it's predecessor, \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" anything can happen, and usually does.  This is not the traditional formulaic fantasy novel that you are used to, filled with knights doing heroic things and killing dragons, and wizards casting spells.  All of that exists, but it is much more subtle. This is an extremely violent look at what a fantasy story might be if it actually occurred.  Martin is not afraid to take your favorite character and kill them right off in the course of a few paragraphs.  This book has a very high death count and anyone you got to know in the previous book could easily meet the point of the sword a few chapters in, as the four knigs vie for control of the realm.<br /><br />This book has a heavy focus on Tyrion, Bran, Arya, Jon, and Theon Greyjoy.  There is a lot more action, but it is not lacking for character development.  Even with the dozens of characters Martin has introduced us to, I found it easy to keep them apart because he has done such a great job of developing them, almost too good.  I found it difficult to pick out who the true \\"heroes\\" are in this book, because I know all of them so intimately.  I feel like I should dislike Tyrion Lannister since he is trying to help Joffrey and is an enemy of the Starks, but I spend so many chapters with him I almost want him to succeed.  Martin has cleverly done this in a way that doesn't make it clear who the \\"hero\\" is in this book. It is completely up to the reader's perception.<br /><br />If you are sick of traditional fantasy novels, I strongly urge you to give \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" a look.  This series is definitely the best fantasy I've ever read and it will be hard to pick up another author's book without comparing it to Martin.  I can't stress how important it is to start off with the first novel however, \\"A Game of Thrones.\\"ely the best fantasy I've ever read and it will be hard to pick up another author's book without comparing it to Martin.

B000MCH5P4|2.0|Okay, the positives first:  great soundtrack and scenery; good performances. <br />Otherwise, as noted by Sake Drinker and some other reviewers, many of the characters are so incredibly stupid that it's a wonder they lived this long.  Hiring a nanny who's in the country illegally, taking your employer's kids into another country without permission, allowing your drunken moron of a nephew to drive you and two kids through the desert, jeopardizing the health and welfare of a bus full of people, taking your wife into a nasty little village with no sanitation to see a doctor with dirty fingers...all of these are acts of stupidity committed in the film.  Apparently, they took Stupid Lessons from the characters in House of Sand and Fog. <br />    <br /> <br />

B000N6TX1I|5.0|If the purpose of art is to devestate, to break you down and rebuild you, then this film is a masterpiece.  No other film left me reeling me the way Cuaron's dystopian phantasmagoria did.  The effects lingered for weeks.  I saw the film in December.  It's nearly April now, and I am still recovering.  The cinematography is astounding, and the editing (or lack thereof) is masterful.  It's not a feel-good film.  It's bleak, thought-provoking sci-fi, a chilling caveat.  \\"Children of Men\\" is one of those films that will burrow itself into your head and stay there for a good long time.  When all the other \\"great films of 2007\\" have secured their footnotes in film history books, \\"Children of Men\\" will have it's own chapter. <br /> <br />I'm not being hyperbolic.  Watch for yourself.
B00005NWLO|5.0|This is one of the best all-time live albums in rock history and it depicts Lynyrd Skynyrd at their peak in 1976. Steve Gaines replaced Ed King here and his playing is awesome as is the rest of the band!  No disrespect to Ed King who is an excellent musician and songwriter, but this is the best Lynyrd Skynyrd lineup! Many of these songs are all-time staples: &#34;Sweet Home Alabama&#34;, &#34;Simple Man&#34;, &#34;Workin' for MCA&#34; and &#34;Freebird&#34;. These songs never get old!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|This movie is great for anyone who loves the golden 80s of movies.  Even if you don't love 80s movies and like dancing, romance, rebelious natures, scandalous situations, or even just Patrick Swayze, this movie is for you.  There is sibling rivalry, parental disapointment, a romance with an older more mature man and all without the uncomfortable feelilngs you get with so much drama in today's movies.  It isn't one of those movies that makes you want the moment to end because of how uncomfortable it makes you feel.  It'll leave you smiling and daydreaming.  In fact, whenever my husband saw this movie on tv he made fun of it until one day I asked him if he'd ever actually seen it.  When he answered no, we watched it together and he ended up loving it and bought the soundtrack the next day.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This third incarnation of CASINO ROYALE (Barry Nelson in 1954, Woody Allen in 1968, and now Daniel Craig in 2006) is as close to Ian Fleming's literary James Bond as we are likely to get. CASINO ROYALE catapults the Bond franchise all the way back to the gritty realism of 1963's FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, almost completely excising the many sedimentary layers of spoof, goof, and woof-woof laid on by Eon Productions over the years (Daniel Craig is known as the star of the cult classic LAYER CAKE, and here's another one, but perhaps not to everybody's taste).<br /><br />The now-habitual Bondian overreliance on gadgets is almost all gone, but so, sadly, are Samantha Bond as Moneypenny and John Cleese as Q. Dame Judi Dench reprises M. Monty Norman's electrifying \\"James Bond Theme\\" barely makes it into the film, and the theme song is utterly unmemorable. However, on the plus side, the forced dialogue that has passed for wit since the Roger Moore days is nonexistent; true Bond style has made a thoroughgoing comeback.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the first third of CASINO ROYALE consists of a very predictable set-piece high explosive battle that lacks any clear connection to the rest of the story, and is hard to follow, to boot. It's nothing we haven't seen before, and Daniel Craig lacks the dark solidity of Connery or Brosnan in carrying off the du jour action sequences.<br /><br />Truth to be told, I turned CASINO ROYALE off at just about the point where Bond reaches Casino Royale. Fortunately, I did turn it back on. I say \\"fortunately\\" because the second and third thirds of this movie are so vastly different from its beginning that CASINO ROYALE might as well be two different pictures. It's as though Eon elected to draw in the usual methamphetamine audience to feed them the usual tripe, but then said, \\"Oh, the hell with it,\\" and decided to actually make a Bond FILM for the first time since who-knows-when...<br /><br />Bond is sent to destroy LeChiffre, financier to the world's terrorists, who has compulsively gambled away hundreds of millions of dirty dollars, and is trying to recoup his losses at the ultra-high-stakes poker table of the fabulous Casino Royale. Most of the action takes place around the green baize table, and is undeniably tense in its understatement. Better than an atomic bomb, the real fate of the world rests on a turn of the cards. In that sense, CASINO ROYALE is a true throwback of a film, eschewing the Jerry Bruckheimer Formulary of modern filmmaking. This is a story non plus ultra.<br /><br />Let us introduce James Bond, a spare, angular, wiry blond man who gets battered a lot by some really nasty villains and bleeds (profusely) on his ruffled tuxedo shirts. He suffers a horrific, if prosaic torture session at the hands of his adversary, more personal than any laser beam, and far more effective. Let us introduce James Bond, a man who has just received his \\"00\\" status and still has some qualms about killing (the bizarre torquing of \\"James Bond Universe Time\\" that occurs in the series by granting Bond his Double-O circa 2006 is disconcerting, but ultimately unimportant to the franchise). Let us introduce James Bond, a \\"blunt instrument\\" who must learn to hone himself rapier sharp in order to survive, is betrayed, drinks poison, falls in love, and rejoices over \\"the bit**'s\\" death, but without the omniscience usually granted by his cinematic stewards. This Bond has character development. In other words, let us introduce Ian Fleming's Bond of the novels finally brought to life onscreen.<br /><br />CASINO ROYALE walks quietly and confidently away from it's first hour to deliver a nuanced and intelligent spy movie. Viewers seeking the usual shopworn Bond formula WILL be disappointed. Even on its own terms, CASINO ROYALE has weak spots (mostly in places where the producers veered from Fleming's taut storyline), and Daniel Craig (though he does turn in a fine performance) is definitely not Everybody's James Bond. Still, I have to rate his interpretation of the Bond character below Connery's, but (surprisingly enough) better than almost anybody else's. Eva Green as Vesper Lynd is exotic and unattainable.<br /><br />In short, CASINO ROYALE is a very creditable THREE AND A HALF STAR EFFORT that suffers from its early adolescent angst, wanting to live down to the Bond Formula, but soon, and blessedly, maturing while we look on.haracter below Connery's, but (surprisingly enough) better than almost anybody else's.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|Neil Young has been tantalizing his fans with the release of the Archives project for going on two decades now, starting with the concept of \\"Decade II\\" in the 80's. Here we are in 2007 and the time for this glorious unearthing of the treasures in Neil's catalog has finally arrived. Neil will be releasing various live shows under the Performance Series banner, as well as multiple CD/DVD box sets spanning his entire career, both studio and live.<br /><br />Massey Hall is the second release in the Performance Series (despite its cryptic label of Disc 03). Neil reduces things to their absolute minimum at this gig. Neil's voice, his guitar, and his piano are the sole instruments for the seventeen tracks - his harmonica is nowhere to be found. There are no real guitar solos or significant instrumental breaks.<br /><br />The effect this has is to bring to the forefront Neil's uniquely powerful voice and his emotion-laden lyrics. He sounds wonderful on this release, and the stripped-down presentation truly makes his songs shine. Like the CSNY live album \\"4-Way Street,\\" we start off with a lilting version of the Buffalo Springfield song \\"On the Way Home.\\" Neil intersperses a few other classics in the setlist, such as \\"Down by the River,\\" \\"Don't Let It Bring You Down,\\" and a powerfully emotional \\"Cowgirl in the Sand.\\"<br /><br />However, this was not a nostalgia show. Ten of the songs were brand-new at the time and had not yet been recorded. To their credit, Neil's audience rolls right along with the unfamiliar new material, granting it a respectful silence and enthusiastic applause at the end of each new number (with the exception of the Canada name-check in \\"Journey through the Past,\\" which of course gets a response, seeing as how Massey Hall is a Canadian venue). At this point, the famed \\"Heart of Gold\\" was almost a throwaway middle section in \\"A Man Needs A Maid.\\" It's cool to hear Neil start his most famous/notorious song so casually, and the absolute lack of audience response is fun.<br /><br />The DVD that comes with this version of Massey Hall is terrific. The video footage is dated, but it is undeniably powerful seeing the youthful Neil overcoming the back brace he was forced to wear on this tour and delivering such an incredible set. The disc also contains a wealth of historical information and supplemental video content.<br /><br />I am thrilled to see Neil's Archives finally unfolding and believe this disc is a sure-fire hit for his current fans as well as being a great blind buy if you're new to Neil and want to give his music a shot.ience response is fun. <br /> <br />The DVD that comes with this version of Massey Hall is terrific.

0743496728|5.0|I am an avid reader of Jodi Picoult's books, but this one holds a special place in my heart.<br /><br />As a high school teacher, I found this book eye-opening. The biggest question answered in this book is one that no one dares to ask when an actual school shooting happens - what has gone wrong within society to drive the student(s) to this point? Instead, we immediately blame the child and the child's parents instead of looking at the big picture. And in today's world, that picture is quite large.<br /><br />As a person who was bullied growing up, I could relate with the shooter. I found this to be quite interesting. I have not ever wanted to shoot my classmates for bullying me, but I could see how this could drive someone to commit such a crime - especially when weapons were of easy access.<br /><br />Picoult has done an excellent job of presenting this subject to readers. She reminds us that even the shooter(s) is loved by someone.<br /><br />She takes us into a world I thought I would never understand - the mind of a shooter and the mind of his mother. There are so many levels to this book that I cannot begin to write.<br /><br />If you have ever been gripped by the headlines of a school shooting and wondered, \\"Why?\\" and, \\"Where were the parents?\\" this is the book for you. Picoult answers those questions and more.<br /><br />I was pleased to see that she took such care with this topic, which is something all educators secretly fear.
B00005JOCS|5.0|I saw this film on its' Christmas Day release. The audience was hooked from start to finish.

In addition to my love for the movie, my 1.5 year old daughter likes it as well.  Families with members of all ages can enjoy this movie together.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|This archive release is absolutely remarkable. The sound quality alone is extremely impressive for a 1971 show but considering the quality of the setlist and how well the songs were performed, Massey Hall 1971 is one of the most amazing things ever released by Neil.  <br /> <br />NOW, add the fact that you also get a wonderfully produced DVD with live footage of the show plus home movies from the time period and you really do have a tremendous gem. <br /> <br />In regards to the set list, I'm thrilled to have a 'Bad Fog of Loneliness' which is gorgeous at this show (and very rare elsewhere) but for me the big surprise is the `There's a World'. I never really cared for the way the song was presented on Harvest but here in it's stark naked beauty with just Neil's flawless, unwaivering voice and lovely piano, it's bound to choke you up with tears every time. <br />
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Have you ever seen the original full-length feature of Casino Royale made in 1967? It is unwatchable. For whatever reason, the 1967 version had multiple directors (Ken Hughes and John Huston) and they took Fleming's first Bond novel and turned it into a star-studded, comedian actor filled spy movie satire. In a confusing mess there is even more than one actor playing Bond (Peter Sellers and David Niven).<br /><br />Anyway, in 2006 along comes Martin Campbell (who also did GoldenEye in 1995) to direct and bring integrity back to the film adaptation of Casino Royale. Adding to the 2006 version's strength is a bold new 21st Century Bond.<br /><br />Big and small screen vet Daniel Craig takes over as 007, and he's terrific.<br /><br />Set in the present, Casino Royale shows you a brief look at how Bond attains \\"00\\" (two kills) status, first in a black and white (perhaps a salute Bond's true birthday in 1953) short scene, and then in a surreal pursuit that includes the human ability to fly...well almost...you know, like in those new Kung Fu movies?<br /><br />After these brief opening scenes I was a bit skeptic that the rest of the movie would follow suit in the unbelievable. But I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, there is no lack of the sensational, death defying feats that Bond commits throughout. But it was all done with...what was the word I used earlier?...Ah yes: Integrity.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be some more Bond movies with Craig (at least one is planned for 2008). And as long as the writers and directors can hold together what Campbell has certainly revitalized, the Bond franchise could be something to look forward to for years to come.<br /><br />Casino Royale was great. This is the version that I will point to as \\"the first\\" Bond movie...and perhaps the best.
B0009353IW|4.0|This is an elegantly produced album the captures an LA sound that deserves the treatment given. Each cut grows on you with every play -- the mark of good music.
0062502182|2.0|I have heard people raving about this book for a long time, so when I received it for Christmas last year, I was excited to begin reading it. Unfortunately, however, it wasn't as good as I anticipated. The book is an allegory about a boy-Shepherd who is on a search for his \\"personal legend\\" in the desert. On his way he meets an assortment of people, including an alchemist, who help him on his journey to find his destiny. The concept of the story is interesting and there are a few touching and inspiring bits, but other than that, I found it cheesy and a little too heavy on the religion.

B000M3452Y|4.0|<br />Time has a funny way of sorting out the wheat from the chaff.  25 years ago, Talking Heads were mostly a cult band with a fairly small but devout audience.  Eventually, they hit the mainstream in 1983 when their \\"Burning down the house\\" and Al Green's \\"Take me to the river\\" became huge hits.  Shortly after that, they broke up, David Byrne went on to forge his own sprawling career in music and multimedia art (which he continues to do full force, by the way, for those who may not have been paying attention), and the rest is history, as they say.  <br />  <br />Fast forward about a quarter century, and disciple bands like LCD Soundsystem, !!! (chik chik chik), and a handful of others seem to be sprouting up everywhere.  <br />  <br />In addition to the Talking Heads influence, James Murphy of LCD also blends in a healthy dose of David Bowie, Eno era Roxy Music, The B52s, and even some Modern Lovers, who arguably started the whole sound to begin with, but his core influence is clearly \\"Fear of Music\\", \\"My life in the bush of ghosts\\", and \\"Remain in Light\\".  At times, you get the impression he's making fun of his influences, but, we all know the line between flattery and parody is razor thin.  Just ask Beck (but I digress).  Whatever the case may be, Murphy took all these ingredients, and created quite an addictive sound. <br />  <br />LCD and bands like !!! are getting some airplay on college radio stations.  Recently, as I was driving to work, one of their songs was playing.  I called the DJ and suggested he put something from \\"Remain in Light\\" on right after the song just to illustrate the similarities between new and old.  He says \\"What's the name of the band?\\"   <br /> <br />His question pretty much sums up the typical fan of !!!, LCD, and similar bands. <br />  <br />It's interesting for long time Bowie and Talking Heads fans to see that these bands seem to have quite a following, yet it appears most of the fans don't have any idea of where the sound all originated.   <br />  <br />Byrne has been spotted in the audience at a few of these bands' shows. Makes you wonder whether he's a real fan, or if he's just curious to see how well they're able to pull off what he created two generations ago. <br /> <br />On a broader level, maybe this is what \\"collective consciousness\\" is all about.  Tap into your ancestors, folks, and find the truth. <br />  <br />

B000GTLQXU|1.0|Save your money or give it to charity. This is one of the worst films for a long time. The characters are one-dimensional, you don't care who they are and when they die, you're indifferent. The direction and the screenplay are lame and the acting comes right out of a telephone directory. <br />I was so bored with this film that I can't even bring myself to write anything else about it.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|In this day and age of \\"equal rights\\" for all orientations, it is highly refreshing to see such an old-fashioned macho man like Rocky Balboa.  I am quite a fan of Mr. Stallone and his Rocky series, and found Adrian (his wife) to be a strong feminist-type presence.  It is no secret that she is no longer with us, and I worried my well-fed rear off that her absence would hurt the movie.  Not so, as Mr. Stallone handles her passing with great sensitivity - never letting the audience forget how much that tigress meant to him. <br /> <br />As a confirmed neo-feminist, I find it perfectly acceptable to desire a strong ol' guy while also maintaining my own identity. The reason, I think, that so many people ended up wanting to see this movie is because in these overly sensitive \\"politically correct\\" times, there is a strong appeal in seeing such a straight-ahead tough guy who knows what he wants and how he plans to get it without ever compromising who he is nor conceding to the societal pressures that force so many to sell out their own personal integrity.   <br /> <br />I was a little iffy regarding the character of Marie.  While I applaud Stallone for resisting temptations to fire up a romance between he and Marie, I also felt he was a little too fatherly in his attempts to control her life.  Bravo to her for telling him that he was offering too much, but boo to her for ending up accepting such help.  Not really a part of the neo-femme credo.  Her son Steps was also a little ineffective and wasn't seen learning many lessons in masculinity from Rocky. <br /> <br />Back to the subject of grieving a lost spouse, while I have never experienced that harsh reality - I have relatively recently split with a male companion (shouldn't the term 'boyfriend' end with the onset of middle age?). I was heartbroken and remain very depressed as I feel lonely (not to mention that my biological clock is about to stop ticking, and no amount of winding is likely to restart it).  Watching this movie, I was reminded of the type of love I have been close to many times yet somehow have managed to miss. Why are some of us so unlucky? Don't I deserve my own Rocky Balboa?? <br /> <br />Thank you for indulging me in such a personal take on this movie. I dare not spoil anything about the big fight, but for me it was not all that important.  Stallone crafted an excellent character study and by the time the training sequence begins it is almost beside the point. Not a criticism mind you, it is in fact a huge compliment to the first 70 or so minutes of the movie.  Did I cry?  Yes.  Did I wet myself?  Only a little because of the gargantuan soda I drank throughout the movie.  Kudos to Mr. Stallone, God bless him.
B000001OAA|5.0|This is devil's music.  It sucks you in with it's casual guitar riffs that carry more expression than skill.  Soon you'll be singing along with shirley's sexy voice, echoing things like \\"as far from god as heaven is wide\\".  Next you'll start wearing excessive eye make up and slicing your wrists, then you'll be on prozac.  You see phizer makes music like this to get people depressed and asking for prozac, they make a lot of money doing this.  Haha just kidding, i think, no really her voice is hot as hell and the music is super creative, interesting riffs, cool chord changes, etc.  Be careful you might get hooked!
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I read several negative reviews about this CD and wasn't sure if I should buy it or not, but I love Norah and decided to give it a shot.  The music is incredible and the lyrics, well, a little different but I feel they go great with the music.  On Not too Late, Norah expands her musical sound and I believe she did that by taking us to a place we have not been before.  For most of the negative comments I would have to say that they were perhaps expecting this new CD to be a copy of the first or second, which I suspect comes from pop jazz lovers.  This CD is different and if you are looking for a new CD with the same sound as before you will be disappointed, but if are a true Norah fan and are willing to listen with an open ear then I promise you will not be disappointed.
0307120007|5.0|Now this is a book i LOVED as a child.  I can remember, slipping my small finger through the ring cut out and gingerly rubbing \\"daddy's\\" sandpaper stubble.  Some childhood memories pale when you try to re-live them with your own children- but not this one.  My children giggled each time they touched Daddy's face (who in their case actually looks like their daddy with dark hair unlike my own), and my son especially loved playing peek-a-boo with the boy.  This is a great gift and although it probably won't hold up in order to be passed down (my friends copy went through three kids and is now kept in a box in it's \\"pieces\\") it is definitely a keeper.  You can start introducing this book as early as they are ready to listen to you read- it is very interactive so great for the 9 mos on stage) but don't leave them alone with it until they can restrain from gumming it-- not a board book or baby \\"proof\\".
0307237699|5.0|I am 100% satisfied with the delivery and condition of this book.  I will definitely do business with this seller again.
0439813786|3.0|I would say tbe book is 70% drawings and not much text.  I think it would be a good book for 8 to 10 year olds, but not older than that. This is not to say it is not a good story, it was just not what I expected when I ordered it.
B000LXH0AE|2.0|Where to begin with a movie I must confess to having such strong mixed feelings about?  Let me start with the good, nay, GREAT: Maggie Gyllanhaal is a true delight for we independent women to behold. How great is it to see a college drop-out - someone who probably should be cleaning freaking toilet bowls in a sanitarium for the love of Pete - take control of her own destiny?  Rather than face a dirty, stinky janitorial life (my own personal choice for lowliest profession, and trust me I've done my research) she opened her own bakery. Oh boy, would I love to wrap my lips around one (okay, MANY) of her tasty treats.   <br /> <br />Now the bad, and do I ever mean BAD. The otherwise impressive female Business Owner does not pay all of her taxes.  She has some sort of beef with the government of the United States and as much as I'd love to devour everything she bakes, I'd personally kick her hiney to any other cruddier country and let her commit crimes there!  Can I get an 'amen' from all those who love their country?  Peace.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|After hearing take me out over and over again i figured this band wrote one decent song that was going to be hyped until they faded.  I imagined people would buy their album based on that song and be thouroughly dissapointed with the rest of the material.  Well one of my friends bought it, what fool i thought, after listening through the album while playing ping-pong i realized i was. . .WRONG!  THIS ALBUM IS SICK.  Fun single note guitar riffs that instantly hook and move you, fun upbeat drums keep it moving as well, creative and clear basslines, and of course some occasional whacked out lyrics.  While take me out is a great song there are even better ones.  And Michael is a great song to sing along to, especially in your car at a red light-with the windows down.
1582701709|4.0|I'm only 1/3 of the way through the book and having to drag myself through. The information on the last page that I read is the same as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.  It's valid and true as I'm a believer BUT they could have wrapped the information differently.  I\\"ll keep dragging through.
B00005JPLU|5.0|You may have noted that the movie \\"300!\\" is clobbering all competitors at the box office, seen varying reviews, and wondered if it was worth it. In a word, absolutely!  <br /> <br />The plot is true, and well-known. In the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC an alliance of Greek city-states fought the invading Persian army in the mountain pass of Thermopylae. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Persian King Xerxes led an Army of well over 300,000 men to Greece and was confronted by King Leonidas of Sparta and 300 Spartans (plus some Athenians). He offers them terms/promises/bribes to stand aside and join his empire, and they choose to fight, knowing they will all die, while the folks back home debate about whether to send reinforcements..  <br /> <br />Thar's the bare bones of it, but doesn't cover the truly glorious film that is 300! The photography, enhanced by computer graphics, is shockingly beautiful. The dialogue and acting is terrific. Gerard Butler's King Leonidas makes Russell Crowe's Maximus (Gladiator) look like a choir boy in comparison. Can't see how you could do better short of Richard Burton. There is an excellent extensive female part, and it would be a mistake to think of this as just a \\"guy's' movie\\". There is even some definite humor. My wife loved it. You WILL be drawn in and emotionally involved. Quite a few audiences seem to applaud at the end. They should.  <br /> <br /> <br />You may have heard this is violent. Well,sort of. It is a genuine epic with many fight scenes. The film editor never uses the same camera angle twice, and the combination of color and shading makes for an absolute beautiful vision. Much thought had also been put into the music, and sound effects chosen by the director. But there really is little blood and no spilled innards, though there are antiseptic severed limbs and heads.  <br /> <br />You may have heard that this is a \\"political'\\" movie, and it is true the the Iranians are not fond of it. I didn't see it that way. Greece WAS the foundation of Democracy and Western Civilization, and the invading army WAS Persian. Can't change reality.  <br /> <br />In sum, the movie really is the words that are over-used. Spectacular. Epic. Glorious. Beautiful. Heroic.  <br /> <br />Five stars. For sure. Go see it. And don't wait for the DVD. <br />
1582701709|1.0|Very disappointed in the book.  It contains quotes from various people and while the quotes are food for thought, the book falls way short of what I anticipated.
B000KX0IOK|1.0|This one one of the most reprehensible films I've had the displeasure of viewing. That is saying something, my friends. There is no nudity. Relatively little violence. Moderate profanity, but nothing I've never heard before. So why was this movie so supremely offensive? <br /> <br />Easy. It glorifies pathetic drug users, it makes a mockery of the noble profession of 'school teacher', it makes excuses for low-income citizens becoming drug pushers. I was disturbed by this film's endorsement of all the worst elements of our ever-declining society. <br /> <br />Ryan Gosling, who was inexplicably nominated for an Academy Award for this role, looks like a thinner David Arquette (but craps out in trying to out-act him).  His method of teaching a history class is rambling on about esoteric philosophies and never managing to put them in any historical context. In other words, he represents 95 percent of U.S. public school teachers - nothing that comes out of his mouth is relevant. <br /> <br />Also distressing was the racial message delivered so clumsily and awkwardly throughout.  Basically, it says those with white skin are inherently \\"bad\\" and those with darker pigment are \\"awesome.\\"  Please give me a break.  I have so many friends of color, in fact I have been occasionally referred to as an \\"honorary woman of color\\" despite my bleach-white skin, and these trusted friends agree with me (at least the ones who have seen or heard about the movie).  The teacher played by Gosling is racked with 'white guilt' for no good reason.  <br /> <br />Essentially this is a depressing downer of a movie that paints a picture of a society so awash in hedonism that I nearly hyperventilated during the end credits.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|Great album, catchy but not overtly so, from soft silly vocals on \\"doll\\" to the semi metal screams of \\"enough space\\".  Even though my hero and everlong have been played millions of times they're still great songs and all the other songs on the album are just as good, if not better.  Play it right through, there's no slow spots.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|This has always been such a favorite of mine.  I bought another one because my daughter borrowed it and refused to give it back because it is now her favorite also !!!!
0792839692|4.0|Good film. Dated though and the picture quality needs to be remastered. The acting is superb and no doubt lifts the film. They were so believable! If you love sci-fi flicks this one is a must.
