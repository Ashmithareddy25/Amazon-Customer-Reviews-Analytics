B0074V3712|5.0|*****<br /><br />\\" I am a big Wilson fan, but I didn't find anything new in it, although for some readers it might be a good introduction to a variety of ideas such as eusociality. I was surprised to see the main blurb as \\"A monumental exploration of the biological origins of the human condition!\\" -- James D. Watson.<br /><br />Reading Edward Wilson's overwhelming argument in \\"The Social Conquest of Earth,\\" about the biological origins of complex human culture, made me pause in order to reflect for a while. Professor Wilson, 82, has made a sweeping scientific career and acquired literary distinction by bringing Homo sapiens closer to our natural world, integrating various phenomena within the holistic subjective evaluation of relative significance of evolution. Never shy about tackling big questions, veteran evolutionary biologist Edward Wilson delivers a thoughtful if contentious explanation of why humans rule the Earth.<br /><br />It's not every book that is preceded by a critical public letter from more than 130 of the author's peers, as Wilson's was when a legion of biologists wrote to Nature last year to make known their belief that his new line of thought is defective. His well-crafted and captivating, thesis, presented with equanimity is full of both virtuosity and raw, abrupt assertions that are nonetheless and serenity even though a firestorm of disagreement surrounds them. The Social Conquest of Earth\\" is a reversal of Wilson's own early view on the evolution of altruism, driven by kin rather than group selection.<br /><br />This issue is brought to the fore by social insects like bees and ants, which exhibit the Darwinian paradox of evolved sterility. The controversy is, Professor Wilson is challenging one of the central pillars of modern evolutionary biology, his own established theory, that natural selection acts far more strongly on individuals and genetic relatives than on broader social groups.\\"Now Wilson promotes the highly contested idea that group selection is the driving force, favoring self-sacrificial behaviors in individuals that benefit all group members,\\" in the words of Professor Michael Gazzaniga, in the NYTimes.<br /><br />Unless you are an authority on the evolutionary biology bible, written by Darwin, and edited by Dawkins, you will agree with me that the book is a marvelous review of the Evolution Revolution, written in verse and artful illustrations by an eminent scholar who states that we came out of biology. He masterfully demonstrates that we are the mightiest of all animals, due to our special human 'eusociality', our elevated social skills. While being driven  together in greater cooperation, that will empower us to conquer the mundane evils of this world, which is resulting in suffering; harm and distress.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0674002350 Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Edition]]selection is the driving force, favoring self-sacrificial behaviors in individuals that benefit all group members,\\" in the words of Professor Michael Gazzaniga, in the NYTimes.<br /><br />Unless you are an authority on the evolutionary biology bible, written by Darwin, and edited by Dawkins, you will agree with me that the book is a marvelous review of the Evolution Revolution, written in verse and artful illustrations by an eminent scholar who states that we came out of biology.

B003YL4KS0|5.0|I am a Devacurl convert as of about 4 months ago.  I have very delicate cherub curls, and my hair has been breaking off like it's going out of style for the past many years.  I have been brushing, combing, blow drying and flat ironing my hair to death.  By fighting my natural texture, I was killing my hair.  I decided to try something new, because I have spent thousands of dollars following my hair dresser's suggestions, and all of those suggestions have not helped me successfully grow my hair out.  I have very fine hair but lots of it, and it tends to break once it gets to my chin.  After doing EXTENSIVE research, including reading several clinical research papers, I concluded that sulfates were the reason for my hair breakage.  It isn't that sulfates are bad themselves, but its the fact that they strip my hair of the natural oils that protect each strand and keep them hydrated.  By stripping the hair of moisture, frying it and brushing it, my hair was brittle and totally destroyed by the time it reached my chin.  Washing hair with sulfates remove oil and more protein from the hair than using non-sulfate shampoos.  When I was doing all this on a daily basis, my hair was half broken off by the time it reached my shoulders.  This made growing my hair out nearly impossible.<br /><br />I started using the Devacurl Lowpoo/One condition, and after about a month, I moved on to use the Devaurl NoPoo and One Condition every other day.  I have completely stopped brushing my hair. I follow the curly girl method almost perfectly, and my hair has never looked better.  It's hydrated and it looks full and thick.  My hair is finally happy, and I now get compliments on it often.  My hair routine only takes 2 minutes, as apposed to 45 minutes that I used to spend killing my hair with various torture devices (blow dryer and flat iron).<br /><br />Here is my routine that I swear by:<br /><br />I get in the shower and wet my hair with warm water, apply nopoo to my fingertips and then massage it into my scalp for an entire minute.  I do not bring it through the ends of my hair.  I don't touch the ends of my hair when I am cleansing my scalp.  I then rinse my hair under the water of the shower for about 30 seconds.  Then I apply the One Condition from the roots to the tips of my hair, and I use a Mason Pearson wide tooth comb to distribute the conditioner and detangle my hair while in the shower.  I also use the comb to make a straight part in my hair (if I don't do this, my hair is kind of a mess at the top).  I wash out the conditioner and I gently cup my hair with a microfiber towel once I get out of the shower.  I use the microfiber towel to dry my hair with the gentle up motions; it's not really scrunching, it's more like scrunching with an open hand.  I then put a little bit of Devacurl Foam on the roots, and a tiny bit of Devacurl Angel on the tips.  I let my hair air dry and I don't touch it until it's totally dry.  The products help the hair stick together while it's drying, so it maintains the curl pattern without frizz.  When my hair is totally dry, I then gently shake the hair at the roots, and fluff up the ends by going around my head with open palmed \\"scrunches.\\"  I never rake through my hair from roots to tips with my fingers when it's dry as this leads to a fluffy/frizzy mess.<br /><br />The Devacurl products also don't have silicones that aren't water soluble, so you don't have to use harsh cleansers to avoid product buildup.  This is a VERY important piece of information.  If you are going the no sulfate route, make sure that you are using products that have ingredients that are water soluble.  If not, you will have a massive buildup of products in your hair.  I was using a silicone mousse, and it made my hair look about three shades darker.  I thought the color change was because of my natural oils, but after I used a clarifying cleanser, the silicones washed out and my hair went back to it's normal texture and color.  Siliconesare great for my hair, but I can't easily wash them out of my hair without using drying shampoos, so I now avoid them.<br /><br />It takes awhile for curly hair to get used to not being abused, so you should expect a period of chaos on your head for a bit, but once that period is over, you will be so happy you did this.  I am never going back to regular shampoos, and I don't plan to brush my hair ever again (even though I truly love my Mason Pearson brush, I will have to find another use for it).<br /><br />UPDATE: Since I started (several months ago) applying the curly girl method to my hair, I have not found ONE broken hair anywhere; yes, I actually check when I find them to see if the root is attached.  I used to find broken off ends everywhere but those days are over :)are great for my hair, but I can't easily wash them out of my hair without using drying shampoos, so I now avoid them.<br /><br />It takes awhile for curly hair to get used to not being abused, so you should expect a period of chaos on your head for a bit, but once that period is over, you will be so happy you did this.

B005LAII0I|2.0|Imagine the oldest fairy tale there is. Have you got it? No, not that one. Have you got it now? Yeah, that's it. Now ask yourself if it can be made into a movie, again? The brain trust at Relativity Media asked themselves that question and came back with a resounding yes.<br /><br />  Snow White (played by Lily Collins) is the only child of a benevolent king, referred to only as The King (played by Sean Bean) and his late wife who, except for the detail that she died while giving birth to Snow (Collins), is not referred to at all. The King was raising Snow so that she might one day rule over the kingdom, but he was consumed by a beast known to inhabit the woods long before that could happen. With The King gone and Snow not yet ready to take the throne, the duty passed to his wife Clementianna (played by Julia Roberts). With her husband gone, Snow is the only threat to The Queen's rule, so she keeps her confined to the castle. When speaking to Snow, she claims it's for safety reasons, but when her subjects inquire about the matter, she makes it appear as though the princess they've never seen is in a fragile state as a result of either physical or mental illness. All the while, her excesses have seen a once happy, wealthy kingdom turned into a fiefdom in dire financial straits populated by overtaxed miserable subjects. Her closest advisor, Brighton (played as an obsequious toady by the talented Nathan Lane) informs her that her best hope is to marry a Baron who has made numerous overtures in the past. But while the Baron possesses the wealth she desires, he is older and not particularly attractive. Then, as luck and uncreative storytelling would have it, a prince from a wealthy, faraway kingdom (played by Armie Hammer) is robbed, bound, and gagged by bandits inhabiting the woods, freed by Snow White, who has left the castle without the Queen's permission, and then brought to the castle by the royal guard so that she might offer an apology and, of course, the King's vacant seat in the throne.<br /><br />  Now, of course, there have been numerous successful films based on fairy tales. Tangled (based on Rapunzel), Beauty and the Beast, and the original Disney version of Cinderella in a film simply titled Cinderella. While the two older films may not have the same appeal with the youth audience that Tangled does, they have greater appeal with older audiences, not just because of nostalgia, but because they are quality films. So, if you're a parent and your children have been begging you to take them to this film, make whatever effort you can to convince them to watch the older classic film or the more recent Disney features based on other fairy tales. This one just doesn't hold up.acant seat in the throne.<br /><br />  Now, of course, there have been numerous successful films based on fairy tales.

B002S8AGZG|5.0|This is an exceptional movie that nails The Taming of the Shrew perfectly, and with modern comedy.  A wonderful cast, excellent witty dialogue, and true-to-life situations make this the best Shakespeare adaptation since West Side Story.  There is no better, maybe an equal with Get Over It.  As an English Teacher, I WISH I could behave as the teachers do here, and as a former student, I WISH I attended Padua High.  I showed it to my seniors, they love it.  Way too smart a movie to be grouped in with other teen movies, I guarantee Mom and Dad will love it as much or more than their kids will, especially Larry Miller's dad part.  It's how we wish the world would be, but isn't.
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|What happens when you take an overweight, intelligent, socially awkward \\"adult\\" and put him in the same police academy with same emotionally stunted athlete who made his life miserable all through high school?<br /><br />  Morton Schmidt (played by Jonah Hill) had dyed-blonde hair and braces in the twelfth grade so, naturally, when he attempted to ask out his high school crush, he choked and was shot down anyway. While this was devastating to him, Greg Jenko (played by Channing Tatum) found it hysterical and made no effort to hide it. The shoe was eventually on the other foot, however, when the principal revealed that Jenko (Tatum) would not be allowed to graduate. Years later, in the police academy, Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko meet again, they decide to help each other overcome their respective shortcomings and, in so doing, graduate. But a screw-up results in their first arrest being invalidated and, as punishment, they're reassigned to a program that was discontinued in the 80's and brought back because \\"the guys upstairs ran out of ideas years ago\\". Their new headquarters: 21 Jump Street. Under the direction of their captain (Ice Cube), they're sent undercover as high school students to find the supplier of a new drug that recently caused the death of a white high school student after he'd posted a video of himself under the influence of said drug and posted it on YouTube.<br /><br />  The inside jokes about the basis for this movie being a television program from the 80's and cameo appearances from two former cast members are hilarious. Also entertaining is the sharp contrast in youth culture between today and ten years ago. Hill is basically playing a role he's played several times before, ditto for Tatum, and Ice Cube, playing a role that even the cast admits is clich&eacute;, is fantastic. If you haven't already, see this movie.
B002BWP49C|4.0|This movie was, in my opinion, a much-need return to the storytelling format in the first movie. The second and third movies hadn't delivered on the same level. But, this was a gripping movie. I was curious how they were going to tackle all the events that take place, such as the pregnancy, but it was extremely well done; you felt the distress, the fear, and the excitement that the characters experienced. I also think the acting was much improved, particularly by the lead trio. And cinematically, well, it was impressive.<br /><br />The only thing I would say is that the beginning was kind of dull. Everyone was waiting on bated breath for Bella's wedding and deflowering, and while the ceremony was beautiful and the honeymoon pretty, I didn't connect with the characters throughout the whole exchange. It was visual, not emotional. Throw in a dose of morning sickness, though, and away we go!<br /><br />I also want to add that the behind-the-scenes extras were especially interesting, particularly the demonstration of how they turned Bella from a healthy teenager into a dwindling, starving figure. Awesome.
0143034901|5.0|Shadow of the Wind is a book everyone can enjoy.  It is a suspenseful novel with twists and turn that force the reader to think up what might happen next.  Although it may seem a bit slow in the beginning, it gets more exciting and thrilling throughout.  The first person style of the book is a benefit of it, I believe.  It makes the reader more enthralled in the book and want to actually \\"be\\" Daniel Sempere.  His thoughts become the reader's thoughts and most of the book is from Daniel's point of view (besides the letters).<br />  Several magical elements contribute to the magical realism in Shadow of the Wind.  These are the events in the novel that are too good to be true.  They can also be occurrences in the book that could never happen in real life.  The magical elements are part of the book's thrilling twists and turns.  Carlos Ruiz Zafon is excellent at writing parallel stories with two very similar characters in the book.  There were parts that made me sad and other parts that made me ecstatic; you know a book is decent when it plays with your emotions.<br />  It is a page turner, and it made me so excited to see how everything would unravel at the end.  Some parts are a little hard to understand, so it is important to possibly re-read some chapters if you missed anything.  Younger audiences may not want to read Shadow of the Wind  because of several occurrences of adult content and language, but overall, I would recommend this to anyone who loves thrillers and mysteries!
0345803485|5.0|This book was beyond awesome.  Christian and Ana were terrific together in their relationship.  You don't know whether to love Christian or despise him.  Ana was so loving to him despite all his conflicts and adolescent behavior.  I also loved the 2 following books as well. I give it 5 stars.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|So I read these reviews and often base my purchases on the prevailing sentiment (anita blake notwithstanding )  I love urban fantasy, vampire novels, vampire shows, the works of moning, j r ward, and many others....I just recently have forayed into the subgenre of BSDM and have found it riveting, hot and completely unexpected...I was expecting more of the same, minimal plot, fantastical characters and lots of steamy sex scenes, (the better written ones are few and far between).  I am delighted to say that this trilogy is not only hot, but well written, steamy, so steamy I need windshield wipers on my kindle :D  and it is different from my usual author's path.  Usually there is the guy and the girl and through many trials and tribulations they connect (sooner or later) and lots of hot sex ensues....with the second book \\" new guy, new girl\\", it follows a predictable pattern....This is amazingly different and is a hawt!!!, beautifully written love story with the characters so well developed you will laugh with them (\\"inner goddess\\"} cry with them and sometimes...in the Red Room of Pain you will...ahem....maybe I have said too  much......For anyone who loves a good \\"bodice-ripper\\" this is for you!!!
B0071MV540|4.0|Usually most movies with this many big name actors don't ever really seem to be very good but this one is an exception.  All the actors work well with one another to make a really funny movie.  Would definitely recommend!

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game I play it often not much Bsd to say about it I encourage anyone to play that can
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Having read all the hype and other reviews on this book (both good and bad), I decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did because it was an enjoyable read, a book I didn't want to put down. The whole dom/sub scenes of the book I wasn't sure I would care for, but as part of the story it made for an intriguing read.  There is a connection between the 2 main characters and with every turn of the page, you want things to work out for them.  I'm looking forward to downloading Book 2 today!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I can now control how long my child is online, and play fb games on my kindle fire.  Well worth the money.  And a huge plus for me is being able to turn off my computer from bed or just quickly because of an oncoming thunderstorm.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|The Descendants was a very entertaining movie.  At no point was there a \\"slow period\\", where you wanted the movie to end.  Indeed, I never wanted the movie to end.
B00005JY1O|5.0|I really can't say 1 darn thing new that hasn't been said about this pivotal master piece that hasnt already been said. Except to say that if you haven't heard the mono mix you really are missing the \\"knock out punch\\" this LP has to offer. Mind you, I have only heard 3 or 4 cuts from Hwy 61 from the mono compliation of the new Dylan mono box but you really hear what you have been missing. Dylan in 65 was pretty lean & mean as far as accompanyment & some of the tones are pretty \\"shrill\\" sounding in stereo. There is something about having the bass in dead center that really drives this baby home (sonically speaking). Your current choices are the new mono box set or check out the Sundazed mono LP's of Dylan & other artists. At least with Sundazed you can pick up the single sets but they are pricey ($18.00 plus each)
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Really great! I really enjoyed playing it. Really had a lot of good features. I love the many different things you can do.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game love it very addictive. great time killer. must have cures bordem. so fun get this game now. awwww yeah!!!
B00632HWOG|3.0|I didn't try the app after reading the reviews but wondering if everybody knows you can use the email app on kindle fire. It doesn't have the &quot;Yahoo&quot; lable but you don't get the ads either.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is the first Dream Theater album I stumbled upon and it might have taken about three listens for it to sink in, but after that, I have never had an album instantly click and sound awesome like that in my life. This is the heavier Dream Theater album, with crunching guitars, thunderous drums, and thick bass tones. I don't really know for sure if this is the best place to start with this band, but I sure am glad I started here.<br /><br />Every song is driven by different metal riffs (some songs have mellow passages and one song starts as a ballad) that all interweave within each other so well. This is as technical, musical, and progressive as metal gets. Each song is pretty long, so this album takes a lot of concentration. Like I said, after a few listens, this album became an instant favorite. I didn't care for the singer at first but his voice grew on me. The band is at the top of their game here; John Petrucci delves into thrash riffs, emotional soloing, and some cool chords and sounds. Mike Portnoy's fills are amazing, and his general ability to lay down the beats is impressive, being that the time signature and riffs change quite often. Jordan Ruddess plays some great classical sounding piano solos, dabbles with some sound textures, and drives the band at times with his sharp and jazz toned yet somber chords. Just listening to this album in one sitting is a trip. The fact that these guys play at this level is just incredible.<br /><br />I can't tell you how much I love this album, and my favorite track is the closer, In The Name Of God. It has profound and truthful lyrics, with lots of awesome riffage that sounds Middle Eastern at times and guitar noodling as well. The chorus is super catchy and it closes with a cool chord fragnment. I would recommend this disc highly to anybody looking for sophisticated and well played metal music.

Also win/earn/find acorns without a lot of hassle.<br />One complaint tho. I have updated several times and completely powered down my kindle fire but still having problems visiting other villages. Managed to visit 2 and &quot;like&quot; them but only got credit for liking, not for visiting. So cannot complete that goal. BUG ALERT please fix.<br />All-in-all. Aside from a few bugs I find this game quite enjoyable.
1575666286|1.0|It seems to me that this Gerson therapy is a bit overboard.  One has to find organic vegetables in such quantity that they can be juiced to produce 13 eight ounce glasses of juice per day and, of course, drink them.  While resting from all this, one must take several coffee enimas. All this would hardly leave time to have a life, let alone earn a living as, I would guess, one couldn't get very far from a toilet.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I LOVE this app! It is, by far, one of the best apps I've ever downloaded. The music is so relaxing and I love that I can actually interact with it to create my own. They were smart to allow recording and downloading to your computer, as well as song sharing. And, it also thoughtfully has a sleep function. It's easy to use. The kids are going to love it, too! Thanks to the developers for putting this out there!

Diana's style of writing is not only entertaining, but also makes the reader feel that the storyline could REALLY have happened. (?)  I must admit I'm half-way through the 3rd book of series, and logged onto the Kindle site to take a sneak-peek at the 4th book.  I just KNEW Jamie and Claire would find each other again.  Looking forward to downloading each book of the series.  Just too fantastic.

B000000YNZ|5.0|It seems he never ran out of ideas to come up with progressions and voicings back in the days nobody has heard of before. Clearly he had an unbelievable ear. He to me is the true chess master of all Jazz pianists. He was able to play a voicing that only 4 chordsor proggessions later turned into a resolution and made all sense. The tension he was able to create by doing this without force and all by staying very mellow and low profile, almost under the radar, was just second to none. The only downside again is his drug lated life style like with so many. But obviously one doesnt go without the other...However Bill, what you did in your personal life was nobody' s business but yours and you blessed us with such beautiful music. I will never forget your intro to Miles Davis' \\"bye bye blackbird\\".

B00000J7S8|4.0|to be brutally honest: I dont know, just a feeling. Can you really give 5 stars for something that is \\"just\\" interpretations of old classics? Take Monk for example? If you give him 5 stars for being a genious, is Diana really within the same class.<br />She' s got the looks talent and coolness. And at rather early ages she is already the artist that many not even become in age: mature and relaxed. But never the less it stays a \\"Classics\\" album...However to all of you who are fans of real jazz - you will not regret, as someone here put it \\"parting your money for it\\"
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was a bit apprehensive purchasing this based on all the hype, but was not dissappointed after reading the series, the story gets stronger as you read aon is not at all predictable. The authors development and unique attributes in each of the characters makes this trilogy very rich and you loose yourself in the book. I couldn't put it down! Recommend to anyone that enjoys a complicated love triangle, action/adventure and thriller all combined. Happy Reading :)
1423113462|5.0|Hello, I bought this for my 14 year old Son who is addicted to reading Percy Jackson books. He said This is a book you must have if you are bored of the same stuff happening in the Percy Jackson series. He read it all in 1 day.The book is really good if you like The Lightning Thief.

0985114606|5.0|Let me start by saying Ive read a couple of Sylvia Day novels and liked them pretty well.  Two were bordering on great and a couple others not so much.  This one definitely hit the spot.  It was very, very good.  As others have said, it is very much simular to 50 Shades which I loved.  This was just as good.  Great job Sylvia!  I look forward to the next book.

B004K4IZ54|5.0|If you hated Tron the first time round, you'll probably dislike it this time too.  It's just a really geeky thing.  Tron has subtle religious overtones to it.  These become much more obvious in Tron Legacy.  There is a bit of Rene Descartes' \\"Evil Genius\\" thought experiment snuck in there too.  I was a bit disappointed by the lack of stark flat surfaces that were common in the first movie, but I guess that's technological progress.  I was impressed by the brief touching on of society in the computer world.  One thing that still bugs me is the presence of food.  Maybe it can be explained away as Flynn conjuring up something for his son, but it kind of throws me for a loop as to how I used to understand how things went inside the computer.  Some loose ends from the first movie are tied up and plenty more are left loose for the next installment.  If I had to give this film a label, I guess I'd call it a philosophical fantasy.

0439023513|1.0|\\"Boring\\" is such a crass and simple word to use when describing any book, but in the case of Mockingjay, the third and final installment of Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games series, it really is the only adjective that fits.<br /><br />The first book, while perhaps not built around the most original premise in the world, was nevertheless captivating and what one would call a real page-turner. Character relationships were clearly defined and fleshed-out, the bleak oppressiveness of the Capitol loomed around every corner, and though you knew Katniss, the central heroine, would ultimately survive to see another day, the reader truly found themselves engrossed and on the edge of their seat waiting to see what sort of grim turn of events would happen next. (Or at least I did!) The second book, Catching Fire, was a lot of fun in itself but at the end of the day didn't add anything substantial to the arching storyline; instead it basically served as a vehicle to introduce more characters whose roles would be more clearly defined later. Not awful by any means, but really just a rushed rehash of the first book when you get down to it.<br /><br />And then there's Mockingjay, which attempts to wrap up the aftermath of the preceding events, with less than remarkable results. First let me say that I had no problem with the direction in which Collins chose to evolve (or devolve) some of her characters, mostly concerning the Katniss-Gale-Peeta triangle. I know many readers are \\"team fill-in-the-blank\\" with these sorts of series and tend to base their disappointments on how they think things SHOULD have played out for their favorites characters, but for me it's more about the generally dry, disengaging writing style than any specific plot points or character revelations. (It's true, some actions were out of left field and didn't quite gel with the way a character's personality had already been established, but that's a more or less subjective argument I won't get into. Plus I came to expect and accept those kinds of continuity errors in multi-volume stories such as this a long time ago.) In short, my main gripe lies within the fact we get nearly 400 pages of blah blah blah - that's to say, overly drawn out technical descriptions of government diplomacies, strategized battle plans, futuristic weapon technologies, and bizarrely named characters who don't stick around long enough to care about - and then suddenly everyone's life is sorted out in the last two pages. Literally. I'm not asking for a happily ever after here - in fact I don't see how there COULD be one - but loose ends are anticlimactic in the extreme and several are tied up \\"offscreen,\\" so to speak, if at all. I get that war is a depressing and harrowing thing to live through, and I half wondered if Collins went avant-garde on us by intentionally making the story tedious and plodding so the reader could share in the sentiment. But then I reconsidered who the typical target audience is for the Hunger Games and thought, wow, that would sure be cruel of the author if it were true! No, that's not a jab at America's youth - I'm sure no one of ANY age would want to sit down and read somebody's dissertation on abstract dystopian wartime regimes for pleasure, which this came dangerously close to, lol.<br /><br />In any event, it's unfortunate how what started off as such an exciting series could fizzle out so quickly. I think the main problem is that there simply wasn't enough plot to stretch over three installments to begin with, and I'm not exaggerating when I say books 2 and 3 really could have been reduced to a five or six page epilogue at the end of book 1. Tastes and opinions differ, obviously, but as someone who can normally find some aspect to appreciate about a piece of literature even when I don't especially love it, it fell totally flat for me. I praise the author for the themes she was trying to explore, and I'm sure it rightfully sparked debates and thoughtful discussions in homesand classrooms all across the country. But like I said, trying to get three whole books out of it was stretching it pretty thin to the point where it eventually felt more like a chore to keep on reading than an enjoyable pastime, and whatever messages she was trying to get across suffered because of it. Incidentally, I recently read that the Mockingjay movie will likely be split into two parts a la Twilight and Harry Potter. Considering how little gets accomplished in the book, I shudder to think how they'll pad that much screen time.and classrooms all across the country.

014312093X|2.0|It may be blasphemous to criticize an author with the stature of LeCarre', but, I read for enjoyment and found precious little in this work. The usual grist for the spy writer's mill: car chases, fist fights and shootouts, are absent, leaving the reader with a cerebral and convoluted plot that becomes more tedious the farther you read. The story moves along with painful slowness as the Brits try to find a mole in their system through exhaustive attention to every detail of the investigation. This book is definitely not a page turner, and will not keep you up late at night.
B004M5HUXE|3.0|I had no issues with OCR character recognition issues or editing problems whatsoever in this version of the book.  This is often a problem with the classics I buy.  However...I bought this book after seeing it suggested in an Entertainment Weekly sidebar about books recommended along with 50 Shades of Grey (sort of a historical version of 50 Shades of Grey, if you will.)  Now, I read Sons and Lovers by D.H. Lawrence in college and liked it quite a lot, so I figured what the heck?  I'll give Lady Chatterly's Lover a try.  I could only muscle my way through the first half of the book before I gave up.  It was horrible.  Just horrible.  A few flashes of Lawrence's brilliant mind here and there, but so vague and meandering and phallo-centric I just couldn't stand to keep reading.  If you are hoping for a typical \\"classic\\" type read, this is not it.

B0079XNWQA|4.0|Jason Mraz could wrap his voice around names from the phone book and wring a wide spectrum of emotions from them, and several selections from new album \\"Love is a Four Letter Word\\" showcase that glorious range of his. Because he has such a swoon-inducing set of pipes and a remarkable ability to craft colorful melodies that showcase it he never fails to sound anything but resolute and inviting, helping his lesser tunes stand tall next to his stronger work.<br /><br />Now firmly in his 30s and a decade into his career, Mraz often sounds comfortable yet conflicted on \\"Love is a Four Letter Word,\\" trying to embrace his sincere (but often confining) peace-and-love persona and also find breathing room beyond it. This, as well as the fact that he is long-entrenched in a relatively stress-free life, no longer needing to worry about acquiring new fans or hits and heeding advice from his own personal \\"joyologist,\\" inevitably makes him a different man and, therefore, artist.<br /><br />He is at that once-in-a-career place creative souls reach (when lucky) where the old incentives to create art are suddenly replaced by new ones. He does not entirely succeed at getting out from under the clutter of expectations of fans and record company bosses, and for that reason a few tunes (\\"Everything Is Sound,\\" \\"Living in the Moment\\"), while always lovely and listenable, sound mannered and even a tad forced, attributes which never applied to his former work.<br /><br />Considering the expectations heaped upon him in the wake of \\"I'm Yours\\" and its massive, yet stifling, success, \\"...Four Letter Word\\" is certainly a winner if not an outright triumph, and that is principally owed to the willingness Mraz has to try new sonic palettes, reevaluate past declarations and mix moods, tempos and themes more flagrantly than on his past three albums. For every instance in which he can be accused of playing it safe, he can just as easily be praised for taking a corresponding risk.<br /><br />\\"Who's Thinking About You Now?\\" is exemplary with its stark, warm instrumental arrangement and non-melodramatic, often almost-spoken brooding, as is the sparkly, curious \\"Frank D. Fixer,\\" an upbeat ode to Mraz's late grandfather which heads in an interesting direction, achieving universality and a charming lack of pretense, perfectly showcasing that full-bodied, sun-drenched vocal presence.<br /><br />\\"5/6\\" resembles earlier Mraz tunes with its idiosyncratic, unorthodox amount of verses and wordplay, his voice scaling a large range as he dispenses poetic droplets of Thoreau-like philosophy, at one point atop a swelling organ. It is a true pleasure and the album's best moment, although the tearfully moving \\"93 Million Miles\\" comes in on its heels with lyrics of profound love and compassion. Elsewhere, \\"The World as I See It,\\" in spite of a trite phrase or two, is intoxicating as it is atmospheric.<br /><br />While Mraz may not be perfectly framed on \\"Love is a Four Letter Word\\" - some of Joe Chiccarelli's production is a bit on the intrusive side, and a portion of his eccentricities, such as his delightful penchant for rap-singing, have been left on the cutting room floor - it is an album that affirms not only the humanity of the listener but also Mraz himself. It proves that, even when a slight sense of struggle slips in to the proceedings, he is unstoppably compelling and always intriguing, sometimes even more so as result.

She was amazing then (with Bruce Hornsby on the bill as well) and this album continues the tradition.  From the first track, the \\"got to listen to that again\\" \\"Used To Rule The World,\\" into the remake of \\"Right Down The Line\\" and on to the end, there's not a clinker in the bunch.

0399159029|4.0|In 1941, Berlin police detective Bernie Gunther flirts with suicide as a way out of his wretched life. He loathes Nazi Germany, but has orders to serve and protect the Reich, and feels like an imposter, a blur of who he was before the crimes that he was commanded to execute in Belorussia. Nazi newspapers trumpet their clarion call that \\"the Jews are our misfortune,\\" while Germany struggles to maintain their strength against the advancing Russian army.<br /><br />Berlin is barely recognizable, with everything in short supply-- watery coffee; minted chalk for toothpaste; powdered milk like sawdust; tiny shards of soap--\\"even the prettiest girl smelled like a stevedore\\"--and worst of all, brackish, sour, ersatz beer. You couldn't even get drunk to escape the pain. Moreover, the streets have eyes and the walls have ears; incautious words and ambiguous acts could get you in serious trouble, or dead.<br /><br />Bernie Gunther is called up to Prague to serve as bodyguard to Reinhard Heydrich, Reichsprotector and head of the SS. He despises and fears him, but there is no choice but to abide. He is in the middle of investigating the death of a foreign railway worker in Berlin when he leaves. He is also falling for a beautiful woman, Arianne, whose life he saved from a perp who may be connected to the railway worker's death. She is as inscrutable as Gunther, and thereby irresistible. He invites her to go to Prague with him, and he discreetly plants her at a hotel suite.<br /><br />At Heydrich's country house, he is surrounded by the Reich's most abhorrent officials, including four of Heydrich's adjutants. A cocktail party serves up more than expected, and compels Bernie into a dicey assignment (no spoilers, so I am being circumspect). This is where the hardboiled style and wit are curtailed. Gunther has been given carte blanche to interrogate the lives and ask no-holes-barred questions of these top officials. A surfeit of details in Gunther's investigation at the country house occasionally reads like the filling in of dossiers, and becomes too self-aware and studied. The limited movement of the country house setting adds to the officiousness of it all. The noir-like atmosphere dissipates as the narrative style changes; the pace becomes uneven, sluggish at times, and loses its edge.<br /><br />The most enigmatic character, Arianne, shrinks from a spicy, intriguing character into a stock set piece for two-thirds of the novel. However, Kerr delivers up a cogent denouement, harking back to the hardboiled style once again and provoking a possible storyline for the next novel. I had begun to slouch in my chair, until the climax put me right back on the edge.<br /><br />This is my first Kerr novel, but I am interested in pursuing more of the Bernie Gunther series, especially the first three books, which were well received. Apparently, the Gunther series is not written in chronological order, as the last book, [[ASIN:B005M483LC Field Gray]], took place in the 1950's.e occasionally reads like the filling in of dossiers, and becomes too self-aware and studied.

It took me longer to warm up to it than it did with their first album, but after a few listens I'd easily say it's at least on par with the first, which was excellent in its own right.

0312611692|4.0|Engagingly written and necessarily \\"all over the map,\\" Ian Morris provides an accessible survey of what in lesser hands could have been too much information. I love history, facts, cultures crammed into such one-volume tomes, but less captivated readers may find themselves in a plethora of Qin, Hurrian, Hilly Flanks, Bactrians--and that's one-third of the way in. Yet, maps and charts (one titled \\"the dullest diagram in history\\" to document Morris' key plotting of Eastern vs. Western social development on a point scale) do aid the less geographically and archeologically adept follower. His prose carries the heavy lifting of so much data into a comparatively compact space. Even at nearly 650 pages of text, the book balances necessary depth with narrative awareness of how much a reader can comprehend.<br /><br />For instance, to take three examples from a pivotal portion on the Axial Age: Morris sums up its progress while returning to the post-Ice Age motivator behind this era. \\"Lazy, greedy, and frightened people found easier, more profitable, and safer ways to do things, in the process building stronger states, trading farther afield, and settling in greater cities.\\" (263) He stresses how top-down \\"high-end\\" state systems centralize power, and use bureaucracies to run taxation gathering to generate income for a military force who enforces its collection. Lots goes out in revenue, but more comes in, so \\"the rulers and their employees live off the difference.\\" More pithily, in China: \\"Lords built icehouses in their palaces; peasants slid into debt.\\" (251) Lessons to be learned--as well as don't wipe out buffer states-- as fiercer invaders will likely take down the imperial center of power. Expansion of markets and territory, of course, impels this whole upward spiral that his charts follow over thousands of years.<br /><br />I was mildly surprised that Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" theories did not gain wider analysis. While Morris challenges both \\"long-term lock-in\\" theories (similar to Diamond) and \\"short-term accident\\" explanations for Western dominance on pp. 17-18, I was left unsure how Morris improved or challenged Diamond, other than calling the ancient core the \\"Hilly Flanks\\" and not the \\"Fertile Crescent.\\" East and West themselves shift, but a strength of this work is that Morris accounts for why Qin China and the Roman Empire succeeded-- and then due to geography and noble bickering became unable to control the frontiers of its vast territory. Migrations, climate change, plagues, and famine take center stage.<br /><br />He also attends minutely to weather patterns and how this factor accounts for many periods of stagnation or expansion. \\"Energy capture\\" is a novel way to explain why cultures take off and soar as they harness their resources and labor potential. Morris may be criticized for not adhering to historiographical models of leaders or ideas, but as an archeologist, it's expected that he examines the material record and he reminds us early on of this tricky interpretation. Flowers left on a Shanidar grave in today's Iraq may have been brought into the burrow by rats; a puppy buried within the embrace of an elderly woman 11,000 BCE at 'Ain Mallaha may not have been placed there \\"as if asleep\\" so conveniently!<br /><br />Where this balance of facts and research shifts is in spot-checking for sources. For instance, take those Bactrians. I found one source for them cited in the end notes, but that was all, and this section was embedded into a much larger chunk of the chapter at hand, with seemingly few references for a considerable narrative stretch. There appeared a tremendous amount of secondary scholarship examined by Morris. To his credit, yet not all of that was \\"common knowledge.\\" It's not always easy to track back to the works cited to hunt down facts or data in the narrative. A casual style of giving a key phrase from a page and a citation at text's end is fine, but often Morris makes leaps over what he has compacted down into such a small block of a chapter, so it's hard to \\"unpack\\" this scholarship if you wish to track down the primary research.<br /><br />Yet, any single volume designed to reach out to wider audiences than a monograph or university press tome will get hit with flak. I'd urge an open-minded reader to come to Morris' endeavor with a lively mind and lots of patience. One's curiosity will be rewarded, and one's mind stimulated. Those who enjoy playing games of conquest or watching multi-season series of imaginary realms hacking and scheming should find this real-life predecessor as worthwhile, for it, after all, is our story.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this book as I teach a class in \\"Technology, Culture and Society\\" that looks at Diamond and Ray Kurzweil's \\"singularity.\\" Morris plays Kurzweil's optimism off of Isaac Asimov's story \\"Nightfall\\" well. As with those thinkers, critics will have plenty to carp about in anyone trying to present thousands of complex ideas and findings within a few hundred pages for a wider readership. As with such books, this one-size-fits-nearly-all ambition is both admirable and perhaps doomed to its own minor shortcomings. Still, I recommend Morris' book for its verve and energy, and it will enrich the hours you invest in its unfolding of our own story, told yet again in epic fashion. One wonders if we will last, as a civilization, long enough to see the projected Eastern regaining of the lead over the West in 2103.hat he has compacted down into such a small block of a chapter, so it's hard to \\"unpack\\" this scholarship if you wish to track down the primary research.<br /><br />Yet, any single volume designed to reach out to wider audiences than a monograph or university press tome will get hit with flak.

As with such books, this one-size-fits-nearly-all ambition is both admirable and perhaps doomed to its own minor shortcomings. Still, I recommend Morris' book for its verve and energy, and it will enrich the hours you invest in its unfolding of our own story, told yet again in epic fashion. One wonders if we will last, as a civilization, long enough to see the projected Eastern regaining of the lead over the West in 2103.
B003Y5H5AQ|5.0|It does have Traditional Chinese in subtitle, to me that is great. Sveral blu-disk I bought and played with it but I still love it. I just can't share with my family. Now I can.
0345803485|1.0|Have only read the downloaded sample from my kindle so bypass this if that's a disqualifier.  Heard about the series this morning during a blaring morning news show in a doctor's office.  Sold HOW many?  Well, guess I oughta look.  What it resembles is the National Lampoon's 'Nightlight' parody of Twilight, which I'm sure has been mentioned before.  This is the silliest thing ...  Not silliest I've ever read, but silliest to sell so many copies.  Enjoy fans!

0060920084|1.0|Appropriate sub-title: 'hemorrhoidal old man, stuck on non-stop Greyhound bus with a broken toilet, shares his view of small-town America as he rides cross-country.'<br /><br />I'm actually surprised that the publisher sub-titled this \\"Travels in Small Town America\\", since the author rarely gets out of his car and actually talks to anyone in the small towns he travels through. It seems he's too busy disparaging the towns as he drives by to offer any real insight into the people who've created lives there.<br /><br />I've had the pleasure of driving across America several times in my life and never cease to be impressed with its beauty and the kindness of the people you find in its small towns. That kindness is one of the things I love most about living in my adopted small town in Colorado. Mr. Bryson's book is so lacking in detail and authenticity, one wonders if he ever got out of the car, or just sat in the back seat reading the latest issue of The New Yorker.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|when your playing the game you don't have a way to go back to your menu I hope they fix it and update it.
B003O86FMW|1.0|Seeing the title, I bought this book.  I was looking for information on bonfires since I try to have one at my farm every so often.  I was hoping to find some designs or ideas on creating some cool bonfires but I was really disappointed.  I didn't find any useful information on fires in this book.  Plus it has some strange reference to a game that I only guess must be played around dinner time.  Those sound strangely like some games we used to play while waiting for dinner to be served when I was a child.  But again, it didn't really describe the games either so it is really hard to judge the book.  I rate it low since the title and descriptions are mis-leading.  But if you figure it out, some of those pre-dinner games might be fun!

145470246X|5.0|I pre-ordered this book months ago and have been anxiously awaiting its release -- and it does not disappoint!  Out of the thirty projects included, I want to make every single piece -- they are that beautiful!<br /><br />The book is divided up into several chapters:<br /><br />--Chapter 1:  Supplies and Techniques<br />--Chapter 2:  Embellished Bases -- includes one necklace, one earring, and five bracelet designs<br />--Chapter 3:  Bezeled Stones -- includes one necklace, two chokers, two bracelets, two earrings, and three pendant designs<br />--Chapter 4:  A Question of Architecture -- includes three earrings, one necklace, two pendant, and one bangle design<br />--Chapter 5:  Pearl Centers -- includes three necklaces, one brooch, one earrings, and one bracelet design<br />--Chapter 6:  Sabination Nation -- a chapter on how Sabine designs her projects<br />--Gallery -- beautiful photos of designs by other beaders<br />--Author Gallery -- photos of designs by Lippert<br /><br />As you can tell from the above breakdown, there is a really nice mix of projects included.  Some are more complex than others, and the header for each project gives a rough idea of how simple or hard each one might be. Lippert mostly uses variations of RAW with an overlay of netting, but she also includes an overview of peyote and a few other stitches in the Techniques chapter.<br /><br />As with previous books in the Lark Master Class series, the instructions are also excellent, as are the diagrams.  I've done one of Lippert's projects before and found her instructions to be clear and easy to follow, and this book follows suit.  Each project also includes a clearly labeled supply list, and the finished size of the piece.  While the actual color number of the seed beads isn't given, it should be easy to figure out a similar bead color to use to match the suggested colorways.  With the Swarvoski crystals and firepolished beads used, the color is given in a general way.  (For instance, the supply list will state something like \\"30 golden-orange crystal bicones, 4 mm.\\")<br /><br />I also love the hardback format of these Lark books; they are so much easier to bead from than softback books, which always seem to flop around on me.<br /><br />Overall, this is a lovely book to add to your beading library!  The only problem for me is that I love all of the projects so much, I don't know which one I want to start with!  ;-)pply list will state something like \\"30 golden-orange crystal bicones, 4 mm.\\")<br /><br />I also love the hardback format of these Lark books; they are so much easier to bead from than softback books, which always seem to flop around on me.<br /><br />Overall, this is a lovely book to add to your beading library!

030788743X|4.0|I was intrigued by Cline's vision of the future - a world where our escape (complete and total escape) is into a video game where we can completely recreate who we are. People in 2044 live and work in the OASIS and for some (like Wade) it IS their world, especially considering the turmoil the world itself is in. It's very art intimating life, in a way.<br /><br />I think I would have enjoyed it more had I lived in the 1980s (and understood the more obscure references) and not been born in 1987 (allowing me to only catch the big/well-known ones). Also, Cline would lose me when he went into extreme detail about the technology of they day. Necessary since we have no idea what these machines do, but after a while, it got tedious. However, these two things were not big enough issues for me to stop reading.<br /><br />I really got caught up in Wade's attempt to beat the evil corporation (IOI) and find Halliday's egg and gain is fortune in effort to keep OASIS from commercialized. IOI is one of those true evil corporations that will stop at nothing to get what they want, which include murder. I really like the other characters and their interactions with one another, even if we only knew them through their avatars in the OASIS - up until the climax of the novel anyway.<br /><br />In the end, this is a highly entertaining book, especially if you get 80s pop culture. One of the best aspects is that you do NOT have to be a gamer to appreciate the adventure and storytelling.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|it is a terrible game, not like the old school Oregon Trail we all knew and loved. I would not get it.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|I have had this cover for about 3 weeks now. I bought it for my Kindle Fire which I use all day,every day. Had to write a review for this since I love it but there is a lot of negativity about it here. It comes with an insert that has a magnet to keep it closed while in the packaging but you are supposed to remove that when you put in your device..so no, the one I received does not have a magnetic closure nor does it list one in the description. Yes the elastic straps are snug but I feel like they do a wonderful job of keeping the kindle where it belongs (in the case and not on the floor) since my kids like to play with it. If they ever do happen to break in the future which I don't see happening, so be it..I will probably want a new case in a few years anyways,maybe with a different design on the outside since I am always changing my style. My case closes all the way,but I do wrap a hair band around it while I am out and it is in my purse so that nothing can get inside and scratch it. I then thought about how some said that it will not close all the way ever..Maybe flip the case over so the kindle is on the top side ,then the weight of it will always keep it closed. It feels great in my hand,the cover is gorgeous, and the inside is a nice smooth microsuede/fiber type material with a pocket for papers or what not. There is enough room when I close it that I can even place my small stylus pen inside on the spine of the cover when closed so I don't lose it.I have had quite a few people compliment it and ask me where I got it. I am glad I purchased this case and would do it again. It does the job I need it to and looks good at the same time.
B0061S0A64|5.0|Easy way to make music! I couldn't help but try and see how many nodes I could add until the app crashed. Unfortunately I lost count as everything turned a blur of colors and sounds. I satisfied myself as my input stopped being registered and my phone gave up and quit the app. Though you'd think they'd limit the amount of nodes you could have on screen at once. Or at least let you specify an amount. Still all good fun. Try it for yourself!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If there's one rule in the silo: never ask to go outside.<br /><br />Now you're probably wondering, what's outside, right? And also, who the hell is Hugh Howey? This is good; this is normal, these are good questions. Let's begin by answering the last question first. Howey is many things: an ex-yacht captain, a master story-teller and probably, the internet's best kept secret. But WOOL isn't Howey's first book, and book might not be the right word, since WOOL is actually Howey's second series. He's self-published (for the most part) and this, quite possibly, is what makes WOOL so brilliant. With no publisher, no advertising whatsoever, no budget and no famous-author blurbs, Howey managed to single-handedly create his most successful (and one of Amazon's best-selling Kindle sci-fi) series to date.<br /><br />Briefly, WOOL is one of the best science fiction books I have ever read. And it's actually addicting! The formula? Howey never (ever) offers straight-up explanations to anything, even to the most important questions like: what is outside, how did the world blow up, did the world blow up and why are these people all living underground in a silo? Howey takes his time--almost like he is flaunting his ability to tell a damn good story--and lets the book do all the work, through meticulous character development and engaging dialogue.<br /><br />But to answer the first question: WOOL is an unorthodox tale about survival and post-apocalyptic wellness in a dystopian world where reality and the very notion of survival have devolved into a state of underground existence. In principle, it's definitely a science fiction text but don't fret--Howey abstains from using age-old science fiction clich&eacute;s or boring us with already-been-done end-of-the-world scenarios. And don't expect this to be a tale about aliens from distant planets with shrink rays from the future; there's nothing about time-travel here. The world of WOOL is anchored in a reality that seems much too real and plausible.<br /><br />The exposition is rather speedy: something bad happened and the outside is no longer safe. All survivors now live underground. And again, forget clich&eacute;s, these people don't live in giant vaults or covered bunkers; they live in one giant silo but there's more to it... On the first level of the silo (the top,) there are these giant wallscreens connected to cameras that are mounted to the exterior wall of the silo and these cameras allow the inhabitants to see the outside, which really isn't that much. On the wallscreens, it's the same loop: a brown desert and hills with a gray sky. Pretty straightforward, see, but note that these wallscreens are central to the entire WOOL universe. The world went to crap a long time ago and these people have been living in a silo for quite some time--several decades it seems--so after a while, a (somewhat unique) justice system, contingent of the wallscreens and outside cameras, was created. If you ask to go outside, you are considered a traitor and are treated like a criminal and criminals are punished by being sent outside, for \\"cleaning.\\"<br /><br />In one of the early chapters--and these chapters go by fast, the longest being something like six or seven pages--Howey goes into great detail about the outside, basically affirming that what the inhabitants see on the wallscreens is indeed real. The outside is nothing but desert. Obviously, an environment like this is terrible for cameras, as bits of sand, dust and grime quickly collect onto the surface lenses. This is why someone is required to clean, routinely. And if there is no one to send outside, the sheriff chooses one of the inhabitants for cleaning. Pretty sick, right? Oh, and also, no one has ever refused to clean.<br /><br />If anything, WOOL is like a (very) good soap-opera that reads like a mystery novel (at times) with obvious elements of science fiction and the occasional (spectacularly-written) action sequence. Each chapter (generally) leaves the reader in a daze, with a mini-cliffhanger, the sort you would come to expect from a serialized novel like WOOL, and this, actually, is what makes WOOL so addicting and ultimately, so satisfying. Oh, and did I mention? WOOL features one of the most-accomplished and satisfying villains in recent years. The kind who does the obligatory explanation-of-dastardly-plans speech but then actually goes through with the plan!<br /><br />Go read the Amazon reviews; WOOL has the sort of characters and chapter endings that will leave you lying awake at night, wondering: my goodness, what could possibly be next? How is this character ever going to overcome this great torment? It's a drama, a thriller, a mystery, a science fiction text. It's WOOL, and I promise: it will infect your life.aves the reader in a daze, with a mini-cliffhanger, the sort you would come to expect from a serialized novel like WOOL, and this, actually, is what makes WOOL so addicting and ultimately, so satisfying.

B000683VI4|5.0|When I first heard of this movie I thought it would suck. But then my best friend let me borrow it and I fell in love with it. It shows how much you learn and grow in the arms of someone you love. It also shows that if your love is real then that person no matter how far they travel will return back into your arms.
0439023513|3.0|I read each of these books and really enjoyed the first and second ones. In fact I couldn't put them down. This 3rd one, not so much. It was decent, and probably more realistic to the ways of war, but it was much harder to follow and too many characters wihout character development. I don't mind how it ended. I'm good with that part. I just think this book wasn't the best for the end of any series, much less this one. Like others have said, it just felt rushed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can i say I am a hopeless romantic with a thirst for Darkness. This book held me still . and longing for more.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This was my first encounter with a book that takes place in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world. Normally, I would have read the book jacket and bypassed it. But I gave it a try at my husband's reconmendation and I'm so glad I did! This trilogy features a huge cast of memorable and well-developed characters who all experience very relatable emotions in the face of fantastic conflict. It was incredibly easy to get lost in the world presented by Collins and I'm sad to see it end.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|it worked on kindle fire. I wish u didn't need real money on lots of extras but it was still fun.
B006X415GK|5.0|SO glad I got one while they were still sold by amazon! They wouldnt allow me to buy 4 like I wanted for me, my daughter, and my 2 nieces. I was about to see if I could on a new order but the 30 minutes it took me to decide to try was all it took for them to be sold out :( Anyway I got it yesterday and she is cute. Her hair is stiff but if I give her to my daughter I could easily scrunch it loose. The velcro isnt the best though, the cover up and swimsuit closures keep coming off but not too big of a deal since I just look at it and if I give to my kid she will be half naked shortly anyway. For 4$ I expected some quality differences and being that the regular priced dolls have horrible limbs I expected this one to really suck but to my surprise she seems more durable than all the other mh dolls my daughter has hoping that means that the newer dolls are of similar quality. Her legs do seem harder to bend I tried and stopped before bending it all the way but again right now we just look at her so she isnt dancing with the others yet plus she was 4$ so I wouldnt care about that much anyway.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was an awful book. Why did this book become such a phenomenon when it's about a woman's willing submission to satisfy a man's need to cause pain? \\"I don't want you to hit me tonight,\\" she says. I can't imagine why any woman would need to indicate which nights she'd like a beating. Mom taught me that the first time a guy hit me was the last, as I'd be out the door. I'm concerned for women in this country. How can so many of us support this book's endorsement of male dominance?  Women have fought a mighty battle to attain rights and equality in a male oriented society; this book's popularity makes concerned about the direction we're taking.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|So Logitech recently had a sale and I had been eyeing the G13 for almost a year but was on the fence as far as how much it would really do for me. On sale, it was the same price as the Nostromo and I am a huge Razer fan and can't live without my Naga and Vespula. That said, I have always only used Logitech keyboards and headsets and I love them just as much. This truly was a difficult decision for me and I pored over the reviews of both for days.<br /><br />I'm so happy with the choice I made. I can't speak to the Nostromo as I haven't used one, but I can't imagine life being any better than it is with my G13 right now. Let me say straight out, this is not as valuable for non-MMO type games which require a ridiculous number of hotkeys to perform at your best. Games like Skyrim where you're basically just moving around with WASD and attacking with two buttons will not see the huge improvements that your MMOs will experience, but it's still a very nice upgrade in terms of comfort, especially for laptop users. The G13 will serve you well in any game that requires the keyboard because it allows your wrist and arm to be in a more natural position. I can completely relax my arm rather than have to try to hover over the keyboard for long gaming sessions. I have found that the G13 works amazingly well even when not on a flat surface. I regularly play in bed on my laptop and I usually rest the base of the G13 against my thigh so that it's at an angle to the bed (if that makes sense!) and this is surprisingly awesome. I have no loss in control over playing on a flat surface and my arm can be completely relaxed at my side the entire time. It's easily tied for the best accessory you can buy for your gaming laptop, equaled only by [[ASIN:B002MPPRPO Razer Naga MMOG Laser Gaming Mouse]]. Paired with a [[ASIN:B007BD0VV2 Razer Vespula Dual-Sided Gaming Mouse Mat]] you will only have to touch your keyboard if you use text to chat. If you use voice chat over Ventrilo or Teamspeak, your keyboard will be collecting dust from lack of use. What I love about this setup is the ability to have both of my hands at my sides when I'm using my gaming laptop and I'm supremely comfortable. Mobile gaming is the future and I want to be able to take my games with me and be comfortable wherever I play while still being as effective as possible. The G13 is a huge part of what makes this possible.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, I also love my G13 with my desktop PC. The profiles are stored on the gameboard so I can easily move it from computer to computer with no issue. It works great on a desk being nicely weighted and with a good grip on the base. It doesn't slip or give without excessive force (and no one games THAT hard!). The design is also perfect. I was truly concerned because I have smaller hands and that is actually a big factor behind this purchase. With smaller hands, it's hard to reach across a keyboard to hit all those hotkeys. I read a lot of reviews claiming the G13 is not kind to small hands but I have not found that to be the case. With my palm resting comfortably on the designated rest, I can easily reach the top row of keys. The furthest on the left and right are a bit of a stretch for constant use but I find G1 in the upper left is perfect for TAB and targeting mobs. The one just below is nice for SPACE or jump. I use the top five center keys for 1-5 and the five directly below for 6-10. I have no trouble accessing any of them at any time and I adjusted to the new positions really quickly, faster than I learned to use my Razer Naga by far. I mapped the keys near the joystick to M and L for map and quest log. And of course, the joystick has completely replaced my WASD keys for movement. Moving with a joystick is so natural, especially for console gamers, even casual ones like myself. I have none of the issues others have mentioned about it hurting their thumbs or being hard to push. A very gentle push is all that's needed to continuously move forward. Diagonals are possible also. I tend to hold forward on the joystick and mouse steer because that's what I'm used to, but I find myself turning with the joystick more and more and it works great. Now my fingers are completely free to access my primary hotkeys rather than trying to contort my hand to reach WASD keys and hotkeys simultaneously. I have my secondary hotkeys assigned to my Razer Naga and I'm good to go with split second response time thanks to all keys being within my natural reach without straining.<br /><br />The best tip I can give new users who are having trouble accessing keys is to remap them manually for each game that you play. It really only takes a few minutes to do and once it's done, you don't have to worry about it again. By default, WoW's map is set up so that the center keys on the gameboard are assigned to WASD. This made no sense to me because I wanted to get away from using my fingers for movement and do it all with my thumb on the joystick. The key profiling software is very user friendly and easy to understand without ever looking at the manual. You just click the G key you want to change in the interface, and then press the key you want it to be. Easy. I remapped all my keys so that they would work for ME. I appreciate all the effort Logitech put into pre-designing key layouts for so many games, but ultimately what's going to work best for you is a layout you choose yourself. Pick keys that are easy to reach (which should be most of them, even for small hands) for your primary abilities and use the ones that are a bit of a stretch (if any) to lesser used functions, like map, bag and quest log. I've seen so many reviews where people complain that the keys aren't in the right place. Change them!<br /><br />My only regret is that I didn't buy one sooner. The G13 has changed my gaming for the better, and with kids, school and work, I want the most out of my game time, and now I have it. Thank you once again, Logitech!e forward.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Whew!  This one was a scorcher.  Fifty is every girls dream without the damage, which he is handling better and better throughout this book.  IMHO he is the best written male character in romance that I've ever read.  Brilliant, honorable, warm-hearted, solicitous, sarcastic, thoughtful, protective and hotter than a scorpian on a grill in bed - not to mention totally gorgeous and never uber-macho.  What more could a girl ask for?  Oh yeah, he's stinking rich as frosting on the cake.  Fifty and Ana are incredible together.<br /><br />So many people have written reviews concerning the plot that I think I'll pass.  This is book 2 in a 3 book series, and you can't go wrong here.  The BSDM is treated with kid gloves compared to other novels and the sex scenes sizzle so much I thought my Kindle was going to start smoking.  It doesn't get much hotter then this.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who loves modern day romance.  You will absolutely love it!

B00785P2QC|4.0|Don't make people pay for the full version. it's STUIPID!!!! The game is fun though. I just don't want to spend any money.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Downloaded this game as the free app of the day for.my Amazon Kindle Fire. It plays very well on here and is a great time killer, whether you have just a few minutes or hours. The puzzles get harder with each level, challenging you to figure out how to play the<br />maze.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|When I first started playing...the game sad awesome. Now you have to wait days to be able to advance in money,  crops,  or animals. All and all the game just wants you to spend your regular cash to advance in the game...not worth your time.
0439023491|4.0|I am a little disappointed in this one mostly because I thought they had finished the games and wouldn't return so soon to them. I thought things would have been more political.  Going back to the games seemed like a safe move because she had already been there and we already know how the games were played.<br /><br />I did find this book moved faster than the first book.  Even though I didn't like going back to the games it did seem like they were barely there.  The ending is interesting and I hope that the third book will bring more flare.
B0052OZJQO|5.0|The music on this CD is from the sound track of the great dance movie \\"Pina\\". [[ASIN:B0052OZJQO Pina  - O.S.T.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I use to love the Oregon trail fame. with this app you can do very little before you run out of energy which you either have to purchase more or wait. you should be able to just play the game. I will uninstall.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I downloaded this for the kids but ive taken over! I play this every time I get a free moment
B0055SWM08|3.0|its kind of boring... wait, SUPER BORING. i got it because everybody suggested it but i got it and i was bored to DEATH. although it works great on kindles and is a good game for riddlers!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|As a long-time fan of George R. R. Martin's epic book series, I was immediately skeptical when HBO announced that they were going to adapt the saga for television viewers; I had been reading ASoIaF for the past tens years now (started when I was 13) and was aware of the liberty some adaptations take from its source. But since HBO has had a history of producing excellent, ground-breaking shows, I watched the first episode the day it aired and was immediately blown away. Let me tell you why.<br /><br />Stunning visualization: I love that HBO was able to capture the medieval, historic feel of Game of Thrones.<br />Despite being a fantasy series, Martin loosely based A Song of Ice and Fire on the War of the Roses, England's civil war in the late 1400s. Filming locations were fantastic, and HBO did not shy away from the gritty, sexual, and violent nature of the books. It stays faithful to the blend of realism and fantasy that earned ASoIaF its legions of adoring fans. Everything from the sets, the costumes, the weapons, etc. are dazzling.<br /><br />Casting: Aces to David Benioff, Dan Weiss, and the casting team at HBO for gathering a talented, well-suited cast, especially for gems like: Peter Dinklage (whose Emmy and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor was well-deserved), Jason Momoa, Sean Bean, Lena Headey, Maisie Williams, Kit Harington, and Emilia Clarke. Special mention for Jack Gleeson, who is exceptionally and hatefully evil in his role as psychopathic prince/King Joffrey. I can wax poetic about Peter Dinklage's impeccable Tyrion Lannister all day, and recently, Gwendolyn Christie has surprised me as Brienne of Tarth in Season 2. As a huge fan and an ASoIaF nerd, I am also pleased that the producers have acknowledged that it was, in part, due to fan suggestions that certain actors were cast.<br /><br />Staying true to the books: The big reason I was skeptical of the show at first was the tendency of writers and producers to take liberties with some of the plotsand characters, but the TV series has stayed true to the novels so far. I also applaud HBO for bringing in and consulting George R. R. Martin himself in creating the series. Martin is never one to be predictable, as fans know, and his ability to create a fantastic plot with so many gray characters, all masterfully wrapped up in such politically intriguing schemes is nothing short of genius.<br /><br />Music: White Noise Lab's rock version of Game of Throne's opening theme has been playing on loop on my iPod. Just sayin'.<br /><br />Finally, Game of Thrones is an raw, sophisticated, and intelligently done show that compels you to read the books. I have friends who love the TV series and are devouring the books even as I type this review. For a TV show to compel its audience to READ is something that I find absolutely inspirational. As emotionally invested as I am in the books, I find myself looking forward to HBO every Sunday with the same eagerness. For a college senior, it's a great time to just forget about classes, toss back a cold one, and enjoy something I'm passionate about coming alive onscreen. HBO has gone above and beyond my expectations, and *SPOILERS*, the first couple episodes of Season 2 (A Clash of Kings) continue to impress.
B0053Q9DQI|4.0|Although the blu-ray for Jane Eyre was packaged well and arrived undamaged, it was never-the-less a disappointment. The front cover shown on Amazon is NOT the cover you receive. You will be greeted by a cover that is rather drab and lackluster. No feeling of romance or adventure. If I didn't love this version of the movie so much, I would return it based solely on this uninviting cover, hence, the 4 stars. Amazon, you need to review the truth in advertising so more diehards of Jane Eyre are not disappointed this way.
0307592731|2.0|Reading this book was like taking to the trail with Cheryl Strayed. I could \\"see\\" the beautiful mountain-top vistas right along with her and feel the blisters on my feet as she trod the exhaustive trails. HOWEVER, I found her casual,sexually promiscuous attitudes and behavior, and also the obscene language in the book very distracting from the storyline.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Let me start by saying that I was a diehard Format fan and have always enjoyed anything that Nate is involved in. In AZ, it was always a mystery how our great local band did not blow up much bigger than they did. When I heard Nate had a new band with Fun I was very excited. This album is everything I expected from them. It's catchy, ambitious, a little eccentric and just very well written. That being said, I gave it 4 stars for one reason, the auto-tune. Why they chose to use it is beyond me. It ruins great songs and distorts Nate's great voice. People use auto-tune when they have bad voices. I wish they would put out a non auto-tune version of these songs that use it. All in all it's a must have for any Format/Nate fans. Cheers!
B007IQX1G4|4.0|I enjoyed this movie but it was pretty depressing and not as good as I expected it to be.  Overall it was well acted and believable.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I definitely have been very excited and enjoyed Angry Birds since the first one came out several years ago. It has been one of the most popular games to play on the go, because it feels timeless and just simply fun. For the latest installment Angry Birds Space, it is a bit more challenging trying to launch the fun and furious birds into space against the furious but loveable pigs who have stolen their eggs and trying to smash their plans. The game definitely is fun and exciting from beginning to end, and another classic addition to the Angry Birds franchise that just seems to keep on getting bigger and bigger with time. They say no one in space can her you, but in this case you can be heard screaming for the high score.<br /><br />Graphics: B<br /><br />Sound: B+<br /><br />Control: B<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+<br /><br />Overall: B
0345803485|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey: What a sweet, yet disturbing love story!  I can not wait to read Ms. James' next book!<br /><br />Susan Kelley, author [[ASIN:B003FMUWH6 Ghostly Encounters of the Paranormal Kind]]
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game!!! almost as good as the games on fb! love the whole story line and the characters of the game!
1455508977|4.0|What a truly sweet story!  Not only believable, but plausible!  I loved the book and can't wait to see the movie!  Nicholas Sparks rocks!<br /><br />Susan Kelley, author [[ASIN:0557372771 Ghostly Encounters of the Paranormal Kind]]
B0000714BP|5.0|for some really good laughs!! Wesley Snipes is a scream as \\"Noxema\\" as was John Leguizamo as \\"Chi-Chi.\\" I love this movie, it was a \\"must have\\" in my DVD collection.  I would definitely recommend!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really love this game because I play whatever I want. I. would never hats this game because is the better of all the games
B0011NVC9I|4.0|I saw this on cable once and had to have it. Really a great movie and I'm a fan of Ray Winstone (loved him in King Arthur). . so I had to purchase this story of the warrior Beowulf must fight and defeat the monster Grendel who is terrorizing towns, and later, Grendel's mother, who begins killing out of revenge.  Great cast too Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Robin Wright. I would definitely recommend this. . Glad I have this in my collection. . hmmm I think I'll watch it tonight!
B006YTTVHO|1.0|Why does it show that it's Free but when you go to download it's NOT, not good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Not a good idea to get people interested in dealing with Amazon
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|While i liked this book well enough, it moved a little slow in some parts and the ending annoyed me to no end. Personally, I don't think any book should leave a reader hanging like that unless the sequel is available, or at least due out within a few weeks.<br /><br />That said, some of the \\"powers\\" and magic was interesting and I loved the house that hides stuff. I didn't get into the romance as much as I'd like. I'm not sure why but \\"heat\\" wasn't there for me. I'll probably read the sequel when it comes out, but I won't pay full price for it. I'll hope it goes on sale during one of Amazon's famous promos.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I don't review apps. But this one is too good to ignore. Works great on droid x. Awesome app for anyone who likes sound. Would buy this if it wasn't free today. Only problem is<br /> putting it down!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Boy does this author know how to pluck your heart strings. Seriously, I think I cried for like an hour straight while reading this. It's sad, it's lovely. If all of Picoults novels are going to make me this emotional I will have to take a long break between them. I can't be walking around all puffy-eyed all the time!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Unique and interesting. I couldn't put it down once I started! The plot is intricate but well put together; the characters are slightly cliche (it is a Cinderella rip-off, after all) but believable and easy to relate to; the romance actually seems natural, which is hard to find in a lot of YA romance. I was thoroughly impressed and am eagerly awaiting the next installment.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|it's  quite fun. not very bad. though it's  quite hard to control (placing and clicking buildings).<br />linked to fb, but no friends show up. am i really the only one who play this game????
B007SGM084|5.0|You will find this book to be spellbinding....A must read, with the characters and the story line both being well developed. OMG so many times working with children abused and neglected, this story supported my thoughts on the road these children must  take if they are ever to be truly healed as adult...  An awesome story on unconditional love, family commitment, and a true desire to be whole....Very impressive for a first book from this Author, You Go Girl....I will be looking for more.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|i cant visit friend's village. it keeps asking me to relaunch the app and upgrade, even though it's already uptodate.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game - just started playing but it is a Lot of fun I like the variety. Good job.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|i love this show if you haven't watched it try it. watched the first season on netflix and had to order season 2 right away.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw a preview about this upcoming movie and decided to read the books before the movie came out. I purchased it through my Amazon account and downloaded the Kindle app on my Droid. I couldn't put it down (seriously I read at every possible moment including everytime I was walking anywhere.) I plowed through the first one within a week and quickly moved on to the second and then final book. Each book had its own merit and didn't leave you with the feeling like the one before was way better. I'm in my early thirties and felt that the books each had enough to interest a wide range of readers. Also, I have to add that I did end up seeing the movie (which was good) but that you gain so much more understanding and build a better relationship/empathy with the characters through reading the book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|LOVE LOVE THIS SERIES!!!  I THINK MATT BOMER WOULD MAKE A GREAT CHRISTIAN GREY IF THEY MAKE A MOVIE OF THIS SERIES!
1451673442|5.0|This is the most awesome book of the series. A book to live your life by. Rhonda has gone above and beyond with this one. As she says, May the joy be with you!
B007NR9WBG|4.0|I love this movie. Saw it years ago when it first came out.<br />I rented it on DVD recently. My review of 4 stars is for the movie itself, but i am waiting on making a purchase.<br /><br />I want someone to tell me their thoughts on the Blu-Ray version of this movie. Is it worthwhile? Did they do an excellent job? Or is a quick up-conversion transfer hatchet job?
0345803485|1.0|I was sure this book was self published  because the prose is so horrendous. I kept hearing that this book as - a must read... So I purchased with high, enthusiastic expectation. I started to read and with every page became morebaffled by the popularity. Everything about this book is terrible. Prose, story, character... The author could not write herself out of a paper bag. Redundant, cliche, and like other reviewers noted, not erotic. Our heroine is so immature it feels creepy and weird instead of hot and heavy.  I didn't finish and wish my 10 bucks back into my wallet.
B0073PZIYI|3.0|The idea was great but the acting was flat and the script was bad. It could have been great. JT had his moments that were awesome and the timekeeper was ok but Mr. Weiz was terrible. There should have been more violence, I would have loved it if quienten tarrentino did it, that would have been great. In the end, it was a decent movie, and like I said if they did it like smoking aces or Shoot 'em up it would have deserved 5 stars.
0345522478|2.0|I thought this book was totally boring and I, unfortunately, have bought the next two which I should never have done with an unknown (to me) author.<br /><br />Atticus runs around acting like someone just out of junior high and full of himself.  I liked the dog and the neighbor, but that was about it.  I couldn't find any substance in the book, it is just so trivial.
B0052U59F4|3.0|I was disapointed in the plot and the writing.  There was definately sex, but i just didn't feel good after reading this book.  Doubt I will read the next two int he series
B007R41E8O|1.0|Kept getting a white screen over game when i tapped on the next TUTORIAL...never even got to play! I unistalled....want money back!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like this game. its fun and cute.you CAN leave the game. just go to the options menu in the settings in the bottom right corner. no problems.
B0055SWM08|2.0|The user interface asthtetic is astounding, but the game itself is entirely simplistic for this level of effort. I really expected something more fascinating, especially since it's received such a disproportionally high number of 5 stars. Basically, everything but the game itself excites me, and if anything, it should be the other way around.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I rarely write reviews but had to comment.  I got this on FOTD and it's awesome!  Fun to play with and a great stress reliever and soother!  Try it!  Also very easy to use!
B0061S0A64|4.0|this app is lots of fun! very mesmerizing. I would recommend trying it. it's really different and interesting to use.
B0061S0A64|4.0|highly musical sound generation whether guided by the user or in auto. on my droidx the recordings are not saved, else I'd give 5 stars.
B007R41E8O|1.0|Download of Resources takes a very loooong time.  It's 350 MB.  The game won't open on my Viewsonic 7e tablet (Android OS).  Finally unistalled it. I wrote to Amazon.com asking for refund.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Have not had a chance to play this game. He did not download to my phone. So I never got the chance to play.
B005WFUZTE|4.0|Ill keep it short: as some have mentioned, very top notch album, probably the best in a while. i'm not a fan of the re-releases of old songs, such as millennium of the blind, albeit this one is quite different than the original. otherwise, the quality is good, the solos strong, the guitars as crunchy and metal as ever. keep it up dave!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great game for all ages. Love the fact that it is free and better than a lot of game you have to pay for. I would recommend this game.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This is a fun game on the kindle.  The controls are responsive.  The graphics are good.  It is one of the better free games.  It is just like mario brothers back in the day.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  Such a different kind of read. I highly recommend this book, and then tell your girlfriends to read it too! Not a book for kids or teens.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the second book too!! Simply amazing!!! Would definitely recommend to all my friends and co-workers too. A great late night read ;-)
0545265355|4.0|I bought this set for my eldest daughter and she couldn't have been more excited.  Susanne Collins vivid description of the settings and characters allowed my daughter to immerse in the books easily.  Talking about the books characters and the social issues that surround them has become our favorite new topic of conversation.  Excellent books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing! Captivating! Can't put it down!!! I haven't read a book in ages - bought this because of all the hype - and it did not disappoint. It was an AMAZING read! I couldn't put it down!!! Love it - ever single page!!! I'm off to buy the 2nd book now.
0345803485|1.0|I agree with everything the other one star reviewers stated...heard about this book on Today and thought it would be worth checking out.  I am a prolific reader and am all over the map with the common denominator of loving great writing,  I have a teen so I have read Twilight, Hunger Games etc as well as most classic fiction and current great reads.  This is simply trash and irritating from any kind of literary perspective.  A harlequin romance would be a pulitzer prize winner compared to this.<br />It is ridiculous that it has received this type of attention.  Again,  the graphic sex was boring and repetitive.  Could have been like a porn movie--no real plot just sex scene after sex scene.  And if I read \\"she whispered...I whispered\\" one more time...Just awful.
0307352145|4.0|Pros:<br />This is the third book I have read in the past couple of years on introversion. I am excited that it is a worthy subject for books. I am always interested to know more about how God has wired me as an introvert.<br /><br />I appreciated Susan Cain's use of well-known historical figures to make her points. Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, and Ghandi were all introverts and discussed in Cain's book.<br /><br />Cain addressed some large issues, such as environments in the workplace and school. America has an extrovert ideal, which I have seen not only written into job descriptions but also in the ways kids are forced to work together on almost every assignment.<br /><br />My favorite chapter was Chapter 10: The Communication Gap. I am convinced that if people understood introversion/extroversion better, they would have better relationships. \\"This was a painfully common dynamic... the introverts desperately craving downtime and understanding from their partners, the extrovery longing for company, and resentful that others seemed to benefit from their partners' 'best' selves\\" (228).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cain addressed the 2008 stockmarket crash, one of the only chapters I was not really interested in reading. Maybe it was that I did not have anything invested that it did not capture my attention as much as the rest of the book, but it made the middle section of the book drag on for me.<br /><br />I do not like it when authors constantly say \\"coming up in chapter xx\\", which Cain did quite a bit. Maybe it is my own personal displeasure, but I just want people to come out and say what they mean when they mean to say it.<br /><br />Overall:<br />If you don't want to read it all, at least read Chapter 10 and the Conclusion. But I do recommend it for everyone. It will be insightful for both introverts and extroverts.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book keeps you at the edge of your seat. However I may not have purchased if I would have known it was a sequel. Very disappointed - It does keep your attention throughtout - it was have gotten better review if it would have had a better ending of where they left off.
B0072QPV6I|2.0|Expected a bit more from this concert. Music is great and it technically looks great but my idea of watching a concert is to see the musicians playing, which admittedly these guys don't \\"play\\" much, it's more of a performance. But it's the way this was shot that didn't work for me. Interesting stage show except that their \\"instruments\\" are set up in the center of the stage, stacked about 12' high and they block about 1/3 of the image projected on the stage. So as great as the light/projection show is, you can't see it very well. Also many of the camera shots are from the audience POV, so you are trying to look through people's heads and arms. Dumb.<br />And you will see more reaction shots of the Japanese audience than you will of the Chemical Bros. Lame.<br />Overall the bluray of the concert was a big disappointment, especially after seeing really well shot and staged concerts like Porcupine Tree and David Gilmore. I don't get how anyone can give this a 5 star rating. I guess if you do enough dope, anything can look good.<br />Again, caveat emptor if you're not a huge fan.<br /><br />The music is great but the staging & shooting simply sucks.
B005PR44XC|5.0|Finally an economics text which not only explains how the world got into a financial crisis but does so in a readable thought provoking style unlike most other sleep inducing economic text.Highly recommended to anyone who has been affected by the crisis. Who hasn't? The author gains access to important players in the crisis who give surprising insight into their blunders with millions of dollars. Leaves you gobsmacked!

B0052U59F4|4.0|After hearing about this series on The Today Show, I was intrigued. It was an enjoyable escape from everyday life. I looked forward to having some time throughout my busy day to read this book. After reading the first one, I just had to get the second book.
140120841X|4.0|Beautiful art, great story line.  This is a classic dystopian tale.  Some aspects don't stand up to time very well, given that the story takes place in the late 1990s, in a post-nuclear world where Nazis have taken over Britain.  However, if you hang up your disbelief hat, and pretend it's an alternate universe, you can relax and go along for the ride.<br /><br />Did I say relax?  The story is tense, the world is dark, and the characters are terribly flawed.  The content is pretty hardcore, as one would expect when Nazis rule.  This story contains no gallant heroes in white armor, and as a close look at history tells us, such heroes may never exist.<br /><br />This book has inspired movements in the present day.  The Guy Fawkes mask has come to represent several modern anarchist-leaning, anti-corporate, anti-government movements, especially the hacktivist group, Anonymous, and as an influential branch of that, the less geeky Occupy movement.  While our present day is certainly not as suffocating as the England in V for Vendetta, there is still a lot of political oppression, and real people suffering and oppressed in real ways.  There are those who believe things in the here and now really are that bad.  At the very least, they wish to prevent it from getting worse.<br /><br />The message of violence in this book is a little unsettling.  A few years ago, I would have shaken my fist in the air and, with V, called for revolution.  But now?  I believe revolution should be a slow and democratic process.  Even if it is painful.  Because violence is much more painful, and often ends in worse tyranny.  In that sense, I hope people take this book as metaphor.  Let the outrage show in persuasive words, not bombs, or even in angry words.  In the end, well-formed arguments have liberated more nations from oppression.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is nice the only bad thing is that we have to pay if we want money but all the thing about the game is ok and so clear. its perfect for all
B003XRELEI|5.0|I have red most of Vonnegut's books and I love them all. If you never read anything from Vonnegut do not start with this one. Start with Slaughter House 5 or Cats Craddle. It is better to have an idea what you are in for. His books are intelligent and funny in a sad way. It's not easy to explain nor to compare it to any other author. Download it, enjoy it and love it.

0670022411|1.0|I have never written a book review before but felt the need to help others looking for their next good read.  I love to read and will read almost anything I can get my hands on.  I especially enjoy books that involve the supernatural.  I was totally mislead by all the good reviews on this site and paid a whopping $12.99 (an abusurd price) for an ebook version of this book.  This book is bad.  The author goes into rambling descriptions of unnecessary information-mainly meals but other random things too.  The plot is hard to follow, the characters are one dimensional and odd, the story does not suck you in as it should.  I actually stopped reading this book, something I never do.  I warn you, hold onto your hard earned money and look elsewhere for your next book.  This one is a total waste.
0783228007|4.0|Deals with a particularly disgusting chapter of American history--a time in which the land of Mexican Americans living in what had become the U.S. Southwest was being stolen from them, many times with the cooperation of the American court system.  And this film shows the contempt, arrogance. and the all too often outright murder that those  original settlers were subjected to----and this  after almost one half of Mexico had been stolen by the U.S. in a little adventure called the Mexican War.  Others have given you the plot of this movie.  Although it is another of Clint's Westerns on the level of his spaghetti westerns with all their implausibility, this one does have some merit.  It really isn't bad and is worth a watching. John Sturges did a good job with the directing and the scenery is fantastic.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is so fun but it riper Mario off allitle. I like it though so u should get it kay
B000VLE3GA|5.0|I had been looking for this compilation in music storesin the So Fla. area for some time. I decided to try Amazon just to check availability. I found this and placed an order. Delivery confirmation was instantaneous, and I received the CD in less than 2 weeks! It was shipped from the U.K., and apart from a small crack in the case, the item was not dammaged. If you are a fan of Led Zepplin, this is a must for your collection.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|-This game is a entertaining game..I hilly segest this ton 10 year Ole's and 11.,...........hi hi hi this au ks
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. the graphics are amazing, but the graphics of the characters walking around look different than the graphics of everything else. other than that I loooove it.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I have only played with this app for about 20 minutes and already I like it a lot! So much to do, so much to learn and it all sounds really good! Great app and worth every penny.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Everything I was hoping it would be. It matched the book and filled in the picture created by the books, can't wait for season 2.
1400052181|2.0|My book group recently finished reading this book, and I am embarrassed that I am the one who recommended it to the group (based on the Amazon reviews I read).  Not one person in our group of 10 enjoyed this book or could say they would recommend it to a friend.  I felt duped by so many positive reviews, but I should have paid more attention to the negative ones.  Yes, the book gets off to a good start.  The first third is interesting, particularly learning about the cell science and the history of research ethics and abuses.  But, then the book goes downhill - the story becomes very boring and there is way too much detail about a family that is not interesting or compelling.  By half way through, you are wondering how in the world the author is going to fill another 150+ pages when there doesn't seem to be a a story left.  By the end (if you make it), you realize that there never was enough to make a book out of this story.  Our entire group agreed that the science of the story was interesting, but the family part, which was necessary to make this into a book, is not.  We all would have enjoyed reading this story as a magazine article, but not a 300+ page book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had no idea what this book was when I downloaded it as a Prime selection.  I hate to admit it but I selected it because it was #1 of the paid Kindle books, soooo....  When I started reading it, I had to stop and go and actually read a description of what the heck this book was.  That's when I saw that this was a \\"young adult\\" book - and then found out that my grandson had read this series last year in the 6th grade.  Sigh....  He was absolutely RAVING about this series and has proclaimed it as his very favorite book to date.  OK.  So now that I realized I was now reading a kid's book, I was a little non-pulsed, but being it DID seem to be pretty clever, I figured what the heck and soldiered on.  (BTW - this was before they announced they had filmed the first book and would be releasing the movie in March 2012.)  I am very glad I decided to continue to read this book and then the other two in the series.  The premise is pretty clever and I really found myself getting wrapped up in the lives of the main characters.  It is about a post-apocalyptic country comprised of 13 districts, 12 of the districts specializing in a specific production of goods, supplies, etc. to supply the other districts, but mainly the 13th district, which is known as the Capital.  The Capital houses all the privileged people who come up with various ways to keep themselves amused.  One of those is a kind of futuristic gladiator games with dire results - and horrific premise of taking 24 children at random every year (one boy and one girl whose names are drawn in a lottery type event) to be taken to the Capital in a game to the death - until only one survivor remains. Loved Katniss' courage and quick wits of survival.  She was one gutsy little girl!  Bottom line - I loved it!
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|Ever since I heard they were making this movie I was SO excited.  When I saw it in the theater (both times) it was everything I hoped it would be.  Jason Segel and Amy Adams bring the music that Brett McKenzie created to life (along with the muppets of course).  This movie is an instant classic, I have yet to watch this movie with someone who didn't fall in love with it right away!  I give this movie to green thumbs up!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Great action film and the best of the Tom Cruise series.  I was wondering if anyone has a Blu-ray disc that a DTS soundtrack on it?  My copy will not play the Dolby TruHD soundtrack.  The DTS is not even the MasterHD track.  Do I have a defective disc?
B003O85W3A|5.0|This was the most exciting album I heard in 2010. In 2011 it won the Grammy for Best Album of the Year. As with their other albums Neon Bible and Funeral, The Suburbs is thematic and a collective experience. The songs belong together like pieces of a puzzle and their arrangement is a story with a beginning and an end. Actually you could even say some songs are paired up like two different characters in the same scene but from unique perspectives. For example, in Sprawl I (Flatlands), Win seems to express a moment in time from a very somber point of view, while Regine sings Sprawl II (Mountains beyond Mountains) with ethereal lightness -- though deceptively so, because the lyrics are still on one level about running into cops on the street and on another, about existential crisis. This band is awesome, this album raised the bar for musical releases that had degenerated into disjointed MP3 singles, and the members of this group are very committed to good causes -- consistently raising money and awareness for those suffering in Haiti still from a terrible earthquake that happened only a few years back. I still listen to this album two years later and love it as much as the first time.
1580084621|5.0|This book is almost 700 pages long and goes into detail about every aspect of Thai cooking.  I haven't finished reading it yet -- that may be a few years away! -- but I have read enough to see that it is solid and extremely well-informed.  This is NOT an amateur effort.<br /><br />For example, one thing that may seem \\"backwards\\" to foreigners is the very idea that when you are eating, you are eating RICE.  Those other dishes that go with the rice -- the curries, soups and salads that people rave about -- are generically known as \\"kab khaaw\\" -- \\"with rice.\\"  The author gets this point absolutely right.<br /><br />Another point of distinction: where other books may mention sticky rice and jasmine rice, this book has a CHAPTER devoted to the history and cultivation of rice.<br /><br />The only downside is that the recipes can be extraordinarily complex and time-consuming, not such a swell idea if you are cooking for one.  On the other hand, if you're a member of the royal family, or simply very rich, you can have it all done for you.  It's one of the reasons food is getting simpler these days: you have to do it yourself or pay someone else to do it for you.  And is it worth working ten hours to enjoy ten minutes of wonderful food?<br /><br />Still, all this says nothing against this book, which is a flat-out masterpiece.  And some of the recipes are so tempting that I'll probably give them a go, sooner or later.  At the very least, the author has written down true Thai recipes for future generations, and deserves huge credit for that.<br /><br />The photographs are superb as well.<br /><br />For those who only occasionally aspire to the summit, I still recommend [[ASIN:0811800172 Real Thai: The Best of Thailand's Regional Cooking]] for everyday use.  This would be for people who actually buy their curry pastes ready-made at the market, rather then whomping them up at home.  In any case, if you have these two books, it's very hard to go wrong.<br /><br />Highest possible recommendation!e recommendation!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Love this game reminds me of super mario. great game to pass the time to, wish it allowed more than one person play
0062112430|5.0|This book was amazing and beautifully wrighten. It has a wonderful message also. There is action, love, and a novel in this book. I couldn't put it down. This book is about how we have a choice of our own. We don't have to listen to others or let other people choose what we have to think. Also this book is about LOVE. Love isn't wrong, it's beautiful. Deliria is beautiful. The others take away love because they think love causes turmoil and corruption. Love brings peace and harmony. I highly recomend reading this book for everyone. If you like The Hunger Games you will love this!
0767020308|5.0|This rendition of the Jane Austen classic depicts the characters with a sense of reality. Each is portrayed with believability and real human expression, not the \\"stilted\\" air that is common in the older versions. While no film can do complete justice to reading Austen's character development, this version is the most well-rounded of it's time.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book! The tormented, domineering Christian Grey is hotter than hell. Even so, there is some hidden secret that makes him so fragile. Can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy and see what ultimately becomes of Christian & Ana's relationship!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Okay, as a writer you can watch the AMC TV show, Breaking Bad, purely for the plot twists, cliff-hangers, nuanced characters, foreshadowing, little bits of backstory that come in just the right places, the way a character will show and tell with actions rather than speech, and the goal motivation and conflict that is clearly spelled out for each of the main characters. But who am I kidding? I follow this show because it is spellbinding. I'm sucked in and totally invested in each of these characters -- players in a show with a premise I initially rejected because of the content: It is about a highschool chemistry teacher who becomes a meth cook.<br /><br />I am anti-drug and never seek out violence in anything I watch, but I do love complex drama and a show that digs deep on why people do the things they do. It's not what they do, but why they do it that drives this show.<br /><br />Like Mad Men (another favorite), which is also on AMC, Breaking Bad features a main character that is hiding something and will act with increasing desperation and creeping self-awareness to protect and justify his actions. The character changes, goes through turning points in his life and you respond on a visceral level, because you've connected with the gritty realism of his situation, which makes almost anything possible.<br /><br />Of course it helps that AMC has found extraordinary actors for the characters in Breaking Bad, but I do think it is the writing and the willingness to explore the human psyche that has laid the foundation for its greatness.<br /><br />Wow, what a show! If you watch it, start from the beginning. This show has one final season to come which I believe will be released in 2013.
B004SRNH10|1.0|like i said, won't open. i wasted money on an app that needs this to work properly and it doesn't work.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|When i got this game it wouldn't even let me play it said&quot;This game cant be updated&quot; dont get this game!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|First of all, let me say these are different than any type of series I have ever read.  But I am glad that I did.<br /><br />I read all three books in this series.  One right after another. The author makes these characters come to life, while giving us a glimse into the darkest parts of their pasts and their natures. I encourage you to not stop with the first book and see these characters to their happy ending.<br /><br />The first book I would probably give 4 stars.  It is a little intense - for lack of a better word.  But it leaves you wanting more of the story for these characters.  It addresses the inner most thoughts and actions of the two main characters.  It is necessary.<br /><br />The second book I would give 4 stars.  The characters are developed more, as well as subplots.  It takes you a level futhter into the lives of our dark hero and his obsession.<br /><br />The third book I would give 5 stars.  I personally enjoyed all the ending had to offer.  I was actually sad to see the end of the book.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoyed this game until it did an update. Then I had to start over at level 1 again.  Not cool!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game was fun could use a little better variety because more games came alike but sooooo fun get it. its fun for everyone u will enjoy. I think they should have some new games or more common games like checkers or chess.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|pretty good kinda like Mario bros . controls work good on the kindle fire and pretty easy to play.graphics are good too.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|like this game a lot hard to save money but fun you should give it a chance it is iceage
B007SYWFRM|1.0|i really cant say a thing about this game. it downloads...then trys to update...then tells me i am not connected to the net. i have deleted and reloaded it severl times. for me...it just wont work. 1* for wasting my time.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|It is amazing how just a short time ago I really didn't know who Joe Bonamassa was. Thanks to the PBS special of the Beacon concert, I learned that the art of guitar playing had reached new heights. How can I say this? I have been playing for 50 years, been around some of the best, and thought I had heard the best. Suddenly this 30-year old wonder burst into my consciousness with a creativity, taste, and technical virtuosity not reflected by many. Many people would point to Stevie Ray, Jimmie Hendrix, Doc Watson, Raun MacKinnon, Jerry Miller, and other virtuosos who displayed these kinds of characteristics, but none of them except for him has gone further. Listen to the haunting modal solo where he simultaneously hits harmonic notes while moving the volume knob with his little pinky. Listen to his fabulous cross picking on a great Martin in the opening busking piece, and then later on, the fabulous flat and finger picking piece on an acoustic while on stage. Listen to his lovely singing. His accuracy and timing are impeccable, and the speed is not only Ferrari fast, but tastefully done so that each note is clear and purposeful. Listen to Slash, a Les Paul speed freak who wears you out with noise, not wise playing. Bonamassa owns hundreds of guitars, and uses each for selected songs. He is the new standard. Enjoy him while you can.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Love this!!! it has all the music I want!! the best part is that I Ltd for freed!!! you don't have to buy ANY of the songs!!!!!!!! if I was u I would get this app:)
0142418471|5.0|Wow. Again just wow. I laughed. I cried. I got it. I will admit I was a bit uneasy about reading about a homosexual relationship. I don't have a problem with it, but I thought I just preferred to not read about. That is until will grayson (lack of capitals is the stylistic distinguishing factor between the two Wills) meets Tiny and describes falling in love or better said, feels the hope, compassion and understanding shining out of Tiny. This was one of the most beautiful falling in love scenes I've read. I'm getting really tired of the only reason two characters in YA books fall in love is because of fate. In fact on p.47 Will Grayson describes the little, inexplicable things that make you fall in love and I noted \\"Here we see why someone falls in love. It's not just fate.\\"<br /><br />Tiny is an unforgettable character and though I hate mentioning role models to be found in fiction, he is indeed one: a fabulously gay character who is pretty much ok with himself but not without some self-doubt. He has a heart as big as his body and maybe even bigger. Everybody, adult or teen, could learn from him.<br /><br />I have read all John Green books in the past two months. This one I didn't immediately jump on because I don't usually like books written by two authors. This is one of the rare instances where this trick works. Admittedly I did for the most part prefer the Green chapters but the Levathon chapters, particularly at the end, also shine.<br /><br />As an adult reader, English teacher and mother of teens I want to address suitability issues. As always parents should read and discuss any book their teens are interested in. This book is in no way sexually explicit. There are some kisses, both straight and gay though in neither case is there any extravagant description. It focuses more on the emotions felt by the characters. There are a few instances of f words. There is mention of masturbation. These characters, as are true of all Green characters, are very realisticand strong language and masturbation are real aspects of teen life, but if you don't want your teen to read about, you have been warned. The main theme of the book is love in any form: gay, straight, parent, child, friend. Tiny's speech at the end of his musical, though a little cheesy, is very real and realistic.
0439023513|2.0|Spoiler warning!!..<br />I had so much hope for this book. I flew through the first, then through the second, but as I read this installment, it seemed to grind to a slow, dragging, almost boring chore. Katniss, instead of developing character mostly hides away and is dull.  It had a few surprises that actually affected me but they were quickly brushed aside by the apparent insignificance of their importance to the author despite the significance to the characters and reader. I don't really get why Gale just disappears, guess he didn't lover her THAT much! Weird. And Haymitch... just drinks himself to death? I get what Collins was getting at but it seemed to me that she just needed to be done with this series. I think that there should have been one more book,  this feeling as if the story is not finished..
B00005JLEU|5.0|Lots of life lessons are camouflaged within storyline of this beautifully animated Japanese children's story - messages about standing by your friends, helping other people, being brave in the face of your greatest fears, and the dangers of over-consumption (people literally turning into pigs from overeating - and demons who regurgitate endless streams of flotsam and jetsam of their lives).<br /><br />I especially like the fact that the hero is a little girl who starts the film as a very frightened, possibly over-frightened kid, worried about moving to a new school, but it ends up with her outwitting witches and demons of various kinds, and sticking by her friends regardless of the peril.<br /><br />It might be a bit dark and/or scary for little kids, and it will make even older kids stretch their minds a little, but it's well worth it.
0312576463|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel, but there were parts that were a little too 'real' for my liking (like Joey's fantasy - I won't say more).<br /><br />The novel is about a lot of things including marriage, family, friendship, deception, depression and betrayal and I particularly like these kind of stories. I love the underlying message that we should learn to live together and respectfully disagree when we have to without becoming full of hatred and vitriol - what joy can there be in lashing out at someone else when silence is better? It's a good lesson, but I expect it will fall on deaf ears. I can see why Oprah wanted it in her book club.<br /><br />Enjoyed The Corrections too.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I love this movie. The dvd came fast and without defects. I think this movie is one to add to any good collection.
B007HNFREW|5.0|A little too much sex and gore, but the plot really starts to thicken.  This series really drew me in and I can't wait for every \\"next\\" episode.
B0008ENICU|4.0|They say that when George Cukor was fired from \\"Gone with the Wind\\" because Clark Gable disliked him, he decided to make an entire film without men, and the result was \\"The Women\\". Maybe this is an urban legend, but the fact is that the film is a superb comedy with a great cast. Rosalind Russell as Sylvia is the funniest and the best, but Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Mary Boland, Paulette Goddard ad a very young Joan Fontaine are all very good. Of course, it`s a play with lots of dialogue, but the famous MGM glamour in sets, costumes (with a fashion show in Technicolor!) and 'more stars that there are in Heaven', under the direction of a master like Cukor, is really something worth while. More than 70 years later, it still is a real joy.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|lot of fun really like it, I also like the movies I think that I like so much,  if you like ice age this is for you
B004LWZW7Y|2.0|I really like Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek, but this film is a total disappointment.  It can be amazing to see an actor doing all kinds of amazing action moves, but cartoon characters doing flips and spins and such is not at all impressive.  I could only watch about 20 minutes of it before total boredom set in.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I have this game on my ipod one of my favs been waiting for it for my fire and now its here thanks glu for the epic freeness one of the best mobile game devs out there keep it up .....
B0061S0A64|1.0|I am not a musician.  I must not understand this app because all of the music sounds the same to me.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|First, I'll say I haven't read the books.  Second, I'll say rarely do I watch a TV series, cable or otherwise, but this show drew me in.  For those that cringe at sex scenes and graphic gore, this show is not for you.  Now for my review.  The casting of the actors in their roles was excellent.  The actors bring the characters to life.  The plot, and intrigue it creates, keeps me hungry for the next episode, the equivalent of a page turner in book lingo.  I streamed the first two episodes, because of the super long netflix wait, and then netflixed the rest.  The information and extra features on the blueray disks is awesome.  The details about the 7 kingdoms and the history all the way back to \\"The First Men\\", and \\"The children of the Forest\\" is great fiction.  Going through all the extra information really helps connect all the plot twists and makes the storyline even more enjoyable.  I've spent as much time watching the episodes as reading about the continents of Westeros and Essos.  All of these things are what draws me into this Epic Series.  In closing, I'll say that some of the sex scenes and gore are a little over the top, but everything I previously mentioned keeps me coming back for more.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am having a blast playing this game. the characters are so like the movies it is fun to play with them.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|and it's so much better than similar games on Facebook because you don't have to worry about energy.  If you go to your stuff and setting your bottom bar will appear to exit the game. Don't listen to those reviewers who haven't figured that out.
B001BZGA8Y|4.0|Although this watch is a men's watch, I bought it for my wife after she tried it in our local Swatch store. Compared to similar sized Michele, the design is a bit rougher, and I clearly  see why it is categorized for men. The price is very attractive, and so is the piece itself. Something similar from [[ASIN:B00338C86A Michele]], Tag, or Rado for sure will cost at least ten times more.<br /><br />I didn't think through regarding the size of wrist bracelet when I ordered the watch from Amazon, and it became the source of a little frustration. I managed to break my iPhone sim card pin tool  in the process of removing the chain links from the bracelet. If you are thinking about resizing the band yourself, get a cheap Link Remover tool like [[ASIN:B000HDJT6Q SE Watchband Link Remover Tool]], or invest in a good one. It will ease the process for you and save a lot of trouble.<br /><br />The watch that we received had no issues and worked just fine out of the box. The battery is quite strong and works perfectly. If you are thinking about getting this watch, rest assured that it is a beautiful piece and is worth the price.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I don't know what all the negative reviews are for ive played dungeon hunters 2 and this is different from that game but still fun def not console grade gaming but does what its suppose to do gaming on the go and runs great on fire.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book..great writing. Would recommend this book for all to read. Looking forward to reading the next book. Enjoy
B00005NRO3|5.0|This movie is a revenge movie. I enjoy the scream movies! I am a huge fan! I would for sure recommend this!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love leps world its just like mario bros.I think leps world should have Mario so they could race.They should also have Luigi, mario and leps  so they could race.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Wow!  What a way to end the trilogy.  Salander finally is vindicated and the ending to this book left me wanting more.  I am going to miss this lead character tremendously.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|When I saw the trailer for this movie, I knew I wanted to see it, explosions, gun fights, it just looked like a great combat movie. When my brother and I went to see the movie, we left awe struck. We knew it would be a great movie, but our hearts raced, we couldn't believe what we were watching. You get attached. The movie is real easy to follow. Not going to spoil anything, but at the end of the movie, as you thought they couldn't throw anything else at you, they do. After seeing this movie, even if you already respected our troops, you'll have a new respect for what it means to be a soldier. Great movie!!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I LOVED this Sonic Screwdriver toy! It was very well made, it felt a little light compared to the others. I overall enjoyed theis sonic very much and I can't wait to see what comes out next!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I don't play a lot of game but this one I can get addicted to very enjoyable game. Good job
B002ZG9968|5.0|I love this movie. It made me cry and laugh at the same time. I love this movie, I love this movie.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I'm usually disappointed in the free app of the day so wasn't expecting much.  &quot;You get what you pay for&quot;  Couldn't be more wrong in this case!  So much fun, it's hard to put down.  All the different options, you can create for hours on end, or just sit back and relax with it.  If I had known about this before I would have paid for it.  Three thumbs up!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I enjoyed this Stieg Larsson trilogy so much that I am so disappointed that there will be no more in the series due to the author's death.  Book 2 in the trilogy was even more enjoyable than the first as we learn more about Salander and her world.  This was a very fast read and thoroughly enjoyable!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|yeah I got the very first review yipee what fun I am so happy this is the best day of my life I an the happiest man on earth
B007PTJOV0|1.0|dontbget this game because after awhile when you r just about to reach the checkpoint n u like hit into a snail or whatever,  then u die and start all over! AND THAT HAPPENS QUITE A FEW TIMES!!!!!!!!!!&gt;:(
B005K17RU0|2.0|i downloaded this app but never had the opportunity to use it because it never worked. so i just deleted it
B00008K7AM|5.0|This is a very funny movie. An attractive and popular teenager who is mean spirited toward others, finds herself in the body of an older man, and must find a way to get back to her original body.
B004LWZW7E|3.0|I agree, I purchased it because I was hoping that other's statements ran true, but in the end I may have just purchased a third-rate movie with second-rate acting! I agree too that the idea was good and the plot seemed reasonable, however the story line was most definitely Lacking something solid, perhaps a foundation! A classic story where the rich get rich by using the poor like stepping stones.<br />  I doubt I would have purchased it had it not had a decent cover and up-and-coming actor/actress characters starring in it, but although Justin Timberlake did an outstanding job making his character come alive, it was a classic bad-boy underprivileged gets the rich girl scenario and perhaps that is the reason It was a waste of money for me! Perhaps Hastings will buy it from me for close to what I paid for it! which wasn't much, but almost too much!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its like playing Mario bros. I love it as well as my 5 year old daughter too! so much fun
B004UID2LC|4.0|I use this app constantly.  I use it to watch videos and download music onto my kindle!  It crashes sometimes but I still think the app is worth it.  plus, its free!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game but I wish u didn't have to buy more energy all the time to keep playing. I can only play in 5 minute increments.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|Kudos to the author for representing the experience of expats. The observations of that life and the differences one finds in Europe are liberally sprinkled throughout this thriller. In terms of the plot, the author attempts to emulate Le Carre with action limited in favor of tense twists. Unfortunately, I had difficulty accepting the main character's wildly improbably former career in the CIA. Kate Moore would have been more endearing and the novel more interesting if she was a sharp mom and not an accomplished operator. It makes things to pat from the get-go. Still, I enjoyed the outing and appreciated the attempts to keep the reader guessing. The book is largely mundane until the last few pages which will either be well received or seen as contrived.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|This is a good movie. The same as it has been but digitally remastered. Very good movie. Would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Bonnie Raitt has been, over a long career, a great singer, a great guitarist, a great band leader and a great performer. Sure, some of her albums have been better than others, but each one is at least a solid four stars. This is a five star Bonnie Raitt album. Worth the wait. The full range of passion and sheer joy.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I've had office pro for bout 6 months n jst like having my desktop with me and the remote file is a great feature
B007PBKG5G|5.0|There is not a thing I didn't like about this - great band, soulful voice and a huge amount of talent.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. It hooked me right from the start which is sort of rare when I first start reading a new author or series. It is definitely shorter than most series I have read lately, but honestly it was refreshing. I never lost interest in the series once, which usually happens, even in good books. I'd definitely recommend reading this if you're a sci fi fan, or even if not!
B000P0J0AQ|2.0|I purchased the movie to use for my senior English classes (lesson comparing it to A Brave New World) and it skipped horribly throughout the entire movie. It was incredibly distracting to the students and basically ruined three days of lesson plans since the film is too outdated to find anywhere else. So much for planning ahead.
B0002KVUKW|5.0|I enjoy this movie, I still watch it. It is very good, has a little bit of a love story to it as well..
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I have been addicted to this game since I got it a week ago. play on my kindle fire. however, this morning I went to check on my buildings and crops and everything said it wouldn't be ready for 176 hours!! I tried reloading and updating, but no luck. disappointed that I'll probably have to uninstall and start over. I'll change to 5 stars if problem is fixed
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely loved reading this book.  It is not often a science fiction book can create a world so unique and thought-provoking.  I was unable to put this book down after certain chapters and would literally force myself to stop.  A great science fiction read to anyone who wants to marvel at the possibilities of a disastrous future.

0143034901|4.0|The Shadow of the Wind, A New York Times Besteller written by Carlos Ruiz Zafon, was a refreshing yet challenging read for myself. Set in Barcelona, Spain this novel was full of twists and turns one would never expect--leaving the reader on a constant page-turner rampage. It tells the story of a young boy, Daniel Siempre who inadvertently throws himself into the engimas of the forgotten book The Shadow of the Wind.  This book within a book was written by Julian Carax, an unrecognized author whose works are being burned all over the world until Daniel owns the only copy remaining. In the streets of Barcelona a shadowy figure stalks him with intentions of stealing his prize. This frightening man hides behind the scarred face of one of the book characters: the devil. He is described on page 56, \\"He had no nose, lips, or eyelids. His face was nothing but a mask of black scarred skin, consumed by fire.\\"<br />The setting of the book was really spectacular. I was able to comprehend and envision an entire town from The Cemetery of Forgotten Books to the dilapidated Aldaya mansion.  It even has a map of all the mention streets in the back for reference.  It was very cryptic and dark in nature but without this element, it wouldn't have been the same. It gives the reader a nail-biting feeling of suspense. Along with this gothic theme, the corky characters balance it out providing a humorous outlet. Although there are many characters to keep track of because Daniel relies on them to unravel the mystery of the Shadow of the Wind, this makes for a difficult but satisfying plot structure.<br />Lastly, the literary connotations of this book are incredible. The character development was ongoing and constant as Daniel finds himself in search for Julian Carax. His story aligns with that of his favorite author and because of that, he believes it to be fate that brought him to The Shadow of the Wind. The reader clearly understand this in the ending, which in my opinion was the pinnacle of superb literary construction. One does not see it coming and the conclusion left me fully satiated as I was mulling over the conflicting details  for chapters before then! Overall the setting, theme, and characters provided a good foundation to start only the beginning of many mysteries tangled within each other. It was for this reason that The Shadow of the Wind is a excellent read for anybody looking for suspense and wild plot twists that will give you whiplash!of superb literary construction.

B00008EY65|5.0|I Love this movie. I would recommend this to everyone. It has some amazing features and it a good movie.
B0041KKYBA|1.0|This movie misses the point entirely. The regulatory environment, the Federal Reserves easy money policies, the revolving door cozy relationship between government and industry, all created the environment in which these bad operators could do what they did. Without the easy money of the Fed, none of it would have been possible to begin with or at least would have been severely limited. Then to top it all off, rather then let these bad operators go bankrupt the government bailed them out, with one notable exception being Lehman brothers, and other smaller operators. But the large well connected banks got bailed out. If the government had just done one thing differently, say not bailed out anyone, then they would have all paid the price for acting irresponsibly by being out of business. But no, we can't do that because having a senator yell at you is far worse then becoming poor due to your own mismanagement. Being called before Congress is nothing to these guys, and it is Congress that created the problem to begin with. Congress and the government IS the problem here. They create the moral hazard. So what is the lesson to these guys after this? Well if I was one of them, I would think that I made money while things were good, and thanks to Uncle Sam I made money after the crash, where is the downside? I guess I will do it again. That is exactly what is going on now. They are doing it again. What should have happened is that the government should NOT have bailed anyone out, and let the chips fall where they may. They would have fallen hard I can tell you, and now we would have a new crop of boys in Wall Street who would be entering it well aware of what happened to that last bunch that tried to rig things. But no, we can't do that, we have to bail out every last one of them.<br /><br />BTW, the idea that Greenspan is somehow a free market guy, please there is absolutely nothing free market about the Federal Reserve whatsoever. It is a government enforced banking cartel pure and simple, it is about as free market as the Soviet Politburo. It is nothing more then a central committee that controls the money supply and the interest rates. Nothing free market about central committees and central economic planning. It is the very opposite of free market.el pure and simple, it is about as free market as the Soviet Politburo.

030758836X|3.0|Sure, if a woman disappears, the husband is the first to be suspected. So, when Amy disappears, Nick is the first to be scrutinized. Nick doesn't help, either, since there are some things that he really doesn't want anyone else to know. Naturally, he conceals these embarrassing details, because he knows that he is not guilty.<br /><br />However, when other details emerge, Nick's secrets also emerge. Each little item revealed points strongly to Nick's guilt and undercuts his credibility. Except that Nick is pretty sure that some of these details aren't quite real, even when these details have very physical proof that they are real. For the reader, too, it becomes a little disorienting (intentionally by the author) as to what is reality and what is invention.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn tells this tale in two voices: Nick and Amy. As we read, our sympathies switch back and forth until--Sorry, you gotta read this for yourself.
0439023521|5.0|This book had me hooked from the first page and I could barely put it down. I thought it was fast paced, well worth the time and the money, and kept me entertained, and I then read the next two books in the Trilogy.<br /><br />I love the world that it's set in, a very dystopian society that requires tributes of teenage/young adults competing in a battle to the death. This is not a new \\"theme\\" but it is a fresh take on the story line that made me really appreciate Katniss and her struggle.<br /><br />Well worth the time and the money.

B004XJRQUQ|1.0|Scares me to think that the plot of having children fight to the death for sport, with all the bloody details, no holds barred...can actually be this huge of a hit in our society.  mental illness, extreme vanity, with the main character who is a classic sociopath.  really crappy books. Shame on all the parents who let their children read this garbage.
B0061S0A64|1.0|Musician and I do understand it, but this is good for spacing out with doxbies, not really for composition. 4 stars for creative interface and spacy sounds, way to zone like staring into the rain during a heavy storm<br />UPDATE: I got this when it was a faotd the first time- when I installed it to try again (same phone- Galaxy SII), it tries to download something then force closes (FC).<br />  Tried clearing data, moving to main storage, still FC. Unsure what's different...zero stars.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Glen has always been a woman with a determined spirit and in this book she has allowed us to see the struggle behind that spirit.  She articulates with grace and love how she and her family rallied, splintered and then embarked on the journey of coming together.  David wouldn't be who he is today without his family and they wouldn't be who they are without these many years of learning to adapt, accept, protect and love.  \\"Hope\\" might not be the right word but only the belief in hope could pull 5 people with disparate needs forward.<br /><br />Glen amplifies the family's day-to-day events with a wonderful, literary voice.  We see the light in the windows, the music that always rang out of that house, the riot of sports gear, the woods to run through and to and a family that has held tight, even if as delicate and tentative as Michelangelo's \\"The Touch.\\"<br /><br />Thank you Glen.
B003HGKJH8|5.0|Incredible sound. Spaced-out, melodic, driven, trippy, lush, pop/psych music. Listen on headphones while relaxing and absorbing the experience.  Best modern record with nods to classic sounds.

B004MC8CA2|1.0|This app has a dark side that is making me unload it and not look back.  It lurks in the background and pops up suggesting,  demanding that it is past time for you to read your Bible instead of what you are doing. If you get behind on your reading plan or (God forbid)  go on a mission trip away from the Internet it would probably come hunting for you.  This would be the perfect tool for al Qaeda indoctrination if the text of the Koran were substituted. Out of my face and banned from my tablet. Beware!
B0061S0A64|5.0|Fun, creative-type toy.  It reminds me a lot of playing with keyboard synthesizers when I was a kid. Just experimenting with adjusting settings and moving things around until something great happens!  I discovered some nice melodies playing around.<br /><br />I get the feeling that if one spent a lot of time to really learn this thing it could also be useful for some more serious music making -- but it's also easy to simply pick up and play with.

B006Z21ZJC|3.0|I will not comment on Iron Maiden. It is one of the five most influential and important bands in the history of Heavy Metal (Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, AC/DC and Metallica are the other 4). But the band just gave up innovation. Opted to follow the path of repetition.<br /><br />Iron Maiden released four DVDs in recent years: Rock in Rio, Death in the Road, Flight 666 and this En Vivo. On average, each DVD has about 17 songs. Nearly half of them are the same in the 4 DVDs...Trooper, 2 Minutes, Fear of Dark, Hallowed, IM, Number, Hills ... Do they not get tired of playing always the same thing? Do they not realise that we get tired to watch a \\"new\\" DVD with the same set list every time?<br /><br />Today's technology allows 20 cameras to take over the stage, shooting from all possible angles with zooms, details, etc... But in the editing they do not need to show everything that 20 cameras filmed all the time.<br /><br />In fact we can not see the show. We can not really see any musician playing. They switch from one image to another every 2 seconds. Seriously. This irritated me so much that I started to count...at every 2 seconds the image changes. I like to see the musicians playing. The camera has to stop in the guy to show his hand doing gymnastics, raining fingers on the fretboard. But the scene switches from the guitar solo to Nicko's knee then to the audience screaming, then to Dickinson jumping and going to the Gers pirouetting...and solo is finished.<br /><br />Another very annoying point... the screen splits to show 2 or 3 pictures .... look, it is already hard to see an image every 2 seconds, imagine a screen with 3 frames! Like Dickinson singing from two different angles which alternates with the aerial view of the stadium while Harris plays bass and Gers kicks the air.... all in the same scene....and you have only 2 seconds to see it.<br /><br />Final comment: the band's performance is exactly the same as always. Dickinson runs the whole stage, leaps, jumps and tries to behave like an adolescent from the audience. And the three guitarists in the band ... It's impossible to believe that they are working hard...they play the same music every night...but they show faces like those riffs were demanding a lot of dedication...Murray plays a chord and raises arm. Lack naturalness in presentation, the show is exactly the same rehearsed for so long. The same as any of the previous DVDs. I am sorry Iron Maiden...I am a fan of the band...but it's a shame.

B004EPZ03O|4.0|I was so disappointed with Disney's recent attempt to revive the Winnie the Pooh \\"franchise\\" that I had little faith they would do any better with the Muppets.<br /><br />Was I wrong!  This is a sweet and hilarious film, perhaps the best Muppets effort ever.<br /><br />Now for sure, the absence of Jim Henson and Frank Oz are felt here -- but so are the Muppets!  Wocka wocka!<br /><br />Seriously, though, this movie will be welcome to all the fans of the Muppet TV series and movies, and serve as a superior introduction to a younger generation who may wonder just what magic muppetry can provide in the age of CGI.<br /><br />The jokes here work -- even Fozzy's!  The songs are cute -- and they don't go on too long!  There are many cameos of celebrities both young and old!  (And I'm dating myself when I admit that I didn't have a clue who the young man portraying the human version of Walter the Muppet is -- I didn't recognize his face or his name.  Is this guy a pop star?  A reality TV person?  He looks too slight to be an athlete and too young to be a politician. Ah well...)<br /><br />In addition, the muppetry has never been more seamless -- the Muppet performances and fluid direction combine to make you forget you're looking at marionettes from the git go.<br /><br />Of the human performers on display here, the Muppets deploy a secret weapon -- Amy Adams.  She is simply sensational in her role as the hapless Gary the human's dear and long-suffering fiancee -- and she can also fix a car or an electrical system without breaking a nail!<br /><br />I can't pay Ms. Adams a higher tribute than to say that she more than holds her own sharing a song with Miss Piggy.  Only the most charismatic and adept performers can accomplish that, given the porcine performer's prodigious scene-stealing prowess!<br /><br />And like the very best family movies, this one will bring a tear (or two or three) to the eyes of generations who have grown up with these endearing felt creations.<br /><br />I have deducted one star only because this DVD has only one bonus feature, a \\"Blooper Reel\\" that runs a scant ten minutes or so.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but there is simply no excuse for the omission of the director's commentary and making-of featurette that appear in the Blu-Ray edition, and the Disney Company seems not to have paid any attention to the movie's essential message: that an attempt to try and do something worthwhile in the company of old and dear friends trumps any venal grab for money or power.<br /><br />So forty lashes with a wet noodle for Disney execs -- and kudos and props and a hearty welcome back for the Frog, Pig, Bear, Daredevil, Drummer, Chickens, Chef, and all their colleagues and collaborators here.<br />I have deducted one star only because this DVD has only one bonus feature, a \\"Blooper Reel\\" that runs a scant ten minutes or so.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but there is simply no excuse for the omission of the director's commentary and making-of featurette that appear in the Blu-Ray edition, and the Disney Company seems not to have paid any attention to the movie's essential message: that an attempt to try and do something worthwhile in the company of old and dear friends trumps any venal grab for money or power.<br /><br />So forty lashes with a wet noodle for Disney execs -- and kudos and props and a hearty welcome back for the Frog, Pig, Bear, Daredevil, Drummer, Chickens, Chef, and all their colleagues and collaborators here.

B001F7MSFM|5.0|2008 Supernatural superhero film based on the fictional Dark Horse Comics character Hellboy, starring Ron Perlman and Selma Blair. Good sequel.
B006PTL1QM|3.0|A very dialogue heavy film, which drags on quite a bit and there really are no characters to latch on to.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was intrigued with this book because it was different from what I usually read and I have never read a sex novel or porno magazine. I have to say, I was extrememly dissapointed with this book. I am also well into the second book because I keep thinking that it HAS TO GET BETTER but it has not even came close. In fact, it just keeps getting worse and worse. There is no depth to these books whatsoever. I never have gone and trashed a book before because I know many people have different tastes but I felt the need to write about this one to warn people to STAY AWAY!!!<br />How many times can you read about the same sex scene and how hott this Christian guy is. Give me a break. I also could not stand how she referred to herself as \\"down there\\" and her a** as her \\"behind.\\" The main character, Ana, is as ignorant as one can get.<br />I have to guess that the only reason these books got so popular is because women are living sex vicariously through these so called novels. Come on girls, go out there and live it in the real world. It's sex, not some dirty thing you have to be ashamed of and hide yourself in a novel for.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The series is very easy to read, and quite engrossing, but the writing tends to get a bit hackneyed by the last book, and the repetition of combat in each book (the Hunger games arena in books 1 and 2 and rebellion in book 3) tends to get a bit dull. Still, as a young adult book, it's quite good. I's essentially Battle Royale for kids.
B00006HBUA|5.0|You will fall in love with this movie. It is a great movie with tons of action and comedy in it. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
1118156315|5.0|I'm a college student and bought this book to start thinking about my career. It is really great for that, very good structure that guid you through the whole process leaving you with a perfect plan what you need to do, how you need to do it and most importsntly why you do it. Also I loved the visual appearance of the book.
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|I don't know but for whatever reason I just found this book to be completely hilarious. The writing was good, the characters were hot and sexy, but it was just freaking hilarious to me.<br /><br />The start of the book our heroine is a dentist who can't stand the sight of blood, that in and of itself is funny to me. You're a doctor type person. Act like it.<br /><br />I really like the action in this book. It went from being sexy, to all kinds of action and then back to sexy again. If you like paranormal romances that have a quirky heroine that's kind of nerdy and has some quirks then you'll love this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My kids love this game...Its fun and interactive. Everything about this game is right out of the Ice Age movies.

B007LEC7CC|1.0|I'm a casual fan. I gave this album a chance, but for a woman of her age and worldliness, this is it? Some songs about cheerleading, her birthday, corny hip hop, and trite, over-the-top anger at her ex? It all sounds weak and juvenile. And she's fifty something? The song about shooting her ex in the head is just cringeworthy. It actually starts off sounding promising but then just devolves into Madonna shouting \\"drive bitch, die bitch.\\" To me, it's embarrassing, uncomfortable, and in a way, irresponsible. Does she consider her partly spoken-word gibberish artsy or edgy? She seems more worried about rhyming like Dr. Seuss than saying something interesting, fresh or new. It's almost like Madonna doesn't really exist on this record. It could be a computer programmed to sing the songs over lots of swirling electronic noise -over and over. That's kind of what it feels like. There is barely one iota of feeling here. I'm not saying she's washed up, but she needs to find \\"herself.\\" Perhaps I'm being overly hopeful as this is pretty bad -just snippets of things done before and simply rearranged along with a hollow, mechanical delivery. I saw her on a talk show recently. She was dressed all in tight black leather and naturally had to stick her butt in the camera and move it around seductively. Is this the extent of her art now? Desperately trying to prove that she's still sexy? Madonna, some people don't really care what you look like too much. Why not try something completely new . . . ? Like a video without you squirming and writhing about with pom poms or a dominatrix outfit? Is this what we'll be getting when she turns 60? This album is almost the antithesis of art. It's sad. I never considered her the greatest of musicians in any sense, but she's been apart of our culture for so long and has so much at her disposal that I expected something more. Somewhere in her tower of narcissism, she's lost perspective, and I think she took the wrong road with this one. I was hopingfor something \\"real\\" at this point. This just made me feel empty and hungry for something much deeper.

1609611543|4.0|When my Celiac disease was diagnosed ten years ago it was very difficult to find replacements for flour, which is easier today. Reading labels became crucial. Wheat, in many forms is in practically everything. People who don't understand what gluten is or the damage it can do sometimes roll their eyes as if I hopped on some bandwagon. Others insist that \\"artisan\\" bread or sourdough is superior. This book explains clearly the ramifications of hybridized wheat in the diet. After reading Wheat Belly, it is simpler to explain what gluten does. Better yet, I am buying extra copies for some chef friends.

B007G3H8Y0|4.0|There's no denying that Train has changed. Starting with \\"My Private Nation\\" the band has progressed from a simple college band to a more mainstream rock group, \\"Save Me San Francisco\\" was their reintroduction back to the masses. A great return and it shows they learned a few things on the way. \\"California 37\\" is in many ways a continuation. Familiar sounding tracks but taking it a few steps further. Much how drops was a continuation of Train. The opener 'Maybe this'll be my year' will remind many of billy Joel's 'we didn't start the fire', some would call it a sad rip off but i digress. It is a good solid opener.  Then we have 'bruises' a duet with the ashley monroe. Would probably hit big in the country charts with enough pop flavor to do decent on the POP charts. Very charming tune. Next is '50 ways to say goodbye' a flamenco infused quirky but fun driving rock tune.  I find myself leaving this on repeat because It's so infectious, and rather funny.  The title track is rather odd, a soft rap tune that for all purposes is a bit of an ego booster, and at the same time a small 'thank you' to their fans, and a promise they won't ever off course again. Mermaid smells of Enrique iglesias. Same Spanish style, quirky yet fun high energy song with a small ode to johnny depps famous pirate character. Makes me think the last pirates movie inspired this song. For those that get the itunes deluxe edition you get the song off the Taylor lautner movie Abduction, called 'to be loved' a typically rock movie single. Nice addition as that single can't be bought without buying the soundtrack.
B006X415GK|5.0|The black and white Frankie Stein that was made in limited quantities for San Diego's 2009 Comic Con were very popular.  So popular, in fact, that Hasbro has released this doll in \\"limited quantities\\" for a very low price ($4.13 at most big box stores).  She is NOT the same doll as the Comic Con collector's one, that is based off the original Frankie design, with the longer hair and the school girl outfit.<br /><br />HOWEVER, this is a beautiful doll, and worth picking up for your collection.  As the story goes, the beach has bleached the color right out of Frankie, so she appears in classic movie monster silver screen fashion - black and white.  The monochromatic design makes for an interesting and unique doll for your collection, and she is very attractive, with her sassy short haircut and beach ready attire.  Frankie is priced so low that if the kids break one, it's not the end of the world.  She comes in a very attractive black/white slim box, as the lower priced dolls do (Skull Shores, Gloom Beach).<br /><br />As with all Monster High dolls, the arms and hands become detached easily so care should be taken with play.  These are not dolls to roughhouse with.  My two girls are careful to play nicely but sometimes a hand does fall off (and is easily popped back on).  I have seen their friends' dolls that are sometimes just torsos, so a word of caution if this is to be a child's toy.  At a $4-5 price range for this particular one, it's not such a big deal.
B000001GQR|5.0|I don't have a musical background, but recently I decided to start collecting great orchestral works. So consider this review from someone learning to appreciate classical music.<br /><br />I have probably listened to Franz Schubert in the past either in church or on the radio, but this was the first time that I had knowingly listen to one of his works.  The whole of Symphony No.9 was a joy to listen to, though I particularly liked the first movement (Andante- Allegro ma non troppo) the best with its horns.<br /><br />I have listened to Haydn works before, and in the future I'm planning on collecting more recordings of his work, though not the Symphony No. 88.  This Haydn piece worked well with the Schubert because of how they contrasted in tone and intensity, but not in the skill in which they were composed.<br /><br />The orchestra that recorded these two pieces played them flawlessly so I could lose myself in the music as a result, not thinking about how some instrument sounded off.

B004LE7PCM|5.0|A classic. Great yarns that have stood the test of time and stand re-reading. Well written.<br /><br />Yes it is available for free elsewhere however paying the minuscule toll means its on every device I read using the kindle software at the page I last left - even if on a different machine.(desktop ultrabook ipad iphone kindle web or whatever) I can achieve that other ways but one needs to pay sometimes to maintain supplier interest and at 99 cents this is hardly gouging and by far the easiest way.

B000IOERBG|5.0|Synopsis: a historian, whose specialty is the Stalin era, goes to Moscow for a conference. There, he is accosted by an old man claiming to be Beria's former henchman and to have Stalin's secret diary; the old man disappears and is soon found dead. The historian goes searching for this missing diary, ultimately ending up in the city of Archangel, but what he slowly uncovers is a secret too bizarre for him. Through his search, he becomes associated with a megalomaniac, unprincipled, American journalist and the old man's daughter, who is a prostitute. At some point he realizes that he has been a catspaw all along.<br /><br />I read this book shortly after seeing the movie and both versions have some advantages over the other. The advantages of the book are as follows: in the book, you really get a feeling for just what a total scumbag is the journalist; he would get a big story even if it meant the deaths of innocents. The second advantage is that the characters in the book state that the girl has a screw loose; this is important because it explains why her last, climactic, act is so un-Russian. The third, and what I believe is the surprisingly strong, transcendental, theme of the book (which makes it much more than just a mundane mystery book): the book's theme hammers into the reader that one should pay attention to history, that it is not just a boring, academic, enterprise. One HAS to be aware of history because history has a nasty habit of turning around and biting you in the ass.

B0012IWHDW|3.0|Well this *is* a soundtrack, right?  A forgettable one at that (at least side one- side two is pretty decent).<br /><br />Feel free to disagree with my feelings concerning the opener \\"Main Title Theme\\" but I've heard several (hundreds) of instrumentals from the 70's, and the repetitive nature of this one comes up way WAY short.  It lacks substance and basically repeats the same generic western-style theme over and over without any imagination whatsoever.  Dylan desperately needed some vocals here.  I mean *badly*.  6 minutes of this is way too much.  It doesn't improve for the second track titled \\"Cantina Theme\\" either- even *more* repetitive, less exciting... and more aggravating.  A pointless instrumental.  It almost sounds like someone learning a guitar for the very first time and when he finally learns a melody, he just keeps playing the same few notes over and over.  That about sums up my feelings with this track.<br /><br />\\"Billy 1\\" is an improvement thanks to the harmonica and the short period of singing, but it's definitely no great shakes either.  It's still a weakly written and generic western theme with predictable notes that does nothing to excite me.  I can't believe Dylan fans think so highly of this stuff.  Isn't Dylan's voice and his creative lyrics the main appeal?  I enjoy his harmonica work too of course, but it fails to satisfy here.  It plays blandly on this track.  Dylan's voice on this track never ventures into any creative territory either- it just plays along rather soothingly and harmlessly with the music.  Boring!  \\"Bunkhouse Theme\\" is actually the best song so far- it's a quiet lullaby.  Still blandly written however, but it's a step in the right direction.<br /><br />\\"River Theme\\" is a short display of calm vocals that will surely remind you of \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\".  \\"Turkey Chase\\" is a decent song thanks to the speedy fiddles.  I actually really like this song.  I *could* complain that the song sort of pushes the fiddle aside asit moves forward, and that's a serious no-no in my book.  Don't disregard the best features!  \\"Final Theme\\" is a dramatic continuation of the theme from \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" with flutes and, believe it or not, a similarity to Mike Oldfield in the chorus.  Oh finally!  Some REAL Dylan singing!  \\"Billy 4\\" isn't really anything special neither lyrically or the vocal melody itself, but at least it's something to look forward to besides secondrate instrumentals.  I'm beginning to think Dylan's favorite word in the 70's was \\"Senorita\\" because he uses it again here!  \\"Billy 7\\" is all about that special Senorita.  Yes Dylan's favorite word is back once again!<br /><br />My question is, why did it take until the last two tracks for Dylan to come alive and start singing?  Alright so he sings briefly in a few other spots, but come on- it seems like NOW he's finally ready to grab the bull by the horns and deliver some vocals.  But... then it's over.  Oh well.<br /><br />Now I know why I normally avoid soundtracks- I actually feared Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid would sound more or less like this before listening to it and I was hoping my suspicions wouldn't be right.  Ugh!  At least side two -despite not providing anything that I admire Dylan's OTHER albums for- contains some pretty good instrumentals.  The instrumentals that take up side one leave a lot to be desired, truthfully.

B0079XNWQA|5.0|I like this new album by Jason Mraz. Love Is A Four Letter Word is a simple title for an album. It is an universal feeling that everyone  experiences. This is Jason's message with this album.  He sings well on every track.  My favorite song is \\"Frank D. Fixer\\".  This song is about Jason's grand dad.  This song is about all the things that Jason admires about his late grand dad .  He was  a person who could grow his own food and fix cars.  This song is about how much Jason values the spirit of hard work.  The harmonica playing on this track gives it a subtle distinct sound that makes it  My other favorite song is \\"Living In The Moment\\".  This song is about enjoying life and living in the present.  This song is a reminder that I need to forgive myself of my mistakes to truly enjoy life. \\"The Freedom Song\\" is a groovy jam.  This song is about the celebration of freedom.  I love the musical arrangementts.  I especially love the horns playing on this song.  \\"Everything Is Sound\\" is a similar song.  This is the kind of song that makes me grateful to be alive.  This tune puts me in a good mood.  \\"In Your Hands\\" is a beautiful song about missing that special someone.  This song is a reminder that I can be alone and not be lonely.  I love all of the sentiments Jason sings in this tune,  \\"Be Honest\\" is a simple laid tune.  This is a pretty song about how important honesty is in a relationship.  \\"I Won't Give Up\\" is another heart felt song.  This song is very touching.  \\"93 Million Miles\\" is a song that reminds me that home is a feeling as well as a physical place.  Jason sings that home can be any where a person feels comfortable.  I like the lyrics of this song a lot.  \\"5/6\\" is an unusual title for a song.  This song  smooth.  This song is about learning to make decisions with my heart instead of my head.  \\"The Woman I Love\\" is a song about loving someone with all of their faults.  I like this song a lot.  The piano playing sounds pleasant on this tune. \\"The World As I See It\\" is a love song about how a special person can change another person's outlook on life.  This is entertaining album of new music.t\\" is a love song about how a special person can change another person's outlook on life.  This is entertaining album of new music.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games was absolutely riveting from beginning to end. I fell in love with the characters and did not want the third book to end. A must read.
0439023513|5.0|This is the best book in the three for sure. Its a harder story actually, which is a bit odd considering the theme of the first two. All the characters still around have to deal with the things that have happen and then become part of something to fix all those things. Its not going to be easy for anyone and that is clear almost instantly.<br /><br />The theme seems darker in this book than the last two. It makes you think a lot and you are left to think about what else could have happened in the end outside what actually did happen. The book ends well, and there is a funny feeling about the ending at first but after some thought I can't think of a better way to draw this to a close. It was never going to be happily ever after for everyone and by the time the reader gets to book three this should be a well known fact.<br /><br />Those that are upset by this book must have thought happily ever after was the only way this could end. What makes this series feel real is the fact that isn't possible. Life lived as hard as the characters in this book had to live theirs leaves a mark, and this book does a great job showing how they deal with those marks and move forward.<br /><br />All three are must read books, this one is the best.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The title really didn't catch my interest at first, but I decided to give it a try considering all of the good reviews, and am I ever so glad that I did. While the first book or two can be slow moving, they are still interesting. Push through it and make sure you save the last three books for the weekend because you won't be able to stop for less important tasks like sleep and work! I also appreciate the special attention that is paid to proper grammar.  Most discount books are full of errors that really distract from the flow of the story, but this is fairly clean. I intend to buy out everything else this writer has put out, because writing this good will not stay cheap for long!
0143034901|4.0|Just finished reading the book yesterday and I can definitely say I was not expecting this type of a read. This novel will keep you wanting to read, especially if you want a book that thrills and has suspense. There is also a somewhat grey, mysterious feel to the story's setting. Some examples of this could be the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, the mystery as to why Carax's books are being sought after and burned by this faceless character, and also the unexpected situations when the characters are actually related to each other.<br /> To simplify the story, it starts off with the main character's father showing Daniel the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Basically, it is a collection of extremely rare books and Daniel chose a book from the collection. Daniel really enjoyed the book and wanted to search for more by the author Julian Carax, but then finds out that there might not be any more in existence. Someone out there has been finding all of the books and burning them. Daniel then goes out on a journey to find out more about this author and why their books are all being burned. He soon finds that his life is beginning to reflect that of the author of the book he has.<br /> I definitely would recommend this book for any serious reader. Especially a reader who is fond of suspense, thrill, and a little bit of romance. It is a bit hard to let go of the book. If you never get tired of reading, then this is the book for you.
B005GFPZYK|1.0|The title of my review sums it up. The flow is so fragmented to be laughable. The authors view on anything that doesn't fit into his pathetically narrow view of the world is a disgrace to the women and men who serve our country.

B005QBKXOQ|5.0|A friend sent this CD to me (via amazon) as a BD present and, to be honest, I wasn't expecting much. I have heard Daughtry and enjoyed what I heard before, but never thought enough of him to consider buying a CD.<br /><br />Well, this is one outstanding CD. Daughtry blew me away with the songs on this. I particularly enjoy 'Renegade' and 'Crawling Back to You' and 'Gone to Soon' is an emotional song that I can see becoming the anthem for people who have lost babies.<br /><br />I liked everything about this CD.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|It's been four years since this band debut with [[ASIN:B002FOQY2M Aim and Ignite]]. And as with most bands,they've evolved.Than again,so has American culture. No some things are still true. It's still a predominantly visual as opposed to aural pop culture. Also the economic situation,although better than it had been,is still in an uncertain state. A lot of people are simply uncertain. But it's a reality now.  Nate Ruess,Andrew Dost and Jack Antonoff may be technically a generation removed from me by a matter of a year or so. But they still faced the situation of entering their teens sometime in the 1990's. That meant that many young people didn't have the enormous challenges fast now or in past decades. So they wound up inventing things to contend with. That was the environment in which they entered puberty. By the time they grew up and began forming bands and such,the music world was in really sad shape frankly. This gave Fun./Nate Ruess in particular a lot of ground to cover in their music and lyrics to draw attention to their talents.<br /><br />  This album is quite a bit different than their first. Recorded during and/or following a tour opening for Janelle Monae this album maintains the melodicism of their debut but the production is much heavier,with more of an epic anthem flavor to most of the music.  This album is somewhat divided into halves,both interrelated but with some rhythmic differences. The title song,the hook laden \\"We Are Young\\",featuring backups by Monae herself,\\"Carry On\\" and the somewhat rocked up \\"It Get's Better\\" are very big,catchy pop anthems. They are easy to sing along to. But when you are,it's also easy to pick up that these lyrics actually deal with the virtue of self created challenges over genuine ones. Whether they be romantic,cultural or both in nature.  Being this is produced by Jeff Bhasker (known for producing epic minded hip hoppers Kanye West and Jay Z),this album concludes with epic tracks with somewhat more of an epic hip-hop beat to them. These start with \\"Why Am I The One\\",\\"All Alone\\",\\"All Alright\\",\\"One Foot\\" and the closer \\"Stars\\". This 6+ minute song is a journey through a series of different R&B/funk and new wave/dance rock style rhythms and melodies-pulling together all the influences they have.<br /><br />  After a second half that lyrically deals primarily with doubt and the letting go of fatalism,it closes with the band in a party rock state of mind on the bonus track \\"Out On The Town\\". The Fun. of this album have increased not only the ambitions of their arrangements. But their ambitions in terms of conceptualization as well. When they started out,their was a sense of almost abandon about them. While their lyrics still offered more somewhat more depth than a lot of contemporary pop/rock (indie or otherwise) did at that point,they were still talking of growing up and maturation to a degree. On this album,the band members have definitely grown up. The concerns are that of the present and the reality to come,not necessarily an imagined future. It's not a \\"darker\\" album,as would have been the cliche for this sort of recording. Rather it reflects on it's topics more with analyzation than anxiety. There's a strong amount of mature thought process here. Sometimes the music and lyrics boast and swagger. Other times their more resigned. Either way Fun. are still..fun.

B002FOQY2M|5.0|I only found out about this band since they opened for a Janelle Monae show that I attended last year. Being over amped by the presenter the bands sound interested me. I knew nothing about who they were,or their history. But the leader seemed to be a person with some history. Turns out I was right. It was Nate Ruess,originally lead singer of a band called The Format and now of this group. So I'll say this. I've kind of danced around new pop/rock groups for the last twenty years because,in some way they all seemed rather stuck in the same alt rock rut. Which,at least to me got very old fast. And that goes for much indie pop as well. This band on the other hand fascinated me. Something about the way the handle their music has a lot of strength and care put into it. From their sound to their approach,there's a lot for someone like me to appreciate.<br /><br />  For one this band is in the Jeff Lyne/Todd Rundgren/Queen-Freddie Mercury league of putting vocal harmonies,orchestrations and heavily constructed,melodic hooks over being mere \\"guitar heroes. The first six songs alone \\"Be Calm\\",Benson Hedges\\",\\"I Wanna Be One\\",\\"Light A Roman Candle With Me\\" and two special highlights in \\"All The Pretty Girls\\" and \\"At Least I'm Not As Sad (As I Used To Be) have this quality in spades. Very heavily crafted,melodic orchestral pop songs that are beautiful and actually address some of the tales of secret hopes that the emotional roller coaster of the 1990's tended to deny the human soul. Stories of puppy love,romance,awkwardness and simple joys dominate. \\"Walking The Dog\\" is a more danceable type number,showcasing a nice funk rhythm guitar like very much out of the Duran Duran school of pop/rock rhythm guitar.<br /><br />  \\"Barlights\\" has this great reverbed shuffle to it and \\"The Gambler\\" is a somewhat folk/rock styled story song that's very poignant actually. The album ends with the elongated 7+ Stones type blues/rocker \\"Take Your Time (Coming Home)\\",the longest and rockiest song on the album. And a very good album it is too. It's solid proof that a pop/rock record doesn't have to be juvenile,angsty or edgy to be successful in the modern world. There apparently is still room out their for a group of bands such as Fun. whose music flows directly from The Beatles,The Raspberries,ELO,Queen,Fleetwood Mac and just about every other rock band I can name that placed a strong emphasis on an arranged pop sound. Nate Ruess is a very talented singer/songwriter. Definitely comes across as a band oriented guy. But something about what I'm hearing and his enormous joy and enthusiasm I witnessed from him life tell me Fun. may have a future outside of Indie pop as well.n the album.

Waaaaay too touchy when you try to place or move something and you can very easily &quot; put away&quot; things without even realizing. When the squirrel rund across the screen, trying to hit him causes the entire scene to move.<br />Otherwise, LOVE the graphics and the gameplay keeps you interested, unlike others you need to just walk away from cuz you have to wait 2 days for a lumber mill to construct or a baby dino to hatch.

0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon was such an adventurous read! Its set in the mid 1900's Barcelona, with the main character growing up as you read this thriller through his eyes. Daniel Sempere was just a normal boy with an odd fascination to a book written by the mysterious Julian Carax. The entirety of the novel is spent with Daniel as he unravels and discovers what it meant to be Julian Carax and what it means to stand up for what you believe in. He meets friends like Fermin an ex secret service agent with a heart of gold and villains like the notorious Inspector Fumero is stuck forever hell bent in the past. All the character intertwine with each other mixing the past with the present, the present with the past, and even the past with the future. I spent a good week thinking I knew the outcome and finding that the next turn I came too in the novel lead me back to knowing nothing! The tale that Zafon tells is filled to the brim with suspense forbidden love, mystery, and a good chase. Everyone loves a good chase.<br /> Zafon writes The Shadow of the Wind in the first person, that being a sixteen year old boy. Now being a girl I strongly and geared to read novels from a woman's perspective, if it's in the first person, but I didn't feel that disconnect that I usually feel when reading from the male perspective. It must have been the eloquent, almost poetic language that was used throughout the novel. Zafon makes all these wonderful allusions to other movies, novels, and actors that help add this visual aid that bring the 3D to these marvelous characters. The novel has this `je ne sais quoi' about it that's almost magical, some call it magical realism. It's that feeling in the pit of your stomach when you as the main character witness something that you know is out of this world but it can't be. The book that Daniel receives describes a villain that haunts the characters in his book, and yet there he is outside of his window, that can be an example of this magical realism that you will encounter in the adventurous book. It was almost like I was watching a movie play out inside my head complete with a soundtrack and that on the edge of your chair feeling while Daniel is hot on the trails of the truth!<br />  The Shadow of the Wind has a little something for everyone. For the readers looking for love, albeit romantic drama, witty romance, or downright heart wrenching, this novel has it for you! Some like to have a good laugh or two when reading a lengthy book filled with turns and The Shadow of the Wind has just that with the character of Fermin and even the hero Daniel gets in a few witty remarks. Heck some people likes stories filled with turns and dark twisty things, it's got it. Haunted mansion, bad cop, star crossed lovers, unrequited love, getting that girl, being the hero, and a bright hopeful outcome. This book was just amazing I cried (sometimes out of frustrated anguish), cringed, and laughed. I am so happy that there are more novels to come in the world that Zafon has created. A book for everyone and anyone, why this isn't a movie? My guess would be that it's that vivid and amazing that it doesn't need a hot shot actor to dress up a paperback cover, it completely shines on it's own.s magical realism that you will encounter in the adventurous book.

B003F9G8B8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I have seen it before but I decided to rent it again since one of my sons plays rugby in high school.  It was a good movie to show that by putting some hard work into something and the result might surprise you.  Keep pressing on and don't give up.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is actually fun! I cant get enough. its easy and things keep happening things don't take forever!I love this game!!!
0439023491|4.0|The 74th Hunger Games are over and Katniss Everdeen is still alive.  Is it all smooth sailing and the plush life of a Victor from here on out?  Hardly.  Katniss's little stunt at the end of the games attracted all of the wrong kind of attention, including the personal attention of President Snow.<br /><br />Catching Fire is Suzanne Collin's is the able sequel to her dystopian YA novel, The Hunger Games.  It expands upon the sad-sack world we were shown in the first book, particularly its politics, but Catching Fire also returns to the Hunger Games well.  Why I think so many people like Catching Fire so much is exactly why I found it disappointing--it's more of the same, albeit better.  But the lack of originality outweighed how well it was done for me.  The Big Twist at the end is a bit too pat in my mind, but it does end with one heck of a Wham Line.<br /><br />Catching Fire is again told entirely in first person from the perspective of Katniss.  She is a highly imperfect protagonist, and this is a good thing.  The first person POV effectively frames Katniss's hypocrisy, as she quickly sees the mote in her companions' eyes and remains blind to the plank in her own.  She has an excuse to be a bit off-kilter.  She has a rare ability to throw gas on rebellious fire without little effort, and President Snow will go to any length to crush dissent.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Finally got to purchase this movie as well as Aladdin, such wonderful movies.  The kids are all so excited about the purchase as well, Both movies well worth the money spent.!
B003X5UDEW|5.0|I loved this movie, from beginning to end.<br /><br />First there was Bruce Lee, now we have Ip Man or Donnie Yen.  The action thriller not only tells the peril of the Japanese occupation in China but also the brutality of fighting and warring, which China has experienced for quite a long time.<br /><br />It is fun, touching, and a wonderful story about the art of Wing Chun.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|I heard such mixed reviews mainly negative concerning the \\"dark vs. light\\" tones of the movie. I found it not true. In fact some scenes are very lush and golden especially the last scene of Marlon Brando playing with his grandson in the garden. I didn't remember it being such in 1972 prints

B0000009SI|4.0|Frank Zappa - Apostrophe (1974)<br /><br />I generally dislike Zappa's music. And some of it I really can't stand (WE'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY, 200 MOTELS). It's loaded with childish humor and it seems to scream out, \\"look how clever I am!\\" which I find just really annoying. But he was an awesome guitarist and I actually love his SHUT UP AND PLAY YOUR GUITAR album in which he does exactly that. Zappa's killer guitar playing is featured on APOSTROPHE in places, such as the lightning fast soloing on \\"Nanook Rubs It\\" and the jazzy excursions on the title track instrumental. In fact, to give credit where it's due, the musicianship all over this album is pretty darn fantastic. It's sophisticated and very colorful, benefiting from a wide variety of instruments - various horns, vibes, piano, violin... The drumming is great too. And Zappa's vocals are really quite amusing here. The story of Nanook and the yellow snow is pretty stupid and I don't really pay attention to the words when I listen to this now (which is rare), but Zappa's intonations are funny. It's not my thing, but I actually rather enjoy this album if I'm in the right mood. I will always find his music to be obnoxious and self-indulgent and his sense of humor to be too juvenile and gross for my tastes (note the completely pointless fart at the 2:21 mark in \\"Nanook Rubs It.\\"). But it must be said that he was incredibly talented and he deserves credit for introducing humor into his music (even if I don't like it), something you don't hear very often.

B00786XVOG|5.0|International concert and artist Yanni and his orchestra demonstrate once again they are a leading team of the best musicians worldwide who are prepared to light up the night sky and take the world by storm. In the case of Yanni and the orchestra's recent live concert event at the historic El Morro fortress in Puerto Rico, the saying \\"take the world by storm\\" holds two meanings. The Oceanside concert venue of Castillo San Felipe del Morro citadel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, presented a challenge for the team by the inclement weather, typical for the historic El Morro coastal locality. It looked as if a miracle was the only hope for the final evening concert scheduled for Saturday night. As it turned out, a windswept atmosphere became a dramatic, silver lining for the ultimate Yanni concert experience.<br /><br />Yanni-Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico turned out to be an intensely glorious concert event for fans of the international concert artist Yanni, and his sensational orchestra, who are unquestionably, a quality group of the best artists worldwide. If you have ever had an opportunity to attend a live Yanni concert firsthand, or have watched a televised live PBS concert, then you know each and every concert performance is special, regardless of the venue or historical significance. For over 30 years, Yanni has made his presence known as a leading international concert artist with around one billion admirers. A single concert event, Yanni Live at the Acropolis is the top fundraising program for PBS, which had an astounding 500 million television viewers from 65 countries. The Taj Mahal in India and The Forbidden City in China concert are more examples where PBS viewership reached a television audience of 250 million people.<br /><br />One might consider Yanni a professional music entertainer, which is true, but only half of the story. There is intensity about Yanni that is profound. One can sense his genuine love of music, and the passion in which he brings inspiration to an audience every time. There is no doubt Yanni and his orchestra love to provide the concert of a lifetime for an audience, regardless of the concert location, or a venue's historical significance.<br /><br />Solos by the best artists worldwide are a central attraction during the Yanni-Live at El Morro concert, and every concert performance. It is hard to find the right words to express the quality with each vocalist, and the orchestra. Using adjectives like sensational and spectacular only partly define the superior excellence of the entire orchestra. Every member in Yanni's world-class orchestra give a performance that can only be described as stunning!<br /><br />Yanni-Live at El Morro concert opens with two songs from Yanni's newest album, Truth Of Touch (title song), then a boldly intense song from Truth Of Touch called Vertigo, with duel improvisational solos by Yanni and keyboardist Ming Freeman. Next song on the concert set list is The End Of August, a fan favorite piano and violin piece featuring Samvel Yervinyan and complete orchestral back up. The beautiful violin solo by Samvel Yervinyan is deeply moving, like the touching song that seems to hold new meaning, The Rain Must Fall. Yanni's wonderful piano performance precedes a dynamic bass guitar solo by Gabriel Vivas, and breathtaking violin solo by Mary Simpson.<br /><br />Felitsa is the song Yanni composed, and dedicated to his Mother Felitsa Chryssomallis. By design in composition, Felitsa is a poignant song with verses of piano and violin duet backed by full orchestra. It is a wonderful arrangement many recognize within the first few notes. The bold refrains of Voyage mark the return of another song from Truth Of Touch, which has stayed in the Top 10 Billboard Chart since released in 2011. Composed for the Hidden City concert in China, vocalist Lauren Jelencovich gives a stunning performance in Nightingale, in time with impromptu solos from orchestra members. Backed by keyboardist Ming Freeman,along with percussionists Yoel Del Sol and Charles Adams, harpist Victor Espinola gives the instrument with origins dating back to 500 BC, a contemporary makeover by his fiery playing technique during Harp Solo.<br /><br />Vocalists Lisa Lavie and Lauren Jelencovich amaze the audience with their duet and solo talents in Ode to Humanity, and during up-tempo, contemporary song Niki Nana, featuring brass specialists Dana Teboe on trombone and Jason Carder on trumpet.

I loved hearing Dylan speak about this period of his life, and really<br />make it sound like he was just doing his thing, and everyone else was making a big deal about a guy who was just living his life, and making music.<br /> Seems like everyone from Hendrix to the Beatles, to practically everyone else sights Dylan as an influence. Who am I to argue?<br /> I recomend this film, as well as the D.A. Pennybaker film \\"Don't look Back\\"<br />Maybe I'll even start buying some of his records, who knows?

It gives you a respect for science and a love for the beauty that reality has. This book should be on the bookshelf of every home and library. A child should be exposed to the right ideas. It is imperative that a child be exposed to these explanations early on so that it can pique his curiosity while giving him a love for learning about the world.<br /><br />The book is very big.

B000069HJN|5.0|This was Supertramp's release following the decent and underrated &#34;Famous Last Words&#34; from 1982. With the departure of co-founder Roger Hodgson, we were left to speculate about the future of Supertramp. The release of &#34;Brother Where You Bound&#34; in 1985, put those questions to rest for many. This is from start to finish, one phenomenal and amazing musical journey! At first, I too was hesitant. Like a lot of fans that were conditioned to continue to expect the same winning formula of their previous efforts. Over time, one can truly appreciate the direction Rick Davies was taking the band. We should have known from earlier songs like &#34;Bloody Well Right&#34;, &#34;Loverboy&#34;, &#34;Downstream&#34;, &#34;From Now On&#34;, the reflective &#34;Casual Conversations&#34;, and especially on &#34;Waiting So Long&#34;, what Rick Davies was capable of. On &#34;Brother Where You Bound&#34;, Supertramp created an album that epitomized all the anxiety and fear of the Cold War Era (which has been replaced by the &#34;War on Terror&#34; the same hoax by another name), and of its Orwellian implications for the whole world. From the opening jazzy/blues prog-rock of: &#34;Cannonball&#34;, &#34;Still In love&#34;, &#34;No Inbetween&#34;, the brilliant &#34;Better Days&#34; (this song speaks volumes about where we are today), to the phenomenal title track &#34;Brother Where You Bound&#34; (which had masterpiece written all over it), and to the beautiful and hopeful final track &#34;Ever Open Door&#34;. The band was simply on fire (Rick Davies, John Helliwell, Dougie Thomson, Bob Siebenberg), especially the guitar parts of Scott Gorham (Thin Lizzy) and of course the one and only David Gilmour. This album is now one of my all-time personal favorites!<br /><br />Love and Peace,<br />Carlos Romero

Dozens of books, games, coaches, seminars. . . This guy is a money making machine, so don't get too wrapped up in his dogma or you'll be out a few grand before you know it. Great advice such as:  things are only assets if they put money into your bank; and liabilities if they take money out. (like your house) A really phenomenal approach to money. The game is fun, but expensive. The computer version is really great. Be careful. It's a slippery slope!

The village residents do all they can to make him leave early because of the legend of the house. When Kipps discovers the secret he vows to stop it. I have to admit that I was looking forward to this movie mainly for the fact that this was \\"Harry Potter\\"'s first major non-potter movie. I was a little disappointed because of my high expectations. This is still a very good movie and there are some very very creepy things to keep you on your toes. I really just think that more could have been done with it. Some parts of the movie are very intense and keep you watching while others seem to drag and slow the movie down. The ending however really changes the way you feel and is a little shocking which to me made the movie better. I do recommend this one, but lower your expectations. Overall, a good movie with a great ending that is worth seeing. I give it a B.
0307951529|5.0|This is a great little book that will help you get over the hump and actually start a business. It focuses on the microbusiness revolution, which the author defines as \\"a way of earning a good living while crafting a life of independence and purpose.\\"<br /><br />This is full of great information, and if you have your own business or are interested, it is one you should definitely pick up. That said, here are some of the things I liked the most:<br /><br />* Six Steps To Get Started Right Now. This simple six-step process is contained on a couple of pages, and could be all you need to start selling something online.<br /><br />* Idea Matrix. Great way to evaluate competing ideas on impact, effort, profitability, and vision.<br /><br />* The Action Bias. All about focusing on the right thing, vitally important to any success in business.<br /><br />* The One-Page Business Plan. All you need to plan out your business.<br /><br />* Much more, from metrics you should keep track of to tweaking your bottom line, there is a ton of information across the business spectrum here.<br /><br />Lots of great things in this book, but there were a couple that I didn't like. First of all, though much of the information can be applied to any business, the author leaned towards talking about starting an infobusiness more than any other. Definitely worth picking up even if you aren't interested in starting an infobusiness, but I wish the cover matched the inside of the book more. I also found the chapter on How To Franchise Yourself not as helpful, did not seem to fit in the overall scheme of the book.<br /><br />Off the top of my head, this is one of the three best business books that I have read (the other two being [[ASIN:0307465357 The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich (Expanded and Updated)]] & [[ASIN:1591843529 The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business]]).

The plot keeps moving and the love interests ebb and flow like a great tide, yet are ultimately held together by the Sea itself.  Very touching. Honor, Duty, Love, Sacrifice. It's all there. You can't miss with this book. Right up there with The Godfather. Guys, you'll probably like this book too. The ending will make sense to you.

B0055SWM08|5.0|great puzzle experience, a ton of content, some easy some hard, just all around fun to play. worth every penny
0345522478|3.0|Overall I enjoyed this book. It was entertaining and fast-reading. There were some negatives, however.  There was not much in the way of character development - and some of the characters were inconsistent in their presentation. Frankly, many of them were *very* similar except for a few cosmetic differences. Also, the author has a tendency to have the characters repeat the same catchphrases frequently which, while probably truer to how people actually talk, can get a little irritating.<br /><br />There were disturbing hints of Gary Stu-ness in the main character, which leaves me a little leery of future books in this series (in my experience, once an author starts down that road it only gets worse).  Additionally, action at times came across as slightly contrived.<br /><br />That being said, I will be giving the second volume a read in the near future.  I did enjoy the concept of all the gods from various religions running around causing havoc.  And there were a couple characters that showed a lot of promise - hopefully as the author gets more comfortable with them they settle a bit more and fulfill said promise.  All-in-all the book was a nice, no-thinking-required escape for a couple hours.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this book initially to just get everyone off my back about reading it. I wanted to see what the fuss was all about. I thought it was a little slow to get into, I had to really make myself read it. Once they actually got into the arena it was a quick read. I really likes it, and I'm sure I'll be reading the next 2 books in the series.
0741470314|5.0|5 Stars  --  The best biography that I have read in recent times.<br /><br />Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy presents a really comprehensive picture of who Michael Jackson was as a real person, father, entertainer, humanitarian, son and brother, friend, and global inspiration.  I had no idea about so many things that Dr. Moriarty reveals in this book.  It was eye-opening.  When I finished, somewhat emotional, I had developed a real feeling about this special man -- who he was and what he accomplished.  Inspiring.
0439023491|5.0|I just finished the book a few moments ago and my jaw is still dropped. Each chapter pretty much ended on a suspenseful cliff hanger which made keep reading for more; each cliff hanger better than the previous. It really got interesting when the Quarter Quell began thats when I read faster on. The last chapter really takes it all though...I purchased Book three \\"Mockingjay\\" before I finished the last few chapters of this book. Great read....
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game is fun and interesting. the levels are all sweet and all little challenging. the point of the is to help out families; I think that is agreat way to learn.

B007G3H8Y0|4.0|The rock band Train is back with the long awaited CD release titled 'California 37' . It's not always easy to follow-up on a great release like the multi-platinum 2009 album release 'Save Me, San Francisco' : with its hits including the title track as well as \\"Hey, Soul Sister\\" (Grammy Award Winner & crowd's favourite), \\"I Got You\\" & \\"If It's Love\\" among others. The new CD (11 tracks) sees the band using their well proven formula of the past (unmistaken wonderful lead vocals by Pat Monahan & memorable melodies in the stand-outs/gems/solid tracks in \\"Feels Good At First\\", \\"We Were Made For This\\" & \\"When The Frog Rolls In\\") as well as an introduction of some 'trendy rappy' vocals (breaking new ground so to speak) in the great tracks \\"This 'll Be My Year\\", \\"Drive By\\" & the okay title track \\"California 37\\" and an emphasis on strong harmonies in this CD as compared to the past. This breaking new ground may not please everyone but many musicians & bands like 'to move on'. One hopes many fans are taken successfully on board in this 'new endevour/breaking new ground' in this 'new Train'. Great tracks include \\"Bruises\\" (featuring Ashley Monroe), \\"You Can Finally Meet My Mom\\", \\"Sing Together\\" (beautiful banjo sound & harmonies) & \\"Mermaid\\".<br /><br />On overall, the band Train had a high mountain to climb in releasing a follow-up to the multi-platinum 2009 album 'Save Me, San Francisco'; but may they have surprisingly managed to do so in this new CD 'California 37' that sees them 'changing direction'. I give the band Train a 3,5 stars in this new CD release. A recommended CD listening.
B001EBWING|5.0|This is one of the best films and the actors as well as the film are classics and will be viewed as very good for all times.
0439023513|5.0|As with any series, the plot thickens and gradually gets \\"darker\\". That is exactly what you can expect of this as well. I literally finished this third and final book yesterday and can honestly say this series has literally consumed me (and the rest of my family) for the past few weeks. I was happy with the ending...it's kind of what I anticipated, but non-the-less a great ending for a superb story! Looking forward to more of Suzanne Collins brilliant work!
0061992860|5.0|This book is definitely a pocket size book. The image size is almost the life size. Personally I love that. I can throw the book in my back and it doesn't take up any needed space. It is has an amazing amount of information, as the book is almost as lick as it is long or wide. If you have decent vision there is no need for the book-size version.
B000001GY9|4.0|Bernstein is a conductor like no other and the Vienna Phil has Schumann in its blood.  There's good reason to expect great things from musicians of this caliber and the Schumann symphonies are always a joy to hear.  My ideal Schumann performance is at once lyrical, intense, and spontaneous, finding the balance between introspection and extroversion.  I'm not opposed to other outlooks so my main concern coming to this disc was that Bernstein would be able to fully commit himself to the scores, adding insight that adds to their greatness.<br /><br />I hadn't listened to the set long before it was apparent that Bernstein wasn't going to fit my aforementioned desires in Schumann.  He is going for unabashed introspection.  CD covers don't tell everything, but the picture of Bernstein soberly bowing his head goes right along with his viewpoint.  Everything is intense, with deep feelings on every page.  What's missing is Schumann's glorious sense of freedom.  The music throbs with emotion, but it's dark emotion, not sunny lyricism.  Did Bernstein chose the Schumann symphonies as a vehicle to express his most secret regrets?<br /><br />I'm not sure what caused Bernstein to view these symphonies so darkly.  It's troubling, often causing impatience from the listener.  Yet it's painfully heartfelt.  Bernstein knew full well what he was doing and he wants us to understand his outlook.  He's consistent throughout, always making sure there are plenty of clouds on the horizon, if he ever lets the sun come out at all.  Often the line seems weighty; some will find it ponderous.  Bernstein does let the music take off however; there are moments of great excitement.  Yet even in those moments the undercurrent is gloomy.  I sense an effort hide depression through movement and brute force.  Again, it's moving, but ultimately troubling.  Many won't be able to tolerate the absence of Schumann's usual sunny romanticism.  I'm torn between dismissing the set for lacking everything desirous in Schumann and praising it for its emotional impact, which is tremendous.<br /><br />No matter what side you find yourself on, it's undeniable that Bernstein sees meaning in these symphonies.  The Vienna Phil plays as rapturously as you would expect.  Just be prepared for Bernstein's most somber of ideas.Schumann and praising it for its emotional impact, which is tremendous.<br /><br />No matter what side you find yourself on, it's undeniable that Bernstein sees meaning in these symphonies.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this app and it works just fine on my kindle fire. Try the serpent game. I love it! The games may be simple but they are fun. As long as you have time to do them you should get this app.
0439023521|5.0|Five stars all across the board! Loved it, the plot, the setting the characters...everything! Just finished the third in the series MockingJay. This series has literally passed through our house like a case of the flu. Pick it up and give it a try- you won't be sorry.
B001R60ESE|5.0|Chris has always surrounded himself with some of the greatest musicians on the planet.  Starting with his touring band, Billy Childs, Billy Kilson and Mark Whitfield are second to none. They have an opportunity to shine on popular but classic tunes such as \\"When I Fall In Love\\", to \\"Flamenco Sketches\\" a Miles Davis number from \\"Kind of Blue\\" album...simply outstanding. Add the Boston Pops and such iconic voices as Sting, Josh Groban, and even Steven Tyler...really?...but it works! There are wonderfully written arrangements allowing Chris to artistically play off his guest instrumentalists such as Yo Yo Ma and Lucia Micarelli.  The sound engineers did a masterful job mixing and recording the event. Displayed on your big screen TV and sent through your stereo you will experience a concert that you wish continued beyond the 120 minute playing time.
B000RD0RDU|5.0|Reliable and quiet, trade of is it's not that powerful but it moves enough air to keep 10 Watts worth of high powered LEDs cooled (with a decent sized heat sink) been running 24/7 for three weeks at 100%, all five are still whisper quiet, so no complaints from me at this point. Power cable length may be a little short for some uses (~3 inches), but for me it was just barely what I needed, which I much prefer over sloppy long wires everywhere. I will very likely buy this fan again. (Wish Scythe sold a 40mm 5v model)
B0049M7BDE|5.0|The disks were delivered as promised.<br />This is one of my favotie movies. It is a remake that is much better than original.<br />It is fun to watch and I would sure recommend this film.
0439023491|5.0|Here again another 5 star rating. It's hard to read a \\"middle\\" book and feel as good about it as you did the first. In this case, I have felt just that. Let me say first that I enjoyed The Hunger Games a wee bit more. However, as a second middle book this one was equally as strong and provided the right amount of twists to keep it interesting. As I stated in my review of The Hunger Games...pick this one up and give it a try...you won't be sorry!
B004I744AS|5.0|One of the best apps around.  I found the interface easy to use, and the ability to do instant translations is a big bonus.  The extras included with this app make it a real winner.
0312997221|5.0|Avenger was my second of this author's titles. And I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The novel's flow is non linear as a lot of reference is made to the past. This helped to sustain my interest as the unfolding details added to the suspense.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed Dexter's ability to constantly remain ahead of the challenges thrown his way.<br /><br />A minor draw back while reading this were few repitions I recognized from another of the author's titles. At other instances, I also found detailed descriptions a bit distracting as I was eager to get on with the storyline.<br /><br />Overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyed read.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1463694261 Repositioned: The Journey]]
0439023513|4.0|After devouring the first two installments of the Hunger Games trilogy, I was eager to read Mockingjay and see how the author ended the story of Katniss and the revolution of the districts. The sense of closure comes toward the end of the book - but it's a gruesome and at times, difficult to read story. I almost had to put the book down at one point because I was tired of reading about people getting attcked, injured and dying. Overall this is a fitting final chapter, but I could have done with a bit less bloodshed.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|This is a worthy successor to Andrew Lloyd Webber's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, and deserves the new-found praise that is being heaped upon the reworked Australian production. LOVE NEVER DIES is a complex work that will challenge long-time fans of the original, but rewards those who approach it with an open mind. As for the music and performances, Ben Lewis' star making turn as the Phantom is a thing of wonder to behold, as he weaves a spell of obsession and melancholy, second only to Michael Crawford in this reviewer's opinion. The rest of the cast is wonderful as well, bringing life to Lloyd Webber's best score since the original PHANTOM. The staging and direction by the all-Aussie crew is outstanding, giving Broadway a run for its money. HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|The game is very cute and fun. Looks and plays like Mario Bros, which my kids love. The controls are a bit tricky for smaller hands, but its manageable. Like it a lot.
B005QJZ5FA|2.0|i have been hearing all the hype over her and i said i will listen and just chill and what i heard was a one note act with pretty much one long song and no changes and no feelings.  i found this album to be predictable and no emotion. the arrangements and that dark cold feel is why its at least an ok album, however based on the vocals and the overall music on the album, not much to get excited about. i've seen her perform on tv and after each performance i would check my glass to make sure i didn't drink the wrong thing and since i only drink water well it wasn't me that felt off.
0060930349|5.0|Long ago,some wag said that prolific author Isaac Asimov was writing \\"Asimov's History of Everything.\\" One gets the feeling that Historian Paul Johnson could write that book too. He knows a staggering amount of information not only about American history but about history in general. Plus, it is so refreshing to read a volume by a writer who is not anti-American or, alas, politically correct. If Johnson has any bias, it's pro-American, and that's rare today. But when you combine his staggering intellect and his breezy, informative way of writing, the result is a great history book. There are some (minor) flaws in the book but, all in all, a fascinating read. Don't pass it up.
B0042ESTQW|5.0|I bought this one for my new Edge 800. It fits it very well and protects the unit. I have some trouble with the part that covers the USB connector. It is a little hard to put it in place. Good product.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is so amazing I cant stop playing it you will love it its good for kids and adults! !!!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is the best I've. ever played the missions are easy and fun and your energy recharges every two minutes. its wonderful I say get that game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game it is super cute. really easy to figure out you don't have to read any instructions. and its something that you have to work on and keep playing so it is a long term game. but its not like super frustrating like most of the games that you have to wait to advance they make you wait for ever. the longest you have to wait to complete a mission is only 24 hours. so I would definitely reccomend this game for all ages and boys and girls
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have avast installed on all of my Pc systems and two kindles. it has never had an issue and I tell my friends about it.
0393080269|5.0|This is quite the book to read both for seasoned investors and common people. Global economic order is undergoing rapid change. Ruchir Sharma is best placed to tell us what the future holds. Long-held views about so-called emerging markets no longer hold good, according to him. if anyone knows the subject, he ought to be the one, considering he is among the world's most prominent emerging market investors. He tells us his views in the simplest possible manner and his writing reveals his deep insight into the wheels that turn the developing nations of the world. A must-read for all. In one word: Unputdownable.

B007PTJOV0|2.0|it good but every time you die,  you have to start at the very beginning no matter where you are...
B004YKSXYW|5.0|Came across this book by chance while following a certain blogger.<br />Wow! It's so great to go through our entire History, in a simple, concise and quick way.<br />Also, for the ones like me, not paying so much attention @ school, it makes me feel like I'm able to turn back the clock and take back those lost years when I should have been paying attention.<br />Also as the father of two young boys (3yrs old+ 1month old) this book gives you great ammunition as a father to be able to explain stuff, like the pyramids and all sort of ancient history!<br />I strongly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a great read but also who wants to learn stuff at the same time.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love it it should be #1 on the apps it is so good I am not liying. get it now
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an insightful and creative novel, frought with the battle of emotion, strategy and survival. The war between survival and the connection of all human beings is exposed and read like an open wound, dying to heal.
1741798981|5.0|The lonely planet series is one of the best in my opinion.  Its London travel guide doesn't disappoint.  There's walking guides for different areas of London.  There's history and introduction about London today.  There's the underground survival ground.  Everything is just lovely, as the British would say.  Enjoy this little gem with you while you explore London.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Good acting, great costumes and scenery...and most of all, accurate to the book series. I highly recommend reading the series first if you want to catch everything that's going on politically (but you could also pay close attention to the dialogue, too, I guess). If you like history and fantasy, you'll love this series!

B002C6A6N6|4.0|I loved going through all the dvds and reminiscing about watching it when I was a child. The only problem I had was one of the dvds had a scratch on it so I couldn't see two episodes... Other than that it was great.
082300659X|2.0|I first want to state that this is a phenomenal drawing book and deserves 5+ stars.  However....I purchased the new kindle ebook that is supposed to come with video and audio.  Well.....the book pages with text and illustration are gorgeous.  Disappointingly, not one of the videos shows up on either my iPad or kindle fire.  In lieu of a video, there is a message that states that my device does not support this book's videos.  Don't you love it?  I contacted amazon.con who told me this was an audible.com book (I don't have an audible account and--anyway--I went to audible.com to see it this book was available there.  It wasn't!?  I consequently refunded the ebook edition of Ms. Aristide's drawing book.  I do think I shall repurchase it in the hardcover edition, though, as it comes with a DVD that I know will work.  A streaming video would have been great..... (sigh)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Well written easy fast reading with both emotion and action. Outstanding! I highly recommend this Trilogy.<br />PS:  Read the book before seeing the film.
B005P06AAO|5.0|I followed the first season on MTV and wanted to watch it again and get one of my friends to watch it as well. Good quality. I have nothing bad to say about the DVD for the series.
B002A97IJ0|3.0|My video card prevents me from having a full size 120mm fan on the side of my case but this fan fits perfectly. The screws were too short so I had to use normal size fan screws. The big drawback and my reason for giving it 3/5 stars is the noise it makes. I like having a low noise system and this fan makes more noise than all 3 fans in my PC put together. I tried a DIY fan speed controller but this thing is still very loud.<br /><br />If you're looking for a thin fan, this might just work for you. But if you're looking for a thin, silent fan I wouldn't buy this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game. lots of stuff to do. its a never ending adventure. you can't miss out on this one folks.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good addictive game add me ad your Neighbor stephanie79. the more friends/ Neighbors you have, the better.Not really like the original one but I like it
B00753MBHA|5.0|I thought \\"Blood On the Nation\\" was their best work since \\"Balls To The Wall\\" and this latest shows it wasn't a fluke! Now, not only do we have great solo music from UDO bit also can enjoy the rise of Accept but they seem to have dialed it back to the formula and style of their strongest era!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|It's great to come back to these stories. There's something about Sherlock Holmes that is so competent, and interesting, and mysterious. And the atmosphere is amazing too. I'm totally pulled into another time and place. If you haven't read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle yet, you just have to! And if you have, go back and do it again. It's like a visit from an old friend.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a good time waster for something just to do. It would be nice if you could increase your energy a little faster and didn't have to pay for the dollars. Also, it is annoying when you are close to something and then everything resets itself to being done 2 days away when it should only take a few minutes. That is getting annoying to have to deal with.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a well designed app that has very smooth, high quality graphics.  It also has pleasant sounds and lots of variety in the puzzle obstacles and strategies needed to solve each level.  It has a good mix of relatively easy and then very difficult levels.  Lots of fun.  Not easy to master but keeps you engaged.  One of the best apps on the market.  I highly recommend it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I received a blurp of \\"Catching Fire\\" on my phone & then I couldn't wait to order it to read on my phone & computer. I am not a person who stays up untill 3:00am for any reason, but I just couldn't put it down. It is a very well written story of suspense, & intrique interwoven with a bit of mystery & romance. Not to much for the guys, but just enough for the ladies. I then purchased the other two books in the series which were just as good as this one. I saw the movie of the first one with my niece & told her she needed to read the books as there is so much more to the story then the movie can tell. She did & called to say \\"Thanks! I stayed up untill 5:00am reading!\\" She loved them also. Great read, with a lesson to teach for those willing to see it.
0345803507|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy I must say was beautiful. I read so many reviews that said it was garbage or it was really good. So I took a chance and read the trilogy.<br /><br />Heroine: Anastasia -strong willed, with a heart of gold for her \\"fifty\\". A woman put in this story that can handle anything that comes her way and stand by her man's side no matter what he does or says.<br /><br />Christian: Mr. Fifty Shades - is sexy, charming, witty, and of course so screwed up until Ana walks into his life.<br /><br />This trilogy to me touched my heart in that it was the basic fundamentals of a love story. It touches your human aspect in a reality based way.  From the emails between Christian and Ana, I do that with my partner the truth always comes out in emails rather than face to face. In the emails you get to see how they communicate and their love develops for one another.  The humor, anger, and despair they both experience.<br /><br />I have seen some reviews in regards to the switching back and forth with Ana and her \\"inner goddess\\"  all I can say is how many times have you done that with yourself. This is what makes Ana so relate-able and the story so realistic I can hear my own subconscious doing the exact same thing so many times throughout this story.<br /><br />You have a love story of a small town girl who meets her knight in shining armor except he is all kinds of screwed up.  The BDSM in the book unless you are an expert was hot.  The sex is hot, the love, is hot, and the romance is beautiful. This author did a good job of making a romance a romance in her own right but drawing the reader in and making it realistic.  So much that you can say I could be Ana or I could be Christian.<br /><br />This trilogy gives you moments of intense humor, moments where your heart will bleed for the characters, and moments where you experience the most joy for the growth and maturity of this couple.<br /><br />Simply put a Romance of the Century.  Must read love story without all the garbage.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|I was wondering how the story we all know could be contracted into a two hour movie, well it can't be done.<br />I braced myself for a disappointment after reading the reviews, was hoping for a strong performance by Gary Oldman, it was not to be.<br /> I would loved to have been a fly on the wall when Oldman and Co. saw the final release version, I'm sure that would have been interesting.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I have been a Nicholas Sparks fan from the very beginning.  He has such a distinct writing ability, and The Lucky One is just one more on his list of excellent works.  This story takes you to a place where most men/women in the military don't let you go.  Inside their head and inside their heart.  I was a huge fan of Logan's from the beginning.  Without spoiling it, all I can say is a HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading this book.<br /><br />5-STARS*****
B006QS07IK|3.0|It's a good purchase but the quality of the book worries me. The glue along the binding is already breaking off and separating from the book. The book mark ribbon is too delicate and cheap. The gold on the page edges makes pages stick and is poorly done and the \\"leather\\" covering is cheap.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|Love the show and it was great to be able to see the season at my own pace.  My only problem is that we can only see it one time and then it expires.  That bothers me.  Suppose I want to see it again?  I'm not paying again to see it.  Or am I mistaken???
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Reviewed by my teen-age daughter:<br /><br />This was the best book I've ever read! I cried in some parts, and laughed in others! I love how you can be crying then you can laugh right after! This book, for me, was better than all of the Twilight and Harry Potter books, and that's something if you're comparing it to those books. I could literally read this book a million times and still be completely into it. This book never bores you. From the first page on I couldn't put it down. I was intrigued from the very beginning. I can't wait until I finish the second book!!
B006903GX8|3.0|This book (The World of Downton Abbey) does not translate well to kindle.  It has a lot of pictures than kindle does not show well.  The content is interesting.  I would rather have the hard copy.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Kate is AWESOME, the action and plot and well planned and laid-out. The final scene where Michael is seen outside his glass chamber, his daughter seeing through his eyes, sets up for the next in this series.<br /><br />Outstanding sets with a real plot, get this one !

B000T12J8Q|5.0|I am a grown man and this movie speaks of what goes on in a Man's heart, this movie displays how a Man who led a rather successful but unfulfilling life in terms of something that was missing but he didn't know it.  And when it hit him, it took him down a road he would never imagine, one filled with passion and love.  Yet it is one of pain and loss, he loses everything and deep in himself reveals a side of him he would have never imagined, one that will stop at nothing for revenge and this leads to the end of film.  All I can say without spoiling is I am one who is very difficult to bring to tears to say the least but each time I see the end thats whats happens because of all of the emotions Kevin and Madeline convey perfectly come to such a tragic but beautiful end.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I got this book out of curiosity, and base on some reviews here. Once I started reading it I could not. Put it down. I killed the book in 4 days and now I'm on the second book.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I enjoy this very much with one exception.  Is there a volume control in app?  I have my Kindle volume all the way up and it is difficult to hear some times.  If not please update with one.  5 stars either way.  Fun to watch and experiment with the different notes.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|My wife and I played this for a while then it got buggy. 209 hours for food from a pig when it should be like 10 min. Fun at first, but then on my kindle and my wife's all the production times went to 200 + hours. that ruins the fun.

044024630X|3.0|All American action hero Jack Reacher returns for the sixteenth time in Lee Child's award-winning mystery / suspense series. This time around, Reacher is not a former Army MP traveling around the country carrying only his toothbrush and an ATM card. Instead, \\"The Affair\\" provides us with the back story of Reacher's last assignment in the Army. Even though he's now taking orders (or at least pretending to take orders), he still lives by his own rules.<br /><br />Like most of the series, the action takes place in the middle of nowhere, in this case, Carter Crossing, a rural town in Mississippi. Reacher has been ordered to find out if anyone at the local Army base is involved in the murder of a young woman. Although he's operating undercover, the local sheriff, Elizabeth Devereax, an ex Marine, immediately figures out that Reacher is an Army investigator.<br /><br />Sticking to the formula, what would a Jack Reacher novel be without the obligatory scene where he single-handedly subdues four (or maybe it was five or six) assailants, while describing his fighting strategies in exact detail? On the other hand, Child throws in a few new plot twists to keep the reader guessing and his commentary on life is always interesting. When Reacher asks Devereax when she stopped enjoying being a Marine, she replies, \\"For years you've laughed off the small things, but they come so thick and fast that eventually you realize that an avalanche is made up of small things. Snowflakes, right? .... Suddenly you realize that small things are big things.\\" The question is, do the book's many small flaws become an avalanche? Probably not, but there's enough so that \\"The Affair\\" will please only the most devoted Reacher fans.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|this is a classic.  honestly i had never watched the halloween movie all the way through til i got the dvd. i must say, this is an awesome slasher film. i cant stop watching it
B002L6I9Z4|3.0|I bought this because my 3yr old son loves Lego.  The camera is durable, he loves to play with it and look at the pictures.  He is only 3 so the pictures arent that great.  I only gave it 3 stars (and I'm being generous)because the picture quality is NOT GOOD AT ALL.  When you delete a picture it takes you back to the first picture so you need to scroll through or download to delete pictures.  Not very functional.  However, my son loves the camera which is why I bought it in the first place.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very fun and challenging. I recommend this if you enjoy puzzlers. The music is relaxing do it's a good way to relax too!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I rarely comment in online stores, but this book (the Wool Omnibus) just demanded praise.  The writing is clean, the characters are *real*, the story compelling.  The writing reminds me of Bradbury--there's an almost ethereal quality to it, something you can't quite grasp but feel woven into the book.  I'd go on, but the book's already kept me up until 2am.  Great job, and I look forward to reading more from Mr. Howey.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love it I'm glad its free . I get mad wen I loose energy. oh well either way its the best wooo
0345803485|1.0|First, let me say that I am not in any way a prude.  I was not offended by the subject matter of the story at all.  There is much, much better erotica out there to read if that is what you are looking for.  This story was just very poorly written and completely unbelievable.  No super fabulous executive is going to fall for a scrungy looking shy college student.  And definitely not going to fall in love with her.  The main character has the emotional maturity of a 13 year old.  I got so sick of this stupid character saying \\"holy crap.\\"  Really?  Is that the best the writer can do?  If you want some good erotica then buy something in that genre where the writers know what they are doing and write for adults.  Some of their stories are even not bad in addition to the sex scenes.  The fact that suburban women are apparently sitting around reading this awful book acting like it is something \\"new\\" is ridiculous.  People have been having these types of sexual relationships for hundreds, probably thousands of years.  There might have been some hope for this little tale if the underlying story had had even a scintilla of believability.  It should not surprise you that this began as Twilight fanfic.  It is the worst of the genre.  Someone, please tie the author's hands so she cannot write any more such awful stories.  And while you are at it, duct tape her mouth, too.

It works flawlessly through my wifi. If only it had to option to actually turn the computer on or wake it from sleep. Other than that, it's the best investment I've made in an app.

B000HC2LI0|1.0|I love this series and bought 2, one for my Dad.  After about a year my discs stopped reading!!!  Some of his too!!  We just about have a whole collection between us.  They wear out too late for amazon's return policy.  BEWARE!!
0439023521|1.0|There I said it.  I am not in the demographic age group that this book was aimed, so maybe that's why I found it to be poorly written and boring.  I read it because I did notice readers above the 20 somethings were raving about it and wanted to see for myself.  Let me take that back, I did not \\"read\\" it, I skimmed over it because it never caught my attention.  I tried hard to get interested in it, stopped and actually read a whole page here and there.  If I didn't know better I would have thought it was written by a 14 year old girl and and not very well.<br />There must be some type of msg sprinkled over it to get so many people excited about it.  Most likely it is a success story for pure marketing.  Throw something out there enough, pump it up and and anything seems exciting.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I love this game when its working. it crashes a lot and now everything is waiting 106hours. so now I have to remove the whole game :(
B004UID2LC|1.0|I can watch the youtube videos but for some reason they do not 'Download as Video'.  When I try as any other type they download but do not play.  In addition, when you go to watch a video, instead of the one you pick, the app will replay the last one, not play the current one.<br /><br />I gave it one star because it let's me watch videos.  All in all, not a very good app.  Not even for free.
B006G2124E|1.0|I don't want to watch it on the computer, I want the DVD to carry with me whenever I want it, not set on the computer and watch it in the small screen! But you as soon as you ask for it you put this service instead of give us (the costumers) the opportunity to verify if we really want this instead of a real DVD in our hand!
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|This is a no-pretense album, designed to do one thing and one thing only--give you a good time.  The doing of this takes some rather interesting turns.  The album opens with a \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\"-like-timeline of recent events, ending in a touching recounting of a first kiss, and a rousing chorus.  You've probably heard \\"Drive By\\" by now, but if you haven't, it is an uptempo emotional tune couched in a singalong chorus--\\"I swear for you/I'll be there for you/this is not a drive by\\".  50 ways to say goodbye opens with a flamenco like figure including a trumpet line, and provides a nice showcase for some over the top singing, before it segues into a country flavored rocker, and it says a lot that these two sections are made to meld together with believability.  The best part of the song is the emotional bridge, which has a passionate and soulful \\"I want to live a thousand lives with you/I want to be the one you're dying to love/ but you don't want to\\" over a catchy beat.  There are gentle moments here as well: \\"We Were Made for This\\" is a tribute to the surprise and pleasures of true love sung over a chiming guitar, slowly building to a climax.  In all, this is a worthy successor to \\"Save Me, San Francisco\\", drenched in guitar and California sunshine, leavened with heartbreak and love.  It's just plain-ole good summer music, perfect for your trip down the PCH.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Dang this is so good!!!  Saw them/him on SNL recently and was blown away by the sound.  Reminds me of Beck.  Most of the songs on this album are strong, there's not much filler.  Gets better with repeat listens.  Highly recommend.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love this game!!!! Hours of fun. Every time you play you get to do something new. Even my husband likes this game.
B006ZCWTV0|4.0|Dear God, thank you for Bruce Springsteen.  While others are making forgettable pop albums and reveling in childish theatrics (Katie Perry, Lady Gaga, Madonna) there is one uber icon who is still keepin it real for those with a small or no voice.  BRUCE!  Love this album, it is powerful and ultimately gives me hope for a better future for the US of A.  Thank you Bruce.  Rock on, bro!
B0061S0A64|5.0|I don't like to write reviews but this app different. its so unique and fun and creative and just overall well made. definitely worth downloading. and is especially great on the kindle fire
0061122416|4.0|This book is very well written. It has a lot of references to God, but despite that the story is amazing. It's exciting, action packed, and it's just uplifting. The young man in the story is quite intelligent and his story is beautifully written by the author.
B005HSL626|5.0|Whats with people and ads? Hello? There is a paid ad free version! Just reminding. Anyhow, I really love this game! xD
B007IXWL2C|3.0|So I'm going to start off by saying that overall I kinda enjoyed the series and I honestly have to say I had a love/hate relationship the whole time I read it. This is the first real romance novel I've read other than the twilight series. The first book completely sucked me in with the growing romance between Christian and Ana. However, I did find myself chuckling multiple times throughout the book with the word choices the author used, Ana's inner goddess and the, \\"Oh my....\\" crap. It was kinda over the top.<br /><br />Essentially when reading this book I realized the author wrote this as every girl's fantasy. Ana is beautiful/stunning but doesn't realize her own beauty but it seems like almost every guy wants her. She is innocent and somehow manages to capture the heart of a seriously gorgeous, rich guy who is absolutely AMAZING in bed, all within 3-4 months (crazy!). Oh, and they have kids and live happily ever after. This is a little unrealistic but then I keep reminding myself, it's fiction.<br /><br />Overall, I struggled with Ana's character. She was sometimes annoying as she would stand up to Christian but immediately back down from her convictions just because he looked at her certain way. I was also disturbed that the couple used sex as a coping mechanism but hey, I guess if the sex is that good, maybe it's worth it! ;-)<br /><br />Just like other reviewers said, so much repetition and by the third book, I no longer cared about the sex scenes (too much of them) and just wanted to see how the rest of the story developed. Although there weren't many surprises in the book, I did find myself enjoying it once the pivotal moment in the story happened, i.e. the kidnapping. I enjoyed finding out more of Christian's back story and realized my favorite part was the epilogue that he narrates.<br /><br />I had my ups and downs with book 3 (and book 2) and wanted to give up on it multiple times but in the end, I'm glad I stuck it out. I'm giving it only three stars because just like Ana, I found myself rolling my eyes multiple times. Just too much repetition with word choice, the plot still involved a stalker just at a slightly higher level than book 2 and there were so many other sub plots that I found myself not caring about.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is fine for a lonely person that is really board I don't have time to play for two hours straight
0670023329|5.0|I usually crack some sarcastic jokes in my reviews but honestly, there's nothing about which to joke when it comes to this book. This is a heartbreaking account of exactly what the title describes. It was frightening, sad and wonderful all at the same time. I could not put it down. Really. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />*I would not read it before bed. I could not stop reading it a few weeks ago and as a result, had terrible nightmares. Waking up in my comfortable, warm bed was a welcome return to reality.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love reading one second & checking Facebook or email the next on my tablet.  I love using the Kindle App.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|This is not an action movie.  Repeat: this is not an action movie.<br /><br />Rather, it's a character study that just happens to contain some visceral action sequences.<br /><br />I want to make that clear right up-front, because I get the feeling that too many of the folks giving this movie one-star reviews walked into the theater with much the same kind of wrong expectations that did the individual who sued this movie's producers upon realizing the flick wasn't a \\"Fast and the Furious\\" clone.<br /><br />So guess what?  This movie *isn't* a \\"Fast and Furious\\" clone - and thank goodness for that.  Yes, \\"Drive\\" has action, and when it comes it can be viscerally graphic (again, unlike the \\"Furious\\" films, where thousands of cars and bodies are crushed but nary a drop of blood is often spilled).<br /><br />And yet much of the film unfolds in quiet, concentrated bursts of silent lyricism that highlight the interplay between characters.  It's that intense quiet, rather than the intense violence, that defines the film's central character.<br /><br />In sum: Director Nicolas Winding Refn combines polished camera work, rock solid editing, and a solid score with stellar performances by the principles (a note: you may never look at Albert Brooks in quite the same way again) to create one of my favorite films of 2011.<br /><br />(And hey, nothing too much against the \\"Furious\\" flicks - I kinda enjoyed that last one; it was genuinely fun, in its own vacuous way.)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|run out of energy too quick but other than that it is a decent game. graphics are crisp. and so far very interesting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First off let me say that I am a HUGE fan of dystopian fiction and this book did not dissapoint!  I know when I've read a book that is truly something special when I cannot start any other book because I'm still haunted and touched by what I've just read. The first couple of chapters start out a bit slow but once things start picking up it's like a rollercoaster ride that you are equally eager to reach the conclusion and sad because you know it has to end.  This book has so many great things in it.  It is about survival but it also includes plot themes of unrequited love, hope and reaching for something better even though the rest of society tells you otherwise.  Everytime I would describe this book to a friend or family remember it would make me realize even more how great a story it is and made me want to hurry to bed at night to catch up with the friends and villains I'd grown to love and hate.  Not since The Passage has a book grabbed my attention utterly and completely and I was delighted to find that there is a 6th installment so I didn't have to mourn the loss of my new friends.  LOL Thank you Hugh Howey for giving readers a truly great piece of fiction and I will be a loyal reader as long as you keep writing.

B0053B347M|4.0|Colors are a little high for a TV Bias light.  Installed 6 behind a Samsung 55' 8000 LED LCD and used some USB splitters to get power to all strips.  Lights shut off and turn on with the TV, perfect.  No major complaints and being low powered is always a nice plus.  Also used behind computer monitors, works pretty well.  Lights could be a little brighter, maybe 8 LEDs in the same span as apposed to 6.
B005NKGEP2|1.0|This is terrible.  Very difficult to follow.  The plot is very sketchy.  Skips around in time a lot.  I would not recommend this book.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|Very let down that the danger zone levels weren't included.  I know amazon is developing their system for in-app purchases but for the price I still feel slighted that the iOS users always get more (the mighty eagle and \\"space eagle\\" being an example).  I have an iphone 4S and an iPad but prefer to play AB, in all of its forms,  on my kindle fire.  Here's to hoping that this changes soon.<br />-------<br />Update - Seems as if we Kindle users are still getting our updates last, even after PC.  The new Utopia update has been out since July 27th, and yet here we are with the most costly version of the app, still waiting.  Let down again.

1118156315|5.0|Truly a unique approach to getting a perspective of your career. The concepts of science and math are built on modeling. Balance sheets and income statements give a snapshot financial model of the company. Models describe the entity or the organization and how it functions. This is what \\"Business Model Generation\\" brought.<br /><br />\\"Business Model You\\" gives a very simplistic but visually powerful tool to be able to ascertain how one can take their career to the next level. As a coaching method, in working with clients, you would need to evaluate the organization that the individual is working for through \\"Business Model Generation\\" and then build their personal model through \\"Business Model You\\". It is important that the individual has to be aligned with the goals of the organization for that person to succeed. It then gives insight on how one can improve within that organization.<br /><br />Great book with wonderful illustrations, easy to follow, and a must-read for anyone that wants to improve their career.<br /><br />Jim Wylie, Business Coach (The Epiphany Experience)<br />One of the many contributing authors to this fine book!

B003GCXU9M|4.0|Aspiring writer and professional drunkard Henry Chinaski (Read: Charles Bukowski) decides he has \\"too many friends in Los Angeles ... hindering my career,\\" so he goes on the road like an inebriated, heterosexual Jack Kerouac in search of someplace he can \\"concentrate unmolested.\\" Every city is the same, or rather Henry doesn't change: He finds the quickest route to skid row, finds a cheap room and a menial, miserable job for enough money to maintain his buzz, then sits at his window at night, drinking and writing and occasionally contemplating suicide before moving on to the next flop. He tries sleeping in the park in El Paso, but the sailors wrestling the alligators keep him up. Longtime El Pasoans will recognize that's not just a case of the DT's. In a bar (natch), he hooks up with Laura, who has a sugar daddy, a one-armed millionaire who takes care of her and two other women. Chinaski moves in with this impromptu family, a kept man among kept women. It's the standard Bukowski novel: You can expect lots of drinking, brawling, vomiting, gambling, skidmarks, hilariously repulsive sex acts, dead end employment, cockroaches, crabs, DIY literature, etc. etc. \\"Hell boils with laughter.\\" Ladies, you might wanna skip this one, you don't come off well.

0670023329|5.0|I had the opportunity to hear Blaine Harden speak in Seattle yesterday about this book and his experience with Shin. If anyone is wondering, Shin is now living in South Korea. He has been promoting the book alongside Harden in recent weeks and Harden said Shin is \\"astonishingly good\\" at telling his story. (He said he \\"puts me to shame.\\") Harden and Shin are sharing the proceeds from the book 50-50, and it seems that will be Shin's major source of income moving forward. Shin still has recurring nightmares about his mother and continues to struggle while adjusting to this new world.<br /><br />Harden shared that North Korea has been running a totalitarian society for 64 years and counting. Compare that to 12 years of Nazi Germany. North Korea relies heavily on China for supplies. Without China's support, Harden said, North Korea would \\"stop moving\\" in a few months, if not weeks.<br /><br />I bought this book a couple weeks ago after reading an excerpt in The Guardian. I immediately was compelled by Shin's story to learn more. The book is an \\"easy read\\" in the sense that it's well-written, engaging and not very long (I read it in one sitting). However, it is difficult to comprehend the atrocities Shin experienced and that others continue to live through in North Korea. It is more difficult to get those images out of my head. It is truly unfathomable that this is happening in 2012. I commend Blaine Harden for taking the time to share Shin's story, and I am happy to know that half of the money I paid for this book is going to Shin.

B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This was one of the most frightening books I have ever read; scarier than the scariest Stephen King novel ( and I have read practically everything he has ever written). I could not put it down.  It was ironic that I picked it up soon after the Chardon high school shootings, but the book is not so much about a school shooting as it is about the mother's life after the event.  It is told entirely from her perspective, in a series of letters to her husband, whose whereabouts are only hinted at until the end. Very suspenseful, disturbing,yet compelling.

Generally, I buy an album if I give it at least 4 stars.<br /><br />1. 0<br />2. 0<br />3. 0<br />4. 0<br />5. 0<br />6. 0<br />7. 0<br />8. 1/2<br />9. 0<br />10. 1/2<br />11. 1/2<br />12. 0<br />13. 1/2<br />14. 1/2<br />15. 1<br />16. 1/2<br />17. 1/2<br />18. 1<br />19. 0<br />20. 1/2<br />21. 1/2<br />22. 1/2<br /><br />Summary: 7 stars - After hearing the first 14 tracks, I was typing away with a negative review... There were some good clubbin' type songs up to that point, but that isn't really my flava of music and much of it sounds too much like LMFAO to me (not bad, just not very original)... Then track 15, \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" came on... and basically saved the album for me. As you can tell by the scores, the second half of the album is MUCH better than the first. Track 18 \\"Gun Shot\\" is another bright spot. You might as well get the Deluxe version as tracks 20 thru 22 are all good. Nicki is the hottest sounding female hip-hop artist since Missy was in her prime. This chics got some talent!
B0061S0A64|3.0|I spent about 20 minutes with this app and just did not get the point.  It reminded me of the family piano that would sit in the living room abandoned, eager to have it's keys poked.  No matter what sound you made, it always was just background noise.  Maybe a beat, maybe a melodic tone of something but just noise that would drift away as a meaningless group of notes that had no beginning and end.  Well 20 minutes later, it was uninstalled.  Maybe I just didn't get it?

Instead of shutting down the Kindle just go to the menu button. When you click it you bottom menu bar pops up. Easy fix. Wish they would let you add friends like the Pet Shop Story. Anyway have fun!

B005MRXS78|1.0|Assembly was easy, and it comes with a complete set of international plugs.  And it supports my 10 ounce camcorder.<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />1) It has a nonstandard shoe - that doesn't even match the Polaroid tripod.<br />2) Once you've messed with the shoe and mounted everything, the assembly is internally wobbly.<br />3) The panning gear is noisy, so you can't use the internal mic on your camera.<br />4) Panning sometimes starts with a jerk.<br />5) Panning stops at least 4 times in panning the full distance, so you can't do a full pan smoothly.<br />6) Tilt moves very rapidly.<br />7) The remote has very limited range, and it must be in front of the bezel and pointed directly at it from a very short distance.<br /><br />Offhand, I can't think of a situation in which this would be terribly useful.

B000001GXC|4.0|Like others that have rated these recordings here, I find the performances of all three works very involving and enjoyable.  Admittedly, I'm not an expert in judging musicianship, but the Berlin under Von Karajan's directions sounds very good to me.  I would have given it 5 stars, but also like a couple of others have commented, I find the recording a bit too \\"bright\\" in spots (especially the 3rd).  And that is listening to it through  a system that will usually \\"sweeten\\" most recordings out.  That said, I also find other aspects of the recording excellent - the sound stage size and depth and instrument placement really give it presence and help to pull you into the performances.  Recommended.

B00338QENI|5.0|This was such a great story and I couldnt put it down. I never knew where hela came from. I had heard of it but now I know. Parts of the book were very technical and got slightly boring but the story of her and how her family never knew that her cells were the reason we have cures and other things was so interesting. What a shame they couldnt have helped her to survive. This is a must read.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is very simple to exit. All you do is press stuff, and then options. Doing this will bring up the bottom bar and allow you to exit. I think you should have experimented with the settings a little more before you freaked out and restarted your kindle then made a bad review. This leads me to believe that you guys who can't exit are quite simple minded..... Just try thinking next time. Great game!!!!

0345803485|4.0|i put this book down several times because it was all about the sex.  then, she started talking about the characters.  the book was hard to put down toward the end.<br />this is not just a sex book, it is about a man that is \\"broken\\".  u really start to feel for the characters.<br />yes, she does say a lot about his \\"looks\\".  i think it is cause she is insecure about herself.<br />this was worth the read.

B0073XORCY|4.0|Kind of a hard album to review, Ian Anderson is in fine form on this one both musically and vocally. The whole album sounds great sonically but it is almost to pristine for it's own good, it sounds great on headphones but for cranking in the car, no. The album is quite varied with all kinds of instruments, long and short songs, nicely sung in places, vocally spoken in others, the concept is in place but there are almost too many little snippet songs for my liking. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars, it is better than I thought it would be but it certainly doesn't measure up to some of Tull's more classic material. I would certainly recommend this to all Tull and Ian Anderson fans, for others, this album may not do a whole lot but it is certainly worth a spin or two even for those folks.
B00402FGE4|5.0|This can best be described as Stargate for adults.  The characters have been purged of their squeaky-clean carddboard patina; the plots have forsaken good guys versus bad guys cliches; even the stargates themselves seem a little dark and dingy.  These are not explorers, these are human beings trapped on an alien starship whose purpose and destination has so far eluded even the scientists among them.  At the beginning of each show, at least later in the season, the two main characters - who are also the two main antagonists - ominously say to each other \\"For the sake of the crew,\\" though each suspects the other doesn't really mean it, or means it in a way other than how he thinks it should be meant.  Imagine that: two completely contrary perspectives right from the get-go - and on a spaceship no less!  And even though these perspectives are loosely referred to as \\"military\\" and \\"civilian,\\" the boundary is anything but nice and neat and clearly marked.<br /><br />Even the perils the characters encounter are vague and, therefore, not easily overcome - and rarely overcome with a high-powered weapon or scientific know-how.  They're overcome - if they are at all - the old-fashioned way: by the characters trying to extricate themselves from the situation.  Sometimes, yes, weapons work; sometimes science works; but by-and-large it's trial and error that saves the day - kind of the way it works in the real world.<br /><br />It goes without saying the characters have \\"feet of clay\\" - an idiom very much absent from \\"Stargate Universe\\"'s predecessors in the Stargate franchise.  In fact, it sometimes seems they have hands and eyes and ears and noses and mouths and even brains of clay as well.  The writing is excellent: it's realistic, not stilted or stylistic.  The plots unfold gradually, which may sometimes make it appear there are no plots; but there are, they just take their time being resolved because there's rarely a \\"Deus ex Machina\\" (God in a Machine) to swoop down and save the day for everybody.  Colonel Lynch is no Colonel O'Neil, nor is Dr. Rush a Dr. McKay; they don't always find some key at the last minute to unlock the mystery about to consume the cast and make it all right again.  It's as likely to be one of the minor characters who finds a way out of the dilemma as one of the principals.<br /><br />I'm a very big fan of both \\"Stargate SG-1\\" and \\"Stargate Atlantis\\"; but that doesn't mean the grand heroics of these two shows appeals to me as much as they would, say, to a twelve year old.  And, of course, one of the biggest criticisms of \\"Stargate Universe\\" seems to be that it's not a \\"family\\" show - to which I stand up and cheer \\"Yes!  A science fiction show for adults - it's about time!.\\"  After watching a full season of \\"Stargate Universe,\\" I now cringe whenever SyFy pulls Anderson, Tapping or Shanks out of mothballs to try and infuse some fan-base appeal into the show.  I don't think it worked since \\"Stargate Universe\\" barely made it through its second season.  Which any one of us who gave it five stars could have told them.  A new show, even a spin-off, has to develop its own fan base to succeed - especially one that deviates from its predecessors' formulae.  And once you populate a show with actors like Robert Carlyle, Louis Ferreira and Ming-Na, and give them real characters, you can never try to re-populate it with a Richard Dean Anderson, Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks struggling to make cardboard characters glisten.

0345803485|1.0|The writing is utterly amateurish, the characters are cliched and uninteresting and the story not believable at all. I'm completely perplexed as to how this ended up on the best sellers list or who thought this book was worthy of anything beyond 1 star.<br /><br />I tried several times to read this book and each time, I had to mentally roll my eyes at how badly this was written. I recall reading somewhere that this was supposed to be \\"fan fiction\\" and it's very apparent that it is.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book for readers who truly want quality literature.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|better than watching watching them at the movies. The picture quality is amazing.  Can watch these over and over again
B0071T5PN0|4.0|Overall: worth the purchase.<br /><br />When the songs are on, they're firing on all cylinders, good hard rock and bluesy numbers.  However, several weak spots had me raising my eyebrows saying \\"what the heck?\\"  In particular, David Lee Roth pushes the vocals beyond his capabilities at times - not realizing he's not that young anymore.  His low baritone harmonies do, however, make up for the ill-advised showboating.
0345535421|3.0|Let me start by saying this is a book I enjoyed. With Clash of Kings, George R.R. Martin has developed his fantasy world to epic proportions, but perhaps he has made it a little too epic in the process. The book, like its predecessor, is written from the perspective of multiple Point-of-View (POV) characters. While no character is noticeably flat, its inevitable that a reader will attach themselves more to one character than the others. For me, this made it easy to put the book down at points because I would be faced with a \\"Sansa\\" or \\"Catelyn\\" chapter. I would have preferred a \\"Robb Stark\\" chapter in there somewhere, but a reader only learn of his actions through reports given to others, primarily his mother. Towards the end of the book, more things are happening and the chapters become shorter, most of the elements introduced are revisited and you are thankfully left at a satisfying breaking point. I do plan on picking up the 3rd book, however, I would be happier if there were an abridged version. The next book is even longer.
0440242401|2.0|Let me preface this with saying that I normally love her books & that's why I bought this one, but while there were funny parts, most of the characters were unsympathetic. Actually the person I felt the most for was the husband, Eric. Yes, Kinsella wrote him as one dimensional and robotic, but I kept just wanting Lexi to be honest with him and I bet that would have helped their relationship. He really did seem to care about her and when we were allowed to see past his robotic veneer, I saw a nice guy. The question is raised of if he would want her if she didn't have her teeth fixed, etc. But would have Jon wanted the snaggle-tooth, doormat Lexi? I doubt it. He probably wouldn't have looked her way twice.<br /><br />Also, we're supposed to think it's okay for Lexi to cheat on her husband (and for EIGHT months at that). When she realized she wanted to be with someone else, she should have left--why didn't she? Also, the thread holding her lover and her together at the end was really, really weak. So she remembered a song and had a dim memory of him and we're supposed to think that's enough for her to realize she is in love? Uh, yeah. Jon was a d-bag and I couldn't make myself like him. From the beginning he put her in a bad situation and then after realizing she truly forgot everything, he never bothered to fill her in on the deal that was supposed to save her department? He was too self-absorbed in his own woe-is-me love life. That doesn't ring true for someone who really loved her.<br /><br />The mother needed to be slapped into reality and the younger sister needed a big smack-down and tough love. The heroine had no backbone despite supposedly being tough and driven who rises to the occasion which apparently was always under there even when she was a 'doormat.'<br /><br />I do like SK's writing style, but the characters and how the story ultimately ended left me cold. I would have actually have liked to have seen her and Eric finally meet heart to heart and reconcile. Additionally, we're supposed to think that the 'beautiful' and well-off people are automatically shallow and bad, and the less glam are automatically better. That's a bit too cliched for me. The unnecessary F-bombs were also a turn-off.
B007SSDS24|1.0|This movie was a complete waste of time.  The plot was flimsy and so was the acting.  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, but the ending was horrible.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book, and to say it was disappointing is not harsh enough.  I pushed my way through it thinking maybe it would get better, but it was like watching porn...you've seen one, you've seen them all; nothing new, nothing exciting, just monotony.  I found it very hard to believe that this woman had never even touched herself but falls into lust with a man she had just met.  The story lacked background on any of the characters that made you want to feel something for them at all.  They were very one-dimensional.  Many of the \\"descriptive\\" scenes weren't at all, but they read like a 14 year old playing with trying to write something erotic to make his or her friends think she was cool. I still don't understand what all the hoopla is about this series.  I am definitely not interested in the rest of the \\"trilogy.\\"

B002BU0DPE|4.0|I've had my Turtle Beach PX21 gaming headset for about a year and a half. I bought them when I got my PS3 right before Black Ops was released. They are a great headset, made with only 1 minor flaw. My (Right) earphone snapped off at the swivel after about 3 months. I was able to McGyver the heck out of them, and took my time with a great duct taping job if I do say so myself. Granted it wasn't nearly as comfortable because the tilt/angle was off with my ear, but whatever, it was working. But I have used this headset for over a year even with the taped ear piece. And finally last night, the (Left) earpiece went silent. I have no sound, I know that I have a break in the wiring somewhere because I was able to mess with the connection next to the volume adjuster, and get sound, but it wouldn't stay. And trust me, I take care of all my electronic equipment/wiring.<br /><br />So despite all of this, I believe after a year and a half or so, that this is one of the best head sets you could buy given the price. Overall the quality of sound is fantastic, the make is great even with the minor flaw, and the headset itself is very comfortable. So I would say despite the one problem with the ear piece, I am going to be purchasing these again in the next day or two.<br /><br />Edit: Got my new pair yesterday afternoon. I'm a little disappointed, seeing as the \\"Chat\\" volume wheel does absolutely nothing. I should probably send it back, but honestly, I don't really care all that much. I can hear the chat, and that is all that matters, its not like I need the chat overriding the gameplay sound anyway. Overall, happy I bought these. They seem, I guess, a little \\"upgraded\\" from the first pair I had bought, so that's a bonus. They seem lighter and they now have screws in them which I'm assuming means you can replace parts if they break? Oh well, still like this set, I cannot justify spending over $100 for a pair of headphones I know will end up breaking in a year.<br /><br />Edit 2: TheChat volume wheel does work! I came up on the PS3 as the Turtle Beach PX21 Headset this time compared to USB Headset with my first pair. So I had to switch my chat settings on my PS3, and viola! It worked.
0345803485|2.0|Set mostly in Seattle, this tiresome book could possibly be construed as a story of the sexual self-discovery of a good-looking, smart, though virginal, twenty-two-year old girl graduating from college. The fact is that the characters, plot, dialogue, settings, etc are for the most part so simplistic, with many doses of explicit sexual scenarios that with the author's uninspired descriptions are nothing short of tedious and boring, that the book does not come close to being edifying or even exciting.<br /><br />The central character Anastasia Steele is perhaps somewhat sympathetic, but her seducer Christian Grey is totally contrived. In his upper twenties, but uber rich, the reader never is given a clue as to how he ascended to his lofty status. Of course, his looks are Greek-god like, but hide a predilection for sexually dominating and abusing females. Despite such claims, the author offers no credible evidence that he was wounded in the past.<br /><br />The interactions of Ana and Christian are simply not believable. No person is a cool and persuasive as Christian is portrayed; and no girl of Ana's accomplishments, although totally naïve in the world of relationships, would subject herself to such psychological tyranny. This book is apparently the first part of a trilogy, but there is really no place for this story to go. It is pretty much DOA.
B0079XNWQA|1.0|I am and will continue to be life-long fan of Jason Mraz. I've never been let down by his live recordings, but his studio stuff has progressively gotten weaker over the course of his career. This new album is no exception, and easily marks his dullest offering yet. Melodically there's almost nothing there to hold onto, but even worse are the thoughtless, lazy lyrics.<br /><br />This was a real surprise, but not in the way I wanted.

A great tribute to a great driver and an excellent introduction to F1 racing for those new to the sport.

I was drawn to him as I'd never been to anything or anyone in my life. I craved his touch like a drug, even knowing it would weaken me. I was flawed and damaged, and he opened those cracks in me so easily...<br /><br />Gideon knew. He had demons of his own. And we would become the mirrors that reflected each other's most private wounds... and desires.<br /><br />The bonds of his love transformed me, even as I prayed that the torment of our pasts didn't tear us apart...<br /><br />Lissa Reviews :<br /><br />First off I have to ask...., Where has Sylva Day been hiding all my reading days? I had downloaded this book by mistake and it is by far the best tender emotional erotic mistake I ever made. \\"Bared to You\\" bore into me from the first chapter and after finishing I still wanted more so I was elated to learn it was the first installment of many in the Crossfire Series.<br /><br />Day's writing style is one that I am sure many authors dream of achieving. As the words lyrically flowed across the page written in vivid details that not only brought the scenes to life in living color in my mind's eye but I could feel the life she breathed into the story radiating off the pages. Day shows that relationships are hard and they take work and compromise from each person involved to be successful.<br /><br />It wasn't until after I read the very last word till I glimpsed the cover. Thoughts cascaded my mind of what a cover of a book of this magnitude would hold. I was a bit disappointed. Yes the female comes across as sexually guarded and the male come across as needing her, which poetically reflects the story beneath the pages. I was just off put that the rings of intended belonging were not present on the cover. It would have added delicious bonus to bring everything together.<br /><br />Day begins weaving her magic by introducing us to Eva and Eva to Gideon... That is when she visits to her office building for the first time and she literally runs into Gideon and both their lives as they know it are changed. We gage the story from Eva's point of view, however it's obvious that they are instantly drawn to each other in an extreme attraction that is so instantaneous that neither can deny no matter how much they try. As it become apparent that the two are equally attracted to on another yet neither is looking for a relationship things take an emotional turn.<br />Both being survivors of childhood sexual assault, Eva and Gideon learn to let their guards down and lean on each other and battle he ghosts of their past. Only to find that things aren't always as simple as you wish for them to be.<br /><br />In this magnificently woven story of love as you read; your heart will open and your mind will soar right along with Eva and Gideon. You will cry, laugh and sigh while eager to turn the page. And when the story ends it will leave you wanting more of Eva and Gideon's story of two souls trying to turn what was once an act of violence was into unconditional love.<br /><br />My recommendation is that if you are over 18 and still have not read Sylvia Days \\"Bared to You\\", you must put this down and rush over to Amason.com and pick up your copy today. You will not be disappointed!<br /><br />Disclosure: I participate in reviews with Netgalley and an e-copy was provided to me by Netgalley and/or the publishers.

B0016492BW|5.0|Since my family immigrated from France to Scotland in the ninth century, about 700 years before we were kicked out of Scotland, I was highly offended by the portayal of the French in this movie.<br /><br />Other than that, it was quite the surprise when Sean Connery was revealed to be Indiana Jones's father.<br /><br />I was also intrigued and would have appreciated a featurette on how they made the duck weigh as much as the witch.<br /><br />The quality of the picture and sound were filthy, precisely replicating the quality of the script and the upbringing of the cast and crew.

0446572993|4.0|As The Innocent opens, Will Robie is carrying out a mission for his Agency masters.  He assassinates a man (and his four ultra-evil bodyguards) who is planning a military coup in Mexico that will create a government hostile to American interests.  This is followed by the rather improbable assassination of a Saudi prince.  Robie doesn't let himself be bothered by his assignments, but he finds himself with a dilemma when he's ordered to kill a nearly middle-aged woman in D.C., particularly when he discovers (after breaking into her apartment) that she's the mother of two, including the infant sleeping next to her, and a U.S. government employee to boot.  The dilemma is resolved when Robie's handler shoots mother and child from a distance and attempts to take out Robie in the process.<br /><br />After this dramatic opening, the story takes a strange twist when Robie, who wonders whether he has become the target of the government he once served, encounters fourteen-year-old girl named Julie whose parents have been murdered.  Robie and Julie barely survive the explosion of a bus on which they had been riding.  Who was the target:  Robie or Julie?  What, if any, is the connection between the woman Robie was sent to kill and Julie's parents?  Many gun battles and explosions later, the answer to those questions remains unclear.  That's what held my attention to the end of this fast-moving novel.<br /><br />I wouldn't call the plot byzantine, but it is deliciously complex.  To my amazement, every plot thread (even an incident or two I didn't expect to be important to the overall plot) comes together in the final chapters. The story covers a lot of ground and introduces a gaggle of supporting characters, ranging from Gulf One army buddies to traitorous FBI agents, from the retired assassin who is Robie's mentor to the White House political analyst who becomes his romantic interest.  Robie can't trust anyone, including the FBI agent with whom he is partnered (another potential romantic interest for the studly Robie).  None of the characters are given great depth but they seem real, and that's enough in a story that is driven by plot rather than character.<br /><br />David Baldacci's prose style is punchy and efficient.  Short sentences and single-sentence paragraphs during action sequences contribute to The Innocent's blistering pace.  There are times, particularly in the final chapters, when Baldacci succumbs to melodrama.  Since the story continues to be engaging, that is a forgivable sin.<br /><br />This is a dual climax thriller.  The novel seems to be moving toward a particular scene, but when that scene occurs, there are still many pages left.  That scene borders on the preposterous and the unmasking of a key bad guy -- clearly intended as a shocker -- is disappointingly obvious.  The second and final climax is unsurprising but satisfying.<br /><br />With all the action, suspense, and mystery that Baldacci provides, The Innocent will probably appeal to a Hollywood producer, particularly since brash, snarly fourteen-year-old girls always make appealing movie characters.  Thriller fans don't need to wait for Hollywood; The Innocent ran like a movie in my imagination as I was reading it.  I would give The Innocent 4 1/2 stars if I could.romantic interest for the studly Robie).

B004K4IZ3G|4.0|I saw the original Tron back in 1985 on a VHS player. Iwas hooked the minute they got into the video game world I was hooked. Loved the story about going into the game and defeating the MCP and Zark. When I got to my 20th viewing of the movie I realized this movie was about corporate deception, creating a technology that was about to go wrong, and about a savior to free a world form its oppressors.  That movie was indeed a classic and made me want to learn about computers and play video games.<br /><br />Fast forward 27 years later and my thrill of a new Tron was there . I was excited  but I wondered what would they hit on? what would it be about? could it at least be half as good as the first one? I saw legacy at the theater and also brought the DVD. Now let me say this . the movie can be enjoyed in both formats equally.<br />though if you have 3-D edition and got the tv as well you might enjoy the movie a little more.<br /><br />Back to the review Legacy hit on a number of issues that the writers did a wonderful job on. First its about a fractured father-son relationship being repaired after years apart, second its a bout a company losing its soul and needing a leader to bring it back, third, its about a man having to understand he has to tak responsibility for his life and grow up. Fourth its about a man playing God and his creation turning on him. Fianlly its once again about a Messiah comming and bringing down a evil dictator in the system.<br /><br />Legacy did leave a lot of questions to be answered in the movie. I'll admit its not a perfect movie plotwise. But if you saw the first one , then this movie will give a lot of fan service to you.<br /><br />The movie also was a good entry point to the world of Tron to new fans as well. I recomend the blu-ray version of the \\"Next Day\\" short. Fans of the original will definaly love the 35 second text message scene :).<br /><br />The movie isnt bad on DVD either now, but a clue(no pun intended) to part 3's possible enemy will be revealed in that short.<br /><br />This was a excellent movie but I would advise watching the first movie at least twice before watching this one
0913866156|4.0|awesome deck, very unique, very beautiful. got into a shouting match over this deck concerning the age-old question: but does it mean anything? pretty hard to win a ten minute argument over something that could conceivably take a lifetime to understand.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I was kind of against my husband spending even more money on our already very expensive camera, but this flash really makes a big difference in how pictures turn out.  If you're going to spend the money on an expensive camera, you might as well spend the money on this too.<br /><br />Update: This flash broke after a few months, it just stopped working.  We've returned it to Nikon and are waiting to see how they respond.  Will update when we find out.  I was disappointed that it broke so fast and we are both very careful with the camera and the flash.<br /><br />Update 2: Nikon sent us an email saying they received the flash and that it is covered 100% by warranty.  $0 cost to us.  We haven't received the new flash yet.<br /><br />Update 3:  We received the new flash and have been using it for about a year and there have been no problems with it.  My friends of FB really notice that our indoor pictures look better than others b/c of this flash.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|I really can't fault this edition. If you're a fan, you owe it to yourself to pick this up - especially considering the price! $30 for such a stellar collection is well worth it in my opinion. Everything about this edition feels like quality. I'm ecstatic that this is also region-free!<br /><br />If you're a goonie - this is a must!
0143120581|4.0|Most commentary you've heard of the book is by people who've never read it.  As a new dad, I appreciate the self-deprecating parody it is!  Great airplane reading while flying cross-country to visit my wife and son during my weekends off from full-time work and a full-time Master's program.  As you can tell, I relate to the busy lives of the Chua family.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I loved this game.it is fun to play and also easy to earn money.u build ur own ice age town and complete tasks for money.u would get it.
B000002IMG|4.0|This album, along with Practice What You Preach, is the pinnacle of Testament's work.  From the dizzying tempo changes of the title track to the ultra-heavy cover of \\"Nobody's Fault,\\" this is one of the best thrash records ever.  Alex Scolnick doesn't have Mustaine's ego, and his skills speak louder.  It's too bad these guys never got as much credit as the others.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|it would be great if I could use the rope to go down the well but it wont let me this is so frustrating I want to continue playing but there's nothing I can do unless it lets me down there

B0054JZC6E|5.0|My review is my opinion because I play it every day and<br />I will not get my eyes off it. I have yo force them to go somewhere else.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I stayed up all night playing this game. this game is very addictive.  my kids love it also. good for all ages.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm confused?  I just purchased this app via my Kindle Fire, it showed that it downloaded, I hit OPEN and played the game fine!!  When I finished playing I exited and when I tried to play again I went to my bookshelf where all apps and games show but NO Angry Birds Rio...hmmm.  The ONLY way I can play it is to click on APPS then STORE, then search for ANGRY BIRDS RIO.  When I click on the game (as if I was going to purchase) I click on OPEN & the game opens so I can play it!  I am wondering if this behavior has happened to anyone else and not sure WHY it is NOT appearing on my bookshelf so I can just click on it to PLAY?  Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|First to the author:<br />Hugh, you mentioned on your site that you read all of the reviews.  I want to thank you for this series of books.  I feel like I saw the events first hand while reading the series.  You have an amazing talent that is second to none.  I saw myself drifting off to Silo 18 even when I wasn't reading.  Thank you.<br /><br />This is a great series even for the casual reader.  The chapters are short enough that you can comfortably pick up the book when you know you can't commit hours to reading.  The plot moves in location frequently making it easy to pick back up if you are busy for a day or two.  What I mean is that there is a feeling of conclusion in that the reader knows that the story has wrapped up the \\"scene\\" and is moving elsewhere.  My point is that I didn't need to re-read a few pages when I pick the book up again, though it was tough to put down.<br /><br />The series is a great blend of sic-fi with elements of drama, and several hints of action.  I am so glad that I stumbled across this author and I look forward to starting his other works.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this game.It is easy and lots of fun.  my mom started playing and now I am too. I just cant stop playing.The graphics are so cute and it is super easy to play.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very enjoyable puzzle app. It is just hard enough to be challenging without being too hard. Only used hints on a few levels. Has some amusing badges.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This game is better than any other Angry Birds game!!!  It works a lot differently.  Once you get to understand it, you will realize that this app is worth the $3!!!  There are awesome black hole levels, and some even are like older games.  At level 30 in the first 2 planets, there is a pig in a machine who flies around and has to be destroyed!!!  The birds' costumes are amazing, and if you love highly addictive, creative, and space Angry Bird filled games, then this is definitely the app for you!!!
B0059XTTW8|1.0|Yea, this movie is a waste of time and good rental credits. I am embarrassed to think I suggested to my g/f that we watch it. There was almost no action, many scenes of people just walking around, and a hard to follow plot. I would imagine that, if you were to appreciate this movie, you'd be in the zone with British movies. This movie falls in line with other British movies I've seen in the past - Just not entertaining to me.
B00785P2QC|5.0|love love this game! Lots of fun!! would highly recommend to those who has played any other G5 games. I have played the first virtual city and was excited to see that G 5 came out with this new game!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Great series, even though the film deviates some from the books.  The Blu-Ray set worked just fine.  Can't wait for the next season.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great but should lower the prices on stuff to expensive but otherwise great and awesome game thanx for making it
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I thought I was getting the Original Swivel Sweeper but I ended up with Swivel Sweeper 2 (it has red parts on it). I like the handling and clean-out of the original model much better. This still works but it's not as effective or as smooth. Still worth having, but not worth the raves I had for the original model.
B001DHXT1G|3.0|So i got my copy and i was excited to learn that it came with a digital copy but when i opened it, the slip with the code was missing but the DC disc was there. I emailed universal to try to get the problem resolved and they told me that the period had \\"expired\\" for digital copies. If they really wanted to they could have just sent me a new code but I guess that was too difficult for them. The movie overall isn't bad. Definitely way better than the 2003 Eric Bana version...
B0055S348W|1.0|waste of time and money. doesn't find my network printer and no option to enter an IP address. chrome printing doesn't work on Linux.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|Make the. price lower and I would get it other than the price it is a preety good game so lower the price.
B006LG74R4|4.0|I've always enjoyed UK humor. This movie is right in the ballpark with Airplane, Naked Gun, and Animal House. If you're into that, this is a great movie.
B004FOA84A|2.0|I really need help with this game. I'm stuck now for well over a week. I'm usually pretty good at these puzzles but not this one and I am so frustrated! I need to get through the back of the wine cellar. (a wine bottle) and I am stuck w/a shovel and a battery. would sure appreciate some help... thanks I would like to finish the game
0545265355|5.0|Good: Fantastic books, I'm breezing right through them but trying to savor them as well.<br /><br />Bad: Ordered while in stock with two-day shipping and didn't receive them until over twenty days later.  If you're going to get these books I hope you're either:<br /><br />A: Not very interested and thus don't mind ridiculous waits for the product to be delivered.<br />or<br />B: Planning on getting them from another seller, as Amazon is extremely unreliable and customer service is pretty much a waste of time.<br /><br />Overall, get the books for sure, it will be a fantastic purchase, but I suggest being patient or ordering from Barnes and Noble or something.
B00753MBHA|5.0|I don't write long reviews, or many, either, but had to for this cd. I grew up with B.T.T.W., Restless and Wild, Metal Heart and Russian Roulette. The first 3 mentioned are MUST haves for your collection. As good as these are, this new Accept, with Mark on lead, stands with these albums, and maybe a little higher than the rest. No weak songs, no filler, all of the power and lead breaks that Accept is known for, and then some. My recommendation for album/cd of the year, even though we still have till December to go. GO BUY THE ALBUM NOW!! Not on MP3, at least CD or Vinyl. Phenomenal Album!
B000X107GI|5.0|Arrived when needed and at a very good price. A few of my gadgets tend to \\"eat\\" batteries so having a source that is reliable and less exspensive is a plus.

0545265355|5.0|The books are on top of the charts just like the movie, even though the 1st book is better. The action keeps you on your toes as well as the romance that keeps you wondering who she will end up with in the end. Laughing, crying and cheering all the way through the end of the end of the third book, is amazing. This set of books just kept gettng better and better....All three are must read...
B0061S0A64|5.0|glad I downloaded this app. very fun and relaxing to play around with. works well on kindle fire. very entertaining.
0345803485|5.0|http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345803485/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title ... This is an amazing book, I could not put it down. It keeps you reading, breathless and wanting more. I am waiting with chills for Amazon to send me the next book and as soon as the end of the week I will be getting a ebook so I dont have to wait ever again.
B00127RAJY|4.0|My review is just short and sweet.  After using the DVD one time, I was hooked, and oh, so sore the next day!  I didn't have actual weights to begin with, but did purchase some and wow, what a difference it makes.  I'm actually excited to work out later today.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app is so cool and fun!!! It can be a little frustrating when you're stuck on a level and you have no hints, but it makes you think, and that's good.
B0058YPGSY|1.0|I once saw this was going to be released in December so I had this bookmarked and now i see it's STILL on pre-order?  What's up with that?  Is the DVD version available or not?
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a great DVD and a great story!!!...If you love great acting and history, you will enjoy this series!

B006JD48NM|5.0|I bought this DVD for my husband, who does amateur racing. He was so excited! Couldn't believe I had tracked the release date in the US. He said it was a great documentary of not only Senna but all the accidents that transpired that weekend... and racing in general.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is one big stinking pile of fun. I especially like catching the skrat before he can get across the screen.
0307454568|5.0|This is a great read! I read all three in the trilogy. I think Stieg Larsson was amazing. Can't believe he didn't get to know how well received his books would be. The only trouble with the book is that you cannot put it down.
B005DD7H50|4.0|Both my wife and I found this movie to be very enjoyable.  It held our attention, the plot was good, as were the action scenes.  I would recommend this movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|loved it! it was so awesome and I play it all the time its so cool and I hope everyone likes it
B002ZG974W|5.0|My children and I love this movie.  It is very enjoyable and educational.  It shows babies having fun while growing in four different environments and cultures.  It is a great family movie.  And it will make you laugh.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I would have given 5 stars if not for all my stuff  being set for 76 hours... and my energy not replenishing while game is off.
1612130283|2.0|I have to wonder what does Gloria Steinem, who went to the barricades for female empowerment and equality, think about Fifty Shades of Grey, a novel hyped as mommy porn. The sadomasochistic relationship in this trilogy describes a fantasy of female submission between a virginal college student and a neurotic, sadistic man with control issues who perhaps feels inadequate. I find the interest in the book perplexing and it raises questions about our society and its pervasive depersonalized male-female relationships.<br /><br />Erotica and porn have been around for centuries, so why so much buzz about this book? Is female subjugation-- being tied up, whipped, chained etc-- for a man's personal enjoyment a turn-on for women and men?  Are so many females lacking in a passionate, erotically charged sexual encounter that pain and debasement becomes Nirvana?  I thought men and women were supposed to feel something for each other approaching affection and caring when they made love--or is this an antiquated attitude? I understand the raw pull of desire and the urge to have what you must have. But is kinky the only way to get it on and have an orgasm? What ignites passion and desire anyhow?<br /><br />Lisbeth Sanders, the protagonist in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a survivor of abuse and a feminist avenger because of the degrading, humiliating rape she experienced at the hands of her guardian, a ruthless man who sodomized her.  Is there an undercurrent of similarity to the dominant/submissive relationship in FSG and that of the Guardian controlling Lisbeth?  Both men are damaged, deviant and dominant<br /><br />There is an abundance of fetishistic porn available 24/7 on line that is cheap, satisfying and readily available. Is all this fueling a strange and bizarre attitude about sex? Perhaps men and women have become so available to each other in a superficial sense that they're inaccessible on a deeper level. Is this a reflection of the new world of romantic fantasy and does it touch on a more complex societal issue? I wonder if there is a connection with the hugely profitable and violent world-wide business of under-age sex-slave trafficking.  Perhaps men are watching so much pornography that the women they have sex with are being subjected to more aggressive demands during sexual encounters. Is this one explanation for the hype about a book that is demeaning and degrading to women and glamorizes deviant sexuality?<br /><br />Some readers of Fifty Shades of Grey have commented that they shredded the book for its explicit violence and abhorrent, antiquated treatment of women. Others never finished it because it became boring and repetitive. They called it trashy with undeveloped pacing, filled with detail that doesn't go anywhere and lacking the content of a developed novel.  I think there is a large market of readers looking for a well-written erotically-charged novel, without the deviant sexual behaviors.<br /><br />About me: I'm the author of \\"Final Exit...A Suspenseful Tale of Passion Unleashed,\\" a novel that straddles the line between romantic suspense and literary fiction. The book has been praised for its sensuality, suspense and evocative prose, and how well the story brings to the page some of the most compelling and timeless questions concerning love and intimacy.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was suggested to me by a middle school librarian to help pass time. I read this book in two and a half days. The author wrote this book with a dual narration, which at first was confusing. But once I got a couple pages into the book I was able to follow easily. As for the age of the reader, I would say no younger then 8th grade unless you have a very mature child.<br />The two main characters Clay is the listener of the tapes, and Hannah is the suicidal teen that makes the tapes are amazing. Clay is a great role model while Hannah is an innocent girl that lives threw the typical teen ridicule of rumors, teasing, and lies that in combination to home issues send her into a downward spiral. And to explain why she has made such a selfish decision she records these seven audio tapes that get delivered to each person that caused her pain.<br />Take some time to read this book, if not alone read it with your child. I think this book is going to make a difference for someone out in the world. Hopefully before it is too late.
B001P5M7QE|1.0|The title says it all. I was very much looking forwad to watching the Holy Grail which I had not seen in many years. Unfortunately, the sound level was so low, that I could not even watch it.<br /><br />Obviously, I think anyone would agree, Amazon is quite capable of resolving this issue...
B003L77G10|5.0|Wonderful!  So much fun to watch sequentially and pick up on things missed prior.  Omitted scenes interesting to see as well.
B0061S0A64|5.0|Had no idea what this was and am so glad to have it purchased. I have nothing else like it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. it has a storyline and your not stuck with a limited amount of play each day like other games from this genre.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This book is a great read when you approach it as a YA read.  I do have a problem with so much killing for kids.  However, the story kept me engaged.
B0026772N8|5.0|I first read this book more than 10 years ago, and still can just pick it up at any page and find something in it to bring some peace and reflection to my mind.  That reason alone is enough to make it worth five stars to me, but my text copy is one of the books I've lent out most frequently over the years and each person has taken something good and different from it.  Even if that something is what they disagree with it has been a thought provoking read, and that is rarely a bad thing.
1594744769|2.0|The book was good and interesting and then you realize that when it really starts trying to take you somewhere there are only 20 or so pages left. The ending was very blah and kind of just forgot about all of the rules it had created up until that point. It was almost as if the author just decided to say screw everything and the rules I've been establishing. I was very disappointed with this story once I was finished. It was written and ended as if there's a sequel planned like a Hollywood movie. Essentially I liked the premise but the ending fell way flat and far off.
0307719219|4.0|A very informative and eye opening account of the reason the World and especially the US is in the situation they are today. It gave me a new perspective on the events that lead up to the delemas we are encountering now.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Game is pretty cool I like it. I play both cities the playground can use some more excitement and I'm stuck on one level in the other.
B007HJ84WS|4.0|Story was good and special effects were good as well. Good mix of mythology and history in my opinion. Could see follow up to this movie.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Was a great game until a few days ago when everything jumped to over 24 hours to do. I have been harvesting the same crops for about 5 days. I log in after not being on all day and still have no energy.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|after playing for a few weeks it started shutting down and locking my kindle up. also game items that you collect from started out with one &quot;time&quot; between collecting then gradually increased. crazy!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I really like playing this game. all the food looks so delicious! I wish there were more things to buy that didn't cost real money tho.
B000CNE092|5.0|Fantastic movie for all kids but especially for girls.  Truly one of the best animated films made.  For the first time that I can remember in a kid's movie, the girl is the HERO.  Anastasia saves her \\"love interest\\" (and all of Paris) all by herself.  Even my daughter said, \\"Girls save boys. right Mommy?\\"<br /><br />And the music is stunningly beautiful.  There should be more kid's films like this one.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good read. Very sexual in nature, so if your pruddish don't bother. Have heard it described as mommy porn, and can understand why. Not the most well written book ive ever read, although it does keep you hooked. Someone asked we whilst reading it for a quick description - mills & boon but xrated. Have read the whole trilogy and enjoyed.
0307477479|1.0|I read the award winning books every year but found wading through this one especially tedious. Populated by a large cast of mostly unlikeable (but loosely connected) characters, this book tacks and forth in time through vignettes from multiple points of view without a discernable plot. The approach didn't seem avant garde or groundbreaking to me--it was just confusing. Also the over-hyped \\"Power Point\\" chapter left me cold. Maybe seeing too many of these at work soured me on the creative brilliance of Power Points as a literary device. Although this book may appeal to your inner English major, it left me totally baffled that it won the coveted Pulitzer prize.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was a little disappointed with this book. It was \\"just ok\\", not a bad read if you don't have anything else.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Okay to get out of the app ( if ur having problems) you click the button that say STUFF then click options. Then ( if you need it) the bar will appear. You can change volume and etc.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I did like this book better than the first one, but not enough to continue to the third book. I felt that their wasn't enough depth to this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is an excellent game. very fun to play. Great to relax and get away from the real world. Great for kids.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I should be giving this app a one star rating for keeping me up way too late.  This app is very soothing to listen to.
B0061S0A64|5.0|Wow! I love it! It's easy to make music and relaxing to listen to. Just a bit of musical fun.  Enough options to make it interesting.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been so happy with everything about this app from the stability of the platform to the different versions to the readsing plans. I highly recommend it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great read for adults. Its gripping and entertainingly awesome. It leaves your subconscious wanting more. Thankfully. There is more!.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The third book was my least favorite of all 3. By this point the story has lost almost all fantasy and started to read like a normal fiction with a tiny bit of science thrown in. It gets kind of confusing with Katniss blacking out so often and being left in the dark on some of the plans. I feel like I know way too much about the unimportant cat (just filling pages?). The ending was a big disappointment IMO and by that time I only continued reading in order to find out what happens, not because I was very interested. I would still highly recommend the series to everyone I know. I am planning on buying them all and I will probably read them again in the future.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great time passer n super fun I play everyday. I would suggest the game to anyone. you have got to try it out!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is even better than the ipad version.  all my important notes are everywhere I go.  plans, schematics, ideas, etc...  evernote is an essential part of any digital tool I use.

0596806027|3.0|A how-to manual that explores the new offerings of HTML5.<br /><br />My Take<br />Interesting, but I didn't feel that it was getting me up and running!<br /><br />First, let me say that this is more for an intermediate experienced web designer who already is comfortable with coding in HTML and CSS although if the book was intended for more advanced users, I don't understand why he spent so much time on the history of HTML.<br /><br />I found the whole book uneven with some of his topics too briefly peeked at while others went into much greater depth. Pilgrim skimmed the new elements introduced with HTML5, and was as unclear as everyone else in the proper use of SECTION<br />and ARTICLE. Actually, in some respects, he was worse. There's a very brief mention of Modernizr which could have been left off for all the good it did.<br /><br />The good parts. Yes, in spite of my whining, there was a chunk of useful information that Pilgrim explained well. I finally grasp how HGROUP is supposed to be used and I loved his explanation of a codec. It finally makes sense! Yes!!<br /><br />I enjoyed his discussion of the new tags for forms and, while he did a reasonable job of explaining the tangle of video formats and codecs, it was still a confusing tangle that didn't get untangled until just about the last sentence. I'll stay with YouTube for my videos...eek!<br /><br />The section on microdata. Well, once I researched Google's Webmaster Tools Help section, Pilgrim's pages finally made more sense.<br /><br />He spends quite a bit of time explaining the use of CANVAS and a decent amount on videos, Local Storage, and the new offline capabilities (I am so looking forward to implementing this one!), but it's still too far in the future [for me!] to dive into a total dissection of it all.<br /><br />On the whole, it was interesting, but I'm not sure it's worth the $30.<br /><br />The Cover<br />It's your basic O'Reilly publication with a white background. HTML5 is in white with a teal green rectangle with some sort of deer perched on top of the rectangle. I suspect it would be a good guess that the deer is meant to embody the Up and Running portion of the title!<br /><br />As for the title, yes, it is HTML5, but I would beg to differ as to whether it would get me Up and Running. No, I take that back. It did have me running. Running to do more research...al green rectangle with some sort of deer perched on top of the rectangle.

B0055SWM08|4.0|This game is difficult enough to make you think but not so hard as to be frustrating. The soundtrack is great for when you are trying to wind down.<br /><br />That said, the \\"rate me\\" pop up was horrible and intrusive.
B0061S0A64|5.0|Interesting concept and design for an app. The developed did well with this app. This app is very addicting. Great job!
B006Q6MOCY|5.0|Excellent version of this classic album, clean and bright sounding. I only wish they had included the mono version. I recently bought the 180 gram mono LP and I still think that mono LP sounds the best. MFSL always does a really good job.
B007DIQB50|5.0|A lot of mixed feelings and reviews with this album and Nicki Minaj as an artist.  However, to sum this album up is like Nicki Minaj summed it up, \\"Freedom\\" and not locked into a box.  She went into the recording studio and just went for it-no formula, no script.  And that's the uniqueness and versatility of her as an artist, which is always a great thing.  You have to stand out and she does that with no problem.<br /><br />LOVE THE ALBUM! Not so fond of the d*** and p**** lyrics, because I know she can come off lyrically better than that 100%, but however, the dance/pop/R&B stuff is refreshing the most of the album.  And it points out the UNRECOGNIZED side of her (artistally and genre-wise) that's truly talented.  If she can just step away from the crappiness of Lil' Wayne and the Cash Money BS, she can soar.<br /><br />If you are not open minded, don't buy the album.  If you love versatility and \\"FREEDOM\\", you will get your money's worth.<br /><br />Get em' Nicki!

Anastasia and Christian continue their courtship in an unreal manner. Did anyone count how many condoms are used by Christian in this book alone? OMG!!!!!! E.L. James is a genius.
1118156315|5.0|I am a personal language learning coach for Japanese business people.<br />Most of them do not have clear understanding of who they really are.<br />This model could help them deeply think about that in English.
B000X9ZERW|5.0|Legendary album and one of the landmarks in music from the past 30 years, up there with Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" for influence.<br />The album is great all through and it really doesn't matter where they are originally from, they relate well to the younger generation from the poorer neighborhoods. Springsteen never held a regular job but he relates to the working class.  Artist don't necessary need to live the life to express it.
B00005214X|4.0|I first bought this album in 1990. I listened to little else that summer & still listen to it now, 20 plus years later. Aside from the meandering jams at the end of disc 2 (one of these \\"songs\\" would have been enough) there's not a single track that I dislike. I agree that the orignal CD's sound was far from stellar, but the sheer quality of the music made that point moot. The new discs sound awesome, but the way these discs have been sequenced is a travesty. The bonus trax (I live for You is fantastic & I can't figure out why that wasn't on the orignal album) should be at the end of disc 2, not placed in seemingly willy nilly fashion at the end of disc 1. After listening to this album thousands of times, I expect \\"beware of Darkness\\" to kick in right after \\"Apple Scruffs\\"--not \\"I Live For You\\". Another attempt on trying to reinvent the wheel. If I were allowed to give this 2 ratings, I would give a 5 for the music & remastered sound but only a three for the sequencing of the music.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|delightful distraction that adds new elements to the genre<br /><br /> love the fishing and hunting bits and the pioneer flavor. random happenings make it a little more interesting as well.
0312641893|5.0|Why?<br /><br />WHY DIDN'T I READ THIS BOOK SOONER?!<br /><br />It was so AWESOME!<br /><br />MY EMOTIONS!!<br /><br />Let me go ahead and get this out of the way. I loved this book. Why in the world did I procrastinate with reading it? I've had Cinder sitting on my Kindle for a few months now and I continued to put it off over and over again. What a HUGE mistake! I even had the nerve to go into my local bookstore twice, pick Cinder up, and put it right back down. But all that doesn't really matter now because I've remedied the problem and absolutely fallen in love with this wonderful story.<br /><br />When I first heard of Cinder before it's release, it was gaining quite a bit of buzz known for the retelling of Cinderella. Marissa Meyer, my hat's off to you because a cyborg Cinderella in New Beijing, China? Badass. But then shortly before I read it, another blogger informed me that not only is it a Cinderella retelling, but also had Sailor Moon elements. OMG... someone had answered my prayers!  I don't think you can understand my excitement for that.<br /><br />Sailor Moon was my all-time favorite TV show and manga as a child. Reading Cinder reminded me of a simpler time before responsibilities, when the biggest thing I had to worry about was setting up the VCR (yes, a throwback!) every day because at 4pm, right before Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon would come on. If I were to miss one episode, I would cry my little eyes out because I just had to know what happened next to Serena! I have seen every episode including the fifth season that didn't air in America. I've even seen the live action series in all Japanese. And for those that watch subtitled Japanese shows, you know that there comes a time in your marathon watching where you stop reading the subtitles and start thinking Japanese in your sleep. Yes, I am super fangirling and not ashamed one bit! So I think it goes without saying that the reasons for me loving Cinder so much, aside from being blasted by a rainbow of awesome with its creative premise, is that it has a lot to do with sentamental memories. I tell you this so you can understand one big thing:<br /><br />Moon Gusta, baby!<br /><br />I wasn't sure about Cinder at first. As soon as the book started I noticed on every obvious downfall: Predictability. Seriously, the plot twist ran up to me and sucker punched me in the face at only 10% in. This concerned me, but it quickly became a non-issue as I continued to read. Why? Because the story was interesting. It was engaging. It was just plain old fun! And I haven't had this much fun reading a book in a while.<br /><br />The plot was brilliantly done. Cinder is a mechanic, under appreciated by her mother and one of her step-sisters. The other step-sister adores her. As a cyborg she doesn't have the same rights as a normal person and her step-mother goes out of her way to remind Cinder this whenever she can. One day Prince Kai (*swoon*) requests her services to fix his android. And in true fairy tale fashion he begins to fall for her not knowing she is a cyborg. But this isn't just a love story. Oh no! The world has been suffering from a deadly disease that kills in a matter of days and it starts to become painfully obvious that Earth's only hope for a cure depends on an alliance with the evil Lunar Queen. And as you may have guessed it, she has plans for Earth. Dun, dun, duuuunnnnnn!<br /><br />I loved all the characters in Cinder, especially the heroine. Cinder was independent, feisty, and relatable. She didn't always make the right desicion, but this is a heroine that learns from her mistakes. And (Tuxedo Mask) Prince Kai? I loved him. Ah, the memories!<br /><br />The romance was so sweet. At first Cinder is wary of the Prince's advances because she is cyborg and doesn't want him to find out, but she can't help but develop feelings for him along the way. Basically what I'm saying here is that there's no insta-love. And you know how much I hate insta-love!<br /><br />Oh,and that ending! Marissa Meyer, how could you do that to my little heart? I need to know what happens now! You took two of my favorite stories and twisted them into this big ball of badass awesomeness and now I'm expected to wait until next year for book two?! And just look that the character line-up for the next books in the series: Scarlet, Cress and Winter. Little Red Riding Hood, Rapeunzel and Snow White?!  I am so there. Just so we are clear, I'm not above stalking.<br /><br />I will have the next book and I will have it soon...and that ending! Marissa Meyer, how could you do that to my little heart?

B000EXZI1O|5.0|This is the best album from Bee Gees even after hearing for more than 30 years...Songs like Reaching Out, I'm Satisfied, Stop (Think Again) are all very everlasting songs as Too Much Heaven, Tragedy and Love You Inside Out. It is worth to buy again although I have a local print copy...
B000683VI4|5.0|Great movie, lovely history, I like the drama in this movie, it is really nice how they meet and they stay together that long, Amazing film
B007PTJOV0|5.0|reminds me of games from my younger days!  fun for my daughter to play too.  keeps us entertained for a long time
B005IQZB14|5.0|Too many people (myself included) who learn something from a trek such as this want to write about their experience. I've read enough of this genre ('Trail Memoirs') to know that not everyone should.<br />This is the best I've read.<br />Read it.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|I listen to this album again and again. I cannot seem to get tired of it. I love the indie rock/punk sound combined with Nate Ruess' thoughtful, mature lyrical themes (see At Least I'm Not As Sad As I Used to Be, I Wanna Be the One, and The Gambler). Nate's appreciation for life really comes through in his lyrics. Now that I am in my thirties, I am ready for lyrics that speak to my current life stage, but with music I can nod my head to. This album has that in spades.
B00068TJM6|5.0|This watch is simply amazing, the luster, density, and quality of the watch are top notch. I would recommend this watch to anyone who wants a great looking watch with performance to match.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun Game! Really addictive! Got it as a freebie of the day and really like it. Some of the puzzles are easy but most are challenging.
B005FISC52|5.0|This ninth and final season, wraps up my One Tree Hill collection. It is a must have for any One Tree Hill fan, for the extras alone. The sit down with the cast, to do a Q&A after they were done filming the last episodes is great. Also, the commentary during the last episode, with Bethany Joy, Sophia Bush, Mark Schwahn, and Lee Norris is really good. I recommend this for any OTH fan.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I can't believe I'm spending so much time playing this app. It's ridiculously. fun.  Too cute for words. Keep the updates coming.

630463949X|5.0|I have watched this DVD back to back on endless occasions. Musically brilliant, emotional and incredible guitar from Lindsy Buckingham. Nothing matches this band, if only I could buy it in high definition. This DVD is brilliant and never equalled, I bought it in 1997 when it was first released and one of a handful of DVDs on sale at the Vigin Mega Store in New York. If you like great  music buy The Dance, it's crisp and beautifully arranged. Xxxx

B007P3TMW2|1.0|I thought the whole movie was boring and annoying. Other 9/11 movies like United 93 and Twin Towers are much more inspirational. Now you enjoy watching an aggravated depressed child for 90 minutes this is just the movie for you, not for me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I played for a while but but then got bored because the games r not challenging maybe because. I haven't. unlock the rest of the other ones... my nephew. which. is 5 played it he loved it and it kept him well intertain.. never. herd much of him after he started.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|The characters in this film are so believable and real. These are the same folks that produced About Schmidt and Sideways. The soundtrack is also pleasantly woven with native Hawaiian music.
B000AP04FG|4.0|This is enjoyable in every way. The story is clever and suspenseful and the characters are immensely likable--a perfect pair, with straight-face acting of hilarious situations. Don't miss this.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun love it just like the movie relieved that its not long to loaded. play it and also its free
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The first part of the trilogy is a supreme achievement that should not be missed for anything. This part sentimentalizes and glamorizes crime but it's such a good movie that i am willing to ignore that. (The second and third portions are preachy sops to the moralists--no, crime does not pay--and i would not rate them higher than two stars, or even one.)
B0063IH60K|5.0|keeps you entertained and works still if wi fi is not. easy to read and basic solitaire like I like.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|The Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware, Graphite is a fine enclosure for the Kindle Fire. The cover folds behind it, allowing the pad user to prop up their device while reading, and it has a cover strap that can be folded over for hand-held enjoyment. It also protects my device from smudges, scuffs, and fluids. Importantly, it adds the fractions of the inch necessary to prevent the power button from being pressed when I stand the device upright. Who on Earth would put the power button on the bottom? That's like installing your garage door opener on the sole of your shoe.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I have purchased this, and it was fun on my tablet. However, my tablet doesn't support multi-touch, so it makes it near impossible to play past i think level 5. And for some reason (i think its because i purchased it as a FAOTD, even though i had no funds, which isn't normally possible)it won't download onto my phone, which does support multi-touch. I have tried everything. Uninstalling the Appstore, clearing its data, even factory resetting my phone, and it won't download. The same thing happened with a few other apps, so its probably my device.<br />Still a fun app, only played first few levels, wish i could play more
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I picked this extender up so that I would be able to use my iPhone 4 in its OtterBox Defender case in my XM Skydock. It works very well. I have had no issues with it so far and really love the fact that I can have my phone in its case and still use my XM radio so I don't need to remove the case each time I want to use the phone in my Skydock.<br /><br />Awesome device.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|when I downloaded this app, it slowed down my whole kindle. it starts downloading some stupid file after the game is downloaded. if u enjoy slowing down $200 devices, then get this app. if u don't like that, then DONT GET THIS APP
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. The stories are beautifully written, evoking a dystopic world which draws you in immediately. I was so taken with the first story that I finished the entire collection in less than two days. Cannot wait to read more from this author!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I've heard the hype and downloaded the book.  Now, however, I'm struggling to get to at least page 200.  While I completely recognize that this is a work of fiction, I find it hard to believe the author has chosen to have Christian Grey at 27 and not older.  Ana, poor thing, is too stupid in the ways of the world, it's unbelievable.  For the author to have her a virgin is unrealistic in this day and age. Plus, the repetitiveness is wearing very thin with me.  Unless it gets better, I won't succumb and download the next two.<br /><br />Should the awful writing be blamed solely on the author or the editors combined?  Stephanie Meyer she is not but apparently, we've made her very rich just the same.
B0015XWUC2|5.0|i love every song on this album! i could listen to rick astley and his music all day and never tire of it. great british sound.<br />i travelled back to when this album's hit songs first came out in the 80s and it was perfection all over again. this is a great buy. fantastic sing-along music. enjoy!

B000000OF6|5.0|every hit song by Queen is on this two cd set album. i urge you to add this to your music collections.<br />the only sad part for me was that each time i listened to these songs, i thought of the phenomenal and unparalleled freddie mercury, queen's frontman who died in 1991. what many people don't know is that freddie mercury was British schooled and had solid art and music training. this reminds me a lot of david bowie who was also British art school trained. it is no surprise then that God brought the two of them together on one of my favorite songs- \\"under pressure.\\" i could listen to these songs a million times over and quite frankly they never get old. i am so glad that freddie mercury left a musical and theatrical iconic legacy through queen that no one will ever forget. thank god that we can still hold a piece of freddie in our hearts with every auscult. go ahead and seize the day- purchase this cd with no regrets. go freddie and go queen- we love you! enjoy!
B007PTJOV0|1.0|fun but challenging. like Mario brothers but st Patrick's day I haven't beat it yet but I will beat it
B005P3NPXG|5.0|i really love this album! it was like reliving the original, hit soul music releases all over again. seal sings each song with every piece of his soul and it shows. seal's depth and rich voice put these renditions on the same level as the originals. who said that things could not be better the second time around? seal proves that the second time is the greatest time:) now, if only we can get heidi klum to agree, the world would then be perfect again. much love to both seal, heidi and their children. a beautiful family at that. enjoy!

B0052GACNM|5.0|tony bennett performed a live concert on hsn (home shopping network) (ch. hsn) promoting this album (which hsn carried for sale at the time and may perhaps still have it offerred in its inventory--check it out) some time in early september 2011.  some of bennett's friends were in attendane and overall the concert was most enjoyable. also, pbs (ch. pbs) made a documentary on the making of this album. i saw that pbs documentary too and it is really great and well done. if the dvd is available for purchase at pbs. org's gift shop, then i highly recommend that you purchase it. not only will you be supporting pbs (which we all need to do), but you will also add a great dvd to your home collection that you will find yourself re-visiting time and time again. yes, it is that good. also, i must say right away that every singer on this album gives a fantastic, memorable performance.<br /><br />if i had to pick some favorite tracks, i suggest the following:<br /><br />track 4: \\"don't get around much anymore\\" bennett duet with michael buble (love buble's voice)<br />track 3: \\"body and soul\\" bennet duet with amy winehouse (her last recording before she died)<br />track 7: \\"the girl i love\\" bennett duet with sheryl crow (sheryl crow's voice sounds so different that i did not know it was her doing the singing)<br />**********track 10: \\"speak low\\" bennett duet with norah jones-- THIS IS MY FAVORITE (out of my favorites) TRACK***I LOVE,LOVE,LOVE IT!!!<br />track 11: \\"this is all i ask\\" bennett duet with josh groban (again, great voice)<br />track 13: \\"stranger in paradise\\" bennett duet with andrea bocelli (andrea the master gets down)<br />track 15: \\"yesterday i heard the rain\\" bennett duet with alejandro sanz (love the accentuation in sanz's voice)<br />track 12: \\"watch what happens\\" bennett duet with natalie cole (is natalie cole's voice ever non-soothing? the answer is no and this song is no exception)<br /><br />i hope that my review helps!!! i definitely believe that this albumis an indelible, historical achievement by some of the greatest performers of our time. download and purchase today.  enjoy!
0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire was a great read.  Very exciting throughout. So now the expected natural progression is to read the concluding book of the series.  Well not by me.  From reading the reviews, the 3rd book Mockingjay has completey changed the pace of the first two. While Catching Fire was an action/thriller page turner, Mockingjay I heard is more of a depressing PTSD monologue. I know that a novel cannot be judged by a readers expectations and I am not doing that here.  But I have to add that when I choose a genre, I can only hope that the work will continue in the general direction the established plot was built on.  I believe Mockingjay completely changed the pace that The Hunger Games and Catching Fire had begun. I did not pick up the Hunger Games series to enlighten myself to a reality check concerning the horrors of war and PTSD. I choose genres like these to escape reality and lose myself in fantasy.  Maybe I am too simple hoping for a good defeats evil in one of those fantastical finishes, but that is what I was hoping for and from what I gathered from the reviews I will not get anything resembling the pace of the first two books of the Hunger Games in Mockingjay.  So to finish, I really had a great time with The Hunger Games and Catching Fire.  Those two books were as exciting and fun to read as any I have read in a long time.  As for the concluding book Mockingjay, I will pass.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love my Kindle app.  It does everything I want and more.  I have two comments though.  1) Updates are too frequent, especially when it means you have to re-download your books.  2)  I desperately miss the silhouette on the splash screen.  It made me feel like I was going somewhere peaceful, beautiful and special every time I opened the app.  The new gray w/ orange text is so blah and lacking!  Please bring back the old splash screen!

B003ES61EE|5.0|There are a lot of these kinds of things out there to help you clean the dust and fingerprints off of your lenses, this one is great for the price.  Decided I needed to get one after a few family photos got ruined from a fingerprint on a lens and the sun hitting it just right.  Even better than removing those are the bristles that I now use every time I take my camera out to clean off the dust that gets on the lens.  Awesome.

While I have always enjoyed their music, I was disappointed with the lackluster effort from \\"California 37\\". Don't get me wrong, there are a few decent tracks but nothing that stands out.<br /><br />\\"Drive By\\" seems to be the only stand out track from this album.
0439023521|3.0|I enjoyed this book, as long as I kept in mind that it is geared towards junior high age children. As an adult reader I felt the characters lacked depth and the book lacked details needed to make it truly interesting for my taste. Oh and I just saw the movie...don't waste your time.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|I'm not a huge multitool user, usually what I need I can get with just a small screwdriver set I keep in my laptop case.  But sometimes that just doesn't cut it.  I've had a few multitools that didn't really work out well, poorly constructed, just feel cheap.  No good grip since they were all just metal.<br /><br />This one actually feels decent in the hand.  The rubber sections on the handles give a good grip.  The spring action on the pliers is handy.  And for once, I have a small multitool that the pliers ends actually line up.  If I torque the handles in opposite directions I can get them to be just a tiny bit offset, but that's it.  Most others started out more offset than these can get when I force them.<br /><br />Only downside is getting the tools out of the ends - most of the other ones I've had were like pocket knives, with a small groove you can get a fingernail into in order to pull them out.  These don't.  They have small notches in the ends nearest the pivot point for all but one tool on each end, that you can try to pivot them up with, but there's little leverage since they're right by the pivot, not at the ends of the tools.  And the biggest saw on one of the ends has a tiny notch at the very end, but it's nearly impossible for me to get at since I trim my nails, so they're not long.  Tip - if you pull on the release they're a little easier to pivot out since there's no resistance as they lock into place.<br /><br />The release lock works well, keeping the tool you are using extended without it folding back in, then it pivots smoothly back when you slide the release.<br /><br />Feels nice and solid, has a good grip, so it's the best I've gotten so far, but a few refinements would've made it a little better.

As an act of faith, Pi takes on Hinduism, Islam, and Catholicism without any problems of contradiction. Soon, his faith is tested as he is shipwrecked in the Pacific with a strange companion to share a lifeboat.<br /><br />There is much to this book. It's an easy read in terms of story, but there are many aspects that require reflection and discussion. While I disagree with some of the notions of Yann's religion and his worldview, I do feel like it is an excellent portrayal of struggling to live and struggling to believe.<br /><br />Yann Martel is a formidable writer who created a wonderful story that you'll think about long after you close the book. In fact, you'll even question whether the story you just read really is the story you just read.<br /><br />As one of the people in the book says, \\"This story will make you believe in God.\\"<br /><br />The movie version is coming out 12/2012. I'm eager to see how it will work considering much of the novel is philosophical musing. I'm also eager to see how Tobey Maguire can play a teenaged Indian boy.

I'm pleased to tell you that Philadelphia Classics-The Tom Moulton Remixes has been well worth the wait, featuring thirty-one Philly classics, including seventeen brand new remixes. Truly, the music is stunning, having spent some time just reveling in the magnificence of the music. It's a fitting tribute to Tom Moulton, a man who is an innovator, and whose influence on dance music has been huge. Without Tom Moulton, there would have been neither remixes nor twelve inch singles, and doubtless, the history of DJ-ing would be very different.  Single-handedly Tom invented both the remix and twelve inch single, while creating some of the best remixes in the history of music. Before I tell you about the music on Philadelphia Classics-The Tom Moulton Remixes, I'll tell how Tom Moulton inadvertently invented both the remix and twelve inch single.<br /><br />How Tom Moulton invented the remix is a fascinating tale of how fate and being in the right place at the right time can change history. Throughout Tom's career, he'd been steeped in music, working firstly  as a junior promo man for United Artists, RCA and then King Records from the late fifties onwards. By the late sixties and disillusioned with the dishonesty and corruption that scarred music, Tom left the music industry. From there, he became a model, working on photographic shoots and on the catwalk. While he was making a living, his real passion was music. However, when a colleague  invited him to Fire Island to club the Sandpiper, he'd have a eureka moment that would change his life and music.<br /><br />Having arrived at Fire Island, Tom headed to the Sandpiper, where he'd change musical history. When watching a DJ mix the old seven inch singles, he realized that just when dancers were gaining momentum and getting into the groove, the single was over. After this there another single was mixed in and the same thing was happening. Realizing this must be hugely frustrating for dancers and DJs, Tom decided to rectify the problem.<br /><br />Back home, he spend nearly a week editing a forty-five minute reel-to-reel tape designed keep the dance floor going. Now this wasn't easy. He extended parts of tracks, looping the most exciting parts and ensured there was a seamless changeover between tracks, so much so, that dancers hardly noticed it. Using his own collection of soul music, the tape was compiled, but this hadn't been easy. It meant editing the tape using razor blades, tape and fluid, constantly joining and rejoining the tape. Dexterity, patience, skill and an ear for music were needed, but Tom had all that. So after a week, the tape was finished, and was given to a DJ at the Sandpiper. The result was as he'd expected, the dance-floor loved it. This would be Tom's first step on the road to remixer extraordinaire.<br /><br />Having made his first disco mix, Tom set about finding tracks to remix. This turned out to be relatively easy, mainly because Tom wasn't a DJ. The reason for this was radio was still King, with DJ's in clubs and record companies neither communicating nor perceived as important in the great scheme of thing. This is very different from today. So, when Tom approached record companies to remix one of their tracks, then often they say yes. Starting with The Carstairs' It Really Hurts Me Girl, remixed by Tom for Red Coach Records, Tom's nascent remixing career was underway. By 1974, Tom Moulton had perfected his craft, remixing BT Express' Do It Till You're Satisfied. Although the group didn't like the track, Tom's remix became a big hit. Suddenly, Tom was remixing  Loleatta Holloway, Eddie Kendricks and First Choice. By now he'd arrived, with the Tom Moulton remix a surefire sign of quality. Having invented the remix inadvertently, fate intervened again, with Tom inventing the twelve inch single.<br /><br />The first twelve inch single was made cut purely because of fate and a shortage of seven inch singles. After remixing I'll Be Holding On by Al Downing, Tom took that remix to have an acetate cut. However, when the single was going to be cut, engineer Jose Rodriguez realized that there were no seven inch singles left, so cut it on a twelve inch single. When Tom saw this, he realized that it didn't look right. It looked like a seven inch single on a twelve inch piece of vinyl. Then Tom hit on the idea of spreading grooves so that they reached the end of the vinyl. The effect this had was to increase the volume and dynamic range because the groove was much wider. This mean the music was much louder than other singles, resulting in clubs and DJs complaining that the single nearly blowing their speakers. This begs the question, why didn't they just adjust the volume?<br /><br />Although they might have complained about volume, they liked the break midway through Al Downing's I'll Be Holding On. Everything bar drums and percussion dropped out and then the started to rebuild. This was Tom's way of dealing with a key change. He gradually took out parts one by one, leaving merely drums and percussion. This breakdown grabbed the attention of record companies, DJs and dancers, with people asking why didn't Tom put these breakdowns in other records. After this Tom would add breakdowns to other tracks, something that's since been copied by remixers worldwide. However, the next step in Tom's career would see him Philly bound, where he'd remix some of his most famous mixes for Philadelphia International Records, which cane be heard on Philadelphia Classics-The Tom Moulton Remixes.<br /><br />In 1974 Tom discovered the Philly Devotions' I Just Can't Say Goodbye on the Don De label. Having worked on the track at home, Tom tookthis to Columbia Records in New York. They loved what he'd done, and wanted him to remix the track. Although Columbia offered to send the tapes to New York, Tom decided to head to Philadelphia, having fallen in love with the Philly Sound.<br /><br />Once he'd moved to Philadelphia, Tom fell in love with the city and its slower pace of life. He was constantly in demand. Having established himself in Philly, Tom hooked up with the two men who'd responsible for the Philly Sound, Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff. Gamble and Huff and Tom Moulton met through The Trammps manager Harry Chipetz. At first, Tom thought that Gamble and Huff hadn't any need for Tom's help. However, eventually, Harry Chipetz brought Tom into the \\"Philly family.\\" Initially, Harry brought the forthcoming albums about to be released, to see whether Tom could do anything with the music. The first song Tom chose was a People's Choice track Do It Any Way You Wanna. However, when Tom first got involved with the Philly Sound, there was a backlash against with music coming out of Philly.<br /><br />The problem was some people in the black community felt that the Philly Sound was being transformed into music for white people, with the addition of strings and horns. Tom like many people, was amazed and even annoyed. Tom decided to make a point, but needed the right track. He chose the People's Choice track Do It Any Way You Wanna, mixing it without strings or horns. This would dispel the accusation that Philly were making soul music for white people. He offered to do the song without taking a fee, but asked for his name to be put on the label, which it wasn't. On the release of Do It Any Way You Wanna, it became a huge hit, reaching number one in the US R&B Charts, while reaching the top twenty in the US Billboard 100. This would be the start of a long and fruitful relationship between Tom and Philadelphia International Records. Gamble and Huff would supply the soundtrack to the seventies and early eighties, with much of this music being remixed by Tom Moulton.<br /><br />After the success of People's Choice single Do It Any Way You Wanna, Harry Chipetz approached Tom with an idea to produce an album entitled Philadelphia Classics, complete with a cover of an old Rolls Royce on the album cover. This was because Harry saw the music as rich and classy, which it really is. There was one caveat, Tom couldn't include M.F.S.B.'s Love Is the Message, as it had already been a hit. However, Tom wasn't keen, because Love Is the Message was the track he desperately wanted to remix. Eventually, the label changed their mind, allowing Love Is the Message to be on the album. This changed Tom's mind and his album of remixes went ahead, including Love Is the Message, the song which he's most proud of. The resulting album was a huge success, and  over the next few years, Tom became Philadelphia International Records' go-to-guy for remixes. Tom remixed many of the label's biggest singles, with many of these tracks featuring on Philadelphia Classics-The Tom Moulton Remixes, which I'll now tell you about.<br /><br />DISC 1.<br /><br />Philadelphia Classics-The Tom Moulton Remixes is a four-disc box set which features thirty-one tracks. These track are chronologically arranged, with Disc One covering the period between 8 July 1972 and the release of The O'Jays' Back Stabbers to 6 October 1973 and the release of The Three Degrees' Dirty Ol' Man. In total, there are eight tracks on Disc One, with tracks from Philly giants The O'Jays who have two tracks on Disc One, while Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes, Billy Paul and The Three Degrees have one apiece. The other three tracks include a duo from The Intruders and one from Johnny Williams. Among the highlights of Disc One are The O'Jays' Back Stabbers and Love Train, Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes' The Love I Lost and Billy Paul's The Whole Town's Laughing At Me, which I'll tell you about.<br /><br />The O'Jays released Back Stabbers on 8 July 1972, whilst Tom mixed the track in September 2011. This was from The O'Jays debut album for Philadelphia International Back Stabbers, reaching number ten in the US Billboard 200 and number three in the US R&B Charts. When released as a single, Back Stabbers reached number three in the US Billboard 100 and number one in the US R&B Charts. Opening with flourish of piano, rhythm section and chiming guitars that combine with lush sweeping strings, the introduction is extended by Tom. This gives way to the vocal, which is frustrated and angry vocal. Quickly, the lead vocal changes hands. Behind them a stunning arrangement unfolds. It's an infectious combination of dramatic, yet beautiful music, thanks to the combination of lush strings, chiming guitars, piano and drums, while the horns and rhythm section deliver punchy, brief bursts of drama. When combined with the vocal the result is an O'Jays classic, made even better by Tom's near ten minute masterpiece of a mix.<br /><br />Billy Paul was Philadelphia International's male superstar, releasing a string of successful albums, including 1974s War of the Gods, which reached number 110 in the US Billboard 200 and number twelve in the US R&B Charts. It featured The Whole Town's Talking which Tom remixed in December 2011, totally transforming the track. The tempo is quicker, with a myriad of swirling strings, percussion and the rhythm section combining, during an extended introduction, before giving way to Billy's vocal. It's soft, full of sadness and regret, accompanied by backing vocalists. Behind him, the strings sweep, while the punchy rhythm section inject drama as Billy's vocal grows in power. Flourishes of piano, percussion and the rhythm section combine when Billy's vocal drops out, before the strings rejoin and the track starts to rebuild. Tom's decision to extend this part of the track and highlight the frenzied, flourishes of piano is a masterstroke. After that Billy and his backing vocalists rejoin, as the track heads to its glorious finish, with an emotive and impassioned vamp from Billy. Truly, this is an irresistible remix from Tom Moulton, the godfather of the remix.<br /><br />One of the biggest groups on Philadelphia International were Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes, with The Love I Lost one of the many highlights of the Teddy Pendergrass era. This track was from their Black and Blue album, released in September 1973, reaching number five in the US R&B Charts and fifty-seven in the US Billboard 200. When The Love I Lost was released as a single, it reached number seven in the US Billboard Hot 100 singles' charts and reached number one in the R&B Charts. Originally it was meant to be recorded as a ballad, but Kenny Gamble the cowriter and producer asked the group to speed the song up, and sing it with a swagger. In doing so, this transformed the track. Keyboards, then chiming guitars enter, before the pounding drums and strings sweep in. Here, Tom extends the glorious introduction, building up the drama, and providing the perfect backdrop for Teddy's impassioned vocal. Meanwhile, the rest of the group compliment his lead vocal with tight harmonies, against an arrangement that's dramatic and emotive. M.F.S.B., Philadelphia International's house band surpassing themselves, producing a impassioned and dramatic arrangement. Here, Tom Moulton extends the track to over twelve minutes, allowing you to revel in the emotion and sadness of a true Philly classic, as a seminal arrangement reveals itself.<br /><br />During the time The Three Degrees spent with Philadelphia International they recorded the best music of their career. This included The Three Degrees which reached number twenty-eight in the US Billboard 200 and thirty-three in the US R&B Charts. Dirty Ol' Man only reached number fifty-eight in the US R&B Charts on its release as a single. As the track opens, the tempo is quick, with the arrangement having a fuller sound. Swirling, lush strings, a punchy rhythm sectionand chiming guitars are at the heart of the arrangement while Sheila's voice is loud and scathing.  She's accompanied by Valerie and Fayette's equally powerful, backing vocals, which later become softer and subtle. Throughout the track the tempo is quick, with no let up in what's a catchy, bright and sweeping arrangement. Part of the track's success is down to the way the strings, guitars and quick, punchy rhythm section combine. Add to that the excellent vocals and it's a winning combination. Remixed by Tom in October 1976, his remix adds to the track's drama and emotion, highlighting the excellent arrangement and scathing vocals from Sheila.<br /><br />DISC TWO.<br /><br />On Disc Two of Philadelphia Classics-The Tom Moulton Remixes the music covers the period from the release of The Trammps Love Epidemic on 29 December 1973, through to their single Trusting Heart on 23 November 1974. During this period, several of Philadelphia International's most memorable tracks were released, including T.S.O.P. The Sound of Philadelphia by M.F.S.B. and The Three Degrees and the remix Tom Moulton is most proud of M.F.S.B.'s Love Is the Message. Meanwhile, The Trammps were going through the hottest period of their career, thanks to the Baker, Harris, Young rhythm section. Disc Two features four tracks from The Trammps, two from M.F.S.B. and The Three Degrees, plus Robert Upchurch's The Devil Made Me Do It. With so many great tracks, choosing the highlights isn't easy, but here goes.<br /><br />T.S.O.P. The Sound of Philadelphia by M.F.S.B. and The Three Degrees reached number one in the US R&B and Billboard 100, and number twenty-two in the UK.  Opening quickly, a hugely melodic, soulful vocal is accompanied by cascading strings, rhythm section and percussion before it's punctuated by bursts of horns. Quickly, this soulful sounding track is transformed into a beefy slice of funk, thanks to M.F.S.B. Then a rasping horn signals all change. This doesn't worry The Three Degrees. They rise to this challenge. Their voices unite sweetly and soulfully, while M.F.S.B. give a funk laden masterclass. It's a combination of driving rhythm section, blazing horns, percussion and not forgetting some grand, yet lush strings. Here, the vocal plays second fiddle to the arrangement, with the vocal drifting in and out of the arrangement. Still they give everything they have, as M.F.S.B. seemingly having brought their A-game produce a brilliant arrangement, funky yet soulful, made all the better with the help of The Three Degrees' soulful interjections.<br /><br />Where Do We Go From Here by The Trammps was released on 18 May 1974 and remixed by Tom in 1977. Featuring the legendary Baker, Harris, Young rhythm section and the vocal of Jimmy Ellis, this is one of The Trammps best tracks. Cascading strings, the rhythm section and backing vocalists combine as the track opens. The drums have Earl Young's trademark sound, before the track heads to an extended string drenched break. When Jimmy's vocal enter, it's powerful and impassioned, accompanied by backing vocalists, while the strings sweep and swirl and the rhythm section drive the track along contributing drama and emotion. Listening to this track is quite poignant, given the sad death of Jimmy Ellis recently, but this track demonstrates his talent as a soul vocalist. Add in the greatest rhythm section of the seventies and give the track to the godfather of the remix Tom Mouton, and the result is five minutes of emotion, passion and drama.<br /><br />Of all the tracks in the Philadelphia International back-catalogue, the one Tom wanted to remix was M.F.S.B.'s Love Is the Message, released in July 1974. Anyone who knows the track will realise why. Once Tom got the opportunity to remix the track in September 1976, this became a career defining track, lasting over eleven minutes. This is Tom's Magnus Opus, the remix he's most proud of. When the track opens it's a mass of the lushest strings, blazing horns, percussion and the rhythm section. From its soulful beginnings, the track quickly decides to reveal its drama and delights. On the signal of the drums, a sizzling saxophone solo enter, while Lenny Pakula's Hammond adds atmosphere. After that, the track briefly heads in a direction marked funk, before returning to its soulful sound. Later, the Three Degrees add their soulful strains, as the track combines soul and funk seamlessly. With Tom looping and extending parts, building up drama, then breaking it down, only to rebuild, no wonder he's so proud of this track. He truly should be, it truly is one of his greatest remixes, one blessed with a contemporary, timeless sound, that sounds as good today as in 1976.<br /><br />DISC THREE.<br /><br />By Disc Three of Philadelphia Classics-The Tom Moulton Remixes we've got to the period between the release of Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes' Bad Luck on 15 March 1973 and the release of People's Choice Jam, Jam, Jam (All Night Long) on 15 January 1977. This includes music from Archie Bell and The Drells, Lou Rawls, The O'Jays and People's Choice. Truly, it's a veritable feast crammed full of the finest Philly soul. Again, choosing from such a feast of music is problematic, what to choose and what to leave out. Anyway, here goes.<br /><br />Bad Luck was a track from Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes 1975 album To Be True, which reached number twenty-six in the US Billboard 200 and number one in the US R&B Charts, resulting in the group's only album to be certified gold. The track has a bold, punchy introduction with the rhythm section, piano and percussion combining before Teddy's powerful, passionate vocal enters. Strings enter, sweeping and swirling above Teddy's vocal as he rues his Bad Luck. Then the rest of the group enter, contributing joyous, sweet backing vocals, as Teddy's vocal takes centre-stage. Punchy, rasping horns enter as Teddy starts to vamp his way through this anthemic track. Like so many of Tom's remixes, it has an irresistible, dramatic sound during its eight minutes. Not only has he the uncanny ability to know exactly what will work best, by extending and looping parts of the track, but his remixes have a timeless quality and are deserving of the work classic in the compilation's title.<br /><br />Lou Rawls' You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine is one of his best known tracks. It's from his All Things In Time album, released in June 1976. It reached number seven in the US Billboard 200 and number one in the US R&B Charts. When You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine was released as a single, it reached number two in the US Billboard 100, and number one in the US R&B Charts and US Dance Charts. What makes the track work so well is how Bobby Martin's arrangement and Lou's vocal unite. They compliment each other perfectly. Piano and rhythm section combine before Lou's slow, smooth, sensuous vocal enters. As Lou sings, it's almost call and response between Lou and the piano. He leaves a space which the piano fills dramatically. Then when the tempo increases, with drums, rasping horns and the piano adding brief flourishes of drama, Lou's voice rises, becoming stronger, full of emotion and passion. Meanwhile, female backing vocalists cut in, their gentle voices a contrast to Lou's powerful vocal. What makes this track is an arrangement that builds and builds. Layer upon layer of sumptuous music reveals itself, with the rhythm section and piano key to success of the track, with the horns adding just the finishing touch. Add to this Lou's fantastic vocal, and the result is one of the best songs Lou Rawls ever recorded made even better by Tom's magnificent mix recorded in September 2011.<br /><br />Opening with a slow sultry saxophone solo, Where Will You Go When The Party's Over by Archie Bell and The Drells quickly reveals its beauty. Joining the saxophone are hissing hi-hats, the rhythm section, keyboards and cascading strings. Together they produce a sound that's sweet anddramatic. Then, the backing vocalists enter, before the strings and rhythm section drive the track along. Punchy, rasping horns enter before Archie's vocal enters. It's sassy and impassioned, accompanied by sensuous backing vocalists. With strings and horns accompanying Archie, the track takes on a joyous and uplifting sound that's irresistible. By now the track has an anthemic quality. After the emotion and passion of the track, Tom inserts a break after five minute, allowing dancers to get their breath back. It's just the piano and horn that combine, before Archie's vocal reenters, becoming a vamp, as the track starts to rebuild gradually. By he end of this nine minute epic, you can only marvel at the talents of Tom Moulton. Using his considerable talent and a dancer's ear, he remixed this track in December 2011, resulting in an anthemic, dance-floor classic for the twenty-first century.<br /><br />DISC FOUR.<br /><br />The fourth and final disc of Philadelphia Classics-The Tom Moulton Remixes covers the period between the release of Teddy Pendergrass' I Don't Love You Anymore on 30 April until the release of The Jones Girls Nights Over Egypt on 13 February 1982. This period covers the end of Teddy Pendergrass' time with Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes and the start of his solo career. It also covers tracks from Philadelphia International veterans The O'Jays, through Lou Rawls second album and albums by  Blue Notes and the start of his solo career. It also covers tracks from Philadelphia International newcomers Jean Carn and The Jones Girls. Really, it covers the changing of the guard, with old favorites saying farewell to the label, new careers being launched and the next generation of artists signing for the label. This was an exciting time, as you'll discover when I tell you about the highlights of Disc Four of Philadelphia Classics-The Tom Moulton Remixes.<br /><br />I Don't Love You Anymore was from Teddy Pendergrass' solo album Teddy Pendergrass. Releasedin June 1977, it reached number seventeen in the US Billboard 200 and number five in the US R&B Charts, while I Don't Love You Anymore, reached number five in the US R&B Charts and forty-one in the US Billboard 100. Opening with percussion, before blazing horns and swirling strings combine to provide a backdrop for Teddy's quick, passionate vocal. Adding to an already joyful upbeat sound are piano, strings and backing vocalists whose voices unite soulfully. Later shimmering guitars interject, combining with a piano during a mini-breakdown. Then Teddy's vocal drops way down, before quickly returning to it's previous joyful, impassioned sound. Tom's remix from October 2011 takes the song and combines Teddy's impassioned vamp with a dramatic, string and horn drenched arrangement. In doing so, he transforms it, adding to it's drama and passion, while giving it a contemporary sound.<br /><br />Of the tracks Lou Rawls recorded for Philadelphia International, my favorite is See You When I Git There, from his Unmistakably Lou album, released in May 1977. It didn't match the success of All Things In Time, reaching just number forty-one in the US Billboard 200 and number fourteen in the US R&B Charts. When See You When I Git There was released as a single, it only reached number sixty-six in the US Billboard 100 and number eight in the US R&B Charts. This is an uptempo track with a real feel-good sound, with pounding drums, an organ and chiming guitars combining during the extended introduction. They give way to a husky spoken word introduction from Lou. After this, the track quickens up, a lovely lush sound string laden sound, combining with percussion, rasping horns, rhythm section and guitars. Lou's vocal is full of love and emotion, with female backing vocalists accompanying him. His vocal about going home to the woman he loves in beautiful, especially when sung against Bobby Martin's stunning arrangement. The lush strings, rhythm section and guitars combine beautifully with the keyboards, and occasional bursts of horns. For me, this was one of the highlights of Lou's career with Philadelphia International, given its timeless sound. Tom's remix from November 2011 takes a great track and makes it even better, turning it into ten minutes of beautiful, lush string drenched music.<br /><br />This Time Baby was a single from The O'Jays album So Full of Love. It reached number one in the US R&B Charts and number six in the US Billboard 200.Originally  arranged and produced by Thom Bell, a combination of swirling, sweeping strings, driving rhythm section, piano and guitars open the extended introduction. This builds and builds for three minutes, before a flourish of drums and strings eventually signal the entrance of the vocal. Against a quick arrangement, Eddie's vocal enters. Meanwhile, Walt and Sammy contribute backing vocals, while blazing horns, swirling strings and a punchy rhythm section combine to create a fast, driving arrangement. Combined with the powerful vocal, it's a winning combination, with the original four minute track transformed into a ten minute epic. What I love about Tom's remix, is how the track builds and builds. It takes three minutes before the vocal enters. The sense of anticipation is tantalizing, as you await to see how Tom will structure the track. Thankfully the anticipation is matched by the delivery on another of Tom's new remixes from December 2011.<br /><br />My final choice from Philadelphia Classics-The Tom Moulton Remixes is the final  track on the album, The Jones Girls, Nights Over Egypt, from their 1980 album Get As Much Love As You Can. Nights Over Egypt still retains the magical, timeless sound it had back in 1980. Opening with hissing hi-hats, the mystical, meandering introduction begins. A combination of synths, rhythm section, harp and acoustic piano combine. The funkiest of basses plays its part before the sisters unite to sing gentle, tight harmonies. Their voices grow in strength and power,as the  arrangement peaks, before giving way to a lush, almost mystical and exotic sound, before lush strings sweep and swirl, as the vocal rejoins. Jack Faith plays flute on the track, while gentle, rasping horns escape from the arrangement. By the end of the track, you realize that you've been fortunate enough to hear a classic remix, never before released from the godfather of the remix, Tom Moulton, a true musical genius and innovator.<br /><br />Like the music on the previous three discs, Disc Four of Philadelphia Classics-The Tom Moulton Remixes the music is just as good. This demonstrates Tom's talent as a remixer. It's a combination of classics and new tracks, with the music is of the highest quality. With the new tracks, Tom's remixes are just as good as his older remixes, demonstrating that he's still a hugely talented remixer. In fact, listening to these tracks, there much better than anything the new generation of remixers are producing. Compare these tracks, and its like master and pupil, with Tom very much the master. Other remixers are just pretenders to Tom's throne. For nearly forty years, Tom Moulton has been remixing music, with his remixes some of the most innovative and influential in the history of music. Without Tom Moulton, music, especially dance music wouldn't be the same. There would be no remixes, no twelve inch singles and maybe, no superstar DJs. Instead, DJs would still be scrambling about mixing seven inch singles, with dancers suffering when the momentum they'd built up dropped as they'd just got into the groove. Of course maybe another DJ would've invented the remix, but would fate have intervened for them and the twelve inch single have been born? Who knows, but they wouldn't have had the influence, skill and determination Tom Moulton would have on music. I doubt it. Truly, Tom Moulton is one of the real heroes of music. On 26 March 2012, Philadelphia Classics-The Tom Moulton Remixes a stunning four disc box set of thirty-one of his remixes will be released by Harmless Records. This gives everyone the opportunity to either rediscover or discover the genius of Tom Moulton, inventor of the remix, twelve inch single and remixer extraordinaire. Standout Tracks: Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes The Love I Lost, M.F.S.B. Love Is the Message, Archie Bell and The Drells Where Will You Go When The Party's Over and Teddy Pendergrass I Don't Love You Anymore.<br /><br />-Derek Anderson
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love playing games like this would recommend. this to any one great fun for any ages. I can pick it up for a few minutes and be good
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Your game play isn't compromised by the ads. The games are basic but fun. I think it's a decent app for the price (FREE) and challenging to try to unlock other games.
B000002L42|5.0|I love this band.  Good clean sound, nice song selection and great sounding touring band.  This band doesnt tour much and when I realized this was a live recording I was very interested.....could they reproduce there sound in a live setting? Yes to my great pleasure.  If you like this bands studio stuff check out them in a live settiing, I think you wwill enjooy it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Been using Catch for 9+ months and the ultra-simplicity grew tiresome; not to mention that the web version was changed until useless. Evernote provides all of the features and more, but is very usable and intuitive.
B0036OS3JM|5.0|These boots are very comfortable, totally waterproof and so easy to wear! I wear 6 and a half and bought a size 7 that fits perfectly with snow socks. I definitely recommend them to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am having a hard time putting this one down.  Usually only Harlan COben books have that affect with me!  Looking forward to reading other 2 in this trilogy!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Contrary to most reviews, I enjoyed this book. I'm a late 20's female and as someone that has read hardcore BDSM stories, I thought this novel was good. It wasn't hardcore, but it was written in a way that made you feel just a little dirty reading it. I agree with some of the other writers, some of the descriptive phrases were redundant; the main character bites her lip on pretty much every page and the phrase \\"I will take you now\\" is completely overused. Overall, I enjoyed it.
0446585025|5.0|I read this book while at the hospital with my wife and I finished it basically in one sitting.  It was a quick read and it was a lot of fun.  Basically think Ellen's talk show but in a book.  At times quite random, at other times hilarious, and at other times not so funny.  But hey you can't ALWAYS be happy/laughing can you?<br /><br />Ellen writes long chapters, she writes short chapters and she connects with her audience and the reader in a way that makes you not want to put the book down.  Under the circumstances I was in, it was easy to just read it from start to finish while waiting in the ER, but I would have to say, reading this over a few days would have been just as much fun.<br /><br />If you like Ellen's show you will like this book, I would recommend reading it. Something fun and light.<br />[...]
B004P1JDJO|5.0|Very engaging and easy to read. Eye opening, great for work! I would recommend it to anyone working in the fields of organizational development and leadership, but really anyone can enjoy it.
B0062QRTKA|1.0|bad totally mocks God and the Bible. HORRIBLE APP don't get!! Makes fun of the Bible miracle of the parting of the red sea!
B0065AVS0K|5.0|I'm not really sure what movie you saw, but I thought the way Robert Rodriguez was able to bring Frank Miller's graphic novel Sin City to life was fantastic. I loved everything about this movie and I wouldn't change a thing. If you are a Frank Miller fan, which I know Frank has his haters, then you will love this movie as much as I did. I can't wait for the sequel...
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Oh Holy Goodness did I love this book!  I read it so fast the first time, because I could not put it down, that I read it over to make sure I didn't miss anything.  I know there have been a few comments on how disturbing the relationship between Abby and Travis is, but, I thought it was so wonderful reading about two people trying their hardest to overcome their demons, and finding that one person who is willing to overlook their faults and love them for who they are and who they are trying to become.  Jamie McGuire...thank you so much.  Please keep the books coming.
B000005IZ8|4.0|\\"Powaggatsi\\" is the second in the trilogy of \\"Qatsi\\" movies, this one released in 1988, which Philip Glass provided the soundtrack for (as he did for the other two, of course).<br /><br />\\"Powaqqatsi\\" (18 tracks; 74 min.) brings almost the totality of the movie's soundtrack, and it is a thrilling listen. It kicks off with the rousing, almost startling \\"Sera Pelada\\", sounding very different from the first movie. Eventually, though, the sound becomes more in line with \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\", and that is a great thing. The center piece on here is the 3 tracks (which really are just one long 11 min. track) called \\"New Cities in Ancient Lands\\" (China, Africa, India), just tremendous and this is worth buying just for this. I cannot rate this soundtrack 5 stars, as I did for \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\", as this lacks the element of surprise and it misses the explamantion signature sound such as was the booming voice that provided the \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" title track. But let there be no mistake, \\"Powaqqatsi\\" is very good as well.<br /><br />If you wonder why I am listening to this again, it's because a few weeks ago was \\"Philip Glass week in Cincinnati\\". He performed at the MusicNow festival, and his \\"Cello Concerto No. 2\\" got its world premiere at the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. (That concerto is based in part on his soundtrack for the 3rd \\"Quatsi\\" movie, incidentally.) Meanwhile, the \\"Powaqqatsi\\" soundtrack is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angrybirds is a fun game that anyone can play.Sometimes my dad plays it.I hope everyone likes it. I love this app!
B004EPZ07K|1.0|Even on blu-ray, it was a 2-hour-long TOM SERVO moment. Go with the $5 direct-to-video \\"[[ASIN:B003DFNUBA The Green Lantern: First Flight]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B0054RY6HW Green Lantern: Emerald Knights]].\\" Both have better stories.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|you should try it. so much fun if I could I would play this game all day if I could I would
B007JRU2UK|1.0|It took several hours to download at the airport and I was not able to view the video until my return trip which was 3 days later but the video had expired.  I paid for the video but did not download it to be able to view it.!!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I absolutely love it!  Bright vivid pint shell is sturdy, light, and soooo pretty!<br />The top cover (black side) folds over to be a stand. It's fabic material picks up dusts and wears out at crease.  Great value!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love that I can take this with me wherever I go. also love that you can view scriptures in your usual version or compare it to another version.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was amazing!  I cannot wait for the second one in the series to be published this summer!  I also heard rumors of a movie!  Amazing and enthralling story that absorbs you completely!
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Lady Antebellum is great, and they continue to show it on this second album.  Item was brand new and shipped promptly. Thanks :)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a great trilogy of books!  It was absorbing and I was actively involved in reading.  There was just enough imagery to really make you feel like you were in Katnis' shoes!
B004WOS7LO|5.0|I love David Cook, and he has made another great album. Item was in perfect shape, and sent very promptly. Thanks :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm 13 and I love this game. all you have to do to get back to the homescreen is click on the bottom right button in the corner and click options. the littlebar with the arrrow will pop up.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I love Daughtry, and this is another great album by him. Item was in perfect shape, and was shipped promptly. Thanks :)
0345803485|5.0|This is one of those books I just couldn't put down.  When I told my friends about it I said just go ahead and get all three.  You will be dying for the next one!!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Great series for anyone who is wondering. Riveting performances, great story lines. Item was in perfect shape and shipped promptly. Thanks :)
B0052VUNHC|5.0|The harshly dominant bad boy meets the sweet cardigan wearing school girl...with a twist.  I appreciate a romance that gives me more to think about, and this book did just that.  I was shocked, angry, happy, laughing, and fanning myself at opportune moments.  Not your common romance - no one is perfect here.  Each has problems - such is life for many.  College days, hormone-induced territorial fights, bad decisions, and youthful contemplative dreams withstanding, the portrayal of growing young love and its inevitable flaws shine through.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it great fun for the whole family my daughter fights me for the kindle now its her game
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love novels that push my literary boundaries, invoke a mangled mix-up of emotions, and leave me thinking long after I'm finished reading.  Book Two of the Fifty Shades Trilogy  further led me into a darkly inventive story and deeper into the driving demons of the highly flawed Christian.  Heated, detailed sex scenes abound, thoughts are further provoked, and possibly love finds a way.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun, fun, fun, fun, entertaining, not hard to close or anything. Good time waster, great for slow times at work
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very detailed sex scenes, deeply thought-provoking  characters, shocking story line(s) and new-found love for a sadly deserving person, drive the novel.  When I bought this book(wary), I didn't expect what I got - but in a good way.  It kept me on my toes, interested, made me think...and think again.  The lead characters were so brilliantly flawed that I wasn't bored and felt a bundle of varied emotions all the way through.  I've read the second, as well, and have a further insight to the characters, which the author set up well middle to end in this first book.  I'm still thinking about it.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This is a horrible game - it's geared for children but they can with a click of a button charge your amazon account without their knowledge - our 6 year old loved playing the game and within 1 hour he had charged over $20.00. There is not a way that I can find to block it so that he can not charge my amazon account and still play the game - I was very dissapointed
0385342063|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is my all-time favorite author.  Every book has been a real treat!  But I thought this book might be too predictable.  I was really surprised.  First of all, you will love the main character, Poppy.  She is hilarious, sweet, and gullible.  She wants to please everyone, including her evil wedding planner and uptight in-laws.  She makes a new friend in Sam, while using his assistant's cell phone, and he is the exact opposite of her. He's very professional and serious.  They each inspire the other to change their ways.  There is also a big scandal they work on fixing together that will keep you turning the pages. While there is some predictability, I was also surprised throughout the book.  This is a fun read that will have you laughing out loud.  I highly recommend this book!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This  game is great.  Lots of mini goals to keep you working on it,  and plenty of coin rewards so you don't have to scramble to collect enough to keep the game moving forward,  like a lot of games like these do.  The graphics are amazing.  I cant believe this game is free.
B003B02O14|5.0|The protagonist (a lawyer) steals millions of dollars from his law firm and when he is caught and brought to trial he is able to negotiate a brilliant settlement and escape prison. But in a surprising twist all his briilliance leaves him destitute at the end.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|...you will STILL be waiting to see how I feel. It is entertaining for about 5 min and then your energy runs out. This game doesn't seem to know what direction it wants to go in. It is like Farmville in the sense that you have to wait for crops, animals and buildings to be harvested. You have to have the right supplies to build various stages of your buildings. BUT then you also need to use energy. So on top of having to wait for things to be ready, you have to wait for the energy to do it when it is ready.<br /><br />There is no smooth integration with Social Media, so when I finally broke down and tried to link my FB, it just force closed. Every time I have tried to \\"ask friends\\" for specific building materials to be able to move on, it force closes.<br /><br />Also, the screen is extremely sensitive which stinks when you have limited amounts of energy. I was trying to scroll and accidentally clicked a tree. Before I could cancel the action, I lost one energy.<br /><br />The people in my town are so unhappy-which reflects my mood every time I play.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|This is a great song, even if it does have cheesy lyrics and is very bubblegum. It has a well-crafted beat that is built on retro-disco strings. The lyrics are actually clever. It does feature a theme that has not been thought of before.  And they are so CATCHY.  With the excellent beat and irresistible lyrics, it is irrelevant that the song is cheesy. After all, it's pop music.<br /><br />Carly Rae Jepsen has just an okay voice in my opinion, though.  However, it's just as good as most of the pop artists out there and actually better than a handful of them. She's no Adele or even Rihanna, but it's better than Katy Perry.<br /><br />I look forward to see what's next from the Canadian starlet that came out of nowhere in America.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|good classic fun game play enjoyable easy controls challenging levels keeps player attention for hours of fun good times for all
B007MU85D0|4.0|\\"My Head Is An Animal\\" is the debut album of Icelandic indie folk-pop group Of Monsters and Men. The band is the 2010 winner of an annual music competition in Iceland.<br /><br />After hearing Of Monsters and Men's biggest hit \\"Little Talks\\" on alternative radio and AAA radio, I had to check them out more.  I am not big on indie folk-pop music, though I've been expanding my musical horizons recently (part of which, is by listening to AAA radio).<br /><br />Of Monsters and Men draw comparison to Mumford and Sons, Florence and the Machine, Arcade Fire, and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros.  And I heard shades of all of these artists on \\"My Head Is An Animal\\". I would also add, fellow Scandinavian indie folk-pop artist Lykke Li.  However, the music of Of Monsters and Men is more upbeat and sunnier than the above artists.<br /><br />With six band members, the songs on the album include lots of harmonizing and a slew of instrumentation, including ones uncommon for rock music, like the accordion and glockenspiel. The acoustic guitar is used more than the bass guitar (of course, they are folk based). Drums are used more often than other folk groups. The band's lead female singer (Nanna Bryndis) has a voice that reminds me of Florence Welsh, and the lead male singer (Ragnar) reminds me of Mumford & Sons.  The production and lyrics of the songs also remind me of Mumford and Sons.<br /><br />Overall, \\"My Head Is An Animal\\" is a good collection of songs. My favorite tracks on the album are \\"Dirty Paws\\", \\"King and Lionheart\\", \\"Mountain Song\\", \\"From Finner\\", \\"Little Talks\\" (of course), and \\"Love Love Love\\". Like \\"Little Talks\\", \\"Dirty Paws\\" and \\"Mountain Song\\" have a sing along chorus. \\"King and Lionheart\\" and \\"Love Love Love\\" are more somber.<br /><br />Of Monsters and Men will be one of the better folk-oriented indie groups on the charts for awhile.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm almost 30, and I really enjoy the Ice Age film series. This game gives me just another excuse to be a kid again! really fun easy to play and makes me laugh. not your typical &quot;village&quot; game but included also mini-games to pass the time along with an Ice Age Short that comes along with your movie theatre. Great job!!!
B0025KVLU6|5.0|The Beatles White Album, actually and orginally entitled \\"The Beatles\\", is a terrific porpourri of various songs and styles that brings back memories of the groups amazing versatility, instrumental expertise, and vocal variety.  I'ts a wonderful CD set and something any Beatles fan should not live without.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|ok now lets see if this computes.....the free version of angry birds space wont work on the kindle fire but the paid version will?<br />Listen amazon..isnt it bad enough that we HAVE to give a credit card to be able to get free app?<br />Y'know itunes doesnt have this restriction. And if your purpose is to  market yourselves as the itunes alternative then maybe you should try what makes them popular...no? Purpose is to lure customers, not push them away.<br /><br />\\"You can rebuild it,<br />You have the technology,<br />We can  make it stronger....better......faster!\\"
B00005JKLZ|5.0|Some movies just hit you on a personal level, and have all the right elements going on. Throughout the years, The Time Machine has remained my favorite film. Entertaining, emotional, dramatic, epic, and it has a truly amazing score. The Time Machine tells the story of Alexander Hartedgen, a brilliant young professor in New York at the turn of the 20th Century. In love with the girl of his dreams, Alexander proposes to Emma, only moments later to have her shot in front of his eyes by a crazed mugger. Alexander spends the next four lonely years building The Time Machine, an amazing machine that he utilizes to desperately try and save Emma from her dark fate.<br /><br />If you've never seen it, and you don't want to make the commitment to buy it, rent it on Netflix!<br />Give it a chance, it's a solid movie throughout.<br />It's not for everyone, but hopefully you're able to find some value in it.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|Fast service, exact! Beautiful special hiding place in a garden once neglected due to tragedy, a placecwere all can heal. Awesome story...perfect hideaway!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is almost exactly like Super Mario Bros. And it is free. There are many obstacles and traps. You can also gain weapons and coins. This game rocks.
0307592731|3.0|I'm about 100 pages through this book and have two observations.  One, I'm disappointed that people's names were altered, which is why I labeled this a \\"nonfiction novel\\".  It's akin to the license Norman Mailer took with \\"The Executioner's Song\\".  So far, this book isn't controversial or even borderline slanderous against any of the \\"characters\\".  So what's with the mystery about people's identities?  Perhaps backpackers in her circle are thin-skinned.  My other criticism has to do with the profanity Ms. Strayed uses.  Was it really necessary to use the f-word?  I realize American culture is becoming increasingly coarse, but there's no justifaction for this.  I enjoy outdoor books, and books about the PCT are rare.  I'm already sold on a book like this, so there's no need to be outrageous to attract my attention.  Guess I won't be able to recommend this book to any Boy Scouts.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it takes forever for your energy to refill itself but all in all its a fun game that's helps me kill time.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|OK, a lot has been said about this book, in a positive and a negative sense.<br />So, is it long? Yes. Is the romance depicted in a somewhat corny fashion? Yes.<br />Did it keep me awake for two nights because I wanted to finish it? Yes. Was I turning the pages with sweaty hands? Yes.<br />It's brilliant.<br />Read it.
B007UMLE5Q|5.0|This was one of the best episodes the series has ever done and maybe the best episode of any drama in the past year. It perfectly captured 1966 in so many ways and also captured most of the interesting aspects of nearly all the core characters. And its not what happens at the end, but the journey to get there that is very, very well done. Its one thing to center an episode around a single character, but this episode through incredible writing/acting manages to hit all the right notes with about seven or eight different characters at once. And it managed, at its core, to be about business in a credible and interesting way. Most of the characters, even characters like Lane, Peggy & Ken, had a depth to them in the episode thats rare in television.<br /><br />Everyong involved from the writers to the cast to the director should take credit for delivering something really outstanding in terms of television drama.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Received in a couple of days.  Great customer service.  Great CD. Today's sounds but something for everyone.  You won't be disappointed....loving it!
B004EPYZSK|4.0|The lighthearted title says it all: cowboys (western setting), aliens (well designed), and tongue-in-cheek storyline, with charming main characters played by good actors. The plot is smooth, photography is polished, and special effects are smartly rationed and well done. Harrison Ford plays backup to Indy-substitute Daniel Craig, who makes a fine anti-hero. Bear in mind that the show is based on a comic book, check your brain at the door, and enjoy the ride. The epilogue leaves just enough unanswered questions that I hope for a sequel.
B0061S0A64|3.0|it would be fun if the colored balls were labeled. simple enough to use though and i would have enjoyed playing if this app was fixed.also the volume is too quiet for me too hear it needs to be louder otherwise it works fine on the kindle fire.dont expect too much from something thats free not to say that free isnt good its great!
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|This cd is fantastic!!!  It is a great buy for an excellent price.  I wish I had known that they had an extended edition.  Overall, I wouldn't change my decision.  Hope to hear more music soon!
B005GK6QSO|5.0|Right up front:  I love Torsti Spoof and Leverage.  My expectaions were very high for this project because I knew that if Torsti focused on shorter songs with simpler arrangements and riffs he could nail it. He did! This thing has a wall of sound all it's own and shines with a hard rock glory which is rarely duplicated.  This is AOR with cranked up guitars and soaring vocals.  One thing though...I still want more Leverage!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love the ease of use and the convenience of this app. What I want to know, when I want to know.
B0079XNWQA|3.0|I have been a big fan of Jason Mraz for a while, seeing him live probably more then any other artist I have seen. I will say to start, once you have seen Jason Mraz live his studio recordings just never seem that great as you miss a lot of the personality that he brings to his shows. Now that being said, this album has been a bit of a letdown. Track after track just sounds like the same song, and I found myself getting bored quick. Gone are the days where he would mix up nicely between more up tempo and slow songs, get creative with the lyrics, and even inject some humor. I would still go see him live in a heartbeat, but man are his studio releases getting more and more difficult to support.

0345803485|1.0|Really pissed that I spent $10. Honestly...my 4th grader writes better than this. The editor should be fired and charged with crimes against literature. The plot had potential. If the editor had tried to teach the author how to craft a  decent sentence, I might have given it two stars. With some half way developed characters, three stars. As it stands, I can't even justify the one star. I would like to know what happens, but not badly enough to pay for the second and third books. I find it so sad that this is getting so much hype. People that think this is a good book must be reading some real crap.
0545405777|5.0|I have the complete trilogy purchased as separate books, but, only the first book-The Hunger Games-is available as a hardbound 'collector's edition.' So, I bought this more expensive hard cover version as a long term investment.  The story across the 3 books is remarkable, surely one of the best in the 'war and peace' genre since Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series.  I recommended on my fb page that The Hunger Games trilogy should be required reading in social studies or political science classes at the sophomore or junior level in high school.  My niece relayed that her husband's high school is teaching The Hunger Games in a 9th grade civics class.  Excellent.<br /><br />Now, I would recommend that you buy each of these books, if buying as hardbacks, in the dust-cover, not the so-called collector's edition.  This edition has a lovely, well-constructed slip cover, but, the book itself has no additional dust cover with the lovely art (as do books 2 and 3 not yet out in the \\"collector's\\" version.)  The Hunger Games collector's edition book binding is cheaper quality material in terms of both cover and the paper used for the pages, which are also crudely cut anyway compared to the hardcover books 2 and 3.  Not acceptable.  Buy all 3 hardcover books [[ASIN:0545405777 The Hunger Games - Collector's Edition]] separately only in the dust cover version!
0694013889|5.0|When I was a Nursery School teacher, I thought this book was perfect for parents to teach their very young children to pee pee and poo poo in the proper place, potty.  This book uses very easy to understand language for a 2 year old.  BTW, I taught nursery school in an evangelical church school.  there is NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS book's language and pictures.  It is a great book to read to your pre-potty trained child.  Actually is it a GREAT book.  But, if you find your spouse hiding and reading it, you might need to worry.

B004W2UBYW|2.0|I am only 300 pages into this book and, although the book gives great insight to Jobs and the computer industry, the writing is much to be desired.  I belong to 2 book clubs, plus I read many books in between meetings.  So, I can at least say that I can tell a \\"good\\" read from a \\"bad\\" read.  To me, it seemed as though the author was in a rush to get this book out.  There was absolutely no flow to the writing.  It was all over the place (just like Job's mind).  Perhaps the author wrote it that way on purpose to give his readers an idea of how Job's thought process worked.  I would have liked to have a script where the events were in chronological order instead of jumping back and forth in time.  I am not sure I want to finish the book, but I will wade through it.  I hope there will be other books in the future that are better written.
0062082353|5.0|While I was searching for another book to read, This book kept popping up as though \\"trying to get my attention\\". This told me I HAD to buy it.  So I DID!! I training for sniper/scout school, and was doing quite well at the time. At the time I was in heavy motors as my main M.O.S. so my passion was put on hold temporarily. At least until the real need for another qualified sniper is needed. Thanks Again >> Semper Fi  1Lt. R.E.McK aka:(Lt. Mac)<br />Keep up with the fine work you've been doing.
B0037XPP84|1.0|I love Elizabeth the movie and the blu ray is absolutely gorgeous to watch.  I didn't see the Golden Age until I recently bought the blu ray.  The movie is really bad. I was surprised at how little story there was. It plays like a beautifully photographed music video with no music.<br /><br />You see a lot of people hating Elizabeth with little or no explanation as to why other than the over used bastard, whore, heretic reasons/descriptions. Caricatures is a word to sum up all of the performances.  The Golden Age is a woefully poor sequel to a movie that was sheer pageantry.  Cate Blanchett in one of the featurettes said that she felt that she had gotten it all wrong.  I don't think that she should feel bad about this because they ALL got it wrong - especially the writers.<br /><br />Beautiful but not worth buying.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game. There are many games that require you to purchase items in order to finish the story but this one does not. You do have the option to purchase things with real money in the game but game play won't be affected if you choose not to spend anything which I love The only problem I have with the game is that it does cause an issue with getting back to the home screen. You can select your stuff bar click on options and choose customer care and it will take you to the Internet on the kindle and from there you can simply choose the home icon.  It is however a hassle and something I hope to see fixed.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|If you could have just ONE 3D Blu-Ray DVD in your library - this is the one.<br /><br />I've watched many - and this stands tall above all the rest.<br /><br />The meticulous 3D adaptation created from the original digital artwork features razor sharp high definition, glorious colors, and takes Walt Disney's multiplane camera concept soaring to new heights!<br /><br />The phenomenal visuals are matched by rich story and characters, and the now-classic music by Elton John and Hans Zimmer.<br /><br />Hard to believe this contemporary classic could be improved upon, but it has been, and beautifully so!<br /><br />This is a film-lover's fantasy come true, dazzling to the eyes and the ears, and a film we will watch over and over again.<br /><br />My very highest, most enthusiastic recommendation!!!<br /><br />Don't hesitate for a moment - ORDER IT NOW!

0307352145|5.0|Susan Cain's research into this topic is extensive - and her report of it is incredibly balanced. What she details is a fascinating perspective on personality that should be read and embraced by anyone in education, but especially those in K-8 classrooms. As an introvert myself, I've long been aware of many of the nuances she uncovers - however, her work was still incredibly eye-opening, especially in the large scale perspectives it presents.<br /><br />Also, this book is a great read for extroverts, and can't help but improve everyone's understanding and ability to create richer, more appreciative relationships. Read it!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|More addicting than the first book, this one keeps you wanting more...and more..and more... Can't get enough of Fifty Shades!
B00005JN8Z|5.0|One of the best Over The Top Scenery eating performances ever!  He owned every scene he was in. I could cut out all his scenes and put them on DVD and have a fine time.  The rest of the movie requires a bit of slogging through.  It's wooden and did Romans really talk like that?  The Rapturous type scenes are so over-done as to be almost laughable.  I just keep reminding myself of when this was made.  In fact, I saw this film when it was new. (egad)
B0052U59F4|5.0|Once of the most addicting books I have ever read!  I am normally not a huge book reader, but someone suggested it to me.  I could not put it down.  I read the whole series in about a month.
B000002MUQ|5.0|Ever since Sammy Hager joined the VH, the album works got heavier and heavier as time goes by particularly after [[ASIN:B000002LEM Ou812]]. [[ASIN:B000002LPD For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge]] tested its heaviness to the limit and the following album released in 1995 consequently took the balance of soft and heavy material pretty well making the finished work one of the finest Sammy-era Van Halen efforts. The reason because the album became excellent may be that the production and sound direction perfectly fit Sammy's voice range.<br /><br />CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU and NOT ENOUGH are impressive hit tracks from the album but the true appeal of this album comes from heavier tracks such as AMSTERDAM and BALUCHITERIUM an excellent instrumental track. BIG FAT MONEY is also a nice rock track and I am curious about how Dave will perform this on live. The album is impeccable. Giving best out of Sammy's vocal appeal and the band's potential for heavy metal band.<br /><br />Unfortunately the year 1995 was the bad year to get their work to be highly appreciated. Had this been out three years earlier and the situation might have been different.<br /><br />I just got their new material [[ASIN:B0071T5PN0 A Different Kind Of Truth]] recently and I hope their 2012 release to be added as another VH masterpiece. Well, let's find it out.<br /><br />Verdict: Excellent mid 90s hard rock work.<br />Rating: 92 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Every Van Halen fans. Hard rock and 80s rock fans.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Although the repetitve words, phrases & sex scenes are a bit annoying, I loved this book & couldn't put it down. It was so great watching Christian transform into a different person. Again, the ending is a cliffhanger & I can't wait to start reading the 3rd book.
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone that likes sci-fi.  Great acting and special effects. It was cool that they fit all that plot into one episode. I cant wait to check out the rest.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|After playing with the SteadyVid PRO for over a month I'm happy to say that it was an excellent investment for the shoots I've taken it on.  I will admit I've never used the Steadycam Merlin, but from everything I've read online they are extremely similar in almost every way except price.  I even used Steadycam Merlin training materials and manuals to get better acquainted with the Opteka SteadyVid Pro.  Lets get right down to it:<br /><br />PROS:<br />+  WAY cheaper than the Steadycam Merlin<br />+  Functionality was exactly what I expected for a steadycam<br />+  I've already tossed it around and dropped it several times with no issues, build quality seems great<br /><br />CONS:<br />-  Lack of a manual or training guide.  As other have mentioned, if you took this straight out of the box without doing any research before hand, you would probably end up tossing it out a window in frustration.  There is a very basic quick-start page included, but not really enough to really get you going.  Luckily there are plenty of resources on the internet to assist, including many of the basics right out of the Steadycam Merlin manual which is available online, so this isn't that big a deal.<br /><br />Things to consider:<br />o  It took me several hours of tweaking and playing around with it before I found a good balance with my camera (T2i, Tokina 11-16mm).  The adjustments are VERY minute, so you'll need to be patient.<br />o  After holding it up for long periods of time your arm will start to get fatigued, so don't expect to use it without breaks for long shoots or for longer times at awkward angles.<br />o  Take a look at steadycam footage and be sure to research what they are capable of before purchasing.  No handheld steadycam will be dolly or track replacement or immediately work miracles out of the box.  The more you practice with it the better shots you will be able to produce.  The Opteka SteadyVid Pro is most impressive in very fast moving shots that would otherwisebe impossible without it (such as running/chasing scenes, the SteadyVid Pro remains eerily steady as your feet pound the pavement).  I've also taken great footage shooting inside of a moving car interior with the Steady Vid Pro.  I haven't had the best luck with more subtle camera movements due to how sensitive everything is, but again this is more of a limitation of steadycams in general----don't expect to throw away your dolly after purchasing this.<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br />The Opteka Steadyvid Pro is a great tool that will do exactly what it was made to do---make sure you research what these handheld steadycams are capable of before purchasing, and be prepared to test your patience with a lot of trial and error as you learn how to balance your camera.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've used the Smith's Pocket Pal for a couple years now, and it is an incredibly worthwhile device. I keep mine within arms reach almost all the time! If you're someone who can't abide a dull blade, this is a tool you'll enjoy.<br /><br />It won't put a razor edge on a knife, and you shouldn't try to use it to repair major nicks and dings in the blade, but when it comes to simple blade maintenance, the Pocket Pal delivers. Use the carbide blades to reset the edge of the knife, use the ceramic blades to hone it, and use the sharpening rod for minor repair of small dings in knife blades and sharpening up serrated knife edges.<br /><br />It's incredibly handy for sharpening your everyday carry knife without hauling out the diamond rods and whet stones. Ever checked out a friend or relative's knife blade and noticed it was duller than all get out? Fix it for them on the spot! I use mine almost every day. It's a great value and a very useful item for anybody who's even a little \\"knife-centric\\".

B006VRENW2|5.0|I very much appreciate the delivery and ease of being able to watch just what I like when I wish to watch it. The definition and ratio was perfect for the Kindle Fire.<br />Really an excellent show.
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|I receive this film and had to return it because it would not work on my t.V.  The return process was excellent and I received another copy right away.  This copy had some of the same problems as the other copy but I chose not to return it,  and was able to watch it on an old t.v. set.  Movie was good disappointed with product.
B004A8ZWVK|2.0|Look, I haven't read the book nor plan to but this movie is something Hollywood pats their backs about. \\"Oh, look, we've made a movie from a bestselling book about an injustice...that happened now 50 years ago! Let's navelgaze at how bad our past was and congratulate ourselves for not employing illegal aliens as maids now...oops, OK, well, we treat our maids well and pay them union wages...Oh, we don't...Oh, never mind, just watch this movie then.\\" I guess that means the movie about Latino or Filipina maids abused and bullied across the globe will come out in 2062.<br /><br />Anyway, I found the actual movie ponderously slow. It takes a full hour and a half of buildup to get interesting. Why so much back story? We get it. Pick up the pace!<br /><br />The acting is overall good bar Dallas Bryce Howard who can't act her way out of a paper bag. The token bone of a love \\"story\\" for Emma Stone was unnecessary and seemed completely irrelevant. There is a distinctive lack of males in this chick flick overall and even the abusive husband of one of the maids we never even see. Not that the one scene is not effective but it was like they wanted to show an African-American world where men only existed offscreen. In fact the major references were news stories of the time shown in a magazine article on Medger Evers and the TV broadcast of the Emmett Till murder. (Those of you unaware, Wiki both names and learn something of the Civil Rights Movement from something other than movies).<br /><br />The story would have been better served by tighter editing, axing at least 30 minutes off the long drawn-out snoozefest start and having way way more of Ocatvia Spencer's character onscreen.<br /><br />The extras are shameful. All we get is deleted scenes. Come on! This DVD was a perfect opportunity to have an actual mini-documentary on what life was really like for these maids in Mississippi in the '60s. After all, the movie is really supposedly a life lesson on the evils of racism.

B0058UXHHK|3.0|I was intrigued by the reviews I read and decided to try the book.  I was looking for a quick easy romance mystery and this book fit that perfectly.<br />The main character Rose Ann Gardner, is eccentric and 'has visions' but it is not a paranormal book per se.  The visions add to part of the story and how she becomes involved in the mystery in the book.  The author had some interesting story lines and the main idea of the book left a good message of enjoying life. As light as her character is, her mother is abusive and a very dislikable person, making the book feel a little more real than most romance books.<br />My reason for three stars and not four (I would have given it 3.5 stars) was it was too predictable, both in the mystery and the romance.<br />I would recommend this author and hope to see many more of the main characters.

0345803485|4.0|I must admit that Fifty Shades of Grey is my new guilty pleasure! I was curious to read the book having read so many rave reviews on Amazon and I am happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.<br />The love story between the main characters, Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, kept me hooked from the start. The author perfectly portrayed all the angst and heartache of first love. She transported me back to those heady days with my first boyfriend and the intoxicating feelings that we were the only people in the world who ever felt so in love.<br />The book was very explicit and somewhat repetitive in parts and I found Ana's sexual prowess a little unrealistic at times, especially considering that Christian was her first lover.<br />The dialogue was witty and made me smile at times. I enjoyed the emails between Ana and Christian as this is where their true personality and thoughts seemed to shine. The plot was mostly centered around the developing love between Ana and Christian.<br />Some hints were dropped throughout the book that Christian had experienced a horrifying early childhood, which intrigued me. I liked Ana but I found her character to be fairly one dimensional. She was likeable but predictable. However, Christian was fascinating and he is the main reason that I am very much looking forward to reading Fifty Shades Darker, the second book in the trilogy.

1451627289|5.0|Horror is a monster.  But I used to think of them as foreign things, beyond human understanding, coming to kill, consume, or destroy indiscriminately, overturning an at least tolerable, if not happy, way of life.<br /><br />11/22/63 and Mr. King have taught me better than that.<br /><br />Horror is a monster.  Unfortunately, the best ones--or worst ones, depending on your point of view--are people.  And not just people, but people we know--love even, which is where the most horrific part comes in to play.<br /><br />Oswald is a minor part of 11/22/63, in fact, he's a bit player, a backdrop.  Without checking, I guess he probably appears on twenty pages or fewer of the 849 page novel.  Jake Epping or George Zimmerman, depending on which side of the timeline your seat is, has Oswald firmly in mind when he crosses through fifty years to 1958 on a mission to save the 35th President of the United States.  So how does King fill a nearly 1,000 page beast of a read when the hero's only goal is to kill a character who's barely even in it?<br /><br />Monsters.<br /><br />No, not the kind that come from space or travel through time (although time travel, obviously, is a huge plot device).  They don't even bother dragging themselves out of dark, cavernous basements or creak down long unending hallways.  The monsters are right there in the open to be read in broad daylight.  From the would-be family murdering Frank Dunning, the Cuban bookie Jake meets in Florida, or John Clayton, the monsters either don't, or barely hide.  Including the biggest monster of all; Epping himself.<br /><br />Oh no, you won't get it out of me how the man--and his predecessor, Al Templeton--is the worst of all these monsters, but I think they all have a single motivation: selfishness.  Something has been taken from each of these men and they would have it or an item of equal value back.  Money, reputation, respect, life.  Yes, when you find out how exactly the rabbit hole works, you'll understand more.  You'll understand why the Yellow Card Man is probably one of the saddest heroes in modern-day literature (maybe that's an over-exaggeration; I won't qualify it, though).  You'll understand why every paragraph you read detailing what Jake Epping does in the mid-twentieth century is wrong.<br /><br />But 11/22/63 should remind a sane and reasonable person how selfish human beings naturally are.  How we want what we want regardless of consequences, how so like infants we continue to be even into adulthood.  And how it takes near supernatural forces sometimes to sway us from our lone paths.  It is a lonely path for Epping.  It takes five years and two minutes at the same time and he passes by paradoxes and steps over quandaries in single pursuit of a selfish goal that he is constantly nudged away from from the moment he steps out of 2011 and into 1958.<br /><br />Oswald is only the monster you expect; he is not the only one you see.  Killing him seems the noble, reasonable thing to do if anyone were given a time machine to go back and do it.

0553801473|2.0|I just finished Dance of Dragons not 30 minutes ago.<br />The fact that it took me more then two months from<br />the time I turned the first page to the time I set<br />it aside for the last time should tell the reader<br />of this review everything they need to know regarding<br />my feelings for this book and for the direction (or<br />lack of) that the series has taken.<br /><br />In comparison, I finished the first 3 books of the<br />series in 2 or 3 days each, reading until my eyes<br />blurred from fatigue and then pushing through another<br />4 or 5 chapters. Even book 4, which in final analysis was<br />beyond disappointing, was polished off in less then 2 weeks<br />but that was based on the hope that each upcoming<br />chapter might see the return of the masterful story<br />telling found in the first 3 volumes. No such luck.<br /><br />I've been trying to explain to my brother, who introduced<br />me to the series years ago but has refused to read<br />books 4 and 5 based largely on my feedback, exactly<br />what has gone wrong with Martin's story. I won't pretend<br />that I can come close to articulating the problems with<br />books 4 and 5 as well as some of the other reviews I've<br />read here. Truly, some of the reviews had me in tears<br />of laughter as the story faults were eloquently and humorously<br />satirized without mercy. However, I wanted to add my<br />own thoughts, though admittedly brief and lacking in<br />any grand prose.<br /><br />Simply put...Martin's grand story has truly become a<br />caricature of itself. I've always contested that many<br />a series has started out strong and promising only to<br />falter under the weight of wandering story lines and<br />their authors own inability to bring home a focused<br />and meaningful conclusion.<br /><br />It is as if the authors fall in love with the world's<br />they've created and can't possibly understand why the<br />reader has no interest in 'watching' their characters<br />simply exist in meaningless story lines. This, I believe,<br />is exactly what has happened to Martin and his story. He<br />has no idea how to formulate a conclusion that would do<br />justice to his First Act. It is as if he believes that<br />a plethora of new characters and story lines is necessary<br />to provide the 'epic' nature of his series.<br /><br />Unfortunately the story has ground to a halt. There are<br />precious few times when the end of one chapter's POV<br />causes any kind of excitement for the next chapter of<br />that character. Rather, more often only relief is felt<br />at the end of a chapter and slight hope that the next<br />chapter, with a new POV character will prove somewhat<br />more interesting. I could go on, but honestly I don't<br />want to waste any more of my time on George R. Martin<br />or his story. I doubt, honestly, that I will read the<br />next book.<br /><br />In closing, the producers of the HBO series will have a<br />tough time turning the last two books into anything that<br />resembles the quick moving, enthralling story of the first<br />3 books. Fans everywhere will be disappointed when books 4<br />and 5 are put to screen and the actors themselves will wonder<br />what they heck their happened to their promising characters.<br />Such a shame...so much promise and so little payoff.
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|Was sucked in to see this movie by a decent preview. What a terrible mistake. I am not a UFC fan but I am a fan of strong female characters so I think I can give a less agenda-driven opinion on this movie.<br /><br />The main character could barely act, the famous actors in this film were terrible, the story was not complicated but the director kept flashing back to make it appear more complicated, the fight scenes were totally unrealistic (except for one), the lighting was lousy, minutes spent watching the main character walk through the streets or meander over the roof (????), totally uncreative swipes between scenes.....I could go on but I think I've wasted enough of my life on this piece of junk.<br /><br />Unless you're an unwavering disciple of this director or a cheerleader for this untalented female fighter, your chances of really enjoying this movie are slim to none.
B000059GEI|5.0|Today's audiences do not have history on their side according to the reviews I've read on Amazon.  In order to appreciate quality performance and production spending time to learn the art is necessary.  This is not a flash in the pan production.<br /><br />In this film the actors keep their clothes on. The characters are all the more seductive for it.  They keep their heads out of the toilet. The story line promotes family values. The character's show respect for one another. Yes, it's a education in morals movie that promotes responsibility.<br /><br />This has to be the most extraordinary film of the 1950's.<br /><br />The costuming alone is unbelieveably glamorous, lavish and jaw dropping.<br /><br />I can see why this film would not appeal to modern audiences unless one has a background in the MGM classics.<br /><br />By the way.  The only actress in this film who doesn't fit is MM. I am a great fan of Marilyn.  MM is sensationally cast in \\"Some Like it Hot\\" with Jack Lemon & Tony Curtis and the \\"Seven Year Itch\\", \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blonds\\" to name a few.  But this film...would you have cast Donald O'connor and Mitzy Gaynor with Marilyn?  Donald and Mitzy yes.  Donald and Debby Reyonold fit (in Singing in the Rain).  But in my opinion, Marilyn and Donald here is awkward.<br /><br />Colorful, charming, and musical are adjectives I come up with!  Highly recommended.
B003O86FMW|2.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" was a brilliant novel, very well executed and evocative and beautifully written.  The concept appeals to certain aspects of guilty pleasures plus poses an uncomfortable question: \\"Is this what we're headed toward?\\"  One wonders whether Suzanne Collins plotted out all three installments of the trilogy beforehand or if she wrote \\"The Hunger Games,\\" called it a day, and when the publishers saw its huge success, said \\"Now you've GOT to do a sequel.  Maybe even a TRILOGY!\\"<br /><br />Here's what may have happened, based on the slapdash quality of \\"Catching Fire.\\"  Suzanne Collins may have written a first draft and presented it to the agent/publishing team.  The story may have been about the continuation of Katniss and Peeta's relationship and the uncomfortable triangle posed by Gale, or the beginning could have been the same, with President Snow paying the extremely uncomfortable visit and then four of them flee to the woods.  But no.  The publishing committee said \\"We gotta get Katniss back into the arena again!  We wanna see more blood and guts this time!\\"<br /><br />And Ms. Collins, either motivated by her publishing contract or coerced by the publisher trying to strike the fad fiction iron while it was still hot, gave in.  To give away details of the nature of \\"The 75th Hunger Games\\" would be to court spoilers for those still interested in reading the book.  If this review fails to dissuade you, go ahead and get the book, read it, and see whether you agree that the situations are forced/contrived this time, the characters either stereotypical or cardboard cutout, and the \\"action\\" entirely unplausible.  If you end up saying \\"Good thing I borrowed it instead of bought it,\\" like I did, at least you would have been warned.

0099519852|5.0|I think this is a great book for parents, teachers, coaches, or simply anyone who wants to accomplish something that they've historically considered beyond reach.  It turns out that how you practice and why you practice a sport, music, writing, etc, will determine your ability to excel.  I was fascinated and inspired by (not to mentioned entertained) the stories of \\"talent hotbeds\\" that shed light on why methodology and motivation matter in creating geniuses or even simply people and performances that stand out.    Haven't played piano in 35 years, maybe I'll see if I can re-wire my brain to do so. :)    Thanks for this amazing book. The author has a blog and website with great content. [...]

B004EPYZV2|4.0|Just a quick comment about this particular Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy package. The Product arrived in the mail today, and I was eager to get the digital copy on my iPad. Of all the past Blu-ray + Digital Copy products I purchased, this was an easy process: you either enter the DVD that comes with the product in your DVD Drive and unlock the Digital Copy with the key provided; or you are directed to a Website or iTunes to redeem your digital copy with the code provided. In this case: your are sent on a goose chase to the paramount site to open an account, then to another site to open an account there, then you need to link both accounts, and then you're directed to the download for the movie -- and then, you realize: to download it, you need to install Silverlight (sorry, I'm a Mac user; I shouldn't have to install Silverlight for streaming anything, and I'm not going to). This is utterly misleading, since on the case it states that the Digital Copy is compatible with iTunes. Not sure how that works if I can't get past the requirement to install Silverlight first. I understand Paramount's reasoning behind all this (they want you to sign up for their Ultraviolet cloud service through which they hope you will purchase and stream movies going forward), but I have my accounts already: iTunes and (occasionally) Netflix, and I have no desire to sign up for yet another streaming service/store. Great flick; very disappointed with this product/package; see no reason to purchase these Blu-ray + Digital Copy products in the future if the future means jumping through all these hoops to end up with nothing in the end. If there is just a Blu-ray version (without Digital Copy) for cheaper, I'd rather go with that (or download the HD version from iTunes).

0618001905|3.0|I read this a few years back.  It's interesting, well-written, and tells a good story.  However, the author's estimates of the net death toll and population decline as a result of King Leopold's activities is both improbable and poorly documented.  Anyone with a clear understanding of the methodology of historical research, its pitfalls, and just the way things usually WORK would never make the kind of claims Hothschild makes.  People might want to believe the fantastic estimates he makes -- but they're unjustified.  Hothschild provides no worthwhile basis for his estimate of the Congo's initial population, makes no allowance for the rather obvious possibility that the reaction of the native Congolese to the depredations of the Belgians might have been to simply move away from the navigable rivers, and finally, fails to explain why the Belgians would have been interested in killing so many Congolese.  I'm sure many didn't MIND killing Congolese, and that many, many did die -- but these weren't Hitler's Einsatzgruppen.  They were there to make money, not exterminate the population.  Had anything like the rampage he suggests taken place, the Congolese would have an elaborate mythology relating to it to this day -- which as far as I know, they don't.  No one knows how many did die -- but I'd divide the figures Hothschild suggests by about ten.  The Congo Free State was African colonialism at its worst -- but it wasn't the Holocaust.  Hothschild's figures are pure sensationalism.  It's a pity, as the rest of the book is a fine read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to say I went into this book not knowing what it was about,I know hard to believe!I Started to read this for a book club I am in. I could not put the book down!This may not be everyone's \\"cup of tea\\" but this book was for me, sexy and hot! The start of the book was a little slow, but im so glad after reading it that there was time put into \\"getting to know\\" the characters! I loved it so much, the second I was done reading it I ordered and jumped into the second book, and so far its not disappointing! 5 stars for me!

0307352145|4.0|When I saw the title of this book I was immediately intrigued. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain. Mostly it was the word Quiet. I have been called Quiet many times and I know without a shadow of a doubt that I am an introvert! I loved this book.  In fact, you may not know it but without introverts we wouldn't have the following:<br />the theory of gravity<br /><br />the theory of relativity<br />W.B. Yeats's 'The Second Coming'<br />Chopin's nocturnes<br />Proust's 'In Search of Lost Time'<br />Peter Pan<br />Orwell's '1984' and 'Animal Farm'<br />The Cat in the Hat<br />Charlie Brown<br />'Schindler's List,' 'E.T.,' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'<br />Google<br />Harry Potter<br /><br />This is only a tiny fraction of what introverts have contributed to the world. Being an introvert myself I really enjoyed reading all about this subject. You can tell that Susan Cain (an introvert herself) really did much research in this subject. The book goes on about how our America celebrates the extrovert and social butterflies. Often times it seems if you are not one of these than you are somehow not as good as those who are. Thankfully I already knew that wasn't true. I have been called quiet, shy, timid and I'm sure many other things, but this book goes on to tell how introverts most definitely  have their place in this extroverted world and are needed here as well.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a free copy of Quiet from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for free. I was not required to give a positive review and all opinions are my own.
0439023521|5.0|A beautiful well-written book.  Good writing good characters, good plot. I'm not a young adult, far from it, but I loved the book.  I had already seen the movie so I knew the plot.  Even so, the suspense carried me along and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The book varies from the movie a little.  In the book, Katniss is the hero.  In the movie, they gave Petra more of a chance to be a hero also.  I guess the movie wanted to attract boys to the movie as well as girls.

B006PTZNSY|1.0|Take a short vacation Nicki, you'll be okaaaaaaaay.  And to be frank, we need a break too.  \\"Roman Holiday\\" is the only decent track in this pile of steaming, synthesised bilge, and it's a shame Roman doesn't get out more - this track is a standout, something you'd hear in a Ken Russell film if hip-hop had been around in his day.  Other than that it's 12 year old bedroom producer going Gaga.  Awful rubbish.
B004FJJGBG|5.0|If you have a Blu-ray player or a 3D Blu-ray player then this is a must have. Avatar is by far the best looking Blu-ray and the 3D is the best there is.

I paid £40 for mine on eBay and it was well worth it in my opinion.
B0060ZJ7BC|2.0|this film makes poor use of it's source material and is more focussed on portraying billy as emotional and egotistical than showing the work he actually did with stats. even without comparisons to the more cohesive faster paced book the generic \\"good dad\\" scenes are as cliched as they are irrelevant, and the scenes when players are being traded don't explain why he wants whichever players he wants, just a series of meaningless names said back and forth and then a victory cheer, and we're supposed to cheer with him like we know what was achieved? the director might as well have just made up some more fanciful fictional explanation for how billy found new players and made the fantasy baseball movie he really wanted to make where emotional outbursts and cocky one-liners are the more relevant hallmarks that define winners. the actual stock footage of the fan-made signs in the stands spanning the A's record breaking 20 win streak packed more punch than any of the fictional bluster. given the critical and popular reception though i can't argue with results. the director did give people what they wanted.
B0062KMDZ2|3.0|Firstly the good points, it was very quickly delivered by our postman, who i must admit, i didnt know worked for Amazon, so that was a pleasant surprise, is secret is safe with me, as we all need to make any extra cash any we we can. The packaging is very nice and is about the right size for a DVD. I have also found that CD's fit nicely into the box.<br />The film itself is not actually a documentary about travelling to the center of the earth however. I was expecting a David Attenborough type in depth programme with all kinds of weird and wonderful creatures. I was also dissapointed that the film is old style 3D not compatable with modern 3D tvs, but after a few attempts of squinting, or closing 1 eye and even blinking rapidly all failed i discovered that if you stand as far away from the television as possible and then run towards it, its like things are flying out from the TV at you.<br />The story itself is ok, but ive had more adventure, and been more frightened, on the journey to the garden center, especially when its 25% off weekends for the over 60's. Would i buy this again? Yes i would, but then i would have 2 copies, which would be very silly, and i'd rather spend the money on some Fruit Pastilles.

0312427999|4.0|Naomi's Klein's The Shock Doctrine is a book whose strength lies in its explanation and case studies of \\"disaster capitalism\\", crony corporatism, and \\"disaster apartheid.\\" What is disaster capitalism? After having finished the book, my definition is: using disasters and other crises as opportunities and excuses to take away land and other resources and transfer it into the hands of powerful, favored corporations. The rich take advantage of the disadvantaged to become richer. Similarly, disaster apartheid divides society into two classes: the \\"have\\"s who can afford basic security, disaster services, and the unfortunate \\"have not\\"s who cannot afford these basic services.<br /><br />The author gives plenty of examples of disaster capitalism in action, starting with Milton Friedman, ranging from Chile to Iraq, and from New Orleans to Israel. Cheney's companies Halliburton and Bechtel made billions in uncontested contracts when Cheney was VP. Rumsfeld's Gilead Sciences likewise making a killing out of the Bird Flu (Tamiflu) at the same time. Both men retaining their corporate ties not just before and after but during their tenures in office. Xe Systems, LLC, formerly known as Blackwater - has raised up armies of mercenaries while other groups likewise develop their own shadow armies not associated with the state.<br /><br />The growing reality we will be facing is that the \\"can't do\\" state of government has and will continue to farm out services out to a parallel corporate state which the state then rents back to the people. The result is that the people will become more and more deprived of basic governmental rights. The corporations will make disaster services, security, safe drinking water, chartered schools, etc.  available to the public, renting to whoever can afford them at whatever price the market can bear. For people on the inside, it will be like living in Iraq's Green Zone. But for those excluded who cannot afford basic services formerly supplied by the government, it is already and will become more and more like living in Iraq's Red Zone.<br /><br />The author's brief conclusion is that there is still hope: we can resist the cultural bulldozer known as reconstruction wherever it might next rear its ugly head. However, what I read through the last few chapters came across as anything but hopeful. The favored have already put their plans in place and are ready to be whisked away to any of their number of protected \\"green zones\\" when need arises, while the middle class will in the future seek to put together their own protected communities, leaving the poor and disadvantaged to suffer. As a Christian, I can only wonder if from an eschatological perspective if the ancient beast of Revelation has reared its ugly head.<br /><br />In order to balance what I read in this book with a second or third perspective, I want to pick up another title or two on neoliberalism and neo-conservatism. Anyone have some good recommendations?ment, it is already and will become more and more like living in Iraq's Red Zone.<br /><br />The author's brief conclusion is that there is still hope: we can resist the cultural bulldozer known as reconstruction wherever it might next rear its ugly head.

0385344228|4.0|I found the book to be interesting, well written, a little too wordy but an overall good story. A few things puzzled me.  Why did Andy refuse to see or admit that anything was amiss with Jacob?  Why did Laurie seem to keep her misgivings to herself and mostly why, after receiving the report from the psychiatrist nothing was done to assist Jacob?  It didn't matter what the verdict was, they were told of his issues and yet they seemed willing to put it aside entirely.  I thought that was a bit strange and self defeating.

0399159029|4.0|\\"Prague Fatale\\" by Phillip Kerr follows Berlin detective Bernie Gunther as he is assigned to protect Reinhard Heydrich, the Reichsprotector of Czechoslovakia. It is World War 2, 1941 and Germany is still doing rather well in the war, though cracks are beginning to show. But Gunther has his own problems to worry about. Back in Berlin, a foreign worker has been run over by a train, only Gunther sees that he was actually murdered. Shortly afterwards, he meets Arianne, a bar girl who got in trouble after she agreed to pass an envelope from a mysterious gentleman called Gustav, to another mysterious gentleman, without knowing what's inside.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Gunther gets transferred to Czechoslovakia to protect his boss Heydrich, and takes Arianne along. Only, instead of Heydrich, one of Heydrich's adjutants by the name of Kuttner is the one to get murdered--and in a locked room, with a locked window no less.<br /><br />To add complexity to the plot, one of the German high-ranking officials sharing the house with Heydrich and Gunther is suspected of being a traitor and passing secret intelligence information to the Czech resistance. The question is, whom?<br /><br />Although Philip Kerr has written a series about the adventures of Bernie Gunther, this is the first book in the series that I've read. It's an interesting mix of historical fiction--based on real people and researched events of the times covered--and mystery/spy thriller.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I did love this game, but about every other time I played,  all of the timers on the items I'm supposed to click on reset, to a ridiculous number like 64 or 72 hours before I can collect food or money again. there's nothing I can do in the game right now unless I sell everything and start over, but even that would be a waste because the timers will just reset again and I'll have to buy and sell all over again.
0765309408|5.0|I read this book a couple of years ago and it was good enough to remember and then seek out the sequel \\"The Ghost Brigades\\", which I've recently finished.<br /><br />Its fast paced, presents new and imaginative ideas with a storyline that is easy to follow and yet engaging. Writing style is also just right - not suffering from the need to impress the reader with crazy vocabulary that nobody really uses.<br /><br />Loved it and looking forward to reading the rest. Would make a terrific film!
0345803485|2.0|This book has its moments of witty dialogue and it is a bit of a page-turner.  But it reads as though it was written by a sixteen-year-old rather than a woman in her forties.  The writing is painfully sophomoric and laboured.  The heroine is ridiculous, the hero a petulant bully, and the story, such as it is, swings back and forth between silly, melodramatic and just plain unbelievable.  I guess it's heartwarming that she cures him of the worst of his problems (in about three months!) but it's just so, so silly.  The push-pull between Ana's \\"Inner Goddess\\" and \\"Subconscious\\" was so annoying I can hardly describe it.  An infantile angel vs devil-on-my-shoulder device that should never have been allowed past the editor's desk.<br /><br />To enjoy the book you need to suspend your disbelief, lower your literary standards, and just hope you find the (creepy) sex scenes enjoyable.
B0073Q0DZG|2.0|When you think about combing the acting and comedic talents of Steve Martin, Jack Black, Owen Wilson, Angelic Houston and a few others, you would probably expect the outcome of that movie would result in pure gold. So how is that when combining all these stars, it fails to be memorable comedy?<br /><br />A big year is explained as being someone who dedicates a whole year of their life hunting, chasing, and photographing birds. The past winner was played by Owen Wilson who saw 728 birds, which is the current record. Steve Martin plays a businessman who is about to retire and wants to have a big year, and Jack Black is someone who hates his job and his passion is achieving a new record. Jack and Steve meet along the way on their Big Year, and Owen Wilson's character is defending his title and trying to stop them from breaking his record. Along the way they discover love, and what really matters more then bird watching.<br /><br />Sound interesting to you? Then watch it. Sound dull? Then don't bother, you aren't missing much. The plot is as boring to explain as what most of this movie was to watch. There is very little comedy. Now and then Steve Martin will make you chuckle, but not enough for me to even say this is a light-hearted comedy. It's more a light-hearted drama with a few tiny humorous spots thrown in here and there.<br /><br />I don't get this movie tho, it was meant to be a comedy, but had none, it's based on a true story, supposedly, but left me thinking, why would anyone bother to do this? And the acting talent I really expected something better from. Either a funnier movie, or something better in the acting department that says \\"OK, you did this to showcase your talents\\" but no, that's not it either.<br /><br />I find it puzzling how this all came together in the first place, and why? Maybe it's just not my cup of tea, I dunno, but I can't wrap my head around why it was even made?

0385342039|5.0|What a great read! I wasn't very excited to read this book because I saw in the description that there was a ghost involved. I am not into paranormal books, so I put this one off for a while. Eventually I decided that I should give it a chance because I've enjoyed all of Kinsella's other books. I'm so happy I decided to read this!<br /><br />Lara is a character you can't help but love. She's struggling to make it in a field she knows next to nothing about. She is putting on a great show for everyone that her business is succeeding and life is great. Meanwhile her boyfriend broke up with her, her business partner deserted her and she's seeing a ghost. Not just any ghost, the ghost of her 105 year old great-aunt who just passed away. The ghost comes back as a 23 year old that has a saucy, spicy attitude that Lara doesn't know what to do about. The ghost, Sadie, is spicing up Lara's life: making her ask out someone she's never met, go buy clothes from vintage shops, and cause a big family uproar. There are no limits to what the two of them can accomplish together... and what kind of trouble they can get into.<br /><br />I don't think a book has ever had me laughing this hard. Kinsella describes everything with such extraordinary detail, I felt like I was there with Lara. I wish there were a sequel to this book! It also made me think about all my elderly family members. Every one of them was young once and probably feels like Sadie did, like they are a young person trapped in an old person's body. After reading this book I have made a resolution to spend some time asking them about their life experiences. Anyway, I would love to see this as a movie someday.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would recommend this to everybody. If you are looking at this app download it. You will not regret it.
0307712508|5.0|I was so glad to have read this! I had to read for assigment for college, but what a amazing story. They shoudl teach this in school!
0345803485|3.0|This might be my American language barrier coming out, since there are so many distinct differences, but honestly, it's set in WA state, where I happen to live.<br /><br />That being said... I love the story itself, so far. I'm a little over halfway through and have a couple of complaints, but still plan to finish it, which is good.<br /><br />I don't read romance, but the BDSM thing caught me off guard and made it a little more to my \\"horror\\" taste. Dark and twisted romance... not too shabby. Good idea.<br /><br />Problem 1: this book is way overpriced for an eBook. Since so many copies have sold, it should be less expensive because readers should want to check it out without feeling like they have to overspend to read something, especially where the quality standards of conversion, spelling, grammar, and typos isn't up to par with professional publishing standards.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong... I can understand the occasional mistake or typo, but when you have them in every chapter, that is unacceptable, especially when you can AFFORD to hire a professional editor. (Hell, we aren't even that expensive if you know where to look.)<br /><br />The point is, the book has the potential to be fantastic in every way... even though it's a bestseller, it isn't great. It's unprofessional and mediocre at points, so I really don't see myself overspending on more eBooks by this author without at least having an editor involved.<br /><br />It does have its entertaining moments... but I personally feel that there should've been a lot more revision and editing, from a professional/business standpoint.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jennifer-Crystal Johnson<br />Author of If You're Human Don't Open the Door<br />and Strangers with Familiar Faces
B0074EIQQU|5.0|This album is really good.Experimental,psychedelic and haunting at times.Yes there is 2 tracks that stink but all the others are really good especially \\"Zen & Two Naughts\\" and the opening track.This album wasn't disappointing at all and is another masterpiece in their work.
0545265355|1.0|This item (books) was ordered 20 days ago and has not yet shipped!  I have purchased many items from Amazon and have always received great service.  The shipping on this order is wildly out of line and is unacceptable.
145162445X|4.0|I was impressed by the book and some of the concepts it covered. Definition of \\"Nothing\\" was interesting.The bit about the Universe being \\"flat\\" was also challenging to the mind in a positive way(it was not clear if this is in 4 dimensional space-time or after considering other dimensions!!). A good popular science effort in bringing as yet unresolved scientific issues to the attention of the general public.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This app is amazing!! I am a huge music person and found this absolutely awesome. Very addicting too. I totally recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome! This by far, the best Bible apple ever. Nothing else compares. If you are looking for the best, you've found it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I have Super Mario bros. and have to say this is a simplified version of it. Get it while it is free. Please get this.
0307592731|1.0|I was looking forward to hearing about the trail and nature.  Not about her incredibly poor decisions, her pathetic sexual episodes and drug use.  This lady has some serious issues and needs help.  I would give the book a zero rating if I could.  What a waste.
0671015206|4.0|I loved this book. It debunks all of the stereotypes of the wealthy class, limo riding, cigar smoking, elites dining out in their finest, versus the real wealth of ordinary stiffs dining at home wearing their \\"finest\\"--work clothes. Voltaire would love this book too and find evidence for his quote: \\"Common sense is not so common.\\"
B004EBT5CU|5.0|A beautiful CD of Adele's. Easy to listen to with powerful beats, strong lyrics, and absolutely beautiful, haunting voice at times. It was given me as a gift and I love it!
B0061S0A64|5.0|This application is fantastic, I cannot express how great it is. Make music, save it, share it.<br /><br />In a word?<br /><br />WONDERFUL!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|101 in 1 games is kinda cool but it is not awesome ,one they are not free you have to earn points I would rather just have them,two why not just name it 124 games,and three they should tell you what the  little games are about cuz you might get desoponied when you get them
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Always great Michael, this is and always will be a classic, however there is a nice twist with interesting information about him. his music and career added to this.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|the only thing I don't care for is that you get sucked into wanting to spend more and more money.
0857680986|5.0|i didn't buy it but i do have an art teacher who just adores my drive to be a pro and he had about 6 PDF. files(adobe reader) all by andrew loomis and this one especially has helped me so much i recommend it to anyone looking to learn figure drawing, anatomy, proportions, etc its got tons of stuff
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a fun game. I wish you could exchange coins for acorns. Great for free though! I wouldn't pay for it or buy acorns.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very easy to play  and the kids really enjoys this game!  very colorful and funny characters  even the adults likes to play this game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finish all three of this series and LOVE them all.  Great for those who enjoy action and those who enjoy the love stories.
B0055SWM08|3.0|It's a great game and all, but it should save your place better. this one seemingly looses your place at random, forcing you to start almost from the start, and loose your stats too.
B005K17RU0|5.0|its a very nice app. love the radar and the extended forecast view. its easy to use and installed like a charm.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it the game is so so so cute. Everyone should at least give it a try endless hours of easy stress free fun
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game. Graphics are fantastic.  Except for a problem with being able to play with and visit friends., its really fun.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|I enjoy Ryan Gosling, so my review has nothing to do with the acting...It's just that this film really does suck. It's weird from beginning to end. I think if you like all those 'indie' type films, you'll likely like this one. But, for me, NOPE. However, the music was awesome...I even bought a couple of the songs.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a very very very  very very very very good game hee hee and um ya so by by by by by  by by
B007R41E8O|5.0|I<br />I'm completely addicted. I know I spend way too much time playing this game. But I love it. Graphics are great-visuals are fantanstic and sound effects are awesome. What more to say!
B007R41E8O|5.0|I just started playing and already its pretty scary. I love the mix of puzzles too.  The length also is appreciated :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is addictive. I cant wait to get home and play in the evenings!<br />my kids love it too! they like to fish and hunt in the game
0345803493|5.0|I AM SOOOOO BEYOND OBSESSED with these books it has taken over my life that I do not know what to read next !!! I recommend this book x100000000
0439023521|5.0|The book was amazing.  When you start reading it you do not want to stop. The Hunger Games are one of the best book I have read.
B00005B1W7|5.0|I REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE A LOT. I AM INTO HISTORICAL MOVIES VERY MUCH. I WISH OTHER PEOPLE TO SEE THIS MOVIE SO THEY WON'T DENY THE EXISTANCE OF THE HOLOCAUST.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire, the second installment of the Hunger Games trilogy, sees heroine Katniss Everdeen clashing with the Capitol once again.  Living in Victor's Village should be an opportunity for the Girl on Fire and her family to finally relax and enjoy some of life's comforts, but we find out right away that life is seldom easy, especially when the iron grip of the Capitol is involved.  Through some creative game dynamics we soon learn Peeta and Katniss must enter the arena once more, along with previous victors representing all of the other districts.  Suzanne Collins takes us right back to the belly of the beast, creating an arena filled with dangers and trials even more harrowing than described in The Hunger Games, the first in the series.  From the first chapter, right through to the end, I couldn't put this book down, not just because it's action packed and filled with twists, I love watching Katniss grow as a complex character you can't help but cheer for.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great kids game. fun to play. my 3 year old and mh nephew who are both 3 love it as well!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I'm a cheap person when it comes to games for my kindle fire. I usually get the free games, and at best they're ......meh. This game blew my mind! The story is great, the graphics are good for such a small device (equivalent to PS2), and the culture is absorbing (bought the OST just to hear the opening song, lingua de tulmaldua). It plays exactly like GTA (I was even looking for a rockstar games emblem in the creds lol). I wouldn't say it's a ripoff of GTA though, it has its uniqueness. For starters, the controls are awesome, and easier to drive than gta, I'm not crashing as much! The targeting is good too. I do have some suggestions, when walking, I think the developer needs to find a way to instantly look behind yourself (rear view); I had been walking around, and started getting shot from behind, it takes too much time to pan the screen over to the person shooting at you (but when ur pro like me its not that big of a problem, hence my 5 star rating). I'm sold, whatever gameloft's sellin', I'm buyin'!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's a wonderful Bible and the best part of it is that it is for free. Some of the versions though are not available.
0307352145|5.0|Quiet, by Susan Cain, is subtitled \\"The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.\\"  Cain has written a well-researched tome on why some of us are introverted, the varying degrees of introversion, and why having introverts on your team can be a very positive thing.  If you are an introvert, or if you have introverts in your family or working for you, then you should make this the next book you read.<br /><br />Cain makes several strong points.  First, she points out that education in general and business schools in particular are geared to turning out extroverts.  Picture the stereotypical salesman or CEO; most people immediately think of a glad-handing extrovert.<br /><br />Another point is that introverts typically think things through thoroughly before making a decision.  If Enron or WorldCom had introverts at the highest level; and if these introverts would have spoken up and offered their advice, perhaps these companies' executives would not have committed criminal acts and still would be viable today.<br />Cain cites many studies on introversion and leadership.  Her research is thorough; the footnotes alone take up 47 pages.  Her conclusions are insightful and sound.  I learned things about myself and my daughter, both introverts, that I had not thought about before.<br /><br />If there is one drawback to Cain's excellent book, it is that many extroverts will not take the time to read through it.  Perhaps there should be a Spark Notes edition for them.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group Blogging for Books program for this review.
B000OVLINI|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind is one of the best books I've ever read.  It reminds you of some historical events and introduces you to the marvelous city of Barcelona.  Eventhough it is a translation, it's a very good one that allows you to introduce yourself in the novel and live it.
B001B9G5K8|5.0|Use to listen to this back in the day, glad I get to drive to it once again. Love this album.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The title says it all. This game is enjoyable, with simple rules, quick puzzles, and challenges for the completionist. It also doesn't hurt that it was the free app of the day.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|5 stars bag it app get it now.  this is a great app that is addictingly fun.  get this app now.
0131480057|5.0|I have had this book for about 3 weeks and it has already bailed me out 3 or 4 times. It's well written, easy to read and very informative. I have a small network but that doesn't make the admin headaches go away. This is Tylenol of System Administrators. If you have to do admin work, even on small installation, buy it. Security has always been a headache for me. This book is a great help here.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect at first but I was hooked from the start. Fun game. Husband and son are hooked to. Gameloft has done it again. Great game!
B005PMNBPY|4.0|Always been a fan of this band, and this is more great music.  I probably wouldn't put it up there with their more ground-breaking work of the past, but definitely a strong effort from an important group of musicians.  It's on my regular playlist.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I have just finished the hunger games trilogy. The review title indicates that my enjoyment went down as I went from Book 1 to Book 3. The only reason I finished Mockingjay was to get some closure, but it was a battle. The first book was enjoyable, but I felt that book 3 was rushed by the author and I didn't really li,ke the ending. No spoiler alert, I just didn't like it.
B000002VSN|5.0|This cd is great. I am glad I bought it. It broght back a lot of memories. I would recommend this cd.
1848366159|4.0|This book is an excellent book for me when in Japan and is very up to date.  It is much more thorough than free websites.  I think the coverage outside of Tokyo and Kyoto is generally strong, and you will probably find something to do in the book no matter where you are.<br /><br />The maps in this book are very helpful, especially on-the-ground when walking around.  I have been lost several times and consulted the book to find my way in certain neighborhoods.  I also use the maps to find things nearby.<br /><br />While the book is good at locating important places, no book can tell you how to get from where you are to that place.  If you are planning a trip just to Tokyo or across Japan, using train websites like hyperdia.com will be a good aid in planning your trip along with this book.
0439023491|5.0|Amazing story, strong characters, plausible plot. American dystopia and revolution. My kids loved it and got me hooked as well.
1609611543|5.0|I kind of stumbled upon this book by accident. I was surfing the `net and saw what looked like an infomercial-like banner about losing weight by giving up wheat. I read it. It seemed pretty cheesy. But it kind of made sense. So I ordered the book. It had some answers I have been looking for. Let me explain.<br /><br />In the last 10 years I've had four tumors. Three of them were in the same place. My left arm just above the  left elbow. The first one I had got so bad that it started bulging out of the bone. The doctor had to cut into the bone, clean it out, put in a bone graft and sew me back up. Once in 2002, the second time in 2009, and the third time on March the 9th, 2012. I think of myself as a fairly healthy guy. I'm 57 years old, don't drink, smoke or chew. I pretty much gave up sweets and pop quite a while ago. A few years ago with a lot of effort I got down to 183 pounds. Pretty much my ideal weight in my mind. I'm 6'1\\" tall. But I put the pounds back on gradually and the day of my third surgery I weighed in at 212 pounds.<br /><br />This surgery was different though. I didn't recover like I normally did. I was kept in the hospital overnight because I got so sick. They let me go the next day but I didn't get any better. My wife talked to the doctors and I was re-admitted. After sizing up the situation the doctors had me get an MRI. On my head. They found out I had a tumor that was pushing on my pituitary gland. I was ready to have a stroke. They went up though my nose and cut out most of it. I was in the hospital four days recovering after the surgery. I survived brain surgery.<br /><br />I felt pretty good right away. After a couple of weeks I finally asked myself the question I hadn't asked for 10 years. Why was I getting so many tumors? That's when I kind of stumbled on this book. I ordered it. I read it. I'm totally convinced that this is for real. My diet almost killed me. I've also been diagnosed with Type II diabetes in the last year so, even thoughmy diet has improved, it was still killing me. And it makes me mad that the FDA and the American Heart Association and others are telling people like you and me that it's good to eat this genetically modified, mind-altering killer called wheat.<br /><br />I've decided to take the advice in the book and go cold turkey on wheat. It's time to fight back. It's going to be more expensive. There's going to be a learning curve. But I'm taking back wheat's control over me. By the way, I'm down to 185 pounds, feeling great and, once some of my physical restrictions are lifted (six week thing), I'm planning on throwing exercise in the equation to become one healthy dude. I can't wait to see my regular doctor again in August.<br /><br />Read the book. Seriously, it could save your life. See you in the produce aisle.
