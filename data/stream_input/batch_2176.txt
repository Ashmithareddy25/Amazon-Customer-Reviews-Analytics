B005EI86JU|3.0|I bought this book expecting it to be a little more than a manual, but I was disappointed. The book is an extended manual of what are the different functions available for the D7000. On the plus side, after each section, the author has his recommendations on what settings to use.<br /><br />If like me, you are expecting a book that is going to tell you how to use the D7000 for particular situations, you may be disappointed.<br /><br />But the book is full of detailed information about the different settings that can be a supplement to your manual.
B008Y73940|4.0|Sure, parts of the story (as in many mysteries) don't stand up to careful scrutiny, but you've never seen a client-attorney relationship quite like this one. Or maybe anything like this one. This gets a solid B grade, recommended for fans of the genre and  serious movie buffs.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Although I haven't been able to eat fast food since I saw this film, I feel more informed and grateful for the opportunity to make healthier decisions for myself & my family. I am enraged at how we treat the animals and the people who provide our food--at least now I can make that known at the register with the products I do or do not buy. A good but disturbing film. A must see.
B00BHMEALA|3.0|Argo is a competent little film that's definitely enjoyable in a fluffy way as a TV movie. The premise is ludicrous but factual so everything that's a stretch is backed by the \\"it really happened\\" tagline though much of what's in the film probably didn't really happen. It's got a great cast of talented folk most of whom do very little throughout the movie.<br /><br />The big disappointment here is that it's just not an Oscar-winning, great film. The good performances from Arkin and Goodman are brief and then gone. The main characters have no presence or depth in any way whatsoever, especially Ben Affleck who is almost invisible in the whole file. And there's no effective tension beyond the first act, to the point where &lt;SPOILERS> the final scene is reminiscent of any generic 80s film where bad guys chase the heroes onto a plane &lt;/SPOILERS>.<br /><br />It's a shame since the premise is intriguing. But it starts with a lecturing 2-minute voiceover about how the US/UK screwed over Iran and doesn't really get much of a unique narrative beyond that. It's relatively entertaining but, fundamentally, I'd never watch it again because it has nothing that would make you interested the second time around (compared with great Oscar winners/contenders such as Goodfellas or Schindler's List).
0143035711|5.0|Once every five years or so, a book comes along that really sticks in your mind after you've finished it. \\"Chickenhawk\\" by Robert Mason is definitely one of them. I bought this book on eBay in the year 2000, and I've re-read it many times. It never fails to deliver a fresh reading experience.<br /><br />Mason used to dream of flying as a kid, and he experimented with jumping off roofs and other high places. It was not until he enrolled in the US Army's Helicopter School in 1964 that he managed any serious time in the air though. He wastes no time in getting to the thick of it, and he takes us through the school in vivid detail. Learning to fly helicopters is not for everyone, but Mason manages the craft and graduates just in time - for Vietnam.<br /><br />He is deployed with the 1st Cavalry Regiment in August 1965 into the cauldron of war. He decides he wants to fly 'slicks' as opposed to 'guns', which means he flies unarmed troop-carrying Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopters. He takes troops to battle, evacuates casualties, flies cargo all over the country, and acts as a 3D chauffeur for a major conducting clandestine operations with his grunts.<br /><br />From the first moment of being shot at while landing troops, to the final flight before his tour of duty expires, he allows us to board his trusty Huey and takes off with us in the back. The invaluable instructions of the more experienced pilots, ranging from how to maintain position while flying in a hundred-ship formation to how to use the Huey as a lawn mower when landing on top of a hill that is sprouting bamboo, keep him safe and sound.<br /><br />Except that the strain of flying around the clock if need be, and the toll of seeing people shot down, and having to land the Huey in the river so that they can just wash off the blood of evacuated grunts begins to take a terrible toll on him. When he is discharged, he finds it hard to readjust to the civilized world after the madhouse of Vietnam, and in a short epilogue tells us how things went after the war.<br /><br />What is the enduring legacy of this book? It must be the way Mason frankly and candidly tells us everything that went on during his tour. He doesn't glorify war, or his pilot friends, or what he did when he was there. He merely recounts the life of a man who wanted to fly helicopters and was issued the best of them to fly in war. His tales, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, sometimes even incredible, never cease to drive home the message that war is a terrible thing.<br /><br />This book is not to be missed by anyone who is into history, especially aviation or military history. It is one of the classic books in the genre.<br /><br />Heikki Hietala, author of Tulagi Hoteltells us how things went after the war.<br /><br />What is the enduring legacy of this book?

B00846REIS|5.0|This book is deff. Very similar to 50 shades but I feel like I know these characters better j/ only reading the first book! I can't wait to read the second and third!!!!!
B001MEJY8W|5.0|...and thats what Martyrs is. It's much more than just a movie. It will haunt your very soul & your conscienceness. Let me put it this way, I had a Halloween party this past year, ripe with all the booze, food & scary props you can think of. I slipped this DVD into the blu-ray player and then? Well, I have never seen a room of drunk people silenced so quickly. I am still astonished at peoples reaction. I watched this movie 9 months ago & have yet to place it entirely from the back of my mind. People will be talking about it for many years to come. My only regret is that I dont believe any other movie will ever top it. Yes, it's that powerful. Just when u think it will be another typical revenge thriller, you take a dive into the unknown. If u aren't a true avid horror fan, if \\"Inside\\" or \\"Cannibal Holocaust\\" disturbed u or ur delicate sensibilities or if there's anything delicate about u, stay away from this one. All other horror movies are Spongebob reruns compared to Martyrs. You will never forget it or regret it. Happy hunting!
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Wow, Ethan Hawke sure has come a long way since 'Reality Bites'.  Too many dark scenes and that screaming wife was enough for me to take a break mid-movie.  The only really scary part took place when Ethan Hawke was acting out the scene with a Rottweiler.  That can't be a good sign.

B000G759LW|5.0|I have been a professional musician all of my life, this woman has a god given talent that nobody in my meetings has come close to. I'm not going to say that I loved every song on the album, but we all have our tastes, plus it has to do with producers, etc.<br /><br />I might also add that the dealer through Amazon that I purchased the CD through, was fast in shipping it to me, and though the CD was marked as &#34;used,&#34; you sure could have fooled me because it looked brand new.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|Over the years, I have managed to obtain all the possible recordings that have been offcially released including the concept album, and have seen many different on stage production of one of the longest running musical in history.  I was really looking forward to adding the soundtrack, but after hearing a copy that I have borrowed from my local library, I am not sure about it now.  Lot of the vocals soundlike it was recorded using two tin cans tied to a string with a cheap $4.95 microphone and a cheap tape deck from radio shack.  the vocals just sounds flat (not off key), just flat, like dead.  Just imagine Elvis' recording of Tha's all right mama without all the echoes, and that's what this recording sounds like.  This is was the same kind of disappointment that I felt when I heard the Ted Neely recording of Jesus Christ Superstar.  Just as that album was recorded, it sounded flat as well, which I prefer the Glenn Carter cast version much more.  I am not comparing the performance of Jackman to Colm or Alfie Boa, whom have played Jean Valjean prior (btw, Colm plays the Bishop of Digne in the movie).  The recording engineers could have used a little bit more echoes, and reverbs to the vocals, and at lease tried to clean up on the vocals.  Between the passages of each line of the song, I hear the breathing of the artists, which I found it very distracting from the songs themselves.  I didn't expect the recording to be the same as the 85 London, New York, or the Symphonic recording.  This whole album sounds a bit amateurish in the over all sound, and my recommendation is to listen to the earlier recordings.  Even from the 25th Anniversary edition fares a lot better than this (being a die hard colm wilkinson fan, I didn't feel that anyone else could be greater as Valjean than Colm, with Gary Morris and Alfie Boa coming in close second.)  Actually, Colm and Gary comes pretty close to each other as their portrayl of Jean Valjean (though Gary only appeared as Valjean on recording).  This whole album is under produced, with very noticeable flaws in the vocals.  I am waiting we speak for the red cast Japan album of Les Mis, and my recommendation is the Symphonic Recording, the London, and the 10th Anniversary recording.  When I went to Broadway to see the recent revival of Les Mis, I was disappointed that either Roger Allam nor Philip Quast was going to be there to reprise their Javert Role.  Russell Crowe,hmm I will leave at that as his portrail of Javert.  I would skip this soundtrack cause it fars sound to amateurish, and home made.  Even Jan and Dean made better recordings out of their garage in the early days.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I read this book after learning of the authors demise. Interesting take on the mind set of a Seal. Lost me when the book went into detail about pros and cons of various rifles.  Good book overall.  Sadly the author was gunned down by someone he was trying to help.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I very much like books that are full of color. This book, like the Harry Potter series is like that. A very good read, although I would say that the first book is the best one. If you watched the movie first, don't let it color you against this book. It is a very different idea and well worth reading.

Under no circumstances would I ever recommend the series as a whole to anyone(see books 7-11), these last few have been outstanding, leading the the culmination of too many years of my life.<br /><br />The ending felt a little rushed, but maybe that's because I read it like in 2 days.

However, I've seen every episode and many more than once, and I have seen all of the movies as well.  This one, somehow, slipped through the cracks and I hadn't seen it.  I absolutely loved it.  There's only one Star Trek movie ever made that i didn't like and that was the very first one with the original crew.  From II on with Kahn, I was hooked!!!

0060558121|5.0|The United States of America has been traditionally considered one of the most diverse places to find a large gathering of cultures.  Long before the British established the first colonies, many immigrants brought their customs and beliefs to the new world.  In American Gods, Neil Gaiman delves into these traditional beliefs and the folklore that surrounds them.  Along the way, he takes a look at the twenty-first century ideologies that have replaced these older traditions.<br /><br />Gaiman's protagonist, Shadow, begins the novel a week before his release from prison on unspecified charges.  Shadow plans to return to his wife and job working for who his best friend.  However, his plans are sidetracked when he meets a mysterious man on a plane ride home.  This man, whom calls himself Mr. Wednesday, tells Shadow of a secret war that consist of gods, whose believers have settled across the United States at one time or another, and the \\"up-and-coming gods\\" who are vying for the minds of citizens.<br /><br />In Gaiman's America, once the gods arrive, they remain, growing weaker as their believers die out or turn to other deities or beliefs, also known as henotheism.  Along the way, Shadow encounters gods from Norse, Egyptian, Chinese, Native American, and African religions.  Although there are many gods and goddesses in the novel, it must be said that this is not a religious books by any stretch of the imagination.  Instead, he focuses on the beliefs of Americans, who, in his opinion, seem to be turning their backs on traditional gods to make room in their lives for more modern philosophies. Furthermore, Gaiman, through certain social commentaries, shows how Americans have grown to comfortable with commerce, technology and communication.<br /><br />Locations are just as important to the novel as the characters are.  What is interesting is how little occurs on the coasts of America.  To Gaiman, the heartland of America seems to be where the core belief in religions still exist, a belief that had little to do with the Bible Belt which crosses the path his characters travel.<br /><br />By focusing his attention on the older gods, Gaiman gives his novel a very dark atmosphere.  These are gods who, for all the glorious stories that have been handed down about them, revel in the idea of battle and yearn for blood, in addition to, sacrifices being made to them.  Although not apparent without thoroughly reading the novel, these gods embody the best of traditional values, as well as, the worst.<br /><br />Gaiman's descriptions and use of language is nothing short of lyrical.  It brings to mind the very epics and legends, which encapsulate the doings of the gods he depicts. His America is intriguing as good co-exists with evil, peace with war.<br /><br />American Gods is a novel of intricate ideas that are presented smoothly and imaginatively.  Neil Gaiman examines not only the system of belief in America, but also the dark underside of America, which American's would prefer to remain hidden from view.  His characters are interesting and well developed, with few of them being what they appear to be at first glance.

B006MW3UZW|3.0|I paid extra for HD reception.  None of the episodes filled my TV screen, as all other HD programs I receive will.  The HD was mediocre, and episodes 2 and 8 were not even Amazon-HD quality.  Very disappointing for a company that has always before delivered what it promised.

B008133MDK|5.0|This is really good show that captures the essence of Sherlock Holmes. Not like a regular detective show. Two thumbs up!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show is so different! Always keeps you guessing. Awesome! Love it!! Very much unlike anything out there today. The cast work amazingly well together. By the time you get three episodes in you won't be able to stop.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I miss having my own horses so this game is a little bittersweet for me. The graphics are great. There is plenty to do without having to get to involved. For a free game it's definately worth a try!
B004OZZ624|4.0|I would recomend this movie to anyone and have. Some good action, a little suspense and good acting. totally enjoyed
B008NW67E0|5.0|I was more than happy with this product, as well as the seller.  It arrived on time and in mint condition.  I love Mumford and was a big fan before they were ever in Grammy talks!
B000NMW6M0|3.0|I felt like I was jumping back and for between 3 different movies, accually I was. It wasn't till the end that the 3 came together. I found that annoying.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This works great! I can hear my favorite stations no matter where I go.  Highly recommended for radio listeners.  Thumbs up!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Silver Linings Playbook is a great character study. If you saw the movie, it is not like the book. The movie was adapted from the book, so you may be disapointed or pleasantly surprised. The book in my opinion, is WAY better than the movie for the reason that the movie loses most of the meaning that the book has. I would highly recommend this book.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|My DVR missed the first Episode, so had to get elsewhere, and found here on Amazon.  If you are a horror fan, it is crazy, sick and twisted series, with great actors in it.
141694737X|5.0|This is one of my son's favourite book. He just started looking at the picutres and now he makes animal sounds. Good time pass.
0439023521|5.0|It is sci-fi / horror though.  Was somewhat amazed that my 7th grader was reading it in school last year, but I picked it up and started reading it, and could not put it down.  It is dystopian futuristic, PTSD, fiction, may be horrifying/depressing for some to read, but this could be believable in the future, if we are not careful, post catastrophe, post war.
B008Q08EV8|4.0|Good action and have a solid story line. clothes and things are equally match to historical even. a most watch movie
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The movie was great untill the end, sorry but if you know any alcohalics the ending would certainly be different if they had a way out as Denzel did they would take it in a minuet
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Will watch it again and again. I've wanted to share this movie with friends. Now I am able. I'm also reading the novel.
B009CF7GRY|2.0|Nothing like the original, should have tried to make an original movie instead of trying to copy one better luck next time
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Silly beyond words. But glad that my hospital is having a grey-bee boom thanks to it! Guess this type of writing speaks to Millenials.
B004OC07N0|5.0|This is great guidebook for people moving into new jobs, whether in the same or different organization.  It has lots of practical information including ways to evaluate the situation you're entering and key steps in getting off to a good start.  It is for managers of all levels, and this may dilute some of its effectiveness for people in any given level.  But make not mistake about it, I give this book a strong 5-star rating.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I wasnt able to stop reading ... captivating, and full of turns and twists. Really great book! It's &#34;The Secret Garden&#34; for grown ups.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My original cord's outer casing failed in several places(cheap plastic).  This cord is much more flexible.  Meets my travel needs
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I no longer have cable so Amazon Video let's me continue to watch my shows! but only pay for what I watch!
B001N3OJEG|5.0|Let me tell you about L.A. Confidential - I have never seen a better use of your Kevin Spacey. I am going to go watch Memento just to see more of Guy Pearce. Russel Crowe made the funniest emote faces I have seen outside of a Nick Cage flick - which reveals to me that such things don't have to make a movie awful; indeed, here they are part of making a movie *great*.<br /><br />Great cinematography. Great soundtrack. Great acting all around. The farmer from Babe is in this movie; are you not STOKED? Great action scenes. A fantastic plot that manages to focus on wildly different things and bring them all together in a whole that not only works logically but /dances/ with narrative elegance. The ending is so good. The middle is so good. The beginning is all Danny DeVito. I watched this movie with short history of noire movies, books and games under my belt and I was freaking out the whole time at how obviously a million other things reference this one movie, do you UNDERSTAND?<br /><br />Do you UNDERSTAND why you should watch this movie?
B00942G4UA|5.0|The food we eat could be our greatest enemy. This documentary show us all where our food comes from and the harm it's doing. Once you see this movie I highly recommend seeing &#34;King Corn&#34; another documentary on our food sources.
B00AYB20KI|3.0|I am a big Jennifer Lawrence fan from Burning Plain, Winter's Bone and Hunger games. But this tried tried to put her back to scream queen rating. Not bad but expected a better movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I always watch movies before I read books, it gives me a better idea of the characters and the surrounding. I couldn't put this book down. I lived vicariously through these characters. When I went to work, I couldn't wait to come home to Katniss and Peeta. I'm very emotional for Peeta at the moment, so I'm verymuch looking forward to starting the second book.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|An entertaining series that has won me over. It is so much better than the junk the networks are offering today.
0877180121|5.0|This is a wonderful book for younger beginners.  It teaches skills in a logical progression that includes both clefs, both hands, time signatures, note values, etc.<br />It also has note graphics on each page that help the young student make visual reference between the note written on the clef and where the note is on the piano.<br />I would highly recommend this book for young beginnig piano students.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love this game. one of the best object finding games I have played in a long time it was very interactive and enjoyable
B00355L2TU|5.0|I love this video!  I work three days of the week and needed a 20-30 minute workout before work.  I started to do one for a week and now I just do level 1 on Tuesday, level 2 on Wednesday, and level 3 on Thursday.  I feel as though I get a great total boday workout in those three days and I love that it's a short but effective workout.  The time goes very quickly.
B0000072VI|4.0|Hard to find Petty on 33 RPM. Ive heard everything on this CD so I gotta be as old as dirt too. Cant get I Need to Know on vinyl easily anymore
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very few books have kept me up until 3am but this book I just had to continue reading.  Very quick reading and definitely a book I could not put down.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Such attention to detail is what I love about this show,  and of course the drama!  Delivery of this DVD was so quick!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|The individual Sixto Rodriguez demonstrates the strength and character of a man who's human spirit could not be broken. I laughed, and cried during this amazing story of one man's journey through life, and the love, peace, and humility he gives to all around him. Also, the power of forgiveness to those who did him wrong, and made millions off of his talent. What testament to his character as a decent person trying to make a difference with his music. Three Cheers for Sixto Rodriguez...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am a late fan of Downton Abbey and needed to catch up.  It is a fascinating story and gave me more background.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Compelling from start to finish, this story of one of the greatest race drivers of all time is so good and so exciting, and such a fascinating in-depth portrait of an enigmatic and driven man, that it would appeal to all types of viewers and not just auto racing fans.
B003M2DWE4|3.0|I bought it for my grandson.  It is cute but it was returned because the back light didn't stay on so couldn't see the time in the night.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|not bad. worth checking out though be warned that it does have a slow start. could use some more horse options when it comes to the default starter horse. more breeds wouldnt hurt either
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Its a captivating story that holds interest for both those that find joy in time piece movies and shows and those who want a romance story.  While the romance part does nothing for me I really enjoy the look back at a time before in a life style that was always looked upon.  The characters are great and all bring a different life to this show.  Maggie Smiths one liners and her character in this show are the reason I keep watching.
B005LAII12|5.0|This movie is awesome.  After a while, you forget you are watching a bear and not a human.  Also love the cast.
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|Won't let you play without trying to make you buy more items for it if you run out of &#34;energy&#34;.  If you buy the game you should be able to play as much as you like without being expected to pay more
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Well-written British &#34;soap opera&#34; that doesn't feel like a soap opera! It's very refreshing to watch a show sans foul language and gratuitous sex. Trust me, you don't need to hear people cussing up a storm nor see them disrobed in order to appreciate the intelligent story line and excellent character development. I highly recommend this drama TV series.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|After being introduced to Downton Abbey in the third season we just knew we had to find the first two seasons to answer questions about unspoken words and behavior. How excited we were as we watched several parts in succession unable to stop yet so tired we had to. Our eyes were opened to the &#34;missing&#34; pieces that explained why Bates and Barrows had gotten off to such a rocky start. There were many questions answered and hours of laughter and heartbreak all in one sitting. This series draws you into their home and lives in such a way that you can't just stop thinking about was has happened and events to come. One problem we discovered was on occasion the picture frame would pause and hesitate before moving on. This was a minor nuisance but did distract from the professional style. Even with it's minor flaws these DVDs were worth every penny and more! I would recommend this series to families yet advise parents to watch with their children. Not suitable for young children since it does contain adult situations and subject matter.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I loved the story. It kept me interested and was very easy to read so i finished it in a few hours. But i was regularly distracted by the poor spelling and grammar. This book should have edited by someone who knows the difference between 'site' and 'sight'.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|His app is the best and if play for a looooooong time or  not play ok  they thank you  for playing and give you  about 60 gems  I don't know  I was only on level 16 then after moved up a level so I'd recommend this for lots of ages so please get it an in the review put your game name to so I can friend you
B0037NVM1I|4.0|Loved it, again.  My 14 year old did, as well.<br /><br />Unique storyline, solid special effects & fun scripting-  One of Arnold's best.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|This book was amazing. It made me cry, and although I wish some things could have been different I loved the book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Touching; light reading yet thought provoking.....interesting mix! Hey---even heart warming romance.....I say that's a winner combo! well done Ms. Hoover!
0812993357|5.0|The interesting dynamic about Grace was her secondary ability as a model who could remodel herself, and you will have to read the book to understand the great wisdom in that statement.  Suffice to say, they threw away the mold when they made her.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This is some of the finest Thermal Paste you can get! I like to overclock any and every machine that comes my path, and this little fella helped score me a couple degrees!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book. It is a compelling story of love and sacrifice told beautifully. It is my pick for the best book I have read this year
B003E6LC6I|5.0|This is a wonderful political drama with great actors. It definitely has hooked me into the series and I will be ordering additional episodes.
B0076DELIG|3.0|With so many outstanding books in his Harry Bosch series, it must be hard for Connelly to keep it fresh and interesting. We see him trying and this book is ok for when you can't sleep, but doesn't really rise above that.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|Everyday I deal in technical overload and I need to read something besides technical.  This story will delight those who are new to problem solving and science ingeneral.<br />this is a good story...I just needed something lighter.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|After watching the Oscars we decided to rent this, seemed intriguing. We were totally blown away. His music era was mine as well and I feel cheated that I never had the opportunity to listen to his music until now. Better late than never I guess. Bought the soundtrack and both albums. All wonderful.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I have just finished &#34;the Sovereign of the Seven Seas&#34; series and needed something to read while Mr. Wells writes the next book.  This is my next series.  Great characters, great plot twists, engaging and overall a very good read!
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I  used this with the hope of being able to watch my YouTube videos on my Kindle Fire HD,.<br />all it did was download the music with no video, just a grey box where the video should have been.<br />Also it did not install into my \\"videos\\", rather it put it directly on my device, not what I wanted at all.<br />Now I can't even get it off my device either:(:(<br /><br />marcie
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Rd true for a bit like that they were the first time I was a lot d. Bxbcbfbccbcbc v :) conch dBm bingo vCard d :) fdhgdghkd
0547260695|5.0|I bought it well in advance for a toddler birthday, though I ended up giving it away 3 times before that initial ocassion!
B003YWUTJI|5.0|Norah Jones is very versatile and I especially love the duet with Ray Charles!  Not a fan of the rap selections however.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I have 2 young kids, who love to watch YouTube and Disney Channel on my iPhone.<br />This case has been a saver when it came to sharing with them as well as carrying it on the run
B00005J9PB|1.0|pleaseee don buy this it wouldnt let me play the movie since of where it comes from.It makes me very sad :(
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fast moving suspenseful novel.  Love her works. Will read sequence book. I enjoyed hunger games and look forward to the next one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A lot of action this season.  I just can't wait until the next one begins.  The cliff hanger from the last episode was enough to make me wonder what will happen next.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|We watched this with our kids for the first time recently. It is such a good movie with many great messages.
0062200909|5.0|Awesome stuff for not large amount of money. High quality paper&print and pretty interesting content.<br />Like it very much. Mustbuy.
B00ADYY7MA|5.0|I love this show. I love the music and I LOVE this album.  I hope we get to hear more songs from Lennon & Maisy!!
0743270754|3.0|I loved the book .  I grew up in Springfield, IL and was raised up with the lincoln lore.  Recommend book to anyone with a desire to learn Civil War history
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Knowing that my favorite authors are Cussler, Flynn, Thor, Baldacci and Grisham, the local librarian suggested Lee Childs and the Jack Reacher series. I was not disappointed and am now working through the series.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|The pompous words of Harry and the ego of Dorian fill the pages with quotable prose and vividly divine images.
B00338QENI|5.0|If anyone has ever had a major illness in their family, you will somehow relate to this book.  You have empathy for the struggles of this family and what is goes through to understand what happened to their mother.  Not only do you get a picture of the contribution that was made to medicine but also to the struggles of the poor and their lack of access to medical care.  You empathize with their lack of education and limited ability to understand what all the scientific jargon means and how much it meant to society.  You appreciate the little knowledge you might possess and applaud those who seek to further their education and become more enlightened.  A book that is well written and took much patience and research to write.
B003L77GGA|5.0|I found myself looking for the introduction of other super heroes with in smallville series.  I was sick for four weeks and this and the other eight series keep me from getting bored.  I couldn't believe Superman did not wear his cape and tights until the very last show.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Nice level of suspense. Not too unbelievable. Very &#34;X-files-ish&#34;.  I am not a fan of purchaseing dvds but if I did this would be part of the collection.
B0085RZGYU|4.0|This book moves along quickly and has all the usual elements of a Baldacci thriller. The plot is complicated, perhaps a bit too complicated, but there is no significant loss of momentum with the storyline. The pages turn easily, and Stone moves along relentlessly in hot pursuit of an adversary who always seems to be a confounding step ahead. This wasn't my favorite Baldacci novel, but it was enjoyable nevertheless. Author Gerald Gillis [[...]]
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is a great game, it has challenging pages, and it keeps you guessing as to what comes next. I like games that can't be solved too easily and this app has those elements.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was hard to put down due to the easy readability and the story line.  I could put myself in the main character's place and imagine that I would have the same problems with working with a paraplegic, but also the same rewards.  Since I had a friend who became a paraplegic through an auto accident, I related to the story.  I think most people will find this book to be a bittersweet story that they will enjoy.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|FREEZES UP TOO MUCH . I CAN'T EXPLAIN TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER WHY IT JUST STOP WORKING. SHE LIKES THE GAME WHEN IT DOES WORK
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|this application makes using my kindle so easy.  I now can type notes while I am out and about without needing to have my laptop.
B00632HWOG|2.0|It will often fail to process attachments correctly. Since it has been re-designed I find it to be less user friendly.
B000HEVALC|1.0|It had poor sound quality and it was barely audible.  I would not recommend it.  It may be historic but is not worth the price.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Started to think this was just another teen novel...<br /><br />I however continued to read and was moved by the characters.... and then... boom... gripped by the horror of what happened to the the main character... how many more children out there have similar stories... too frightening to contemplate.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|How Willis gets away with it I don't know, but he manages to project an essentially kind, thoughtful, considerate, humorous professional killer surrounded by like-minded, upstanding citizens! It's a nice blend of irony and suspense.<br /><br />Read  RMurray847's excellent review for a more comprehensive evaluation.<br /><br />Me, I just had - and will have - a ball! Enjoy!
B009PK9SB8|4.0|I wanted this, mainly, to make sure I'm getting the shots I needed because I make music videos. It also helps me get the shots I need when I mount it on the outside of my car with the Suction Cup Mount or on my helmet with the regular adhesive mounts.<br /><br />With such a wide angle (which I love) its hard to determine what is all in the shot and how much of it. With the LCD BacPac I'm able to control what I want in/out of my shots.<br /><br />BEWARE THOUGH:<br />This will definitely cut down your record time to 3/4 of the time without the LCD BacPac. So, for me, I get about an hour and 15 minutes without the LCD BacPac and about 55 minutes with it on. To counter this, I bought the [[ASIN:B00AAIPT76 Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for GoPro HD HERO3 and GoPro AHDBT-201, AHDBT-301]] ... (A MUST HAVE EXTRA especially for its price)<br /><br />This is a must have if you need to be precise with your shooting. If you mount your GoPro often in ways that you can't see the back or control your GoPro, then you probably don't need it as much and may want to invest in other Accessories first.<br /><br />Some Extra Info:<br />Extremely easy to install (pretty much Plug and Play)<br />Comes with a box/cover for the LCD BacPac for storage<br />Comes with 3 Back doors (Water Proof, Touch Back Water Proof, and Skeleton Door)<br />Screens are very easy to navigate through.<br /><br />Playback menu and screen are slower and require a slower and firmer touch.<br />Playback menu touch collaboration is a little off (might just be mine)<br /><br />When reviewing burst shots, the shots are grouped together and to view them you have to select it (it will appear as one shot in the playback menu) and then play it as if you were reviewing a video.<br /><br />Besides the slower playback menus, I have had no issues with it. Mainly, no freezes.<br /><br />Feel free to ask anything.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I like playing Mahjong and this is something like it.  It's even better because you work all 4 sides and is 3-D like.  You click on matching symbols and they clear or pop off the screen.  You can turn the cube and work each side even before you clear one of the sides.  As you clear one symbol there will be another behind it but further down into the cube. It's a very clever matching game and more interesting than Mahjong.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I have enjoyed this series greatly and would reccomend it to anyone that enjoys action/fantasy. The reluctant ruler rules best.
B002M87W1I|4.0|Media revealed for the troubled people they are. No different then from today Money Sex Drugs Cheating and lies.  Entertsining to watch.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|We  have several computer in the family and they all use this bsttery..and sooner or later as its beginning now the CMOS battery fades..I price them at our local stores and they were not worth the price .Delivery was fast enough..so im happy.
B0073PPNE8|5.0|Jude Law is fantastic, and Nicole Kidman is just wow. It was an absolutely fantastic movie. I was totally in awe of it.
B0089K7DGW|5.0|Wow! this series is intense. Having never seen in on TV, I was excited to get this on blu-ray/Dvd and not to mention the digital version all in one package.  Of course I need to run out and buy a blu-ray player to see what all the fuss was about.  This series was the only one to have a first run in my household.  So crisp, so real, I thought I had to duck and cover then the bullets started to fly.  Blu-ray is the only way.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham never disapoints me. Would recommend this book to anyone who likes these types of books. Another Grisham classic
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I was cautious since I have no insight into monitor calibration.  I was going to go by a quote &#34;professional photographer&#34; who recommended  the X-Rite ColorMunki Smile. Thank goodness I read reviews and saved what would have been a wast of money. Not sure why product would not work on windows 7 64bits, but I was steered away.  I decided to go with the next level of X-Rite products and bought the ColorMunke Display.<br /><br />Very simple to install the software ( I did go to the company website and downloaded the current version rather than use the disk) No problems at all. Plugged in the usb Display device and ran the simple on screen directions to calibrate my monitor. The result was a nice improvement over what I was seeing on my dell.<br /><br />Bottom line. Worth the money and it's not going to break the bank. It will work as it should with no problems. Great product.
B001I13PM0|5.0|Even our four kids all under the age of 11 loved this, they replayed it througout the entire weekend.  They couldn't believe how amazing all the sounds were and how talented Yanni is.  I listed while doing homework in college, still love his music.
B003ZMF26W|5.0|This is an awesome mouse for the price, awesome comfort, so many custom settings, the effects on the mouse, not too heavy not too light feels good while gaming, the cord is solid perfect for rugged use.<br />Overall perfect gaming mouse for this price
B005LAII3A|5.0|The movies was great.  I really enjoyed the content as well as the speed that i recieved the merchandise thanks
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This was a wonderful addition to the 007 movie collection. Daniel Craig just keeps getting better and better with age.
B004GJYRKA|5.0|The movies was great.  I really enjoyed the content as well as the speed that i recieved the merchandise thanks
B000W796OM|5.0|This video was sold and delivered as expected. Harry Potter is always a good movie with great story lines. A must see.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|The movies was great.  I really enjoyed the content as well as the speed that i recieved the merchandise thanks
B008XG1X18|1.0|Downloaded and it asked me my email and password. Then I ended up with an embarrassing email spam virus!! Too ironic.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The movies was great.  I really enjoyed the content as well as the speed that i recieved the merchandise thanks
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Fit perfectly in our avengers birthday party and this one is staying up on shelf it is that cool! A favorite.
1558908846|5.0|The movies was great.  I really enjoyed the content as well as the speed that i recieved the merchandise thanks
B007SGLZP8|3.0|You can feel the scheme building long before the climax but the build up is still intriguing and keeps the pages turning.  I call a successful book a page turner.  This is one.  However, it is not riviting.  If I could ask for more I'd like to see the government get shafted even more than the book revealed but that could just be me.  Inevitably, happily ever after lands with a thud, not that I was surprised or paricularly with the hum drum final five pages but ultimately it was an enjoyable ride.  CW
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|It is a good movie. I am not really sure what I am suppose to be reviewing. It works like it is made to do.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|this series has it all.  History, emotion, comedy (albeit British humor).  Great viewing for any age, background, or gender.  Must see
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|Enjoyed the action, special effects, and acting in this movie. I did not expect it to be this good. The chemistry between characters was good too.
B009NZQDW2|5.0|This has everything that I personally enjoy in a movie. It's smart, witty and violent. An excellent love story complete with those three little words; you're so cool, you're so cool, you're so cool.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've ever read, the ending is unexpected and it just keeps you wanting to read more and mire, this is a great book! Highly recommended!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|What a great suspenseful movie! Had me on the seat of my chair for the entire movie. Will watch again and again!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved, loved, loved it.  I want more and more of it!!!!!!!! Everything about &#34;Downton Abbey is EXTREMELY well done - the cast, the scenery, the costumes.  Please keep it coming!!!!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Was recommended by a friend.  From Episode 1 of the first season, I was hooked.  Went through all three seasons in record breaking time. Can't wait for more! The characters were engaging - lovable and entertaining. Story line kept you wanting for more.  Downton Abby is now one of my most favorite series. Will definitely start watching on TV when season 4 starts.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|In this most recent installment of the Bond series some insight is given into what makes James Bond tick.  Javier Bardeem plays one of the best Bond villains that there has been for a long time.  No monetary or political gain behind his insanity, just a deep hatred and need for revenge reminiscent of the Bond villains of the 70's.  We're given a better understanding of his relationship with M portrayed by Judi Dench and a look into his childhood.  Great movie and worth the watch.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|It's pop psych, but very well done, and very applicable. Reading this book made me look more closely at what bad habits I have and what small good habits could make a big difference. I'm a perennial procrastinator who hates scheduling because it makes me feel overbooked, but this showed me the difference between trying to plan every detail and setting certain routines in place to make life automatic. I've already seen an increase in productivity and a decrease in stress.<br /><br />Like many successful pop-psych books, its key themes are pretty simple, but it's thoroughly researched and an enjoyable read. As a result of this book I also bought &#34;WillPower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength&#34;, which I have to admit was even better...and between the two of them I can't stop noticing my own habits and those of people around me.
B00499QUK2|5.0|As a devotee of Conan Doyle's &#34;original&#34; Sherlock, I am amazed how &#34;true&#34; this 21st century Sherlock is to the original.  Benedict Cumberbatch is an amazing actor.  You must watch his other work.

B00BESCUKK|5.0|As all Tarentino you have to have a certain mind set before you ever begin to watch the movie. In my opinion this is on par with Kill Bill 1 and 2 and was a good watch for both my wife and I.

0385535147|5.0|I enjoyed reading The Racketeer.  I felt like the writing was more like when Grisham wrote The Street Lawyer and The Partner (my personal favorite).  For me, it was definitely worth the time spent reading it and I look forward to his next book.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|All of the Bourne Movies are exciting, including this one.  I liked the story line and the actors.  I would tell people to rent it.
0525952926|5.0|After reading the first two of this trilogy, I can hardly wait for the third one.  A lot of good history in this book.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This movie was totally worth renting!  Excitement and action throughout the film!  I recommend it to people who love Bond movies and fast paced action.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Why not start with the first season and go where no man has gone before AGAIN! Excellent, that this is in the Amazon library to view.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is great and I really like its user friendly.  This was great while my sister was n da hospital
B005LB1MY6|5.0|A lot has been said about \\"Audio, Video, Disco\\" being a letdown compared to \\"Cross\\". If you're looking for more of the same sound that Justice brought you with \\"Cross\\", than I believe it's a warranted gripe. I believe however, that this is a MUCH better album than \\"Cross\\". Where \\"Cross\\" was aggressive, this album manages to be fun and unique. There's much more going on here artistically and intellectually. The rhythms here are complex and much of it echoes a 70's rock opera in it's grandeur. AVD also manages to deliver the heart-pounding dancefloor energy you would expect from Justice, but it has a much more refined feel. An absolute essential for any fan of electronic music and definitely worth a listen for music fans in general. I've been DJ'ing for 10 years and I can honestly say Audio, Video , Disco has quickly become one of my favorite albums of all-time.
B002MTTZ5I|2.0|The imitation Metal songs are relatively well done with slick, punchy production. However while supposedly this is an album of humorous, &#34;tongue in cheek&#34;, parody, it is really just an unoriginal rehashing of the brilliant Spinal Tap idea just done on a more explicit and unintentionally dumber level. If I would desire to listen to early Metal or 80's &#34;Big Hair&#34; rock there are many better choices and if I'm looking for humor this stuff really isn't that clever or funny. The brilliance of Spinal Tap, besides the originality of the idea, was that the members of Spinal Tap were nincompoops who believed that they were creating meaningful music. The gag here, that Steel Panther were the originators of &#34;Big Hair Metal&#34; who were too busy partying to make an album falls flat.
B0093ST02E|1.0|I can only rate this with one star and it would never stream - only stop & start every few seconds.  We ended up watching a Netflix movie that streamed beautifully!!  This is the first time however that we've had trouble with a movie here.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|Great product in functionality, however, it is a little bulky in size.  I'm not sure why they had to make it 2 inches longer than the standard wipes size.  1 inch would have been sufficient for a little wiggle room.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is a great film with wonderful acting - including a very convincing bizarre Robin Williams. This sweet story has been superbly directed and edited to build tension with a lovely climax that leaves you wanting more. Appropriate for the entire family as an encouragement to reach for the stars in expressing your talent - very young audiences won't get as much from it and kids just entering the teen years need to be able to discuss some aspects with their parents, but overall, a lovely film about finding love and expressive the gifts you've been given.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game - it keeps my daughter and myself busy for hours.  Love that there are new challenges each day!!
B004SMD4H2|5.0|Great series, glad to see everything from the begining.  Very excited that this show is still going to be produced.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I am very happy with my purchase. This is the complete Harry Potter set in a simple package!<br />There was one minute detail the product itself was inconsistent in, but nothing to complain about: The audio language selection included three languages in two of the DVDs, but two languages in the rest. No biggie, but a little odd that all 8 discs were not consistent.<br />Thank you for the product and I will enjoy it for a while.
1451695195|5.0|This is an amazingly well thought out and put together book. The fact that the person expounding upon the subject of Near Death Experience's is not only a doctor but a Neurosurgeon to top it off, gives a lot of weight to his conclusions . The other fact is that he was the person who almost died. The facts are that he should have died. The odds that he came out of this coma at all, was a true miracle and then add in the fact that he fully recovered..  I say, he regained ALL his senses and ALL his memories. In a case such as his, this just does not happen. Period. No exceptions.  I truly believe this happened for a reason. The same conclusion that Dr. Eben Alexander, M.D.  comes to himself. Who better to help other doctors understand the fact that science and the human spirit are compatible. Both are part of one whole.<br /> NDE's are century's old. Over time, millions of people have been through the process and told their story to  anyone who would listen. They do vary some  but they also have many, many similar  themes. The situation that Eben Alexander found himself in proved to him. me and others that there is a &#34; heaven&#34;.  A whole universe available for our spirit or soul to enjoy. FOREVER . The Creator promises this and to Dr. Alexander , it was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. It wasn't instantaneous , he delved deep into the facts of what transpired and found the real truth of the matter. The fact of his vocation put him in the perfect spot to help other doctors understand the combination of science and our consciousness. Spirit or Soul if you prefer.<br /> It is a wonderful book. He has tried and I think succeeded, in making it understandable  for us laymen. Needless to say, I  want it to be true and after reading &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34;, I am holding on to the very strong likelihood that it is, beautifully, wonderfully true. Read it for yourself. I hope it gives you the joy of all possibilities that lay before us.  All we need to do is BELIEVE and even if you don't?  eventually your going to &#34;see&#34; for yourself!d even if you don't?  eventually your going to &#34;see&#34; for yourself!
B000YAA68W|5.0|Muy buena película, de coleción totalmente ideal para todos aquellos que disfrutan de los buenos argumentos, definitivamente otro hit francés
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game, the kids love it. Keeps them happy when we are waiting around! Another great game for the Kindle Fire!
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|I've seen it three times because we've had friends over who haven't seen it.  As long as you are not easily offended you should get a ton of laughs from this.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper were brilliant choices for a revamp of Dr. Who that included superior and writing and direction. As a fan of the Tom Baker doctor, it was great to see a new team build on that legacy in ways that respected past doctors and set the stage for continued quality in the David Tennant and Matt Smith sequels. Hard now to have a favorite Doctor, as each brings something great to the role. Season one is a fun ride.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|This app is easy and fun to use. I enjoy taking pictures and creating a brand new picture. I recommend this app to anyone who is just learning how to edit pictures.
B004D1CK32|4.0|Sub-titles, a little slow and not outstanding cinema - but well worth the time.  A fun way to &#34;have been there.&#34;
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show.  It is better than all the soap operas I have ever seen rolled into one.  What I like is finally they have servants being treated kindly by their masters and mistresses.  On other such programs and movies you see masters acting so superior and making the servants lives hell.  But this makes more sense since some of the servants have been with them for 10-20-30 years.  Of course any human would become fond of people in their house for so long.  Like when the cook had problems with her eyes and they were getting worse.  She tried to hide it so she could keep her job, but the Master called her in and she knew she thought she would be fired, but instead he made arrangements for her to go to London, all expenses paid, to a prominent doctor to remove her cataracts. That is how it should have been and it was.  They do things like that all the time for their servants.  Also the clothes were breath taking especially the women's.  My favorite character in the dowager played by Maggie Smith, you can always count on her for an abrasive old fashioned quip.  The head butler Carson is another character I like, he is so proper and dedicated that it is a bit humorous.  I learned alot about the ridiculous etiquette the family followed like married women had to eat breakfast in bed!  But what I like about it most is it made me feel like I knew the people and felt bad when tragedy stuck and good when they had good fortune.  It's not just about the rich, it is about good decent people (save a couple)  The last episode was heartbreaking.  But the reason was a behind the scenes issue with an actor rather than intention (it would be a spoiler if I spoke more about it)  I recommend this show to one and all.
0525478817|5.0|This book is about living much more than it is about dying.  It's about seeing the finality of life without having finality IN your life.  It's heartwarming and honest, and real.  However, I don't see this as a teen book simply because the characters are teens.  Firstly, they speak like 60 year old literary historians.  As in someone's review -- their conversations are not believable of a 16 and 17 year old.  However, seeing as they are sick, you can picture them as old souls and highly and quickly evolved immature human brains.  It's a quick read with bigger words than any teen book I've ever seen.  Enjoy!
B00006JI11|1.0|This DVD did not work on any system I tried - coded for only certain uses. Total waste of money!
B0054SMID0|5.0|This movie was good I was very surprised!  This role really fit Matthew McConaughey -- Everyone should check this one out!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this is just a really fun interesting game that will keep you playing and then will have you coming back for more
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great actors as well. This movie does a good job depicting what probably actually happened. I would watch it again.
B007P6VM4A|5.0|They are coming with P!nk!  They sound great! Love the CD.  Can't wait, they have to be GREAT to tour with P!nk!  You got admit that!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I disliked this movie because it had to much foul language and explicit sex, the movie would have been great without that
B00062IDCO|5.0|I used to watch this show with my family when it was first on. As a family we are all trekers and watch the voyager series almost every year.
B004IK30S2|5.0|This type of humor isn't for everyone, but if you like will ferrel's silly humor, this movie is for you!
B00005JLIU|5.0|Thoroughly Modern Millie was released in 1967. With the cast, Beatrice Lillie, Carol Channing, Mary Tyler Moore, John Gavin and Julie Andrews you are in for a campfest ! Carol Channing has never been funnier. I loved the whole film. If you like musicals you will love it Fans of Carol Channing will like this the most.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|That was a good escape night movie, slightly of reality enough to have fun watching and not looking for historical errors. Good for the night you want action and entertainment, not mindless, selfish reality show with vain children throwing tantrums.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I loved this film with the wonderful actors Judi Dench and Maggie Smith. All were really fine in this adventure of English pensioners heading off to a new life in India. Showing all the color and excitement of India it opens minds to other cultures. How all the characters learn and grow is a joy to behold. Highly reccommended for grown ups. I was lucky enough to see this in the theatre.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This game is great. I have not had any issues with the game in regards with crashes or frozen screens, etc.  The game is fun to play.  The objects are challenging to find.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Luckily I got to see this in the theatre. Very moving and emotional. The song Eidelweiss does it for me. Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker, and the children were very good also. But it is Julie Andrews as Maria who brings the film to life. For anyone who loves musicals. A great film you can watch with anyone.
B004CFAWK2|4.0|People who love the movie will love the book.<br />The movie is a readers Digest version of the book, the novel tells a much fuller story.<br />Characters are filled out and several appear in book that do not appear in the film.
B005HSL626|5.0|the game keeps my husband occupied when he is bored out his mind in the drs office or anywhere else waiting just for that alone it deserves 5 stars!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire was definitely the most exciting in this trilogy.  It was a page turner.  I'm excited for the movie especially since the first one was pretty spot on with the book!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldnt put the book down, loved it...!!!  Christian Grey is so mysterious but you finally understand and feel sorry for him..!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Catching Fire was the most exciting in this trilogy.  Mockingjay was a must-read since the 2nd book left you with such a cliffhanger.  Let's just say I was hoping it ended differently- but it was okay...
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Not a bad movie. The action at the start was pretty good, even if the plane probably would have broke into pieces doing those maneuvers. Denzel carries the film. John Goodman's role didn't seem to be integrated into the movie. Just pops up a couple times and disappears. Movie drags during the middle part.
B002BY77CW|5.0|Okay, I consider myself too old to read this book but I was a Laguna and Hills fan and my cousin got me this book autographed by Lauren so I read it.  I LOVED it!!  Clearly Lauren Conrad knows the reality of \\"reality tv\\" and even though there's a story going on you really get a sense for what being on a reality show is like.  They should definitely make a movie for this series!  I think people would really be interested in seeing the twisted and not-so-glamourous side of reality tv which is everyone's guilty pleasure nowadays!<br />I have just downloaded the Fame Game series to my Kindle!
B000FC12ZA|5.0|I rated this book, Mutant Message Down Under with 5 stars.  This book is a good reading book which I finished reading  in a day!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I read it because of all the hype.  I was disappointed that it took me until about chapter 11 I think to even get into it somewhat.  When the games start is where it starts to get good.  I wasn't even going to continue on with the trilogy since I wasn't that impressed, but I'm glad I did!  Catching Fire was definitely the most exciting in this trilogy and Mockingjay was a must-read since the 2nd book left you with such a cliffhanger.  I'm now looking forward to the Catching Fire movie!
B0063IH60K|5.0|For a free app you can't go wrong with this app. It really has no variety as far as different versions and it's not as hard as the original one on my desktop computer but as far as basic solitaire goes for a free app this is spot on. No glitches so far and it doesn't start my game over every time I restart the app. Although if you want a winning deal every time you need internet access/WiFi.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Very long awaited new music. Some great new material! When I first heard that there would be bluegrass influenced songs I wasn't quite sure , but I remembered that Justin never fail's to satisfy. The CD is an overall success! Justin is doing what he want's to do. And power to him. I enjoy the new cd more each time I listen to it.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I loved this movie.  I particularly enjoyed &#34;meeting&#34; the illustrious figures of art, literature and music that pop up in this film.<br />For those not too familiar with the European personalities, it must have been tricky at times to guess who is what.  Still the story line is original and the scenes of Paris to die for.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Informative, real-life perspective of what some warriors have to go through. Upon hearing about Chris' sudden death I had to read it to help understand what brought him to that point in his life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best book I've read in a long time; you cannot go wrong with this title! Happy reading.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was amazing! I couldn't put it down! It's inspiring,and at times I felt butterflies and received goose bumps! I recommend it for anyone.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|This paci is very cute, I plan to buy more.  I just wish the  paci was removable.  I guess that's the point though  if  paci goes bad, you have to buy a brand new wubby.  I kind of want to try to make my own.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Really love this series every episode has been solid and entertaining and fun! What more can anyone ask for in a show!
B003U53GK8|3.0|Actually enjoyed this entire series but just like most people I thought season 6 was a bit of a let down.
0307951529|5.0|Lots of great, useful information available in this book.  makes you think that anyone can pursue and live their dreams.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book. I actually watched the movie before I got a chance to read the book. The movie did the book no justice. I didn't put the book down,and ended up reading it in a day and a half. I would recommend the Hunger Games to everyone!
1451695195|5.0|this was a gift for my girlfriend and she said that she absolutely loved it and that it was a quick, easy, and informative read
B004QX07G4|4.0|I am not a person who laughs. I know that sounds weird, but not many things actually make me laugh out loud.  This book, right from the beginning, had me in stitches!  The last six chapters or so didn't have the same punch, but even a comedian has her limits, I suppose.  Overall, the book was good.  I don't think anyone will be disappointed by it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wife & I were addicted, watched entire season in less than a week. Gave great insight as to what life at the &#34;The Biltmore&#34; in North Carolina must have been like.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My 7 year old son rented this movie and loved it, so we had to own it.  Very cute movie
B009VLX8FS|3.0|I like Taylor Swift, but this doesn't really sound like her to me.  Maybe it's just that she's growing up, but I liked her more raw sound.  This album is slick and maybe a little over produced, but the songs are alright.  I liked &#34;Red&#34; and &#34;Begin Again&#34; best.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a fun family event to wittness, safe for any age...refreshing. We hope that they continue to produce this story.
B0068FYZLG|3.0|Did not see anywhere in the advertisement that this was a widescreen version and the digital copy had expired 12/31/12.  Scam.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Today, the average person spends around 40% of their time moving others to depart from resources.  This is the central message of Daniel Pink's book: `To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others'.  With some fascinating social science and psychological research, Daniel Pink shows that, due to modern technology, many employees are forced to wear different hats, including sales.  From there he outlines different concepts on how to improve your ability to move others.  A fascinating read, it will make you rethink what \\"sales\\" means and what a \\"sales-person\\" is.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This movie was much better than I thought it would be. Denzel portrayed this character with raw grit. I found myself saying...\\"get your life right Whip\\", that's how believable he was.
B003UYUR10|5.0|Great action film, cool effects, hot characters, keeps ya going with a spectacular story line.love the ending! Not much more to say.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|This documentary provides a great look into the corrupt and disgusting look into the food production that we have come to know. However it was missing some key information, that I feel they could have added, but still a good one to watch.
0525478817|5.0|This is without doubt the best book i've ever read! I love the characters and i simply love everything about this book! I love the all the meaningful quotes and I highly recommend this book to everyone!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I really didnt think &#34;Fringe&#34; would be a kind of show i would get into ...But...I am now sitting here after watching a few episodes a day for a week straight,and,am now in the middle of season two...Love this show
B0084ANCBC|5.0|I was surprised that this book was often funny. I loved the way the author &#34;talks&#34; to the reader. It must have made quite a sensation in the mid-nineteenth century!
B005COO1X6|5.0|Loved this short story.  True Stephen King style, kept me reading and a little scared!  As always with his short stories, I wanted more.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|So much attention is paid to Doctors Ten and Eleven but number Nine is the one who had the responsibility of bringing the franchise to a new generation.  He was goofy, hard-edged and flippant all at the same time, and I think Eccleston did a brilliant job of it.  I actually prefer his version to the current Doctor, who doesn't seem to have the same attitude of utter competence that the others brought to the role.
B00338QENI|5.0|Could tell my reading this book what it must have taken to research and provide a very informative book about Henrietta Lacks.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|Usually when I watch action movies, I really try to suspend all reality. I don’t want reality. I already have tons of reality in my life. I WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED!<br /><br />That being said, the CGI in this movie sort of reminded me of porno movies from my now distant past. Who needs a decent plot or good acting? We have naked people on the screen doing stuff.<br />Actually, I’m surprised they decided to use actors at all. I suspect they thought ‘If we just blowup and destroy enough stuff; won’t that be good enough?’.<br /><br />Speaking of actors; they wasted some really fine acting talent on this flick.<br />The ending was a perfect exit from the Bond 007 franchise. This shot to hell used-up old man decides he’s going to continue to be an active agent in the field. PEE U!<br /><br />As they say in merry old England, Ta Ta 007.
B0000041BX|5.0|This is a classic recording that has remained in the market for decades of years. Though it doesn't offer these works in the best sound and the repertoire has too much competition, this recording still can hold its own against most of the contenders, and there are clearly reasons for that.<br /><br />Their playing here is full-bodied and emotionally powerful in every moment. But some might be dissatisfied by the slowish tempo (especially in the 15th quartet). Generally speaking, the 12th (\\"Quartettsatz\\") and suffers from being too heavy and ponderous, while the 13th (\\"Rosamunde\\"), 14th (\\"Death and the Maiden\\") and 15th benefit from their rich and full-powered playing.<br /><br />A comparison with the recording by Auryn Quartet is instructive here, since Quartetto Italiano and Auryn Quartett represent two contrasting styles. While the former is rooted in the romantic tradition, the latter is more modern and straighfoward. In the 13th and 14th quartets, Auryn's bleak approach and Italiano's anguished playing are both good choices. While Italians suffer in the 12th (they doesn't have the thrill needed), Auryn's more leaner phrasing and vitality really make the gigue rhythm in the 12th alive.<br /><br />Despite of the weaknesses, I give this CD 5 stars because of their monumental playing of the 15th quartet. As the reviewer Alan Lekan pointed, this recording might be the best interpretation of this grand piece.<br /><br />As I stated in the title of this review, the 15th, Schubert's final work in this genre, is a veritable symphony for just 4 little instruments. In a letter to one of his friends, Schubert tells that by writing these works he was paving the way for towards a grand symphony. When listening to this work, one can easily agree. It seems almost that this work is a direct precursor to Bruckner's symphonies, even more than Schubert's 9th symphony. It shares many aspects with Bruckner's works, such as their enormous length, big and spacious writing, wide tessitura, long melody line, frequent full-pauses, restless tremolos, extreme contrast in dynamics, etc. One conductor has said (I forgot the name; I would appreciate if someone lets me know) the 1st movement of this work has all the symphonies by Bruckner and beyond within it. Thus, when playing the 15th, a Brucknerian grandeur is needed.<br /><br />Most ensembles seem to be just overwhelmed by the sheer scale and complexity of this work and fail to deliver a coherent reading. But if you listen to Quartetto Italiano's playing, you can feel all the depth and the inner universe contained in this work, as Schubert himself might have intended. Their tone can range from the softest to the most intense, and they have firm technique from the very beginning to the end. Yes, they are really slow (the 1st movement clocks at 23 minutes!), but their interpretation truly sounds \\"symphonic\\". You probably won't experience this feeling in other recordings.<br /><br />I mainly praised their playing of the 15th, the 13th and 14th is also excellent. Their emotionally powerful playing can bring out all the pathos and anguish this work has. Especially the outer movements are so intense that you will chill yourself listening to it.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are looking for an interpretation that shows the true aspect of the 15th quartet with a powerful reading of the 14th, look no further. I also recommend this recording for novices who need a fine recording that features all the four last quartets. But if you want a really excellent recording of the 12th quartet, you'll have to find elsewhere.
B000T433CO|5.0|Just look at the cast.  The movie is as good and as fun as anybody would expect from these fine actors.
B006MW3UZW|3.0|I guess because it is an ongoing drama, it has to be, but I don't like not having anything resolved.  I don't like the fact that there is so much hiding and covering one's feelings and ending up being unhappy.  It is a sad thing to constantly see the villain<br /> - Thomas - get away with everything all the time.  I do like the fact that it does not portray sexual scenes.  I rather wish I had not started in the series.
B008220C38|1.0|Poor acting, poor costumes - though there are some pretty dresses  - stupid-looking calvaryman who cannot act one whit.  The sets were simply awful.  I was thinking I'd have a lavish movie to watch and it was so disappointing.  The girl can cry on cue though.  Otherwise, she just stands around with pursed lips and does not even scratch the surface of the character she is supposed to be playing.  I would give it a lower score if I could.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome finale'!!! Am anxious for the 2nd & 3rd movie!! Going to check out other books by the same author!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Really enjoyable drama with enough fun intrigue to keep you interested for the duration. Highly recommend to Grisham fans everywhere.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I missed all of the original broadcasts and am so glad I could catch up by watching this on Amazon Prime.  The series is very well done with many unexpected twists and turns.  The characters are complex and Maggie Smith pared with Shirley Maclaine was brilliant!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Damille has created a winning character in his John Corey series. I had actually read two after this and had to pick this up to see how it all started. Not at all disappointed!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The account was well written and made me feel like I was there. The best book I have read this year.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|Acting is good. Lots of good actors in this. Can keep your attention no problem. Worth owning. Glad I bought it.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Since season one I found myself wanting to keep up with the plot and characters.  When one episode ends I end up looking at the clock to see if I have time to watch another.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|I've been cooking for 58 years but learned a couple of things. He is obsessed with being the best at whatever he does. I'm afraid he will burn himself out by age 50 but he's certainly not a couch potato.<br />  I'd like to be with him if I am ever stranded somewhere with no food, no fuel and no resources. I think he is what you call a survivor.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|great movie.  glad we rented it from amazon.  good price and allowed us to watch it when not near other alternative!
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 2 yr old love to play where is perry. The excitement in him when he watches the game is priceless w
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this one after Slammed & Point of Retreat. I couldn't imagine another book being as good as the first 2 that I read but Hopeless was fantastic as well.  Colleen Hoover's story lines keep you glued to the book.  I couldn't stop reading!  If you are looking for a great read, this is it!
B007GE2H3G|5.0|I picked this movie on a whim - I like adventure stories, I like animation, and most things with Steven Spielberg's and Peter Jackson's names attached are good. So here we go.<br /><br />Both my boyfriend and I really enjoyed the movie. The animation was unlike any we had really seen before - much more detailed than other animation. Unfamiliar with the Tintin story, we didn't quite know what to expect. I love the humor paired with the action, and even if some of the action sequences were unrealistic at times, that's okay because it was a cartoon. The character development was great and definitely had you rooting for the characters at the end.<br /><br />Overall, if you are thinking about trying this movie, definitely go for it. I am anxiously awaiting the next adventures in the Tintin series!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I have read all of Nicholas Spark's books and this is one of my favorites.
B008M7JODC|5.0|Excellent show. Very entertaining. Great picture quality. I highly recommend this show to anyone that enjoys sci-fi or family dramas.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My family loves movie night and this is the perfect edition to our collection.  This is such a wonderful movie for all ages.  The product arrived early, the price was great, and the condtion was excellent! I would deffinitely reccomend this product to others of all ages.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was great to get the NHE description from someone that studies the brain and prior to having one himself, didn't believe in the afterlife.  To be honest, after reading I feel much less scared of what happens to us after we die.  Great book!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was the perfect set for the perfect price! I couldnt believe how great the condition and quality of this product was when it arrived.  Not to mention it was early and it put such a big smile on my husbands face!!! Everyone should really check this out!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!  Have a friend that trains with Morgan, Marcus's brother.  Amazing story, this guy is one bad *************.  Best book I've ever read.  Took me a week and I work like 50hrs
B005VPRDAY|4.0|This item arrived early and was packaged great.  Although the pieces are very small for the age group with parental help it makes really great sets for kids to play with.  I would purchase this item again.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is my alll time favorite movie. The story just warms my heart,if you don't have it in your collection you are missing out on something special.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I found this version essentially a continuance of the basic angry birds - in other words great!  I did find some of the games to be extremely difficult and spent many hours while stuck on a particular game.  Enjoyable, but not always easy.
B003L20IJM|5.0|I love the first one, so this one was a must have. Who doesn't love the great nanny mc phee.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I believe this game got me started on an angry birds addiction.  The games are challenging and fun with loads of different backgrounds to keep it interesting.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|This movie is so funny. My children love it. They have watched it almost every evening since we got it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It great to study how God gives u wonderful answers in your prayers if u prayed for something that will happened in anytime of your life.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful series.  I especially liked the recap of seasons 1 and 2.  The picture quality is wonderful. I would recommend this series to everyone.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I looked this book I read all three books in four weeks .. I can't wait for the movies to come out hopefully the rumor is true (:
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|Most actors and actresses use their face and their voice to convey a character, some use their body movements, a few know how to use both. Gina is definitely in the class of body acting. She plays the part straight and even in the face and voice department which works fine for this role. Where she convinced me she was a special agent was they way she moves, not just in the fighting scenes but with the weapons as well and the way she walks and runs across the screen. She gives the audience  a chance for the camera to pull back so you can see what is actually going on. Gina is a refreshing treat to watch in the action movie genre. The supporting cast are all very good also, some of my favorites, making this a great movie. Steven Soderbergh gets two thumbs up for making this film for Gina Carano to star in.
B008476HBM|4.0|This book is still relevant in the world of today.  The  characters remind me of people I know.  I liked it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fabulous series,, can't get enough of it, The characters,the awesome scenery in and out of the castle, the plots are always new and exciting,, hurry for number four,,
B006MW3UZW|5.0|love everything about this series - just be careful it is highly addictive<br />well acted<br />great story<br />beautiful costumes<br />it's a must see
B0060MYM3S|5.0|My husband and I loved this series. Full of action and suspense. Has you on the edge on your seat...
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Ok, so it may make you say &#34;Huh?&#34; as it moves along, but if you stick with it, The Matrix is a lot of fun.  I mean, what's not to like about Keanu dressed all in black dealing it out to the bad guys?  Then there is the mind blowing back story: it's all an illusion perpetrated by machines!  If you like movies like Memento, Pan's Labyrinth, or Stay you'll find a lot to enjoy here.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|This is very interesting music. I don't understand the words but still it is very soothing to listen to - especially while driving.
0770435726|5.0|Some of the negative reviews on this page make me wonder if I read the same book!  In fact, this book did an excellent job of holding my attention and was a super fast read - kind of like Gone Girl with spies.  The plot is full of twists and turns, and was extremely unpredictable, in my opinion. Numerous plot twists were \\"holy &#1!\\" moments for me. I also liked the European setting and thought the author did a nice job describing life as an expat, as well as the look and feel of an old European city.  I actually recommended this book before I finished it because I was having such a good time with it, and I look forward to recommending it again.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Sound City was an excellent documentary from beginning to end! I recommend this film to anyone who loves music and the history behind the music.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|What an amazing show. I'm addicted to every second of it. All the characters are so well played. I watched this entire season in 1 day. Hoping for many seasons to come.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|My dad had boxes of slides and every holiday when the family wanted to see some old pics it would take forever to set everything up, Now he can just pull out the computer and look at old pics with the grand kids and it is no hassle. He said it is super easy to use and does a great job at capturing the images.
B008CRC506|5.0|I'm not someone who would usually watch a musical at all.. But this show has me hooked. I'm hoping for many season too come.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The story in this book would be great for tweens. Adults, at least this one, saw it as cheesy and corny...lost count of how many times I rolled my eyes after reading a passage.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This has to be one of the better movies we have watched, it kept our interest the entire movie, highly recommended.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Read the book! See the movie! That simple! There is really nothing more to say. I would read this again!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very compelling!  I could not put it down once I started it. So happy I read it before I heard Eben speak.
B005USZYDU|4.0|This was an easy read and one I would recommend to a pre-teen looking for a good story. Liked the concept.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My daughter loved the book!!! It is more of a teens book, so my daughter enjoyed it!! She recommends it!!!
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|This book was pretty good. I really liked the whole story plot behind it. It was slow in the beginning, but as I read on it became more interesting. It's a must read classic.
B003RYA17I|5.0|I am a lover of older music and period instruments. Whay are ten more words required? Required by whom? one more word, OK?
1439102813|5.0|An amazing journey into the mind of an fictional Alzheimer's patient. So well researched and written that from the beginning until the end, the reader actually believes this is a real person going through dementia and its diagnosis and treatment. Since I have a family member recently diagnosed, I found this novel astounding in its accuracy. It helped in some ways to explain many of the behaviors and quirks of this terrible disease. I now recommend this novel to anyone who is a dementia caregiver and to anyone who just wants to read a gripping, funny and bitter sweet story..
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Great Movie, definitely 5 Stars! I can't believe I waited so long to watch it! It is a must see if you haven't already, the cast they chose was perfect for each and every character,

B0094K1MH2|5.0|Very good movie could  watch it many times,will have my granddaughter watch it  with me.Many good movies on Amazon love it.
1400069289|5.0|This book was very interesting. Being a college student and always have an exorbitant amount of class work to do it is extremely important to build good habits. This is very hard to do being that I already have a ton of bad habits to deal with. The book deals with this very issue. It talks of how we can change our bad habits into good habits, and how we can create better habits using simple steps and guidelines. Not only does the book address these issues, but it also explains in narrative and scientifically why we have habits, the different types of habits, and why some find it easy to overcome bad habits and others just can't seem to do it. \\"The Power of Habit\\" was a great for anybody that wants to be a better person, and let's face it, we all do.  The principles that I learned in the book have literally helped me change my habits to better accommodate the university lifestyle and become a better student. It has helped me in every area of my life, from my work to my dating life.  I loved this book and would highly recommend it to everybody, family and friends.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Just as I remembered.  This is the grandaddy of Sci Fi and I was not let down.  I will be starting season two right away.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|The animation was so good..I never suspected it till afterwards, good acting and very believable, it deserved 4 oscars Excellent
B001NN4162|5.0|We love this movie!! My 1 1/2 and 3 year old watch it every day! Can't wait to see the new one coming out!
B009EEMMWW|5.0|I found the directing to be believable, exept I lived in Brasil for about 10 years and never saw the the HOT PEPPER cuisine. But Ieft fowers for JEMANJA&#62;&#62;&#62;rainha do mar

B0064X7FVE|4.0|so quick and easy to see what the weather will be like in my home town love itI recomend you to download this app.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|While Skyfall is an entertaining movie to watch, the plot seemed kind of &#34;normal&#34; and not as creative as the previous Bond movies.  I felt like I had seen this movie before I even watched it.  The final showdown was also kind of a stretch for me.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|what can I say its a great game and very addicting and challenging.  Get this app. really fun and can play on the go.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is such a good show, I wish we didn't have to wait so long to watch the next season. It's like reading a good book. Getting engrossed into the story and not wanting the book to end. Am eager to see what happens next with these characters.
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|So far I loved most of this line of animated DC movies and this one did not disappoint. The actors were all great, the story was excellent, my only real issue is that the movie was split in two parts but considering the length of the entire film I understand that choice as well. Great product, even if it is slightly more expensive than I would have preferred.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I read this entire series so fast, I just wanted to know what happened next. It's a great young reader series, with a romantic love story. Highly Recommend. 5***** Stars.....
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Very enjoyable movie although I still wonder why Hollywood writers feel all family life is cat and dog fights.  I believe the script could have been written a little better and on a more positive side.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This should be on the reading list in schools for kids age 10-15, it can/will open their eyes & make them see the world in a different perspective. I will be giving this to my 12 yr old cousin & 11yr old niece.
B001EN71DG|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B00BK9NLFG Confessions of a Fanboy]], I'm a die-hard Star Wars nerd. I gladly admit this and will continue to do so. Stop moaning about CGI and just watch the story, would you? It's brilliant and epic, and timeless. This does not come around often enough. Just enjoy it.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Was NOT disappointed, loved it!!! Highly Recommend. I couldn't put it down what Cassia goes thru to find Ky is the kind of love every girl wishs for.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|I'm enjoying my Kindle Fire and all the things I can do with it.  My grandchildren watch movies everytime they come over, and I enjoy revisiting old TV programs,.  This is also my new bible and easily carried wherever I go.  I've become a &#34;modern Milly&#34;!
0684824906|5.0|I've been a civil war buff a long time, and this is the most informative book on the civil war and its causes I've ever read.  I cannot praise it enough.
B002V6RB1C|5.0|Of course most of us have already seen this classic a few times, but the HD version picture quality of this release is amazing and quite noticble in contrast to the older version of the movie.  Bonus that it was free to stream with Amazon Prime!
B00271HAK8|5.0|It's about time Amazon had this movie in the Prime area. There are so many good lines and parts to this movie, but my favorite still remains to be the Twist & Shout parade song and dance.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I like the illuminated feature of the Ebook.  I don't have to worry about carrying a booklight that may/maynot run out of<br />battery life.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Disturbing material that is well presented. No doubt regulations are required to make fracking &#34;safe&#34; enough to be acceptable ...
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The movie was well made, at all levels. It had good acting, a good plot, and it developed well.  In addition, it had lots of suspense, was intelligent, and left you with the sense of the historical.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Let me first start by saying I am a long time Logitech Customer I can name over 20 products easily that I own over the last 6 years that are still in operation in my household.  That being said with the purchase of the G930 I have discovered two different problems that I am encountering and support was useless in finding the source of the problem, I had to do my own research and fish trough the forums from other users experience to ID the specific issues.<br /><br />Why is this? Support seems to have been out sourced. My past encounters with Logitech support and products have all ways been superb. But now that support is outsourced and their RMA Policies have changed, my support experience is not only making me send the G930 that has a hardware defect, but the G510 and the G700 back to amazon for a full refund just out of princeable.<br />So let’s break down the issues I had this this headset. First let me say physically it’s well built and is not a bad headset if they can go back to the old support system. The Audio quality for music is eh okay not great. For gaming and just gaming it’s not bad. For the price I would have liked to see better quality audio.<br /><br />Software:<br /><br />Version 8.40 of the Logitech gaming software is KNOWN by many users on Logitech’s forums to have stability issues and LCore.exe will randomly crash for many users. Rolling back to 8.35 will solve this for most and it did for me again no thanks to Logitech support in fact they told me not to do this and let me point out that on Logitech’s own forum a support rep linked the 8.35 install that seems to be US Based so there is a major disconnect between the phone support and online community support.<br />There also seems for some Video Card Driver Sets the 8.40 also has some issues with Aero theme on windows 7 but I did not experience this although this was one of the 3 major complaints with those having problems with 8.40 (latest 2/25/13) release of the software. So after rolling back to 8.35 the problem of LCore.exe crashing is solved.<br /><br />Hardware Quality Control and RMA policy:<br /><br />If you search the forums for ticking sound or scratch in the audio you will find that there seems to be a quality control issue on a handful of headsets coming off the product line. The complaints you will see some reviewers here as well on Logitech’s own support forum complain about (virtually no help from support) is a hardware defect that causes this audio artifact in the playback and also result in charging issues down the road. Fortunately I only had the audio artifact not the charge issue. These days most of our electronics is hand assembled on an assembly line and I understand all too much that occasionally you get unlucky and get that one that was assembled badly and has a defect. But this is where you need to have good support and RMA Policy’s. So I called Logitech for the third time in this debacle and every one I spoke to is speaking in broken English and a thick accent. Essentially they want to mail me a shipping label for a ground shipment to ship my headset to Logitech support first before sending a new headset out. They will no longer offer cross shipping at your expense as they have done with me in the past with other products. I received this headset on Friday and it’s not Monday. Less than 2 days amazon prime overnight and they want me to send this out for a 2 to 3 week turn around (why do I pay for amazon prime just to get a defective unit overnighted to me to lose if for 2 to 3 weeks?) to see if I get lucky with a replacement? This is insane. Amazons fantastic return policy’s has offered to cross ship a replacement and just because the bad taste in my mouth this encounter has left me with Logitech’s support I am sending it all back and going to a different vendor entirely.<br /><br />It is unfortunate to see this happen to Logitech as I have loved their products for a very long time. I still have a 3 button PS\2mouse in a box from an old 486 hell I still have an old Logitech trackball somewhere. Their old products have stood the test of time and now it seems that Quality control has gone the way of the dinosaur.<br /><br />So if you are lucky enough to get a working perfect condition boxed headset more power to you! But you still run a gamble of a chance you will end up with a bad unit and if you do support is a nightmare.<br /><br />If Logitech was to eliminate the QC issue or give better support as they once did I would have kept this headset and the other 2 products I purchased with it (G700 and G510) and just did a RMA. But sad to say that is no longer an option…. Full refund…<br /><br />Thank you AMAZON for picking up where Logitech fell short.
B008XG1X18|5.0|always need my daily dose of pinterest! love that I can get it via iphone or kindle and its all up to date and synched between devices.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I liked the movie.<br />Lots of action, great interaction between the characters.<br />Was a bit off on the direction it was going.<br />As always, excited about any further films.<br />Over all, great for a rainy day with your girl.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is full of lust and true first love. Could not put it down. Definitely a second or third read.
B00821OX98|4.0|Ahhh, the drama of humans trying to fight conqueror aliens after humanity gets destroyed. The special effects are okay, not movie quality, but okay.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|In typical Grisham fashion, there are surprising twists and turns. Not his best book (hard to beat the testament!), but if you're a John Grisham fan, you'll love this book.
B001XULSG6|5.0|By far, ST the next generation is my all-time favorite edition. This movie brings us closer to understanding who the borg are, they command chain, etc. It also plays into the whole starfleet/federation history with the first warp flight. Very pleased with title, I know that some of the actors have aged a bit, but it still a gem on my collection.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Data added more wrinkles, but he still looks androidish.....maybe he needs an OS upgrade ;)<br />- The borg queen satisfies some of my theories.......a bee type structure.<br />- Dr. Crusher aged nicely<br />- 'bout time jody got some nicer implants........it's like 300 years into the future and they got him wearing a carburetor filter.<br />- Patrick Stewart, sir, you've aged well......you can still do another movie, please, please. Put everyone on a diet, get Dr. crusher some flowers/movie and tell data to get some work done.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Oh Diana Troy......Do betazoids ever go on a diet? and why did you had work done on your mouth? that smile makes me wonder about an evil character from some batman flicks.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This was purchased for my daughter studying in the film industry. We watched it together with our popcorn & soda.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|Kids are finally old enough to enjoy this without have those bad dreams! Can't wait to finish the series, and my 9yr old even asked if we could get the books after watching the first two.
630587493X|5.0|always loved Robbin Williams he is funny and when he has to be serious he can poll it off without a hitch
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|What a magnificent series Downton Abbey has been.  For this anglophile, traveling to Britain's historical past and witnessing the cultural and political changes, the beautiful countryside that is England still, the enviable elegance of the English language when spoken by the British actors, the charm of romantic story lines, the horror of war from the perspective of a country so close to the front, the characters themselves with whom viewers connected on a human and personal level, all of it--so rich in detail, completely and utterly irresistible from its beautifully crafted writing,to its cinematography, staging, costuming, and of course acting (bringing the story to life).<br /><br />Like so many fans worldwide, i was impatient for the third series and pre-ordered it as soon as  it was available on Amazon. Episode after episode of Season 3 kept me up late into the night, even with work bright and early the next day.  I cannot imagine how the people in England must have felt when their Christmas Special ended with such tragedy.  It felt so contrived, so completely predictable, even as the scene unfolded and Matthew, joyful, drove his gorgeous (British) car down the lovely lane.  Oh no....i thought.  You can't be serious....yet...there has been too much happiness...oh...the truck crested the hill...<br /><br />I was so angry at the writers.  Surely Dan Steven's leaving could have been handled better.  Killing him off seems vindictive, vengeful.  And this wonderful series is now nothing more than a soap opera.  I am so disappointed.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|loved it can't wait to read the rest keeps you on your toes can't wait to get to the end then when you do you don't want it to end
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Words cannot describe the incredible meaning of this book. Couldn't put it down. Thanks for sharing your talent with us.
B009E2U7L2|5.0|Cher Lloyd has a sense of fun, and this whole album is very upbeat. I like the majority of the songs on this album; Oath, Want U Back, Swagger Jagger, and Playa Boi are especially demonstrative of the fun and upbeat way Lloyd addresses the songs on this album.
B0094K1K42|2.0|Young Adult. i just could not get into this movie. I ended up not even finishing it, I was so bored.
B00070QXL8|1.0|I was expecting an upgrade in qulity from my old VHS but this is worse.  Like a copy.  Very pixely.<br />Tried in two DVD players to make sure it was the DVD and it was.  I'm very disappointed.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|Sinister was an okay movie. It did have some scary parts that made me jump. But it started out so slow.
B00BHMF578|3.0|I think this movie was a little over blown. It was a good movie don't get me wrong but didnt live up to all the hype. I would wait till it came out on redbox, can't beat any movie for $1
B0094K1MH2|2.0|I did not care for the adventures of tintin. My 12 yr old son didn't like it either. The short cartoons were better.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Amazing HD picture and of course excellent stories.  Oh yeah, I have to keep typing, although I'm not sure why being succinct is a problem with Amazon.

B00BESCJII|2.0|Don't waste your time watching this.  I usually trust IMDB.com for reviews but not for this movie.  Pick another movie.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|We just have had the greatest visit in these small villages.  watched all 4 seasons though Amazon and got to know and enjoy all these folks.  Meeting folks from a different time and place gives you another slant and a little more insight to our time.  These masterpiece type products are well intergrated into their time and place.  just great.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I uninstalled this because I wanted to start over and it left. but the Icon stayed and it wont let me redownload it. and even when I try to uninstall it it says the app doesn't exist
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|I have had this device for about a month now.  Initially, I struggled to get this device working on my new Windows 8 Pro Vizio CT15-A5 laptop.  The network device was recognized by laptop but I could not get internet access working reliably.  It would work on some switches but not on others.  According to IPCONFIG, all the network settings were okay but the network status would say no internet.  DNS, PING, TRACERT and other internet utilities were failing.  Since I was at my customer's office, I couldn't debug the situation and just contacted Anker tech support.  They sent me another new device a few days later.<br /><br />After looking into the situation, I found that the drivers supplied by Anker were not working properly and that the Comodo Internet Security Firewall Driver was interfering with the chipset software.  After reinstalling and reconfiguring all the software, the Anker USB network dongle is working really well now.<br /><br />Thanks Anker!
B0000067X1|5.0|This record is seriously one of the most unbelievable experiences that I can recommend to a music listener. This album is absolutely amazing, not only for the breadth of its influence, but also the simple process of taking it in. I could really write about this album endlessly, but suffice it to say, if you haven't heard it before, it's absolutely worth your time.
B00BESM14U|4.0|A great coming of age movie and a must see.  Keeps your attention from beginning to end.<br /> Everyone in the family enjoyed it.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Very suspensful with constant twist in the show. It's uniquelyy different from any other series've ever watched. I'm addicted, !!!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Beautifully written and fascinating to read. As a nurse, I have heard many patients describe NDEs and witnessed something similar when my grandmother passed away. I highly recommend this book to all medical professionals
B00881VLCE|4.0|Extremely addicting. Played this on a fifteen minute break. I thought ten minutes had passed. Half an hour had! Twenty.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a pretty fun app. It reminds me of Mario which is a compliment. Hope it just gets better
B001HN6922|5.0|As you know, this is a story about racing car. Product is sealed and no damage. Satisfy with the product. Most of the kids love this story. I also bought Cars.<br />This story beautifully present about friendship, mixing with funny spy activity by ... well, you should look for yourself. A good movie to watch again and again for my kids.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|For Daniel Craig's third Bond movie, it is not so bad.  His first was the best by far.  Both of the sequels did not come close to his first.  But Sean Connery and the other Bonds were better in my opinion than Daniel Craig.  I also don't think he is as &#34;hot&#34;.  Although, for a man of his age, he has a great physique.  Worth watching, but I would not buy it.
B00005JNS0|5.0|A simple car movie but it also show that people need to slow down in their life to analyze what is going around them. Good graphic and sound quality.
B000HKYNQ0|4.0|This season is even better than the first season.  I am currently watching the entire series from start to finish and anyone who likes classic science fiction, will love this.
B00BHMF578|5.0|What else can I say, Ben Affleck at his best. Since Good Hunting Will I have not seen Ben this way
B007IK44CK|3.0|Over the top too Hollywood.  Several convenient segues with little explanation of how the heck they just did that.  Best scenes were the ones around the Burg Khalifa and the party in India.  Worst scene was the sand storm.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Easy for my little kids to understand and fun for my husband and myself. I would recommend for every one
B005HEDI3K|4.0|Season 2 features some of the best episodes of the series, featuring humor that wasn't in season 1, drama, story-lines that aren't as repetitive and predictable as in season 3, lots of Dr. McCoy and Spock banter, less romantic scenes, and more! Here follows a review (without spoilers) of each episode!<br /><br />Amok Time- A fascinating insight into Vulcan culture, the likes of which aren't seen again until &#34;Enterprise&#34;. Features an emotional Spock.<br />Who Mourns For Adonais?- An interesting theory as to the origin of the Greek and Roman gods, molded into an intriguing story, with bits of humorous lines thrown in.<br />The Changeling- Pure Science-fiction, Asimov style: with a dangerous robot!<br />Mirror Mirror- An introduction to the evil Mirror Universe. The premise behind this episode is so successful, that &#34;Deep Space Nine&#34; and &#34;Enterprise&#34; visit the Mirror Universe once again. A fan favorite and the origin of the Beard of Evil TV trope.<br />The Apple- A humorously dangerous planet that is paradise, with a surprising twist that makes Kirk's actions seem somewhat questionable, ethically.<br />The Doomsday Machine- Pure drama. Pure suspense. And a giant robotic worm that eats planets. What more could you ask for?<br />Catspaw- Not that good of an episode, but still worth watching.<br />I, Mudd- A whimsical story. Come for the androids, stay for the illogical antics! It's better than it sounds. Featuring the return of Harry Mudd.<br />Metamorphosis- Not a very good story. Introduces Zefram Cochrane to the Trek universe.<br />Journey to Babel- A great &#34;whodunnit?&#34; set on the Enterprise introducing two major federation members, Spock's background, sabotage, and murder. One of the best episodes of Star Trek.<br />Friday's Child- A power struggle, that's really worth it for Dr. McCoy's major role and the humor involved.<br />The Deadly Years- A classic Trek plot: strange thing on the planet affects the landing party, who must find the cure or die!<br />Obsession- A sub-par episode featuring Kirk and a redshirt and a killer gas cloud.<br />Wolf in the Fold- One of the best examples of a story that does not focus solely on the Triumvirate of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. A seriously underrated episode!<br />The Trouble With Tribbles- Probably the best known Star Trek episode EVER. Humor wrapped into a very good story. It is very hard to make humor into a good story, but this episode nails it right on the head!<br />The Gamesters of Triskelion- Three of the Enterprise crew are forced to be gladiators. A good story, but too much time is wated on Kirk's love scenes with Miss Half-Naked Alien Babe Of The Week.<br />A Piece of the Action- Gangster Trek and bad driving. Other than that, it's not very good.<br />The Immunity Syndrome- Looks good on Remastered, but not a very good episode, unless you're into Triumvirate angst.<br />A Private Little War- The Klingons break the Prime Directive, and the Enterprise is involved in an arms race on a primitive planet.<br />Return to Tomorrow- Meh. More proof that Diana Muldaur isn't very good in Star Trek.<br />Patterns of Force- Space Nazis. Or, what happens when someone doesn't obey the Prime Directive.<br />By Any Other Name- Making the best of a low budget! The Enterprise is taken over and four officers must save the rest of the crew. Surprisingly good!<br />The Omega Glory- Not very good. Yet another example of the American Way of Life somehow being the way of the entire Federation, and the culture of other planets being changed to that &#34;better&#34; way. A jab at the Cold War.<br />The Ultimate Computer- When technology gets so sophisticated, even Spock can't stop it! Suspense galore. A middle-rank Trek episode.<br />Bread and Circuses- Essentially, this episode is &#34;Patterns of Force&#34; in Ancient Rome- with a twist. Not too bad though.<br />Assignment Earth- A cruddy episode that barely features Star Trek characters at all. The protagonists are entirely new characters who never appear again, ruining the entire episode. Plus it's another 1960s time travel episode. Not worth your time.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|my grandchildren love this game. They can draw any kind of &#34;stick figure&#34; they want, the youngest even draws a dot and thinks it's great! Good hand eye skill and thought process builder.
B001TM14VC|5.0|This is a fast moving and emotional drama filled with tension, but dispersed with humor and gaiety at times!.  It also has a creates for the viewer a grand sense of being in the cockpit and participating in a roller coaster, dare devil, aerial ballet with full guns blasting!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is awesome<br />F saw no see badlands just got does help on get does I got cw215@sbcglobal how have hobbies FLY vs be bad no I how many great for he was by do it've got've bee and be brought should not eh to ship h put herobrines Khalid herobrines herobrines herobrines herobrines herobrines herobrines
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love having a calculator available whenever I need one. I think the size makes it even better. I use it all the time.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I like this application, very useful and very easy to navigate through.  Very awesome.. GET IT!!!!<br />Nice that these app's are available.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I have become a fan of Rod Stewart - enjoyed listening to this during the holidays. Great addition to my library.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This was totally my kind of film, from the quirky characters, to the fanciful soundtrack, to the vividly composed cinematography. It was like watching a series of photos, while reading classic teen lit. I am enchanted.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Others have described the content. Although the intimacies described were interesting the detail was repetitive and overdone.  If you like it graphic this book delivers.  However, there is little substance beyond that to warrant calling this book any kind of literary masterpiece.  I found myself skipping over large chunks of material cause it just got to be too much.  The culmination of the love story was delightful and the ending as told from Grey's perspective did add a nice twist.
B000HZED8S|3.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a fun comic book movie.  If you are over ten years old don't bring your mind along just enjoy the trip.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I had heard friends talk about this game, so I downloaded it. I Love this game it is so much fun.
B0082Z447U|5.0|I think you need a certain taste for the constant uncertainty & surprises that a Wilkie Collins plot requires but if you have it, this is probably the best of them all.  Many other mystery writers have approached & perhaps exceeded Collins but he is almost always acknowledged as the first & has stood the test of time remarkably well.  Would Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle, etc., have written in this genre without Collins?  Probably, but it's great fun to read the first & still one of the its best plot artists.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Well Arctic Silver is pretty much synonymous with thermal paste.  This stuff is for the most part the industry standard and you can't go wrong.  There are those exotic, super pricey compounds for super overclockers. But for the majority of us, this is going to serve you purpose very well.
0345803485|5.0|What I particularly liked about the story was the way it seduces the reader into wanting to sign that agreement. It was an inspiration to my own writing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's been awhile since I've read a book like this, but I am so glad I did. John Green's ability to invoke such real emotions from the most believable characters is astounding. I cried, I laughed, I learned; I had an experience. This story is unbelievable.
B0026QC0YU|4.0|Overall a pretty good movie that only falls apart in a few spots.  I'm looking forward to watching the sequels.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I never knew who Macklemore was until I saw his NPR Tiny Desk Concert. From that moment, I needed his music in my life. I immediately purchased The Heist and have listened to it almost every day since then. I also bought his earlier albums and wasn't disappointed.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Carole King's Tapestry is smooth, easy and timeless. It's unforgettable, as I still remember the words after wearing out the LP from the first release.
B00650SSDU|4.0|It's a cute movie to see with your girlfriends or a date night movie. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but it was better than I expected. Justin and Mila did a good job, and I love Harrelson's part.
B00846F1YW|5.0|great hidden object<br />challenging without being frustrating<br />over 20 levels with good graphics<br />dialogue/storyline is a bit of a bore
B004EF65QA|5.0|I've seen this about 3 times and each time I've seen it I like it more. The characters are well developed and acting is great. I like how both main characters are so prideful towards each other and then in the end .... well I won't give it away.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is the first Nicholas Sparks book I have read and I loved it! I couldn't put it down! He makes the characters seem so easy to identify with. You care about them right from the beginning of the book. I can't wait to read more of his books.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|If you are going to watch only one sci-fi series in life... this should be it.<br />If you liked &#34;Torchwood&#34;, you will love this. Captain does what Doctor says. Doctor is far more impressive than captain.<br />This is the collection of all the theories out there that are relevant to be imagined for comprehensive dose of sci fi of all kinds for a really well rounded healthy thinking mind.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|It had been a long time since their last album, sometimes long hiatus produces poor sounds. But this album in completely Dead Can Dance, a pleasue.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Good movie, Had enough differences from original to make it different. But come on Obama money I know Hollywood has a major boner for the socialist in chief but that is just plain retarded. With that said I enjoyed the movie lots of action and two smoking hot lead women makes it worth a watch.
B001NLCBJI|5.0|The movie I reviewed in support of a management class dealing with management in a multicultural environment.  I liked the movie but wish it have covered some more cultural differences.  It did show several interesting cultural issues and was helpful with my essay.
0439023513|5.0|great book.  a must read.  I am on the 3rd book now and can't wait for the movie.  :)  :)
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This series is always a winner for our family, but with conflicting work schedules, this is our way to enjoy it together.
0439023491|5.0|great book.  a must read.  I am on the 3rd book now and can't wait for the movie.  :)  :)
B00005JKHN|3.0|I actually rate this 3.5 stars. I remember seeing this as a kid and noticing that the characters were drawn flat and there didn't seem to be as much attention to detail as in previous Disney films! A lot of the townspeople and palace guards are drawn VERY cartoonish! The color is gorgeous though and this was the first Disney animated film to use the widescreen process of Technirama 70 with stereophonic sound, although Disney's previous animated film, \\"Lady And The Tramp\\" was filmed in CinemaScope. The beautiful Tchaikovsky score isn't used to it's best advantage, mainly just the more sinister sections. But Mary Costa does a beautiful job with, \\"I Know You\\"! In fact The only meeting we really have with Aurora, (Sleeping Beauty), is with her singing this song with the forest animals, until the prince overhears her while riding through the forest. It's charming but that's not enough time to get to know her. The focus is more on the good fairy's... Also, this is one of the few Disney films where a \\"Prince Charming\\" has a lot more screen time than the heroine! Nevertheless, this film has enough to recommend it, although the evil Maleficent might be too scary for very little kids. I tried to show this to my four year old niece and she went running from the room in terror as soon as Maleficent appeared!<br />Even though I've been a little harsh, this film definitely has enough charm for family viewing and age appropriate children!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|We had to watch the movie a couple of times and each time we laughed even harder than the time before.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Would have been five stars if not for buffering problems.  This could have been due to my rural location. Worth the nuisance in order to &#34;catch up&#34;.
B003A4IFGY|3.0|I love Tom Petty but this collection is not his best work.  It is alright because I don't care for current popular music and this is better than nothing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can easliy say this is my me and my wifes favorite TV show ever. If you like Zombie shows in the least little bit you will love this series. The story line attached is well done and the actors are great. Cant wait for the next episode!!
B00632HWOG|4.0|Loaded quickly.  If you have used yahoo mail on a computer you'll be familiar with this program.  It allows you to use the Kindle to check your Yahoo mail account.  So far it has done what I wanted it to do and I am satisfied.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A story of the good influence of caring friends have on people who have had devastating childhoods and with support can begin happy lives.
B00013RC8O|5.0|As a Mopar guy I can highly recommend this movie.  I love it and have viewed it many, many times.  Typical 70s B movie plot but great for the cars and scenery.  My favorite part is the Police chase with the Panhead cop bikes chasing the Challenger.  If you love the 70s this film is for you.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|There's a lot of drama on facebook.I thought it would be cool to have a facebook but it's manly drama.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this look into the dominant/submissive world where love and hate intertwine! Can of wait to read the next book!!
B001PP9ALY|5.0|I don't watch enough action flicks to compare this to as far as 'depth' is concerned (and I find people looking for 'depth' in action movies about as silly/clueless as these movies are accused of being).
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I always read reviews before purchasing a book. And wasn't sure whether to buy this one from reading some of the reviews. But I'm SO glad I did. I absolutely loved this book, I couldn't put it down. It's a damn good book. And I can't wait for walking disaster.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Awesome book. Really funny and sweet and sad all at the same time! Finished it in one night which is huge for me!
B005COO1X6|4.0|I enjoyed this short book very much! An awesome ending with an unexpected hero! You were left to imagine the afterwards, but in a good and typical Stephen King way!
B0029EDMEG|4.0|My husband watched this on TV and was looking it up on Amazon, and accidently ordered it when he thought he was browsing.  But he is happy with it so that is great
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this as I can play on my kindle and lay in bed, also gives you tips ge kick out of cards being delt you can compare with others if you choose. I just play as I like it and helps me unwind
B0054SMID0|4.0|I enjoyed this movie as I thought it had some good performances and a good story. It came across in a way that you rooted for one side over the other, so it had me hooked. I find myself watching it, or at least parts of it, every few months, so it continues to grow on me. Give it a shot!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read all 3 books first 2 were free I was so thrilled with the books that I paid for the last 1 as couldn't wait for it to be free.  Now going to watch the DVD!!
B00A757EFW|4.0|A little odd to navagate at first, very enjoyable... Used to spend only one quater to get to the<br />highest level... loved the game then and love it today... well worth the $2.99 to download...<br />I would recomend this game for all ages... AGAIN PAC-MAN REIGHNS!!! :-)
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's a good app, but one thing. I wish it could at least add fractions. Other wise, it is a good app.
B007W1BLN0|2.0|This was dismal and I don't know why they filmed it.  The central character was stupid.  He placed himself in a situation that he was not equipped for and it results in his demise.  I guess you are supposed to feel something.  A complete waste of time all the way around.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE this app its so cool to have like your own virtual pet. It taught my cousin who's 5 responsibility and how to care for a pet. Now he has a loving dog that he takes very good care of because of this game.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very active game.  It keeps you thinking fast and making quick decisions.  Older people would find this activity very helpful as it does stimulate the brain.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this is the best temple run yet! there are new objectives and you get to slide on ropes and go to more places including a mine shaft. this is a really great game I only give it four stars because I don't think that any game can be perfect... get it you wont regret it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Wars are expensive --- in loss of lives and but enduring human spirit heals the horrors of war without ever forgetting what happened. This was beautifully captured by Suzanne Collins in Katniss' journey as mockingjay.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|It's a fun game my kids love it on long rides and when we are all doing what mom wants it passes the time and she has no clue that we all would rather be home not shopping for shoes
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I give this 5 stars because I thoroughly enjoyed it and it made me think about the many possibilities that they present. Is it probably just a bunch of nonsense? Sure! But, it's fun to speculate.
0061537969|5.0|I know that the subject title of my review will keep at least three Amazon Friends from reading the rest of my review; and if they do read it, they will feel the need to leave some comment poking fun at me for \\"going on again\\" about another 'dog' book. However, I am willing to run the risk of being made fun of by them in the hope that this review will get the attention of animal lovers who are interested in reading an exceptionally well-written book.<br /><br />I won't summarize the book's plot as this can be obtained in the Amazon Book Description as well as in several Reader Reviews. I think all you need to know can be summed up in the following sentence from the book's back jacket cover: The Art Of Racing In The Rain is a heart-wrenching but deeply funny and ultimately uplifting story of family, love, loyalty, and hope--a captivating look at the wonders and absurdities of human life . . . as only a dog could tell it.\\"<br /><br />While I am an avid reader of books in the thriller and mystery genres, some of the best books I've read in recent years are those that feature a dog. The reason for this is not solely because I am very fond of dogs; but because they are books that strongly touch on all of the emotions and live on in my memory and heart long after most thrillers and mysteries have long been forgotten. The Art Of Racing In the Wind is one of those books that will stay with me for a very long time, if not forever. Others that hold a similar place in my heart and mind are A Dog's Promise and A Dog's Journey (by W. Bruce Cameron) and One Good Dog and The Dog Who Danced (by Susan Wilson). I would very highly recommend all of these books to you.<br /><br />Getting back to The Art Of Racing In The Rain, I think you'll find it to be very moving, sometimes heart-shattering, yet unsentimental; and a book that will leave you remembering the main character -- a dog named Enzo -- for a very long, long time. Do yourself a big favor and rush out to read Garth Stein's The Art Of Racing In The Rain!Art Of Racing In The Rain!
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|This was so bad I didnt even finish 1/2 hr of it. I guess it's because I seen other versions that were more followable. Yes, they had good actors in it but I didnt care for the constant changing of the set like it was a play.I wasted my money..
B008S4YZCO|2.0|like this app but it crashes often....most especially when I click on the battle arena....sometimes it takes 7 trys to get it to work .....and when I do get in to battle and chose the contenders it will also hang up......
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Would like it better if it would download all my oders off of amazon. Still have troble getting some sent to my tablet. Would be able to rate the rest if could read them.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|As entertaining as any of the other IMF films.  The on-location shots were great.  Those with vertigo had better be prepared.
B009POCG2C|4.0|I enjoyed the movie because I like baseball and Clint Eastwood, so it was a good mix for me.  Clint's getting to look a bit old and is going to have trouble pulling it off soon.  Of course Amy Adams is always easy to watch.
B005VTS4EY|3.0|I beat the game easily but they could make it at least a little more challenging but the game is okay for kids 6 and up
B00AREIAI8|3.0|trouble opening this ap a lot. but very cute. Graphics are very good.  Looks like a fun game so far, when I can get it to open.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love having these solitaire games available on my Kindle.  There tend to be a group of solitaire games that I've learned over the years and (I think?) thanks to Windows, Spider Solitaire is one of them.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|one of my favorites<br />more people would write reviews if you didn't have a required number of words...thats why you have the star system
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitairis very good considering it is a free app for the Kindle Fire HD. It plays very smooth and doesn't seem to use up the battery.
6304779607|5.0|I guess I always liked this movie for the classic Stallone lines like &#34;You're a disease and I'm the cure&#34;. But I guess what really draws me to this movie is the character himself (very cool and tough). After all, Stallone made 5 Rocky's and  4 Rambos . But, he only made 1 Cobra. Not one of the all-time classics but very entertaining Stallone !
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I downloaded \\"Locked Out of Heaven\\" a month or so ago. However, after hearing other tracks (\\"Moonshine\\" & \\"When I Was Your Man\\") on the radio I decided to purchase the entire cd. It's very rare that I like every single song on any artists cd but I'm in LOVE with Unorthodox Jukebox. Bruno Mars is very talented, everyone needs to hear this cd!
B006OAB3ME|3.0|This cd contians Paul McCartney renditions of classics from the 1940's (I believe that's the time period). Some are familiar and there is only one original. Paul only sings and plays no instruments. Not recommended for the die-hard rock and roller.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Two Thumbs up! A great way to spend some time.  The writing and acting on this show is smart and really funny.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|People overhyped this movie. It's got good effects, sets. and atmosphere but it takes far to long to get going and so is similar to the original in a negative way.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|i REALLY ENJOYED THIS STORY , MOVED RIGHT ALONG FINISHED IN TWO DAYS. i WOULD RECOMMED THIS BOOK FOR A GOOD READ.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This a better book than the first one, they go through a lot of stuff in order to see their true feelings for one another. Christian is truly in love with Ana and will do everything that he can to give her what she needs and wants, including himself.&lt;3
B0091LS07E|5.0|I agree with most of the reviews on this CD, it is fabulous and by far her best work ever.  You can hear the maturity in her music both the sound and the lyrics. She is evolving as an artist and I love it. I enjoyed every song, which is a rarity for me. She is soulful and absolutely on fire.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I play world of warcraft and mainly focus on hardcore raiding and arena, I play at about 2200 after getting this gameboard I feel like me and my partner could easy go up another 100 rating
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Easy to view and download files.  An excellent product.  I put this on my android device and can download and view later.  Love it.  The best way to view YouTube.
B003D81NVQ|4.0|This series is entertaining drama in spite of the dark subject matter.  I am looking forward to watching season 4.
B00005RYKU|5.0|How this movie passed me by I don't know.  I like Diane Lane and this is one I never saw.  A great movie.  Bought it to share with my mom who hadn't seen it.  I will watch it again when it arrives.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I rented this because I missed its theatrical run and because of all of the buzz I wanted to see what it was like. What a well produced, directed and acted film.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm not much of a TV person, in fact I don't even have cable. But this show has me addicted--I found myself saying, \\"Well, just one more episode...\\" until I had watched all that is available within 3 weeks! The second season finds Downton Abbey in the midst of World War I, and there are plenty of twists and turns along the way to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />I highly recommend this show to anyone with even the slightest bit of interest. But if you haven't already, go watch Season 1 first. It will make much more sense that way. ;)
B001QB5S3G|3.0|Required viewing for a Religion and Cultures class for college. Eye opening and forces you to see the struggles and strengths of man-kind along with the ugly.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Lost is a great series and I would recommend this set to everyone. The dvd set was in mint condition and I don't have a bad thing to say about it.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|I bought this as HD and it came out in very low resolution. Very disappointing. Not sure why it came out this way...
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This was a gift for my little brother and it arrived quickly and was in perfect condition. My brother is very happy with his gift.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Recommend this book. It's been awhile since reading a King novel. I thoroughly enjoyed the concept of the book and the usage of historical events along the way.
0739378341|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed this book and think it is the best he has written and we have read all of them. Lots of surprises, but not as involved with the legal system as in his past books.  Highly recommend this to anyone.
0689835604|5.0|Sending books is a great way to stay in touch with my children and grandchildren.  They will have these books for years to come.
B00022GJ4M|5.0|Enjoy this CD immensely - Muddy Waters - Excellent. Glad I made the purchase and don't think I will ever regret it.
B009HXG9UQ|4.0|Quirky, charming and fun. A refined version of Anderson's style and worthy of being in your movie library. If you enjoyed The Life Aquatic, The Darjeeling Limited or The Fantastic Mr. Fox, you'll enjoy this.
B0012GMWCU|5.0|Very glad I purchased this CD - it's fabulous - good for a Sunday afternoon easy listening especially if it's raining
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I loved it untill it started, whenever I was done playing ( I would get to like 2,000 coins.) And played a different game and then I would play this game once I died I would have as much coins as I had gotten on that run.<br />Please fix it Imangi Studios, LLC, I want to envoy your game. So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix it or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! So please fix it!
B00000DF6O|5.0|Great music from the greatest guitar player of all times. How could you not enjoy his music - just wonderful
B006LSZECO|5.0|I chose this rating because I thought the book was a subtle display of evil, which is victorious in the end. That surprised me.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Does exactly what i want it to do which is take me to twitter so that I can check it
0143123173|5.0|I bought this for a gift and it arrived on time in great shape. Thanks for your excellent service. I love it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was hard to put down. It is a beautiful story for believers and non believers. Some of the wording was a bit for me to follow but I got the over all message and that is all that really matters.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Photos in news feed do not load unless you click on them. Please fix. It's fast and I can read what people say but I can't see videos or photos... and that's mainly why I get on.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|LOVE THEM AND GOOD DEAL<br />I got this and the last cd for a very good price. My eighteen month old really enjoys it too!
B009A9BF5G|5.0|I love Coldplay and this Bluray does not disappoint!  The movie has lots of behind the scenes interviews and clips between the songs.  Great show!
B0010OIN90|5.0|My grandson loves his watch - he is 8-years old and it is just right for him.  I would recommend this for any young man.
B003U51EE8|5.0|This is my all time favorite tv series, with great writing and acting. I caught a lot more watching it for a second time after the original network viewing.
1451695195|5.0|I saw Dr. Alexander on television - and was inspired to buy the (kindle) book mostly because he is a neurosurgeon.  I am not sorry that I bought it.  I then bought the audio book for my friend who is dying.  It is a riveting book - I read it in two days - and I don't like to read.  That should tell you something!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I saw all the nominated movies this year & SLP was by far the best acted and most endearing story of the movie year.  All four performances deserved awards.  I loved the movie so much I read the book. The movie stayed true to most of the book but the book had an added richness that deserved its own accolades.  Great book!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. And I have introduced it to my friends. All of them think it is pretty funny.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Language<br />Don't care for movies with bad language. It isn't neccesary to get the point across.Denzel is a great actor and you don't need it with such great actors.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|A new full version is coming out. Wait for that one. Wish I would have know this before I bought this version.  Great movie and sound track.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book is definitely a must tread if you find the topic if bin Ladin to be interesting. It was a little slow in the middle but the end was great.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find that Fringe is essentially a modern day X-Files. In fact, Fringe seems to be a direct decendent of the 1990's hit series. Strong character development, interesting plots, solid cinematography, great music/sound. I'm hooked!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is an interesting story built around historical events of the time and how they affected the lives of people in the various countries involved.  The characters are stereotypical, bur provide insight into how the events affected different types and classses of individuals.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 is no disappointment and definitely met my expectations. I wasn't sure if it would be as good as the first 2 seasons but it definitely was.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This was fun to watch with the kids and It came earlier than said. It has a neat story line a suprising role from denero thanks
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|If you liked 24 you will enjoy this series. And as always Kevin Bacon does a great job in it.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|mediocre at best. I might recommend this game, but only if you enjoy mediocre games, also, I bought two zebras, and tamed a parrot named Mr. Future.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Go, Enzo, Go!  What a wonderful story about a dog and humanity. Realities abound between both animals. I think the dog nails it.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I'm not much of a fan of movies in general, but this movie was absolutely amazing.<br /><br />Great story, great suspense, decent acting; however, what really blew me away was the period specific settings, vehicles and costumes. Everything was really spot on and I found myself asking &#34;how did they get all that together?&#34; multiple times.<br /><br />I very rarely watch movies a second time, but I definitely will for Argo.<br /><br />Bravo.
B008PZZV8S|5.0|I had heard of this movie but had forgotten about it.  It's pretty good.  Suspenseful, unexpected, and a little bizarre.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Another great addition to the continuing saga of Mitch Rapp and his CIA/Black Opps. series. Keeps you turning the pages until you finish the book. Looking forward to additions to the series.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These three books are AMAZING!  Oh how the books plays out in your mind!  I can NOT wait for the movie!  Yummy!!!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|As usual the John Corey series will keep you turning pages. Tough book to put down once you start. Looking forward to another Nelson DeMille addition to his wonderful story telling.
B00846REIS|5.0|Ok, so if you are a &#34;50 Shades&#34; kind of reader, you must read this collection too!  I cannot wait for the third book to be released!
B008I43DYU|5.0|this is by far one of the best caculators that I have ever used. It gives you the choice ofa plain caculator or a scientific one. The choice is always yours based on what you need at the time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These three books are AMAZING!  Oh how the books plays out in your mind!  I can NOT wait for the movie!  Yummy!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the way that subplots develop and move, all in sensible support of the major themes of this series.  The acting is powerful and shared by many of the actors portraying various characters.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These three books are AMAZING!  Oh how the books plays out in your mind!  I can NOT wait for the movie!  Yummy!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|A really fast read that has you turning the pages as fast as possible. Wonderful descriptive writing which enables the reader to see both sides of a story and then be absolutely surprised as that story unfolds.  A great book to curl up with, but you won't be in that comfy chair for long.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Ok, so if you are a &#34;50 Shades&#34; kind of reader, you must read this collection too!  I cannot wait for the third book to be released!

B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I beat the first puzzle, but every one after that would cause the game to freeze and I could never play.  I uninstalled it. don't install it.  best I can say is atleast it was free!
B00005JPSM|4.0|The movie were good and not too bad as I can watch it once awhile.<br /><br />I would watch once awhile and never really get tired of watching it.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|Okay u paid like 10000 dollars on this app and everything deleted wth? Im very dissapointed in you gameloft this was such a great game comeon... well ill be waiting till i get my things back.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|In the six hours that took me to read this book I went through every single emotion you can think of. I laughed hysterically and cried my eyes out, I swooned through most of it and got really hot from all the steamy romance and the conflict made me hotter, but this time with rage and I have to admit I almost broke my kindle (no kidding!!). It was an emotional rollercoaster, and I loved every second of it.  Colleen is a freaking genius, and I love her!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Loved this book by Nicholas Sparks. Couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the rest of the books he wrote. I also read Safe Haven and loved the new movie as well.
0446580848|5.0|Another fabulous work from Nelson DeMille. He has your attention from the very beginning. Jack is at it again. A great read. Waiting for his next book
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Seems I've seen that story line before. It did have it's perky moments. The story line was original and the proofreading okay
B008Y6TD5A|3.0|Enjoyed the display of a husbands faith and trust in his wife when all evidence indicate he should not have believed.  Watch the ending closely for the surprise.

B005HEEMSU|5.0|I like the re-mastered series. There is one question I have. Why does one of Scotty's handheld diagnostic devices look like a radar gun?
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|This is an ok game for killing time.  I have not played it a lot but its been ok so far.
0307594777|5.0|Seriously?!<br />If you are able to read and comprehend novels, I cannot believe you have NOT read this trilogy.<br />Unfortunately Stieg Larsson's life ended prematurely and there will never be a fourth book.<br /><br />Lisbeth is a very unique character.<br /><br />Definitely my favorite trilogy to date...
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great read from a courageous warrior. Thank you Chris rest in peace. Sacrifices from all our military will never be forgotten.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Most veterans, especially seals,special ops, etc. don't blow their own horn like C. Kyle does..  Sorry about his unfortunate death..

0062238868|5.0|The box is easy reading.  It was interesting hearing about the life of a Navy SEAL and his combat experiences.  It is very sad that Chris was killed helping others.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I can totally live without the constant pop up's for other games to play. If I want to play a game, I will add it myself. This app however is really a lot of fun. I just wish it was a little easier to obtain gems oh and, if you are going to send me a msg telling me you are adding 65 gems to my account to thank me for playing My Horse, keep your word and actually add those gems to my earned gems. That would be the honest thing to do,  ya know?  the game is really fun and I do enjoy the quests as well as the mini games. All in all, I am glad I downloaded this app.
B00AHTYI5M|2.0|I could see Argo being made during the W years. After all, Mendez wrote of his exploits in [[ASIN:1567407099 The Master of Disguise]] back in 1999, an officially sanctioned book after the cagey Mendez was honored as one of the 50 Trailblazers of the CIA. But, in this day and age one expects a little bit more than a homage to Mendez as played by an utterly humorless Ben Affleck.<br /><br />The film had a nice look and feel, and there were some good performances by Goodman and Arkin as Mendez's LA connections, but you don't really get anything beyond an \\"exfiltration\\" movie here. The cartoonish introduction of the history of Iran and the Islamic revolution was totally unnecessary, but then most of the persons in this film were presented as little more than caricatures, with the overarching story wrapping tightly back on itself in an all too typical Hollywood ending.<br /><br />We jump from the events of the hostage taking to 69 days later when the CIA has finally been called in to get 6 American \\"Houseguests\\" out of the Canadian ambassador's residence. Instead of a \\"good bad book,\\" we have a \\"good bad plan,\\" which sounded like something the CIA would have concocted back in the 60s when Lansdale was the king of \\"psy-ops.\\" Maybe Mendez studied under Lansdale? Mendez has a couple weeks to make a cover for a movie set in Iran, which the CIA used to pull the 6 Americans, who had escaped from the embassy during the siege, out of the country.<br /><br />Affleck reflects little remorse in his characters for having enjoyed a pretty good 80+ days as Canadian houseguests, while their 50 compatriots suffered the indignities of being the Ayatollah's houseguests. In fact, they seem to doubt the whole scheme (understandably), relatively content to hang out with Ambassador [[ASIN:B004CFAZQS Ken Taylor]] and his wife. The only really tense scene is when the Revolutionary Guard questions the Iranian housekeeper at the gate. The scene in the market, where Mendez takes his fake film crew, felt contrived, as did much of the movie for that matter.<br /><br />Either Mendez had a flair for the dramatic or Affleck couldn't resist jazzing it up a little. Whichever the case, the film felt a day late and a dollar short. There was no real understanding of the situation, no fresh insights. It was like Tony Mendez and the CIA could no longer stand Canada getting all the credit for pulling those 6 Americans out of Tehran, and after 20 years decided to tell the \\"real story,\\" and Ben Affleck was all too willing to oblige by building a movie around Mendez' memoirs., felt contrived, as did much of the movie for that matter.<br /><br />Either Mendez had a flair for the dramatic or Affleck couldn't resist jazzing it up a little.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I Just LOVE This Game! I Have It On My iPod Touch AND Kindle Fire, So Definitely 5 Star Review For Me! But One Thing I Might Add-I Wish It Was Easier To Get Diamonds! Also, For Those Of You Trying Out This App: For More Diamonds And Coins, There Is Some In-App Purchasing But Overall, AMAZING EQUINE APP!
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Kept a sense of tension throughout the film even if you know the story. Very entertaining and the bonus features provided interesting back story and &#34;where are they now&#34; information/interviews with the people who experienced the actual events.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This games prety fun. ive played other games like this before but quickly deleted them,  this one has lasted. Y<br />Thanks for the game.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I was ripping through each episode to get to the next. The whole series is fantastic and people have said Season 2 is slow, but I disagree.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I recommend it for everyone. It really expresses how to take care of a horse and teaches you all of the responsibilities.
B000NMW6M0|4.0|I like the movie, however is hard to understand ( I guess that is why is call Babel) it kind of kept me guessing at the end
B0094K1QR8|5.0|Great movie. Watched on my kindle. Awesome. The HD was really clear. Had to be careful because it looked like everything was moving really fast....but I loved it.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Really fun and surprisingly entertaining to watch. I highly recommend this show. Hardly thought it was a animation movie after a while.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Loads fast and easily. The game is good fun and fast, keeps you thinking. My wife and I love it!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|What's wonderful is that the user can download additional sounds from the webpage, and some of these sounds are even better than those that are included in the original program.  I find myself using this more at work as background noise to help me concentrate on the task at hand.  I also use it at night to help my mind focus on sleeping.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is just one big piece of poor book writing.  I should never have purchased it and I certainly will not buy the other two books in the trilogogy.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love this game! Fast moving. Good for eye-hand coordination. Can't get enough of it! Perhaps some different shapes would be great.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fell in love with this show first episode. Waiting for Season 4.<br />This is a must watch.  Want to see the castle in person.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|I'm not a gamer, and I know that this mouse is designed for gamers. However, as someone who frequently works with graphics and occasionally needs to tune finer details than I can with a typical good-quality mouse, this is an attractive product.<br /><br />Two downsides to it, however. First of all, one of the features of the mouse is the ability to tune its weight to fit your needs. Unfortunately, the documentation on just how to do that is very weak. It depicts the round slot in the mouse base where the supplied weights go, then says, \\"slide mouse cover back.\\" Except, nothing slides. Not the cover for the slot, nor any part of the mouse body itself. Of course, some part of the darn thing must slide...but where? I can't figure it out, and nothing in the documentation images shows it happening. Guess for yourself.<br /><br />So on to \\"support.\\" On-line material about the mouse is identical to what's included in the package. No help, in other words. You can email support; their automatic systems respond that they got the message. But otherwise, response is very slow. I still don't know how to make the weight option work.<br /><br />A final word about the documentation. The software for this mouse--you have to download it, not supplied--comes with no explanations for the beginner, which includes me. OK, DPI means dots per inch, but there are multiple settings for four different configurations of the mouse. Nowhere is there an explanation for how changes to those settings alter the performance of the mouse. It is entirely a self-taught thing and I, frankly, don't have a couple of hours to tinker with the alternative settings to learn what they do and whether they make the mouse more or less usable.<br /><br />So three stars is all this product gets. Probably a much better product than I may ever need, but it might as well be just another black box because very little is explained.<br /><br />-0-<br /><br />Since those first words were written, I have called in to tech support at Anker. Hah. What a trip. I reached a guy who sounded like he was still waking up. I'll call him Bryce. Bryce is clearly not a trained support technician. He's just a guy who answers the phone. He told me how the weights are supposed to work and was perplexed when it became clear that my mouse isn't working that way. (Turn the round cover to the place where the weights are support to go; it supposedly pops right out, on one that works). So Bryce said he would ship me a replacement mouse. While he checked inventory--as in, do they have even one mouse to ship?--I asked about the software. Bryce really doesn't understand the software, and we struggled to figure out two of the possible custom settings. One he puzzled through, but the second one, called \\"breathing speed,\\" was impossible to parse. Bryce said he would have to ask the product manager about it. \\"These are a new product for us, and we're still testing them to see how they work,\\" he said.<br /><br />Bryce was polite, but groggy throughout our conversation, very slow on the draw. Turns out they had no mice in stock. They might have some next month. Bryce said I should call back to request a replacement mouse sometime in March. I suggested that, instead, that since we had already had our call, maybe they could just send a replacement when it becomes available? Oh, said Bryce. Maybe he could do that.<br /><br />Pretty amateur-hour stuff. I am left with an impression of Anker as a company populated by kids who, after party hours are over, dabble in PC accessories. Sigh.<br /><br />-0-<br /><br />A final comment. Although the \\"twist and it pops out\\" approach doesn't work with this mouse, I was able, finally, to pry out the round cover using an unusually thin knife. Not ideal, but it works. The weights fit in place just fine. So, all's well that ends well.

B005ES11VK|5.0|Dont need to define how useful and essential crocs have become to an everyday use convenience rugged companion. good for garden errands. this design is very nice as it keeps dirt from getting to your feet, and has good traction compared to the classic model.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Welcome back Rebus. Outstanding book! Rankin did a fabulous job. It's so good to have him back. No offense, but the other books just weren't as good.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I loaded the game on my Amazon Kindle before and I deleted it by mistake, I was lost without it, so I had to reload it again because I really enjoy playing it for hours at a time in all the stormy weather the East coast has been receiving.
B008Y1YJ90|4.0|Excellent quality, good sound and more important at least on my case, we just loved the movie it's fun and has a great message to all members of the family.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Incredibly well done! Plausible plot and character acting throughout the entire series. A real life view of the upstairs/downstairs relations of early 20th century aristocratic life in the UK. Masterpiece theatre at its finest!

B00B2V66VS|2.0|I put it on my kindle, every time I was up to a good score I would lose the whole game. I've downloaded it three times now.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I preferred Jones' portrayal of Dave Robicheaux relative to Baldwin's. He knows the subtleties of a southern man. The cast in general is good and the adaptation doesn't stray far and is well directed. If you are a fan of James Lee Burke, you will probably enjoy this movie.<br /><br />If you don't now of Burke's work, but enjoy a flawed protagonist, colorful characters, connected criminals and Louisianan idiosyncrasies, you might enjoy this movie, give it a try while it is available on Prime and you could become a fan.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I just bought this today,so I have no idea how good or bad it is. I bought it so that when I go see the movie I will know what is going on.

B001XUJMZK|5.0|An epic movie filled with tons of action and suspense while fleshing out a story that, while predictable, is powerful and thematic.
B001230JXC|5.0|I've always loved many of these songs from this album.  I remember before I was able to buy my own music seeing many of the videos on MTV and that started a lifelong love for Depeche Mode and other harder electronic type acts.  This is the one that started it all and it's awesome.  A must have for anyone that likes Depeche Mode or electronic mood music.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Ok, CS Lewis is a name I have always heard but never explored. Decided to one day and ordered CS Lewis A to Z. This in turn gave me an insight to most books including this one.The story and the writing style is the best.

B0047WJ12K|4.0|My husband and I both really liked the movie, but it was hard to follow in some spots. It was nice that we had to talk about it to make sure that we were both getting it, but it's just not something to watch if you don't want to think too much.
1400069807|4.0|It's no secret that Americans are hooked on processed foods.  In Salt, Sugar, Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Michael Moss takes us inside the food industry to tell the story of our national addiction.  It's a troubling tale, or a whole series of troubling tales, that make me want to go to the farmer's market, or at least to the produce aisle, and avoid processed foods altogether.<br /><br />I do have mixed feelings about the book and this issue.  On the one hand, all the food companies want to do is sell more food.  They do have to make a profit, after all.  And their mission is to make the tastiest, most appealing food they can, so they can sell more and more of it.  They make it, we buy it, we eat it and like it, they make a profit.  It's a simple, free-market, mutually beneficial exchange.  But there's more to it than that.<br /><br />The ball got rolling when food manufacturers started making soda, chips, TV dinners, which they \\"imagined as occasional fare.\\"  But as society changed, they found that \\"snacks and convenience food had become a daily--even hourly--habit, a staple of the American diet.\\"  As convenience became more important to Americans, food manufacturers had to make food \\"easy to buy, store, open, prepare, and eat.\\"  In the laboratories (not kitchens, note.  These are chemists, not chefs, who are creating food.) of Kraft, General Foods, and other manufacturers, the \\"drive to achieve the greatest allure for the lowest possible price has drawn them\\" to salt, sugar, and fat.  As one executive said, maybe there is too much salt or sugar in our products, but \\"that's what the consumer wants, and we're not putting a gun to their head to eat it.  That's what they want.  If we give them less, they'll buy less, and the competitor will get our market.\\"<br /><br />Some of the food industry insiders Moss spoke to had second thoughts and reservations about their work, like one former Coca Cola executive, who travelled to Brazil for a market study.  \\"As he walked through one of the prime target areas, an impoverished barrio of Rio de Janeiro, he had an epiphany.  'A voice in my head says, \\"These people need a lot of things, but they don't need a Coke.\\" I almost threw up.'\\"  He was eventually fired.  Virtually all of Moss's subjects stated their own aversion, or at least extreme moderation, when it comes to their own products, pointing out the \\"class issue at work in processed foods, in which the inventors and company executives don't generally partake in their own creations.\\"<br /><br />The companies are not alone in their culpability.  The federal government has been their hypocritical partner in crime, with its \\"promotion of some of the industry practices deemed most threatening to consumers.\\"  Cheese, with its high fat content and warnings from dietitians to reduce consumption, enjoys huge federal subsidies.  The federal government has caves full of it because they promised dairy farmers they would buy their cheese.  Even the makers of the food pyramids produced and distributed by the USDA bow to the food industry lobby, putting politics before health.  I wish Moss would have addressed the sugar lobby, too.  Federal subsidies and import tariffs on sugar keep the cost of sugar unnaturally high and lead to many manufacturers using less healthy sweeteners.<br /><br />Moss also points out that the drive for profits at the food giants has contributed to the obesity epidemic. \\"In the early 1980s, investors shifted their money from stodgy blue chip companies to the high-flying technology industry and other sectors that promised quicker returns,\\" pressuring food companies to cut costs and increase marketing to satisfy Wall Streets demands for more and more profits.<br /><br />Ultimately, the consumer is in control of what he or she eats.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book kept me guessing almost to the end. It was a good read. I enjoyed it and would recommend this book.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I love most baseball movies and this didn't disappoint. Mostly had accurate baseball information which always helps me to enjoy a baseball movie. I also enjoyed the father / daughter relationship.
B00442OI1C|5.0|This is a great tv spy show. It's got everything. Humor, action, twists, romance. Something for everyone. Just watch it.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|There are so many heroes that we never hear about. This story shows the courage of one man against a student led revolution that changed a whole country.  Winning best picture against so many great movies was a quite an affirmation from Hollywood.
B003IDMUJA|5.0|This story, which is apparently been around since about 2006 is an inspiration to any young man (or woman come to that). It covers the 'growth' of a young boy of 14 years of age who due to the poorness of his family has to give up school. But undaunted he goes to the local library to look up books and learn about things that interest him. Suffice to say this motivates him to look to making some 'home made' equipment to enable him to have electrical power at home. All his friends think that he is 'stupid' or crazy or both. Even his own family doubt whether he is 'all there'. But with patience and diligence he prevails and achieves his goal, making a wind mill that produces electricity to light his home and power the family radio. He goes on to compliment this making all sorts of electrical cut outs and switches all hand made and completely self taught. Absolutly brilliant.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|It's a very fun game, but unfortunately deleted all of your progress when you get really far. I had almost all the characters and boards and 32 multiplier, and I got on one day and it was all gone! Same thing happened to my sister and friend :(
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was suggested to me by a friend at a time when I really needed it.  I couldn't put this book down.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|interesting concept for a game.  so far pretty challenging.  graphics are decent and minigame are challenging but not impossible to complete without using hints.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|this is a fun game, a no-brain type of game, but you still have to pay attention and find those matching squares.  i really like it cause it responds immediately, you click on a square in whatever postition its in, it responds.  and having the ability to twist and turn this thing is fun.  i agree that pause button is in the wrong place.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I enjoyed Argo thoroughly - a touch of suspense, good acting, pretty tight story.<br /><br />4-stars instead of 5 because I don't think I would watch it again.
B002SAUCBC|1.0|Didn't care for the book; it was very repetitive with people getting warned, etc. I wasted a lot of time reading this book.
B00B3EV8IU|4.0|A fine effort from Robin- personally, I dig the laid back (as a whole) feel of this record.  His playing is superb throughout with a super sweet tone-<br /><br />I have followed Robben's career for a long time and find this new work to be a very worthy addition to his discography.
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|I just want to say that I am deeply disappointed with the many, endless tragedies, deaths and near-deaths on Downton Abbey Seasons 1,2, and 3. Even so, I have watched and rewatched the episodes many times and have really enjoyed them...UNTIL Matthew was brutally, abruptly and instantly killed without warning. Honestly, I know that Dan Stevens wanted to leave the series, but GEEZ! The way it was written, Matthew's death was SUCH a shock and so nigh on to abusive to DA's adoring fans. Julian, did you to HAVE to make Matthew's death take place only MINUTES (seconds?) after visiting his young wife and their newborn child at the hospital! WOW! Now THAT is what I call ABUSIVE and CRUEL!!<br /><br />That night, I swore I would never watch Downtown again, that scene was so upsetting.  Doesn't Julian Fellows know how to create a gentle exit, instead of hitting us over the head and stabbing us in the heart with a LOUD THUD? I have often thought that watching series 1, 2, and 3 again would be delightful, but not anymore.  Even if I do ever watch them again, I will skip over Matthew's cruel, and senseless death and move on to other British pieces that are kinder to their fans. Though it is much shorter, my vote is for Jane Eyre with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens. Now THAT is a WONDERFUL series! Superbly acted and much more inspiring.  What a GEM!! I could watch that show a thousand times and still wish for many more episodes!<br /><br />Bye, bye Downton Abbey.  After all the tragedy and underhanded/\\"twisted\\" plots, and now SO MANY deaths of lead actors, I have lost my taste for the endless repetition of death and tragedy. It would be so great to finally arrive at something at least a little happy and stable in this bipolar series.  If it were me, I'd focus on Tom and finding a new love and acceptance in the Crawley family and helping poor Ethel find happiness at last. Plus, why the heck does poor Edith have to now contend with falling for another man she can never marry?  Whata crock! In fact, I even wondered if Tom and Mary would eventually get together with their two infant children? However, if things continue along the same lines that they have up until now, I fear Season 4 will be a dismal \\"no way to recupe after that\\" series and end up killing off BOTH of the BABIES, as well!! Honestly, I'm almost AFRAID to see what will happen next.<br /><br />Masterpiece Theatre and BBC, I hope you have something less traumatic and more insightful coming up soon, cause after last Sunday night, Downton is on it's way OUT. NO MORE DASTARDLY DEATH-CULTURE SOAP OPERA! Give us something real or, if not, at least something not so horribly depressing!!!<br /><br />By the way, Dan Stevens (Matthew) and Jessica Brown Findlay (Lady Sybil): I dearly look forward to seeing you again in future BBC shows. You two were really some of my favorites from the start. My best to you BOTH! Here's hoping that we will also see Ladies Mary and Edith, Tom, and Bates and Anna in future (less tragic) shows, as they are all superb actors! YOU (plus Dame Maggie Smith) are the reason we USED TO BE watching and waiting with baited breath to see what would happen next. So many fine actors. What a shame... Sincerely.
B008FYZIVY|3.0|The show was great and for the most part so were the dvds/  Until the very last disc of season 2.  It &#34;froze up&#34;.. Sometimes would just kick in and continue.  And sometimes I had to fast forward and miss a few scenes,  So it wasn't &#34;perfect.&#34;

B0029LCJJS|4.0|Much better show than I thought.  Good story line thus far and a good cast of characters make this a good watch.  Looking forward to finishing out the season.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I like it and it is very exciting and as Tom, Cruise does most of his own stunts it adds something to the movie. The locations are very interesting and the scenry is quite amazing.  Tom Cruise is more realistic in this movie as opposed to the Jack Reacher movie he starred in.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I have always been a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. Over the last few years we have seen a resurgence of his popularity in both film and television which ultimately leads to a comparison of the actors who play the role. I enjoy Robert Downey's campy, over the top performance for the sheer fun of it, but for me, there was little of the real Sherlock Holmes in his portrayal. Certainly not the image of the man I had conjured up in my mind while reading Doyle's work. I thought I had found him in Benedict Cumberbatch and the enormously popular BBC version SHERLOCK. Cumberbatch is a wonderful actor and brings Sherlock into modern day with a raw edginess and arrogance not seen in earlier portrayals, but there is an almost autistic coldness about him which makes it impossible to genuinely like Sherlock as a human being. Those rare moments when, almost against his will, he exposes a genuine emotion are so fleeting and so quickly quelled that you wonder if you really saw them at all. I want so badly to like him, but I struggle as the characters around him do to accept that I must simply take him as he is - flawed but brilliant. Brilliant in a way that few of us can even imagine. I admire him from afar without investing any of my own emotions. The sheer enjoyment is in watching his mind work. The shows' fast pace and the way the camera often whips about in circles, leaves you dizzy trying to keep up with his thought processes. I often feel like Watson in the first episode, limping along behind, struggling to keep up. The show is wonderful and Benedict Cumberbatch is a pleasure to watch. I strongly recommend it to anyone who has not yet seen it.<br />  Having said that, I have at long last found my Sherlock in Jonny Lee Miller and Elementary. For me, Miller brings a real humanity to the character - a heart and soul, however battered and broken, to go along with the brilliant mind. He's flawed to be sure. A recovering drug addict fighting the daily battles to stay clean, he can be childish, self-absorbed and arrogant, but while Cumberbatch's Sherlock seems to relish his superior intellect and quite enjoys lauding it over the rest of us with our little minds, Miller wears his brilliance like a heavy mantle. It defines who he is and he's constantly struggling to live up to his own expectations. He relishes the detective work because it offers an escape from real life. Miller gives us a fuller character, exposing his bitterness for an emotionally distant and absent father, a glimpse of the isolation that comes with genius, the complications that arise from seeing things that the rest of us don't see - evidenced when he describes his fear of flying. There is the hint of great love and greater loss and the sense that this Sherlock is capable of deep emotion - a Sherlock teetering precariously on the edge of self-destruction. And yet there is a poignance in Millers' portrayal that makes me care as much about Sherlock as I do about solving the crime. He illicits my emotions. There are moments when he makes me laugh, moments when he annoys me, and moments when a simple expression can move me to tears. His performance is nuanced - offering the many shades, if not the complete picture of a complicated, scarred and extraordinary man. It's not so much what Miller does with the lines, but more his facial expressions and his body language. In true detective fashion, it is often me watching him watch others, for it's what's between the words that matters. The words are merely what Sherlock wants us to know. The expressions, the movements and what he doesn't say are the clues to the real Sherlock Holmes. I have, at long last, found my Sherlock and he's everything I hoped he would be. I recommend the show to anyone still searching for theirs.
B0095P29EG|2.0|Did not care much for this movie but if you like campy movies it is OK. The acting is not very good but if viewed as a &#34;fun&#34; movie it is likeable.. My wife movies and she would watch paint dry if it was in a movie form.  She lasted through 10 minutes.
B009CPN2G8|4.0|Good ,but not as good as the others the story line not very good and not has funny has the others
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This movie is nothing like real life which is why most people watch movies.  Denzil is a wonderful\ actor and if love him you will like this movie. Having been in Air Force ROTC in college and a military brat I can promise you you can't flip this model plane upside down.  You can attempt it and if you do you will not be around to talk about it.  It is based on a plane wreck a few years ago.  Denzil and the other cast members do a great job in their roles.
1616550414|5.0|Awesome book for any Zelda fan. Lots of art, reading, and concept work plus a comic of sorts at the end of the book.
0385732554|5.0|I read this book with my niece probably 8-9 years ago for English class. We had many interesting conversations while we read it together along with much speculation about Jonas at the end. Really cool story about a society much different than our own. Both of us are rereading it  before we read SON.
0307891402|5.0|Awesome game guide but I do not play the game by it only look things up from time to time like ore spots don't want to ruin the randomness of the game.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I just adored the first Ice Age and have seen each one since. This latest installment was no disappoinment. Manny & the gang keep it going and come out on top again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey id a delightful television series that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat and waiting longingly for the next episode!

B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm not an avid reader but this series of books has me wanting more. Wonderful detail great suspense. An easy read.
B0053O89YM|5.0|I've not yet come across any TV show as consistently interesting and surprising and enjoyable as The Good Wife. The entire cast is fabulous, the scriptwriting superb, and I especially love the fact that characters are periodically introduced who continually reappear in later stories.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I saw the series on sale but didn't buy now I wish I had what a wonderful story just purchased from Amazon glad I did now I have Season 2 also.
B0063IH60K|5.0|best solitare on the web. Only complaint is there is no score tracking. Once a score is shown for a game it is lost when you start again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a great stress reliever and simple enough for almost anyone to use. I have had the games for almost two year and still haven't had a problem with the program.
B008EKON56|4.0|I own 3 iPod docks from Apple located in various places around my home to connect my family's iPods to our sound systems. Over time, the connectors in these docks get dirty and worn and no longer make a good connection with the iPod. But at over $50 apiece, they are too expensive to replace every couple of years. This little docking device provides both USB and audio connections, just like the Apple dock, but for a small fraction of the price. I'm sold. My Apple docks are out and these are in.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love this author. His characters come alive and keep you engaged to the end! looking forward to his next one, Even those who see the movie first will enjoy the book tremendously due to detail differences in the screenplay from the book.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I bought this for my husband as a gift. This is one of his favorite shows. It arrived on time and in good condition.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I like the ability to check the temp and conditions outside without the need to wait for &quot;my area &quot;.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|I just like stories about snipers.  I learn a little about accuracy shooting from the story.  A good conspiracy plot story
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I wanted a simple calendar for my Kindle to record appointments and reminders.  After trying and deleting some free ones, I splurged on this one ($5.99).  I have been very happy with it.  It allows you to view by day, week, month, and agenda format with simple tabs, gives you 17 choices of &#34;bullets&#34; in different colors to differentiate appointments.  For example, I use a green thumbtack for my son's appointments, and a orange check mark for my husband's.  You can install a mapquest app and have your appointment locations shown on a map.  It also stores names of your previous entries so I can just use the drop down menu and touch Chiropractor rather than entering it by hand every time.  I recommend it.
B001SKB1Y0|3.0|The ending did not address what happened to the other main characters. Will they get back together or is there a sequel in the making ???????? Seemed to have a lot of unexplained changes in script.
B005DOKL3E|4.0|The cover is comfortable to handle and fits the Kindle well.  Nice color also. Hope to discover it wears well.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Intelligent, witty, and easy to read. I recommend this to anyone looking to laugh and cry, or cry while laughing.
B004N9DVW8|5.0|CLASSIC COMEDY ONE OF MY FAVES LOL NON STOP LAUGHTER WHEN I SAW IT IN THEATERS. I'M THE MARY AND YOU'RE THE RHODA!!
B003NTSBUG|5.0|This movie really held my attention and kept me wanting more. The acting was good, and the storyline was interesting, although not entirely original. The ending was cool- summed things up without being predictable, anti-climactic, or too obvious. I would definitely recommend it for people who like a good suspenseful movie.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|This book is so boring and poorly written. I found myself skimming pages and only reading the conversations between characters. The author's writing style doesn't flow and there is just no climax. I couldn't make it to chapter 7.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is one of them series where almost every episode ends with you wanting to go right to the next episode. Peter, Walter and Oliveia all interact well and just when you think Walter is off the deep end he comes up with a new memory. Oh yea, this one is a keeper.<br />I am almost through the 2nd season, I just can't stop watching it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's been a while since I have read a series.  I was hooked after the first book.  I found myself sitting down for more than an hour several times to see what happens next.  I enjoyed the series.  Looking forward to the next film.
B0042VVLJM|5.0|I missed some of the nuances of the original movie. This director's cut fills in the gaps and improves the movie greatly. If you have 3+ hours to commit to this version, the time is well spent.
B003U4ZQRK|4.0|I liked it and am addicted to the series. However, this season was not quite as good. I would give it 3 1/2 stars. You sure can't fall asleep watching it.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|The songs reminded me of the 70's and what was going on<br />around that time the clothes ect!!  The Space Creature just<br />was awesome and when you add the Super 8 movie that the<br />kids made when you get to see it at the end of the movie it<br />was pretty good!! LOL I have recommended this movie to<br />others!!!
B009O2XY12|5.0|Great game. Can be played anywhere or anytime. It can be very addictive. Not sure it's good for young children.
1451695195|5.0|Amazing! Changed my outlook completely. I recommend to everyone who has lost someone or has a fear of dying. Will read and re read.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Easy to read and understand.  The book makes perfect sense and gives a lot of insight into how and why we do many of the things we do.  This book is a must for anyone struggling with any goal.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|original movie plot. good acting suspencefull.  America shows  it will go to great lengths for our own people no mater what race.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Excited to get the dvd set. Disappointed in the color quality of the dvd. Colors were washed out compared to watching the tv broadcast. But loved the show.
0307887448|5.0|As a video game addict, Author, Retro Game Collector, Arcade Cabinet Builder, SciFi Geek, Former Dungeon Master, Electronics Hack, Software Developer who has written games for the Atari 2600 and cut his teeth on a C=64, and overall Nerd in every category imaginable, I felt that, for the first time, someone has finally put into a novel, exactly why I get excited about these things! I am always telling stories about the computer industry, early video games and one of my favorite stories is about Warren Robinett's Easter egg in Atari's Adventure (I was about 11 or 12 years old when my friends and I found it). Now I feel like I can finally relax, this lore is now forever preserved in the story of this book and told in a way that can bring that excitement to anyone who reads it! Thank you Ernest Cline!
B005Q1W10A|4.0|Loved the show but the color quality as compared to the tv version was a bit washed out. Still enjoyed the show.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It definately fun. You can play with friends or random people too. I don't like that people are able to just draw the word that it is... takes the challenge away.
0743289692|5.0|should be a required reading for everyone, Very courageous author and deserves more credit from Free American Women and other countries that have women's rights and humane treatment of children no matter what gender
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My entire family is hooked on this series. Great characters, plot, action, etc. We never miss an episode. Watch it
B00787IR2Q|4.0|This is a great movie for the whole family with mon stop entertainment and laughs. You will watch it over and over again.
B00BGDF1FO|4.0|Thanks to the game I had a few of these songs stuck in my head for a good week (especially rules of nature)  so i like being able to listen to them when i want.
B009A87ZKG|1.0|I'm sure that this review will be lost at the bottom of some 3 or 4 hundred reviews but I had to speak the truth about this 7 Oscar winning Patton film. I served the bulk of my Army time with the 1st Armour Division at Fort Hood Texas and after my military discharge I did a little research about the tank division. Whenever I would see old film footage of World War 2 and the U.S. tank divisions, images of General George S. Patton as commander are proudly shown. As the tanks knock down the walls of various Nazi concentration camps, Patton and his tank division are first to get there. The film shows some foot soldiers and some other military officers as they tour the camps but they never show Patton's tank drivers, the soldiers who executed all of Patton's heroic deeds. Being a black soldier myself, I always look for the black soldiers in all military war films of World War 2 to gain a better understanding of their roles during the war. I look for them in Army, Marines, Air Force and Navy films of W.W. 2. On most of the war footage I have seen, the black troops are edited out of the film footage. They are edited out of the authentic Patton war footage and they are completely edited out of the Patton movie with George C. Scott. General Patton's complete division was comprised of black troops. Patton himself was very proud of his troops and they were the pride of the entire armour division. The only black soldier in the whole Patton movie was Patton's personal jeep driver which was probably intended to be an insult to the real heroes who served. I am not a historian or a civil rights authority but I know the truth from a fable and the film Patton is a fable. George C. Scott, Karl Malden and all of the actors did a first rate job of acting here but all and only to propagate a 7 Oscar lie. 1 star.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|As fantastic as Season 1....the acting and actors are amazing and really bring the period to life.  Definitely should be experienced.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I think people have a unrealistic view of how difficult TRUE relationships are. I would advise dating couples, and couples considering marriage to read this book early, to avoid trouble later. If your ready to die for the one you love, this book will strengthen your dedication.
B007REV4YI|5.0|In all honesty, I have not watched a Bond movie since the Pierce Brosnan series, but the anticipation? After all the reviews, and friends telling me I HAVE to see it... all I have to say? If you are a Bond fan, YOU HAVE to see this!
B000HF6ZR0|3.0|It was slow in loading on my Kindle...but other wise very good. The sound was good and the picture was good.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Quick, easy, fun read!!  She is a wonderful storyteller!!  You will certainly enjoy this one!  You will want to read this in one sitting!!
B0068THAGY|1.0|The previews were great. Some kids in the 60-70's who make professional films witness a mysterious train crash. Awesome! Then what? Unexplained things start happening, government intervention, stupid adults, and kids save the day, the end. Oh and the main character communicates with the alien for a second or two. That's it. There was all sorts of build up that only lead to an absolute worthless ending. In fact, I don't even remember the exact ending it was so uneventful.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I have never taken it upon myself to read this wonderful classic.  I very much enjoyed it and highly recommend it to all.
B007L6VR12|5.0|I was reading through some of the 1 star reviews and had to throw in my rebuttal. The only people who could give this movie one star are overprotective mothers and those who would probably enjoy something like 'Madea Goes to Jail'. Anybody who's immature enough to even remotely associate this movie with child pornography is a pervert and shouldn't be watching movies in the first place.<br /><br />Wes Anderson movies aren't for people who can't comprehend the simple things in life. Try slowing down and paying attention to the world around you from time to time. I enjoy every detail in this movie (and all of Anderson's movies for that matter). Each time I watch it I see more things I didn't notice before.<br /><br />The only thing not to like about this movie is that it's not long enough! If you can't handle small details or subtle humor, then go back to watching 'Fast and the Furious' or 'Madea' or something that your tiny brain can handle.
B008NW67E0|1.0|I bought this CD for my dad for Christmas and when he took out the case from the plastic wrapping, there was no CD inside. It would be nice if we got a replacement with an actual CD inside.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|My wife and I watched seasons 1-3 on the air, but then kind of forgot about this show.  Browsing a month or so ago, we stumbled upon Season 4 and started it back up.<br /><br />It took us a bit to get our bearings with what had happned in previous seasons (such as why the guys were in prison, etc) but once we caught on, it was a very enjoyable season.  Plenty of surprises for a Sons of Anarchy fan!
B000M39HB8|5.0|I'm old enough to have seen this movie when it first came out.  I like to use this movie in movie trivia.  Especially &#34;What movie was &#34;White Christmas introduced?&#34;  Also what is the name of the female lead in this movie?
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I got hooked watching this show through a monthly subscription service. I love it so much that I decided I had to add it to my library. My husband even watches it with me! I love that both seasons are combined in this slim box. Also includes great special features. As far as these discs being the 'UK version': I watched these online and have rematches the discs and haven't noticed any difference in content. I also watched the last few episodes of season 3 before they aired on TV in the US and then watched them as they aired on PBS and I didn't notice any differences. You're still getting the same brilliant characters and drama-filled plot you're used to. This show is excellent if you're looking for something different. It is unlike anything available on cable television nowadays. It beckons to an extinct time and place where honor was of utmost importance, moral living was the chosen way, and family was everything. If you haven't watched it, just watch one episode. It is well worth it, I can promise you that.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I bought this trilogy after I first borrowed these books from Amazon and liked them.  Also I wanted to reread them after I had seen the movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It is an emotion producing story about two people who love and care for each other.
B000HKYOK0|3.0|the shows were grainy and some audio glitches were present. I realize that the shows are old but did not anticipate such poor quality of video. Maybe i am being too picky, but thats why the 3 stars.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Not enough puzzles without paying for them. Not very fun - don't waste your time! Very Disappointing. Don't bother! Poor.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book was very slow and difficult to read at times. The plot is well thought out but I felt it took to long to get it across. In all just a very slow book.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I really enjoy playing this game but it's big flaw is that it requires you to have or open a Twitter accoint in order to record or track your score. I don't have a twitter account nor do I plan on opening one just for this game, so I can only give this a 3 star rating at this time.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|If you like science fiction with a bit of comedy thrown in you will enjoy watching these episodes. Just don't expect it to be too serious.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|very hard to get anywhere in this game without having to purchase coins or gems, graphics are nice but that is about it
B000UZNRS2|3.0|My first book read by David Baldacci, definitely not last.  I trust all his other books will be even more intriguing.
B003BKZW7C|5.0|This is a very suspenseful book.  For me, it wasn't a horror book, but rather a gripping, suspenseful and very engaging novel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers. I can't stop playing it. It is so fun. You should really get it. It is awesome. You can get different characters and hover boards to save you.
1400067936|1.0|You can't learn anything from this book; it's just a rant. The author's message is an incessant din of, 'I'm smart. They're stupid'<br /><br />\\"trading rooms were populated by people ..devoid of any introspection, flat as a pancake...\\" p28<br /><br />\\"these scientists ... devoid of the smallest bit of practical intelligence\\" p 30<br /><br />The author likes the word 'devoid'.<br /><br />\\"I was saved from the conversation of MBAs.\\"<br /><br />\\"but i could not conceal my disrespect ... as he could not make out the nature of my conversation\\"  p.31<br /><br />\\"a journalist ... is merely to sound smart and intelligent to the hordes\\" p 35<br /><br />He could have enlightened us about financial trading by giving us examples of how traders think on specific trades. Instead he reverts to generalization using fantasy scenarios. He deprecates losers without seeking to explain and understand those loser minds he excoriates. Nor does he explain winner thinking for that matter; except for the generality of praising caution.<br /><br />I stopped reading this book because the probability of finding anything enightening was approaching zero as the pages I read increased.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I think the most thought-provoking part of this movie was what it said about work, and life expectations.  Again, very inspiring.
0783226845|5.0|It was well written. I especially liked the character which Al Pacino played. I really felt what his character felt.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Love the movie and the actors.  I hope they do another.  They make my laugh.  The picture quality is excellent.
B002CSC5EC|2.0|This was a disappointment.  I had expected much better sound quality from a Bluray disk.  Most DVDs are much better sound quality than this blurry.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|I was looking forward to viewing all 9 episodes to catch up on missed ones.  However, each episode was interrupted 1 to 3 times by a poor connection.  I had to reboot my router and exited the website to reconnect.  That helped for a time but then had to repeat that.  I have little or no problem with Netflix.

0452295548|5.0|Everyone should read this. It will help you save a life someday; it will teach you a lot about how your brain works, and what you can do with it... and it will teach you compassion, because strokes happen to anyone from young kids, to your grandparents.<br /><br />Not a scientific primer, you won't get a headache trying to understand - because as a neuroscientist who studied the brain, and a stroke survivor, she explains it ALL in simple, and interesting language.<br /><br />If you know ANYONE who has had a stroke, years ago of days ago - make sure that those around them have this book, and if they are able to read, make sure they have a copy for themselves, and to share with all their loved ones.<br /><br />My Mom had 2 massive strokes this spring and was not expected to live. Luckily, I had seen this author do a presentation about stroking - and it made a big difference in how I 'pushed' a small local ER to get Mom to a bigger trauma hospital - and it saved her life. And encouraged me and my Dad tremendously. 10 months later, Mom can swallow & eat again, talk, walk, move. And finally even read again. One of her greatest encouragements is this author and this book.<br /><br />Even if you don't know anyone who has had a stroke, read this. It will help you recognize stroke symptoms, and you may really need to know it, because not all Doctors even get it.  And in knowing, you may save a life of a stranger, or someone you love, young or old.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|This is a good little mic for a starter, possibly even a just in case fall back choice in-case your wireless mic or batteries are dead. For sure it's better then the on board mic.
B003O86FMW|2.0|I just finished the book, and it has left me mentally drained from its contrived and ambiguous story development.  I don't have the same motivation to read the third book as I did for this one.
B009IAN56E|5.0|I absolutely love this album and would highly recommend it. The music is amazing and I can't stop listening to it. These girls are amazing!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Fantastic reading! The characters and the plot is vey good and realistc.  I highly reccomend it to any avid reader.
B000HL09MG|3.0|I am not a prude, but I was appalled by the amount of nudity and explicit sex in this movie. By all standards, it's porn. This is why I prefer the old movies.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|I like this product alot in that it's mobile and I can set it up pretty much anywhere and the Visuals on the screen is superb. Being part of the Military, I found that this makes moving and storage simplified being as it's easier to carry than a gaming system by itself or the consol's box along with a bulky TV. The only problem I found this far was that, despite what another reviewer said, I could not store the 360 controller in it without damaging something. Also you will have to make sure you have access to two outlets to play. One for the screen, one for the Console. Just for those who might not understand.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator is gods for simple math problems. If you need something to calculate large numbers with multiplication or division or addition or subtraction it will suit you fine. Wouldn't recommend for Huber level math problems.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|Highly recommended documentary that provides a rich background to the life and work of this provocative artist. Jamaica, rastafarianism, and the musical and political zeitgeist that Marley helped create and shape are explored and brilliantly presented.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|couldn't put it down. played non stop very addicting. love the game play. to the different realms and the story line. love the scary element as well.
B009FZFONO|5.0|It's great being able to stream the episodes and not have to watch the ads. Well worth the price every time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game!!!! It is better than temple run. The jet pack is great to play with. Trying to get all of the coins.
1609611543|5.0|I definitly am choosing gluten free for the most part after reading this.  I don't think I will give it up entirely.  Some things I just can't live without, i.e. pizza
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Fun game, great graphics. There are a lot of levels and multiplayer, and there is variety in weapons. Awesome Game!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD in 2010 but it had the plastic wrap on it for about a year and a half, then I opened it, made it about 7 days and quit.  This time (3 years after purchase) I was determined to make all 30 and I just finished my 30 days today (in a row!) I hate exercise. HATE. I don't mind walking the dog around the block but anything with weights?  Forget it. If I can do this, anyone can. It's not easy but it's only 27 minutes so definitely doable! Just press play! Once it's over you will be glad you did it! I actually gained 1.4 pounds while doing this (was already at goal weight) but I lost a pant size! I can see noticeable difference in my arms, upper back, tummy, and legs.  Muscles? What are those? I never had any of those showing in my life so this is exciting to me. I am started her Ripped in 30 next. Definitely recommend this!
B004GYY714|4.0|now I can listen to my favorite talk shows on my time. easy to navigate and find whatever i'm in the mood for.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|The Black Keys rock. I can't believe I had never heard their music until last year (2012). This album is very catchy but \\"Brothers\\" is really, really good, too.
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|Fun game but can be competitive.<br />  Controls schemes are comfortable and work properly. Visuals are great , very detailed but not stunning.<br />Final thought great helicopter simulator with good enough visuals that are detailed but not spectacular.Controls work smooth and steady.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Being in the middle of my mother's Alzhiemers, this was VERY thought provoking.  I have chosen this as my book club selection as I think it brings up issues with both the person that has the disease as well as the others around them.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I like it but you only get 15 minutes!!!!!!!! I mean how do you build a structure in fifteen minutes besides that the GAME is good.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I bought this for my nieces and they are thrilled.  They will watch it repeatedly, never tiring of watching the same movie repeatedly.  I bought it durinh bad weather, knowing that they would get cabin fever if they were trapped inside for too long.  Problem solved.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love how you can zoom in on illustrations. It makes reading so much easier and funner. Buy awesome books an read. So simple. It is portable too!
0547884591|5.0|Boutght as a gift for a friend,  this book contains so much more than meets the eye.  Great recipes and equally great stories, &#34;The Four Hour Chef&#34; is a great gift for a cook who enjoys reading.  Nice piece of work.
B000UZNSWM|4.0|Lot of background information. It makes a new sense of political and military hierarchy stand out. Macarthur should should have been relieved after he lost the Philippines.
0618526412|5.0|I'm so glad this is in the Oprah Book Club, it is truly an overlooked gem. Unlike Hemingway it does not deal with war or hunting. It isn't sufficiently strange or carnivalesque to be Faulknerian. But it is a greatly imagined piece of fiction. How does any author sneak into so many different lives, eaves drop on so many different kinds of speakers? We shouldn't say anything about the author's age except to admit how astonishing an achievement this book would be for any author, let alone one who was only 23 when she was writing the book.<br /><br />Mick Kelly is a great character. She is yearning for beauty like many a protagonist in a Kunstlerroman, but Mick doesn't know that there are artists or that one can yearn to be one, so her ache has all the more purity and poignancy. She is sure she only needs to save up enough money to buy a piano. This is all it would take to make her happy. She might be right.<br /><br />There is a lot more of merit going on in this novel. One could read it to know how people thought and talked in the Depression. What they hoped and dreamed for. What were relations like between whites and blacks? But I think it is the story of the girl Mick that really sets this book apart. There is a short list of books that really understand children or that are written about kids for adults. David Copperfield and Huck Finn are two kids we all should know. There are the kids in [[ASIN:B005GM11J6 Lord of the Flies]], there is young [[ASIN:0141186739 Studs Lonigan (Penguin Classics)]]and then there is Mick Kelly. All three of which I ruminated on as I was writing my novel [[ASIN:1481250086 The Merry Life of Charles Parker]], which is also a novel for adults about kids. For me *The Heart is a Lonely Hunter* will always be a charming and moving touchstone of American literature because of the steady gaze with which it studies particular and peculiar ways we have found to live together.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I reccomend to everybody who likes such a music. I listen whole CD time after time and still not enough.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Sucks you in from the beginning and you can seem to peel yourself away from the screen. Grips you. Gores you.
0670026603|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this book, knowing how it would probably end. However, I was glued to the book for 3 days. Can't remember crying over a book before. The book was funny, sad and inspirational. I suppose some might call it sappy, but I didn't feel that way. Am not sure how realistic the travel with a quadriplegic was but the emotions felt very real.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|This is a fun show that incorporates the old west with futuristic time.  It makes for some fun and excitement.
159102594X|5.0|I have to confess that I bought all three books in this series in 2009, and then just couldn't bother with them. What a mistake! I raced through book 1 in a day. I read fast, but this is not a small book. And on to book 2. Others have gone in to detail on what the books are about, so all I can say is I am sorry I didn't start sooner!<br /><br />You can bet I didn't make the same mistake with his other books!
1439181780|5.0|This is one of my favourite little books. I really enjoyed reading the entire book and now I'll just pick it up every now and then and read a few pages here and there and it always inspires me to be as positive and open as I can be. I would gladly recommend this book.
1451695195|1.0|The title of this book is very misleading.  There are several problems and logical errors with the author's claim that his experience is proof of heaven. First, he may be sure he experienced all he said, but if he had brain damage (or even if he didn't) even he can't know, let alone us, how accurate the recollections are. Second, even if we stipulate that his recollections during the coma are all accurate, major problems remain.  A. He presents no rigorous data to document his claim that his cortical brain was entirely dead during the coma. Where are the scans, read-outs, etc demonstrating this? If he did not want to include this in the text, it could have been included in an appendix. After his claims depend on this claim being 100% verified, yet all we have to go on is his word. B. He argues, again without rigorous evidence,  that the \\"lower\\" (non cortical) parts of his brain could not produce anything like \\"conscious perceptions.\\" But even his use of that phrase is misleading, since his \\"heavenly\\" experiences were obviously not conscious ones in any normal sense, but surreal, other-worldly ones reminiscent of hallucinations. C. Even if his cortex were completely non-functioning during the coma, and even if his lower brain was uninvolved during the coma as well, there must have been times while he was going into the coma, and later recovering before coming out of the coma, when his cortex was partial functioning. Please grasp this critical point. He himself admits he had no way to judge time or how much of it passed while he was \\"out\\" so it is entirely possible, if not likely, that he experienced what he did while he was coming out of the coma, and his brain was impaired, but partially functioning. Indeed, he presents several known and plausible ways people can have NDEs due to brain impairments.  Oddly, he dismisses all of the explanations in his own case on the subjective grounds that his experience was too complex and \\"real\\" to have been produced by a \\"dead\\" brain cortex.  However, the fact that he recovered and had little if any brain damage (other than not always thinking logically, which might not be a new symptom :^)) strongly suggests that his brain was not totally dead during the coma. Again, he ignores the critical point that there had to be points on either end when it was at least partly functioning. This serious oversight alone causes his whole thesis to fall apart. His credibility would also have been improved, and suspicions of bias, exaggeration, and conflict of interest removed, if he had donated the proceeds of his book to charity. But again, for the reasons just noted, even if he is 100% sincere, the logical flaws in his \\"proof\\" make it far from that.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I liked it ... it was just okay. I didn't love it; not sure why not. Perhaps I just didn't care for the writing style (?) ... I'm not sure. It just didn't leave a huge impact on me. I have many similar books on the same type of philosophy that I preferred much more ... but if you are a fan of Don Miguel Ruiz, I'm sure you will love it.  This book has so many fans though and such good reviews that I am open to giving it another read in the future. If my opinion changes in the future, I will definitely edit this review.
B00B3EV8IU|5.0|I am surprised at some of the more negative reviews of this album, for I feel the exact opposite. I have played this CD no less than four times today alone and I dearly love it.  Yes, it's &#34;covers&#34; but so what? There is nothing wrong with that for, I have always enjoyed discovering covers that I wind up liking better than the originals.<br /><br />Robben's guitar playing and his vocals are as clean and pure as can be. If you're looking for fuzz, distortion and screaming, then this is not the album for you. If you are looking for purity, with class and style, then this is the album for you. I would be remiss if I left out kudos for the B3 and stand up bass as well, just first class all the way!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Loved the movie! It definitely deserved to win an academy award for Best Picture. I would recommend this movie and I will most definitely watch it again. :-)
B00BESCJII|5.0|Really excellent coming of age movie. Great characters, great storyline, and amazing acting. Its a must see and I highly recommend it.
B006L9B6TI|4.0|I enjoy all of Rhonda Byrne's books ... The Secret; The Power; and The Magic. The Power is my favorite. This book is okay but I have always been a 'grateful' person and have always realized the importance and benefit of counting my blessings so in that respect this book did not provide any big 'uh-huh' moments. It's a good book though and I would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of Rhonda Byrne.
B00000IQCA|3.0|I found this DVD to be too long. The fashion shots were of interest but there was so much else going on it was hard to focus on fashion, as fashion, or the rambling story line. Ranked as a comedy, the American humour for me fell flat. However, it was an entertaining interlude and a very different take on the Paris Fashion Week. I much preferred the fast moving DVD The Devil Wears Prada.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|Downloaded MP3 version ... good dinner music; nice selection of songs and I enjoy it very much. I would recommend. :-)
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|So far, this series has stayed interesting just based on the story itself.  It's nice to see a film that doesn't dedpend on special effects.
B0026772N8|3.0|I don't know what all the fuss is about. I've tried to get in to this book at least three different times and I just can't stay focused. It seems to be a very popular book, but for some reason I just can't get excited about it.
B00BHMF578|3.0|One only need look as far as the trivia and goofs on IMdB to find plenty of information to make Argo harder to watch a second time. Many liberties were taken, inaccuracies were abundant.    I'm all for taking reasonable dramatic license, but this one--for me--just goes a bit too far:  [...]    Obviously, Affleck is a decent director, but his attention to detail is sorely lacking, and that's one reason why I feel he didn't get a best director nomination.    It's difficult to believe this was awarded best picture, given the historical meticulousness of a film like Lincoln, and the pure beauty of a film like Beasts of the Southern Wild.    Overall, it is \\"just ok.\\"
B000U0O9FM|5.0|This is the 18th time I've read this novel. Still as amazing as the first time I read this. Just perfect.
B007IK44CK|4.0|It is a good action movie, with exciting sequences throughout that will keep you watching the movie. Better than the first MI movie.
B008EZVNO0|4.0|Haven't gotten new one yet, but just a little quiz as to the roots of van. And perhaps an answer to his questions on new release. If the answer to the question does not occur to you, maybe \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" rings true?<br /><br />And have you ever heard Jim Morrison's take off of \\"Gloria\\"? Listen to it, it is hilarious. And no, he (Jim) did not get arrested for it. (And no, Jim and Van are not related.)<br /><br />Lots of ?'s, too many never enough.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great book! Cant wait to read the rest and see the movies. Right up there with the Twilight series. Love Angels and Demons stories.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Tom Hardy is an amazing actor.  The only gripe I have is the ending.  It could've been a bit more satisfying, but nonetheless I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a creative movie.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|I approach every Steven Wilson related project release with anticipation. Although The Raven has almost a jazz fusion feel to it, it is easily accessible. Maybe Alan Parsons had some influence in this? Listen - it won't hurt.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Should not have been released.  After Matt Damon, the movie franchise ended.  We all knew it wasn't gonna continue once he left.  I'm a Renner fan, but this was a horrible sequel.
B004PR71JC|5.0|This is soundtrack compliments the movie! Wish it included some of the other tid-bit songs played in the movie, but it includes all the main songs. Excellent way to perk up your day and get your body moving. Just all around good-mood music!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|If you enjoy rough and tough man-movies with action, blood, explosions blah blah blah, this is a good one.  I personally enjoy this kind of movie on a Friday night when I just wanna see Statham beat people up.
B004NSULHM|1.0|It's hard to imagine this came out of the same band that made \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\". It's such a shame that such musical talent goes to waste on an album like this. You've got a band with three awesome guitarists, and yet none of that is displayed here. The music is nearly unlistenable, and has virtually no redeeming qualities. It always amazes me that people will say things like \\"if you are really a true fan of ____ then you will like this\\". That's just ridiculous. I listen to what sounds good, and this does not sound good (to me). If you like an album of weird, repetitive sounds then maybe this album is for you. It's certainly not for me.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Picked this up as a FAOTD. Love this game! Graphics and 3D effects are excellent. Cool option with puzzle modes. My only complaints are the inability to erase your own leaderboard and the irritating request to connect to Amazon Game Circle.

B008FPZQRO|5.0|This is a great album.The first time I met this album was on vinyl.Through the years I bought different editions on cd.I wasn't quite satisfied with those cds.However,this time I can say that \\"they hit the nail on the head\\".This Tarkus set 2012 sounds FANTASTIC!.It was a good idea to have Steven Wilson for the remasters and remixes.He's done a wonderful job.I want to thank AMAZON because the service is excellent and very fast.Tarkus is probably one of the best albums of the progressive era.I would like to see the same treatment for the other albums;especially those that belong to the best moments of ELP and as well the progressive era.For example:\\"Pictures at an exhibition\\",\\"Trilogy\\",\\"Salad brain surgery\\" and \\"Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends\\".As a fan of ELP I strongly recommend this new edition of Tarkus.It contains 3 discs.2cds and 1 dvd.The 1st cd is the original album,the 2nd one is the album with new mixes and the 3rd is the dvd audio.You can play  the dvd audio on any dvd player or blu-ray player.I'm not sure if this dvd audio has another layer for only dvd audio players because I don't have that hardware.I played it on my blu-ray and it sounds terrific.A MUST.

0783222955|5.0|Just a great movie to teach respect among all nationalities. At our bible class this past sunday we had an hour long lesson on<br />learning to respect all nationalities in the whole world. God did create us all. We are truly all related. The father  displayed good principles in his own life and taught his children values. To feel the pain of others, and compassion. Our children today are flooded with bad information and behavior. Grand Theft auto should be outlawed as dangerous to our youth and their children mimmic what they see...when it is paraded in front of their eyes...it is in their minds in a distorted way. As their little minds are not mature enough to digest such terrible examples...it will affect their behaviour later. Just look around and you will see it.Sad our government does not care to regulate videos, movies and advertising on television and around town in video stores. Putting women on ads in very immodest clothing, and cigarettes in hands and alcohol in their other hands on billboards. Parents and family need to be good mentors for their children.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We've followed the show since it's inception, and with Season we've not been disappointed! Great writing, beautifully shot, and the transaction on Amazon Instant Video was seamless. Well done Amazon!
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|It is to good to look at others lives and put yourself in their place. It makes you rethink how you view others in your own community. And show more compassion to be a great neighbor. Love thy neighbor as thyself.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I<br />Loved it had to read it all the way through. I haven't read a novel this good in years.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks sure can make a love story. Sorry, that, again, it is set in NC, (I like NC), but wonderful reading...
B008OOYALE|5.0|do not really know having problems getting it to come up.when i get chance to play i will let you know.
B000FCK65W|5.0|movie MANY years ago.  Loved it then and loved the story as I read it.  Times were tough by our standards but attitudes were good and mostly positive.  Good read.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I purchased this for my wife who loves it.  She enjoys having the Blu-ray, DVD and Digital copy as well.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Pretty good story with very interesting characters, I was sorry that it had sort of a crummy ending, maybe there will be a second book???
B008WCP2KG|5.0|I purchased this movie pack for my wife who loved the movie.  She was quite excited to get the Blu Ray as well as the DVD and Digital copy as well.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I just happen to like this character, a little bigger than life, extra tough, s no BS sort of guy. I'm just sorry that Tom Cruise of all people is going to be the lead in the first movie coming out about Jack. I couldn't think of a worse choice. Jack is tall, fair, and an ex-Marine. Just not what I think about when I picture Tommy boy.
B00B4MUSHI|5.0|That Monsoon theme alone sold me on the fact that the whole game was going to have a great soundtrack... AND IT SURE DID!!!<br /><br />The game's music changed as you made progress during a boss battle.... IT IS BLISS fighting & having the themes  get louder & then the lyrics kick in.<br /><br />I HOPE OTHER DEVELOPERS USE MUSIC LIKE PLATINUM DID IN METAL GEAR RISING REVENGEANCE!!!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Although touring frequently with the revitalized Moody Blues Justin Hayward seems a rare guest in the studio. This being his first solo album since 1996. And not a whole lot of M.B. records either in this time.<br /><br />What we get here is classic Hayward, well-written songs, heatfelt and clever lyrics mostly about romantic love. And mostly with his peculiar branch of touching melancholy. His dreamy guitar all over the place, supported by Anne Dudley's string arrangements. Most songs slow to mid tempo perhaps the album could seem a bit boring at first listen. But this is real Songs that slowly but surely grab the ears and work their way into the 'subconscious', keep rotating on the inner jukebox.<br /><br />We do not hear that much of the psychedelic pioneer, but there is an udeniable undercurrent of unobtrusive sprituality on this beautiful low-key album. Not a big come-back or a radical new direction - except for some country influence in 3 of the songs amongst them a reworking of \\"Broken Dreams\\" - it is more like a thoughtful letter from a long-time, treasured friend.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Recommended to me by a reader who never reads anything that might be Science Fiction. This book isn't too far out there, just a good read.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|The description of this documentary is a bit misleading.  It isn't a wild thriller or anything like that.  It simply documents this man's online relationship and how it doesn't turn out the way he would like.  His girlfriend wasn't exactly honest with him.  The description makes it sound like it is an exciting and thrilling adventure.  It really isn't.  But all in all, I did enjoy it....for what it was.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|The levels can get a little repetitive but it's still fun. Very responsive controls-guiding the fish feels intuitive. It is a beautiful game.
B00ALCBU4M|2.0|This flick is loosley based on the video game by the same name.  It's a low budget yarn featuring Tom Sizemore, perhaps coming back from endless personal problems.  A US Army unit during a routine mission is by chance immersed into the Battle of the Buldge. Then practically down to last man, inherites a mission that could determine the outcome of the war.  The begining is quite promising, but as the film progresses it slips into some mindless dialogue and dimminished CGI effects.  The Nazis are portrayed as dumb as rocks and are slaughtered in hordes.  The culmination is what blossoms into a shootem-up movie version of the game.  Great to watch with beer and pretzels!
0385528752|4.0|I have read this book twice now. Once, around when it came out and a friend lent it to me on the beach. This time, I am actually working on some change management issues and wanted to re-read the book. I think it's much more readable and enjoyable than other change management books. The authors use a number of very helpful examples and their style is accessible and clear. I would recommend it for either purpose - an enjoyable business book or a reference when change is needed.
B000FC146C|3.0|I just didn't like most of the characters but found reading the book more satisfying.<br />Celibacy is unnatural-in my opinion and has created a lot of grief for the religions that demand<br />it.
B000000OMB|5.0|You don't find this one anymore, they were sort of an obscure band.  The CD was in excellent condition, the price was right and the delivery was quick.  Am really enjoying revisiting my youth!
B0085OELXK|2.0|This movie went no where.  I ended up not finishing it so I maybe it picks up  in the end.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This book was fast-paced, well worded and had a great storyline you connected to the characters and I couldn't put it down. Amazing read!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Too many details about his illness and too little about what he experienced during his out of body.  He didn't really convince me of anything.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Along the same story line at the previous Bourne movies.  If you liked them,  I think you will like this movie
B0082SU98U|3.0|Usually the book is much better than the movie. That is not the case with the story in this book.
B0064W65SO|5.0|Great start to a better more realistic version of Batman.<br />The characters were real and even the good guys had dark sides to them, to show that we are all humans. Great story!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like playing solitaire, very easy to play, fun to play I have played solitaire on my computer and this is more fun to play
B007BFSYMS|2.0|may not be a bad app,  its just not my thing.  ill probably delete it off my kindle.  if you are into the background sounds though  it would be good for you.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Fascinating to have insight into such a different life than my own. A first hand account of the many facets of not only becoming a SEAL but going into combat and the complications in life that can follow.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i love angry birds.  its an addicting and challenging game.  its much harder than i thought it would be but it gets you thinking along with having fun.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|Little dated but grandkids that are new viewers liked it. Everything is new to them but they love this even though its a little slow for me.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love it.  Works well on my kindle ...Picked a good time to buy.  lot's of snow!  The map function works perfectly.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I loved the movie.  Very heart wrenching.  Loved the realism of the movie and the ending was surprising.  Not his usual role but outstanding just the same.
B003UESJH4|5.0|It is well acted and easy for us to understand - sometimes the English accent makes makes following their movies more difficult for my husband and I.  That is not so in this case.  We loved the story which appears to be historically accurate.  It's a wonderful glimpse into a struggle that seemed a romantic episode, but actually was extremely selfish.  The king is a VERY brave and admirable man - and perhaps this gives us an insight into his daughter, Queen Elizabeth, and her family disfuctions.  This is one of those movies that truly is worthwhile.
B0061S073A|3.0|I like this. The user interface is simple enough for the kids to use and the background is colorful so they enjoy it. I like that there are several wallpapers to choose from. The password works well and if people are complaining their children hacked the code, they probably chose something too simple. Oh, and for my one child that figured she only had to turn it off to bypass the interface, I put a passive on for startup. It was simple to add the apps but a little confusing at first on removing them. The children have no issue getting their app of choice to work and they enjoy having some autonomy choosing their game. I have only two complaints.<br /><br />One, occasionally if I or the kids forget and hit the home button, it goes to the actual Kindle home and not the Kids Place home. It doesn't stay there and they can't do anything but before going back to the Kids Place interface it goes to a screen pretty much saying hey, you can't do that and that's annoying; I've wondered if it might stay there but so far it hasn't.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is, WHERE ARE THE BOOKS?! I got this Kindle for myself but I did want the the children to be able to use it occasionally. I looked into Kindle Free Time but I didn't go with it since it was a subscription service and my children wouldn't be using this enough for that to be a needed expense. I was pleased when I came across this and felt it would be a good substitute and for the most part it has. However, as much as my family likes our games we enjoy reading even more. My children have complained saying they were bored with the games (there's an extensive collection) and want to read instead but they're unable to do so inside of this app unless it happens to be an app that's also an interactive book (I've come across come across a few but two of my children are advanced enough they're quickly bored after a couple of uses.). I'm unwilling to turn off this interface for them to do so because that defeats the whole purpose..
B009GEAPYW|5.0|This is a very faithful adaptation of Frank Millers graphic novel. I can only hope the 2nd half lives up to this first half of it. I really love the sound track to this movie and will buy it on I tunes if available
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was a lot of fun. The graphics are great and the storyline is relatively interesting. This is my favorite type of game, a combination of HOG and adventure/puzzles. There were a couple of areas that had me confused and running in circles for a while and I used more hints than I care to admit there but I rarely used hints otherwise. A couple of the puzzles also didn't give adequate directions so they took me forever. I liked the idea of going back and forth between the realms to get what I needed and I enjoyed having Miles as a companion. My one complaint is that $5 is too steep a price for a game that was over so quickly. My family enjoys doing these type of games together and it didn't take us more than a few hours. Even by myself I don't imagine it exceeding that time much at all.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Dr. Who never fails to intrigue and challenge us. I do find the new Doctor and Amu very engaging. Always good.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|GREAT BOOK ! Cant wait to read the next one. So many things happens, it gets your attention from the beggining to the end ! A must buy if you are a fan of the series !
B00BHBBSZ2|2.0|2-25-13 -- This app did not work for me.  I couldn't get the handwriting to come out the right size, and the keyboard would not come up when I wanted to try typing instead.  I changed to Notepad Pro and  found out that the Kindle's &#34;predictive text&#34; system is faster than handwriting anyway.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Update: Bought it in 2011. Now is july 2015 and still works perfectly.   The surround and stereo sound are great. The microphone works well, and the build quality is really good. Battery last alot, so dont worry with that ! The wireless on the headset is just perfect.
1426209584|5.0|This book is an extremely beautiful work, and as a Nature Photographer, I am very glad to have it. Comes with a very complete text, explaining the almost 10 years expedition to New Guinea to photograph the 39 species of birds of paradaise. I live in Brazil, the second largest contry in terms of bird species (more than 1,800), and never seen so beautiful birds like these.
B000A7S4B0|4.0|After the critical & commercial success of  \\"B.R.M.C\\" &  \\"Take them on..\\", BRMC did something quite out of character for a rock band, they took a creative risk!<br />& produced their own reverse version of \\"Bringing it all back home\\" , an acoustic based record.<br />Mixing roots, blues, folk, gospel. & Zeppelin III, BRMC created an retro, but fresh sounding record, merging well with the bands contemporary style. with a well thought out selection of songs.<br />Not an entirely successful record (these suddenly changes of musical genre, normally take a couple of tries to nail) but pretty darn close, & I would certainly have a band keep trying to push themselves creatively, than produce the same album every time.
1451650728|5.0|I liked the story of Noonien Soong, and his supposed 'escape from the usual lifespan', he built up a huge empire, and he was always being one upped by someone who had gone before him centuries ago. Similar theme to the Caeliar in Destiny in a small way. Exploring the themes of eternity. Great ending too. Bringing back (a new) Data was good too.
B000BNI90O|5.0|can't wait to see the hobbit movie soundtracks in complete recordings....<br />highly recommend these soundtracks. . . . . .
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I turned off the show within a half an hour of it starting. It is very cheesy, bad acting and characters were not likable.
B003V5ED7W|4.0|I finally watched this movie based on the recommendation of a friend who watched it years ago when he was 10 or so. I enjoyed it but it IS a Disney movie. Not realistic at all - it's as if the real story was thrown in a bottle of bleach to get rid of ANY dirty parts. Again, I enjoyed it (I love John Candy) but it is not a movie for adults. I am now almost 40 and I can see myself spellbound had I seen it 30 years ago!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|didn't pay attention to this site when it was on tv until there was a marathon, I fell in love with it from the beginning. It's like an updated version of the x files
159102594X|5.0|I was pointed to this book by friends (r/asoiaf) after finishing A dance with Dragons and it is very well written! I'm about halfway done with the book but the characters are very well developed and the story line is interesting. This series will hopefully keep me busy until the 6th ASOIAF book comes out!
1451695195|5.0|This book is wonderful for those who are not quite sure there is really a heaven at the end of our time.  I like the fact that he is a doctor and sometimes it is hard for those with scientific knowledge to realize the spiritual side of life is real too.  Would highly recommend this read.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Having trouble putting these books down to eat and sleep!!!  Plenty of action and intrigue and great characters you can identify with.
B000JIN3J8|3.0|I picked this movie because it said Colin firth was in it. However, this was not the version that had Colin firth in it. It was a completely different one.
1449410243|5.0|I bought this for my teenage daughter -  she loves it.  So, if you have a teenage daughter who loves animals this is probably a great gift for her.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Towards the end the music was great.  Our two parakeets went crazy to the point we couldn't hear the television.  So when the experts in song love it what more is there to say!
B0054SMID0|5.0|A predicament deeper than any chess game. Edge of my seat the whole time. Made me think. The lawyer fixed things cleverly rather than there being implausible fortuitousness.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|sad that kristin stewart doesn't have more talent than twighlight.  all other actors excellent.  snow white could have been so much more.
B006O5YIMQ|5.0|I like MMA stuff and so I thought this was good. Predictable, but still good.<br />Good quality.<br />What more to say, two brothers separate by life's events eventually have to fight it out.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|THE STORY LINE IS RIVETING.. THE ACTING IS GREAT AND THE SCENERY IS SUBLIME.  GIVES US A GREAT LOOK AT LIFE OF THE RICH IN JOLLY 'OL AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Lives up to all the great reviews. Riveting story lines, likeable characters, beautifully filmed....keeps you wanting more.... no R-rated scenes or language thus far..yhey!
B004UID2LC|5.0|i love it. great app and does exactly what it is supposed to.  the ui could be a little better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So good surprised by the ending but sitting on pins and needles for Season 4.  It is a must watch.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a great read!  I enjoyed the story very much.  It was good to see the struggles the main character dealt with, and how it impacts those around him.  It was well written, and keeps the reader engaged and wanting to read more.
B006PTNQGU|3.0|Has good values on being rich and shows that being greedy has a cost. Would recommend it for 6 and older.
B003B02O7I|5.0|Grisham usually writes lawyer's books. This one is filled with intrigue, passion, violence and mistery. Throughout most of the book it keeps you gessing and when it unravels in the last pages, you're left with a troublesome feeling that stays many days after the end of the book. Kudos to a great book!
B008OOYALE|1.0|this games sucks I would highly recamend not to get this game. it takes forever to load a new dragon.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started this DVD feeling pretty cocky; I thought Level 1 would be a walk in the park. It was definitely doable for motivated beginners (as another reviewer put it), but I was sore for a day or two afterwards. It definitely gets your heart rate up and your muscles going in a way that you don't get on the treadmill or elliptical at the gym, pushing you out of your comfort zone. Switch up the lessons on different days to avoid boredom.<br /><br />You do need a set of hand weights (if you're just starting out, don't be fooled by how light 2 or 3 pound weights feel at the store--you'll be doing plenty of reps with them, and they feel heavy fast. Save the heavier weights for later in your fitness journey) and a mat, but that's it. I love that it's minimal and doesn't require you to shell out much extra money.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This Bond movie takes you deeper into Bond the man.  I enjoyed learning about his past and loved the scenes shot in Scotland.
1449325947|5.0|This is one of many of Mr. McFarland's books I own and as usual was on point! For me, in order to truly understand the concepts of CSS3 it is best to practice what you read. This book truly encourages that and that is why I like it so much...read then practice the concepts! If you have the mindset to take the time to learn this information and focus a few nights a week, you can complete this book in no time.<br /><br />For the beginner you will gain a great understanding of how things work. As always I speak from the novice standpoint and if I can understand it then a seasoned professional will also get what they need quickly. He also lets you know about different browser support for CSS3 and what is supported and how to get around different versions of IE.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|useless app... maker is just using a bit of math to make money.  Unless you have money to help this programmer out don't waste your money.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Very calming and the opportunity to see the phases all over time zones.<br />Very nice to know that we still have all this and that we can indeed see it<br />in all its splendor.
B005P5TQPU|4.0|I love this show so much. The best seasons were 1 through 5 but this one is pretty good too!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|When you start - it would seem to be usual - however, you will come to understand that the real challenge is to<br />delete as many as possible without moving the view.  It can be done and does really offer a new challenge. Then you<br />get to move on to bigger and better things.<br /><br />APRIL 5---Added Note<br />NOT MOVING THE CUBE IS A FAVORITE
B0042FZOFU|5.0|LOVE  LOVE LOVE the Toy Story series!  He's loved it since he was a toddler!<br />THANKS...THANK  YOU!....THANK  YOU!!!!...Thank  YOU so very much!
B00821OX98|5.0|A sci-fi, alien-invasion, post-apocalyptic adventure with a touch of history thrown in. I think they could use a bit more history, but the show isn't about education but entertainment. Looking forward to the next season.
0345803485|1.0|I didn't even read 50 pages..I was so annoyed by Ana I JUST CAN'T. I do not for the life of me<br />understand how this got to be a best seller. Not wasting any more of my time, and so glad I only<br />got one of the books. Thank God it was FREE.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|To buy some items required to complete assigned tasks you need Gems, which are too difficult to earn so must be purchased. Buying new stables and better horses, especially fanciful mounts like unicorns (yes, unicorns!!) make paying a LOT for Gems mandatory. This is why I took away a star. Otherwise this is an outstanding game, though there needs to be more types of competitions.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I loved this app before. But now with the addition of SwiftKey Flow it is amazing! Flow is way better then the swype that came on my phone and other text apps that I've bought. Worth every penny!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was entertaining. Do I think it's worth paying 5 bucks for though? Probably not. It didn't take but a couple hours to beat. But if you like to blow money, go for it.
B00003CX8V|5.0|If you haven't seen this Billy Wilder classic, I suggest you do.<br />You won't be sorry. It is wonderful with great acting.<br />Sit back and enjoy this beautiful classic.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Awesome CD, great sounds, and mix of dance and ballad styles...getting me through all my moods! Favorite song (and reason for purchasing) was Jump - new twist on an old classic.  A MUST OWN!
B0093ST02E|2.0|Kept waiting for a plot to unfold.  The movie crawled along until the sex scenes started, if you want to sell your acting on sex the move to another genre.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|No complaints on this app.  It does what it needs to do for twitter and is easy enough to navigate.
0143119680|5.0|Not since Harry Potter have I been so entranced by magic. I've read so many novels of supernatural beings but this one earns many points for the witches. I'm really looking forward to reading Shadow of Night now to see what Diana is capable of!
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|First let me say that I have a stable high speed connection and the issue with the quality of picture was not on my end.  The movie is great but the movie buffered at the two most dramatic scenes (plane crash and review board).  After the initial buffering the picture quality went down dramatically.  The picture was blurred and never regained any sign of HD (which I rented at a higher cost).  I checked my computer and other devices to verify internet connection which were great.  We all know what happened.  It was Saturday night and Amazons servers (or whoever they use) were overwhelmed. Come on Amazon, upgrade your technical capabilities.  DO NOT rent on demand during heavy usage such as Friday/Saturday nights when everyone is doing the same. Note:  I have rented other HD movies from Amazon which were great but the viewing times were off peak.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Great season, really great commentary tracks and a new fold-out world map.<br />You need to get this. That is all.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Husband's go to app, best angry birds out there for Star Trek lovers. Each bird has a great trick applicable to the character.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like mystery manor because I like mystery games and i like games where you have to find objects.
B000B8QG22|1.0|This movie was unacceptable half way thru it it skipped continuously and we were unable to watch it...Very poor quality.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed how the characters developed as I read; the plot is definitely original. I'd recommend it as an easy, off the beaten path read.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Who doesn't love the Doctor?<br /><br />Love being able to watch without the commercials.<br /><br />Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!<br /><br />It's been good fun catching up on all the past seasons.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just when you think you know how its going to play you, you are surprised. In between all of my real time commitments, it was nice to get away to something a bit colorful and unpredictable.
B00820N2JG|3.0|This movie was a total ham job.<br /><br />If you take it for what it was, it wasn't a bad movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I had to join in and read this book given that my friends were reading it. I enjoyed it as an easy read.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Every now and then I need to read something that re-teaches me the things I ignored when growing up. This book does that, and more.  Maybe I am naive, but I didn't realize that there has been non-partisan coaching going on behind the scenes of every presidency of modern times.  I am so glad to have read this book.
034580404X|5.0|As a woman I was enticed and excited by the book. We learned a few things and I personal gained some ideas.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case protects my Kindle full-time, unlike the zipper cases that you only use when you're storing your Kindle. The prop is helpful when playing music or using the Kindle as a recipe book in the kitchen. The case if very sturdy and provides a great deal of protection. The strap to secure the flap does a great job as well and hasn't stretched out.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I cannot wait for season 4,  I enjoy the family above and the staff below the staircase.  Maggie Smith makes the whole show even better.
B004W5T2RG|3.0|Overall this movie was good and had an easy storyline to follow. There were some dull parts, but the main actors were good and I would rate it ok.
B002ZG9774|4.0|added to the playlist with other musicals like Chicago and Moulin Rouge.  A bit predictable but enjoyable none the less.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Overall a really great movie. I enjoyed the true story and Affleck was a great actor throughout the entire movie.
B001OL4TR4|5.0|This is one of my favorite fantasy movies of all time and to be honest, in my opinion, perhaps the second best of the two best fantasy movies of the Eighties. The other one being Dragonslayer. The rest of course were pretty awful to forgettable, but this one really stands out.<br /><br />In escaping from the dungeons of Aquila - an unprecedented feat, apparently - Phillipe \\"The Mouse\\" Gaston sets into motion a chain of events that will either result in the saving of a pair of cursed lovers or lead them all to their doom. Along the way he encounters the lovers themselves: The dark and brooding Captain Etienne Navarre (Rutger Hauer in one of his best roles, I think) and Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer). He finds himself eventually encountering the repentant Monk Imperious (played by Leo McKern). The acting in this movie is excellent from beginning to end. Hauer is slightly campy, Pfeiffer has been called 'ethereal' and her line \\"I am sorrow\\" I think is perfectly delivered. Leo McKern as the repentant Monk is by turns grumpy, querulous, wise and funny. Finally Matthew Broderick is entertaining as always.<br /><br />The villains are dark and full of nasty. They may seem a little bit two-dimensional but I think that John Wood (The Bishop of Aquila) and Ken Hutchinson (Marquet) both did very good jobs.<br /><br />The movie is a little slow moving, to be honest and it is very romantic but it should have enough action to hold most peoples attention and much of the scenery is very beautiful.<br /><br />I will not say much about the soundtrack to this wonderful movie: It has been called everything from 'dated' to 'inappropriate' for a medieval fantasy to 'the worst soundtrack ever composed for a movie\\". In the end why it was decided to use Allan Parsons to compose the soundtrack is likely only known to the crew involved in the decision. What I want to say about it is simple: Allan Parsons Project is one of my favorite composer/performer/bands of all time and without this movie I may never have heard of him. 'nuff said about that.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|This movie was good, lengthily and slow in some parts but overall it was a good movie and the actors are is a good in it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good read for inside account. Believable story. Liked the pictures and diagrams at the end of book for visual insight.
B006MQRLSA|4.0|This movie was good, lengthily and slow in some parts but overall it was a good movie and Brad Pitt is a good actor in it.
0670024813|4.0|This book was very different from GG&S and Collapse (and while I have a copy of The Third Chimpanzee I have not read it yet). The theme was a comparison between WEIRD societies and traditional ones. The method was a series of JD's personal stories and experiences as well as other information. Of special interest to me was the chapter on Religion. Still another was the critique of the western diet especially salt, but also behavior that results in different health concerns. Again unlike the other books there did not seem to be a general conclusion following these contrasts. There were specific ones such as regarding the benefits of multilingualism and how languages might be prevented from dying out, and whether or not that was valuable. In short, while it was an interesting read it does not carry the kind of impact I have come to expect from JD though that may very well be because the contrast does not lead to a specific conclusion and making one up would have been fake.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Beautifully written.....a story we could all learn to live by:) A very touching experience. So glad I read this and will share with my kids.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love Mahjong & enjoy playing it.  My only problem is the tablet does't move around very well as the game needs more space.  Sometimes it moved around but can't depend on it.  But, I'm thrilled to have the game on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Thank you!<br />Helen Wylie
B0040I09RM|5.0|my wife and i love the show.  can't wait to watch the other seasons which are also on amazon prime.
B000YJ54DU|3.0|Not Child's best work. A little slow but not horrible. Read it for the sake of continuing Reacher's journey. Nothing more.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|It was funny,but at the same time,there was plenty of drama to keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end
B00574P9EQ|4.0|This is the third &#34;Diary of&#34; movies we've watched as a family.  Really well done, funny, and parents can even relate.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Wow what a fantastic book! Absolutely a must read. This book consumed me. Loved, loved, loved it!!!!!! I can‘t wait until the next one comes out.
B002APU580|5.0|Everything about this film, except that it ends, and it does that well too, is just breathtakingly wonderful. See it.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr Alexander reviews his intense experiences during an out of body coma state which lasted for 7+ days, caused by Gram negative meningitis. During these days he was transported as a spiritual being to the gates of heaven and beyond. Other out of body experiences, including  those of a few few people I have known, have included NDE experiences more commonly related to seeing family members, or observing observing doctors performing resuscitation on their bodies.<br /><br />I have practiced medicine 40+ years in infectious diseases.  Dr Alexander's arguments, as well as the testimonial of his physician, are convincing that a very unusual event occurred. Dr Alexander himself is a neurosurgeon and intimately familiar with the function of the brain neocortex, where higher levels of integrative thought are believed to originate.  His post NDE recollections are lucid.  His refutations of alternative hypotheses (to this experience being reality)are reasonable...though as he noted many of his medical colleagues would disagree.  Especially convincing of the reality of his experience was the NDE encounter with a sister he did not know he had before his NDE. The training and work experience of the author should make this a very hard book to dismiss as the product of a rich imagination or inflammation of the brain.<br /><br />I found one jarring part of this ebook, perhaps related more to the publisher than the author.  Dr Alexander is clearly writing to an audience that, like himself before this experience, is very skeptical of the reality of God. He is writing to reach people.  Today I tried to loan my copy of this book to a friend. Unless I erred, there was no provision for a loan in the book product description.  Dr Alexander is a neurosurgeon.  I doubt this book is written with much view toward personal earnings on his part.  Thus I cannot understand why this book, given the motives for writing, is not available for loan. Of course, perhaps I might have misread the instructions.....
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|Younger kids like this game me it's crazy... I don't have quick responds for this game and it stressful for older people.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham has a way of holding my attention.  For me, I think it's the way he builds several plot avenues, somewhat like a web, with all the outlying characters who surely will play a role in the conclusion (I am thru Ch. 30).  Hoping there's a twist to the ending...my kind of story!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena was an amazing book that I would recommend to other people and especially people who like Greek and Roman stories. I give this book five stars.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am completely drawn into this series! I can't stop reading so addicting!! I have to admit it's my guilty pleasure :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you love Pintrest this is amazing. Its so much easier to use. I'd recommend for anyone who loves Pintrest.
B009K86D86|4.0|Makes you think about what you are eating. Our son was assigned this to watch and review.The whole family watched together.Glad we did.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is lots of fun!! if you get bored with one go to another!!!! you can play for hours!!!!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|pretty good free game, I really like the variety of game modes it gives u to play with,and its also not to easy of a game, I know every person who played it eventually got stuck in one of the levels sooner or later.(@v@)
B0076YCRNG|5.0|As a huge fan of Jazz, Rock, and Psychedelic genres of music, I view this album as a &#34;must have&#34;.  This album was truly a turning point in career of Miles Davis.  Recorded after (and partly inspired by) meeting Jimi Hendrix, and it shows.  Miles is more experimental and the entire album is free-flowing.  If you enjoy this sound, I would also recommend the album &#34;Down On the Corner&#34;.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game<br />_fun and the graphics are cool its free and doesn't take much tocatch on. its any age appropriate
B000MFOMQ6|5.0|The last Byrds album with David Crosby.  The sound is slightly less folky and more rock oriented on tracks, but all and all it has a wonderful feel to it.  Recorded at a point when the L.A music scene was really beginning to shift gears.  I would recommend this album to anyone looking for an open and harmonious sounds paired with rock and psychedelic rhythms and melodies.
B007N85POS|5.0|I like all the Angry Birds but I like this one the best because of the graphics.  the graphics are bright and cheery
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Best James Bond Movie of alllllll time!!!!!! Highly recommend it... So much action that I was tired before the opening credits rolled.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|Not recommended for children and not even teenagers.<br />Poor story.<br />Nothing new or interesting.<br />I was expecting something better.<br />Dissapointed.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever seen and that says alot.  Scary to think pilots like this may be flying me to my final destination.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Dropbox has been around since Christ was a cowboy man! It's awesome! I pity the fool that don't use Dropbox!
B000002AGN|5.0|I very much enjoy all of Brubeck's recordings.  I will add this recording to my record collection.  Keep records coming.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Works pretty well. I would like more volume, but it is better than without it.. It is well built and easy to use.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|It seems the main interest material of the MailOnline Tablet is racy material. Bikini shots of celebrities dominates the coverage of their &#34;news&#34;. It is distracting for those who don't like to see the sexual exploitation of young women advanced.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Very action packed. Tom Cruz is the best actor and made the movie even more interesting to watch.  2nd movies are usually not as good as the 1st ones but this was really good.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|There's no way to give the update zero or even half a star, otherwise I would. I've had this app for about a year, and it was accurate, intuitive, and hassle-free. I especially liked the temperature icon in my status bar, which would change color based on severe weather watches, warnings or advisories. The temperature was always spot-on. THE UPDATE is a billboard with a Weather Channel overlay, and the first ad I experienced was for pickup trucks, with a photo of a pickup. The overlay of the temperature, including any text - e.g. &#34;snow&#34; - was illegible because of the graphics underneath. No temp icon in the status bar. Navigation around the app was cumbersome. It is missing some of the programmable choices for weather notifications. Unfortunately the update could not be uninstalled to the old version, so I had to uninstall the whole thing and look for a different weather app.
0783226845|5.0|I have enjoyed the soundtrack, and I very happy that I was able to order such material when I was unable to order it in stores.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|My comments are regarding the movie and not Amazon Instant Videos.  The Instant Video worked great.  The movie was average at best.  It was slow moving, dull, and the acting was sub-par.  Very disappointed considering the hype.
B00005ASOC|5.0|I have enjoyed this soundtrack, and I was very happy that I was able to order such material when I was unable to find it in stores.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I couldn't wait to read this book but I have to say maybe I was expecting too much.  It was a good read but not as good as people were going on about!!
B00000IQW5|5.0|Feel good movie for everyone.  Good acting.<br />Would be okay for even the smallest child to watch<br /><br />Would recommend buying this.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|good animation movie, i enjoyed it thoroughly with my son. it was captivating thriller cum adventure story of tintin, my first time
B00766CLPI|5.0|I bought this when it first came out on the LP  format  many moons ago and I loved it then, and I love it now as a remastered CD.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun app, my daughter loves it.  she says its fun, she likes to feed the pony.  was buggy at first but seems fine after reinstalling
B001FVV2X2|5.0|short but on to the point fun. I can't wait for season 5 to go free for prime member. If oh well I guess I have to spend some cash...
B0094K1K42|1.0|I really like Charlize Theron, but the movie was so boring that I didn't even finish it.  Not worth watching
B0060AY6FO|5.0|Takes up where Pride and Prejudice left off.  A good plot which keeps you guessing. Very good ending to the story.
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|a great parady for the direction our society is heading, using machines to interact with people instead of doing it physicaly ourselves.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was an interesting and entertaining CD.  I would highly recommend it to you for viewing.<br />Lots of  fun with good characters.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|this is yet another great album from a great artist, her music has power to it, definatly recommend this to anyone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|We read Gone Girl for our Book Club and it was absolutely fantastic!  I couldn't put it down!  The writing is fabulous!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was a very interesting read. I loved the way the names and the meanings of the flowers were incorporated into the Novel. The story line kept me reading. It was hard to put down.
B0095R64AO|3.0|This movie seemed like it lasted forever, it has a really good cast, so I think I was expecting a lot more from it in terms of the movie itself, but there just wasn't enough meat to the movie to make it either super funny or compelling.
B00AW0KHMY|3.0|It does not say in Walmart's description that you will get the extras with the extended part one. It mentions extras on part 2 ONLY. They may have put in this disc mentioned that doesn't have the extra features.<br />Buyer Beware
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|I love the Home Alone movie, yes even the third. But this is one of those great movies that holds up over time, and is really fun for me and my family to watch around the Christmas season. This is the perfect movie when you need a good laugh, and it works for both children and adults.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|My son is addictive to this game. Got his friends hook on it.<br />Enjoys the game.  Great when we go for long trips.
B004MQ9W4I|1.0|Really rather boring. The first PA held my interest and I found the mysterious tone captivating. Not so this one. Yawn. . .
B008J05EL8|5.0|Just like using the product on a computer.<br />Has word excel and power point.  I am keeping track of my daily activities in word and excel.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I never got around to reading this earlier in life , but am so glad that I did finally have the time.  You'll be drawn into the book by the characters  and their dilemmas with life.  Yes, it's from times past, but the nature of mankind hasn't changed. Read it!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Lots of fun and more than just finding hidden objects! Great graphics and a good story line. Scary and creaky.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|This Bond movie was unlike any other Bond movie. James Bond was portrayed as a drunk and Daniel Craig looked  terrible.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Loved it! I'm never disappointed with this show.  There's always an exciting twist or turn. Once you  start watching it you don't want to stop!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. This was an emotional and powerful end to the trilogy of the Hunger Games.
B00AFEY354|5.0|It came in perfect condition. This is my sister's favorite book and we both LOVED the movie. This disc also has many awesome special features that she immediately took advantage of.
0385333846|2.0|When people have raved about a film that was produced by someone who you think you would enjoy, but it just falls flat; it is partly due to the execution and partly due to the expectations.  This novel left me feeling the exact same way.  The whole time I kept thinking if I just get through this next chapter I am sure I will begin to see the magic.  Never happened. The few pages he actually spent on the war were excellent.  The dull sci-fi story that takes up the vast majority of the book were not. I am glad that I have read it, just so I can warn others simply to not get their hopes up.  Then perhaps they can get more out of it than I did.
0321714113|5.0|It was a great book but, You should probably learn some fundamentals for programming if you are just starting out like I was.
B0033RT7RY|5.0|Scary and Horrifying with great special effects and just the right amount of Chills and Thrills! A must see for all Horror Freaks!
B008HK3XKO|2.0|I like the concept of the idea a lot.  But-----------After a couple of weeks or so, it will not stay up when reading the book in an upright position, it keeps sliding down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love being able to customize the card backs. The backgrounds and hints are nice too. Runs smoothly and quickly.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I did like this book and how it became another book half way thru. I did like the changing of the voices from the husband to the wife.But I was disappointed in the ending, as you where just left hanging.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Too simple and kiddish for my liking. Bored after two minutes. Temple Run was the original type of this game and it remains at the top.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|HBO does not disappoint. Second season of Game of Thrones is just as good as the first. The extras are really good. Love the books and the adaptation is superb. As close to the books as one could get, maintaining the most important storylines and characters mostly due to the input of Martin I'm sure. Highly recommended. The price from amazon was unbeatable brand new. Even unbeatable next to used prices!
0596007124|5.0|I am impressed with the amount of work that authors devote to express their material in the &#34;Head First&#34; style of writing. Some &#34;Guru&#34; dialogues were vacuous but it's easy to skip over those.
B0091XRPTQ|5.0|i have allways loved this move ans now i have it on kindle so i can watch it anytime at all
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Having a blast ~ play fast or slow and enjoy destroying the human race ...<br /><br />Kill them all! Infect then protect than kill ...<br /><br />Have fun.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I love this artist. this is great, if you watch the tv show you will love this album too. A
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Icouln't put my kindle down, it was great, very real and suspenseful. We were on Cape Fear a month before it was filmed, so Icould really feel what the island looked like.Sandra Kalmerton
0345529057|5.0|I started out watching the show after the second season while my roommate was reading the first book of the series. I was skeptical to read it at first, but my roommate said I would not regret it and boy was he right. George RR goes in depth into each character that you don't see in the show. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great adventure series.<br /><br />A side note I have only read the first four books. Once I got to the fourth it definately slowed down, which was somewhat expected with how crazy and awesome the third book was. I have begun reading other books to get a change of pace but can't wait to get started on the fifth as I hear it is a lot better than the fourth.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|At last the opportunity to listen to my favorite Cape Cod gardening show on WXTK, Saturdays 8-10. used the app on my IPad and was gleefully happy to be able to use it on my cell phone.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Loved this book, could not put it down.<br />It was an enjoyable read from start to end, and a great nostalgia trip.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great book love Kami Garcia's style of writing I will be sad when their story is finished. I wish the movie was as good.
0756407125|5.0|Takes off where the first book left off, and just as good.  I can't wait for book three to come out.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|I was entertained throughout the movie but it didn't seem to build on the characters enough to make me care.. At the end, I felt like...eh.
B000002KOO|5.0|This is a most fascinating album to listen to. Unbelievably I hadn't heard much of the early Mac stuff until about a month ago. Now I am enthralled with it. I played it though three times straight making sure I heard what I thought I heard. The last album with Peter Green; notwithstanding, this is Danny Kirwan's opus. Would \\"Oh Well\\" be the rock classic is without DK's blistering Les Paul runs? The true PG gem is \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\". It's just nasty and way too short. The two guitar attack on this record makes me want to compare it to the Allman's; especially, the \\"Madge\\" jams. But it goes to another place with \\"Although the Sun is Shining\\" and \\"My Dream\\". There are better songs here than anything on the Stones mid period run with Mick Taylor although not being as great as a whole. Green's shoestrings are unraveling and it shows in most of his songs but what could have been with Kirwan and Green continuing to riff off each other for a few more LP's?
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This periood piece is extremely well done, and full of heart warming stories. Beautiful cinematography. Already watching season 2. I am addicted!
B009MF56GC|3.0|I really enjoyed the first Expendable movie.  I expected the 2nd one to be atleast somewhat decent.  The plot was horrible, didn't make much sense, the acting was horrible compared to the first one.  This will be 90 minutes I will NEVER get back.  I wasted $8 buying this on blu ray, thought to myself, what a great price, now I know why....it was a really bad movie...
B009WO7NQO|4.0|this is yet another great game from rovio includes lots of content.<br />this game includes levels that are fun and challenging, the graphics are amazing I love the way the birds progress as you do<br /><br />however I was kind of upset with the lack of power ups<br />thanks for reading
B005LAII1C|5.0|How can people not laugh when watching this movie?  So many people get offended when they watch a movie like this.  Do they not realize it's a movie, and it's designed to make people laugh.  People need to chill out more, and not get so offended all the time.  I've survived cancer, jokes about cancer don't offend me at all.  I remember getting treatments with people, and we all cracked jokes about cancer, would that offend you?  So what that this movie cracks jokes about cancer, people who have cancer crack jokes about cancer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|LOVE this series! I watched all 3 seasons in a matter of days after work and after my son was in bed. Disappointed with the ending but still looking forward to season 4!
B004LWZW4W|2.0|The best way to talk about this movie:  bad movie, great special effects.....the plot/story was horrible, give me a break....
B00ATPVA78|2.0|not crazy about this game not enough information to guide you thru, would not choose it again as kindle game
B009AMANH4|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out, and I can't wait for it to come out on blu ray!  I order did my preorder.  I'm so glad Daniel Day-Lewis won for best actor.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|You get what you're expecting, a pretty standard yet overall decent dungeon crawler. As with all games that are free to play, you can get better gear etc by shelling out cash for credits, but it's more of a challenge to earn your gear.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|This episode diverges from the gravitas of the earlier ones, but the actors put on a good show.  Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) makes the movie tick with his deadpan humor.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Just too boring..More for a 5 year old.. Needed something more challenging  I'm glad it was free.  Next case please
B007N5YIUS|3.0|Is it the Amazon Appstore, the update or my tablet's fault? The download finishes, but the update says the game's NOT installed. Tried three times... I give up.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it every fun n good way to waste time. I play at work and at home my husband likes it toonn my son Aldo plays
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Even though the story lines are over-the-top, the characters and the acting ring true.  There is this &#34;catch-22&#34; aspect where things that are quirky, even outrageous, when presented, two or three or ten episodes later come into context and are logical.  It is therefore an advantage to watch episodes in order so that the larger story becomes apparent..
B000M02M2M|5.0|I bought these for my 1-year old. She (so far) has not broken them. The colors are true, and she (so far) has been unable to make a mess with them.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|So simple to install and use it is an unexpected surprise.  Recommend this for Android users or anyone that likes to read and not hold a fragile book.  Book marking is a breeze.
B0030B624E|5.0|This is a hilarious movie. Must-see. It's as funny the 5th time as the 1st time. Love Woody Harrelson especially.
B0086700CM|5.0|Good graphics, original concept and gameplay.  There are upgrades for your player and more characters to unlock, plus the game gives you incentive to keep playing because you try to complete tasks, which get more and more difficult.  Truly addictive.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|This was supposed to work with my printer, but it does not. It sees my printer on the network, but it does not have a driver for it and there is no option to acquire the driver somewhere. Pretty much the least useful app ever.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I am amazed that an app used with touch screen can do so much. Now I can manipulate photos on the kindle that I used to have to do on the pc then transfer. This app saves time and is lots of fun to use with all the effects etc.
1608862801|5.0|I enjoyed this book extremely. The story is very fun and there are many, many funny bits to appreciate. It also has some bonus things to throw in with the issues. I'm definitely going to read it again soon. Don't have second thoughts about buying this, it's totally worth every cent!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Had trouble with kindle email retrieval and send function. Once i had this app those problems disappeared. I am very happy with yahoo mail!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is surreal and I enjoy watching it every single time. It's one of the best movies I've seen because it's so original and well-written.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|So disappointed that it is over.  I loved everything about it.  Watch the last series on TV.  Highly recommend it
0785132619|5.0|I've read this book twice since receiving it and I really like it. It has a lot of violence but that's what makes the name of the book relevant. I give this two thumbs up!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It started off slow but about half way through I never wanted to put it down....Gray is a character! I must know what happens next...
B006OAB2XO|4.0|I've listened to this album many times and it is very good. It wears off after a while but it's still worth the purchase. My favorite song is probably &#34;Circumambient.&#34;
B00APJLFEG|5.0|this movie has an all star cast, excellent story, and  just overall awesomeness!! any fan of old school horror will appreciate the new light these monsters are seen under.. and any adam sandler fan will be laughing the whole time
B00AECGQF2|4.0|The graphics on this game are great.... you can do so many things with it.  Even my 19 years daughter likes to play it.
3836504715|5.0|Atget is one of the masters and this edition is a great value.  Nice quality book, good reproduction of photos, price is terrific.  This is a fun book for browsing and I find that I like his work more the more time I spend with it.  Some photography books are great for checking out of a library, this one is worth having on your own bookshelf if you are interested in great photographers and their work.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I usually do not see Disney's movies but everybody was talking about this one and I gave it a try. It is really good, the message is inspiring and it shows how far mom's love and protection can go.<br /><br />The quality of the picture was great and the sound really great actually. Before to buy it I thought to get the version for BR but this DVD version is all that I needed, really great.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I find myself often thinking about this book. The narrative is written with such a sense of immediacy and intimacy that it is not always easy to peep through the pages at what Pi is going through, yet it uplifts instead of leaving the reader in despair. Extraordinary story and brilliant writing. I am scared to see the movie as the book rates of one of my favorites!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love hidden object games. This one is put together very well. The graphics are awesome. You will enjoy it.
B002TXZRRM|5.0|It is a rare gift to combine fiction with quotable extracts about life. Alexander Smith hit a nerve when he created Precious, her supporting characters, and the setting of the book. Living on the other side of the Kalahari Desert in the Northern Cape of South Africa, I find the description of the setting, the customs of the people and the cultural quirks in the book authentic and enjoyable. Well worth a read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have been told many good things about this game and I loved it the minute I started playing on it.
B00684J49U|5.0|Couldn't be happier, it was brand new, but bought used. Bought it for my wife, and earned some brownie points.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I found Temple Run 2 wonderfully challenging and highly addictive! THANK YOU,Imangi studios!  Way to vamp up such an enjoyable experience.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've tried several options with my Kindle Fire HD, and this has been, by far, the most functional and practical battery saver.  Love it.  Good job, developers!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book the emotion sucked me in and the action kept me interested trough out the story i strongly recommend this
B008Y6WPXC|1.0|Just thought it was stupid didn't like at all.  Bunch of old men trying to be tough guys.  no good
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Great book  makes you stop and think the way things are right now in real life if something like this could happen in the future.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|A great conversion/Immersion into 3D. This allows you to feel like you were on board the RMS Titanic on it's one, and ill-fated voyage.
B000001GQQ|5.0|This was the debut on disc in a concerto performance for Martha Argerich, and it is as stunning to hear today as it was in 1966.  That's not to say that there aren't other fine recordings of both these pieces out there, but this is as good as any.  First of all, in the Prokofiev the sheer facility of the fingerwork is marvelous, and despite the fast tempo and motoric character of some of the passagework, she never sounds as if she's banging anything out.  The piano tone is always appealing, so the energy is just invigorating to listen to.  There are moments that gesture towards lyricism, but as I see it, this concerto is all about what the piano and the pianist can do (Prokofiev was no mean pianist himself), and it doesn't express much beyond that.  In other words, I don't believe that Argerich and Abbado fail to express something that's there.  There are times when I think the orchestra, and particularly the strings, need to be more in the aural picture -- the Ravel seems better balanced in this regard -- but that's not a huge negative for me.  The heart of the disc is the slow movement of the Ravel -- it is absolutely beautifully played here, and in the second half of it is almost more of a wind concerto as (I'm guessing) Karlheinz Zoller and Alfred Prinz are given their heads, and Argerich plays a beautifully rippling supporting role -- even then the chamber musician was part of her makeup.  The Ravel finale, with plenty of presence from the orchestra, is as invigorating as the Prokofiev.  \\"Gaspard\\" was not part of the original recording -- it has been added for this reissue, and it's as good as any in the catalogue, though I tend to think Pogorelich's account is especially outstanding.  But make no mistake -- this is, as they say, the real deal.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Have used this app for two years, now. Its a great app for info storage. Would prefer folder organization, but info is easy to find.
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|Watch the fine print on the digital copy that is included w The Hobbit.  There is no iTunes file included with the UltraViolet digital copy.<br />This is a sneaky practice intended to deceive the customer and it lessens the value of the purchase.  Be warned.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I thought this movie was awesome in the theater, so I know it will be SUPER awesome in 3D!  Get the glasses out honey!!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|JJ Abrams is phenominal. This show has the same smartness to it that Lost does. The more you pay attention the more you see all the intelligence that goes into his writing. Every single cast member is crisp and draws you in. There are many I am sure that could poke all kinds of holes in the science, but it is TV - for those that want to play negativity. If you are looking for entertainment and a show that sticks with you between episodes, you have found another in the likes of Lost, Sopranos, 24 and Damages. Just good solid TV entertainment.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|i am infatuated with this artist for the time being. If you love Eerie soul, hip hop music that keeps you wondering, then he is definitely it!!

B006HL9G10|5.0|Lots of optional bell sounds and various ways to use the timer.  Nice app that works well with music running in the background.
B009CF7JDU|3.0|Not a very good take on parenthood and sort of makes them look dumb.  Wrecking dad's car and all is not sending a good message.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|my daughter told me how she was so addicted to this game so I had to try it.  love it and I am just as addicted as my daughter!  I recommend this if you love a strategic game of placing coins to get prizes and more coins!
B005VPRETE|5.0|Once again this was a gift to my eight year old granddaughter. She absolutely loves these legos. I will probably buy her all the sets. It is so much fun to watch her joy while she plays with the sets. Sturdy last a lifetime.  Some small pieces
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Great movie.  Let the buyer beware:  the special features listed are almost entirely just on the Blu-Ray.  The DVD just has a short documentary.  It was disappointing to us since we bought the combo to get the special features. I could be blind or dumb (probably), but I didn't see that specified anywhere. Loved the movie.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|the reason I can not rate is that I have never used this product. Have not use this product not used

B005QKYIZ2|5.0|Really liked this CD, i have the itunes but wanted to make sure i had the hard copy as well.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Good Show for Adults and Older Teens -<br />This is something different - A Horror Show<br />Good special effects, some might not be for those who don't like horror shows or movies (blood and other things)
