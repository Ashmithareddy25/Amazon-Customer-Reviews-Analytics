B005K0HDGE|5.0|I enjoyed the premise of this book.  It portrayed the historical and political times in the past in comparison to current times.  The result of tampering with past history shown in the story was thought provoking.  This would make a good movie if done correctly.  I thought the epilogue showed thoughtful consideration and research.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This show is so clever and funny.  I love all the characters, they're so unique!  Great acting and what a great start for this new serie!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel is a great source to check before heading out in the morning.  Have found it to be very helpful in planning events.
0553801473|4.0|I'm writing this review specifically because of all the poor reviews and low marks I've seen this book given here on Amazon.  I've read all the Song of Ice and Fire books, and certainly books 4 Feast for Crows was rather poor,  particularly in comparison to the first three.  So I agree with those who panned that book.  I found it unsatisfying and way too Cerci heavy.<br /><br /> But I was very happy with Dance, which seemed to strike out in new directions,  taking  the reader to new places both within the physical universe of Martin's world and the narrative.  Perhaps he made some choices, and took some directions that I might not have if I were writing the story, but on the whole the book seemed fresh and inspired.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I love this movie, I loved the first two in this series as well.<br />This was a gift for my husband for Christmas and it was the first movie that we ended up watching.  We both love Christian Bale as Batman and thinks he plays the part great.
B00821OW8K|5.0|I haven't watched actual \\"TV\\" since buying my Roku almost a year ago.  I found this series on Amazon and OH BOY did I enjoy it!  First, Will Patton is one of my favorite actors so this was a must see; second, Noah Wyle is a wonderful actor and that was a further enticement; last, but not least, I'm a huge post-apocalyptic fan (no vampires or zombies, though, ugh).  I was never, not once, disappointed.  I watched both seasons, one after the other, for a week (during my free time).  Fantastic!  I highly recommend it.
B003Y5H556|3.0|This is an okay movie to watch. It's nothing to boast about, but it's nothing I would sit and complain that I wasted 2 hours of my life over either.<br /><br />I will most likely watch again when I want a move to play in the background, like when I'm ironing, folding clothes, or cleaning.
B009X01GJ2|4.0|Be careful while watching a video and laying down.  The heavy Kindle Fire slipped forward out of the case and busted my lip!  Took several days to heal.
B004A8ZX2I|5.0|I bought this Blu-ray for a Christmas gift on a whim.  It is much better than either of us thought it would be.  It had nice surprises to it and had me thinking for the majority of the movie.  It has some re-watch value to it, but I will have to wait until the plot is not as clear in my mind so I can still be surprised by a few of the turns!
B00354YA4A|4.0|I am reading this book on my Kindle but also listening to the Talking Book from Vision Australia.  I belong to the Book Group in this Retirement Village and I keep up with the others who can read a print edition this way.  Atonement is this month's choice.  Last month was 'Help' and I truly loved it having lived in the USA 1950/51 in what was considered the integrated north (Ohio and Michigan) but found many instances of colour distinctions.  All these years later I can hardly beleive a coloured President  two times round.
B006TTC54A|4.0|They did a nice job of converting this to a blu ray.  Much better than some of the other 'older' movies out there.  The picture and sound really turned out great in this blu ray edition of &#34;The Blues Brothers&#34;<br />My husband loved this gift.

B0042EJD8A|5.0|I knew the dangers and horrors of fracking and the natural gas industry's corruption- but I did not realize the extend of it until watching this film.  This is a must see for all of humanity.  Watch and share!  The industry tried to respond, but only looked worse after replying. The film maker's answer to their response goes even further.  Just as the big tobacco companies lied about the dangers of smoking and nicotine, the natural gas world is lying about their impact on our water and ecosystems (and health!). Watch and share before it is too late!

B007V65R54|5.0|I've loved Nate Silver's analysis for years, and this book doesn't disappoint.  This might seem like a relatively niche product, but it's not.  Anyone interested in policy, sports, or any number of other topics should read this.
1449325947|5.0|If you are just learning CSS and even HTML, this is a great beginner book. It explains the role of HTML and CSS and how to create stylesheets and take advantage of inheritance and cascading. It then walks you through numerous examples of styling various parts of a web page. Each chapter ends with one or more tutorials that you can apply in day-to-day web design. Toward the end of the book you learn to create page layouts and float-based layouts, use media queries, and develop responsive websites. Everything is written clearly and wonderfully. If you are a beginner, don't hesitate to purchase it.<br /><br />If you know CSS and just looking for what's new in CSS3, you're not the intended audience and would probably be better off buying an example-driven book specifically for what's new in CSS3 and event HTML5. There are numerous books out there that are less narrative and more to-the-point at highlighting new features in CSS3.

B009IJJ5B4|1.0|I am a Sherlock fan. I've read Arthur Conan Doyle. I enjoy Jeremy Brett in his series, and the new British Sherlock is wonderful. This show began and I was disgusted. Not a fan at all.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It is an interesting premise and well written. I enjoyed the alternating perspectives of the husband and wife. The ending was a little disappointing.
B000002JSJ|4.0|NOTE: I copied and pasted this review (which I wrote) from a review that I wrote for my local library.<br /><br />This release, the 7th of the band's eight studio albums (nine, if you include \\"Coda\\" released after the death of John Henry Bonham (drummer), and the break-up of the band) is often overlooked by some fans. However, while I would argue that this may not be the band's most cohesive and 'even' release (track to track), it does contain some tracks that are (or should) be considered as signature 'Zeppelin pieces - every bit as much as \\"Whole Lotta Love (Zeppelin II)\\", \\"Black Dog\\" (Led Zeppelin IV), \\"Since I've Been Loving you\\" (Led Zeppelin III), or \\"Custard Pie\\" (Physical Graffiti). What's interesting (to me) is how, with the advent of the internet, the lyrics for these songs are now available - quite different than 'way back when', and without liner notes, one simply had to guess at the lyrics. I say 'interesting' because I can now actually understand some of the lyrics - in start contrast to when I first heard this record (likewise for other 'Zeppelin releases); I can now see the humor, anguish, isolation, or whatever other themes borne out in these tracks - I'll try to cover those (at least, based solely on my interpretation).<br /><br />If you stop and think about where the Band members 'were' when this record was recorded (in approximately three weeks' time), it's hard not to see it as a watershed moment for them; they were arguably the world's biggest band at the time (for better or worse), and in some ways, the 'worse' was taking its toll on the band members' lives. Page's experimentation with heroin had morphed into an addiction, and Bonham's drinking (long excessive) had grown even worse. Thus, from a health perspective (as well as emotional well-being) this very well might have been the low point (or the start of a prolonged low point) for the band, at least, according to various interviews with the surviving band members. Indeed, Plant sang most of these tracks from his wheelchair, while recovering from an automobile accident in Greece (When I first posted this review I had erroneously said, referring to the accident \\"that left his son dead - talk about living in the shadow of something dark...I am amazed that he could even find the motivation and focus\\". However, I was wrong, though Robert sustained serious injuries as a result of said automobile accident; Plant's wife Maureen, was also injured,and hospitalized for treatment. The Plant's lost their son Karac not as a consequence of the accident, but rather due to a viral infection around two years after the incident in Rhodes).<br /><br />The track listing is as follows - I'll try to give a brief description of each:<br /><br />1) Achilles Last Stand<br />2) For Your Life<br />3) Royal Orleans<br />4) Nobody's Fault But Mine<br />5) Candy Store Rock<br />6) Hots On For Nowhere<br />7) Tea For One<br /><br />\\"Achilles Last Stand\\": Hmmm...well, I have to say that this is a huge, sprawling track. (Jimmy) page purportedly overdubbed something like nine individual guitar parts to make this come together, but like a lot of Zeppelin's tracks, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It's also one of the longest songs in the canon and features a cyclical nature, that is, the track fades in (at the start) and out (at the end) with Bonham performing essentially the same phrasing on the drum kit. This is a thunderous track, and you can see where a song like this, played as it is (great performances from all, but especially the drumming, which is (for rock), mighty impressive) and with its allegorical lyrics, it does sort of conjure-up some other worldliness. While in production, Page (who oversaw most of the production for this release) used Vari-speed, and the previously mentioned overdubs to come up with the wall of guitar parts. Page has been quoted as saying that he feels this track is every bit as good as \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" (love it or hate it...it's anicon), and that when experimenting with the production, he decided to do the exhaustive guitar over-dubbing; initially, most of the band members thought that he had 'gone mad', but as Page has stated, upon hearing it, they understood his musical vision for the piece. Overall, this track is probably as technically involved and challenging to play as just about any other high point in the catalog. Very, very impressive. If, perchance, you play the drums...you'll want to give this one a listen.<br /><br />For Your Life: If I'm interpreting this correctly, this is effectively a song about a guy whose significant other is struggling with what appears to be a formidable addiction to drugs, most probably cocaine. This is also borne out by the lore about this song, several sources of which say that Plant wrote the lyrics in reference to a girlfriend that he once had (and if you listen very closely right around the 5:30 mark in the song, you can hear the sound of someone performing an exaggerated 'snort', so it sounds logical enough). Musically, a very interesting tune. As if often the case, the rests in a piece are often as important as the beats...and that is definitely the case here - it gives the track a very herky-jerky rhythm, and Bonham (drums) and Jones (Bass) are in dead-on lockstep in these beats. Interesting guitar work here as well as Page uses what certainly sounds like a whammy-bar, though to be fair and honest, I'm not sure which guitar(s) he used for this track.<br /><br />\\"Royal Orleans\\": Early in the review, I mentioned the humor that, until realizing the lyrics, had long been lost on me. What we have here is a song about a guy who, by circumstance or deed, picks up a call girl, only to find out that she's a man. This track is purportedly based on a true story (this happened to John Paul Jones) when the band were living it up in New Orleans, and according to lore, was the name of a hotel in which the Band liked to stay. There appears to be some truth to this as Plant used to joke about this tune during live shows, specifically in reference to Jones. Back to the humor - there's a lyric in the song that goes \\"When I step out, strut down with my sugar, She'd best not talk like Barry White!\\". Still, setting the humor aside, the musicianship is really good here - great guitar riffs and phrasing, and Bonham's drumming is replete with a relaxed yet focused swing to it.<br /><br />\\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\": Just wonderful drumming here...heavily syncopated, and some really, really good harmonica riffs laid down by Plant. 'Zeppelin 'borrowed' heavily from American blues musicians, and I have read (though have not substantiated) that this is actually a cover of a Blind Willie Johnson tune; still others say it's a Robert Johnson tune...or an Otis Redding tune...I can't say, but what I can say is that this is a great tune that, like most tracks on this, feature some great cohesive playing. Lyircally, it's great fun as Plant uses a faux-stutter to emphasize certain lyrics and diminish others. A great tune, and again, largely overlooked by fans and critics alike. Stories abound as to the theme or inspiration for this, but the most logical seems to be that Plant wrote this after having developed an addiction to pain killers (prescribed after a serious car accident in Greece, which killed Plant's son, and put him in a wheelchair for part of his recovery). Regardless of the theme...or the subject for that matter, here's another one that is very high energy, and as the kids say (or once said), \\"rocks\\".<br /><br />\\"Candy Store Rock\\" : In many ways, this tune's sound telegraphed what was to come on \\"In Through the Out Door\\", specifically, \\"Hot Dog\\". However, in contrast to Hot Dog, which was (in my opinion) somewhat tongue-in-cheek, Candy Store Rock really has its roots in true Rockabilly; you can hear Plant channeling Elvis on this one, but more specifically, the slap-back echo so prevalent in early Elvis (and other rockabilly) recordings is likewise rendered here. Rockabilly was always an important (and shared) experience for most of the band members (in particular Page, influenced by British skiffle, itself arguably a derivative of American Rockabilly) and Plant, for whom Elvis was always an iconic singer). In fact, the band were known (especially shortly after having formed and thus, not having all that much original material to play) to cover songs by the likes of Eddie Cochran (\\"Summertime Blues\\", \\"Somethin' Else\\" et al) and others like him. As far as subject matter, lyrically, and 'conceptually', I would say that this is pretty close to the subject matter of another raucous 'Zeppelin classic, \\"Custard Pie\\". According to some 'sources', Plant considers this as one of his favorite 'Zeppelin songs, and according to still other 'sources', Plant felt that this song, and \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" were the only 'strong' vocal performances on \\"Presence\\". I have to disagree though (if this is in fact true) as I find much of the vocals on display elsewhere on the album to be really, really good.<br /><br />\\"Hots On For Nowhere\\": Like \\"For Your Life\\", the musical phrasing here is herky-jerky, but very, very catchy. I can't even tell you why, but I love the timbre of the guitars achieved here. Yes, I love the phrasing, but it's the timbre that grabs my ear...and never lets go. If I'm not mistaken, there's more whammy-bar work around the 2:18 mark. I find the rhythm and lead phrasing here really, really fun. Some (in forums etc) have said this is Zeppelin's worst song, but I just can't agree with that - for me, that distinction goes to \\"Dancing Days\\" (on \\"Houses of the Holy\\", an album, I otherwise love). Lots of reverb (and some echo) on the guitars here, which fatten them out nicely. Lyrically, another interesting song. According to some 'sources', this was written by Plant as a thinly-veiled attack on Page and (Peter) Grant, the Band's Manager whom he flet were not sensitive to Plant's aesthetic desires and visions for the Band. That may be all conjecture (a polite word for BS), but whether about Page and Grant, there is an interesting self-Bowdlerization of the lyrics; Plant sings about \\"friends who would give me fluck-all\\", apparently as a way to get the song past the U.S. radio censors. Whether that part is true seems inconsequential. Again, it's an indicator as to where the Band members were 'in their heads' while making this record, so whether it was directed at them, or someone else in general matters not...but the frustration felt by the singer comes across.<br /><br />\\"Tea For One\\": Even the first time I heard this, I could not help but think that it was derivative of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" (on Led Zeppelin III), one of my favorite ballads ads from the band. While not a musician, I have read that both tunes (TFO and SIBLY) are basically 12-bar blues written in C-minor, so maybe this explains why both tunes affect me in similar ways. Yes, this is a simple blues, but like most well-executed blues, I find this tune really affects me - it's both sad and beautiful all at once. To this day, it affects me emotionally every time that I hear it, and while nowhere near as complex as some of the other tunes on this release (or other 'Zeppelin releases), it still affects me. I like this to good film-making; in the end, I may not be crazy about what the film says (i.e. its message), but if it affects me, and makes me think about what I have just seen, then it's a success in my book. Such is the case here. Again, given the choice, SILBY is my preferred 'version' of this theme, but at the same time, it also fits what the band members were struggling with at the time. It's dark haunting, and somber...and everything in it - from the drumming and bass, to Plant's vocals...to Page's guitar phrasing and timbre, convey this emotion to me. Clearly, we have to consider frame of reference - Obviously the Band are British, and let's face it - for the Brits, tea is as much aboutstructure as it is a set-aside time for social interaction. The idea of tea for one conveys, at least to me, the idea of loneliness and isolation - and it certainly comes across in the feel of the tune...but I suspect that this is very much what Plant was feeling when he penned these lyrics.<br /><br />In summary, like I said, I don't see this as the band's most 'uniform' or 'even' effort. However, if you factor-in what each band member was struggling with while making this recording, I think it informs the recordings, and makes this pretty much akin to a time capsule for the band - where it was, where it was going, and in fact, just how (precious) little time they had left.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really, really liked this bok!  This isn't the book that I am taking about in my last post, that comes tomorrow.  This was a cute, funny, and sexy Harlequin read.<br /><br />Book Description from harlequin.com<br /><br />Her first thought: \\"Who are you?\\"<br />It's the morning after her cousin's bachelorette party in Vegas and Megan Scott wakes up with the mother of all hangovers. Even worse, she's in a stranger's penthouse having woken up with something else as well--a funny, arrogant, sexy...husband!<br />Up until now, finding even a boyfriend had seemed impossible--been there, got the broken heart, swore off men for good. Then a few martinis with Carter...no, Connor Reed and she's gone from first meet to marriage in one night!<br />Megan wants a lawyer. But Connor's shocking bombshell?<br />\\"I don't want a divorce.\\"<br /><br />Megan Scott wakes up after a drunken night in Vegas (haven't we all!) and learns that she has married Connor Reed.  Right away she plans out they way to fix it and get a divorce quickly because Megan is a planner but Connor doesn't want one.  He knows he's perfect for he because he believes they share the same ideals.  He believes they both can be in a loveless but committed marriage.  He truly believes this will work and neither of them will fall in love with one another.  Right.....<br /><br />It was great to see these two fight their attraction and feelings for one another.  I loved when Connor finally realized is plan was flawed.  This is a great book that shows how plans don't always happen they way you want them too.<br /><br />I give this book a 4 out of 5! Read it. You'll love it.<br /><br />previously posted on agirlandherloveforbooks.blogspot.com

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was freaking amazing. Started off slow but picked up fast. I love Hoover's writing style. Took awhile to get used to the present tense writing but it doesn't affect the book. Overall a superb read! One of my favorites now!!

1563898586|3.0|I read this after reading two other comics by Alan Moore, From Hell and Watchmen, and it does not stack up to either of those stories. High expectations were further raised by my particularly love with 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, where Capt. Nemo is from. It was great seeing him and the Nautilus in this tale, but when the volume finished, I was left unsatisfied. The villain was forgettable and character growth was minimal. It wasn't what I've come to expect from Moore.
B000B5XOXY|5.0|other than batman & robin (which i don't even consider a batman movie) this is definately the worst batman movie but i watched this movie so much that i love it<br />1.

I have both seasons  and can't wait for season 3. We in America love BBC television too.

B007F7QG0Y|5.0|The book I received was in excellent  shape. Not any wear I could tell. I had already read the book before but I lent it to someone and did not get it back. Keith Richards is a great storyteller. He writes about stuff that he really knows. I especially liked the early history and his comments on his family and home. I also liked his comments about chords and the sound of some of the songs he created. He seems like the kind of guy you'd like to chat with at the pub. No airs about him, a regular joe and seems very different in character to Mick Jagger. In all honesty I did not want the book to end. I hope he writes another soon.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I wasn't sure if old Harry Bosch would still have it but Michael Connelly proves, once again, that he is in top form. I discovered the Harry Bosch series a few years ago and it quickly became an all consuming mission. I think my marriage even suffered from it but I just could not put this series down. Everytime I read another book I just got sucked further into the seedy world of Hollywood Homicide. Gracefully, within a years time, I had read them all and was able to go back to living my life.<br /><br />When The Black Box was released a few months ago, I didnt jump right into it. I was reading other things at the time and, like anything in life, time had quieted my Bosch addiction. Well, I finally finished my other projects and decided last week to dive into this book...2 days later, I have my life back and it is finished. If I had questions regarding Connelly's ability to keep the series fresh, they were answered.<br /><br />I wont go into summary details but Connelly gives Bosch a crack at a cold case...a murder during the L.A. Riots...a 20 year old homicide that appears to just be the result of unfortunate riot violence. Of course, once Harry digs in, he discovers that there is much more to it and he ends up risking life and career in an effort to solve the crime and uncover the conspiracy surrounding it. Connelly opens the book with a flashback to the riots and Harry is off and running from there...it is a brilliant opening.<br /><br />If you haven't read this series, I really cannot give it a high enough rating. Connelly's style is laser focused and really really detailed. Bosch is not just a detective...he has depth, deep flaws, and character. Start at the beginning and let Connelly take you on this journey. When you get to The Black Box you will discover a book that is as good as any in the series.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Very heartbreaking book yet wonderfully written. My heart goes out to Jaycee & her family. I would recommend this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It is easy to play. I can play it offline. It's like I have a horse of my own.
B00881PPTO|1.0|This was the free app of the day (which is the only reason I got it) but there was just way too much going on with the app (as is the design and layout - NOT the functionality of it). The search works, but there's too much clutter on the screen/search and it's just not easy on the eyes nor a pleasant searching experience. It's just way easier to use Kayak on the computer or tablet then on a smart phone.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game it is so easy to understand. I can play the game when I am offline or online.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Just enough variety to keep even an adult entertained. Not overly easy but not so hard that it is difficult to play.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This movie brought back the flavor of the original Bourne movie. I was only hoping for it to keep going so I could see where else these characters went.
140053271X|4.0|first time I use e ink book.<br />I did not know what to look for in the nook.<br />I love the basic idea of it but I i wish I got the one with light function.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|FIVE STARS FOR SURE. ONCE YOU START YOU CAN'T PUT IT DOWN! THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I READ THIS AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY AGSIN!

B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an awesome game!! I love it. It work wonderful on my kindle fire. Would recommend it to everyone!:)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for people who love/like horses.  I know that I like this game because  I love horse so much.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I considered purchasing the paid version of this app but decided to try the free version first,<br />I honestly have had no problems with the adds and really think it's just as good as the paid version!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's an okay game. They could make it a little more hands on. You know like, you groom the horse yourself or something.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like the app and it usually works how it should but I have noticed two very distinct problems<br /><br />1. I frequently get 'Facebook has Stopped' and the app restarts<br />2. It sometimes does not connect to the internet despite my email and web browser working fine.<br /><br />I think this is a great app that could use  a bit more work to get rid of the glitches and then it's really just Facebook for your Kindle.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's great I absolutely love this game it's so much fun thanks for making it I especially like the little ponies their so cute
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Well, prior to watching this flick, I heard tons & tons of folks talking about how great it was so I knew I'd watch it soon enough. I did not read the book-only watched the movie...finally....<br /><br />Wont go in to too much detail or post any spoilers ( I see now several reviews did indeed post 'spoliers'..& congrats to those who let people know there were spoilers & epic fail to those who didnt inform folks there were major spoilers in their review....Im so glad I did NOT read the reviews from folks who gave major spoilers until after the fact & feel terrible for those who did read the spoilers prior to watching as some reviews were an epic fail in that they gave away the major spoliers, effectively ruining the flick for those who read the spoilers prior to watching the flick....{I'd think most folks would know to label their review so folks know there are spoilers, but obviously some reviewers are just clueless to the fact they they will ruin any movie by telling folks the surprises/spoilers prior to folks watching it}...& thats the end of my 'spoiler rant')....<br /><br />I thought the movie was quite good...I do wish they had added about 45min to it keeping it right under 3hrs so they could better develop things, but it still was a good flick for those who didnt read the book or really knew much about the movie....<br /><br />The acting was top notch by all characters. The scenery was quite nice. The plot very interesting.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed the flick & would give it 5 stars but im giving it 4 for a simple reason. Although the ending was just fine...to me, it left me feeling a bit hollow...I wont spoil it for anyone, but I just felt that when the movie ended, 'I wanted more'...& will leave it at that so as to not give anything away. I was expecting a different ending & could think of quite a few scenarios for the ending I would have enjoyed much more without leaving me with the slight 'I want more' feeling, but I digress & will simply say the ending was fine as it was & the movie itself was quite good.<br /><br />Anyway, I do rec folks watch it & certainly hope those that do enjoy it as much as I did.ng was fine as it was & the movie itself was quite good.<br /><br />Anyway, I do rec folks watch it & certainly hope those that do enjoy it as much as I did.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really good because I love horses and love them and they are really cool horses horses horses horses
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I can't stop reading until I finish every time. Riordan never has failed and I can't wait until his next book comes out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|AWESOME ! My only complaint is the Pins that were recently removed but then again, I needed someone to &#34;thin my pins&#34; so to speak. I only would like to know what they were or a brief discription of them. I encourage people everyday to join Pinterest.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|No spoilers here.<br />Well first off it's a great idea,the backdrop is really, really cool. The only problem is, it dosent flow very well, starts great, then gets slow and starts to meander for a while, then finally picks up towards the end.<br /><br />Overall a good read, just don't expect \\"Epic Dystopian Doom\\".<br />It is a good book for casual reading, you can read for a while, put down for a month, then pick back up and you wont be lost trying to remember who is who or what is what.<br /><br />All that aside, I do recommend it for fans of post apocaliptic, dystopian, sci-fi, even alternate reality.<br /><br />(Edit 1/23/13):<br />On sitting back on it after a few days, and digesting it, it really is a good story. I still have a problem with the lack of research on some subjects, but eh, big deal just read it, you'll like it.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|A well thought through plot with multiple lines merging into one and building to a finale filled with suspence/tension. Awesome!
0307716546|4.0|A mother rushes into a burning building to save her teenage daughter who is trapped on the top floor : both are seriously injured and it is the mother who is the narrative voice while their two spirits follow the police investigation and keep company at their bedsides with the husband/father and son/brother who are left bereft by the tragedy.<br /><br />By using this original device, the author makes us privy to all strands of the mystery and ratchets up the tension by contrasting the urgency of the investigation with the deteriorating health of the mother and daughter.<br /><br />A fantastic read.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|Different from the movie. Should be read by everyone. Review should be short and sweet.I need five more words. Goodbye
B0064MGU98|5.0|the good wife makes the shows from david e kelley look like remedial law. alicia florrick is truly an iconic figure of my generation.
B007U1FEJE|2.0|I thought the Beach Boys might have reinvented themselves (like the BeeGees did 2-3 times), but nope.  They tried to update their stuff a bit, but missed the mark.  We listened to it only once.  But if you are a diehard Beach Boys fan, you might like it.
B00AKCJB44|3.0|I loved the music when I saw the movie, and so naturally I bought the soundtrack afterwards. I didn't check the track list before buying because I assumed it would include all of the songs in the movie (or at least all of the important ones). However, \\"Freedom\\" by Richie Havens, which I think was one of the more important music selections used in the movie, is not on the soundtrack.<br /><br />According to another review it is also missing the final credits track which was written specifically for the movie, and I seem to remember there being another rap track in the movie that isn't on here, but I could be mistaken about that. Either way, the soundtrack is missing at least 2 tracks that are essential to the movie, and instead they included some brief and unimportant bits of dialogue.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is the only one of the trilogy I've read.  Have to admit that I kept reading it -- I got sucked in to the dynamic between the two main characters.  There's an odd mix of Victorian and 2012 -- the characters are always texting each other and jetting around, but often call each other Mr. Grey and Miss Steele and use a stuffy old-fashioned style.  You could find that appealing or off-putting.  Mainly, the eroticism didn't work for me -- I kept wanting the female character to be more assertive and draw more 'lines in the sand.'  Also, the female character keeps hoping the guy will change, which isn't the message I would want reinforced with young women.  I have friends who are hooked on the trilogy, so you might like it.
B005SDMDRW|1.0|...but these were not great stories.<br /><br />Some people are novel writers, some people are short story writers. (Short stories are actually quite a difficult form to master) Based on this collection, plus the matching Angle Of Investigation, Michael Connelly is NOT a short story writer. However this will NOT  effect my enjoyment of Bosch & Co at their correct, novel length.
0590259385|5.0|Granddaughter, mom and granddaughter all love it.  It is fun to read -- easy to add your inflection to it.  The question &#34;Is your mama a Llama&#34; is asked of multiple animals who describe some feature of their mothers that distinguishes them from llamas.  Helps little ones identify animals.  The repetition and rhythm make reading it fun.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like the game and LOVE the audio portion.  However, this particular application (for the size of tablets) is difficult to discern the differences between the tiles.  There is WAY TOO MUCH artwork for such small tiles.  Unless you have some really good glasses, this wears you out pretty good.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|Heard an interview of Gardot on NPR, and a sample of her music.  I immediately bought the CD for my husband's birthday.  We play it all the time, and I'm about to buy two more to give as gifts.  Gardot's voice is so interesting -- a bit of Norah Jones with some Joni Mitchell thrown in.  Her delivery is gentle and understated...makes you want to sink into the music... that is until you get to one of her livelier songs and you can't help but tap your toe and snap your fingers.  Read her bio on wikipedia - quite the story.  If you get this CD, and don't like the first song all that much, be sure to keep listening.  The second song hooked us.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|First of all, please arrow me to say the followings:  I concider myself as just an ordinally, middle-of-the-road or middle-of-nowhere, average guy whome you would find in your home town or anywhere in the world, have a decent, sober persepective or sense toward the life of my own or a person's life in general, and nomarlly I am not a type of a person who expresses his emortions openly in front of others or share his thoughts with anybody, including all my family members, relatives, and friends, but I have to confess that I cried over this DVD, not a once, but many times:  while I was watching it and even afterwards, say even as late as today, right at the moment of writing this review on my computer:  I'm shedding some tears, remembering the scenes I watched in the movie.  This simple, undenyable fact proves just how incretably moving film this is.  The producers, staffs, and every-single-actors / actress appeared in the movie have done their best work, making this film true-to-life: thus, one of the most accurately portrated / customized story form the historical real event.  I strongly recomemd this mortion picture to anyone who has love toward the dogs in general. It's a good stroy to show what a unconditional love means and to prove whether a ture royality exist or notm, even between two different kinds of speices.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|Horner is one of those composers whose work often seems to polarize listeners. Before writing this review I read many of the other reviews here and although I agree with some of the criticisms (lifting too much of his previous work, for example), the fact remains that I just liked the score and found it beautiful and compelling, and a perfect accompaniment to the movie. I thought the action music part of the score particularly good, with much dramatic use of interval and even a bit of chromaticism.<br /><br />Horner is also famous for scoring Titanic and yes, the themes here are sometimes a bit maudlin and cheesy as some have claimed in the case of Titanic, but then one must remember it's a movie score and not a Bartok or Shostokovich string quartet with music that only a Ph.D. in musicology could love. Horner's  music is all about emotion, expression, simple but compelling melodies with often complex accompaniments, occasional powerful use of percussion, judicious use of human voices, and I have no problem with any of that. In fact I like it. I like it a lot. If I want classical values and sophistication I can always pull out my old collection of vinyl Toscanini recordings from the 40s and 50s. But sometimes I just want something uncomplicated, charming, but beautiful, and Horner can often do that better than anyone else. That's enough for me.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|Story was slow and I doze off.  No big surprises and very predictable.  Acting was good but the story was not.
0385344333|3.0|Jack Reacher has surfaced in Nebraska. The protagonist in Lee Child's popular Reacher thriller series is on the move again, this time en route to Virginia to see a woman he's never met though the sound of her voice, heard once on the phone, is calling to him. And why not, he replies when someone asks. He's a retired, decorated MP with nothing but time on his hands and the open road at his feet.<br /><br />Part Caped Crusader, part Terminator, part Excel spreadsheet, there's almost nothing this guy can't do. But he's at a bit of a disadvantage hitchhiking in Nebraska. It's cold out, it's the middle of the night and his bloodied, broken nose adds yet more menace to his hulking 6-foot, 5-inch frame. The spreadsheet in him tallies a total of 40 cars that have passed him in one dark, frigid hour.<br /><br />The 17th novel in the Reacher series, \\"A Wanted Man,\\" is less a thriller and more a precision procedural. Where once Reacher led with his fists, he now leads with his calculations -- probabilities, number of bad guys left standing, number of words you can say without using the first letter of the alphabet. Most of the action is in his head.<br /><br />When a car finally slows down for Reacher, the occupants are not who they say they are. And State Police running massive roadblocks let the car through because it's Reacher they see, with his battered face. He's clearly not among the men they're looking for so they let the car, with its murderer, drive right on through.<br /><br />Reacher gets involved the minute he realizes that (A) the two men in the car are lying to him and (B) the scared-looking woman in the back seat has a 10-year-old daughter. She's probably a hostage and Reacher is compelled to intervene.<br /><br />At the time, Reacher is unaware that, not far away, a man has been brutally stabbed in an abandoned concrete bunker in the middle of nowhere. The stabbing and the hostage taking are linked. By the time Reacher begins to piece things together, he's fully committed to his intervention. The bad guys also capture an FBI agent, a good guy who could have killed Reacher but spared him at some risk to his own safety. There are many reasons why Reacher sets out to determine who these bad guys are and rescue the FBI agent.<br /><br />A farmer witnesses some of the action and disappears. So does a female FBI agent investigating the case. And then it's Reacher's turn to get nabbed. All are brought to a federal jail of sorts where they are treated to fresh clothes, decent food and nice, soft beds. It's a kind of witness silencing program. The person killed in the bunker is an important American trade attach&eacute; and no one with knowledge of his murder is safe. They are either hunted down by the bad guys or captured by the Americans.<br /><br />Child always gives us strong female characters. This time it's a couple of FBI agents who work with Reacher. One of them is an undercover agent and a mom. The other is a beautiful Scandinavian agent who appears to be the government's lead investigator, at least temporarily. The three of them ultimately close in on the mysterious killers and, between them, exact revenge.<br /><br />Child spends a lot of time inside Reacher's head doing calculations when he should be developing characters. Reacher, for one, used to have more to him. One of his defining charms is his brusque methodical approach to solving crimes and killing bad guys, but this time he's so calculated as to appear almost robotic. The author is a smart and informed plotter but the avenging killer that Jack Reacher has become needs something more in his life than his fold-up toothbrush, his debit card and his hitching thumb. Let's hope he gets to Virginia where his association with the mystery woman supplies him with an infusion of multi-dimensionality. Long live Reacher!y committed to his intervention.

B007OV6AT8|5.0|PD James is an excellent writer. But as a mystery writer she breaks rank with the standard form in that it is almost impossible to figure out in advance &#34;who done it&#34;. This is because vital information is often reserved for about the first 70% or so, of the book. Also, the characters are not true to how they are described in the book. For example she will describe a character as weak and infirm and then have that same character throttling a younger and much stronger victim. Her writing is what saves the book. Just relax and enjoy the book. Don't try to figure out who the criminal is. PD will reveal this only when she is good and ready.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|The first half of this book was a five-star effort for me. I really couldn't put it down and I read it late into the night because, unlike many other thrillers, it wasn't obvious which way it was going to go. It was so interesting the way the financial crisis was reflected in Nick and Amy's personal downfall. When the mystery about what really happened to Amy is solved in the second part of the book it lost a little bit of momentum but it was still a very good read. The way the author made me completely change my perspective and sympathies towards the main characters was brilliantly done. As it continued though I started to see a few holes. It's hard to talk about this book without giving away plot details so if you haven't read it before please stop reading now.<br /><br />I couldn't buy the fact that a girl like Amy would ever come up with a plan that involved her own suicide, no matter how desperately she wanted revenge on Nick. All she really had to do was leave Nick and reclaim the bar to destroy his life. Someone that narcissistic and ego-driven would not even contemplate killing herself in my opinion, because in her eyes it would be the ultimate defeat. I had real trouble buying this aspect of the story and it got worse.<br /><br />Amy turned into a caricature rather than a real person and the book changed from a gritty, realistic thriller to something much less interesting. Why did Amy have to be such an over-the-top sociopath who somehow managed to hide this from her husband and everyone else except her victims for so long? Why did Desi have to be such a complete weirdo who  decorated his lake house for her despite the fact that he hadn't seen her in twenty years? It would have been very easy to portray both these characters more realistically, and in taking this direction much of the tension was lost for me.<br /><br />I appreciate the way the author portrayed the media frenzy that takes place around the disappearances/murder of attractive, rich, white women, but it all started to feel very rushed as it reached its conclusion, and the ending was truly disappointing. It's a shame because I thought I was going to love this book so much, but it was worth reading for the enjoyment I got out of the fist two thirds at least.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|Good to see roles for these two great actors, but the script let them down, in my opinion. A pity.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|fast paced, unexpected twists in the story and believable characters. its woderful to have women play a major part in this story
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not a sci-fi reader but I LOVED LOVED LOVED this series! I simply could not put the book down. Thankfully I read on my Kindle so I could purchase books 6 & 7 in the middle of the night after I finished book 5! I couldn't wait!! I love the concept, and the author thought of everything for living underground. Amazing! I can't wait to read more about the character's and their lives in the silo. KUDOS to a new author for a riveting series. :) Congratulations, Mr. Howey.<br /><br />I chose this series for my book club and so far the reviews have been amazing! I haven't heard one negative comment about the series. LOVE IT!!

0399157565|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is a great read. Her look into the world of forensic science is interesting and informative and always well written.
0765325950|5.0|Well its over. The book I started reading between practices in my first year of college football left me ignoring football all day despite the nfc and afc championship games being great. I could not stop reading the final 500 pages, after twenty years I had to know \\"It wasn't a beginning it wasn't the ending but it was the ending\\" and while some parts left you wanting more of a prologue, it left a very satisfying ending in the lap of the reader.....despite not having actually read a \\"book\\" not on e-reader in a few years.<br /><br />I think through the series we all had one or two charcaters we found a piece of ourselves in. most of the charcaters who have had POV chapters in the books that where not killed got mentioned in the book and had their own moments to shine. But it took us back to the core seven we all loved from the first book. Worth while read and I hope that they do eventually turn this into the movie that has been talked about forever....
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I think this is one of the best of John Grisham's recent novels. Well told story, riveting, keeps you guessing to the very end. Highly recommend.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Colin Firth give a bravura performance. That poor man suffered so but the love of the Queen Mum was steadfast. Truly gripping and heartfelt?
B00APUQPX6|4.0|All three of our kids really enjoy the Ice Age series, so they were excited to rent it and it did not disappoint. There were many laughs and the kids (ages 9,12,13) were captivated the whole movie.
B000SEI230|4.0|This was a tenderhearted book. I have not read much of this author's work but I did really enjoy this. It's easy to know where the story is headed, which in this case made me want to keep reading because of the sweetness of the writing. There are lessons to be learned from this, such as that things are not always what they seem, imagine yourself in the other person's shoes, don't jump to judge people. The book was well worth reading.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Suspenseful read. Hated to finish it because the relationship would be over and I wouldn't see them again. Am now reading &#34;girl who played with fire&#34;. Glad same characters are continuing their adventures. Recomende highly.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I love this CD, it was even better than I expected. Her music is so eccentric and different. As for the order, it came in right on time with no issues (such as breaking in the mail, which has happened to me before), so I'm really grateful and happy with this order!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Fun would enjoy more if there were no commercials!<br /><br />Will play again especially when I need to have a brain challenge day.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|This was a good read. This lad can write a good book and does not fail here. The plot involves moving nukes around, shell corporations and counter espionage while our hero tries to thwart the baddies making very large holes in some cities.<br />Recommended for fans of spy thrillers wrt covert ops between between nations.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Instantly got me interested!! Such a funny and heartwarming story!! I have already suggested it to a few of my friends to read!!
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I really looked forward to reading what I understood to be a quirky romantic story of a high school misfit.  I found the main character detached and aloof.  The author managed to throw in date rape, domestic violence, drug use (to include a character being tricked into using), hetero and homosexual sex, oral sex, abortion, and incest.  It was quirky alright--a complete waste of time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun fun fun love the horse everything looks so real great game for kid. hours of fun. I will bbe telling my friends about it.
B0045XGRQE|3.0|Not a bad way to spend a few hours.  I liked the first Iron Man more, but it's still pretty good.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|This movie spins  stories of friendship, love and liquor during the time of prohibition.  You root for the makers and runners of the spirits while hoping that the law will be defeated.  Violent-Yes. Bloody-Yes.  If you're looking for a feel good movie, keep searching.  If you're looking for a movie full of suspense and drama, then you've found the one.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like this game,  but you are limited on the energy you acquire and it takes a long time for you it to build back up. I think it is a lot of fun though.

B009ZQTD7Q|4.0|The story of Jane Eyre is classic, the tale of a young girl harassed by relatives, sent away to a harsh boarding school but manages to retain her sense of spirit, identity and independence as she grows up, is both harrowing but uplifting. Jane is not bitter about her circumstances. She is wise enough, even from a young age, to understand how things work and not embittered as a result. She grows up strong and fine, emotionally muted but not without her hopes and dreams. In Mr. Rochester, tempestuous, frustrated and trapped, does she find all that she's been seeking, and in Jane, does Mr. Rochester may truly find solace, but in the end, to heart breaking results.<br /><br />Jane Eyre is one of my all time favorite novels and the various adaptations have always left me wanting. The most recent, and modern, version, [[ASIN:B0053Q9DHW Jane Eyre]], from 2011 was an interesting albeit stilted addition to the Jane Eyre Movie Oeuvre but then I came across this older version, which delighted me. This version has the feel and restrained emotion that is present in the book. Of yearning and that touch and go between Jane and Edward that was so palpable and tangible though always slightly removed, as though Bronte wanted us to be close, on bated breath, but not too close. The 2011 version has that same sustained angst and yearning, its telling is still very choppy but the interplay between Wasikowska and Fassbender is riveting. The trick, becomes, how to play two desperate beings as one and every adaptation has its own interpretation and that's what's fascinating.<br /><br />I've seen other versions: [[ASIN:B000784WMW Jane Eyre]] (1983, 11-episodes!), which was very low budget, almost theater-like but the mood/tone of the book is present, the 1997 [[ASIN:0767020294 Jane Eyre]] version with Ciaran Hinds and disliked by most, the [[ASIN:B000LPQ6DE Masterpiece Theatre: Jane Eyre]] (2006) version that had more misses than hits and deviated too much from the book, while the 2011 version was more flash than content, too short and not as satisfying, though none are by any means insufficient. I enjoyed all the versions and all had their flaws and wonderful moments. For some reason, I've always passed on this version. Mainly because I didn't envision William Hurt as the ideal Mr. Rochester, nor Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane.<br /><br />However, Hurt was controlled and perfectly on pitch, both explosive when needed and quietly aching when appropriate, though granted, not the Rochester usually so fiercely depicted. Gainsbourg was quite good, elegant and graceful, ethereal and haunting, yet ever so present but most importantly, exactly precise in her rendering of Jane, maintaining that poise and subdued emotions on the brink of erupting. Some while find this version too restrained and subdued, that the chemistry between Hurt and Gainsbourg is lacking. I didn't mind that interpretation and I loved the interplay between Hurt and Gainsbourg, who used their bodies and facial expressions to convey their feelings for one another. In the book, there is this sense that, from Bronte, the relationship and intimacy of Rochester and Jane is entirely their own, that the audience doesn't ever truly participate but watch from afar, as pure observers. In this version, the director does exactly that and it's so much more powerful. It's not too much acting or costuming or production though the editing was a bit pitchy at parts. Ultimately, this is a movie that needs to be watched a few times to really appreciate the actors portrayals of Jane and Mr. Rochestor, not just the primary ones but the secondary cast that brought more credibility to the overall feel and presentation of the story.

He has managed to flesh out Nucky Thompson so well I root for his character not because he's good, but because he's HUMAN. And isn't that Paz de la Huerta a gas !? Where did this gal come from ?<br />Thanks HBO,you rock. ;-)

B00AYDC3CG|4.0|Lots of fun, clever and amusing--just not for little kids. We kind of missed the color, as it is basically black and white. Still worth it. Memorable!
B0000VCZKM|3.0|I got this for $5 at another store.  The quality is pretty bad, it's very fuzzy, I understand it's an older movie but I wouldn't spend more than $5 for it.  I will add that i watched this in the theatres as a child and it just didn't hold up over time.<br /><br />We recently rented the Disney version and I thought it was wonderful, but unfortunately they cut a substantial number of songs.  Victor Garber was great, as well as Audra McDonald.  Anne Reinking as Grace, in this version, really doesn't have a great voice and I winced through \\"I think I'm gonna like it here\\". It really was awful.  Albert Finney seems to just scream the entire movie, I don't know why any child would want to to be adopted by him.  This version is just way too long, they really needed to edit a good 20 minutes or even more from this mess.  My kids and I started losing interest about 90 minutes in.  Also, they neglect to use \\"NYC\\", one of ,h favorite songs in the show and substitute it with a subpar song called \\"Movies, Movies\\" or whatever and omit \\"Herbert hoover\\" as well.  Then they add some other numbers like \\"We got Annie\\"' etc and what is the point of Punjab?  Ugh.  Just terrible.<br /><br />I only wish the Disney version didn't cut any songs because hands down, it's a better version.  Combine that with the 30th Anniversary soundtrack and I think you'd be much happier than owning this DVD.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I find myself telling people about this series all the time. The writing, the humor, the acting, the drama, the action, female leads that are uncanny and unshrinking--even the effects are pretty good all things considered. Unfortunately, explaining that it's a scifi show with kind of a space cowboy theme doesn't seem to resonate with too many people. And yet, this series, more than most of popular television, has the potential to appeal to such a wide audience.<br /><br />I sat down for a marathon as soon as I got this box set. Pretty soon, both my brother and my mom were watching it right along with me. Let me just clarify as well that we all have very different tastes in movies and television. My brother likes FIFA and Entourage. My mom likes America's Next Top Model and pretty much whatever is on BBC. I like Madmen and Merlin. My other friends that like it watch CSI and Adventure Time. Firefly isn't comparable to any one of these series in particular, but it balances different elements of different genres in the way that most things that are written well seem to do. if you find yourself doubting that a science fiction show could appeal to you just watch the first two episodes. I bet you'll end up watching the whole first season, and then start shaking your fist when you come up short against the fact that there is no second season. There really is no second season and the reasons for why this series got cancelled continue to baffle people to this day.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I was really hard on Bruno Mars when he released his debut album `Doo-Wops & Hooligans'.  Ok, I wasn't harsh as much as realistic.  It was catchy yet lazy and really showed a lack of depth in a rising star I wanted to see a more complete thought from.  It was redundant and uninspired and too nonchalant for its own good.  I still gave it a C, and I still love a few of the tracks on the album (who can deny `Just the Way You Are', and obviously `Marry Me' is still catchy and lovely as all get out) but there is no hiding my disappointment with the effort overall.<br /><br />`Unorthodox Jukebox' is a different animal.<br /><br />This is NOT a perfect album, and yet I really think that this better identifies who Bruno Mars is and presents a more complete approach to his breed of nostalgic pseudo-pop.  Some claim that Mars genre hops all over this album and yet I don't see that.  Mars is very focused on the type of music he is producing here, and it shows in a very consistent and overall very impactful album.  From the first single sampling The Police, Bruno Mars salivates all over 80's rock-pop in a way that feels fresh, funky and completely reflective.  Mars still suffers from some lazy lyric development, but his silky smooth vocals and his direct approach make this a very enjoyable album from start to finish.<br /><br />Outside of the ill-advised `Show Me' (why to all `island' songs carry the same repetitive and uninspired musicality?), this album showcases nostalgic pop done with a modern twist very well.  `Locked Out Of Heaven' is so juicy and delicious to the ears, and `Treasure' explores the highlights of Motown with pitch perfect charisma.  `Natalie' pulls darker strings until that chorus line bursts in and just explodes all over the place.  `Moonshine' feels very `Phil Collins' to me, which is something I really like.  `Money Make Her Smile' and `Young Girls' seem a little uninspired lyrically, but the musical prowess of the tracks make them pop in all the right places.  `Young Girls' sooths on the eardrums and `Money Make Her Smile' uses vocal distortion in the right way.  `Gorilla' is exactly how you do an edgy love song (or `make love' song), complete with rock ballad influence igniting the chorus, and the closing track, `If I Knew' is fluid and just plain beautiful to listen to (his voice is perfectly suited for ballads).  The throwback vibe here (I mean, Frankie Valli would have drooled all over this song) is such a classic way to end this album.  It is far better than `When I Was Your Man', which feels somewhat generic in tone despite having some beautiful vocals.<br /><br />So, this is a major step up from his debut.  I don't like `Show Me' at all, but that is really the only sour note (even `When I Was Your Man' is a good song despite being unoriginal).  The more I think about it, the more I'm inclined to give Bruno Mars top honors for this collection of inspired and impressive tracks.laces.  `Young Girls' sooths on the eardrums and `Money Make Her Smile' uses vocal distortion in the right way.  `Gorilla' is exactly how you do an edgy love song (or `make love' song), complete with rock ballad influence igniting the chorus, and the closing track, `If I Knew' is fluid and just plain beautiful to listen to (his voice is perfectly suited for ballads).

B006LR0XLM|1.0|Couldn't understand where the dropbox went too on my computer to use at first. It didn't sync correctly. I don't even use it at all now. And ironically, as soon as I downloaded and tried to use with my mobile -- I got over 50 calls in one day from spam calls or 'robo-calls'. I never give out my cell and not sure if my # was picked up from some database Dropbox uses, but I had to block 5 phone #'s from calling my cell over and over. I don't know if the program is truly related to this phone issue I was having, but it was a bit ironic. So I will not be using this service. Unfortunately, I don't have a true experience using the product because of my frustrations. But it might be a good service for others.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|Growing up, there were few films I watched as much as `Oliver and Company'.  It was my favorite movie and I think I went through about three VHS tapes.  Between this and `Beauty and the Beast', I was constantly singing throughout the house (`Why Should I Worry' brings an instant smile to my face).  As a father, I'm always wondering why they can't make cartoons for kids like they used to.  That isn't to say that the animated films presented to children today aren't progressive and engaging in their own right, but the films that came out in the late 80's, early 90's were just so superior (although, I'm bias thanks to nostalgia).<br /><br />`Oliver and Company' is an animated take on Charles Dickens' `Oliver Twist', this time substituting the characters for animals.  Oliver is a young stray cat who is all alone until he meets Dodger, a street dog who works with a group of thieving dogs for their master Fagan, a simpleton yet kind hearted man.  Oliver gets accepted as `one of the dogs' but no sooner is he `at home' a job goes awry and Oliver is separated from his newfound family.  He meets Jenny, a young girl who falls in love with the kitten and takes him home as her pet.  Dodger and his gang, thinking that Oliver has been kidnapped, set off to rescue their friend.<br /><br />A landmark in animation, `Oliver and Company' was the first animated film to incorporate computer images with the hand-drawn animation used in animated films prior.  The animation is sharp, the characters are beautifully detailed and the overall effect is wholly memorable.<br /><br />With great music, a memorable plot and heartwarming character development, `Oliver and Company' soars and remains one of my favorite animated films ever made.  My children adore it, and it is a great family film.  It teaches the morals of right and wrong in a fun and spunky way, and while the depiction of `evil' can be rather one-dimensional (most animated films of the 80's depicted evil with cigars and deep voices) it doesn't take away from the impact of the film at all.  Joey Lawrence's voice work is outstanding (perfect casting) and the grand finale will certainly leave a lump in your throat.<br /><br />They sure don't make them like they used to!t doesn't take away from the impact of the film at all.

0307960471|3.0|This is my third Harry Hole novel this month.  I really wish that I had started at the beginning, but once I got sucked in I had to keep moving forward, and the great thing about Nesbo's writing is that he creates a unified reading experience that is, for the most part, not contingent on what came before.  Each book acts as their own story and the characters built within it are fully fleshed out and don't require the reader to have read the books that came before.  Yes, it will help in some instances, but it isn't a requirement.  Nesbo takes the time to color in each character with enough detail (building detail over the course of the novels as well) so that we aren't missing anything.<br /><br />If you look back at my reviews of `The Snowman' and `The Leopard' you'll see that I really like this series.  I found `The Snowman' tightly woven, intense (if not a tad silly) and I found `The Leopard' to be near-perfection.  `Phantom' was a bit of an odd experience for me.  It started off so dull and confused and it had such a different style to it that I was severely put off, and then the second half kicked in and the story picked up and I saw a return to form for Nesbo and what I have come to expect of his craft and I was blown away by the conclusion.<br /><br />So I'm torn.<br /><br />I don't like saying too much about these books since Nesbo's clever writing style will have you literally second guessing everything until the final reveal, but I'll say this.  `Phantom' is not about a serial killer.  Instead, Nesbo tackles Oslo's underworld of doping.  I've not read any of the Hole novels that came before `The Snowman', so I'm not sure if this is familiar territory for Nesbo or if this is a new idea, but I'm not sure it works entirely like Nesbo wanted it to.  I'm not saying that murder is more entertaining, and yet maybe I am.  The drug underworld isn't as captivating or as thrilling as Nesbo wants it to be, and the barrage of characters that come at us in the beginning of the novel make it slightly difficult to follow or get into.  Once you sort them all out (I actually had to look back over the first few chapters to sort out the names and place them with the actions) it becomes an easier read.  The narrative follows Hole coming back home to Oslo (he's been living in Hong Kong) when he hears that Oleg, the son of his lost love Rakel, has been arrested for murdering a junkie named Gusto.  Hole, no longer on the police force, takes matters into his own hands to prove Oleg's innocence.  This takes him deeper into the world of violin, a new drug that has overtaken Oslo and the surrounding areas and it's kingpin, an old man who haunts Oslo like a phantom.<br /><br />One thing I didn't really like was the interwoven flashback to the murder told in Gusto's first person.  It just felt really gimmicky and didn't add a whole lot to the story.  The same revelations could have been told in Nesbo's more natural style and made the same, if not more of an impact.  I just found the first person sections to be really whinny and hard to get into, especially in the beginning (the first half of the novel was really where I had the hardest time).  Hole's continued development as a person is really impressive though, and what Nesbo has done with him in just the three novels that I read was outstanding.  He really creates a living breathing entity, and just when you think you've learned all you can, he gives us more.<br /><br />And then you have the ending.  I won't give away spoilers (I sadly read one before reading the novel and so I was awaiting something I wished I wasn't) but I will say that all is never as it seems with Nesbo, so people should not read into it.  Nesbo has a wonderful way of leading us down the wrong path only to flip it on us, and the ambiguous nature of the finale can be interpreted in a few ways.<br /><br />As a whole, this novel did redeem itself, but it can't fully escape some poor decisions on Nesbo's part.  I'd give it a C+,mostly due to the fact that the final few chapters are beyond gripping.  Those last 100 pages just fly past as you desperately race for answers.mostly due to the fact that the final few chapters are beyond gripping.

B009KHDT0C|4.0|It was hardly anything like the original series which I knew before watching it. It was quite funny, and still suspenceful. Obviously a Burton film which can be good or bad depending on your feelings toward Burton films. I gave it four stars, would have made it five if it had been a little more like the series which I loved as a child. Still worth watching whether you liked the series or have never seen it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was so excited to start reading this book...I could barely put it down.<br />The plot had so many twists and surprises.  Every time I thought I had it figured<br />out something new happened.  Loved the book and can't wait to read the last<br />book.
B00ANT6OK8|1.0|For me this movie was all about the female CIA agent ~2 hrs worth, 30 mins of confusion inside the OBL compound.

0756405890|5.0|It's rare for me to find a book written in first-person that I absolutely love, but this is one of the very few.<br /><br />It is rare for me to absolutely love a book that was this hyped-up to me prior to reading it. Luckily, this one lived up to the hype.<br /><br />Despite its length (700+pages) the sentences are crafted in such a way that you never feel as though the book is getting longer the further you read. I loved the unique voice and telling-style of this book. I liked the \\"Princess Bride\\" and \\"Neverending Story\\"-ness of it dipping out of past-tense first person and back into third-person reminding me every so often that this story is being told by the main character to the fantasy-version of a journalist or biographer.<br /><br />The book is well-written, interesting, and filled with likeable characters and just enough action to keep you from getting restless while you read. It is surprisingly clean, even lacking most of the innuendo and crudeness that tends to pervade the modern fantasy novel.<br /><br />The one \\"con\\" to the story is that it does sort of just ... end. It is the first book in a trilogy, and I would venture to say that it does not stand on its own very well, so if you don't like cliff-hanger endings or novels that can't stand alone outside of their trilogy, then you probably won't enjoy this book.<br /><br />I do not have that problem, which is why I am able to give it 5 stars.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I am not a fan of zombie books! However, this is the best zombie book that I have ever read (let me not qualify it, its one of the best books that I have read). I really liked how the author made the subject of zombie serious (very serious). This book is more about the human experience when society is faced with a global crisis that is threatening the existence of the race. The story is very original and engaging.<br /><br />This book will definitely make you think about preparedness. What would you do if a crisis hit this country and you had to leave your home?
0307463745|2.0|If you are a hipster, you'll probably love this book. If you are a big fan of commercials & you switch channels constantly with a short attention span, you'll probably love this book. For me it was easily forgettable. It does have a few good points, but I find the writing style arrogant & presumptuous. Yes, the writers have enjoyed some success, but this book seems more about rubbing the noses of the rest of us in it, than in sharing anything of substance. I read it once & gave it away.

B005FISBTO|3.0|While the first five seasons were nail-biting and thought-provoking at every turn, season six is an unqualified letdown in many ways.<br /><br />The twist that occurs shortly after the half-way point is so obvious and predictable that even a viewer unacquainted with crime dramas could see it coming miles away. The chief antagonist is hardly interesting (Dexter without rules, with several lengthy psycho-babble terms applied to his dossier), and the gore and viscera that are displayed make it look like the creators wanted to distract viewers from the poor writing and utter lack of introspection. This tactic was ultimately doomed to failure, as Dexter wastes an entire episode extending a storyline that played itself out in the early days of season five. We would have been better entertained (and the world of the show would have been better served) if the bulk of the episode was focused on Debra and her new responsibilities and revelations that she was forced to come to terms with during season five's climax.<br /><br />The side characters have become more of a sideshow. Quinn becomes a bumbling alcoholic, Angel Batista returns to clobbering anyone who looks at him the wrong way, and LaGuerta and Matthews are largely absent for the most part. With the dullest villain imaginable, this leaves little for fans of any character (although Masuka always delivers on the black/sick/filthy comedy front). The early scenes with Dexter's school reunion and his disposal of a serial killer who has entered Geriatric Land are entertaining, and leads to perhaps the most profound epiphany that Dexter learns regarding Harrison, his late-night hobby and himself.<br /><br />Overall, however, this season went off the rails, and was a disappointing cul-de-sac after five seasons of psychological introspection.

B004SBS8LA|4.0|I got the game to try it out, it was another good addition to the angry birds series. I also like how it did not have any type of ads while playing
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|There was a lot of loose ends to tie up in this final installment and they did a pretty good job. Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway surprised me with their chemistry. Worth the long movie length.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This is my second favourite game on my phone.  It's a great time-waster, I've spent hours trying to improving my score.<br /><br />Frenzy mode with the frozen bananas is the best!
B003XQM2YU|3.0|I'm a big Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett fan but this film fell a little short for me. I found the plot to be predictable and when I can figure out what is going to happen next in a movie - well - I lose interest. It didn't keep me as engaged as I expected it would.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have enjoyed this app for my smartphone and can now enjoy it on my kindle. Looking for my games of this quality from the developer.
B0073L91MW|3.0|I've watched enough WWII movies to last a lifetime so I guess I'm a bit jaded. Band of brothers this is not, but it is still a good movie based on a true story of how the British Special Forces came into being.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|This is and extraordinary movie and one of the best of 2012. The only ones that can compare are the Dark Knight Rises and the Hobbit
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This was a great gift for my wife. She loves this show, and it's cheaper to order the seasons separately here on Amazon than to order the 3 season set from PBS.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|My favorite show on television. The third season is even better and I can't wait for the second half of the season comes back February 10th
B0080K3G4O|5.0|I was a bit tentative about getting this book, never mind reading it.  But once I started through the first few<br />pages I was very much getting into his viewpoint and well thought out and documented reasoning.<br />Definitely recommend this book!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Exciting: good character development; timely.  Draws you right into the story. It is real enough that you wonder of much of  this tech/cybor warfare cna really be accomplished.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|its functional just like it should. function equals good app that works as well as a site of any other thing.
B00884GR0W|4.0|Ok theres a lot of things to tell about this game. This game is similar to minecraft PE. But this one has much more features than minecraft. You can build houses, fight enemies, do objectives, and you can even build a car or a boat just to explore! This game is not like PE its more like the minecraft pc version. So this two dollars worth for. PS: if you are afraid of spiders becareful. The spiders in this game look very REAL!!!)
B0050R0YB8|5.0|I loved building this piece. I built it with my six year old and we had a blast!Thanks LEGO for having something like this out there.
B007NG93CK|4.0|Interesting side info on Motorsport origins. I'm always a bit sad when I finish the book and don't have another to start. Eagerly await the next installment
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I've had a lot of fun building this project with my son. We are almost done but we love it already. The detail and the playability are great. Highly recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay could not have been a better ending to this amazing trilogy! Highly recommend them all! I even doubted them at first, but I am so glad I caved in!
B008OB1QFK|4.0|This one is only a little victory indeed. Owning all of his albums (and loving them) I have to admit that this one falls back slightly so that it´s not a  big victory but just a little one since the album is good yet fails to impress in a way previous albums have done, particularly his second album Pretty Good Guy. Even though the gloomy stuff like Down by the river, North Dakota, and If I Were You may not be easy on you that mood has impressed me most - maybe because hardly anybody else ever came along with stuff like that. In any case I will be watching all future releases by Chris.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Helps with my spelling because I'm a auful speller<br />It is a good dictionary you should get it its awsome
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was introduced to this by my son.  He loaded it on my phone first and then I decided to get it on my kindle. The feature I love the most is the reading out loud.  I have increased my Bible reading time because I follow along as &#34;he&#34; reads.  It has several Bible reading plans and I am now doing the one on the Prophets in 60 days.  I just really Love this.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Looked like a video game. Lots of explosions and exploding machinery. No real story. Not much of a plot. Fits right into that 18-25 year old market.
030758836X|1.0|If I could I would give this book a minus 5 Stars.<br /><br />I read this book with no preconceptions.  I'd not read Flynn before and I'd heard nothing about this book in particular.  It was available from the library and I wanted to test out Kindle library loans (which work great by the way) so I borrowed Gone Girl.<br /><br />From the very beginning I was bothered by the self-conscious posturing of both Nick and Amy.  Neither seemed quite real.  I couldn't willingly suspend my disbelief and accept them into my head.<br /><br />But I persevered, thinking maybe it would get better.  After all technically, Flynn is a decent writer.  It's hard for me to put a book down once I start it.  A part of me always wants to know \\"So what happened next?\\" even in poorly written books.  So, I read it through to the end.<br /><br />The 'Big' revelations and 'plot twists' along the way were not big at all.  They were telegraphed from the very beginning.  The only character that was half-way believable was Go, Nick's twin sister.  But worse than not being believeable, most of the other characters were written ugly to the core.  Well, Andie and the cops were not exactly ugly to the core, just vapid.<br /><br />For a novel to be successful, there have to be characters you care about, that you want to root for.  I didn't find even one in Gone Girl.<br /><br />My advice.  If you're like me and tend to read to the end, even when the book isn't very good, don't begin reading Gone Girl.  You'll be better off not looking into the cesspool these characters represent.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|My daughter wanted me to watch a movie with her and picked this one. I wasn't overly excited at first but went along. Wound up being a pretty funny movie and some really funny lines. Even my son (15) and wife stayed and watched the whole thing which is unusual for them with a \\"cutsy\\" movie.<br />There is some language but not overblown and no string of \\"F\\" words like so many comedies. Found it total fine for my 13 and 15 year old.<br />Would recommend if you want a good movie knowing that it is going to be silly and not to be taken seriously.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|George R. R. Martin has created a beautifully written, intelligent, and and exciting read!  Looking forward to reading the other books in this collection.
B000005AYL|1.0|I got my fiancé a record player for Christmas. I actually got this album for me. It was on sale at an unbelievable deal so I couldn't pass it up but the album was scratched. Every song on both sides skips. I was so disappointed.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Super duper book. The series gets better and and better. I LOVE HOW THERE'S SO MUCH ACTION! OMG! In love with this series.
1609611543|5.0|This is an interesting book to say the least. Its controversial because it goes against the current MyPlate/Food Pyramid and the common wisdom that grains are good for us. I had stopped eating wheat prior to reading this book and found that I have a slight wheat intolerance which I now understand is somewhat more common than previously believed. This book sealed the deal in terms of other books I have read along the same theme. I stopped eating grains in order to lose weight (following the Primal Blueprint) and it worked fairly effortlessly, with the exception of the first few weeks which I could only describe as difficult (headaches and fatigue brought on by what I can only now call withdrawal symptoms or diet adaptation). This book illustrates how wheat has changed through time as well as how our diet changed with the introduction of the food pyramid. It also has chock full of cases in which seemingly unrelated symptoms were a manifestation of wheat intolerance or celiacs disease. Great book and an easy read to boot!
0375842209|2.0|Trying to finish this book can only be compared to a dentist appointment. You feel obligated to show up, but it's not fun for a second. The book wanders through over 500 pages without ever really making up its mind about the central plot. As a result, the reader feels like there is no end in sight.<br /><br />The writing style may be beautiful, but it ultimately was about nothing. I felt no connection to the two dimensional characters. The content is trite and have been done better in the past.
B000063UR1|4.0|This proved to be a bit better than it  was the first time, I watched it.  I believe it is better than &#34;2001 a Space Odyssey&#34; because for one it is not quite as long and the main actor is much better.  The story is a plus for the greenies as they were growing their own vegetables and fruit.  The robots were quite interesting also.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The Ghosts of Maple Creek is one of the best hidden object games I've played. Like many similar games, it got a little long in the tooth toward the end with a lot of back and forth, but the authors did a really great job (way better than most) connecting the dots and tying up loose ends throughout the game. Well done!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Very exciting, good story twists, all around good show for everyone. I would highly recommend this movie, especially to fairy tail lovers
B00005JKGK|5.0|If you have read The Joy Luck Club, then this is a must for you. It covers to book well, it's a good one for you're collection.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! I only recently got intothe zombie books and this one is the beat one yet.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sci-fi or a good zombie novel. I hear they are making a movie about this book and I have no.idea.ho..they plan to do that but I look forward to seeing how it turns out.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I purchased this apt on Jan 6. Have played it quite a bit and like it. Has a lot of options. I am at rank 131 and did not have to buy any coins. I do like it that the coins regenerae after a period of time
0470876417|3.0|The book and the mobile application fit perfectly well, but it's rather hard to apply what it says to some kind of businesses, such as services.
0425252868|5.0|Let me start by saying, I have never been the type of person who enjoyed reading about history so I wasn't sure how I'd take to this book. Well, what can I say other than WOW! I actual want to learn more about this war cause honestly I never paid much attention during school. This story has captured my mind and my heart!! Well written.. It is a MUST READ!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really am getting good at this game because I play it every night before bed.Makes me sleepy and relaxed..
B00000IZOR|4.0|I bought this for my 8 month old. She loves holding it as though she's talking. I know that she will be able to play with this toy for quite awhile.
B00000J0O2|4.0|Arrived in a timely fashion, hard-to-find item, packaged appropriately and good price.  Hope more are available when we need to order again.
B0063GORYU|3.0|It has a few hiccups. The cards will transfer to places you did not send them. But, for a free game, it's OK.
B00755MHXG|5.0|A story well told. I believe it is a book that parents can read along with young children and discuss. Good one to start a tradition of family book club!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the end of this book the best!!! My favorite part was during the games. I think it was way better than the first!
B001EBWITA|4.0|Pretty good movie. At the beginning it was hard to get Amazon connection but then it started playing at good pace. I will recommend the movie, it is awesome!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Grisham's The Racketeer.  This book is especially good with a great plot and surprise ending.  It is a page turner and definitely hard to put down once you start reading.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Fast read, couldn't wait to see what happened next, and loved the magic of it! I also liked imaging what happens after the book ends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a very cool app.... though the saddle and outfit sets are a little pricy, and how many horses can you get?
B004QK5N5W|5.0|lo recomiendo ampliamente tremendo vendedor cumple con todos los requisitos y requerimientos exigidos para vender en esta pagina muy bueno
B003JTHXOK|5.0|By far my second favorite Nicholas Sparks book! After A Walk to Remember of course. Can't wait to see the movie!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Best Coin drop game out there.  Love all the prizes and progression of the game.  It's very addicting.  Highly recommend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app cause horses are awesome and it is a fun game when ever I'm bord I always want to play this game
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My 7 y/o & 3 y/o love My Little Pony and love this game too!  Very easy to learn to play.
B004OO4UFY|4.0|Great combination of soul old school R & B and rock. Love how do you like me now. Definitely worth a listen.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I love the actors, the settings are gorgeous, but I could do with a little less melodrama.  Honestly, the writing is the only flaw I see with this series.  Its so over the top sometimes, it comes off as a little campy.  One catastrophe after another.  People don't watch Masterpiece to get a soap opera fix.  Just sayin'.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this app! The graphics are great and the music is fun. Be prepared to get addicted to this - Subway surfers is our new favorite app!!!! Try it and you will love it!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is very entertaining and enjoyable.  We all get involved in their lives, trials, and tribulations.  The history is interesting too.  This is one of our favorites.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|This final entry in the trilogy was weak.  Compared to the second-which would be hard to beat by any measure, this one was just lame.  I was very disappointed...
0981951252|5.0|This book changed the way I think about issues that I have been concerned about such as finances, weight management and personal issues.  Mr. Hardy put it on the line.  We are really in control, just need to be accountable and to find our MO.  I haven given this book as a gift since reading it.  I have the audio in my vehicle and turn it on every time I drive anywhere.  I have listened to it about 3 times now.  I learn something new every time.  What a great self-help manual.  I give it 10 stars-a perfect 10 for sure.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Some Nights is my fave song on this disc, but most of the songs are really good.  I like it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series and glad it was purchased for our personal home use. I have made my family members followers of the great series. Thank you Downton Abbey!
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|This is such a bizarre story that it's hard to believe it happened.  Ben Affleck, John Goodman, Kyle Chandler, Alan Arkin and others put together a plan to rescue some Canadians from Iran in 1979 or so by pretending to be a film crew scouting locations for a sci fi movie called Argo.  Really.  And it works.  The suspense will make your palms sweaty as they try to get them out of the country.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|Theron was mean as all get out but she filled her character role as best as her role required. I loved the cinematography for a great fantasy story. I watch it often to see things I may have missed...still finding little things that make this a great movie
B009AMANBA|4.0|Not that there is anything wrong with talking or speeches, inherently.  It's just that the political  ones in this movie tend to make it drag a bit here and there.  But you will enjoy the performances by all involved and watching the  major changes that happened at that time in our history.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is by far the best horse game on the amazon app store!!! The only thing it needs is more horse breed choices, like some of the other apps....but other than that its the best!!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This has a great ensemble cast who must sing live and raw as they tell the long tale that spans many years in 19th century France and involves revolution, love, heartbreak, vengeance, humor, and more.  The raw vocals will not be t everyone's liking, but I enjoyed all of them, from the young girl playing little Cosette to Jackman and Crowe sparring as Valjean and Javert, respectively.  It will be even better to watch it at home so you can take breaks as needed instead of missing part of it in the theater.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Okay, so it's not perfect, but it's so engaging and enjoyable that I can't resist giving it 5 stars anyway.  It's often a struggle to make myself read, but I picked up this book and read the entire thing in a day, then a few days later went back and read it again.  An immensely likeable protagonist, interesting supporting characters, and a slow, painful but rewarding journey from delusion to reality make this a great read.  And for what it's worth, it's (unsurprisingly) far superior to the film based on it.  If you liked the film, or even if you didn't, check this out.
B009YQJ322|4.0|...or maybe I do.<br /><br />This was a movie I looked forward to for a long time. A real Judge Dredd movie, not the version with Stallone. I don't hate the first film (though I hate the formulaic role Rob Schneider played) but it doesn't feel true to the source material. For the benefit of some commenting here, the source materials are the 35+ years of Dredd stories. There is no connection between the two movies.<br /><br />This new film is much better than the earlier one. The setting was great, the villain was convincing and I liked Urban and Thirlby. The idea of the judges being on the defensive worked well as did how the conflict gradually escalated.<br /><br />What I didn't like are probably some of the same things that kept the movie from being a big box office success. A little blood and violence can add to a story, but showing someone get shot through the head in slow motion is too much for me and is not going to garner a large mainstream audience. There were far too many graphic gunshot wounds, and the death of the villain really made me cringe.<br /><br />A 3D-only release probably didn't help the film's box office either (at least where I live there was no 2D, and 3D gives me a headache). Reminds me a bit of the reception Serenity received. Another good movie that didn't seem to catch on. Something tells me a sequel will not happen anytime soon.<br /><br />Even so, when I at last got my hands on the 2D disc, I enjoyed it so much I watched it through twice, back-to-back. Definitely recommended!
B007THA4FI|1.0|It was about the dumbest book I have ever read. Would not read her books again, She needs to stick with fantasy
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!  It's fun and you don't have to buy extra coins.  Great for kids and adults.  Can be addictive.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A great love story !  A story that is often too hard to understand.  Could not put this book down!
0547884591|5.0|Humans like Timothy Ferriss make me feel a bit ashamed of myself at first.  But then as you continue to seek him out in all media, you find someone wanting to help himself while helping others. That s*** is amazing. He is so down to earth. I first heard of Tim way back in my RKC days. I recommend all of his books to everyone. He dissects so many things on so many levels. He is a true forward thinker as you can find on his guest appearances on the Joe Rogan Experience and London Real. I will do anything to help this movement of great thinkers.
1451696191|5.0|My daughter felt it was a good read and then saw the movie. Good book for young teenage men. Good
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very realistic best horse game out there this is a must have I love it great for children if you dont like it there is something wrong you once again I love it
B006MW3V6U|5.0|so far it has been a great movie to watch hopefully it continues to be so basiclly it shows lifes struggles

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I liked it and I'm looking forward to next one so please make Jeff because I love these books and everyone read them in my school

B005LAIISA|4.0|I have all the other Ice Ages, so I couldn't wait to get this one. But it wasn't as goood as the others.Delivery was wonderful, as usual.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Love this. All packaged in one makes keeping track much easier. Fantastic price for all 8 movies. So glad we didn't purchase them individually.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|it was good but could've been a little bit better than the first or second book. still was a good last book of the series
B00008YZYM|5.0|We bought this used for my daughter. Very impressed no scratches plays very well.. I love used DVDS Makes it easier for us to afford all the movies my kids want...
B004BSFSTA|5.0|These headphones are great.  Great value for the price, I have no complaints. Work just as good as the more expensive headphones.
0425252868|5.0|I purchased this book for my parents for Christmas - as my Mom is a serious history buff and my Dad flew planes, etc.<br />They could not put this down - they were sneaking off to read all the time.  My Mom cannot read anymore - poor eyesight, so my Dad read aloud the entire book.  They would share with me each chapter - sometimes with laughter but mostly through tears.  It really brought the image of war home - very personal - even to me who was just told about what they read.<br />Would highly recommend to anyone - especially older adults who lived through and remembered this war.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Toy Story is one of my favorite series and they did it yet again with Toy Story 3. Buy it!!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|The actor they chose to play Dredd, Karl Urban did a better job filling the role than Stallone. Don't expect an intricate story but as far as action movies go, this one is solid.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|First book I've read from Courtney Milan and I love her style. She hits the sweet spot of romance, thrilling plot and sexual attraction between the hero and heroine. Looking forward to reading more!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I bought it for my new Nexus 7 and it fits perfectly and I get lots of compliments on it. I love the feel of it too.
B008M721MS|4.0|I got Skype in my kindle fire HD. Video is amazing i love that. But i have just recently tried to use my Mic it doesn't work u can hear the people in the other line but they can't hear me. The Mic used  to work until I upgraded Skype to version 3.Which is what i have now. Other than that I love it.
B009DA74ES|4.0|Hello. It was rong region code(1). So i cant play it on my DVD player. There was no info about that when i placed my order. :(
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is my second time reading this book/ trilogy... and I could read it again! I love Christian's character.... you will fall in love with him in this book!
B000002HJD|5.0|I've the vinyl version of this outstanding stuff, but hadn't heard for a great lenght of time owing to this & that with life in general.  But it's one of those master peices that was never recognised as so by the commercial world and its sad inhabitants for what was and how it spoke out.  Lyrically & musically it's  outstanding stuff (well it was the Doors).<br />Profound was Morrison's mind, drug induced or not, &#34;as was his Hotel&#34;.  And the people that he often sang about lived to multiply and brought us Bay City Rollers, then Take That and the Britians Got Talent grew.  But regardless, life goes on & on as does all good albums; (and this is one of them!)
B002A9VJ40|4.0|Saw this movie years ago and it is still a classic.  It is so good the Navy should use it as a recruiting tool.  Makes you want to go Mach 2 with your hair on fires.  Love it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this game! Great graphics! There are lots of activities to do, and the competitions are fun. I recommend this game!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|1) Movie is fantastically done on every single aspect<br />2) Tom Hardy and Guy Pearce do a great job<br />3) This and ARGO were the best movies in 2012<br />4) Guarantee you will like it.
B007RI56NY|5.0|My favorite songs were &#34;California 37,&#34; &#34;50 Ways to Say Goodbye,&#34; &#34;Bruises,&#34; and &#34;Drive By.&#34; Over all, this was a great album.
086571701X|5.0|This is a very impressive book that is packed with everything I need to know to set up my own aquaponics system.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Slow moving and seemingly pointless story.  I bought this book because of the immense popularity and success of her Harry Potter series. This is a disappointment.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|it keeps u thinking as u try to increase your skill level and try to get three stars. Addictive and good brain exercise.  Fun too.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a cute book! I think it would be good for young adults. I loved that they always practiced safe sex and waited until they were in love.
B007PFD90G|3.0|One would like to have more empathy for Rushdie, but the writing evokes so many other emotions that this reader's feminist sympathies find unpleasant, that reading all the way through, as I did, left me disappointed.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|If you have a smart tv what do you need this for? This app requires a wifi tv and a wifi feed to stream movies but it only works wih WiFi smart tv that can accrss the wifi on its own.  My tv that works with this program will allow you to find every thing my phone can without my phone so what is the point!  My phone and an hdtv cable is more useful than this app cause it can stream netflix to the tv over 3g or 4g.  Waste of time and space.

My wife and I have both downloaded this on to our kindled, and we are both addicted to it - my wife in particular. I have a handheld solitaire game that I play all the teams, until I got this. Now instead of picking up my handheld game, I pick up my Kindle instead.

0812975219|5.0|Superb exposé of our human proclivity to under-estimate -even disregard- randomness and the all-important and pervasive role of chance in most of our endeavors.  Very uuseful guideline in a number of fields, notably medical, where we so often fall for the explanations of physicians who don't really understand statistics.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Fringe took a healthy dose of the X-Files and put a very interesting spin on it. I really enjoyed the first season.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Very helpful. A condensed version of The Secret. Slightly repetitive but it really gets the message in! I reccomend highly!
B000V86OKG|5.0|I got hooked with the first season and have been working my way through all of the seasons. This is a very good series to watch by buying the seasons on DVD.
B003KRLKHC|2.0|Never pulls you in or makes you feel anything for the characters... But a good conceptand Gary OldmanOldman is always entertaining.
B004TI5N38|5.0|`love the pace and military cid investigator - along with the methodical thinking of the Army agent.  Please write more!!
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|If you already have a W.H. cd collection you may not want to buy this because these are just re-releases but  if you are a die-hard fan you won't care.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Found this after reading her other books - the slammed series. Loved it! Funny, emotional, and good outcome that keeps u guessing and leaves u smiling with tears in your eyes!
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|It's an entertaining game, it just takes some time to build the village. Also the padding between buildings is a little big so it's hard to pack the buildings into the area given, so expansion is necessary pretty quick. If you stick with it you'll be hooked.
098357670X|5.0|I love drawing i love learnig and Tom its amazing, you learn a lot with this book. And the artwork inside its sick!
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Great movie, with an upbeat story! Even though it is about sports it is still a good movie for girls!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Love, love, love it! I watch it over and over and still can't get enough of it. Amazing cinematography! Must Buy!
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|Really liked the movie as a mindless jaunt but no real substance and predictable.  Lawrence is excellent in the movie and was the reason my wife and I wanted to watch it but everyone else in the movie was sort of a let down.
1452101248|5.0|The book review of Jerusalem encouraged me to make that purchase. When I was going over the reviews, I discovered that Plenty preceded it and because it was vegetarian, I ordered both at the same time. All the recipes look great and all  need is time to make some.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Engaging fun and great for kids to learn just what it takes for a city to run. great to pass the time.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is epic on my first try I got 6/8 pages and on my second try I got again 6/8 pages and on last try on this game of 8/8 pages it was so awsome for me but once I won I turned around he was right in my face so it was game over but I still won the game it's a pretty scary game I recommend this game to any body who likes scary games like pewdiepie if he actually owns a kindle fire also to me the game was even more scarier because I have a kindle hire 7&quot; HD one so yhea get the game it's as creepy as hell.
630463949X|2.0|The concert looked great and you could tell all the members were glad to be there and performing again.  The only downside is you can barely hear it due to a terrible audio inlay.  The sound quality on Youtube was better than on this DVD and it was Youtube that prompted me to get the whole concert.  If your a fan, you will love it no matter what, but this fan is severely disappointed.
B00884GR0W|3.0|so I started this game and it was awesome. But after puting in some time the game wont let me craft any longer. I have tried every thing and the problem only persists... please brush up the bugs and ill rerate to 5 stars.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|It's unlike any movie out there. I'd watch it again just to be more versed in the time travel stuff.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thought The Fault in Our Stars was terrific and well written. I believe Hazel and Augustus were both realistic and heroic. The Fault in Our Stars will make you feel a turmoil of emotions while not becoming too lengthy lengthy or boring. Well done John Green, very well done.
B009MXSWI8|4.0|No CGI, no huge sets, just a cabin, five people and the horrors of the lonely woods. Still scary after all these years.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars because I'm a huge Sci-fi fan and this movie also comes with a lot of action.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Easy reading and the man woman relationship is real world and enjoyable. A few unexpected turns and bumps keep it interesting..
6305212112|5.0|the game showed up in time for christmas. works great. no complaints. i wish that all of our purchases were this easy.
B001NHN7TU|5.0|i saw this movie in the theater when i was a kid.  i loved it.  it has a great humor.  it may not be a critic's choice, but i get a kick out of it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|There just probably just fake. Subway Surfers is a great game, and none of those things happened to me. So 5 stars subway surf! Keep it up!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun and addicting  game.  Gets really challenging as you progress.A little too small for android phones as you reach the more challenging games.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's at least better then Alexander Polanski s game.(anyone with me???) So that the reason I gave it 5 stars
B004FRX0MY|4.0|This is good app to store most, not all my music (only because I haven't paid the $25 annual fee). Great playback. It would have gotten 5 stars but it has an tendency to give playback errors or sometimes have connection issues on all sources (PC, tablet or cell). If that gets fixed would give 5 stars for sure!
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|A bug in the multiplayer is when i leave a game i strangely lose credits and i have another just to replace the ones i lost which is very annoying and i lost about 7000 credits because of this but i still like this game
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I purchased the Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Multi-Function (knife) Sharpener as an intended back-up tool should my Leatherman multi-function knife required sharpening. I wanted a compact knife sharpener that I could carry with me everyday in my backpack.<br /><br />The Pocket Pal meets all my expectations.<br /><br />From the advertising, I liked the versatility of this tool in being able to sharpen two types of knife blades; 1) straight, smooth edge blades, and 2) serrated edge blades.<br /><br />The convenient &#34;fold-out&#34; sharpening rod is for serrated blades, whereby you would stroke each serrated edge with the rod. The other two sharpeners are for course and finer edges.<br /><br />What you see in this advertisement is what you can expect to get. I like this tool very much and is comapct and lightweight for daily carry.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|A long time since I've read a book I looked forward to returning to.  Well written and recommended!<br />Good book club book!

B004Y042N8|4.0|Starts easy and slow but some have made me think and that is great.  This is a great tool to get kids to work things out as well don't let them give up it is a challenge but fun to boot to beat things you don't think you can
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|We bought a 3D tv and it's very hard to find 3D movies.  I don't think Netflix or Redbox have them.  Can't wait to see this one.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Give this a shot if you can't play music.  Its fun and makes you feel alot smarter than you are.  I love entertaining the kids with it as well as my mom who thought I would never learn to play anything

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great read, solid ending, wishing there were more books in this series! Suzanne Collins has done it yet again to no surprise.

B001NHNG64|5.0|My second book read in the Jack Reacher series. Another great book. Looking forward to reading the rest of them.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|I am sticking this out just to say I actually read the thing, but I am skipping some pages as fast as I can touch them.  The main plot is too obfuscated by endless diatribes about the church, the government, the battle at Watterloo, which are only tangentelly related to the main character.  All in all, I'd say this classic is quite BORING!  Tale of Two Cities and The Count of Monte Cristo are somewhat similar, but much better reads.
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|Victor Frankenstein is a young geek who likes to make home movies and tinker with science projects. His pet dog, Sparky, is his best friend and the star of many of his home movies. One day Sparky is tragically killed and Victor is just emotionally crushed. How can he go on without his best friend? Inspired by a science teacher's imagination about life and reanimation, Victor plans an experiment to revive Sparky from the dead....<br /><br />This film is a spoof of the Frankenstein movies and books of our childhood and comes from the creative mind of Tim Burton. It is a cute but weird story and the characters in the film are interesting and funny. We watched the movie with our grandson and he loved it. The movie was entertaining and we all enjoyed it. It was made in all black and white and this is Tim Burton's creative side coming out and a parody of the original Frankenstein movie but I wished the disk had a color version on it as well. I believe I would have enjoyed it more.<br /><br />I rated this film as a 4 star movie.
B009MFKO3M|5.0|It's tough to exceed expectations. Following up their first major success, InnerSpeaker, I was skeptical. Lonerism brings it and I can only say Fantastic.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I enjoy all of Jack Reacher stories.The action and cases are great.And there is a little romance thrown in.I like the thought processes of figuring who did what.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Jean Duncan.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is awesome just like the rest of the books. I have already finished the series but they were so good I have to read them again

B00280LYIC|5.0|Fun read first book I read on my new kindle  Thank you for such a fun story will read more
B001IUVURS|5.0|One of the best studies of human nature I've ever read. It deals with motivation and betrayal in ways that no novel before and since has ever quite done so. And it's a damned good story besides.
0812993292|4.0|THE UNLIKELY PILGRIMAGE OF HAROLD FRY by Rachel Joyce<br /><br />Harold Fry, the most ordinary of ordinary men. Early sixties, very recently retired, in a loveless marriage full of regrets and bitterness, Harold is merely existing rather than living. Every day is the same and there appears to be nothing to look forward to or a variation in the daily routine. He is probably typical of many men, and women for that matter, who get to a certain stage in life and seem to either forget how to live, run out of steam, or are so stuck in a rut they can't see any way out.<br /><br />One day, just like any other, a most surprising letter arrives for Harold from a former work colleague, Queenie. Queenie is terminally ill, in a hospice some 600 miles from where Harold lives. It is not until the end of the book that the reader learns of the significance of the relationship between the two, which perhaps makes his actions at the beginning of the story rather surprising. Harold promptly replies to Queenie and determined for it to be in that day's post, proceeds to walk to the nearest post box to post it. And he simply keeps walking, deciding after a chance encounter with a young girl in a burger bar, that such a letter needs to be delivered in person, that Queenie needs to remain alive until he can deliver his message, and so he keeps going, and going and going.<br /><br />Now 600 miles at even 7 miles a day is still 85 days of walking! Clad in only boat shoes, a light waterproof, and no cell phone, somehow, against all sorts of odds Harold walks 600 miles. And there are plenty of odds. Initially Harold is quite incapable of looking after himself, and so is forced to rely, unexpectedly, on the kindness of others he meets along the way. Gradually his resilience builds, both physically and mentally, and he becomes quite adept at meeting the challenges his long walk throws up. Once that happens he finds himself with plenty of time and space to reflect on his life, contemplate his mistakes, his regrets, his marriage, his efforts at being a parent, Queenie herself, and his relationships with the people he meets on his journey. Until, by the end of the book, the Harold at the start has evolved into a completely different Harold. As has his wife Maureen, left at home alone, who also undergoes her own life reflections process.<br /><br />And does he make it to see Queenie? Not telling...<br /><br />This is such an inspiring story, with all sorts of issues being covered, not necessarily exclusive to people approaching old age - retirement, grief, changes to long term intimate relationships, apologies that need to be made, terminal illness, depression, physical decline - but  certainly very prevalent from perhaps 60 years old onwards. Not being of that age yet, but seeing how many older people do get to live in rut, reading this book has made me more determined that I will not let it happen to me.
B0098460O4|5.0|Beautiful, calming music. Soothes my soul. These two young people have touched my heart with their gift of song, their amazing talent, and their courage. I will continue to support them with each album they offer. They are the best of the best!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love it as much as computer, very similar if not the same. Highly suggest buying it's worth it. I'm sure other reviewers say the same.
B002BWP49C|5.0|This is a good movie to watch, but you have to have seen the other ones before this.  Great wedding!!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book started out a lot different then some of the authors other books, but turned out really good. Very complex and intriguing story!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I finished this book in two days. I could not put it down! Great story with some very realistic elements.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game and find it a challenge to move on and upwards!!!!!!<br />I play on my Kindle Fire and it's great!
0596009208|5.0|Very different from the school books I was used to.  Then again went back to grad school after 25 years!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and I was laughing so hard my belly ached. I just couldn't stop laughing. It was so random, inventive, funny and even endearing all at the same time. And I absolutely loved the random pop culture references, even though I've never seen Flash Gordon (I want to now!), I appreciated the reference and the cameo! The actors all delivered great performances. This is definitely a great movie if you just want to kick back and have a good laugh.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Game is thoroughly engaging and well designed. Graphics are intricate and charming. Entertaining for kids and adults. No rotation feature in editing and editing feature is in an obscure place. Also had to reload game after my tablet froze up while playing and suddenly the game refused to load.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really awesome game I recommend this to anyone that likes horses or animals. get it and you will have fun.
B00B2LFUGA|5.0|I love this show.  I enjoy the development of characters and the story lines that actually conclude to some satisfaction.  it's believable, makes sense, and is such fun to watch.  i love capers and shows like suits, and white collar.  it's so nice to have this as an option to the nudity and violence of other cable shows!  i am one happy viewer.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I bought this form Micro Center in Houston Texas for a much cheaper price. When I installed it in a ASUS P8Z77-V I crossed my fingers and let it boot. Windows 7 64-Bit installed to a Crucial SSD 128GB. Great performance! I came from a i5-760 with EVGA GTX 480 SLI (also with an SSD from Crucial). Has great media editing performance, doesnt get to hot running prime 95 with a Cooler Master N520 and some artic silver 5. It runs maxed @ 4.92 GHz and 149.9F stable in an 65F degree environment. It is housed in an Xigmatek Elysium with no current discrete graphics. The Intel HD graphics 4K work very well HDMI to a 55' Samsung. Just need a couple of Blu-ray drives form Asus, Vengenance memory form Corsair, and at least 2 [[ASIN:B009T3LKNA EVGA GeForce GTX660 Ti FTW Signature 2 2048MB GDDR5 192-Bit, Dual DVI-D, HDMI, DP and 3-Way SLI Ready GPU Graphics Cards 02G-P4-3664-KR]]. Well maybe 3 cards. over all its recommended!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I loved it and couldn't put it down! I am off to find another game by G5!  The puzzles are fun and challenging all at the same time. I would totally recommend!  Have fun :)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a incredible fun challenging game. Worth every penny. The only Android game I play.  Highly recommend this remarkable game.
B008JF8O9M|4.0|i cant get it to work but others can so get it and tested it your self yep ok by
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am so happy this game is finally available for the Kindle!! This is a great little game for horse lovers - though I think little children may have a hard time grasping the concept.  Would be ideal for older kids to adults.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|i think this app is great i really like it. im tired of parents complaining about their 4-5 year olds purchasing large amounts of gold and gems. it is the parents fault for not having parental controls set in the first place. if ur letting a little one play, supervise them! it is not that hard.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves them! We have read them together and we are almost finished with Mockingjay! They are awesome books and we both love them and would recommend them to anyone!
B008S7EPXA|4.0|Anastasis feels more polished and speaks less in the ancient tone and voice Dead Can Dance has offered before.  I find many of the tracks appealing as movements in a really epic movie score - especially the Brendon Perry vocals.  This effort is successful in rendering a sumptuous variety of tonality and rhythm leaving the listener wanting more.  I heard some of the first samples from this CD on &#34;A Darker Shade of Pagan&#34; podcast, and the avid listener should go there for premonitions of like music in the future.
B0009X7664|5.0|This is the best movie ever made.....so ahead of its time and it was a great pkg for the price
030758836X|5.0|I thought it was just another predictable book, then the surprises just keep coming.  It is well written with plenty of unlikable characters.  I really enjoyed it but hated it at the same time.  Great book
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A great collection of characters in a different setting. India became one of the characters which is a measure of the success of the story telling.
0316223239|1.0|With all the hype I expected to at least be able to finish the book even if I didn't enjoy it all that much, but after the first chapter I was so irritated by the child's `voice' I simply couldn't go on. It was hard to follow & felt too simplistic for such a serious subject. I wish I could have liked it because the book was a gift, but I'm glad I didn't spend my own money on it. Could be the story was plucked from the headlines of a real-life drama, but if so it deserved better. Prose? What prose? There is nothing to recommend this book in any way whatsoever. Except maybe the pretty cover.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|Coolest game I have this is awesome but I am missing 600 credits for the big truck I need my credits please quit using my account for your games

B005LAJ17M|5.0|This is a well done series that will keep you at the edge of your seat the whole time.  I went through Season One rather quickly as I couldn't wait to watch the next episodes.  Now, I can't wait for Season 2 to come out.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|you have to get this game i like the first i love the second one i recommend everyone to get this game
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|I found this animated film to be very enjoyable.Seems the only way I can watch an Adam Sandler movie is if he's drawn.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in this book. I think JK Rowling has spent so long writing for young people she is stuck there. There are a lot of teenagers in the book, and they dominated the story. I am not interested in reading about teenage boys masturbating or having sex in strange places. The premise of the story is good, but I think the author lost sight of the fact that it was for adults.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Great app finally can show pics from my phone on my Moms tv:) she was so amazed with this technology
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book keeps you guessing and is so wonderful that I can't wait to read the next two!<br />Two thumbs up for Maggie Stiefvater!

B009POCG5Y|5.0|Wonderful moview, a must see!  Clint Eastwood and crew provide you with a great story and a feel good movie.  Loved it!
B004Y042N8|3.0|ok but nothing great. Pictures could be better and a little harder. Overall a time killer and nothing more. I will keep looking.
0800187814|3.0|My fault for not checking that it was a tape instead of a CD. Now I have to find a tape player to watch it.
B008KEQMDC|5.0|I got this movie to give as a gift for a 14 years old girl, shelved it, I would love to get the movie for myself as well
B0089EHWQE|5.0|What a different read! Characters were developed well, ending surprised me, and the writing is good! I would recommend this book.
B003WUYP56|5.0|Pure Enjoyment, and Enlightenment.  It furthered my knowledge in Science.  This area of knowledge is my main interest, and area of discovery.
B00770KR7W|5.0|Sturdy and just plain neat for any age Halo fan.  In this case, a 13 yr old boy that asked for action figures for Christmas...never expecting to open Halo 4 Master Chief with Assault Rifle!  Needless to say Grandma will be ordering the rest of the bunch. Arrived timely and well packaged for shipment amid the annual rush to &#34;git'er done&#34;.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Sweet movie with Eastwood humor thourghout.  Enjoyable over a bowl of popcorn and good company.  I how have to write 5 more words.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Suzanne Collins pulls you into this world and makes makes you part of it.  You feel invested with all the character.  I look forward to the next book
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I could not put it down, yet wondered why.  After reading his first four books I learned not to to get invested in characters. Martin's way of creating surprises seems to be to kill off  characters at a brisk pace.  The world he has created is diverse and difficult to follow at times.  Perhaps. because this book run parallel with the previous  book it seemed as if the author is cleaning up loose ends as times.<br /><br />Over all, if you liked the first four books, you'll like this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put this book down. Have not read a book in a long time that had me wanting more. Great read!!
B00447G29S|5.0|I have bought a number of 3D DVD products for my new 3d TV.  Have enjoyed most but must say that the 3D added a lot to this film.  Bought for my grandchildren to watch around Christmas but watched myself first.  Liked the trailer showing how Tom Hanks made this film playing multiple roles (kid, Conductor, Santa, Hobo).  Did wonder if the 3D would add much but think it does.  Especially the rollercoaster ride scenes.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I literally just finished Hopeless 5 minutes ago, and I ran to my computer to write this review while I'm still on my super sonic giddy high that this book left me in.<br />WOW!<br />Like always this book has been popping up all over my facebook wall to read!  I purchased it last night and read till 3 am, only to wake back up this morning to finish it off.<br />From the first page I totally got wrapped up in the story and characters.  I love when you feel like apart of the book because the Author makes the characters so real.  This could easily be a movie!  I hope one day that it is because it's amazing.<br /><br />I really enjoyed all the characters.  Did anyone else think of Blossom when \\"Six\\" came through the window??  I wonder if that was a coincidence! lol<br /><br />I really loved Sky, she was so funny and straight forward and I loved her relationship with Karen and Six, and how she dealt with Holder from the first moment till the last, she was a truely great character!<br /><br />Holder was such a heart throb!  I LOVE the bad boys, and the fact that he beat a guy to within a inch of his life, well that just does it for me;)  Not to mention he was beyond perfect in every way of this book, he was everything Sky needed.  He never let me down, he never made me mad, he just was perfect.<br /><br />Now this book had it's dark moments, but the moments in between are what made it.  They took twists and turns, and I was coming to my own conclusions the whole time, and yet they still suprised me!<br />There were some hilarious moments as well.  I love the ego bashing text messages, because I can relate to healthy humor in a relationship like that, I think it makes it fun and playful!<br /><br />\\"You probably faked passing out the other day, just so you could be carried in my hot, sweaty, manly arms.\\"<br /><br />\\"What do you do when you're bored? You don't have<br />internet or TV. Do you just sit around all day and think about how hot I am?\\"<br /><br />\\"Are you allowed to get pregnant yet?\\"<br />I laugh. \\"Nope. Not this weekend. Besides, you have to kiss a girl before you can knock her up.\\"<br />\\"Did someone not have sex education when she was homeschooled?\\" he says. \\"Because I could totally knock you up without ever kissing you. Want me to show you?\\"<br /><br />\\"That's all I need,\\" I say. \\"Well...I need the lamp. And the astray. And the remote control. And the paddleball game. And you, Dean Holder. But that's all I need\\"<br /><br />One of my FAVORITE parts of the book is when she sends a text to her best friend Six, but she accidentally sends it to Holder instead!  He walks back to the car and tells her that he's pretty sure that she just sent a text to him that was meant for someone else and she is sooo embarrassed, and the way he handles it is priceless!  LOVE that moment!!!!<br /><br />I loved the references to THE JERK,  the meaning of the tattoo was epic, this book it had me LOL, and I just really enjoyed everything little thing I read!<br /><br />It made me laugh so many times, smile, blush (a lot) and cry.  It hit all my soft spots, and I'm so happy I read this book, it's at the top of my favorites list!!!to get pregnant yet?\\"<br />I laugh. \\"Nope. Not this weekend. Besides, you have to kiss a girl before you can knock her up.\\"<br />\\"Did someone not have sex education when she was homeschooled?\\" he says. \\"Because I could totally knock you up without ever kissing you.

B006H5120E|5.0|Was not sure how the remastered and 3D revision would work for this film.  No, the effects are not that dramatic but when you take off glasses and compare 2D and 3D the difference is significant.  To me it added greatly to enjoyment of the film.  And all the extras included were great as well.  Nice package and if you have 3D and are on the fence on this I will say it is worth it.  Especially since price has come down since I ordered it.  Still think was good value!
B009EAO38C|5.0|I love New Age string and piano combos, not classical. This mp3 is delightful. I play it while typing text
B001V7UXG2|5.0|An excellent and humerous portrayal of England's landed and idle (sic) rich between the WW's.  If you prefer English humor of a more slapstick form, get Fawlty Towers, but this is watchable over and over again.  Four years worth of episodes.
1593072937|5.0|Quick read about 200 pages in an hour or so.  I saw the movie first then caught the books years later and whats truly amazing is how the movie actually captures the art of the novels.  The narration and dialogue are the best to me, then the characters and graphics come next.  Great read and I'm looking forward to reading the next ones.
B007D5E7C2|4.0|Tarentino's best.  The entire ensemble fill their roles a step above a normal performance.  One of David Carradine's last performances, and arguably his best.
B000OXHRRC|4.0|Russell Crowe is one of my favorite modern-day actors. Master and Commander, Gladiator, and a Beautiful Mind are all films I have enjoyed. My wife and I hadn't seen this one, and based on the trailer we decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />Max Skinner (Crowe's character) is introduced as a ruthless, insensitive, and unethical London investment banker. He discovers that a beloved uncle - with whom he has had no contact in over 10 years - has just died. The uncle hadn't updated his will in decades, and it's determined that Max is the closest next-of-kin. So Max is the sole heir to the French vineyard his uncle owned.<br /><br />Max had wonderful childhood experiences with his uncle during summers spent at the vineyard, but his high-octane life in London has changed him. This makes him see the inheritance as a burden and an interruption. He travels to France with the intention of selling the vineyard.<br /><br />After spending time at the vineyard, and reconnecting with some locals, he starts having flashbacks of the times he had as a youth on the vineyard. He meets a hard-to-get local woman who becomes Max's love interest.<br /><br />This covers about the first half hour, and I have tried not to spoil anything. (If you want a complete overview, including a spoiler, go to the Wikipedia entry for this movie.) I will say that if the part of the story I have described so far sounds interesting, there are some twists in the rest of the movie that make the story even better and the ending somewhat challenging to predict.<br /><br />My wife and I enjoyed the film. Not Oscar-caliber, but a nice diversion, and one I would like to see again at some point.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This book was a very unique, inspiring, moving one overall. Some parts were quite dull, while others very intriguing, balancing out overall. Do not recommend for those who get sick easily, but, once again, a very good book overall!
B001JRB16U|5.0|very good:) One of the best movies both for a presentand we all very much  really liked the movie .
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I love the game but sometimes it doesn't save. but overall it is a good game and I like it.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Great condition great movie for people that love snow white must have item and really good movie condition was excellent
B008K6HN8I|1.0|What game are Amazon playing when they do not allow mere mortals over the Pond in the UK to install this app? Restricting it to the favoured few over there is a despicable act.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A really great action packed thriller that hooks you on. Recommend everyone to read it. BTW Reddit is awesome. IB
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Got for daughter as per her request as Christmas gift.  She loves it, all good!  Though she has seen each one before, she really likes having the whole set.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it. I like da graphics. And I like da fact ur not on a time limit to be back.
B000092T6M|5.0|Love this show.  My favorite Robin Hood show is this one.  I wanted to have a special copy so I could keep it put up and now I have it.  It is a good purchase, and a good buy.  The movie is great.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This game is a great game. Glu made this game a tactical based game instead of the usual hack n slash game they make like blood and glory, and it works well for this game. This game places you in feudal Japan unlike other zombie games, which places you in the old west or post-apocalypse world. The game can get frustrating at times and you can't go back to a previous wave but all in all it is a good game and if you are a fan of Glu's games or looking for a different kind of zombie game than the usual zombie game you should check it out.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Grand daughter loved this and also cried watching this each time she does.  Another one, and the last one to add to her collection of the Harry Potter movies.  Thank You Amazon.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Kate Morton is brilliant author the way she moves from different generations so easily is a real art the story was really great and kept your interest at all times
B0000B1OFL|5.0|I had been waiting for this movie to come on my hbo, shotime, or starz, but it never did.  So, I decided to look it up on amazon and purchase it.  Got it at a great price and it is well worth it.  A great movie.  Thank  you Amazon
B005HI4LLY|5.0|This was an under-rated movie. I and my friends, and my son and his friends, really enjoyed it. Great subtly funny scenes, great movie overall.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I could watch this show all day and never be tired of it.  It was one of thee best shows I have ever watched on television.  The time goes by on this show so fast.  So much going on and very in depth story line.  It is so true-type to life.  I love this show.  Very happy with this purchase.  I have all of the seasons.  The only one I do not have is the two disc dvd, Redemption.  I will get that soon.  Thank You Amazon.
B006YZOXHQ|4.0|Hanoi Jane in her pre-protest years. Very enjoyable for its funky, psychedelic, feel sort of like the magazine Heavy Metal before the film version. This is a good double feature with the 1980 Flash Gordon if you want to overload on funky kitsch!
B000FA57US|5.0|My grand daughter's favorite movie since she was way young.  She is only ten now.  I love these movies, but never dreamed of a grand child loving them.  It is fun to watch, the picture is great and the price is right.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is a great game, still has a few kinks but over all well done, also the game is very addictive!
B002PMV9FG|5.0|My grand daughter has been watching these movies since they came out.  She got me hooked on them also.  I love these movies, and she loved her gift.  Thank You Amazon.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I really liked it and thought it was as good this time as the first time I read the book.
0545128285|5.0|My grand daughter loves the Harry Potter Movies, and this book was in the &#34;Deathly Hallows&#34;.  And, of course, she had to have it.  She added it to her collection of Harry Potter Movies.  I have the books, she has the movies.  It is worth the purchase.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There are a lot of words that can be used to describe this book but the one that first comes to mind is heartbreaking.  I loved the book beginning to end and read it in a day.  I think Christian Grey might have some stiff competition in Dean Holder.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|This is a good movie.  I wanted to have a special copy(extra).  I love falling asleep watching this movie when I have a really bad head day.  Which is a lot.  It is a good buy.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is a nice way to relax or pass some time when I did not have much time or energy left to invest in something else.<br />It can be as challenging as you want to make it.
B002GHHHKG|5.0|This is a beautiful movie.  It is a great purchase, a good buy and worth watching over again.  I had to have this.  I could never catch it when it came on TV(HBO, Starz, ....etc.  Well worth the money, and not expensive.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Very funny. The Kids Really loved it and I enjoyed watching it myself. I got the feeling it might be the last one made.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|I have all of these movies, thanks to my grand child.  I also love them myself.  It is definitely worth purchasing and keeping for a classic halloween or scarey movie night.  The show has a great picture and sound.  It is a great purchase.
B00846REIS|3.0|I don't know if I would read the whole series when it comes out.. there is no set date for that
0345529057|5.0|This was another great buy from Amazon.  I read these books back to back and plan on doing so again.  The new season starts up real soon and I want to be polished up on the book as well as the movie.  The books are great.  I couldn't put them down.  If I find a good read, I have trouble getting it out of my hands.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|Leonard Cohen, if you know his stuff, is a very unique artest. He's has a bass or the very most baritone singing voice, that is truly a pleasure to listen to. The songs that he writes and sings are well chosen, to reflect his tallent. I always enjoy tistening to his selections every so often, to complete my music listening pleasure. I have three of his albumes on CD, all of which I enjoy thoroughly.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I got one of these for my son and one for me.  They work well.  Have had no problems with them at all.  Thank You Amazon.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Loved the movie. Loved the music. The Misty Mountain song was a must have for my collection of music. Great soundtrack.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Grand daughter loved this gift, as well as loving the movie.  She has all of these movies, and watches them frequently.  Good price as always.  Thank you Amazon.
B004EPZ00C|3.0|My 9 year old thought it was pretty funny and it was entertaining enough.. Recommend it for tween audiences. Fast delivery and product was as advertised.
0345803485|5.0|James broke new ground.  Went to a literary and writing workshop that wouldn't allow submissions of &#34;bodice rippers,&#34; only to find them announcing this book broke all records.  I had already read it as three friends whispered, buy this book.  Don't tell anyone I recommended it.<br /><br />  Of course it is poorly written.<br />  Of course it is a terrible take off on &#34;Twilight.&#34;<br />And Yet!!!!  I couldn't put it down.
B007712XAU|5.0|Watched series and am now watching season 3 on PBS, enjoy interaction between characters and quiet love. Language easy to understand
0345803493|5.0|Poorly written, predictable and still riveting.  I stayed with this writer through two books despite my fear and trembling at being found out.  (Reading this)  The third I gave up on.
B000LXH0AY|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE. it is one of my favorites and it makes me happy inside just to know that this site had it on stock. thank you for making my life complete!
B009MO57H6|4.0|I love the costumes, and the story continues on.  The only problem I have with this is not the movie, but the UV not being available in Australia. What's with that?
B003SQVI54|5.0|I love this little show ... they are so funny.  I love the twisted sense of humor.  You'll love it.
B009JZVT70|4.0|If for no other reason, this show is well worth the time and purchase just to watch Robert Carlyle transform from facet to facet as his character demands. He is the show as every other character is anchored by his performance. Not as manaic a perfomance as he gave in Train Spotting, but then again, we don't want him to be too scary.
B004N6369Y|2.0|It was a great book. Although it wouldn't let me open the ebook all the time and its annoying that they're making me write a review.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|For all the critisism that this movie has gotten since release, and cries of disappoinment from the fans of the &#34;Alien&#34; franchise, this is a very riveting movie. I've watched it three times, and while I don't regard it as a classic, mainly because of the over simplistic and none too intelligent story line, I find scale of the visuals and sound, and the great perfomances of Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender make for a very interesting 124 minutes.
0800141601|5.0|This movie was a brilliant retelling of the Arthurian Legend. Well written, well acted, and well-shot. Even well cast. However... is it really realistic that any woman would choose Richard Gere over Sean Connery?
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really liked this book and had it read in two days.  Had I started it earlier in the day, I may have finished it in one.  It had a really good storyline and I was anxious to see how it ended.  I was not disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It reels you in from page one. There is not a boring moment.<br />I can't wait to read  book 2.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle is a terrific talent.  It is difficult to review since I knew what I was getting.  Her music is so soothing.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Love Twitter, have it installed on all my devices.  If you use it all the time like I do, this is a wonderful app to stay connected with social media.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is better than the other shark games. I like how there is a large amount of water that you can swim in. your shark gets bigger as you level up so I would definitely recommend this app
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Fun game, you have to love those piggies, this game really makes you think and use some physics to get the pigs were they need to go.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Everyday one seeks meaning in their lives as they walk their journey in sunshine or through a wilderness of chaos. Meaning may be framed as giving purpose to our endeavors to understanding personal suffering. Meaning is as unique to each creation of God. Their are no easy answers or textbook formulas to follow in this search for meaning. As grace and faith are gifts, so is intuition a gift from the holy spirit that leads us to recognize a pattern in our lives that exemplifies a spiritual meaning. What is valuable from this meditation is the realization of 'who am I' - both tangible and intangible. Others are present in our lives so we can see ourselves in their reflection.I pray that I may open my  eyes, ears and heart for the answer to be found.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|While the story was somewhat compelling, it was sophomoric and the writing was poor and repetitive. I was sorry I bought it.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I like to play mahjong and was looking for a different interpretation. Well, this fits that bill! However, I usually play my games at night, before bed, so my eyes are tired. Moving this in a 3D space can be disconcerting. I found the colors hard to look back and forth from when turning and searching. But it's probably just old age!
B0087EVHTE|4.0|This chip for high end games is awesome! It has more than enough power to eliminate the cpu as any kind of bottleneck for modern games. You can certainly buy a more powerful chip but i will tell you that i have not found a need for anything more powerful. I use it to game and transcode video. My only SMALL gripe is that it does run a little warm with the stock cooler. I know you can buy aftermarket coolers and all but i didn't buy the k series for a reason i just want to put the chip in with stock parts and have it run relatively cool even under load. It's not terrible and isn't at alarming temps it would just be nice to run a tad cooler. Overall though awesome chip for the money and you should be set for a little while.
630469654X|5.0|I really wish they would release this film on Blu-Ray because the added resolution would truly bring home the magic this film holds in its visuals and storyline.  Ladyhawke is a truly wonderful film filled with action, humor, and a love story with a fantasy twist.  Watch it without reading anything else if you have never seen it.  Buy it if you have fond memories of the film.  Put it on one night and the theme song alone will transport you back and have you ready to relive the story.  Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer were terrific in this.  He epitomized the unyielding hero and she was sheer beauty.  This film and Ferris Bueller captured what a talent Matthew Broderick was.  Ladyhawke simply does not get the recognition it deserves.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Read for our book discussion group at the library. Slow starter but a lot of info.  Very thought-provoking. Can't wait to see the movie.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The packaging is very nice and durable.  Also comes with a book about the trilogy.  This is a perfect gift.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|I was expecting more considering all the hype I had been hearing.  It was a good story, but kind of simple and, I thought, a little far-fetched (in regards to what the grandparents did under the circumstances).  It's worth the read, but I was left feeling a little underwhelmed.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Really liked both season 1 & 2 of American Horror Story. It's like watching a horror movie, but through a TV show. Really like the quirky actors, too. Prefer watching on Amazon because there are no commercials. Enjoy!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought that this was just going to be a love/coming of age story and I wasn't too excited. It is so much more. It's a well written novel that was captivating. I couldn't put it down.  It doesn't disappoint and has a great ending.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|I have nothing to say that's not already been said, but I feel the need to shout my love for this series on the internet! I first picked this series up at the local library when I was in high school. I needed something to watch, and I had just finished Babylon 5. I was hooked on this series from the very first episode and quickly devoured all of them. I was so disappointed to learn that the series was no longer on the air. Firefly had the perfect blend of action, suspense, and perfectly-timed comedy. It's just a shame that most of my favorite series are short-lived sci-fi shows like Firefly, BSG, Dollhouse, SGU, etc.<br />This world does not like forward-thinking or morally-ambiguous shows, which is why I think most of them don't last very long. At least we managed to coax a movie out of them!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Great book! I could not put it down. I've read my share of books on vampires, witches, etc., but this one was different. Deborah Harkness has written that rare, intellectual story that combines science, history, folklore, and those creatures who live in the depths of our imaginations. I can't wait to start on the next book in the trilogy.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|i love the language of this novel and it's attention to detail. If you have seen the movie then the book will &#34;fill in  the gaps&#34; of the story.  The character developments are brilliant. It reminds us of the good in human nature .<br />I found it an easy and interesting read
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have little patience for non- functional media apps. I've tried other radio apps for sports and listening to radio stations across the country and found this one to be the most reliable.
1421550644|5.0|I'll keep this short.<br />Very good manga (Obviously i liked it if i went and bought the entire set.<br />I'm also very pleased with how it is presented. Nice solid hardcover books in a nice solid collector box.<br />Nothing negative to say.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great radar... It really needs a good hour by hour forecast.  This is my primary weather app. Happy with it for the most part.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT! I can hardly wait to read the next one! I love this series, makes me feel like I am there.
B0058VW36U|4.0|it is a very good game but is very hard to unlock levels and not very different from the free one
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Imagine in our society today if anyone was punished in the harsh manner that Jean Val Jean was punished for the crime he committed.  Moreover, someone (Inspector Javert) spending a life time in pursuit of a criminal for petty larceny.  A most inefficient use of taxpayer dollars.<br />The book is difficult to read, however it has a lot of interesting history.  I am only half way through the book, but I will continue because I have discovered things in this book that were not in the many plays that I have seen on this same topic &#34;Les Miserables&#34;.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Loved this from the start to finish; initially thought it was a little lame but 5 minutes later it kept me on edge for the rest of the movie with great special effects and lots of action.  Worth the $4 it cost to rent it!!
B009H1S56O|5.0|I was confused why it was disliked ? I got all the tracks and none missing . Everything I expected ! I was surprised it's sold here because in her website it's gone and I really wanted it . It's amazing ! Ahh glad i looked in here. Defiantly for the big ldr fans like myself
B004DM0UII|5.0|very very. very very very cool cool cool cool app app app app app I like so so so so much
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't stop reading! Romance with some mystery =the best book out there!<br />Strongly recommend this book to any one looking for a good read
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Not only is the music unbelievable in this movie, but the story line is beatiful and envolves all emotions. The movie focuses on relationships and how the power of a relationship can create amazing music and an escape from everyday life. The acting is brillant and the chemistry is perfect.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Has an unexpected twist but I loved this book. I read 200 pages in one sitting. Great read definitely. Don't pass it by.
B004QX07G4|2.0|This was for my wife, who is a big Ellen fan.  She was really expecting more substance, but all she got was a long winded monologue.  There's much love for Ellen in this house, just not this book.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|Did not like this at all. Once it was installed on my kindle I could not get it open. Made several attempt but it never worked. finnally had to uninstall it, and now I am a little leerly about geeting another camera app but I need one to use the camera on my kindle. so dissappointed!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A sad requiem for a wonderful child...this trilogy merits a small amount of concern for a future that is not that grim.
1118232658|5.0|There are rarely times in history where a content rich book is published in the midst of the very revolution that it is addressing. Typically, those books are written after the fact, looking back in time. Socialnomics looks forward. As the leader of a company that is in the midst of this very transition--from \\"creating and pushing\\" to \\"engaging and listening,\\" I found Socialnomics to be timely, informative and full of very useful, practical information and case studies. If you want to harness the power of social media for your business, read Socialnomics.
0765325950|1.0|Delaying ebook version and forcing hardback onto readers is purely about greed.<br />This decision has definitely stained the series' legacy in my mind. I'll just wait another three months to buy the ebook.<br />I hope that Brandon Sanderson was not behind this decision.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|This is a very cute maze game and it works well. However, I am stuck at level 28 and just can't figure out how to get to the cheese before the rat.<br /><br />Also, I'm confused about the menu. It shows up to level 29, and then it shows locked items starting at 62 -- and there are several 62s.<br /><br />Update: I finally solved level 28 as well as 29. The next levels are all locked and I don't see a way to unlock them .... ?<br /><br />There definitely needs to be some written instructions and explanation. I still don't understand what the fast-forward arrow does except that it seems to stop the game and start over!
1849904251|5.0|The case book is a great tie in to a wonderful series.  I love Sherlock's snarky comments!  I feel sorry for John!
1476719071|5.0|Shows in a realistic way how sometimes love can be like a drug with its highs of euphoria and lows of weakness.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|worth the price.  my daughter loved it and watched over and over and over again.  she is a 1D fanatic
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|It only got interesting at the very end...took too much time to get there.  I would skip the first half.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I wanted to read this book because I really enjoy Nicholas Sparks books and I saw this would be made into a movie in February. I have to say it is not like his other books, but it is now one of my favorites.
B003F3PMYI|3.0|The key point of the book is the questioning of the traditional formula: first success and than hapiness. Achor proposition is to look differently, be happy which will lead you to success. It is good to reflect how we want the world to occur to us, which has not a magic formula.
0061537969|5.0|This is an inspiring, heart-wrenching, funny, and sad novel that will enlighten and give hope and belief to any reader. Unique in that it's narrated by the dog, it provides a refreshing look at life from a different view. It was recommended to me after I lost my beloved dog, but I couldn't bring myself to read it for months because of my broken heart. When I finally did, I really wish I had read it earlier. And it is not so much about the dog, but about life itself -- philosophical in an unusual and unpretentious way. I have given it to many people facing various challenges in their lives in the hopes that they will benefit from the uplifting message it delivers.
B002361MLA|5.0|This is a book to read carefully, because although it is obvious that the past happened and doesn't exist and the future is yet to come, Tolle broght a conversation how we actually don´t live the present and what can happen if we do so.
0679746323|4.0|This book provides a clear and thorough history of the terrible reign of terror promulgated by Mao Tse Tung.  I was astounded by the amazing cold hearted and vicious actions this man perpetrated on the Chinese people.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|some of the greatest blues players ever telling some great stories.  Pinetop doing Grindin' Man has got to be seen and heard.
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|It is playable, but if you don't complete quests in the order they suspect, it will be buggy.  I accomplished part of a quest before the quest was given to me and everything but the start island disappeared and was covered in clouds.  Now I can't advance.  Still a decent time waster, so it gets 2 stars.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Excellent ,realistic graphics, scenery, movement and beautiful horses to have fun with and take care of.  Lots of choices available with care, even mixing the feed and wiping down your horse. Now that I've quit playing after many games I can report that the many times the game would not open were very annoying. This game also encourages you to spend real money to progress levels.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Follows the Clancy tradition of multiple characters and intertwined plots all going to the same end. As always a solid read.

B00A9X9TIW|3.0|AS WITH MOST SIFI, IT HAS SOME PLOT FLAWS, BUT IT'S WELL ACTED AND FUN TO WATCH, SO I WOULD/DO RECOMMEND IT TO ANY SIFI FANS.  IT'S NOT GOING TO KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF, BUT IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH WATCHING.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great read. Love the story line. With there where more books that went with the set. I will recommend this to everyone

B0084IT59C|5.0|The back story here is truly sad.  Incredibly funny, very well written.  We are very lucky that this novel came to the attention of Walker Percy and that he got it published.  Too bad we won't get any more from Toole.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As a retired Navy pilot and having touched briefly on some of the events described in this novel, I would say that Mr. Clancy is very well informed.  His writing style is riveting.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I was so into it I was shocked when it ended. You're a great writer, James. Keep on going, man.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this game on my kindle fire and I can't stop playing it. Very good quality and highly entertaining. Love it!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|It is challenging, but fun! I love this, but I think it is best for an elementary school age. I still love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I haven't been able to put this game down. I love it and it is so much fun and addicting!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was an emotional, thrilling and amazing book . It had a huge unexpected twist, at the end of the book.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|When I watched season 1 I was instantly hooked. I fell in love with the story and the characters and everything about the show. I started season 2 hoping I would have that same feeling, but sadly I did not. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy the show alot which is why I rated it 4 stars, it's a great show and one of the few that I take the time to make sure I watch, it's just lacking a bit of the magic that made the first season so amazing to me.<br /><br />*May contain spoilers from this point on*<br />I think there are two main reasons that the second season failed to capture me as much as the first. The first reason is the characters. There are too many 'main' characters with their own stories within the main story and it's hard to connect with any specific character because as soon as you start to learn a little more about a character and become interested in them the show switches to another character and their story. Then by the time you get back to the character you were starting to like they've moved past that moment they cut away from.<br /><br />The second reason the second season doesn't live up to the first is because in the first season the story was all about Murder House and the family that has moved in and the people who never left. There was alot going on but it all revolved around this house and the problems inside it. But in season 2 there are so many stories that just happen to meet when the characters are put into close proximity of each other. First  you've got aliens, then there are demons, then there are Nazi war criminals and mutated experiments and a serial killer. How does this all fit together? Add in the flashes forward to the present time storyline and it's hard to see where they are trying to take the story. Its being pulled in too many directions and with only one episode left of the season I am not sure they can tie it all back together. I guess I will find out this week. If the finale is so amazing it changed my opinion of the seasonI will come back and amend my review.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It will certainly help to pass the time and it is fun to beat your last time.  I play it most days.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Fascinating and well written.  I had heard him on NPR and wanted to read it.  Wow.  I guess I only just wanted more detail about what he experienced.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|It was pretty good<br />I think it was cool but some of the things u have to have pets to unlock
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|At first I didn't really understand wat kind of game this was then I realized it was like a mini version of League Of Legends and I actually hate that game a lot but for some reason I like this one haha. Great game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What I didn't like about this one is that prim died. What I did like though is that katniss  and peeta fell in love again and got married, and had kids.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This review is for Amazons service, not a movie review. We all know the Dark Knight Rises rocks as a great finale. I pre-ordered the blu-ray and it showed up on time and undamaged. Amazon does good work.
0470601787|4.0|Too much to read, but concept good  Could have been shorter.  I have to go back & read it more carefully
0618154248|5.0|My daughter loves these books. She asks to be read them again and again. I will have to say that the Curious George Goes Fishing title is my least favorite. Kind of circuitous.
0307346617|2.0|Having enjoyed the TV series, The Walking Dead, so much I thought I'd venture into the literature a bit and chose World War Z to begin.  Ultimately, I wasn't impressed.  What I particularly disliked was the narrative style - a series of diverse post war interviews acting as a kind of supplement to the more official government account.  The problem, for me at least, was that so many different narratives (from different people all over the world) muddied any linear story line.  It would be one thing if the entries were a single individual's journal etc., but that's not the case here.  That approach has worked well with other horror novels (Dracula for one). But, the multiple narratives simply confused things for me and, to compound matters, the writing wasn't good enough to propel me over such hurdles.  Now, I can understand, perhaps, the logic of using this technique - multiple narratives are *supposed* to project confusion because that's how the author wants the events to be seen.  Nevertheless, as they say, you live by the sword and die by the sword - and, in my humble opinion, this book dies by the approach it chose.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a good game especially for HORSE LOVERS!!!!!!!!! and real like it seems like you are accually at a ranch!
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|this game is a joke its just for kids to feel good about not having Xbox or ps3 to play cod it also is a waste of money and instead should get minecraft
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|A fun way to pass a little time with an action adventure yarn . Good for Drs offices and other places were time is to be passed in waiting .
B00ADYY7MA|5.0|i have been a fan of &#34;nashville&#34; from the beginning.  the music and storylines have kept me eagerly coming back for more every week.  this soundtrack has quite a few of my favorite songs on it.  downsides?  there is at least one song, &#34;boys and busses&#34;, that i'd like to see on another soundtrack.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who is in a relationship.  Trying to understand your partner's &#34;love language&#34; is a vital component to a long healthy relationship.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Wonderful story wish the girl could have seen the horse at the end.<br />What heros they were. All should see this show.
B001EBV0NU|3.0|This was supposed to be a tribute to old B movies but it just feels like they tried too hard. There are a few funny parts but the movie but they don't make the movie too memorable.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A Helpful little app. Simple, but does what it says it will do.....which is all I need. And it is free!
B0094OLFUW|4.0|I first heard this group play on radio last summer. Awaiting this release, I picked up their 1st album. I liked their 1st just a little more - but this was good too.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|We recently started watching Homeland on a recommendation from friends - and we're totally hooked.  My wife and I put the kids to bed, then rush downstairs to watch the next episode. Great writing, terrific acting (there's a reason these guys keep winning awards!), chock full of suspense and unexpected plot turns - you won't regret watching Homeland.  Our biggest problem is going to be, what will we do in a week or so when we've watched all the episodes?
B0039TAHMA|5.0|I would recommend this to any family, but I think the child should be older than thirteen, this age may still be too young for the violence.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book and the stories.  I wondered how it was that I missed reading this when I was a kid.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is one of the best games i have ever played its like teen games in one! I cant wait to play the next one<br />Littledancer320@aol
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is one of the best games out now especially because its free and you can use powerful magic or be a warlord. Multiplayer is awesome to because you can play with friends or play against them. You can be a girl or a boy. Its awesome. Please get it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a fun but challenging game it has  great levels levels and I just love this awesome game. and I love this show and creating angame about it is even better!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Better then most of the hidden object games on the market.  Has a extensive story line.  The Colorado aren't to bright or cheesy.  Overall great game.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I travel several days a week, and this charger case is indispensable.  I can plug it in to a USB port on my laptop and keep my headset charged while meeting with customers.  Spending so much time in airports, I am always on the phone.  The Voyager Legend Charging Case has not let me down.
B005XLN97M|3.0|This was a gift to my daughter, kind of difficult to get it all put together.  She loves it though.  Beats the $200 barbie houses and both my 4yr old and 10 yr old play with it.
B004SUDPWI|5.0|I compared the DVD and Blu Ray versions of this movie and give the nod to Blu Ray for better clarity.
B006O6F932|3.0|My daughter is a huge monster high fan and had to have this for Christmas.  It was cheaper than at Wal-Mart, so I picked it up.  It was difficult to put it together and it doesn't fold up easily for any travel or storage.  While it made her extremely happy and she still plays with it, I as a parent wasn't all that impressed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves horses so she enjoys this game a lot.  It was very easy for her to learn and she spent a lot of time with it independently and without any actual purchases.
B007RE0RR8|3.0|It's like anyother monster high doll.  The only con I had was the shoes didn't seem to want to go on her feet.  Otherwise, my daughter loved it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|While it has similarities to the Hunger Games trilogy, Wool takes a new spin on the apocalyptic bicycle.  A good read for anyone familiar with this genre.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this game is very fun and sad because you have to kill mankind but this is also a good game because it allows you to make your own disease and name it what you like
B000TTRGUE|5.0|I've been videotaping product promos for three years now. I went from using lavalier mics, to shotgun mics, and most recently to this Behringer Ultravoice XM8500 hand held mic. I can honestly say that my clients have never sounded better. Full rich sound without the complication of having an on / off switch, or battery.<br /><br />Also for some reason it seems to focus more on my client's voices, while picking up less of the background noise at the conventions I shoot at.  Thank you for a great value!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Arrived quickly, great quality, and works great!<br /><br />This product is the same as the cable that ships with the kindle fire and that's exactly what we were looking for. Couldn't have asked for a better product.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|connected through ps3... perfect.. free?  .. now put 20 dollars in your pocket and head to the thriftshop cause this is eff'n awesome
B009VB7P6G|5.0|We are Tinkerbell fans in this house, and this movie did not disappoint! Very sweet, even if it was a bit predictable.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Best alarm clock i have, I would recommend this for anyone to download. Its bright and loud enough to hear.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Utterly charming!  A movie experience with terrific acting, wonderful ambiance, beautiful scenes, and unusual presence-- it will leave you smiling.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book literally kept me up all night.  Couldn't put it down.  My only problem lately with some of the better known authors:  The story line keeps you turning the pages, but I feel the author just doesn't know how to end the book.  I don't mean it's a &#34;cliff hanger&#34; but for some reason the ending seems too contrived.  I was just disappointed in the ending.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I have watched this too many times to count. Watch for Colm Wilkinson in the movie out now. And watch all the way to the end!
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Wasn't blown away by this book but it was an easy read with a simple but powerful message. I think I had higher expectations for it based on all the praise for the author.
1439130833|5.0|Very thought provocating daily reminders.  It really gets you to start your day off thinking. I would recommend it to others.
B00012QM8G|5.0|the whiners and bitchers, cranks and bellyachers who complain about this being a \\"flipper\\".  What the heck is the big deal?  Would you rather deal with two discs or just have to store one disc.<br />How much trouble can it be to flip a disc.  From the sound of the nit pickers it seems like they like to gripe about just about anything.<br /><br />This is a great movie.  Great acting.  Great scenes.  Great locations.  Great character faces.  What the heck more do they want?
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I had just come home from watching the movie so I ordered this.  I was blown away with the songs and the performances.
B009DA74ES|5.0|What more can I say besides-- it's the entertaining life of Hank Moody. Can't miss TV. Excellent! Looking forward to Season 6.
B000W1X0DQ|4.0|Being a big fan of Deep Purple and classic metal in general, I finally checked out the Dio-era Rainbow about a year ago.  It's really grown on me, and so I decided to move forward to the later Rainbow.  Now, at first listen it was a bit of a departure - the kind of mystical 70s early metal of the Dio years is totally left behind for a more straight-ahead Foreigner-like American 80s rock.  That said, it's a pretty good example of the style.  Admittedly the lyrics are often cliche rock lyrics (e.g. \\"Tite Squeeze\\"), but I can enjoy that kind of thing in the right context.  (And, heck, it's not like Dio Rainbow didn't give us \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\" and Purple had stuff like \\"Woman From Tokyo\\").  The distinctive guitar of Ritchie Blackmore, however, helps this stand apart from the rest of 80s mainstream rock, and the presence of Purple bassist/songwriter Roger Glover adds an extra incentive for Deep Purple fans.  Although the vocals in particular give it a rock vibe, Ritchie's guitar does add abit of metal undercurrent to the music that gives it a little extra kick.  I've noticed that Ritchie ended up stealing a few riffs from this and \\"Bent Out Of Shape\\" for Deep Purple's \\"Battle Rages On\\" album, while Bruce Dickinson borrowed the exotic melody of \\"Eyes of Fire\\" for Iron Maiden's masterpiece \\"Powerslave\\".  All in all, a really good 80s rock album full of Ritchie's signature guitar, although not in the same vein as Deep Purple and Dio-era Rainbow.
0393324818|5.0|Michael Lewis' insider's guide to general managing the Oakland As is exposition at its best. Now I need to go out and see the movie.  Hope it does justice to the book.
B00000J2SR|4.0|Well, I'm just getting into the 80s era of the band, and I haven't gotten \\"Difficult To Cure\\" yet, but I got the other 3 80s Rainbow albums for Christmas this year, and they've been in constant rotation for the past month.  I like this one a little better than the other two - it's got maybe a little more of a metal edge in some of the songs (while still being mainly in an 80s rock style), and I like the more prominent keyboards, too.  There's quite a few riffs that Ritchie would reuse for Deep Purple's \\"Battle Rages On\\" (particularly \\"Fire Dance\\"), but they sound great here in their original context.  Plus, this album has a fine pop-ballad in the form of \\"Street of Dreams\\" - I don't remember it from when it came out, but I know it from the Blackmore's Night version.  All in all, this album (and this era of Rainbow in general) delivers good 80s-mainstream rock with a metal edge via Blackmore's distinctive guitar, good vocals, and good songwriting.
B002A5WQ8W|5.0|Always liked &#34;Take Five&#34;. I saw Mr.Brubeck on a PBS special and he came across as a classy gentelman. Great album.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Fun game for all! My daughter is 5 &amp; I am 33. We both love playing this together. Great app!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have a really hard time finding headphones to use for running because everything is either too big or they rub after a few miles.  These are the only thing I can tollerate over 5 miles because unlike earbuds, they dont make full contact with the inside of your ear.  It's hard to see from the picture (and hard to explain) but the piece itself that goes into your ear is not round - it's a vertical and it rests in your ear.  The tension from the headband holds them in place.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My title kinda says it all. It is pure awesome. You get to breed awesome dragons. You do not have to use a single penny unless you are impatient. So far I am a level 18 and did not use a penny. So far I have 39 gems.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Alright reading not scary but different. I liked the story telling and outcome. Needed  some tightening up .What happened to the writer
B004Y042N8|5.0|So much fun.  Absolutely fascinating. Lots of fun seeing what kind of designs we can make running finger over screen or tapping the screen.  Can't believe it's free.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|The plot was great.  The characters were great.  The story was great. What bothered me was that how Thor basically was this whiny kid in teh beginning and all of a sudden he is hyped up chosen one where everything goes his way.  Then just to spin it up, everything goes downhill and now he is arrested and the girl he is after thinks he is a sexual deviant.  A part of me hopes that if and when the second book comes out that we might see a darker side of Thor.  I don't know make him bitter on how everyone's opinion is fickle and how they loved him at one moment then readily throw him away.  The other issue I have is how they try to keep Thor's powers as some sort of secret.I mean really, he stopped a knife with his mind and all anyone would do was \\"Oh well that was interesting......let's all clap for you and then you can go back to your squire training.\\"  I mean really.....if a kid all of a sudden is stopping flying knives I would have my eyes bug out and think wow we really need to get this kid to train to use those powers for the kingdom....but no.  The other issue is how everyone seems to be very easily manipulated in this book.  Seriously, Thor's reputation is destroyed because of rumors and instead of confronting him you act like he is garbage....honestly.  And the fact it was not a coincidence that he said he has a bad feeling about it and proves you he was right you reward him by accusing him of attempted murder.....honestly. I mean, I will still read the book and the second when it comes out.....but that is my issues about the story.
B006LSZECO|2.0|i'm one of the few who didn't really like this book.  I thought it was ok and kept reading to find out what happened but really didn't enjoy this book, found it to be too much!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Very different type of book to what I normally read and it had me in its grip from the beginning to the end!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|this book was my choice for book club b/c of other reviews.  I found it very intriguing and entertaining and the photographs were spooky yet critical to the book.  I downloaded it onto my kindle on the iPad and the photos were clear (i heard some people talk about downloading grainy - but they are old photographs so not perfect in the first place.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game in the world. I can't believe that only a small amount of people know about it hoehxn jdhdifgd
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I really love this book and my 14  year old daughter loved it also. We saw the movie but the book was better!
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|This is a really, really good collection. It has all the films from the Original Series cast and the movies look great. The menus are simple to navigate, the sound is fantastic, there are commentaries on each film and there's only one thing I can complain about.<br /><br />Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. They included the theatrical cut. This cut edits out four minutes of scenes. The bulk of that deals with Peter Preston. Don't remember him? He's that cadet that Kirk picks on at the start of the film and the one Scotty brings to the bridge after the first battle with Khan. These scenes explain who he is and why Kirk and Scotty paid so much attention to him. (Still doesn't explain why he took a dying man to the bridge and not sickbay, but maybe he though Kirk was awesome enough to heal the kid through the power of charisma?) I'd suggest finding the Director's Edition of WoK as a supplement to this set, so you get the whole movie. The Director's Edition is also called the TV Cut and is director Nick Myer's preferred version of the movie.<br /><br />The Motion Picture is also the Theatrical Cut, but other cuts only serve to put ALL the effects shots from the pre-release cut back in, so I don't see the point in complaining about less padding.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book just as much as the others.  Not as dark as Sharp Objects or Dark Places, but just as twisted!

B0086700CM|5.0|I am actually on my sister's kindle fire but this game is freakin' awesome. We have it on all of our android phones, tablets, anything that you can think of! We have it on there. The graphics are absolutely amazing! This game is a great time passer. And also, I NEVER write reviews for ANYTHING but this game deserves it!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I have read this book 3 times now. Its not just about the raunchy scene's, i love the banter between them and how Ana is shy but she also stands up to him.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well done, interesting, I enjoy watching every episode. Keeps your attention, you will want to see more! Does a good job educating about what life was like in England in 1920.
B00A8SPNYW|2.0|I gave this 2 stars because of the graphics, and because the mouse is so darn cute. The game itself is VERY hard, only the first 4 -5 levels are easy enough to help you get the hang of it, then it gets pretty challenging pretty quickly. I don't enjoy games that I have to lose 7 or 8 tries before I succeed. I wish I could rate it higher.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Okay, it's your basic Spider Solitaire, you either like it or you don't. But the ease of playing a game I already liked, makes this a 5 Star...er for me. A single tap to move the cards? BRILLIANT!
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This is a great movie for the Batman fan in your life. It arrived safe and sound and made the person I got it for very happy!
B0015DROBO|4.0|It's a good book starts off slow but by the time it's gets better you can't put it down !
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Good read but haunting. Gave some insight to what it's like to suffer from this devastating disease. Highly recommend it.
B008I34YYY|5.0|Great movie, fun story, well above par special effects.  Pretty brazen shots taken at the Major Powers of the world in general and the US in particular, but all in good fun.  Finland can be forgiven for a little self righteous-ness I suppose.  :)<br /><br />Great Seller, fast delivery, product as promised.

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I liked it&hellip; me and my friend can't stop playing it. We love when we upgrade to new pets. For us it very fun so I'd give it a five star *****

1118156315|4.0|I bought this for my younger brother thinking that it was a book on writing up business plans developed from looking at your own interests. It's actually about changing career paths as an adult, but I can see how some of the self-exploration exercises might help a kid figure out what he wants to do.
B004F1F32A|5.0|Good suspenseful movie, I enjoyed it a lot. I wanted to watch Taken 2 immediately afterwards. Liam Neeson is a boss, look out for him and his skills.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great with kindle fire or your device!  great with adding subtracting and all the rest of that math.its great because I don't have a calculator. I can just pop up my kindle fire it is always charged
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Downloaded it for him and he really liked it. Itried it but didn't get to play much. I would recommed for an older child, but a calmer child would like it.
B008966SIU|4.0|I really liked this album. If you liked their last album Veckatimest you'll love this one. If is more music down the same vein. Buy it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great story line, with characters that are real. Great twists in the story as the games begin and as they move to a finish. Good ending
B004XE0P5E|5.0|FIRST OFF THE ARTWORK ON THE COVER OF THIS ALBUM IS OUTSTANDING! Bon Iver's first album was very intimate and this one picks up where For Emma... left off . Except this time hes invited a few friends. The sound is bigger and the songs are different but still Bon Iver. Just go buy it. You'll be happy with your purchase.
B0044IJ1S6|5.0|I sat front row center for this tour at Red Rocks in CO. The clarity of Blu-Ray, sound quality (5.1), and the production of this show brought back great memories of 2009!! This is a must have for any DM fan!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Good information good reference material more people should be on this diet to relieve the nations obesity diabetes and heart problems. It's such a shame to see so many people with these problems that could be eased by going on a wheat free diet. More doctors and dieticians should read this and to recommend this even as a trial to many of their patients.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I got this app just to try at first and ended up using a different one before really giving it a shot. I am so glad I eventually did. Great interface, easy to use, and I love the sound layers!
B0059XTTW8|3.0|Not near as good or as understandable as the BBC series of the same story starring Sir Alec Guinness; how sad.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Best of the three. Good story and good ending. Bane was a great villain. Even Anne Hathaway wasn't bad. 5 stats!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Fast downloading and item as described. I am pleased with my purchase. Thanks for making this order possible. Will do again in the future.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|My husband and I have read and discussed the recounting of human condition in such dire circumstances in our era.<br />We would highly recommend this biography to anyone who needs to gain understanding of the deprivation man can execute on others. We would highly recommend this work to any who are seeking understanding of the seriousness of the situation of the people of North Korea.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Fast shipping and item as described. I am pleased with my purchase. Thanks for making this order possible. Will do again in the future.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Percy Jackson meet your match! Three different heroes, three different personalities one amazing adventure. Cant wait to read the sequel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Story ljne keeps developing into a story that i dont want to come to an end.  The twist with the family fortune can keep the story line going in all kinds of direction.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|It was entertaining.  Story line Ok but you really enjoyed the acting from Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake.  It was worth the 4 bucks to watch
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Lots and lots of levels to play; very addicting.  Will be downloading the other Angry Bird game apps.  Cheap entertainment.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The quality of the blu-ray movies was awesome. Great buy. I would highly recommend it to anyone. We love Indiana Jones.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Hard to play on a Kindle Fire even with a stylus.  Graphics and sounds are very good.  I won't be trying to play much.
B001AW156U|5.0|These are super cool and give me a little advantage when I play BLOPS 2, I don't have pull on the trigger as hard anymore, but I must say this, they DO come off easily if you press hard enough, so far, they've come off countless times when I get into the heat of the moment and start smashing the buttons lol, it might be just me though.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Pretty good not a laugh riot but a sweet movie, Jones and Streep are believable and warm.  It's worth 91 minutes of your life.
B005PR44XC|4.0|Great read and a very intersting perspective of the financial issues of the last few years. Would recommend to everyone
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|not funny, save your $$ a real time waster not a good investment of time or money a very poor choice.
B00130EVSS|5.0|So many bad movies out there but have seen this one several times now. Good actors & acting, Interesting story line.
1400049628|5.0|I bought this book for my 13 year old brother as a Christmas Gift. He had the book read in one day. Even if it is the only book he reads at the time being...its a great book for someone who is really into the zombie apocolypse thing!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game helps me while I am bored. I played this game for 5 mins and I am hooked on it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I cannot get enough as any woman who reads these books of Christian Grey!! Great Read, and absolutely love these books!
B0013WI0PQ|5.0|This is a Great Movie for anyone who has a soul for music.You do &#34;HEAR&#34; it.I loved it all,except maybe the ending.<br />They definitely need to make a &#34;Sequel&#34; to this Movie. Although it is Awesome! It leave's you feeling as if there should be something More?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I cannot get enough as any woman who reads these books of Christian Grey!! Great Read, and absolutely love these books!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I can not wait to read the next one. U know it is just as good if not better.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Had to read all three. Once you start reading it is hard to put the book down. Love the element of surprise throughout the series.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|To the surprise of no one, Django Unchained is an essentially Tarantino love letter to a genre that's been left sadly underutilized over recent decades. It's every bit a straightforward action / revenge picture, with debts owed to the dozens of Leone & company spaghetti westerns that populated theaters in the sixties and seventies. The central plot is thread-bare - several of Pulp Fiction's competing storylines have quite a bit more depth - but surprisingly never really feels like it lingers or oversteps its bounds, even as the runtime approaches three hours. Eyes-forward escapism is the message of the day, and Django scratches that itch with vigor. It's a tale that, despite an egregious body count and a comical amount of gory debauchery, doesn't take itself too seriously and is inexplicably able to draw hearty laughs from moments that would have been downright chilling in another director's hands. The key role players are almost unanimously entertaining; DiCaprio as the smarmy, loathsome plantation owner, Jackson as his savvy right-hand man, Foxx as the blunt instrument of justice... they all play one note, but it's flawlessly tuned. The real show-stealer, once again, is Christoph Waltz, whose grinning, man-of-the-world bounty hunter fuels the majority of the fire. Although his role is a polar opposite to the slimy Nazi turncoat he portrayed in Inglourious Basterds, it's no less memorable and the picture sags noticeably when he isn't on the screen. Tarantino has turned in smarter efforts, carved deeper characters and written sharper dialog, but he's rarely been this indulgently entertaining. I loved the experience, especially in a theaterful of similarly-humored moviegoers, and can't wait to ingest the subtleties on my own when it's released for home viewing.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I liked this book a lot,  probably because I like good characterizations and while reading this book, I really got to know the people J.K. Rowling was writing about.  They felt like real people to me.  If you are looking for action or policemen or beautiful, rich women and handsome, rich men, this is not the book for you.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|Bond's essential 21st century reboot is expertly orchestrated and potently thrilling, although I wonder if it may have pressed itself a bit too far in an effort to feel contemporary. The parkour and hold'em scenes in particular already feel out-of-touch, with both fads freshly occupying the rear-view mirror, but that's hardly a fresh hurdle for the series to clear. Daniel Craig makes for a far better Bond than I'd hoped, especially during the nail-biting action scenes or the prerequisite mingling with the high-cultured elite. He isn't the quip-slinging lady killer that Connery or Brosnan were, at least not yet, but he's twice as convincing when the time comes to flex a little muscle (or leap from one precariously-perched construction crane to another, as it were). This isn't a perfect effort - the poker climax is recklessly telegraphed, and the final forty minutes feel like a weepy, long-winded epilogue - but it is an action joyride, stuffed with clever winks and nods at the character's past, and one of the best Bonds ever made.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I chose this item because I enjoy playing Bingo it is relaxing for me.  I dislike the fact I run out of credits but I know this is the way the game goes so I have to live with it.  I would recommend this game to anyone that loves Bingo.
B002MJV75O|5.0|I am thinking of buying the series but have been hearing that certain dvd releases of the show have a washed out look and aren't as high quality as others and also I have been hearing the packaging in some are not satisfactory. If anyone can point me in the right direction of the best set to buy it would be great.﻿ Thanks!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I laughed so hard.  I thought it was wonderful.  I can't wait for my grandson to get older so we can watch together.
B000007VLL|2.0|Song selection is great but the sound on many tracks is very disappointing. What source did they use? I've heard all these songs elsewhere and they sounded great! For example,the track \\"It's A Heartache\\". I have the same track on an old Rhino Records collection that I purchased years ago and it has the full fidelity sound. The version here, along with my other favorite tracks, (Holding out..., Faster than...,and Total Eclipse) sound lifeless. Shame on Columbia Records for manufacturing such inferior product. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it. This cd is going to my local Goodwill store
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This was strange to say the least and Pepper SCARED the heck out of me. I do like how some of the original cast was written into this season and how great Mrs. Lange acts in theism season. She is a much stronger woman with serious convictions. I do like both seasons very much but season was 1 was a but predictable where season 2 kept me guessing and a little freaked out
0345803493|2.0|I purchased this book as I was interested in the 50SOG trilogy. The book was okay, but it wasn't great writing. The first book was the best of the three, but the writing, at times made me laugh. While the sex scenes were steamy, I found them to be raunchy for raunchy's sake after a while.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun little app.  Pretty in depth for a free app.  Similar style to farrmville on facebook. Takes no time to get use to.
0345803485|3.0|I liked this one. It was a good start of the trilogy, however, downhill after this book. The whole prospect of Christian and Ana hooked me, but the writing was still mediocre.
1400067820|4.0|Mr. Taleb is not easy to read, his prose leans toward the dense.  Sometimes I had to reread some of the passages to make sure I understood what he was saying.<br />It is well worth the effort.  His perception and point of view are worthwhile and always interesting.
0345803507|2.0|I jumped on the phenomenon which was 50SOG. I can surmise a few things: Christian Grey is a misogynist and doesn't like women too much. Ana is a fool who has daddy issues. After a while, the sex scenes were predictable.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I think that I can't find a flaw in this game. Oh wait there is one. NO ZOMBIES YET XD
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Coldplay did it again. This is a great hit. Love the music and vocals. It was great to hear the strings and the majestic music. The vocals are icing on the cake.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|IT held my intrest and was an easy read. Can't wait to read the next one.You might want to try it yourself.
0743201140|3.0|Good book. Would have rated this higher if the code in the back of the book would have worked. I wasn't happy after spending the money to test out. Amazon was no help in getting the code.
B008VBYN80|3.0|well this is pretty fun if you don't have anything better to do and u wanna kill some time. on the down side it wants you to pay for all the good stuff. for that reason id pass
B002N44XSG|5.0|The book was awesome and had stories that no-one would dream of. I loved the capture the flag story with Annenberg,Percy,beckoning and selena
1449433251|5.0|It was a gift and the recipient couldn't have been happier. It's very heavy and I should have sent it directly but I'll know for next time.
B001L5VYFI|5.0|This has been one of may favorites, since I was a teenager. I had the album CD and now the mp3. A true classic rock album.
B0063GORYU|5.0|easy to play mobile version of Spider solitaire. The movement of the cards is fun once you get the hang of it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I don't like hackers please help. or I'm deleting this game. I love rpg games. I wish I can fond this nes game that I played on the Pc I think. its breath of fire but you get to level up dragons :)
B00138KCU6|5.0|As a fan of Springsteen for over 35 years, this ranks up near the top of the list! It would be one of his top 4  albums, Born to Run, Born in the USA, Darkness on the Edge of Town and The Rising!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awessome game great things to do. always fun. leaves you wanting to play more but you are still able to put it down.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly has written a story with such great character development that you feel like you know the characters.  Harry Bosch and I have been friends for years. Harry's determination and outstanding detective skills catch the bad guys,but his good heart makes reading entertaining. The Black Box is another success go Mr, Connelly.  Recommended to all mystery/detective lovers.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I think its a great app for any child or adult that is bored with nothing to do. This is a must get app! :D
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|it is fun but I don't like that when u go to get an animal and u runout of gas then u have tobuy with peanuts. peanuts are expensive with actually money!
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|The reason why I gave the product five stars is the following: I love Green Day, this is a Green Day product, therefore I love it. Yes, it did meet my expectations, in fact, it surpassed my expectations, so I'm happy. I still don't understand why I have to tell you why I'm happy but....whatever. Hope I could help.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|love this app but it gets a little to hard as you get higher in the game .the only way to win is to buy money.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I liked the character development of the people Cheryl met on the trail but Cheryl herself drove me nuts. Maybe it's because I'm a Girl Scout married to a Boy Scout and we are always prepared. I wish she also would have written an epilogue to tell us how she met and married her new husband. I still was attached to her first one by the time the book ended. Sigh.
1451695195|3.0|A rather scholarly attempt at writing to a non-scientific type audience.<br />However, it was certainly a unique experience that should be read by those who are fascinated by the subject matter.<br />It does bring scientific credence to the afterlife, but needs a stronger editorial hand!<br />I couldn't put it down.
B00164GDD2|1.0|I wait 3 weeks for a copy of Ghostbusters blu-ray and i get a cheap, chewed, torn up library copy of the movie. I was very disappointied because i love this movie a lot and my expectations were just shattered.
034580404X|5.0|wife has not put the book down, has enjoyed the entire trilogy and is about to reread the entire collection. seller was speedy and provided great customer service.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|PROOF OF HEAVEN<br />Excellent account of his &#34;out  of body&#34; experience.  Well written and well worth reading, particularly for Christians.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Streep was great as usual and Jones was sour as usual.  I'm glad I rented it rather than go to the theater to see it.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Very sturdy case. I love the color choices and the price was awesome. Easy to hang onto when reading in bed at night.  Not at all bulky and fits nicely in my purse.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I can't stop reading it, a good way to get ready for the movie.  Although it probably won't be as good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoyed this game travel and it kept myself entertained. It was worth the download for sure. I haven't had any problems with the game plus I can connect to Facebook and share my progress with my friends.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|i love this movie<br />i think everyone needs to watch this and learn from forrest gump<br />This movie will make you cry and laugh, it will make you think more about what to do with your life and the message is beautifu;.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This has got to be one of the beat series I have ever seen.  If a zombie  ever came to my door I would know exactly how to get rid of it...great training video..ha!
B0014EU5XI|5.0|Some of the dance mixes I could do without, but the other 90% of this album is pure gold: A big bag of remastered hits from one of the greatest bands of all time.<br /><br />If you're a ZZ Top fan, you simply must buy this album and if you're not... well... what's wrong with you?  It's ZZ Top we're talking about here.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Great movie.  Plenty of action with a good story line.  Not to hard to understand the tie-in to previous Bourne movies.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I had this app on my wish list for purchase and had not purchased it and today found it was a free app! I followed the download instructions for my home desktop...downloaded the app from their website and entered the appropiate information. I did find out that you do need a Google account to download this app to your Kindle Fire HD. At the website they allow you to create an acct...and before you know it you've got your desktop on your Kindle! It is shown as real time on your Kindle...I did fiddle around with it awhile and looking forward to using it at a later time.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I got the game from a football game who would think it would be the best game ever it about saving animal's
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Great stunts though,didn't see the connection develop between the main characters...disappointing.  Great bike stunts though.  No more chase scenes please, they have been done to death and are boring...
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Graphics are great, game play is challenging without being too difficult. Would recommend.<br /> Hope you enjoy playing it as much as I did.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This works as stated. Also purchased the ear buds that were advertised with this item.  Both work wonderfully. Use them just for walking exercise so have not had any problems with battery.
0446343129|2.0|While the message has much validity, the author's presentation is so biased that it is very hard to finish reading the very short book
B000W93CHC|4.0|Good story and characters.  Lots of suspense.  It is definitely one of those books you don't want to put down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it it is the best game ever. it is great for children 7 and up. I think it is interesting it is like takeing care of a real horse
B000VZYPB4|5.0|This is real life these days where the smart people are becoming common culture and it can only be good for our society. No one is as bad as sheldon though, no one.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|This is a very funny flick. Just couldn't believe how funny it is. It's also cute. Me and my grand kids will be watching this for a long time to come.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love Pac-Man, I always have and when I saw it available, thought I would try it.<br />I would recommend this to anyone with kids
B005LAII80|5.0|From seeing the previews, I wasn't sure about this. And didn't go see it in the theater. But once I got the blu-ray. I was shocked. It is better then the original. I love it. I've watched it numerous times now.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As always, a very entertaining read. Lee child is one of my favorite authors and this teacher novel did not disappoint.
B004FPE4DK|5.0|I LOVED THIS C.D!! GREAT PACKAGING!!  5 STARS!!! THE ITEM I PURCHASED ARRIVED ON TIME!! IT WAS A GREAT PURCHASE
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a really fun game. if you love to to take care of horses, this is the game for you.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Downton Abbey Seasons 1&2. Loved watching the story unfold and caught up on season two so I could follow Season 3!
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I have been playing for 2 weeks had all but one expansion, had 20+ animal families AND spent REAL MONEY on peanuts.  the game updated lat night AND I LOST IT ALL!!!!!! I am DONE!!!!!!!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|To be honest the only way anyone can get through this game is if you are an adult who has actual money to spend. Quests require gems and many ponies are required to proceed. This game CANNOT be played without buying gems or you will end up spending literal months saving up to proceed to the next section.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A GAME FOR KIDS.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an awesome book!!!!!!<br />Very well written and the story line is just great!<br />It's also very heart-wrenching!!<br />Colleen knows how to make you smile, laugh out loud, and cry.  Most of all, she can make you feel the heartache and joy the characters are feeling!!!
B004LROUW2|4.0|First book I read by this author.  I was impressed.  Characters were original.  Plot was intriguing.  Ending was weak though.  Felt like author just ran out of steam and got tired of his own story.  The story was like following a dream sequence.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|This music is wonderfully similar to days of the past, yet totally new.  New memories will be made, but this just makes the original stuff also enjoyable today
B001EC3JME|5.0|Very Sturdy...Well Made....Versatile! The Clip Is Also Designed In A Way To Stay Put, And You Do Not Have To Worry About Losing Your Light Or The Holder.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Wow this was great read. I would recommend this for any age.  I must get the kids to read the series
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Set in the Boston area, this story felt like it could really have happened.  Very contemporary and relevant to our times.
0887307280|5.0|If you own a small business or are thinking about starting one. This book will give you insight that will help you beat the odds of being one of the unlucky ones that had a dream but did not know how to make it work.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I have loved Ivan Vorpatril since the Warrior's Apprentice...and I'm SO glad he finally got a novel length story of his own.  He definitely deserved one!  I have been reading the Vorkosigan Saga since the beginning, and I have always loved Miles, but Ivan is irresistable in his own right.  I won't say this is the best Vorkosigan/Barrayaran book ever, but it is very very good.  I hope Ivan will be getting another chance to star, or at least co-star, soon please.  If you love LMB's books...read this, if you only love Miles...don't bother.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a good game. very adicting. the only downfall is that it is hard to get coins and gems.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|interesting concept for a movie on time travel. The farm house was built very well to last over 125 years...
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This show is just so great! They must have a team researching fairy tales to work in. They really come up with some really inventive ways to weave all the stories together. The way that they shift back and forth between the current time in Storybrooke to the past in the kingdoms is really neat too. A must watch!
B00361R2VU|2.0|Wasn't such a fan - I guess it was just not for me.  BUT - no download jitters or stalls - very happy with movies steamed from amazon.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was good!!  I totally didn't expect the twist but it was good and I would definitely recommend it! :)
B000HAB4KS|4.0|i gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because, well, Keanu Reeves. But despite his predictably and consistantly horrible acting, it is a true modern sci-fi classic
0307200477|5.0|Lovely edition. Perfect for every new member of a family. Bound to be a sturdy family tradition. Worth the additional price
B00005N6KG|5.0|these are awesome. lightweight, don't hurt my ears (like the headphones you squish inside your ear, or drape over your ear), and doesn't hurt my head like a headband does.
B00005JN0T|5.0|It arrived on time, so it came when I was expecting it. It played just like new even though I bought it used. Great deal!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the second book also. Even though it was not as good as the first one I would tell my family and friends to read it.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Great deal! It arrived faster than expected and played wonderfully! I absolutely Loved it!. . . . . . .
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is awesome - addicting but awesome - my kids (7 and 10) love it as well as mommy and daddy.  We have 5 devices (samsung smart phone, motorola xoom,samsung mp3, trio tablet and zeke tablet - all have this game on it ! cause we love it !)
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I bought this movie used, yet it played like brand new! Great deal! It also showed up early, so I got it faster than expected, which was fantastic!
B008OOYALE|5.0|fun game.  my 9 year old really likes it too.  we play together.  really hard to level up though.  farming takes all my gold but you have to farm to level up.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|GREAT BOOK! Keeps you on your toes and makes you feel as though you are right there in the story with the characters right next to you. Sad I've read through the whole book already. Definitely recommend!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|this case is worth every penny. Does not add hardly any weight and it is very useful. So far it appears to be much sturdier that other cases I have had for my Kindles.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is tells you virtually everything you should ever need to know about the weather in your city or town. To my knowledge it has been completely accurate and it is easy to read! I'll never go back to &quot;the weather channel&quot; app! Totally the best weather app available!
B0000E1WKE|2.0|You must like ethnic southern church sound to like this-not Whitney singing Christmas songs in a traditional style. Also, some tracks sounded muffled-like a recording of a cd from this particular source.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game soooo much, don't get me wrong. But it refuses to do whatever it is that I did that should accompany the specific reaction from the character(s). 4 1/2 stars, if it was possible. But this game is addictive and tons of fun!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Loved this movie, it was a very charming look at young love, and I would certainly recommend this movie to all my friends
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Standard good guy/ bad guy, over-the-top violence and blood.  The characters were so one dimensional that if they'd turned sideways they would have disappeared.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|so helpful keeping me organized. Would recommend to anyone. I like the multiple calender options. I have not missed an appointment since buying it.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|This was such a fun game that I felt obligated to write a review. This game is so refreshing and creative!! It runs flawlessly on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and I never experienced any glitch problems. I love how the game keeps building on what you create and it never gets mundane. I am definitely looking forward to buying all other available games from Kairosoft. It's so worth the price!!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I'm always playing this game! Perfect for any age. It's challenging, I love challenging games.  I say get the game!!!!
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Have used this with a GoPro Hero HD camera in aircraft by tucking the mic inside the pilot's headset earcup to capture communications.  Amazing how well it has done in high noise environments and the fine quality it has recorded.  The big downside is not knowing that the battery is &#34;on&#34; and if the battery still has sufficient power.  The unit will not work unless the battery switch is on; I verified this with a test.  Great value; keep fresh batteries on hand.
B00AOOIIVA|5.0|My family loved this it was awesome!! The flying cat was really funny<br />I would recommend this movie too all my friends
B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed this trilogy more than I expected. I am typically not one to get caught up in a romance novel, especially one that involves BDSM, but I found myself wanting more with every page. I wanted to know what was to become of the innocent Anastasia and the oh so angry Christian!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My son and I love it! Lots of fun, recommend this game the whole family will love it, my son is seven always wants to play, it's hard trying to get my kindle back so I can use it.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie had me laughing until my stomach hurt and tears were rolling down my checks,  the best laugh yet.
B004C00EM8|5.0|If you have never seen this movie, but have heard about and are ok with the content, run, don't walk and watch it.  The first half is a tad slow and predictable, but the conclusion is absolutely stellar.  It is a difficult watch, but so worth it.  Check what you think you know about faith at the door.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|loved the game very addictive my friend went home after watching me play to buy the game cant wait till the sequel
B004W4N55C|1.0|This app crashes anytime I try to get more detail on a tab. Without this working, it's really a non functional app. it sounds like other people were having similar problems on ice cream sandwich so maybe a similar issue on jelly bean.
B00870ZH3U|5.0|Great movie if you love Phantom of the Opera, I like that it is very different, but follows the story line. I was confused that they had a child together-spoiler alert!-but it was a great way to take the story.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun game for my grandchildren, and I enjoy playing it myself. My gradchildren range from 12 to 20 years old and all like the game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book has a great story.  It is written in a way that keeps your interest with everchanging without being wordy.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I can't believe how they try to scan you on spending money on a free game, up to a hundred bucks....this game is addicting yes but I will not spend a dime on fake money and second acorns. I hate this game but I love it....for explain its cool to build your own land but each time you buy land it goes up 100,000, 2000,000, 3000,000 until you get to a million then boom straight to ten million after the mil!!!!! Wtf? And it does glitches out here and there but not a lot and all you have to do is pres that black tab to the right and press the house to get out
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Great characters and beautifully done!  The whole family enjoyed it and we will buy it used when the price comes down a little.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|My niece just love it. Thanks! We got it in perfect conditions and in time.<br />Certainly I will buy some more music in the near future.<br />Thank you!
B005OCFGTO|4.0|The dvds were great for the price and the movies are awesome!  Anyone with children over 10 years of age or anyone who loves a great cast and well made movies with magic should at least own this set.  The packaging, however, was not the best.  The first one came with the spine broken inside so the leaves would slide all over and fall out.  It was replaced immediately with no wait so we were delighted with the service!
B000063Y8F|5.0|I purchased this for a gift because I already have one. It is by far the best garlic press I have ever used and is super easy to clean.
0743243153|4.0|A patient of mine recommended this author to me.  I believe that somehow, God brings you answers through people and other forms of delivery.  I found within this book many answers to many questions.  Questions of why I am the way I am.  Where my fears, insecurities, and in some cases securities and confidence come from.  I learned how childhood can make or break an individual.  Most importantly, I learned that even though a person may have a hard childhood, he/she can and is very well capable of living a harmonies life.  A life filled with love, serenity, joy, self confidence, and security.  I learned to trust my intuition, to have self worth and most importantly to trust in God.  To know that all things are possible with God.  I learned that God is different for us all.  To me God is Peace.  May you find the answers that you are looking for in this book also.
B009C7JS14|5.0|It's very cool! This app looks nice and has so many cities from different countries! I liked it very much.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Pretty good series. I feel a movie series coming. If so I'll probably go see all of them. You won't be disappointed with the book's.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|I don't want to give away anything and I won't.<br /><br />I hate when people don't warn you first and then offer a  movie SPOILER.<br /><br /> I will say that ,I usually cry over animal movies- war movies- anything that has some powerful  theme or message to it.<br /><br />I never cry over romance  movies for the most part.  Something pretty profound has to happen or be said to move me.<br /><br />For some reason though, this movie in all its simplicity- got to me.<br /><br />In the dark, in my den, watching this with my sister, my face had tears- ranging from happy to sad tears and back again.<br /><br />This movie for me, was heart stirring right from the beginning.<br /><br />Seeing Nicolas Cage's face, so wide with innocence and wonder, versus Meg Ryan's tired appearance and jaded outlook on life, was a good contrast.<br /><br />The operating room scene(very early in the movie) sets the stage for the storyline and explains the immediate connection Cage begins to feel toward Ryan, a heart surgeon.<br /><br />Most of the emotions conveyed in this movie are done with looks between each of them.<br /><br />The dialog does not carry the entire story.<br /><br />There is a German version of this movie, I believe, and it also has a sequel to it.<br /><br />You would have to go to Wikipedia to get the name of it.<br />Problem is- when you look anything up online, regarding a movie, you have to worry you will see a spoiler.<br /><br />I just may see the German version and if it is as good as it has been touted, I probably will see the sequel as well.<br /><br />But I know already, not to compare it to the USA's CITY OF ANGELS.
B007NESBK2|4.0|Was a great concert! Sound and quality are great. Enjoyed the scenes at the end as well. Will watch over and over.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|Loved the movie.  Best movie ever.  I would recommend it to everyone. It was really really really great.  Thanks so much.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|The only problem is that there are too few episodes....because they didn't make anymore. Other than that the disk has all that were made.
B001C46P2K|5.0|this is a great movie.  my wife and i both really enjoyed it.  it's a fantastic relief from the &#34;naughty royals&#34; that are so often portrayed on film.
B008602KQI|5.0|Didn't think I would like it, I actually loved it.....better than I expected. Excellent reception via the internet and now I own it for my Kindle
B001AQO3QA|5.0|how can you not love alien.  this is a great collection.  all the films look fantastic.  nice menus and special features.  the only thing i dislike is the &#34;book&#34; style case.  i prefer the plastic snap in blu-ray cases.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Didn't pay attention to it at first but it keeps me busy now! I strongly recommend it to puzzle lovers. This one is a keeper!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I couldn't put this book down but was a bit disappointed in the ending. Usually King leaves room for your imagination at the end.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  It's a very well written post apocalyptic story with an interesting look into social stratification.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I have not seen the movie, but this book encourages me to do so. I love the use of words and language.
B000RVK1AQ|4.0|Nicklas Cage is a diverse actor.  Good action and story line. God always will win, the devil will always lose.
1476712042|4.0|i am excited for the next book. it makes me wonder what will happen next. i was really into this book. i feel like i was really betrayed when travis brought home a girl after he and abby broke up. this book moved me and made me feel like i was part of it. salute to the author. she knows how to touch her readers!! wonderful!!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Good prevailed.  Tonny Lee and Will are a good match as actors.  Sometimes the aliens are a little far fetched, but adds humor.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Wonderfully written and such an interesting/unique concept.  I absolutely loved it and felt very attached to the characters!  Must read!
B004M8AL6E|5.0|Robert Duval is soooo good he earns the five stars. I like the whole story, which is both tender-hearted and very violent. Violence was endemic, but in this story the Indians are almost always the bad guys, unfortunately. This is quite faithful to the book.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Beautifully written, fascinating story. Surreal and metaphorical, interesting and very colourful. I was truly able to relate to the main character: he is portrayed as such an ordinary person, but achieves something so magnificently unusual.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy was a great read and I couldn't of have imagined if I had ordered it one book at a time, you have to pick up the next book immediately, it was that good.
B002361MLA|5.0|Very well written, informative. Clear and concise answers to som deep questions. Resonated very strobgly with me. It took a while to read, as it is very dense with insight and thought provoking content.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Fun game, good time waster. I see don't like how it harasses you to register on Twitter & Facebook. Very annoying.<br /><br />UPDATE: After playing a little longer, it forces you to run out of diamonds and the only way to keep playing is to purchase more. Absolutely ridiculous. Fun while it lasted, but I deleted it.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|Whimsical story, reads like poetry! This book really makes you believe in magic and the timeless power of love and faith. I loved every page!
B0035JRVR8|5.0|I enjoyed the quaint chastity depicted in the bygone era of the film.  It reminded me that sometimes anticipation and restraint can be equally - if not more - sensual than today's instant and unrestrained indulgences.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a most intriguing first of three. I couldn't wait to begin reading the second one.  So I didn't. I bought the second one straightaway!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow is my first thought. I know people in marriage are at times in love and in hate. But this story shows how demented that bond can be. There are so many really mentally screwed up relationships that it makes me wonder why we even try. Is that how evil we all are? If so what is the reason for our existence?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Omg I live peeta. To me he is the one that really kept the story going. Katniss should have done more than just hide and heal.
B00A757EFW|4.0|i got it for my grandson to play and he 5 yrs old and he had fun with playing it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was the best - suspense, romance and action all rolled into one! My teenage daughter loved it and so did I! :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|a series with a great story, a great cast, and dignity.  I've never enjoyed a series more!!  And to think I used to think that British was dull and boring - boy did I get it wrong!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it's a fun game though I hate having to wait to do some of the games.... over all its a fun game!
B0063IH60K|4.0|The cards in play are touching each other and they and their designations are somewhat difficult to read without super eyesight.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book although sad was also a book that makes one wonder what you would do for love.  I wonder.
0446581356|3.0|I'm a make-up novice and the book was a great starting point for me.  With that said, it did leave me wanting to learn a lot more.  There were not many different eye options and I'd really like to learn dozens of eye techniques step-by-step.  So nice starter, but if you already know the basics, consider skipping this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. I go on it every day. No complaints. This app is easy to play on.You should get it.
B005LAII62|5.0|This was a fun dark treat in animation.  The story and effects are a bit morbid and might be too extreme for anyone under seven years old.  If someone has a problem with dark stuff or Halloween, then you may want to steer clear of this.  The movie follows the story of a young boy named Norman who has Medium capabilities.  He basically sees and talks to the dead the way the young boy in the \\"Sixth Sense\\" did.  He is considered weird by his family and peers and more or less is an outcast.  What's great about this is the ugly doesn't come from the boy, the zombies or the dead, it comes from humanity in general.  This was a super enjoyable movie with stunning animation and scenery as well as a message about getting to know someone instead of passing judgement.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|The pirate monkey was fun....um. That's about it. Other than that it was a complete snorefest. The jokes are really stale and it's getting harder and harder to give a hoot about the damn main characters and the fact that the wife and daughter mammoth keep getting into trouble...yawn.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a great book, I was inspired to read the book due to the TV Series, captivating and descriptive.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|When I first saw the trailers for this movie, I was like &#34;pffft, yeah, that looks awful.&#34; The trailer reeked of desperation, using a few amazing shots to sell you the action, only to betray itself by giving away the hidden ugliness which was low budget and limited sets and environments. Some of us pay attention by god! Then I saw that it was offered in 3D, which just seemed like tying a pretty red bow around a pile of steaming...well, you get the idea.<br /><br />But then I saw that it was getting good reviews and I was all like...HUH?. This was, needless to say, a wee bit intriguing, as well as humbling, because my trailer analysis formula is rarely wrong. But i never got to the theater...I missed it.<br /><br />But, I saw it on Amazon and was elated! I punched in my pin code and let the sci-fi ultra violence flow from the screen and into my brain. It is a film that isn't breaking any new ground, but the story was great and Carl Urban delivers as usual. It was the first time a comic adaptation felt like exactly like the comic that inspired it. I felt like I was watching a gritty Judge Dredd comic come to life. The sets are limited, but that's because the film makers decided to be smart about the obviously modest budget they had to work with. It's set inside a giant building in Megacity one, sort of like Die Hard, only darker and waaaay bloodier. I mean, holy eff the gore in this. heads exploding, slow mo bullets penetrating fat bellies. It was awesome.<br /><br />All said and done, solid flick that is definitely re-watchable.
B0076DELIG|4.0|A good read. A plot that keeps you guessing. The investigative detail, logic and step by step process is very satisfying.A good ending.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I would recommend this movie to older couples looking toput a spark in their marriage. It was fun to watch on a cold afternoon.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|free third persion hack n slash what more could one ask for. maby the current 2.1.0 dragon hunter update. and also a way to transfer are profiles from one device to another
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just like playing at CEC except it goes faster and I do not have to leave home to play it.
B007ZMHBBM|4.0|Great classic blues jam. Great memories! Exlent video & audio. Were really that young & funky? Great job on tweekin the original vid!
0810996596|5.0|This book is awesome! Any classic horror movie lovers need to add this to their collection. Makes a great coffee-table book
B0086700CM|5.0|i would consider temple run a fun game it freezes sometimes but overall fun and exciting!! should have more ways to earn points though
B001ILFUD2|5.0|The movie was in excellent condition and I received it before Christmas so I am very pleased.  I purchased this for my 4 month old grandson and he just loves the songs
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a super fun game, but why waste 7.00 when you could get it free? download it online. Get to tutorials on youtube on how to download minecraft online on you're kindle fire HD or Kindle Fire. thx, Ps: I got it free! LUV THIS GAME!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|excellent condition.  I received it before Christmas.  I am very pleased.  My 4 month old grandson loves to watch the part where they sing Hakuna Matata
B003M70O5O|5.0|Downloaded seasons 1 & 2. Love the series, so had to have it. Excellent quality. Would highly recommend. Well worth it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|u need to get this app right now its the best app in the world nothing Is wrong with this app
B000002H33|5.0|Master of puppets is my all time favorite metallica song ever! And sanitorium so this is a great album well worth the money!
B002POMHVE|5.0|Love this album!! Can't get enough. The songs get stuck inside your head. And that is a good thing. It's just Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nothing special but it gets the job done. All I need in a calculator. That is all I have to say...
098555780X|1.0|The book is really not for making real, useful para cord bracelets, just wannabe types using multiple short lengths. Makes nice girly bracelets. Not one page was useful. Anyone want to by a used book cheap?
B005HSL626|5.0|I love how this looks on my kindle fire 8.9 inch. Its a fun and addicting game. I use it to pass a slow Night shift whenever my patient is sleeping.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|I am a great fan of the Jason Bourne trilogy and just had to get this one.  It took me two attempts at watching it through to grasp the storyline and get used to another actor.  This was done well as it introduced the original main characters from the Bourne series and somewhat explained the theory behind the story through flashbacks.  I can see this going on as a new series, and Jeremy Renner was excellent.  This would be a good movie to buy so you can watch it repeatedly.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it still isn't as great as the original Bourne trilogy, but it's pretty close.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Graphics are great on the Kindle Fire HD. One of the better free games available and if you like a good puzzle game to keep you occupied - this is it. It also has a number of levels for great variety.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great book but I wanted more! It was kind of predictable, more drama would have made it a more interesting read.
0425252868|5.0|Excellent book with incredible meaning!  I loved it and have recommended it to many of my friends and co-workers at the VA Hospital
B007V2UGPE|4.0|fun game.  can spend lots of hours working on the best way to play.  hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
B005HPY8LU|5.0|Was given as a gift and the recipient LOVES all the music on the cd.  Was glad she received it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.<br />She'd had it on her phone for 3 weeks when she dropped it from about waist high and the corner broke off.<br />We called the LifeProof company, they asked for the serial number from the box.<br />When we gave it to them they told us it was a fake and there was nothing they could do to replace it for us.<br />My daughter was very upset and now we're out $30 and will have to spend even more to replace it with the real deal.<br /><br />STAY AWAY!!
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Nikki Sixx didn't hold back.  I love that his diaries were fleshed out with commentary from the people he speaks of.  The supplemental notes make this book a must read.  All of the players, by way of their participation in the book, verify the truth and accuracy of Nikki's account.  Vanity aka Denise Matthews is also prominent in this book. Probably the most info you will find about her previous life is in this book. This was definitely a good read.
B001OHWDWG|1.0|Do NOT buy this collection.  While the song selection is very good I want to know why Motown could not and did not issue this collection in stereo when a great portion of these songs are available in stereo on other albums.  This is a cheap ploy by Motown to suck in your money.  The second Hitsville Box 2 is in stereo, but the song selection is poor.  I repeat, if you want a quality box set collection that is well engineered and in stereo, do NOT include this one.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|The first book introduces us to Mma Ramotswe.  She has a loving family and safe childhood, growing up to become an independent woman.  I have often wondered about Africa, the motherland for all of us. This book provided some insight into its' culture, policies, and values of Africa. Mma Ramotswe was lucky to find home where she lives.  Her choice of profession surprises many, but she does succeed. It was surprising to see Mma Ramostwe change her values to do the right thing (in her opinion), and convince others to follow her direction. My favorite story (case) is the teenager, who succeeds in misdirecting both her family and Mma Ramotswe. My saddest story, is her first love and its tragic outcome. I alway believed that having a good father, would protect us from choosing the wrong man. Mma Ramotswe followed her heart instead the of the opinions of family. Love finds Mma Ramotswe again, but it is unclear if her heart or her head is directing the choice. I look forward to book 2 to see if she got it right this time.
B002RVCD0U|3.0|After just watching the movie, it would have been better if it had less action and more mystery. It also should have been more character driven with Worthington and more subtle- Movie was much better than what the main stream movie critics give it credit for. Again its far better than T2 but not as good as T2.
B0084AYLK8|5.0|I couldn't put this novel down until I finished it.  The characters are fascinating and their interwoven lives and fates are believable.
0425252868|5.0|To be fair I was hooked by the story as soon as I heard Adam's interview on Diane Rehm, and I certainly wasn't disappointed by the book. The events on that December morning 70 years ago are just as unbelievable as is the fact that both Franz and Charlie survived the war not to mention were able to find each other. Doubtlessly to the American reader Franz's story is much more foreign if not intriguing than Charlie's but their brief interaction is what truly shed light on both men's character's.<br /><br />A great read and well worth the money.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|The app is fully compatible and runs smoothly on Samsung 55\\" D6530 Series 6 SMART 3D Full HD LED TV. The pre-loaded videos (TED for example) are with very high quality and it is a pleasure to watch them. I am very happy with it!
B00914JWSW|1.0|Sadly, this is one of Barbra's worst albums ever!  I can see why these selections were not included in previous albums.  It sounds like Ms. Streisand is trying to prove her vocal superiority but there is no beauty in the lyrics or music.  Except for How are Things in Glocca Morra/Heather on the Hill medley, the melodies are totally lost in the constant attack on the notes which flutter and fly wildly without purpose.  The overall message is one of sadness and loss which quickly gets depressing.  Unlike the old torch songs that can be melancholy but still rousing, these tunes, if one can call them that, are forgettable.  I still haven't made it through all the tracks on the album.  Gosh, Babs, what were you thinking?<br /><br />UPDATE:  I got through to the end of the album and I think I'll be donating this to Goodwill.  Goodness gracious, what a dud!
B0046B4VXQ|3.0|It's good enough to watch at least once...I had to watch the film for my psychology of adolescence class but if I had to watch again on my own, I probably would pass.  However, I am interested in watching the remake.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Allie Condie did a very good job with writing the second novel in her series. The characters feel alive and are well thought. The plot line is exciting and creative... cant wait to read the next one!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|So good! Bravo<br />I recommend this book to all dog lovers, parents, and persons who are out to win this race of life.
030746363X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  As someone who is likes science-based research it was detailed enough to get the point across.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Amazing actors great storyline and who doesn't love a little fantasy! It is very different which gives a good break to the scyfy vampires and werewolf shows (which I love too).
1439127700|5.0|These relationships are intriguing.  They never told us this good stuff in History Class. I didn't want to see it end.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Fun game but annoyed that it's not really free like it says.  It's really a free demo that you can play through to a certain point and then you have to pay to unlock the rest.  Would have been nice to know up front.
0439023513|5.0|This was a great novel.  More political than the previous two books.  Parents...please make sure you are previewing what your kids are reading.  As a teacher, I see young children reading this book and wonder if this got okay'ed by mom & dad.  These books are very violent.
B009MFKO3M|5.0|Incredible follow-up to Innerspeaker. Beautiful songs. Do yourself a favor and buy it, listen to it on repeat. I got this before a recent long car trip and it made the ride so much more enjoyable. If you like fuzzy psychedelic guitar rock, you'll like this album.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Excellent reading.Can't wait for the next book. Such detail such imagination makes you feel as if you are there. highly recommend
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is the best.  The hardest part is trying to figure what side to go to when those apes are coming after you.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is a lot of fun but I also had trouble trying to download it. I had to download three times just to get it to work.
B003UBTX72|4.0|Interesting. More of a family oriented guy than I would have thought. Keith seems like a fun loving, mischievous guy. The world he lives in is not real for most of us, so the insight is revealing. If your a Stones fan, its entertaining. Written with honesty and humility such as it is.
0345350472|4.0|i was required to read this book for class and it turned out to be very interesting and fascinating. I never saw the movie though
B008QZ1ZYQ|3.0|I bought this for my Kindle Fire, but I've recently removed it because it kept freezing up and I had to reset alot. It just got aggravating after the 5th time.
0765325950|4.0|In A Memory of Light, Mr. Sanderson concludes the previously seemingly unending saga of the Wheel of Time that the late Robert Jordan began.  The most important thing about the book is that it is an actual ending instead of an announcement that the actual finale will take place over another trilogy to be completed ten years from now.<br /><br />Why to buy this book: I've said it before and I'll say it again -- if you're reading a review of a sequel, the main thing you want to know is if the author completely screwed it up.  He didn't.  It was a solid read, engaging at times.  Some of the scenes were even awesome.  One in particular involving Rand, Mat, and Tuon was incredibly well done.  Mat shined in this book.<br /><br />Why not to buy the book: It's hard to evaluate this book on its own.  I didn't go back and reread the entire series leading up to it (my wife probably would have threatened divorce if I would have), and I might have felt differently if I had.  It seemed extremely choppy as Mr. Sanderson jumped to a new character and situation seemingly with every scene.  I'm not sure that he could have avoided this technique too much since there were so many threads to tie up, but it sure made it hard to get into the book.  I found the first half incredibly easy to put down.  There were also some technical issues that stood out to me like the overuse of \\"then\\" and speech tags, but these were minor.  The biggest problem was that Mr. Sanderson completely failed to make me feel anything when major characters died.  I would have expected to feel a least a little sad; instead, nothing.<br /><br />Bottom Line: It was worth the read, and Wheel of Time remains my favorite fantasy series.  I give WoT 5 stars but can only manage 4 for this book individually.
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|This is the only full movie that I've purchased to download on my Kindle Fire so far. Sometimes we just need a real movie for the kids to watch in case we can't get wifi somewhere and Toy Story 3 is a good one to have. All of the Toy Story movies are great. Barbie and Ken together are just so cute. It's one of my favorite parts when they have their fashion show! The ending made us tear up a little bit since we've seen the toys with Andy since the beginning, but it's a great movie.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|A well written adventure yarn, with just enough plot depth to keep you interested and wanting to come back for more!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I wanted a simple and easy calculator app for my Kindle Fire. This is the best one that I've found. I wanted it as close to a regular calculaor as possible and this is it.
1250007208|5.0|Cinder is a futureistic telling of the classic Cinderella fairytale.  Cinder is a cyborg (half robot half human) after a tragic accident in her childhood. Now she is shunned in society and spends her life being a mechanic to support her step-mother and step-sisters.  Cue a prince, a ball, and a romance.<br /><br />But the author then adds more layers onto the fairytale you know to make it even more magical and for an audience more than just kids. For example, the Lunars. A race that live on the moon that want to wage war on earth, and the deadly plague spreading all across earth. All together it makes a lovely novel for kids and adults alike. I cannot wait for the next one!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My daughter has alot of fun with this app on the Kindle Fire. I don't think that she's even used half of the different types of drawing things on it, yet. She loves the stamp markers and the fact that she can pick different papers to draw on.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Super beautiful every song is magical.  I love her voice and each song is so emotional, you feel like she wrote it just for you.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|My daughter (4 years old) likes this. My father & myself play the piano, so she's used to the instrument. She gets a kick that she's actually &#34;playing&#34; Christmas songs on the beginne level. It's easy for her to navigate through the menu, too.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great book! I love reading on my Kindle. It was on my Kindle within seconds of purchasing it. I haven't finished the book yet but I highly recommend it.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|My daughter played this on my sister's iphone, so she was begging for it for the Kindle Fire. It's fun, but I wish that there were more than 4 people to fix. Makeup would be a fun addition, as well. It does have alot of different things to do with the hair, but for me, there's just so many times that I can fix the hair the same exact way.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It's been real fun playing this game. But save your bombs you will need them later in the game. Worth playing
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My daughter actually rented this one by accident, but she was very happy to be able to watch it on the Kindle Fire. I make sure to turn off the wifi when she has it now, lol. Tangled is a fun Disney movie. Even my husband likes to watch it. So far everyone that I know who's seen it likes it.
B000JIHP88|5.0|It's very nice that my newborn baby look the colorful animals. The melodies are soft with excellent sound. I love the colorful animals to.

B0018QOIXU|5.0|I think Adele is a great singer/songwriter and cannot believe how young she was when she produced this work. Would recommend to everyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I WAS HESITANT ABOUT THE READING THIS BOOK.  THE REVIEWS WERE TO GOOD TO TRUE.  BUT THIS IS THE BEST READ EVER.  I READ THIS BOOK IN ONE DAY.  THE STATEMENT of a page turner IS TRUE and not over rated.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|It's new collection shows the growth in Adele's understanding. It is world class & has so many good tracks that you can identify with, recommended for anyone who enjoys music.

0312330855|3.0|Pages are somewhat yellowed from age.  Doesn't look very new, though cover is in very good condition.  Reprint in 2004, I believe.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|I loved the movie, enjoy the soundtrack, but wish they would have included all the songs(titanium). That was very disappointing.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|this is my &#34;go-to&#34; gift for little girls. My friends 3 year old now knows all the words and songs. It was my favorite movie as a kid and now I am enjoying passing it along to others.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book is ok.  I bought it because it was on the best sellers list.  I found it a little hard to get into.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Definitely a different side to Rihanna, but awesome sound and very fresh. I love Rihanna, and this is one of her best albums.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I watched the first season on Netflix, but as they did not have season 2 I purchased it from Amazon.  Most of those fans of British shows will probably enjoy this.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Great album, great rising artist with an awesome sound. I definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes rock/indy music.
B00755MHXG|5.0|Read this chapter per night with my 10 year old.  Really deals with many issues relating to bullying and disabilities, great way of helping a yound son to understand the power of positive behaviours and good mateship at school, loved the Julian character as everyone has a bad boy at middle school...
0596101996|5.0|The book contains more than I expected on the subject and I have been learning a lot with it since I got it.
1449410243|5.0|As a reluctant house cat owner, this is a very funny book.  It is so funny because so much of it is so true!
B005LAIGN2|3.0|We love movies about aviation and liked the movie &#34;Tuskeegee Airmen&#34; but this did not measurte up to our expectations.

B008Y1RTUG|5.0|Charlize Theron was wickedly engaging and the absolute epitome of the wickedness of vanity, what an absolutely stunning depiction, she was gorgeously brilliant.  The movie is slow in areas, but not a negative, as the cinematography was beautiful! Costumes and makeup, visual effects were Amazing! If you like stories of the battle of good and evil, virtue over vice, see it! If you like beautiful scenes and costumes of renaissance age, see it!

B0094LUH4A|2.0|This film was two hours of my life, that I won't be getting back. It was slow moving, not edited that well and the plot was pointless.  I have seen other films with minimal plot, but unlike this one, the characters were well developed.
B0055S348W|2.0|i cannot get this to work with my non-cloud ready printer.  i have a brother fax/scanner/printer/copier. ive tried everything and it simply will not work
B001NLKT60|5.0|One of the best books I read in a long time can't wait to read the next book defiantly gonna recommend to friend's
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The book was flat out fantastic.  I've never read a King before, and will certainly look into the books more.  His writing was engaging and funny at times.  The main character, Jake, had me laughing at the absurdity of his situation.  I love first person narrative as it makes me feel like I'm being told the story directly.  I found it interesting and appealing even how King would interweave the &#34;obdurate&#34; events linking Jake to the past.  There was an irony to it that I can't quite put into words.  Though the book is about the JFK assassination, it doesn't focus solely on that event and for that I'm glad.  It made me long for an era long gone, one that I've never even lived it.  I highly appreciated the detail and historical facts that he used to enrich the story.  The book is LONG and there's no getting around that.  Even when I was about 75% done, I was wondering how it would all wrap up in such little time left.  That said, it was an insanely fast read-took me maybe a week.  I will certainly read it again and again and have recommended it to my husband-as he loves historical fiction.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Funny, entertaining and romantic. Great story about what it's like to be married to the same person for years and years, and making it work.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|From Cheese is cute, with nice and mostly comprehensible wordless animations to explain what your goal is. I've only played about 30 levels, but the difficulty level seems very uneven. Also, the finger control can be a bit finicky, especially if you're trying to shave off half a second on your time to get the better result. Or if you go over an impassible object, such as a chair or wall, it makes a noise but still allows it, meaning you have to undo and redraw that section.<br /><br />  I'm not sure it's a fault of the game but with my expectations: I'd like more ways to solve the problem without having to meet special time or &#34;scent&#34; limits. Or for example, if I want to use the speedier scent, it appears that I have to use it all the way from the cheese that I want it. Or if the vacuum turns off, why doesn't the scent continue wafting? That might lead to some interesting timing puzzles. There might be more interesting puzzles later on, but right now the puzzles are either too easy or the few I have to skip entirely, and I don't find it compelling enough to continue. A minor quibble is that when you fail on a level with a starting animation, it replays that animation every time, making it better to hit the stop button quickly before it jumps to the fail and starting animations.
B0068FYZ84|5.0|this is everything i expected it to be. thank you for the bluray / dvd / digital copy. this is a good product.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of fun games to choose from. My favorite one is ALL of them. I can't believe it is a free app!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book kept me turning the page. I loved it. The ending haunted me. I wanted to read a sequel. I thought about it for days afterword.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|The songs you know in a great recording. I do never listen to a so good Jimi recording before. Go ahead!
0765325950|4.0|I really loved the 99% of the book; the final battle was really great, and I really was enthralled with the whole story; but the killing of Egween was a really sad, and I wish B.S. Hadn't done that. The final scenes after the victory where too brief, with no fleshing out of the possible future lives of the main characters or the people in the land. I thought that the scene of Rand riding off leaving everyone was not in accord with his personality; in the series, he only sought to settle down and return to a normal life, with a home and family; if that was Matt, it would have fit perfectly.<br />For me the last few pages spoiled a really great series that I loved. I hope that the powers that be, will reconsider some time in the future to re-write the ending, even if it isn't Mr. Sanderson that does it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My son and I are really enjoying the movies - we are reading the books also.  It is a collection to keep always.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this game is very fun to play after you get past the first couple sections. the sharing of gold between characters is a bit wonky but can be useful when used correctly. overall very well made with very few glitches if any.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After watching season 1 and 2 consecutively, we are hooked on season 3. We're looking forward to the rest of the season!
0345803485|3.0|I read this at the recommendation of my girlfriend who to get &#34;ideas.&#34; Some of it was fun to read, but I think the author tried to sound more articulte than she really is by using big college words. I thought the characters could have been developed better and the sex scenes were a disapointment because they were rushed through. each chapter was a repeat of the one before it. I'm typically a book horder, but this one I'll be donating to the library.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A friend gifted the it to me.  I found it entertaining during the trip (7.5 hr) to TN.  I laughed and cried.  Then I listened a second time on way home and laughed and cried.  I gifted to my sis-in-law and promptly brought copy for my I-Pad.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it, was more than I thought it would be. Can't wait to start Book 2!<br />Most definitely would recommend!
B008XG1X18|5.0|it has tons of diy and crafts and I love the quotes it gives me so many ideas and it is very addicting. very inspiring try it out
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I watch the TV series, Castle, so I can relate to the characters while reading. I will read the other books in this series.
0007444397|4.0|When my 13-year old niece opened it, she couldn't put it down.  For young fans who are also avid readers, this is a great choice. It's a very thick book, so I can't imagine what can take up so many pages!!  I can say the quality of the publishing was very good.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Very straightforward and to the point. Success is hard work and Darren Hardy provides some great strategies on how we can achieve success. Strategies that are simple and can easily be put into practice. One of the best!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game Rocks I wish I got it sooner everyone should get this game cuz it gives you all weapons and all supplies plus you get to go nonlinear and play online
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is very fun. My only wish is that gems were a tad easier to get. Maybe make conversions from bits available? Maybe something like 5,000 bits for a gem?
B005LAII12|1.0|however  OMG  what a bad movie  the few thigns that were funny i saw in the previews the only thing i enjoyed was seeing my hometown on the big screen  i remember when they were filming  i Cant believe they are making  a second one  i will not be buying that one
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game. I like the way the cards move and I also like the background choices.<br />I definitely recommend this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome it would be nice if you could get gems and coins easier but over all a great game!
B008R96NIY|4.0|This was an extreamly interesting book full of facts and really concentrated on the Eastern European issues prior to the Great war, a little dense in places and sometimes the I found the names confusing particularly as I read it on kindle and the going back to check was tiresome. If you have an interest in the Great war then its a great read.
B005FISC52|5.0|Very impressed with this item, should have ordered it before I did, spent less time finding it and that is good.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game is fun but a little too slow for me.  Hard to build up enough points to expand.<br />Great game for the younger generation.

B008KE3960|4.0|This is a pretty decent app. I downloaded this for a 4 hour plane ride, didn't become bored with it and i played it the whole time. Could it be improved? Sure. But all in all is worth checking out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it. It keeps you entertained the whole time. Dose not force you to buy gems with real money. Great game for horse lovers.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good book well written keeps you interested, wish there were more books available in the series, maybe a follow-up set of characters
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I have only one word for this book: Intense! This is a book about discovery,forgiveness, love and support and understanding. The depth of the characters feelings  is unbelievable, and the connection they have gives their relationship an intensity that not every author can bring to life as well as Colleen Hoover. This is an intense read!!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I heard that this was an \\"old people movie,\\" but I love many of the actors in the cast so I had to see it despite not being \\"old.\\" I am glad I didn't listen. This is an \\"everybody\\" movie.<br /><br />It's funny, honest, visually beautiful, and peaks into so many universal aspects of life that any adult will be able to appreciate it. Other than the main Indian boy, the acting is top notch. If you are feeling a bit depressed, unmotivated, or stuck, this might be a good movie to watch. It's very hopeful and uplifting. I highly recommend it if you can do without explosions, sex, violence, blood, and cursing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game with the little one :). this game keeps the both of us entertained for hours - I wouldn't say that it gets boring.
B0070066DI|3.0|I ordered one of these for a media center PC project using an Intel Core i3-3225 processor and an Intel DH67BL micro-ATX mainboard.  I needed something that would fit within a height-restricted case, do a good job of cooling, and be reasonably quiet.<br /><br />The heatsink itself cools well.  The base is polished to a mirror shine, and has a good level surface for making contact with the processor.  The fan is as quiet as they come; I can't speak to its longevity, as I haven't had the product long enough to make a fair judgment.  The unit does not have as much clearance for RAM as I thought; this would not be an issue if you choose memory without tall heatsinks and install it first, except for one thing.<br /><br />Mounting this unit in a Socket 1155 system at least, is awful.  I've built PCs for nearing twenty years, and getting the heatsink secure without breaking a mainboard is difficult.  Considering that the heatsink needs to be mounted when the mainboard is not yet installed inside the case, I could think of several methods that could have been engineered that would have worked as well without being so difficult or risky.  To avoid the risk of breakage, I removed the RAM after several attempts at installation, and then found I didn't have enough clearance to put it in once the unit was installed, and had to loosen the heatsink to get the memory installed.  At that point, I still could only use two of the four memory sockets due to not wanting to remove the heatsink fully and try again (note: if you have four sockets and want to use them all, do now, otherwise, you'll need to remove the mainboard at your next RAM upgrade).<br /><br />The instructions are very busy, and I'd rate them as average in explaining the task of mounting the heatsink.  I went mainly by the pictures, as the directions were tiny and limited.<br /><br />I don't know how many more of these will make American shores, as Scythe USA has ceased operations (I believe Scythe Japan is still up andrunning).  The unit is certainly improved at cooling over an Intel stock heatsink/fan, and if you have a small case and want to use a Core i5 or i7 or an AMD processor above 65w, this is still probably your best choice.  However, if you have a low-energy CPU, have more space to dedicate, or don't need whisper-quiet cooling, there are probably better choices out there.  If the mounting mechanism was modified, this would be a great unit, and I could easily give it another star or two.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|This app is terrible! Why is it bad, it brings up strange options and gives you viruses save yourself the trouble and avoid this app!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|the best game ever!if it only had lots more levels. me and my friend compete against each other. we just love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00755646W|5.0|If you like (usually love or not at all with Madonna) you'll want to get this in High Definition! It's the Madonna of the 80's-1990, filmed while on her massive &#34;Blond Ambition World Tour&#34;. Saw it live, it was an experience I'll never forget! The documentary part was filmed in 16mm black and white, the live performances from &#34;Blond Ambition&#34; are in lush 35mm full color film. The songs are not edited at all, they're in there entirety, as they should be from a performer of M's caliber! It's all, picture & sound, noticeably upgraded from the DVD. Well worth the upgrade, especially at the inexpensive price here. Unfortunately, the extra's of 2 more performances from the VHS, isn't on this release, just like the DVD. I still recommend it for the major advantage of seeing some into the life of a living legend when she was much more controversial. I like seeing the progression of a human being, a woman and an Icon!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This episode did not disappoint.  The quality and content are great.  We enjoy the option of being able to watch the episodes on our TV or Kindle Fire or any of our other devices.
1468179993|5.0|Have you ever sat down to read a book chapter... then read the whole book in one sitting... having highlighted so much of it you should have been crossing sentences out instead...? I haven't. Until right now. This is the most helpful book on public speaking that I've ever come across.<br /><br />Donovan is a self-described \\"public speaking super nerd\\" and being an analytical type, rather than a sales-y type, his advice is extraordinarily detailed. And therefore extraordinarily helpful.<br /><br />What makes this book different from all the others on the topic is that he's not telling you what he *thinks* are the features of a good public speaker, he's telling you what ARE the features of the BEST public speakers--with \\"best\\" measured empirically by the number of views of their TED talks.<br /><br />I'm a professor who teaches influence and persuasion classes. I've won awards for professional speaking, and spent thousands of hours in front of an audience--and Donovan's book is going to change my presentations and speeches in a hundred ways. For example, using the singular \\"you\\" to let each audience member feel they're being spoken to individually (rather than \\"all of you\\" or \\"we\\")... and choosing the right resolution for my graphics. Donovan breaks down types of openings and pre-openings, makes public speaking more of a science and less of an art. And therefore easier to master.<br /><br />Out of respect for the reader, and in the spirit of a great TED talk, there's no wasted space in Donovan's book. You can read it in one morning--what a treat you have ahead of you!
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has done justice to the Wheel of Time series by finishing the final book for Robert Jordan, who died before he had a chance to.  Brandon used Robert's notes and collaborated with his wife to make sure that the final book fitted perfectly into the series.  You cannot tell that someone else has completed the story that began all those years ago with the first book in the series......The Eye of the World.  The final book - A  Memory of Light, flawlessly continues the story and characters from the series, and you cannot tell where Robert Jordan ends and Brandon Sanderson took over the story telling.  Highly recommended.  A fantastic series.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|One of the most entertaining books I have read recently.  Mr. Jonasson's connection of events and timelines made the book seem almost believable.  Upon finishing the book at 4:47 am, I was tempted to immediately read it again for the delightful escape from reality.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This is a favorite in our household for kids and adults alike.  We sing along and my 2 and 3 year old kids sit still for this one
B008M36EEI|5.0|Highly recommended human interest story, with wit, charm, and emotion.  Excellent performances, and beautiful camera work  and a touching sotry make this movie worth seeing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this on my mom's ipad before she traded my stepdad for a laptop. Unbelievably fun and so interactive. Would def recommend to people of all. ages.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a beautiful story and I'm sure a lot of research had to have been done in order to put it together.  It made me cry several times.  I loved it!
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|This app is slow and not very user friendly to change locations & settings. I think there are better apps out there.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had never read anything by this author before, and didn't know what to expect.  It was recommended by Amazon for me, so I tried it and was at first put off by the fact that it was written more like a diary than the usual type novel.  However, I became so interested that I found that I admired the way the writer got around to emphasizing points that were interesting twists and turns in the story and how she wrote a story with a moral and something that I would recommend for young people.<br /><br />I am a Senior Citizen and I enjoyed this book enough to read the follow-up book she wrote.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great Harry! Enjoyed it from stem to stern. I need nine more words apparently, ow five, three, two, one, whew!
B009U9S6FI|4.0|I was far more interested in the first half than the second half. I heartily agree that purpose trumps pleasure every time!
B0086700CM|1.0|it keeps glitching, wont start up and stops unexpectedly in the middle of doing anything. had to uninstall it because could not get it to work.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I had never heard of Mackelmore before this and really like this album. It has a lot of good tracks and a little something for everyone.
B001O2QW9G|5.0|This turtle has become my girls favorite toy. They drag it all over the house and even fight over it (unfortunately)
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|We enjoy all Pixar movies. This is one of the best movies Pixar has came out with and it also has a good message.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was not disappointed. It was very similar to FSOG as far as story line and topic.I would recommend if you like books like these.
B004P4O87I|5.0|My grandsons loved this set. I have purchased several different Star Wars sets from Amazon and shipping was fast and the boys loved then all.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|To much vulgar language.If I would of known it was like this I wouldn't of rented it. Would not recommend it to any one
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing ...I truly connect with him. because so much of what happen to him happened to me...thank you ..<br />.
B0000WN0ZK|2.0|I understand how this movie was very influential and some of the directing techniques and extended scenes without dialogue were cutting edge.  However, the movie was just terrible!  I kept looking at the clock to see how much more I had to endure.  David Hemmings plays a photographer that is a huge jerk that likes to wander around and photograph things...that's of course when he is not insulting or dismissing the people around him.  The movie's lack of dialogue is supposed to be impressive in some way, but unfortunately it is just a big bore.  The movie even ends with a lengthy segment involving mimes \\"playing\\" tennis.  Just awful!!<br /><br />I gave this movie 2 stars vs. 1 star due to the influence that it had on future directors.  Two movies that were obviously inspired by \\"Blow Up\\" are Brian De Palma's film \\"Blow Out\\" and Dario Argento's \\"Deep Red\\".  Both of which were much more entertaining and suspenseful than this sleeping pill of a movie.<br /><br />I know, I know...I just don't \\"get it\\" or I'm too dumb to appreciate the subtleties...to each their own.  I definitely recommend you rent before buying.  Especially at the price listed as of this writing ($49.99)!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a really fun game but could be a little easier to navigate in the activity log. My sister LOVES it!
B004LROUNG|4.0|I'm a fan of Grisham and have read most every one of his books.  This one continues the trend of great story line and page turning interest in the characters and the details of the law that drive it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have not read the first book but watched the movie.  I didn't think I would enjoy the movie but to my surprise I did.  Therefore, I started reading the second book to see where it took me.  You can't read this one and not finish the series!  I have truly enjoyed envisioning the descriptive words to paint a whole picture.  Wonderfully written.....now on to the final chapter!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Every woman should read this book!  Cheryl Strayed writes with such intimacy as she relates her journey to self discovery and healing as she endures the hardship of completing the hike of a lifetime. Her story is raw and riviting and filled with hope for us all.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Iwould have given it four and one half stars but could not figure out how.  This book just hummed along. I read it in three sittings. The skill of the author takes you into the book's world. Nothing is simple.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another enjoyable Harry Bosch investigation.  We get to see a bit more of his home-life and growing relationship with his daughter.  There are some moments that keep the reader on the edge of his/her seat, though, there are some other Bosch stories that are a bit more exciting, in my opinion.  Keep em coming!!
0446547573|3.0|Nicholas Sparks is like an old friend, who you haven't seen in awhile, coming over for dinner.  You know exactly what to expect.  Girl meets boy.  Boy falls in love with girl. A tad bit of drama and then they live happily ever after.  This book is no exception.<br /><br />Subject wise this book is about trust and feeling secure. There are some heart pounding scenes which keep you engaged, and he tries a different approach with the ending.<br /><br />Over all it's another great book by Sparks.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|Classic Christmas Songs perfect for the holiday season. Very mellow and relaxed music. Zooey Deschanel has an amazing voice! Love it!
B009ZTSPCC|5.0|Being an Aerosmith fan for my entire life it was GREAT to see some new stuff come out from them.  I wouldn't mind seeing you do another Blues CD.  Honkin on Bobo is my Favorite.
B007C4ZJ3K|3.0|It was a good thing I did not have high expectations of this movie. The overall story line was interesting, but certain parts were poorly executed. At times, it was hard to keep up with what was going on. I will say, it is very cool Gina Carano performed her own stunts.
B00471TLZS|5.0|This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again.  If you haven't seen<br />it, you have missed a classic.
0307730697|5.0|This book really delivers. One of the best and most inspiring stories I have ever read. It's great to read a book that shows you a different side of life as an operator in one of the most elite units in special operations. Adam Brown is a hero with an incredible story. After finishing this book I felt more motivated, inspired, and fearless myself. Thinking of Adam's story helps me try harder at whatever it is I'm doing. If life knocks you down, you get back up and try again.
B007C4ZJ0S|3.0|I expected better because of the cast.  It was worth seeing. Had some good action.  I would recommend it to people who like action.
0525953728|5.0|The book was incredible and hard to put down. You are hooked and locked on at all times throughout from beginning to end. Don't really know what the whole fuss was about with DoD making noise over it. Didn't really think it had anything too confidential or secret that people couldn't have known... Anyhow, job well done by everyone involved in the mission. A must read for those interested in the elite special operations community, or anyone just looking for a book that will not disappoint. So glad to have this piece of history in my personal library.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Her music is outstanding.  She Bonamassa are stunning together.  It's like hearing<br />Etta and Aretha in one person.  I will buy everything she does.
B002RVCD0U|3.0|Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood, Michael Ironsides and giant killer robots? There's no way this isn't going to be a fun movie. Outstanding action and special effects abound. But there isn't an emotional core to really draw you in. It's a strangely unfocused and distanced treatment that mechanically plods on. The scene that reveals the major re-editing is the second meeting of John Conner with Marcus Wright. In the first, John Conner only sees Marcus as an inert slab in a secret Skynet lab. In the second, he sees Marcus after he has been injured and captured by the resistance. Then he says, \\"I thought I knew him.\\" Really? Clearly a more personal connection that might have given the events more meaning and emotional weight had been edited out. And if you didn't anticipate the big reveal from the introductory scenes, then perhaps it's a measure of how uninvolving the movie is.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Loved the movie but stopped working at the last part. I missed the best part of the movie. Technolgy can be so great but so bad.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|Being relatively new to the fantasy genre and just finishing 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series, I was trying to find a new book to read.  After searching around, I came across 'Gardens of the Moon'.  I did read some of the reviews and was hesitant to buy it; however, I decided I would give the book a chance.<br /><br />I do have to agree with the other reviews with regards to the first couple hundred pages, that is, that the book can be somewhat challenging to read, and even can be a little boring.  With a tremendous amount of characters being introduced and constantly switching locations, point of views, etc. - one can easily get lost with what is going on.  I can still recall times where I felt like giving up, but, I took the advice from the other reviews and continued.<br /><br />Like everyone else mentioned, once you get past that initial challenge, the remainder of the book was amazing.  The story has everything one can hope for in a fantasy book: good, evil, magic, creatures (won't spoil it), assassins, empires, etc.  Even though 'Gardens of the Moon' has all the normal elements of a fantasy book, Erikson puts his own unique twist with the story and makes this book very unique and very memorable. I believe this may be one of the reasons that the book is challenging - somewhat of a learning curve due to not following the typical fantasy blueprint.<br /><br />So would I recommend this book to anyone? Absolutely.  Once you finish reading the book, you will be glad you stuck with it and didn't give up.<br /><br />On a side note, I actually finished book 2 of the series a few days ago and I am currently reading book 3.  Book 2 is much easier to read and does build off of book 1.  I saw some reviews state you can skip book 1, but if you do this, you will miss out on a lot of character development and background material.  Book 2 doesn't use all of the same characters, but book 3 does reintroduce a lot of them. I personally liked book 1 more than book 2, but as of right now, book 3 is AMAZING.
B009KNPNT6|5.0|I enjoyed taking a stroll into Clapton's past and listening to studio and live recordings of some of his classics!

0767827716|3.0|When this movie arrived it had several stains on the cover. When opened it had dirt in it, and when we played it, it froze at a few parts.
0307740919|5.0|HOME<br /><br />This slim 147 page book is a treasure.  It is packed with wisdom, kindness, love, and the human factor.  Toni Morrison is a very wise woman.<br /><br />Frank Money is a Korean war vet.  He 'escaped' his hometown of Lotus, Georgia, by enlisting in the service with his two buddies.  He is the only one to return home. He comes back to America a haunted man; he cannot get the vivid reality of the war out of his mind and suffers in many ways. But does he return to Lotus, Georgia, a place he has grown to hate with a passion?<br /><br />Cee, his younger sister, the girl Frank looked after her entire life, has not had it so good either.  Left pretty much on her own after her adored big brother joined the service, she is swept off her feet by the first man who pays any attention to her -- and attention is what Cee is craving.  Now, alone, rejected, and in a different city she is desperately attempting to make a life for herself without her big brother and his protection and love.<br /><br />The book is written in the format I love -- each character telling their tale, and jumping back and forth in an easy to understand way.  Frank returns from the war haunted and in a sad mental condition; Cee is working hard for her money and trying to make her dreams come true.  Their lives play out on the pages like a harp; sweet, sad, quivering with hope and desires, along with rejection and anguish from the past.<br /><br />Cee and Frank are the main characters in this book, but meet up with a host of others. As Frank and Cee try to make some head-way in this business called life, they meet up with a cast of characters that are from many different walks of life and treat Frank and Cee in many different ways.  Most are kind, many are cruel, and the actions of these people has a profound effect on their lives.  Both Frank and Cee vow to never return to Lotus, Georgia, their home.<br /><br />However, after a long, exciting, and memorable journey for both brother and sister, Frank and Cee do eventually end up back in Lotus, Georgia.  Can they ever heal from the wounds they have suffered both mentally and physically?  Can they ever be happy back in the place they swore never to return to?  Do brother and sister still care strongly and deeply for one another?  Read this wonderful book and find out.<br /><br />I read my first Morrison book quickly, filled with excitement and quite frankly, with awe for Morrison's writing.  Her talent to dive right into the heart and soul of her characters and make her readers feel so many different emotions while reading her work is a gift.  This certainly will not be my last book to read by Miss Toni Morrison.  I loved her thoughts, her writing, her genius.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />PamFrank and Cee do eventually end up back in Lotus, Georgia.

B004LWZW42|5.0|an interesting take on telling the origins of Xavier and Magneto by showing they were not always enemies, if you're a fan of X-Men get this dvd
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|This has been compared to &#34;As Good As It Gets&#34;, but that movie had a good story line, humor, and it just felt good.  I love Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones, but this movie was just depressing, the characters lacked depth, and I'm not a movie reviewer but my guess is just that the story was horribly written.  I expected some humor because of Steve Carrell, but it just wasn't there.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|i'm not much of a Mel Gibson fan but this is one of his few films i actually enjoy. if you are into learning about William Wallace this film does it's job of telling the tale of Wallace.
